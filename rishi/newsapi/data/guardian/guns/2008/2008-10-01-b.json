  "<p><strong>Director: Alan Parker<br>Entertainment grade: D<br>History grade: E+<br></strong></p> <p>Eva Duarte, known affectionately as Evita, was an actress who married Colonel Juan Per\u00f3n and became First Lady of Argentina. She went on to oversee the ministries of labour, social welfare and health, eventually becoming her husband's vice-president. He gave her the title of Spiritual Leader of the Nation in 1952, a few months before her death from cancer at the age of just 33.</p> <h2>Society</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177640\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita5220.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The film opens with public mourning after Evita's death. In a stableyard, sepia-toned workers dance a tango of sorrow. Later, there will also be a tango of sexual discovery in a milonga, and a tango of political rivalry amid swaying sides of beef in an abbatoir. Add in a polo match, which the film does, and you've nearly got a full checklist of Argentina-related clich\u00e9s. The only thing missing is football.</p> <h2>Casting</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita1220.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Madonna certainly has the iconic status to play Evita as a political leader. The problem is that, at 38, she has to spend the first half hour playing her as a 15-year-old girl. You're supposed to think her 36-year-old lover, Agust\u00edn Magaldi, is a sleazy old paedo. But they look about the same age \u2013 making their relationship unproblematic, as long as you can get past the fact that he is played by Jimmy Nail from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. In any case, the real Eva probably didn't have a relationship with Magaldi.</p> <h2>Dialogue</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita8220.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <br>Magaldi sings Eva a song about how hard life will be for her in Buenos Aires, where you have to be middle class to get on. \"Screw the middle classes!\" she trills, a capella. \"I will never accept them!\" That would be foreshadowing. Tim Rice's lyrics get dafter still with The Lady's Got Potential, a song describing Eva as \"the greatest social climber since Cinderella\" because she knew \"the right fella to be stellar.\" It then recounts the 1943 military coup and Juan Per\u00f3n's emergence mostly by using the words \"kapow, die\". Actually, that's fair enough.</p> <h2>People</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177643\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita4140.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"140\" height=\"190\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the background lurks Che Guevara (Antonio Banderas), Evita's creepy stalker, turning up at various points in her life to make catty remarks and remind her of her impending death. In real life, the two never met, though the young Guevara did once write Evita a letter asking her to buy him a jeep. It was a joke. Probably you had to be there.</p> <h2>Politics</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177644\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita3220.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <br>At a benefit gig for victims of the earthquake of 1944, Eva meets Juan Per\u00f3n. There's an immediate attraction, and they get together that same night. Right so far, but it all deteriorates when Eva's rise to power is reduced to a makeover: \"The people, they need to adore me! So Christian Dior me!\" Not much here about her support of the campaign for women's suffrage, her creation of the Female Peronist Party, her work in government, or even the dubious rumours of her links to fascist regimes. No, apparently it was all just hats and lipstick.</p> <h2>Death</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177645\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita7220.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <br>People are getting beaten up by the army outside a cathedral while Eva prays inside. \"Why try to run a country when you can become a saint?\" sneers Banderas. That's a bit rich coming from Che Guevara: how many people wearing Che t-shirts can list his achievements as president of the National Bank of Cuba? Meanwhile, Eva starts looking a bit peaky and eventually, to the audience's relief, Argentina does get to cry for her.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338177646\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/evita9220.jpg\" alt=\"Evita\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It's pretty weird to imply chemistry between Che Guevara and Eva Per\u00f3n, but at least that is obviously fictional. Far worse are the tissue-thin characterisations of Evita as a famous lady who liked dresses, and of Che as a grumpy man who was a bit cross with stuff. Picture-perfect sets and costumes aside, there's not much to redeem this superficial biopic. Kapow, die.</p>",
  "<p>If Lewis Hamilton does irony - I'm not sure that formula one drivers do - he may be pondering this particular one. In a sensational debut season, he missed out on the drivers' championship and was the most popular and beloved sportsman in the country. Now, after an even more impressive follow-up year, he looks set to win the thing - all the more so when he went seven points clear in the championship at Singapore last weekend - and no one seems all that bothered. Odds are that, even if he does become the first Briton to take the title in more than a decade, he'll be beaten to BBC Sports Personality of the Year by a Mansfield swimmer no one had heard of until six weeks ago. </p> <p>Even as the formula one season reaches a climax, it's hard to avoid the ambivalence towards Hamilton. Some have gone off him a bit, others have stopped noticing him. I'm sure he hasn't changed from the fresh-faced rookie of last year, the real person whose humble backstory, down-to-earth approach and boyish enthusiasm for cars we could all relate to. He's probably still as caring a son, as devoted a brother, as passionate a sportsman. And he is a better driver than ever. So where has our creeping apathy come from?</p> <p>You don't have to look any further than formula one's patent-approved, tried-and-tested personality-leaching machine. You could see it at work on Hamilton from the very start of the year, starting with his decision to move to the incomparably rock 'n roll nation of Switzerland (because, lest we forget, he was getting too much sass from shoppers in Stevenage supermarkets). Quickly, he lost the ability to say anything interesting in public and the mischievous side that we glimpsed last year - even his sense of humour - seemed to die by the day.</p> <p>There's something impressively clinical in the way modern-day formula one sucks the colour and character out of its stars. And this in a sport that once boasted more playboys than a Hugh Hefner stag weekend. Since the 1990s - under the influence of the relentless and robotic Michael Schumacher - the devil-may-care image of motorsport has been replaced with a bland new world of corporate sheen. Formula one drivers - men who can out-gadget James Bond - now seem to have all the sex appeal of high street accountants. Serious, hardworking and well paid, yes; likely to get the blood pumping, no.</p> <p>With so much money at their disposal and so very many supermodels, helicopters and casinos to spend it on, you'd think these men would make fascinating public figures. Notwithstanding tales of Kimi Raikkonen pulling his trousers down in nightclubs, watch his press conferences and you'd think he spends his evenings reading the train timetable. I'm not saying that we want him getting his kicks in public. Just to be reminded that these commercial frontmen have a human side. Even the \"bad boy\" of the track, Fernando Alonso, seems to have succumbed to industrial torpor - there's been nary a peep out of him all year.</p> <p>Other sports are making their stars more personable, and trying to create engaging role models, but formula one drivers are happy to remain distant and cold. I know it's not all their own fault. Those helmets, for instance, don't help. How can you feel close to a sportsman when he spends more screen-time behind his tinted visor than Darth Vader? Sports lovers are an emotional bunch, we like to see our heroes grunting with effort, wincing in pain, even crying, dammit! Hamilton could be having a nervous breakdown beneath that helmet and we'd never know. </p> <p>I blame the protectionism of Bernie Ecclestone's travelling circus and the mentality of the triple-glazed, electric-fenced, shoot-on-sight paddock. Every part of the formula one experience is handed to us sterilised and hermetically sealed; every driver appearance is a climate-controlled commercial exercise. It's not just that this show is run by control freaks who don't want us to see how it all works. There's a real whiff - detectable even from the TV - of patronage; that this sport is being played by and for a breed more rarefied, and wealthier, than us, and we should be grateful to be allowed to watch along on our plebeian televisions. </p> <p>I really love motorsport. I even love formula one. But I wish it would get down from its pedestal and start acting like it was made of a piece with the rest of us. In MotoGP Valentino Rossi - one of the highest-earning sportsmen in the world - saturates his sport with his vivacious, volatile, slightly mad personality, and is adored for it. Maybe once Hamilton has this championship safely stowed, we could see him take a real risk - and let his hair down.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of packets of biscuits contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine were ordered off shop shelves in the UK yesterday, following an alert from the Food Standards Agency.</p> <p>Inspectors were dispatched to Chinese supermarkets and independent retailers across the country to remove and destroy the biscuits after officials in the Netherlands said 3,500 packets of contaminated biscuits had been shipped to Britain.</p> <p>The alert marks the first case of melamine-contaminated food to arrive in the UK since the health scare in China, in which tens of thousands of babies have been taken ill and four have died due to kidney problems after drinking Sanlu infant formula containing the chemical. </p> <p>Yesterday it was revealed that the company at the heart of the scandal asked officials to help conceal the extent of the problem, according to China's state media.</p> <p>The authorities had already said that officials in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, where Sanlu is based, sat on a report from the company for more than a month before telling provincial bosses. </p> <p>But in yesterday's People's Daily, a city government spokesman, Wang Jianguo, said Sanlu asked for help in \"managing\" the media response to the case when the firm informed the authorities of the problem on August 2. Parents had begun complaining to the firm by the end of 2007.</p> <p>According to the paper, Sanlu's letter asked the government to \"increase control and coordination of the media, to create a good environment for the recall of the company's problem products. This is to avoid whipping up the issue and creating a negative influence in society.\"</p> <p>Wang said his colleagues sent a team to investigate as soon as they became aware of the issue. But the People's Daily pointed out that they did not inform the provincial government until September 9.</p> <p>\"We mistakenly thought that taking necessary measures and raising product quality could mitigate the effect and reduce losses,\" said Wang.</p> <p>Firms around the world have since been forced to withdraw a range of products due to health concerns.</p> <p>Britain's Food Standards Agency said the Chinese biscuits, which have not been distributed to major supermarkets, were being withdrawn as a precaution and were unlikely to pose a significant health risk.</p> <p>Dutch authorities raised the alarm yesterday after tests on Koala brand biscuits, manufactured by Lotte China Foods Co, found the biscuits contained nearly twice the precautionary limit of melamine at 4.98mg a kilo. Import checks revealed that 168kg of the biscuits had been sent on from the Netherlands to Britain. </p> <p>The FSA has withdrawal alerts on four products: Koala chocolate cookies, Koala strawberry cookies, Koala yummy cookies chestnut and Koala melon cookies.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling intervened twice with the Irish government on behalf of UK banks yesterday amid fears that Dublin's blanket guarantee for savers was causing an exodus of funds across the Irish Sea.</p> <p>As the Irish government sought to rush legislation through the Dail to protect its banks, Treasury sources said last night that the Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, was told \"in no uncertain terms that the scheme was a problem for the UK\".</p> <p>Lenihan told Darling that the decision to safeguard all deposits at six banks had not been planned, but had been an emergency move to prevent the collapse of one Irish bank leading to the failure of another.</p> <p>The Treasury said last night that the chancellor had been given a sympathetic hearing. Darling made two calls in response to signs that savers were rushing to open accounts at Irish-backed banks, including the UK Post Office, whose accounts are provided by Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>Under pressure from furious high street banks, the chancellor urged Lenihan to make the scheme open to British banks operating in the republic.</p> <p>Last night, in a sign that the chancellor's concerns had hit home, Lenihan indicated that he would consider applications from non-Irish-owned banks with tangible presence in Irish cities and towns to be considered in the guarantee scheme.</p> <p>Dublin was unrepentant about the scheme, which has drawn criticism from elsewhere in Europe, hinting that France might follow suit. Paris denied the suggestion. Instead, President Nicolas Sarkozy is floating the idea of a \u20ac300bn lifeboat for European banks, a plan that appears to have little support in Britain and Germany.</p> <p>Anglo Irish Bank, which offers a telephone-based savings account in the UK, experienced one of its busiest days ever. Allied Irish Bank said it had been similarly deluged, leading to concerns that the savings market was being unfairly distorted at a time when UK banks feel they need every penny.</p> <p>Like the UK, Irish banks lent liberally during the housing bubble, and it is thought that the bank that came near to failing had been extending loans worth 110% of property values.</p> <p>Darling was told by Lenihan that Ireland was not seeking to undermine British banks, but that it had been forced to act to save the financial system from collapse. The chancellor said the scheme could have significant repercussions for Britain, including weakening the value of the pound.</p> <p>Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, will write to the Irish government today to complain about the distortion of competition caused by the security of Irish deposits.</p> <p>The Irish guarantee scheme covered six domestic institutions - Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life &amp; Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Education Building Society - much to the frustration of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, which have large Irish operations.</p> <p>RBS said its Ulster Bank operation \"intended to apply to join the scheme and expects to be successful\". The UK's savings guarantee scheme is being increased from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000 to bolster confidence, but does not contain the explicit guarantee that savings beyond this figure will be safe.</p> <p>In practice, when Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley got into difficulties, the government moved to ensure depositors were protected, suggesting that in practice no saver would lose out if another big bank went bankrupt. Despite this, savers have been voting with their feet.</p> <p>Yesterday it was difficult to get through to the Treasury-backed and 100% secure National Savings &amp; Investments. All the Irish banks were also busy. The nationalised Northern Rock has been another recipient of disenchanted savers' cash as they look to avoid the next at-risk bank. \"It's been our busiest day for years,\" said a call centre operator at Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>A Post Office spokeswoman said: \"Since last week when the government first changed the amount that was protected, we have seen a significant increase [in savings customers].\"</p> <p>A Bank of Ireland spokeswoman said there was growing evidence British savers were moving cash to the bank. She said the bank was seeing a \"very, very steady\" increase in people contacting its call centres from Northern Ireland; the pattern was thought to be the same across the UK. After weeks of ad hoc meetings to deal with the financial crisis, Gordon Brown is to set up an emergency committee of finance chiefs to coordinate responses similar to the Cobra body on emergencies.</p>",
  "<p>A recession is looming, money markets are teetering on the brink, and families and business leaders alike are slashing their budgets.</p> <p>But none of this is stopping a college in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, from flying its entire teaching staff to Marbella for a conference.</p> <p>Around 80 members of staff from Edensor Technology College will today check into the Andalucia Plaza Hotel near Puerto Ban\u00fas, while their students are off school for the rest of the week. </p> <p>The 380-room hotel boasts three swimming pools, a sauna, poolside bar, beauty salon and fitness centre, and is near a casino and several golf courses.</p> <p>The headteacher, Richard Mercer, denied that the trip was a \"jolly\" for his employees, and said it was more cost-effective to hold the training event at the four-star hotel than at a venue in the UK.</p> <p>The school declined to comment on the cost, but Mercer said that the school governors had considered nine venues in the UK and abroad before booking the trip 10 months ago. </p> <p>He told The Stoke Sentinel: \"It's unbelievable, but it's more cost effective to go abroad as it's the end of Marbella's season. We looked at conference facilities in Birmingham and London, but they are even more expensive.\" </p> <p>At the meeting, teachers will discuss the school's new curriculum and plans to turn it into an academy, Mercer said. </p> <p>He said: \"If parents think this is a 'jolly' they should join us and find out how hard the staff work.\" </p> <p>In a statement released later through Stoke-on-Trent city council, Mercer said: \"A full training programme, which is being led by reputable international speakers, is in place. We are investing in training our staff to ensure the continuity of quality education for our pupils.\" </p> <p>The two-day conference will be held tomorrow and Saturday, and staff will fly home on Sunday. </p> <p>Meanwhile, pupils have been set tasks to complete at home. </p> <p>Parents greeted the news with incredulity, and asked why the meeting could not be held at the school.</p> <p>Peter Robson, 38, of Longton, said: 'We received a letter saying the school would be shut for training days, but it didn't mention anything about Marbella. It sounds like a waste of money when they could have held a meeting in the school.'</p> <p>Another parent, Andy Sales, aged 34, of Fenton, said: \"Why isn't this money being spent on our kids? Parents are having to take time off work or are paying for extra childcare while the staff are enjoying the sun at the school's expense.\" </p> <p>The mayor of Stoke-on-Trent, Mark Meredith, said: \"At a time of global financial crisis this is not the message that a Stoke-on-Trent school should be delivering ... Whether it's cost effective or not, this is doing damage to the reputation of our schools.\" </p> <p>Last night, a spokesman for the hotel said: \"It's not at all unusual. This is a very comfortable hotel. We have a range of conference rooms and we're just a few minutes from the beach.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cowering behind thick black spectacles and quavering in his extraordinarily soft, old man's voice, Richard Ayoade is forced to describe the embarrassing successes and unmerited achievements of his life so far. His school band was \"the worst ever\". He became president of the \"very uncool\" Cambridge Footlights because \"there was a big shortage of people\" and performed \"massively mediocre\" comedy. After \"wasting everyone's time\" with stand-up, he began directing music videos thanks to a \"fortuitous\" meeting, and his first ever video - for Arctic Monkeys' Fluorescent Adolescent - was only nominated for the inaugural UK Music Video Awards \"because the song is so good\". He is best known for his portrayal of uber-nerd Moss in Channel 4's The IT Crowd but has a \"miniscule range\" and no other acting offers. \"I'm not sure I'd hire myself in anything. I certainly couldn't be an actor. That would be terrible. For everyone.\"</p> <p>In short, this 31-year-old actor/writer/director would have you believe he is a hopeless loser. \"This probably illustrates why I haven't done many ... um, you know,\" he tails off. \"I'm just terrible. At talking. With words.\"</p> <p>The trouble is, despite Ayoade's protestations, he is probably the coolest man in London right now. His film of Arctic Monkeys in concert will be shown in cinemas this month. He has directed videos for Vampire Weekend and the Last Shadow Puppets. He is adapting a novel for a film and shooting the third series of the IT Crowd. Women adore him (he doesn't tell me this; they do) and he reluctantly admits to being friends with Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner (\"partly because he lives in London now\") and the Mighty Boosh, in which he appears (\"Everyone in the cast is their friend, really\").</p> <p>It is hard not to prod someone who so shyly plays everything down. You are one of the coolest men in the capital, aren't you, I say. He shifts uncomfortably. \"No. I really don't think I'm cool. I'm not.\" He scrabbles around desperately for evidence. \"I don't know anything about computers. I resisted getting the internet for a long time. Even saying, 'Getting the internet' ...\" You'll soon be in various style magazines' \"cool lists\", I prod. \"I don't think I'm in danger of that,\" he replies with conviction.</p> <p>Ayoade is an only child. His Norwegian mother and Nigerian father met in London and the family moved to Ipswich when he was young. What was it like growing up there? \"I have no particular ill to speak of Ipswich. It was fine,\" he says. \"I just apologise in advance for being very unexciting, which will continue.\" As a teenager, Ayoade discovered grunge - \"lots of people going into guitar shops and playing the first four chords of Smells Like Teen Spirit\" - and would patiently wait for \"indie week\" on the Chart Show, which came around every three weeks with 30-second clips of Nirvana or the Pixies. Aged 15, he went to Brixton Academy to see his heroes, Dinosaur Jr. \"I was standing in what I thought was a really good position, quite close, and everyone just started jumping up and down. I lost half a tooth immediately. I didn't know everyone jumped up and down. Because I was from Ipswich.\"</p> <p>There were no drama classes at his Catholic boys' school but Ayoade volunteered to do some comedy with the Footlights when he pitched up at Cambridge to study law. It was the proving ground for John Cleese, Stephen Fry, Sacha Baron Cohen and so on, although Ayoade insists he is not being \"disingenuous\" when he says it was not popular at all - although Peep Show's David Mitchell was a member when he was a first-year student - and he became president by default. \"No one wanted to do it, so it wasn't like having to fight through swaths of people,\" he says with typical hesitancy. \"I don't think this is a lie.\"</p> <p>With co-writer Matthew Holness, Ayoade took his spoof horror comedy stage show, Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight, to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2000 and won the Perrier comedy award there in 2001. Two Channel 4 series - Garth Marenghi's Darkplace and Man to Man with Dean Learner - followed, alongside roles in Nathan Barley and The Mighty Boosh after Ayoade met and performed with Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding at the Edinburgh Fringe.</p> <p>Since then, he has become best known for The IT Crowd. To play Moss, the director pointedly instructed him: \"He's the geekiest person in the world. Just do it in your own voice.\" Ayoade's unique style of speaking elevates Moss above the Mr Muscle stereotype as does his understanding that true nerds are completely unselfconscious (unlike Ayoade). He based Moss on stage-show technicians. \"The main attribute that they seem to share is an enthusiasm for life. They are all very positive. You go, 'How are you?' and they go, 'Great! I've just bought a dog!' and it's very charming and not mean-spirited in any way.\"</p> <p>Things took a more unusual turn when Ayoade had a meeting with a film company, Warp, to discuss script ideas and mentioned that he would love to direct a music video. Through Warp's connections, he met Arctic Monkeys in Sheffield and created the video for Fluorescent Adolescent, a funny and surreal clown fight in the style of The Sweeney. Since then, he has made a flurry of videos, including Vampire Weekend's Oxford Comma - a one-shot video of \"revolutionary farmers\" that \"looks Wes Anderson-y and was meant to look more Godard-y but not in a po-faced way\" - and Super Furry Animals' Run Away - \"like a Serge Gainsbourg TV special, a very melodramatic story\".</p> <p>Old cars are an Ayoade trademark. \"I like people playing guitars leaning up against cars or in a field. It's a bit like Monty Python being in a field playing instruments,\" he says. \"Cars are good for entrances and exits. And there is something about driving that is quite cliched in a funny way. I like Roy Orbison's video for I Drove All Night because it's so literal. It is just a man driving throughout the night. I like that silliness. To be in a video is a ridiculous thing. It's almost impossible to do it without any humour.\"</p> <p>Despite his meticulousness (Ayoade listens to a song \"about 500 times\" to match his vision to its pace and music) and esoteric references (his smoky, atmospheric video for the Last Shadow Puppets' My Mistakes Were Made For You was inspired by Federico Fellini's cult film Toby Dammit), Ayoade's videos are playful and funny. He particularly admires Spike Jonze, who made the videos for the Beastie Boys' Sabotage and Weezer's Buddy Holly. Apart from Dinosaur Jr and Kings of Leon, he would most like to direct \"a nunsploitation\" for Girls Aloud \"with them as nuns but in a horror setting. The nun chainsaw video. But I'm sure that's probably not a direction they are going in,\" he says.</p> <p>He certainly has a winning pitch based on the success of Fluorescent Adolescent, which failed to reach No 1 unlike most of their earlier singles. \"Arctic Monkeys' song was so clearly brilliant,\" he says, \"so I'm able to bring a unique brand of commercial failure to the most successful people.\"</p> <p>Ayoade is now adapting Submarine, the acclaimed debut novel by Joe Dunthorne, which tells the darkly comic tale of an intellectual teenager who tries to solve his parents' marital difficulties. He hopes to direct the film next summer. Until then, he may have to cope with winning some awards and getting recognised on the street. He gets approached a bit, which is fine, he says, because \"there's a level of slight justified contempt that you can have for comedians\". He shifts awkwardly. \"If I am introduced to anyone, I find it incredibly embarrassing - and that's quite an immature position to have arrived at, at my age. It's obviously awkward but I don't mean that in an ungrateful way\".</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Ayoade is nominated in the Best Director and Best Rock Video categories at this year's UK Music Video Awards on October 14</p>",
  "<p>In the most astonishing state funeral held in modern times, the lowly millions of Egypt today took over the ceremonial burial of President Nasser from the assembled leaders of the world.</p> <p>They turned out in millions to demonstrate their grief, wept, ran, collapsed and struggled to get near the cortege, and disrupted the preplanned ritual. Mr Kosygin and the rest of the leaders who had flown to Cairo got no more than a few yards along the route before they had to abandon their attempts to lead the mourners.</p> <p>Shortly before ten o'clock a green helicopter flew over the city centre bearing the body from Kubbeh Palace, where it had lain in state, to the headquarters of the Revolutionary Council on Gezira Island.</p> <p>The funeral began in the cool gardens of the headquarters. Here, in a stately edifice among the lawns and palm trees running down to the edge of the Nile, the young President and his \"free officers\" ruled the country [early in] the revolution. Here they governed Egypt during the Suez crisis of 1956. Here distinguished mourners had assembled from 70 countries.</p> <p>In the distance one could hear the vague murmur of countless thousands, women wailing, men chanting. Then the coffin of the late president descended from the sky and one saw how fragile was the surface calm.</p> <p>The coffin was placed on a flower-smothered catafalque surrounded by mourners. King Hussein stood in tears next to Emperor Haile Selassie.</p> <p>The coffin was transferred to a gun carriage for the procession. A soldier on the roof of the Revolutionary Council building broke into wild shouts, \"Farewell, Gamal, farewell, Gamal\", and hurled his grief at the dignitaries below.</p> <p>From then on decorum was thrown to the wind. It seemed that a million Egyptians were weeping at once. A deep sadness was imprinted on the faces of the soldiers lining the route. Army and police had been given strictest orders that under no circumstances were they to open fire. But, when it had taken the gun carriage nearly an hour to get through the quarter mile to the mainland, they had to take some restraining action.</p> <p>The Army escort used its truncheons freely. All semblance of order had now disappeared - the kings, emperors, prime ministers and dignitaries who had travelled to bear witness to their sorrow were absent and forgotten. All that remained was the bright dot of the coffin surrounded by the heaving mass of the people who had worshipped Nasser for 18 years.</p>",
  "<p>Nicolas Sarkozy will launch crisis talks today to save France's ailing newspaper industry, amid union concerns that he could loosen ownership laws, allowing his television baron friends to buy into the national press. </p> <p>Sarkozy, who is nicknamed the \"t\u00e9l\u00e9-pr\u00e9sident\" for his media obsession and controversial influence over key parts of the TV and press, recently warned that \"democracy cannot function with a press permanently on the edge of an economic precipice\". He has ordered two months of industry consultations led by one of his former Elys\u00e9e advisers. </p> <p>The French press, among the least profitable in Europe, is lurching from crisis to crisis. The daily circulation of all French national papers totals 8m - half that of the UK and one third of Germany. The biggest daily seller in France is the sports paper L'Equipe. French newspapers' combined turnover plummeted from \u20ac1.145bn (\u00a3905m) in 2000 to \u20ac848m last year, and crises have hit dailies such as Le Monde, Lib\u00e9ration and Le Figaro. </p> <p>It costs more to print a national paper in France than its European neighbours because printworks are tightly controlled by the communist union, Le Livre, which has rigid hours and protections. Labyrinthine state controls of newspaper kiosks mean it is hard to find French papers on sale, especially beyond Paris. </p> <p>The French state gives \u20ac1.5bn in direct and indirect state aid to the press each year. Keen to cut that budget, Sarkozy has ordered discussions on distribution, the role of journalists in society, and competition with free papers and the internet. </p> <p>Le Monde's editor, Eric Fottorino, said Sarkozy must make it easier for the public to \"find\" a copy of a newspaper to buy. Lib\u00e9ration's editor, Laurent Joffrin, said the consultation should be open to the public and \"newsrooms' independence\" should be protected. </p> <p>French newspapers, where it is routine for politicians' offices to change copy and write their own question-and-answer interviews for publication, are suffering from their perceived lack of editorial freedom. In one recent poll, 57% of French people felt journalists were not independent in the face of political parties. </p> <p>The president has come under fire for his media baron friendships, influence over TV and radio appointments, and scandals over censorship and airbrushing in publications owned by his friends. Most recently, Paris Match accidentally ran a photo of Sarkozy with three legs after an attempt to airbrush a bodyguard out of shot went wrong. </p> <p>Sarkozy's favoured solutions to the press crisis include loosening a French law that bans any media organisation from simultaneously owning a major TV station, a major radio network and a major daily newspaper. But his political opponents and journalist unions fear newspapers risk being swallowed by industrial giants such as the construction group Bouygues, which controls France's biggest private TV channel, TF1, and whose chief executive is one of Sarkozy's best friends.</p>",
  "<p>The sound of silence between Arsenal's players on the pitch can sometimes be deafening, so it is perhaps just as well that Emmanuel Adebayor is aiming for a higher plane of communication with his strike partner, Robin van Persie.</p> <p>Theirs is a burgeoning relationship. It was not allowed to flourish last season because of Van Persie's frustrations with a succession of injuries but the early signs are that this time out, the pair are forming the basis of an intuitive understanding.</p> <p>\"That's what we're trying for,\" said Adebayor, in response to a comment that the best partnerships have an almost telepathic feel. \"At the moment, we are trying to create a relationship and against Porto we have shown quite well that we can do something together. Everyone is pleased.\"</p> <p>The 4-0 Champions League win over Porto on Tuesday at the Emirates Stadium, in which Adebayor and Van Persie shared the goals with two apiece, was studded with positives, chief among them that the result represented a sure step forward after Saturday's shock 2-1 home defeat by Hull City in the Premier League. But the Adebayor-Van Persie double act was a significant tonic.</p> <p>Their best moment was the opening goal when Adebayor, having sliced through the Portuguese champions' defence on to Cesc F\u00e1bregas' delightful ball, waited and waited before cutting back from the right for the arrival of Van Persie, who had strained every sinew to get there ahead of his markers. The Dutchman returned the compliment for the second goal, albeit from a right-wing corner that Adebayor headed down and in.</p> <p>\"I gave him a pass, he gave me a pass so this means it's a good relationship between Robin and me,\" said Adebayor. \"The most important thing is that we are working hard for the team. He has the same ambition as me. We are here to win the team something.\"</p> <p>It is impossible to say whether Van Persie's presence for the whole of last season would have helped Arsenal to the extra five points that they needed to win the league title, unless you sit on an independent three-man arbitration panel, convened under Football Association law. But Adebayor is excited about the potential of Arsenal's strike force if it can go unchecked by injury.</p> <p>\"Robin is a good player and if he is fit for the whole season, we have a chance to do something special, that's for sure,\" he said. \"I don't know if his absence last season was a key factor. We know that if we had all our squad fit, Robin, Eduardo [da Silva], [Bacary] Sagna ... we had the chance to win something. But now we have quite a lot of players ready and fit to play in every single game and that's good for the manager. </p> <p>\"I'm very happy that Robin is looking fit and scoring a lot of good goals. We're just enjoying playing together up front, I'm using him and he's using me. Of course, there's more to come from us, he's just back and we've only had five or six games together [this season] but hopefully, as we go game to game, we will learn better how each other plays.\"</p> <p>The pair recently filmed an advertisement together for their boot sponsors and their friendship off the field can only help their understanding on it. \"He's not like my best friend ever, but we are good friends. He's a good guy and sometimes we go to restaurants together.\"</p> <p>Caution must underpin the optimism. Van Persie made a flying start to last season, scoring seven goals in 11 matches for Arsenal before he damaged his knee for the first time on international duty with Holland last October. He scored only two more for the club all season. This time he has five so far, Adebayor has six, and if both players can stay fit, there is sure to be healthy competition between them for who can finish as the top scorer. Ultimately, though, silverware carries more allure than golden boots.</p> <p>\"I don't have a personal target,\" said Adebayor. \"My target is to win the championship with this club. I love this club and they have given me a lot. I want to win a trophy to thank all the fans and everyone for getting me to where I am today.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Americans call it a Hail Mary, the last ditch moment in American football when the quarterback makes a desperate forward pass in the hope he can snatch victory. Normally the tactic fails, but in Gordon Brown's case the throw looks for the moment as if it could yet save him. </p> <p>Only three weeks ago he looked like a doomed man about to lose either the next election or the party leadership. </p> <p>He seemed unable to carry out a reshuffle, and there was the grotesque chaos of a drunken 3am briefing in a conference hotel over Ruth Kelly's decision to leave the cabinet. Obituaries were being prepared for the least successful prime minister in British history. </p> <p>Now Brown has suddenly managed to grab the worldwide banking crisis and turn it to his political advantage. It has left the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives gasping for the oxygen of publicity, desperately trying to look relevant as share prices gyrated, banks crashed and the impossible rapidly became the inevitable. For Cameron, it has been an especially bitter pill. He has projected himself as the Little Miss Sunshine of politics, hardly the personality you require for the age of austerity, and his big theme of a broken society was predicated on morality trumping economics as the great issue of our time. He and George Osborne had prepared to make their conference an all-out assault on spiralling public debt, only to find it was a personal debt-fuelled bubble that had become the issue. </p> <p>The lucky stroke for Brown was his long planned visit to New York. The trip was originally to focus on Africa, and a drive to regalvanise the UN millennium development goals. </p> <p>But if Brown and his entourage had come to New York to save the world's poor, the trip rapidly became an attempt to rescue the world's rich.</p> <p>At an increasingly informal briefing at Wollensky's steakhouse in Manhattan, the prime minister's spokesman admitted the trip's focus was shifting. </p> <p>The next day Brown pulled off the coup of a hastily arranged meeting with President Bush George in the Oval Office. Bush was in the midst of his efforts to arm-twist Republicans into backing the Paulson bail-out plan. Not surprisingly the president looked drawn, with papers marked top secret strewn on his desk, as he wrongly assured Brown the $700bn bail-out would go through Congress. Significantly, the only minister with Brown in the White House that afternoon was Lady Vadera, his business adviser. </p> <p>The meeting went on longer than planned so Brown missed the 10 o'clock News, but the bigger message got out - Brown, \"the rock of stability\", was at the epicentre of the crisis. </p> <p>On the plane home, he was in his element, advising reporters on the scale of the crisis and his campaign for stronger international regulation. All the while, as the plane crossed the Atlantic, he knew Bradford &amp; Bingley was quietly going bust, yet he was focused. Like the FTSE, Brown's shares now seem on an upward curve. </p> <p>He will carry out a limited reshuffle tomorrow, and the threatened revolt by MPs at next week's meeting of the parliamentary Labour party has vanished.</p> <p>Brown, though, is still in what he describes as dangerous waters. A run on the banks is still the great unmentionable, and as Cameron has said, \"the political day of reckoning\" is yet to come. He will have to defend his regulatory structure from the kind of assaults the Democrats ironically are raining down on Bush. </p> <p>Europeans, including President Nicolas Sarkozy, are preparing to blame Anglo-Saxon economics for the crash, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in a little reported speech, singled out Britain for blocking her efforts to control hedge funds and credit rating agencies, a charge Brown denies. </p> <p>If Britain escapes without a run on savings, Brown can see a path ahead. He hopes food and oil prices will decline by the middle of 2009, making it possible to ease interest rates. </p> <p>For the moment, it is a case of the worse the economy, the better for him. He is back in the game.</p>",
  "<h2>Renew or replace?</h2> <p>My four year-old Evesham Axis 64 MKR PC generally works fine. However, I guess that components such as the hard disk and power supply must be reaching the end of their reliable lives. I am keen to avoid a loss of data or of service. What approach to renewal would offer a good balance of the pragmatic and the sustainable? <br><strong>Paul Martin </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The Axis 64 MKR was a good machine in its day, had a good graphics card, and it seems its 2.2GHz AMD Athlon 64 3500+ processor still does all you need. However, it's worth upgrading from 512MB of memory to at least 1GB, and you should really have done this sooner rather than later. Hard drives fail, but running a drive checker such as HDD Health (<a href=\"http://www.panterasoft.com\">panterasoft.com</a>) will monitor its performance and predict how long it will last. (It expects my hard drive to last until 2017.) You should already have all your data backed up to CD or DVD, but you can also buy an external USB hard drive and \"ghost\" a complete backup of your system using Acronis True Image or similar software. This would soon get you up and running again after a drive failure. The extra RAM should keep your Axis going for another couple of years, and the cost of the external drive would not be wasted because you'll still be able to use it when you buy a new PC. However, if HDD Health detects hard drive problems, it would be worth replacing it with a bigger, faster drive, and it might be worth considering a new PC.</p> <h2>More space, please</h2> <p>I have a 2003 computer. I now want to increase my hard disk space from its current 80GB (with 80GB external disk backup) to 500GB (similarly backed up) to cope with the large number of RAW photographs I am now producing. I have discovered that this is not as simple as just buying a new hard drive and sticking it in. Would it be best just to buy a new computer?<br><strong>John Ward</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Nowadays, thanks to autoconfiguration routines, adding a second hard drive as a slave is almost as simple as just buying a new hard drive and sticking it in. A quick Google will find lots of guides and even YouTube videos to help. At worst, you might have to find Windows' Disk Management utility - go to the Control Panel's Administrative Tools folder, select Computer Management, then click Disk Management - to set up the drive. It's probably not worth buying a new PC unless you need the extra power to edit copies of large RAW files, which can be a strain on old PCs. It often is worth buying a new PC to get improvements in two or more areas, such as for example if you need more memory, more hard drive space, more memory, a faster processor etc.</p> <h2>Fake security attack</h2> <p>I am being plagued by a full-page message that pops up when I am browsing. It warns of \"Insecure Internet activity. Threat of virus attack\" and says \"Click here to get full advanced real-time protection and continue browsing\". Needless to say, I don't trust this, and have not downloaded anything - at least as far as I know.<br><strong>Glyn Collins </strong></p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Putting up fake spyware or antivirus alerts, and making them look the same as Microsoft Windows alerts, seems to be the latest fashion. From the full message, the fake antivirus software in this case is KvmSecure, which is a nasty Trojan. You may just have a minor adware problem. However, if you have the Trojan, you may need to use a strong removal tool such as Malwarebytes: Beeping Computer has instructions (<a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/malware-removal/kvmsecure\">bleepingcomputer.com/malware-removal/kvmsecure</a>). Remember to back up essential data first, and change important passwords afterwards.</p> <h2>Annoying Security Center</h2> <p>We don't want Windows Security Center to keep popping up on our screen, but as complete novices have no idea how to stop it. We already use McAfee.<br><strong>Dave Davies</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The Windows Security Center in Windows XP SP2 and Vista monitors four areas: Firewall, Automatic Updating, Malware Protection and Other Security Settings. It doesn't usually pop up unless you are operating your PC in an insecure manner, or the alternative software that you have installed is sending it incorrect notifications. However, you can turn off the alerts from the Security Center. Simply click where it says \"Change the way Security Center alerts me\" in the left-hand pane. If you can't run WSC from the SysTray, go to Control Panel and select Security Center, or go to the Start menu's System Tools folder, or in Vista, start typing Security in the Start menu search box. Bear in mind that if you disable Windows Security Center, you will be making your PC less secure. </p> <h2>A strange icon</h2> <p>An icon looking like a notebook has appeared from nowhere on my desktop. It has GEAREXT underneath. Should I be worried? <br><strong>Glenda Wellum</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> You can right-click on the icon and select Properties: that should tell you something about it. You can also right-click, select \"Open with\" and open it in Notepad. (This will work whether it's a text file or not.) If you find it contains a list of CDs that you have burned, then it's a log file from one of Gear Software's DVD and CD burning programs (<a href=\"http://www.gearsoftware.com\">gearsoftware.com</a>).</p> <h2>Backchat</h2> <p>\u2022 Nick Fisher wanted a printer for Linux.

  "<p>The Palace of Westminster and the Bank of England have been exposed as among the country's least energy efficient public buildings by a new law to measure carbon dioxide emissions from the national estate.</p> <p>Around 18,000 buildings, including town halls, museums, schools and job centres, are being tested to discover their energy efficiency on a sliding scale where A is the best and G is the worst. Parliament and the Bank both scored a G. Together, they consume enough electricity and gas to pump out 21,356 tonnes of CO2 a year, the equivalent of more than 14,000 people flying from London to New York.</p> <p>New buildings also fared badly, raising questions about the validity of sustainability claims made by architects and developers. London's City Hall scored E despite opening in 2002 and being described by its architect Foster &amp; Partners as a \"virtually non-polluting public building\". The Treasury's headquarters on Horse Guards Parade scored the same despite a complete office refurbishment six years ago that was supposed to \"set new environmental standards in Whitehall\". </p> <p>In Manchester, the Imperial War Museum North, designed by Daniel Libeskind and opened in 2002, scored a G, the same as its 91-year-old sister museum in London.</p> <p>The government estimates that almost a fifth of all carbon dioxide emissions in the UK are caused by non-residential buildings, and environmental campaigners said the findings mean the government must launch an urgent refurbishment programme to slash carbon emissions.</p> <p>The Natural History Museum spends \u00a31.4m a year on electricity and gas - a figure that is expected to double from this month as a result of rising world energy prices. One of the most energy hungry buildings in the country was the National Media Museum in Bradford, a 1960s structure, which scored a G. One in four of the 3,200 buildings assessed so far scored F or G, and the average was D. Only 22 buildings - under 1% - scored A. </p> <p>\"These results show our leaky and draughty public buildings should be a priority target for refurbishment,\" said Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Buildings Council. \"In a turbulent financial climate, lower energy bills will benefit the taxpayer for years to come. If we are to cut our carbon, save money and achieve energy security, our buildings have to be on the front line of this battle.\"</p> <p>\"We review 350 significant new build projects a year at design stage and we hear a lot of greenwash,\" said Matt Bell, director of public affairs at the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, the government's architecture watchdog. \"The knowledge that from now on this performance will be objectively measured should mark the end of that.\"</p> <p>The findings emerged yesterday as it became law for any public building larger than 1,000 square metres to show a display energy certificate (DEC). The system is similar to the colour coded labels which show carbon emissions caused by refrigerators and cars. On that basis, the Bank and parliament are the building equivalent of a petrol-hungry Land Rover Discovery.</p> <p>No 10 Downing Street managed a D rating, which is better than average for its building type. But the prime minister's heating, lighting and air conditioning still create 675 tonnes of CO2 a year, a bigger carbon footprint than a street of 28 families of four living in semi detached homes, each driving 10,000 miles a year and flying to Spain on an annual holiday.</p> <p>The findings are likely to embarrass the government, which has pledged to make all new public buildings zero carbon by 2018. The Department for the Environment's head office recorded an E. </p> <p>Forty-three per cent of 374 jobcentres scored E or lower. Eland House, the 10- year-old head office of the Department for Communities and Local Government, which has overseen the DEC system, scored an F.</p> <p>Building occupiers can be fined up to \u00a31,500 if they fail to display the certificate and report on how efficiency might be improved. The Welsh Assembly, built to supposedly environmentally friendly designs by the architect Lord Rogers, is one of many occupiers which could face the fine after they missed the deadline and failed to put certificates up.</p> <p>Buildings that performed well included a Jobcentre Plus office in Goole in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which received a B after lighting movement sensors were installed, a policy of turning off all computer monitors at night was introduced and timers were fitted to heating boilers.</p> <p>\"There are cheap measures which can be carried out to reduce most energy bills in these kinds of buildings by 20% quite quickly,\" said Jacqueline Balian, director of information for the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers, whose members have carried out around two thirds of the DECs. \"Common problems are chillers and boilers running at the same time and leaving boilers on all night. This system of DECs should make the management of energy used by buildings much more high profile.\"</p> <p>Iain Wright, the housing minister, who is responsible for the certification programme, said: \"Display energy certificates are a valuable tool in the fight against climate change.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 4 2008. There were two errors in an article above about the energy efficiency of public buildings. The Imperial War Museum North is in Trafford Park, Manchester, not Salford. Goole is in the East Riding of Yorkshire, not Humberside. The county of Humberside was abolished in 1996. These errors have been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>A search is under way for a Briton who is presumed to have been grabbed and eaten by a 5.5 metre (18ft) crocodile while inspecting crab pots in the Australian outback in a notorious area called Cape Crocodile.</p> <p>Arthur Booker, a 62-year-old Vietnam veteran who was born in Banffshire, Scotland, but now lives in Logan, near Brisbane, was last seen by his wife, Doris, before he went to retrieve his crab pots on Tuesday morning from a riverbank in Cooktown, north Queensland, while the couple were on a two-day camping holiday. His wife, who was waiting in the car, raised the alarm when he failed to return two hours after setting out at 8.30am. </p> <p>A large male crocodile called Charlie, which has been microchipped for monitoring by conservationists, is the main suspect.</p> <p>Booker's camera was found on the bank, there were skid marks from what appear to be crocodile feet and a rope holding the crab pots was frayed rather than cut, according to local police. His wristwatch and two sandals were later recovered.</p> <p>Duncan Faichney, who has fished in the area for 40 years, said: \"You would never get me in the water around here. There's crocodile all around. You don't go near them and they won't eat you - that's the deal.\"</p> <p>James Newman, regional manager of Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, said two large crocodiles had been seen nearby.</p> <p>The last fatal crocodile attack in the area was in 2005 when Barry Jefferies was grabbed by the arm and dragged out of his canoe. Ten months earlier, Alicia Sorohan jumped on the back of a crocodile to save a fellow camper. The grandmother earned a national heroism award and became known as Granny Dundee after the Australian movie character.</p> <p>A Queensland University crocodile expert, Craig Franklin, said crocodiles were ambush predators on the lookout for repeated patterns of activity from potential prey. They do not specifically target humans but they are opportunistic feeders. </p> <p>Russell Bowman, owner of The Lure Shop in Cooktown, said he believed Booker had made the fatal mistake of returning to the same location twice, having set his crab pot and returning to retrieve it from the water.</p> <p>\"We've all seen the documentaries where there's those lightning-fast takes out of the water,\" Bowman added. \"It's one of the basic rules you apply - don't form habits.\" </p> <p>Local residents say that since shooting of crocodiles stopped in 1974, attacks on humans have been on the increase.</p>",
  "<p>The cover of Nitin Sawhney's new album, London Undersound, shows a man emerging ghost-like from what looks like an underground tunnel. This is Antony Gormley's interpretation of the record's strongest track, Days of Fire, a first-hand account by the singer Natty of witnessing the July 2005 bombings in London. He was a few metres away from the number 30 bus when it exploded in Tavistock Square; a few weeks later, he was on the same tube train as Jean Charles de Menezes when he was shot dead by police. </p> <p>Get Sawhney on this subject and he grows angry, the words flowing thick and fast. London has been his adopted home since he dropped out of a law course at Liverpool University. The album is about the capital, he says, \"and what I feel about London, in the wake of 7/7. It's been a strange rollercoaster since 9/11, in terms of the atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Seeing the erosion of civil liberties, cameras on every street corner, and what we're willing to accept. Jean Charles de Menezes - a public execution, which no one was held accountable for.\" </p> <p>This anger comes through in London Undersound, Sawhney's eighth album in a career that has taken him from 2000's Mercury Music prize-nominated Beyond Skin to scores for more than 40 films and video games, as well as collaborations with Gormley and the choreographer Akram Khan (2005's Zero Degrees); and the theatre company Complicite (A Disappearing Number). There's a dub-flavoured track about feeling afraid to travel alone on the tube late at night; a powerful song asserting that \"we're in this together\" - recorded, Sawhney explains, according to \"a ritual\" that took him and the singer Imogen Heap to each of the four corners of the city, from east London's Billingsgate fish market to the western suburb of Southall. Sawhney says he feels frustrated when he hears people say that music and politics should never mix: \"The bands I admired when I was growing up ... challenged authority, whether it was Public Enemy, NWA, the South African jazz scene, and John Lennon. Music shouldn't be afraid.\" </p> <p>One of the people Sawhney approached as a potential collaborator on the album was Paul McCartney; the result is the saccharine ballad My Soul, the lyrics to which - \"I long to know all your secrets/ I want to walk through your fire\" - eulogise, some newspapers have suggested, McCartney's relationship with Heather Mills. Sawhney stops short of confirming this. \"Every day I was reading about Paul and the paparazzi,\" he says. \"So I thought, 'Why don't I just phone him up and say, do you want to write about how you feel about what's going on?' And he just said, 'Yeah, that would be wicked.' So he came over and just hung out at the house.\" Sawhney laughs, as if unable to believe his luck. </p> <p>Sawhney's last two albums, 2005's Philtre and 2003's Human, felt more personal than political, reflecting on his own family and upbringing. He was born in Rochester, Kent, in 1964; his father, a biochemist, and his mother, an Indian classical dancer, had come to England from the Punjab the year before, and Sawhney grew up one of three brothers, the only Asian boys in their comprehensive school. The themes of identity and immigration, war and peace, are rarely far from his music's heart. Beyond Skin opens with the Indian prime minister talking about nuclear tests in 1998, and ends with Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the nuclear bomb, quoting from the sacred Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita: \"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\"</p> <p>It's Sawhney's interest in what makes us human that makes him nervous around the labels \"fusion\" and \"world music\", both of which he thinks frustrate rather than promote understanding. \"Everything that we are, that we think, that we feel - comes from one,\" he says. \"So 'fusion' for me is a problem. It's the idea that we are all separate, and I have always thought of looking for commonality. That's what I get a kick out of.\" </p> <p>The next few months remain busy for Sawhney. He's working on scores for four films - among them a Portuguese-language film about de Menezes; and One Day On Earth, a documentary about climate change. There's a mooted collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra; three hours of orchestration for another video game (Sawhney's last, Heavenly Sword for Sony PlayStation 3, proved a hit); a DJing session for the Singapore Grand Prix; and, last but not least, a European concert tour. No wonder that Sawhney's work ethic has seen him described in his website biography as a \"latter-day Renaissance man\". Is this how he sees himself?</p> <p>Sawhney is uncharacteristically lost for words. \"Erm ... I just see myself as trying to make music. I like working with lots of different art forms, as well as other musicians. But you know the Renaissance focused on humanism, and actually came from diversity, because of what happened in Florence, with the influx of people with new ideas. It was a re-awakening. So if somebody thinks I'm part of that way of thinking, that's a good thing\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>London Undersound</strong> is released on October 13 on Positiv-Id. Sawhney plays the Roundhouse, London (0844 482 8008), on October 24. Then touring.</p>",

The news was all about the nation's youths shooting and knifing each other to death, and for nothing really: turning into the wrong street, looking at each other the wrong way, simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p> <p>This is still going on, it's just that we don't care any more because we're now more concerned about our savings and our buy-to-let mortgages (or bye-bye-to-let mortgages as they're now known). </p> <p>TV drama takes a little while to make, so this<strong> Silent Witness</strong> (BBC1), about hoodlum hoodies, looks like an effort to engage with the real world, and that should be applauded. It's even up to scratch with the vernacular (like I know!). The first two-parter in the series - series 12, can you believe it? - is called Safe. That, of course, is not safe as in safe as houses or safe sex, but safe as in the modern meaning of the word, ie good. Although, because anyone who uses the word in this way is almost certainly not at all good, it can be understood by the rest of us to mean bad - which incidentally used to mean good, even before wicked meant good, but hasn't for a long time. Do you see? </p> <p>\"Shagging\" is maybe a simpler example. These kids are all constantly shagging each other, which means they're sticking knives and firing bullets into each other, not having sex (though they are almost certainly doing that, too - and this is highly unlikely to be what you and I would describe as safe sex, because safe sex, to them, is not at all safe, if you see what I mean). </p> <p>Dr Nikki Alexander, meanwhile, is shagging the handsome ambulance man, but fortunately for him - very fortunately for him - only in the old-fashioned sense of the word. Incidentally, I've never been totally convinced by Emilia Fox - I mean she's fantastic and beautiful and I'm absolutely in love with her, obviously; but I just don't believe in her as a senior home office pathologist, as I did Amanda Burton. Burton had more gravitas.</p> <p>Anyway, Dr Alexander's boss, Professor Leo Dalton (Britain's answer to CSI's Gil Grissom), is having to do community service after being caught drink-driving. I like that - you wouldn't catch Grissom drink-driving. CSI may have the glitz and glamour, but Silent Witness does the grit. Flawed crime-solvers, that's what we have over here. </p> <p>So, during his community service on some rough old estate in London, Leo gets to run with all these kids. And then he witnesses a shagging, right in front of him on the football field. </p> <p>Actually, I don't know if it counts as a shagging, as young Errol doesn't die (yet), because Leo saves him. But then another kid, Itchy Ritchie, gets properly shagged, four bullets - thud, thud, thud, thud - in the chest, at a basketball gym. Videoed on a mobile phone, too (happy shagging?). And it turns out all this is connected to a body they've got on the slab back at the lab (quite a coincidence, I know, but it's fiction). There's something extra naked about a naked body on a pathologist's slab.</p> <p>We're treated to two postmortems in this one. Itchy Ritchie actually has his brain sliced up (quite thick slices) so we can see the evidence of foetal alcohol syndrome in his frontal cortex first-hand. It's there to see on his palm, too - though I don't think the phrase \"simian crease\" is acceptable any more, is it? Come on Dr Nikki, get with the times. Still, poor Itchy Ritchie. He was a victim before he was even born. </p> <p>There are loads of Real Issues in here: drinking in pregnancy, absent fathers, respect and disrespect, mistrust of the police, the police simply not getting it, gangs, desensitised youth, drugs, gun and knife-crime. But this is not some kind of worthy message thinly disguised as drama. It is, first and foremost, drama. Cracking drama, too (with the odd, forgivable loopiness), that simply engages with the real world. I'm itching - sorry Ritchie - for part two.</p> <p>And for series 13, they can tackle the credit crunch - Dr Nikki, Dr Harry and Prof Leo carving up emaciated bodies on their cold slab. Stomach completely empty, hasn't eaten for weeks, another death by poverty ...</p>",
  "<p>A report on cannabis prepared for next year's UN drug policy review will suggest that a \"regulated market\" would cause less harm than the current international prohibition. The report, which is likely to reopen the debate about cannabis laws, suggests that controls such as taxation, minimum age requirements and labelling could be explored.</p> <p>The Global Cannabis Commission report, which will be launched today at a conference in the House of Lords, has reached conclusions which its authors suggest \"challenge the received wisdom concerning cannabis\". It was carried out for the Beckley foundation, a UN-accredited NGO, for the 2009 UN strategic drug policy review. </p> <p>There are, according to the report, now more than 160 million users of the drug worldwide. \"Although cannabis can have a negative impact on health, including mental health, in terms of relative harms it is considerably less harmful than alcohol or tobacco,\" according to the report. \"Historically, there have only been two deaths worldwide attributed to cannabis, whereas alcohol and tobacco together are responsible for an estimated 150,000 deaths per annum in the UK alone.\"</p> <p>The report, compiled by a group of scientists, academics and drug policy experts, suggests that much of the harm associated with cannabis use is \"the result of prohibition itself, particularly the social harms arising from arrest and imprisonment.\" Policies that control cannabis, whether draconian or liberal, appear to have little impact on the prevalence of consumption, it concluded. </p> <p>\"In an alternative system of regulated availability, market controls such as taxation, minimum age requirements, labelling and potency limits are available to minimise the harms associated with cannabis use,\" said the report. </p> <p>It claimed that only through a regulated market could young people be protected from the increasingly potent forms of cannabis, such as skunk. It is intended that the report will form a blueprint for nations seeking to develop a \"more rational and effective approach to the control of cannabis\".</p> <p>The authors suggest there is evidence that \"the current system of cannabis regulation is not working, and ... there needs to be a serious rethink if we are to minimise the harms caused by cannabis use.\"</p> <p>Last night, the report was welcomed by drug law reform organisations. \"The Beckley foundation are to be congratulated for the clarity of their call for cannabis supply to be brought within government control,\" said Danny Kushlick of Transform. \"We look forward to the same analysis being applied to heroin and cocaine.\"</p> <p>The report is being launched at a two-day conference, which will be attended by leading figures in the drugs policy world. </p> <p>The conclusions are unlikely to be embraced by the government or the Conservative party, both of which are opposed to relaxing restrictions on cannabis use.</p>",
  "<p>As the convulsions in the global financial system grind on, political certainties continue to dissolve and what last week seemed outlandish becomes today's common sense. Across the western world, politicians are struggling to keep up, but none more so than the British Conservatives, whose leaders have repeatedly had to tear up their scripts since the opening of the party's annual conference in Birmingham at the weekend.</p> <p>Like the US presidential candidate John McCain, they have tacked and hedged under the weight of events: from outright opposition to bank nationalisations earlier this year to now quietly accepting them; from defending speculative short-selling last month as \"a function of capitalist markets\" to meekly signing up to a ban; and from David Cameron's insistence at the weekend that there would be no \"cheap lines bashing financiers\", to Tuesday's declaration that it was \"easy to see why people are so angry with the bankers\" and yesterday's promise that there would be a \"day of reckoning\" - though, following St Augustine, not yet.</p> <p>The same goes for George Osborne's party-sweetening pledge of a two-year council tax freeze, which showed every sign of having been cobbled together before last month's Wall Street seizure and already seemed to be coming unstuck yesterday as councils across the country insisted they would not participate in a scheme to cut essential services during a recession.</p> <p>Gordon Brown has of course been able to finesse his own repositioning - from \"light-touch regulation\" to \"whatever it takes\" intervention - under cover of a blizzard of poll-boosting prime ministerial activity. But no such option is available to Cameron. So having offered his entirely unnecessary cooperation with government action to tame the markets, the Tory leader yesterday used his conference speech to focus on anything and everything but the crisis engulfing the Anglo-American capitalist model he unequivocally supports: his own character and judgment, the mirage of governmental experience, the \"infection\" of the \"health and safety, human rights culture\" and the eternal Tory verities of responsibility, \"low taxes and sound money\".</p> <p>When he did touch on the economic crisis, it was only to blame the level of government borrowing and the removal of responsibility for financial regulation from the Bank of England - neither of which can seriously be regarded as a cause of the meltdown in the markets. </p> <p>Of course when Osborne ridicules New Labour's \"fawning\" on big money and attacks the government for a boom built on housing and credit-fuelled debt, he draws blood - even if his claim that Britain's budget deficit is \"larger than any in the developed world\" is not actually true, as Henry Paulson could advise him. But as the week has gone on, it has become ever clearer that the Tories have little sensible to say about the crisis and nothing to propose to overcome it.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why. New Labour enthusiastically climbed on the bandwagon of deregulated markets in the 1990s, but it was the Conservatives who unleashed them in the 1980s. And for all their talk of \"casino capitalism\", Cameron's Tories are hamstrung ideologically, financially - including by their own hedge-fund donors - and by their recent history, from demanding the necessary action to bring private finance to heel. </p> <p>Like Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley was privatised, or \"demutualised\", as a result of Thatcherite deregulation, and its reckless expansion and collapse could not have happened without it. What can Cameron usefully say about that? So he fell back yesterday on proposals to cut corporation tax and demands for a smaller state at exactly the time when only large-scale state intervention stands between us and the implosion of the entire financial system.</p> <p>As a result, the Tories are now irrelevant to the crisis in Britain, while in the US popular pressure from both left and right at least temporarily blocked the something-for-nothing Paulson bail-out plan for a takeover of bad debts without the necessary public equity stakes, recapitalisation and democratic control to turn the banking sector round - let alone a clampdown on toxic executive pay largesse or support for the those now being turfed out of their homes. </p> <p>The Senate was last night preparing to vote on the scheme, which looks certain neither to fix the problem nor make those responsible bear the costs. The same would apply to any comparable rescue the government might be tempted to mount in Britain. At every stage of the credit crisis, Brown has strained to avoid any challenge to the neoliberal principles New Labour was built on, notably delaying the nationalisation of Northern Rock for months while fruitless attempts were made to find a private sector buyer.</p> <p>Even the past fortnight's more effective interventions, in the sale of HBOS and the takeover of Bradford &amp; Bingley, have sought at every turn to minimise any lasting public sector role. In the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley, the profitable parts have already been sold, in classic lame-duck nationalisation tradition, to the Spanish bank Santander. But the scope for these piecemeal interventions may be coming to an end. In particular, if the HBOS deal, the last rampart of a private solution, were to unravel, there is already speculation that wholesale nationalisation of banks could become unavoidable. </p> <p>The case for wider public ownership in the financial sector is in any case growing stronger with every twist of the crisis and every failure of regulation. The private sector has repeatedly and now disastrously shown itself unable to run the financial system without devastating collateral damage. And if banks are considered too important to the wider economy to go under, they cannot be considered part of a competitive market system.</p> <p>Such radical solutions would only arise out of dire necessity. But the longer the crisis continues, the more they will be raised - and when a US Republican treasury secretary comes up with a $700bn bank rescue package, the potential of what governments can do with political will is thrown into unusually sharp relief. No wonder Cameron has been warning that the crisis risks leading the left to turn its back on free-market economics. In reality, the battle has been won over the necessity of intervention. The argument is now over what form it takes - and who benefits.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Pity the residents of what New Labour politicians think of as the strong and joyful ecotowns, one of which might yet blight a stretch of landscape near you by 2020. Not only will they have to live in developer-built dormitory suburbs given a fashionable name, they will also be the subject of unprecedented scrutiny by quango folk who, in a holier-than-thou spirit, will check on just how \"eco\" ecotown folk will be. </p> <p>Thermographic cameras will be used to check which homes lose heat, says Cabe, the government's ever-expanding Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. Will Cabe wardens be sent to patrol ecotown cul-de-sacs squealing \"Shut that door\" and \"Put that bloody tungsten light out\"? </p> <p>This busybody quango also plans to monitor the ecological footprint of the diet of 100 randomly selected residents, as well as calculating C02 emissions from transport within any given ecotown. </p> <p>Ecotownies partial to lamb cutlets and to cream on their strawberries might yet be watched as closely as al-Qaida suspects. Retailers in these housing gulags, says Cabe, should provide plenty of products with a low meat and dairy content in line with studies showing that a significant reduction in animal product meals could cut the ecological footprint of food by 60%. \"Consumer goods\", adds Cabe, \"account for 14% of an individual's ecological footprint and the target should be to halve the impact from this\". We will have to wait and see whether ecotownies will be deterred from eating HobNobs, hummus, imported haricot beans, or all three.</p> <p>If the silly season was still in full swing, such tomfoolery would be funny. Disturbingly, this nosy-parker nonsense really does appear to inform thinking underpinning Labour's sorry ecotown project. Perhaps ecotown children can be encouraged to report wayward parents to ascetic Cabe commissioners as these guardians of environmental law cycle past. \"I caught my dad eating steak and oven-ready chips.\" Doubtless, one of New Labour's \"titan\" jails will provide \"porridge\" to such miscreants. Cabe insists that it's not trying to play a Big Brother role and simply wants to collect useful information about \"eco towns\", but it comes across as a bully boy body.</p> <p>Not only is this kind of policing fundamentally against the spirit of British town life, it is also wrong-headed and even hypocritical. </p> <p>It is wrong-headed for at least two simple reasons. First, it would be unjust to single out one set of townspeople for such petty prying. If ours is to be a land of snoops, then let us all suffer such indignities and, in doing so, learn to fight back with common sense and common decency. Second, every small town used to be an \"ecotown\". We do not need special ecotowns and their inquisitions. Instead, we need to spur ourselves into living greener lives in existing towns. Crank down the heating and wear a jumper when it gets cold. Build new homes in existing towns and villages. Open farmers' markets rather than plot yet more supermarkets.</p> <p>Cabe, meanwhile, sees no gap in the logic of, on the one hand, promoting ecotowns and, on the other, of gleefully encouraging new supermarkets in old towns. In my own small Suffolk town, Hadleigh, Cabe has \"congratulated\" Tesco and the district council for a proposal to build a banal supermarket, with greater floor space than the whole of the existing, chain-free high street, on a much-loved watermeadow long given over to allotments. If this plan were to be given the go-ahead, the town's carbon emission, and traffic, will rise to unhappy and unjustified levels, while local food suppliers and sellers will be eased out of business. </p> <p>Even as this government and its pointy-headed minions lecture us on \"sustainability\" and plan their patronising and illiberal ecotowns, they undermine existing settlements that, unknown to meat and dairy snoops, and, innocent of thermographic cameras, are far \"greener\" - unspoilt and free of government and quango interference - than \"blue sky\" towns planned by wonkish thinking and bullying edict.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com\">jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Now Or Later is the story of a political scandal breaking. Somebody posts pictures on the internet of the President-elect's son dressed up as the Prophet Muhammad.

The warrant stated that he had committed the offences in \"Australia, Germany and other countries\". </p> <p>T\u00f6ben appeared before Westminster magistrates court, where prosecutor Tina Whybraw said that when police boarded the plane T\u00f6ben was seen to move seat to avoid detection and told officers that \"you can't arrest me on British soil\". </p> <p>The court failed to establish whether he had served the sentence in Germany or had absconded before he could be imprisoned.</p> <p>District judge Nicholas Evans remanded T\u00f6ben in custody until tomorrow, when he will appear again. Before he was taken out of court T\u00f6ben replied: \"It's a done deal between Britain and Germany. This is an insult. I'm a teacher.\"</p> <p>T\u00f6ben is already awaiting the outcome of a court case in southern Australia where his privately funded Adelaide Institute is accused of publishing antisemitic material and opposing the historical truth about the Holocaust.</p> <p>Last year, T\u00f6ben said he had been allowed to visit London to see his son. On another occasion he had been stopped in Helsinki but was permitted to travel on to Russia to attend a conference. He is alleged to have attended a recent international conference in Iran that questioned the historical accuracy of Nazi war crimes against Jews. </p> <p>In a 2005 interview with Iranian state television he said: \"The Holocaust equals a lie. Therefore Israel is built on a lie.\"</p> <p>Wearing a black suit and peering over reading glasses, T\u00f6ben addressed the court from behind a glass screen yesterday. He did not deny who he was. </p> <p>\"Dr T\u00f6ben has been caught in London,\" he said. </p> <p>He objected to the terms of the warrant, claimed that Britain should not be able to hand him over because it was not in the Schengen agreement and said he had been slandered for his views. </p> <p>He said he was on a research trip to South Africa, where he was hoping to interview a descendant of Napoleon about whom he was planning to write a book.</p> <p>\"Jewish groups in Australia,\" he said, were \"trying to close down the Adelaide Institute website.\"</p> <p>He said he had sought permission from the court in Australia before leaving the country.</p> <p>\"This is an abuse of process. This is a legal ambush. It's not British law where the individual still has freedoms,\" he told the court. </p> <p>\"It's a witch-trial mentality in Germany concerning this matter. I was under the impression that if I transited [the UK] I would be fine. There was no reason for me to suspect that anything should happen to me. </p> <p>\"The Schengen agreement protected me.

  "<p>The financial crisis may be dominating the US presidential campaign, but the season's most intriguing political battle is shaping up as a straightforward fight for survival between two old foes: Sarah Palin and the polar bear. When the US government decided to classify Ursus maritimus as an endangered species earlier in the year, Palin sued in attempt to overturn the ruling, fearing the label would deter oil and gas exploration in Alaska. The case of Palin v Polar bear will be heard in January. Here's how the contenders size up: <br><strong><br>Range</strong><br>Polar bear: Found across the Arctic regions of five countries; the US, Canada, Russia, Norway and Greenland. <br>Sarah Palin: Not quite as well travelled. Lives within sight of Russia, but has never ventured there, possibly because of diminishing sea ice. </p> <p><strong>Conservation status</strong><br>Polar bear: Vulnerable, largely due to climatic change and the resulting habitat loss. <br>Palin: Also vulnerable, because of a lack of experience and controversial stances on abortion, creationism, global warming, same-sex marriage and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Predatory armoury</strong><br>Polar bear: Possesses razor-sharp teeth, a powerful build and a sense of smell that can detect a seal a mile away under three feet of snow. Still unlikely to triumph in a direct confrontation with Palin however, unless the Alaska legislature suddenly decides to uphold the right to arm bears. <br>Palin: Licensed gun-owner, avid hunter and crack shot. Palin also supports a policy of shooting wolves from helicopters in order to increase the Alaskan moose population so that Alaskans can shoot more moose. Deadly. </p> <p><strong>Impact of climate change</strong><br>Polar bear: Length of hunting season has diminished, birth rates have fallen and it now has insufficient fat reserves. <br>Palin: None observed.</p> <p><strong>Biggest supporters</strong><br>Polar bear: Greenpeace, the US department of the interior, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey.<br>Palin: Hockey moms, the National Rifle Association, rightwing fundamentalist Christians, climate change deniers, the oil industry, God (endorsement unconfirmed). </p> <p><strong>Biggest threat to survival </strong><br>Polar bear: Sarah Palin. <br>Palin: Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, feminism, belated national reality check brought on by global economic crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Ofsted claims many pupils are being offered school trips as a \"treat\" for sitting their Sats exams rather than as an opportunity to widen their learning, and that other children miss out on visits altogether because of the expense.</p> <p>The paperwork associated with trips sometimes deters teachers from organising visits, and headteachers have not been convinced by the government that they should make visits a priority. Only a small minority had heard of the ministerial drive to promote trips, Ofsted found. </p> <p>Ed Balls, the schools secretary, said school trips should not be an add-on to education but an integral part of it. He is launching today a \u00a34.5m plan to cut bureaucracy and introduce a \"quality badge\" to kitemark trips to ensure their safety. </p> <p>The Ofsted report, based on visits to 27 schools that had been judged outstanding, found that even some of the best secondaries felt too constrained by the curriculum to take learning beyond the classroom. In high-performing primary schools, trips were popular with pupils but often failed to connect with their lessons. </p> <p>The report lists the multiple benefits of school trips, which include improvements to personal and social skills and academic achievement, and the chance to increase understanding of subjects. </p> <p>The report says children \"universally\" described enjoying such outings, ranging from museum visits to field trips. But it warns that pupils seemed to have spent too much time travelling or in venues' shops, and not enough time learning.</p> <p>Many primaries offer pupils residential trips when they are 11 as a reward after their Sats and before they go to secondary school, but this means trips are not part of the curriculum or an aid to learning, Ofsted said. A jump in demand for trips in the summer term also forced up prices. </p> <p>Christine Gilbert, Ofsted's chief inspector, said: \"The positive impact of learning outside the classroom is widely recognised, but unfortunately it is sometimes seen as an extra or a treat, rather than as an integral part of the curriculum.\"</p> <p>The cost of trips also put some schools off, the report found. By law, schools cannot charge for trips but can ask for contributions and suggest to parents that visits might not happen if the money is short. School trips are \"rarely free\", the report notes. \"The schools visited saw this as a barrier to extending such work because they were reluctant to ask parents to contribute too much too often.\"</p> <p>The schools secretary is today launching an Out and About package to encourage school trips. A new website will provide advice, resources and training modules to support learning outside the classroom. A safety kitemark for activity centres will follow in the new year. </p> <p>Balls said: \"It is wrong to wrap children in cotton wool as they grow up. Trips and getting out of the classroom should be part and parcel of school life and always give the most vivid childhood memories. Learning outside class is not some optional extra. It should excite young people, deepen their understanding of subjects and [is] vital - to make young people independent, confident and self reliant.\"</p> <p>Parent groups, however, have complained that there are too many overseas trips for children. Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, said: \"Perhaps if we need to look at ... reducing risk, we should look at not taking pupils skiing in America and [to] other such high-risk events.\"</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"There is a place for the purely recreational school visit.

  "<p>Staff and pupils at a primary school where the children speak 26 languages have turned to sign language to ease their communication problems.</p> <p>Lithuanian, Polish, Arabic, Farsi, Japanese, Mandarin, Wolof and Shona are among the mother tongues of the 55 pupils at Fairlight primary school in Brighton for whom English is not their first language.</p> <p>Now all the school's 300 children - and their teachers - are learning to finger-spell words in British sign language and communicate their emotions and feelings using the signing system Makaton. Since the start of the new term assemblies have begun with a signed \"good morning\".</p> <p>The headteacher, Damien Jordan, said the techniques helped pupils who might otherwise get frustrated they could not make themselves understood, as well as being popular with English-speaking attendees. Children who had previously been divided by a language barrier were now communicating among themselves.</p> <p>\"They think it's fantastic,\" Jordan said. \"It makes them proud of their languages and proud to be able to communicate with each other. They say 'It's great, because we're all learning at this stage so we're all at the same starting point'.\"</p> <p>Fairlight's diversity stems from the fact it attracts many pupils whose parents are international students or academics, he added. Some children arrive at the school and nursery, which cater for three- to 11-year-olds, already able to speak two or three languages.</p> <p>Such is the popularity of the signing venture that staff are having to work hard to keep up with their pupils' enthusiasm.</p> <p>\"We've even got children inventing their own signs for things.

  "<p>It could pay to be sceptical next time you check your inbox, according to research which suggests that people are more likely to lie in an email than in other forms of communication.</p> <p>Experts have long known that it is easier to lie in writing than in real life, where deception is made more difficult by physical prompts such as eye contact.</p> <p>But psychological tests conducted by business professors at Rutgers, Lehigh and DePaul universities in the US found people are significantly more likely to lie in emails than in handwritten documents.</p> <p>In the tests, 48 students were given $89 and told to split it with somebody they didn't know and who had little idea how much money was up for grabs.</p> <p>A total of 92% of the students lied when dividing the money over email, while 64% lied when asked to write by hand. </p> <p>In most cases the subjects claimed the pot of money was smaller than $89, but said they would share it evenly with their correspondent and pocketed the difference.</p> <p>Emailers ended up handing over an average of $29 - keeping $60 for themselves - while pen-and-paper negotiators gave up $34 and kept $55 for their own pocket.</p> <p>In a second test of 69 students, subjects were asked to split the money with somebody they knew.

  "<p>All my friends think I'm bonkers, but I think there's something to be said for a national electronic identity system. Not the card as previewed by the home secretary last week - that programme seems to have been designed by an evil genius to put as many people's backs up as possible. What is needed is a means for citizens to authenticate their identity for electronic transactions with officialdom at a level that satisfies both the state's legitimate need to know who we are and our fellow citizens' confidence that public goods are being handed out fairly. </p> <p>This shouldn't be controversial stuff. If this government or its replacement canned the identity card scheme next month or next year, the need to authenticate would remain. It's at the very heart of what everyone wants to achieve with electronic government: public services centred on the user. </p> <p>For the past 12 years, the idea of citizen-centred government has emerged at regular intervals. The latest incarnation is in a programme called Service Transformation, unveiled two years ago by a chancellor called Gordon Brown. Its big idea is to create a one-stop notification service for big life events, starting with births, changes of address and bereavements. </p> <p>Of the three, bereavement is the obvious priority. Anyone who's ever dealt with a death will be familiar with the grinding trudge of sending multiple copies of the same birth certificate to different arms of the state. At best, it's an upsetting chore; at worst it's an insult. </p> <p>Despite a lack of enthusiasm from ministers, progress has been made. However, a national one-stop notification service won't happen until a multiplicity of state agencies agree on a robust way of authenticating the identity both of the deceased person and the individual making the notification. </p> <p>The way ahead involves approaching the problem from the opposite direction. The purpose of a national identity service should not be for the state to inspect its citizens, but for citizens to inspect the state. Specifically, the core data the government holds on our names, address, date of birth and so on. </p> <p>Other governments already do this. The principle that the personal information is the property of the individual, not the state, was established at the outset of the Netherlands' e-government programme. </p> <p>Last month, our government took an oblique step in that direction when the NHS in England conceded that patients should have the same right as their counterparts in Scotland and Wales to be asked for permission every time their electronic health records are called up on screen. The same principle - with obvious audited exceptions in areas such as law enforcement - should apply to all personal data.</p> <p>But the first step in putting citizens in charge is to establish a means of authenticating identity. Few people want their neighbours looking up their DWP files. The mechanism might require a single national identity infrastructure of the kind envisaged by Service Transformation and the ID card; more likely it would involve the kind of smart use of existing databases that Westminster City Council has put into practice to police the issuing of highly valuable residents' parking permits. </p> <p>These are all technical details, and have been well discussed elsewhere. The important thing, though, is for citizens to get the kind of national identity system that suits their own priorities. And if we wanted to carry it around on a nice biometric card, fine. I'd certainly apply for one myself. But as I said, nearly all my friends think I'm bonkers.</p>",
  "<p>When Russia was accused of a cyber attack on Estonia last year, the White House took notice. George W Bush voiced a concern that the US was vulnerable to similar warfare. And when some in the military raised suspicion that Chinese cyberspies had already penetrated unclassified Pentagon computers, the decision was made to start a command to fight for America's supremacy online. </p> <p>The $2bn (\u00a31.1bn) project, which was started under the wing of the air force, was due to become fully operational later this year. Ominous adverts about hack attacks on the Pentagon were commissioned to recruit more people. And then, last month, it was suspended. No reason was given.</p> <p><strong>No-brainer</strong></p> <p>\"The notion that modern countries should consider cyberspace a theatre of war is a no-brainer,\" says Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer at BT and a Guardian columnist on web security. \"It seems like they've had a lot of political manoeuvring over who should run it. The question is not whether there should be one, but where.\"</p> <p>That's not the only question that Air Force Cyber Command had to answer. People weren't quite sure whether it was there to protect air force assets or all cyberspace. Some thought it would only be responsible for computer networks, while others were convinced that anything that used the electromagnetic spectrum would fall under its purview - including laser weapons. And no-one knows why it was put in charge of both cyberspace and space operations.</p> <p>Cyber Command was started in response to millions of attack probes or scans from malicious computers on the Department of Defense's Global Information Grid (or GIG), which encompasses the military's networks, systems and computers. </p> <p>\"The nature of the threat is large and diverse,\" says Timothy Madden of Cyber Command. \"It includes recreational hackers, self-styled cyber-vigilantes, various groups with nationalistic or ideological agendas, transnational actors and nation-states.\" The Pentagon felt a new section was needed because \"much of the DoD's networks, systems, and computers is dependent upon commercial telecommunications links and the internet\".</p> <p>Schneier sums up its role more clearly, saying that Cyber Command is there to take \"any military actions in cyberspace. Blowing things up, making them not work, just like in the real world. It's also offensive and defensive, just like in the real world.\"</p> <p>Sami Saydjari, CEO and founder of online security company Cyber Defense Agency, was one of 54 leading computing figures who wrote an open letter to President Bush in 2002 urging him to secure the internet. \"Potential costs of a multi-critical infrastructure attack on the banking system, the power grid and so on in a sequence designed to do maximum damage approaches the trillions, and the damage would look like a thousand hurricane Katrinas.\"</p> <p>It's not something a 14-year-old could do in his bedroom, however. \"You'd need half a billion dollars and three years,\" says Saydjari. \"But that amount of money and time is not an absolute barrier to entry - nation states or transnational terrorism groups like al-Qaida or even someone like the Russian Mafia, which is not terrorism but organised crime, could certainly raise that kind of money.\"</p> <p>Cyber Command was a step in the right direction, he says: \"They wanted to treat cyber[space] as an area for war like a physical space, which is exactly the way to look at it.\"</p> <p><strong>Rhetorical warriors</strong></p> <p>So is the suspension of Cyber Command going to make America more vulnerable? \"It's hard to answer,\" he says. \"I think having someone in charge and capable of handling the mission is needed urgently.\"</p> <p>Many blame political chicanery in the air force. After scandals about botched handling of nuclear weapons, major contracts going wrong and the firing of the top military and civilian leaders, the service needs time to regroup before deciding on how to fight in the cyber arena. But when and if it does come back online, there are still questions to be answered. </p> <p>Cyber Command has the right to monitor anything that comes across its own networks, for defence purposes, and there's no evidence it's going beyond that. Madden does say, however, that \"cases are turned over to law enforcement or counter-intelligence agencies for further investigation\".</p> <p>Scheier is worried about how rigorously the US government will maintain the line between military surveillance and civilian prosecutions. \"You don't want the military working with the FBI. That's how you get police states,\" he says. \"The army can't take charge of police work because there are laws against that, and the air force shouldn't be able to check up on civilian cybercrime. The needs of warfare are not the same as the needs of peacetime - we don't need howitzers and bombers in peacetime, and we don't need Cyber Command monitoring us either.\" Doesn't the war on terror justify it? \"They're lying if they say that,\" he says. \"They can pretend it's the same as war, but it's not. The war on terror is just a rhetorical war.\"</p>",

  "<p>Congratulations on your excellent article on council housing (Safe as houses, G2, September 30). The arguments in favour of selling-off council houses, such as they were, were well presented as were the ramifications of the iniquitous \"right to buy\" legislation.</p> <p>A great deal of pressure was placed on the beleaguered Callaghan government of the late 1970s to allow councils to dispose of properties. When this debate was being comprehensively aired in the press, I was chairman of a local authority housing committee. The authority was being run at that time by Plaid Cymru and while there was demand for us to sell houses, we were free of the dogma that plagued Labour and Conservatives when making our decision. The crucial factor that decided us against selling was one that I didn't read in the press. It is, simply, that housing authorities such as ours looked at a 10% annual turnover in tenancies. We had charge of some 12,500 properties which meant that we were able to contain our waiting lists by having some 1,250 re-lets at our disposal each year.</p> <p>As you state, the SNP is looking at repealing the \"right to buy\" law. Lack of legislative powers in Cardiff means, however, that this badly needed reform may well be delayed here in Wales.<br><strong>Ben Jones</strong><br>Caerphilly</p> <p>John Harris's feature on council house sales shows a predictable political bias. It is Labour-run councils like Hackney that are driving their leaseholders to despair and bankruptcy with exorbitant charges for external repairs, usually caused by years of negligence and mismanagement of council housing stock. These leaseholders are decent working-class people who have often invested all their savings in improving their homes. Harris is right, of course, that the government turns a blind eye to their plight.<br><strong>David Phillips</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>Attempts at encouraging banks to take over each other, dispensing with competition regulations, are neither desirable nor workable (HBOS rescue in jeopardy, October 1). They are not workable because they only prolong the uncertainty about the viability of the banking system. What is needed is a swift decline in share prices for banks and that is more likely to happen if government stops making half-hearted gestures towards the rescue of troubled banks, so that a large segment of the banking industry can be nationalised quickly at low cost. The loan books could then be stripped of potentially non-performing assets, liabilities taken over by government, for the restructured banks to be returned to the private sector with transparent <br>accounting rules for ascertaining the riskiness of assets. </p> <p>Trust in the banking system would be restored. Proceeds from the privatisation of banks nationalised at a rock-bottom price may well yield surpluses to cover part, if not all, of the liabilities taken over by the taxpayer. Neither the public nor the banks trust the publicly available information about risks that banks have taken. If that uncertainty is removed, bank shares may begin to trade at a higher price. <br><strong>SP Chakravarty</strong><br>Bangor, Gwynedd</p> <p>Will Hutton advocates we slash interest rates, cut taxes and increase public spending at the same time (Comment, October 1). If we did as Hutton suggests, the economy would be in such a mess we wouldn't be allowed to join the euro. The rest of Europe wouldn't bail us out in this way.</p> <p>Admittedly, in following Hutton's plan, we could (briefly) find ourselves on par with the euro while sterling collapsed as a result of unconstrained inflation and huge withdrawals of overseas funds from the UK banking system.<br><strong>William Allen</strong><br>Storrington, West Sussex</p> <p>There is no doubt that bank deregulation is a Tory thing (Letters, October 1). Margaret Thatcher abolished exchange control and created the Big Bang of deregulation. At least \u00a380bn instantly deserted this country and took refuge in offshore havens never to return. Thatcher personally intervened with bank boards and urged them to invest abroad. They did and accumulated billions of bad debts which had to be subsequently written off. </p> <p>Why have none of the political parties advocated the abolition of the offshore centres that siphon off \u00a3400bn annually of tax revenue from the UK economy?

  "<p>So much for the experimental law variations leading to sterile, safety-first rugby. While transgressions around the breakdown were still far too frequent, the first meeting of these two old rivals for 18 months was open and exciting and the result was in doubt until Toby Flood's last-minute interception try made the game safe for the Tigers.</p> <p>While Northampton's director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, made six changes, the most significant of which was the former Sale full-back Ben Foden making his first start at scrum-half, the return of two England internationals, Harry Ellis and Dan Hipkiss, saw the home team begin fluently. Flood converted a penalty in front of the posts inside the first minute and Leicester almost followed that up with a try, Matt Smith's powerful, jinking run ending only when the young wing was driven into touch a yard short.</p> <p>A yellow card to Boris Stankovich for a stupid punch interrupted the Tigers' momentum, however, and by the time the prop came back on, Northampton were ahead. After Flood and Stephen Myler had swapped penalties, a driving run by Foden deep into the Tigers' 22 gave the Saints' pack the platform they needed to drive the prop Euan Murray over the line.</p> <p>Leicester's attempts to hit back were impressively inventive, and their readiness to spread the ball would surely have received material reward had their forwards not persisted in going to ground at the breakdown. Three times the referee, Chris White, penalised them in possession deep in Northampton territory, ensuring the Saints line remained unbroken.</p> <p>Similar transgressions at the other end of the field gave Myler the chance to extend the visitors' lead to 16-9 at half-time, but improved ball retention served Leicester well after the break, the Tigers putting together a series of drives, half-breaks and back-line moves which resulted in a five-metre scrum which collapsed and was reset five times before Saints won the ball against the head. The reprieve was temporary, however, and another five-metre scrum finally produced some points when Ellis' blind-side pass gave the wing Johne Murphy just enough room to squeeze over in the corner.</p> <p>Flood's touchline conversion brought the scores level and with Northampton aware they were beginning to be snuffed out of the game, Carlos Spencer sought to open things up from fly-half. Saints duly retook the lead with Myler's penalty from the halfway line, but with eight minutes remaining Hipkiss showed pace and strength to barrel his way through their defence and regain the lead for Leicester. Spencer's floated pass was then picked off by Flood.</p> <p>\"We played some of our best rugby of the season in the first half, but just didn't execute,\" said the Tigers' head coach, Heyneke Meyer. \"Having Danny Hipkiss back made a big difference, his running was hard and direct. Regarding the ELVs, it's all about how they're patrolled, and the referee was consistent.\"</p> <p>Mallinder was proud of his team's defensive effort, but suggested they gave up possession too easily, especially in the second half. \"We need to be a little smarter,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Leicester</strong> G Murphy; J Murphy, Hipkiss, Mauger, Smith; Flood, Ellis (Dupuy, 65); Stankovich (Ayerza, 49), Kayser (Chuter, 57), White, Corry (capt), Wentzel (Kay, 57), Croft, Herring (Woods, 20), Crane. </p> <p><strong>Try </strong>J Murphy, Hipkiss, Flood <strong>Con </strong>Flood <strong>Pens</strong> Flood 4.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin </strong>Stankovich 9.</p> <p><strong>Northampton</strong> Myler; Ashton, Ansbro, Mayor, Reihana (capt); Spencer, Foden (Dickson, 78); Smith (Tonga'uiha, 60), Hartley, Murray, Lord (Rae, 69), Day, Hopley, Gray, Wilson.</p> <p><strong>Try </strong>Murray <strong>Con </strong>Myler <strong>Pens </strong>Myler 4.</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>C White (Gloucestershire). <strong>Attendance</strong> 17,498.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Snow, who has died aged 81, had occupied a unique position in the cultural life of Britain since the second world war, as a painter, theatre designer, teacher and interventionist. He was also a larger-than-life character, flamboyantly bohemian, a keen biker, a lover of \"happenings\" - already by the 50s a true child of the 60s - and a much loved and influential head of theatre design at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1967 and 1992.</p> <p>He designed the British premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, directed by Peter Hall at the Arts Theatre in 1955. The blasted tree demanded by Beckett stood upstage, behind a grim scrim which parted to reveal the tramps in baggy, pinstriped trousers, battered bowlers and dinner jackets - Snow also designed the costumes - skewered by fate in a bleak terrain of stones, a wooden box and an upturned dustbin. </p> <p>Snow had been working in the theatre since 1951, when he designed Love's Labour's Lost for the Southwark Shakespeare Festival before joining Joan Littlewood, who remained a lifelong friend, at her Theatre Workshop in Stratford East. Two of his most admired designs for Littlewood in 1954 were for the first revival in 300 years of John Marston's The Dutch Courtesan, with Avis Bunnage and George A Cooper, and George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple with Harry H Corbett as the charismatic Dick Dudgeon.</p> <p>Other early theatre work included designs for Lennox Berkeley's one-act opera A Dinner Engagement at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1954, Frederick Ashton's ballet Variations on a Theme by Purcell at the Royal Opera House in 1955, and No\u00ebl Coward's South Sea Bubble, starring Vivien Leigh at the Lyric Theatre in 1956. </p> <p>His first solo show as a painter was at the Prospect Gallery in London in 1951, followed by an important exhibition at the Beaux Arts in 1957, and he would move from the gloomy, so-called \"kitchen sink\" school to a much more eclectic, colourful style over the years, a transition that was completed during a life-changing Churchill fellowship at the end of the 1960s.</p> <p>He stopped first in New York and was astonished by the vigour and excitement of the performance art and avant-garde theatre of that time, before moving on to Mexico to study ancient rituals, masks and the Day of the Dead. Out of this came some of his most vivid painting and two multi-media entertainments, Reflections. The first was held at Oval House in south London in 1971, the second at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1975, which combined elements of tantric sex, motorcycle gear with glam-rock accoutrements and a bevy of naked dancers, doves and magicians.</p> <p>Snow was an open-minded and adventure-seeking maverick who defied his sensible background in Catford, south London, where his father, Frederick, was a civil engineer (later knighted for his work on the Kingsway underpass at the Aldwych, central London, and Heathrow airport). In 1946, he studied briefly at Goldsmiths College and worked as a journalist on the South London Press before national service with the Royal Engineers in the Middle East.</p> <p>He began his association with the Slade with a scholarship there, studying until 1953 and joining the staff in 1957. He was head of theatre design, succeeding Robert Medley, whose key role in the pre-war period was an authenticating factor in Snow's own great success as a teacher. Teaching became his life's work.</p> <p>Students at the Slade included Derek Jarman, Yolanda Sonnabend and Philip Prowse, the last two forming, with Sally Jacobs, a formidable teaching triumvirate, with Prowse as professor. Snow was heartbroken when the theatre design department was discontinued after his retirement. </p> <p>Sonnabend recalled that Snow was both a fantasist and a gentleman, and averred that his paintings, particularly some of the murky, rainy ones that he did of the Kennington area of south London in which he lived, are seriously underrated. He was always witty and delightfully prone, after a drink or two, to say the wrong thing. He began a speech at a dinner to mark the retirement of an otherwise popular Slade director with the remark: \"We all know Bernard's a bit of a shit ...\"</p> <p>Prowse, who went on to be an inspirational director of the Glasgow Citizens Theatre in the 1970s, believed Snow to be much influenced by the Belgian painter James Ensor, a precursor of surrealism. He loved fairgrounds and carnivals, street lights reflected in puddles, all such signs of urban magic. He designed a famous Copp\u00e9lia at a time when the piece was seldom seen, and Prowse recalled with gratitude that he put his name forward for a significant Sleeping Beauty at the Dutch National Ballet. \"He was a very generous man, and he didn't begrudge his students being cleverer than him - which didn't happen very often anyway.\"</p> <p>Snow designed a BBC film about Rex Whistler in 1978 and continued to exhibit regularly at the Beaux Arts and, after it closed down, the Piccadilly and Albemarle galleries. His occasional portraits include studies of Joan Littlewood and Richard Eyre, the film and theatre directors, which hang in the National Portrait Gallery. </p> <p>In 1963 he married Maria Wirth, an Australian colour consultant and interior designer. She died last December and he is survived by their daughter, the painter Selina Snow. In recent years he had suffered from Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p>\u2022 Peter Frederick Briscoe Snow, painter, theatre designer and teacher, born June 6 1927; died August 29 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 4 2008.

  "<p>Like most tech-watchers, I spent last week poring over the T-Mobile G1 specifications - but I simply wanted to know if Android is any good for games. One thing's for certain, this is going to be a very different proposition from the iPhone. Sure, we're getting the same veteran publishers signing up to support the platform. Gameloft, Glu and Namco are all on board. Glu has a new puzzle title named Bonsai Blast, while Namco is offering a free Pac-Man download. We're also getting a similar proliferation of control systems - G1 matches iPhone's touchscreen options, but adds a full Qwerty keyboard and trackball combo, which means that we might finally get a mobile first-person shooter that's actually playable.</p> <p>The big difference, though, is in the contrasting approaches to making applications available to users. App Store is a heavily regulated zone, with Apple getting approval on everything. However, the Google equivalent - Android Market - is an open content distribution system, with few controls. </p> <p>This could result in the first mobile platform that's both friendly to and practical for the indie gaming fraternity. With Java mobile games, there's no reliable route to market for small studios, because of the stranglehold on distribution enjoyed by the big phone networks. The alternative is online distribution, which means creative freedom - but you're only reaching a teeny group. </p> <p>In contrast, Android Market will be available to all Android owners, and the system's user ratings and reviews will provide a filter for the onslaught of mediocre crap that will inevitably flood the service. Also, the lack of any quality control means that experimental, unfinished projects can go up, attracting both constructive criticism and the possibility of development help from other bedroom coders. Gamers also hope that we'll get to see some tasty emulators of classic consoles.</p> <p>It's a legally shady area, but then, on an unregulated site, this stuff is bound to slip through the net. One of the most appealing aspects of the original N-Gage was its brilliance as a portable emulation platform. Another advantage of Android's open architecture is the easy access it provides to the phone's other functionality - US company W2Pi Entertainment, for example, has developed a title named WiFi Army (<a href=\"http://www.wifiarmy.com\">wifiarmy.com</a>) which uses GPS and Google maps to create a real-world first-person shooter where competitors use their phones as guns.</p> <p>So is it good for games?

She had dressed her little boy in his finest kit, and it was obviously a very emotional time. There was also tension in the air; the Serbian forces were not averse to lobbing grenades into crowds. I shot a few frames up close and the picture was used around the world.</p> <p>Two and half years ago, I got an email from a woman living in Perth in Australia saying: \"I know who that woman is; she's my neighbour.\" So I went to Perth and tracked her down. Her name is Gordana Burazor, and Andre, the little boy, is now a teenager, and about 6ft 2in tall. Through all that time, I had always thought she just put the child on the bus, but in fact she managed to bribe her way on board as well.</p> <p>She hates this picture. But when I'm talking to young photographers, I always say it is my kind of image: black and white, and you look into their eyes, trying to read what's going on in their minds, without them even noticing you.</p> <p>She first saw the picture a few weeks after it was taken, and then periodically over the years, but never wanted to contact me. She said she hates it because she was trying to be completely dignified. And the one moment she did what she was trying to avoid - crying - was captured in this frame. </p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Morpeth, Northumberland, 1953.</p> <p><strong>Studied:</strong> \"Self-taught, and then I started on a weekly paper in the north-east.

  "<p>In the political debate over how and why to rescue Wall Street, the most controversial question is conceptual: should the US government save financial firms from their own bad assets?</p> <p>But another question is dividing economists and alarming accountants while sparking little public debate: should financial regulators relax rules that require bad assets to be valued at their current market rate?</p> <p>John McCain says yes. His economic adviser declared the Republican nominee \"pleased to see\" US regulators release a new rule yesterday allowing companies to avoid a declaration of massive losses by setting their own asset values during the worsening financial crisis.</p> <p>\"There is serious concern that these accounting rules are worsening the credit crunch, making it difficult for small businesses to stay afloat and squeezing family budgets,\" McCain adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin said in a statement.</p> <p>Former banking regulator Bill Black has watched McCain's stance on so-called \"mark-to-market\" accounting rules since the presidential hopeful first criticised them days after the Bear Stearns collapse.</p> <p>His verdict on McCain's position is summed up in one sentence: \"It's Keating accounting all over again, and he doesn't see it.\"</p> <p>The Keating Five scandal nearly derailed McCain's career in 1989, as the mass collapse of savings-and-loan banks (S&amp;Ls) was pulling America into recession. McCain and four fellow senators faced an ethics inquiry after meeting with government regulators to discuss preferential treatment for financier Charles Keating's S&amp;L.</p> <p>An investigation following the scandal criticised but did not punish McCain, who now describes the episode as his motivation to reform government. Black, who was in the room during the Keating meeting, sees McCain's support for suspending mark-to-market as proof that the candidate has not learned his lesson.</p> <p>Instituted in November, mark-to-market rules require firms to value assets, such as the mortgage-based securities that lie at the heart of the credit crisis, according to their current value on the open market.</p> <p>Yet when the market for risky securities freezes up, as at present, marking to market can force the value of those assets artificially low in the short term. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can be forced to report punishing losses on their books.</p> <p>Since credit began contracting in the wake of the Bear Stearns failure, banking lobby groups have leaned on Congress to relax mark-to-market rules. McCain, who has blamed the economic blight on \"an inexcusable lack of financial transparency\", appears to have been swayed.</p> <p>\"The Keating Five was about calling regulators in the room and hammering them to back off,\" Black said. \"[Relaxing mark-to-market rules] is probably going to be about calling accountants in the room and pressuring them to screw with the accounting.\"</p> <p>Black, who now teaches law and economics at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, has not shrunk from publicly chiding McCain in the years following the Keating scandal. He is not the only financial expert who sees parallels between suspending mark-to-market and the S&amp;L debacle that ensnared McCain nearly 20 years ago.</p> <p>The Centre for Audit Quality (CAQ), which represents about 800 firms that audit public corporations, urged Congress yesterday to avoid replaying the S&amp;L crisis by suspending mark-to-market rules in its financial bail-out legislation.</p> <p>\"Many of the current requirements stem from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, when we learned that not knowing the real, current values of \u2026 instruments held by financial institutions can be devastating when the bubble finally bursts and institutions are forced to close their doors,\" the CAQ wrote in a letter to Capitol Hill.<br> Economists are split on the wisdom of the rules themselves, and even some supporters of mark-to-market accounting believe it cannot adequately function during the ongoing credit crisis. \"We have to get out of this current clogged environment in credit markets\" before a solution can be found, Jagadeesh Gokhale, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute in Washington, said.</p> <p>Still, Gokhale agreed that a push to relax accounting standards helped fuel both the S&amp;L and the credit crises. Despite mark-to-market's role in driving down asset values, he warned, leaving companies to use their own internal values (sometimes called \"mark-to-model\") could run the risk of overly creative pricing.</p> <p>\"You can't argue for replacing mark-to-market without specifying an additional alternative,\" Gokhale said. \"But in principle, I think whatever that alternative turns out to be, it would be a deterioration.\"</p> <p>Christian Weller, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Centre for American Progress in Washington, is openly critical of marking-to-market.</p> <p>He echoed McCain's concern that the accounting rules are exacerbating the financial downturn, but offered a wry observation: \"The same people who are now asking for a temporary suspension of the rules didn't complain when they reaped the upside in the good years.\"</p> <p>Conservatives, from Newt Gingrich to the Wall Street Journal editorial board, are pressing for Congress to suspend the rules as part of any financial rescue plan taken up this week.</p> <p>The bail-out package that failed in the House of Representatives on Monday empowered the SEC to study the efficacy of marking-to-market. McCain is expected to support that proposal when it comes to a Senate vote tonight, but the calls for a total suspension are highly likely to continue.</p> <p>Barry Bosworth, an economics fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution, said he \"can see arguments for both positions\" in the mark-to-market debate. But the rules, Bosworth added, are nothing if not transparent \u2013 a trait that McCain has frequently said he finds lacking on Wall Street.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of uncertainty about how severe this problem is,\" Bosworth said, \"but it will [fall] into a black box if they suspend mark-to-market.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/10/10032_mccain_campaign_hard_questions.html\">Hilarious write-up</a> from Jonathan Stein at MoJoBlog on a conference call with reporters the McCain campaign set up starring Rudy Giuliani.</p> <blockquote> <p>Moments ago, Rudy Giuliani took three questions on a McCain campaign conference call for the national press corps.</p> <p>The first question was about the bailout. Nothing notable.</p> <p>The second question was from someone named Chuck Pardee. Pardee asserted that Tina Fey, many reporters, and the Democrats make their living \"embellishing the facts.\" After criticizing the press for treating Sarah Palin unfairly, Pardee concluded:</p> <p>\"I guess my question is, do the American people want a straight-shooter or the fluff and stuff?\"</p> <p>Surprisingly, Giuliani said that the American people preferred the straight-shooter and John McCain just so happens to be one. Pardee, by the way, is the \"founder and president\" of Newsbull.com. He has donated the maximum $2,300 to McCain. It's a shock he didn't ask a tougher question. (And if you're wondering, yes, the McCain campaign knows the affiliations of reporters before they are permitted to ask a question on these conference calls.)</p> <p>The third and final question came from a woman named Sherry Riggs (sp?). Her affiliation was not announced. She took exception to Giuliani's claim from earlier in the call that Obama had never managed a budget. A hard-hitting question? Not really. Riggs insisted that Obama had indeed managed a budget \"with William Ayers\" when they both sat on the board of the Woods Fund years ago. According to Riggs, Obama and Ayers funded projects that were \"socialistic in nature\" with a $450 billion treasure chest. That seemed a bit high to me, but I'm sure the McCain campaign would only allow legitimate professionals to ask questions on these calls.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then the call ended. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsbull.com/default.asp\">Newsbull</a> looks like just an aggregator and bulletin board focused on pro-life issues. Interesting how someone who runs a site like that even gets press emails inviting him on to these calls, but stranger things have happened I guess. As for the Woods Fund of Chicago, the board on which Obama sat with Ayers, it's worth just a little less than $450 billion. The <a href=\"http://www.woodsfund.org/Folder_1042751691717/Folder_1207620197753\">2006 annual report</a> lists total assets of $58 million. But I guess I'm just being naive, because <em>obviously</em> they're not going to list in their annual report the $449.94 or so billion that they're secretly spreading around to worldwide socialistic and terrorist groups (note to Woods Fund: that's a joke intended at the expense of loopy right-wingers).</p> <p>Anyway, there's a reason Giuliani took just three questions, and actually only one journalistic question. From the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/09/25/2008-09-25_rudy_giulianis_crass_opportunism_reflect.html\">New York Daily New</a>s:</p> <blockquote> <p>Rudy Giuliani is positioning his law firm to cash in on Wall Street's train wreck - a move that has become a gift to political enemies of his pal John McCain.<br> Even as the nation's $700 billion, taxpayer-funded Wall Street bailout was still being hashed out, the former mayor announced Thursday his high-powered law firm has set up a task force. Its mission: to help corporate clients get a piece of the action - or keep the federal wolves from the door. \"Our team of former government officials and experienced attorneys in the fields of legislation, enforcement and finance are equipped to guide institutions in this quickly evolving and complex environment,\" Giuliani noted in a press release from his law firm, Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. Giuliani is not the only one poised to profit from opportunities created by the mega-meltdown, but he is the most politically famous. Giuliani is a prime surrogate for Republican McCain, who has called the economic meltdown \"the greatest crisis since the end of World War II\" and has assailed Wall Street for \"unbridled </p> </blockquote> <p>greed.\" </p> <p>The News published this last Friday. Strange that Team McCain would want to use him so soon in its aftermath.<br></p>",

Neither is easily confused with being caught in a snow storm or awakened by a loud bang in the night.</p> </blockquote> <p>That last remark relates to Biden's clarification of his claim that he was shot at inside Baghdad's Green Zone: in fact, some kind of projectile landed near the building where he was staying. Biden was shaving at the time, and <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/mccain-campaign.html\">didn't feel sufficiently threatened to duck and cover</a>. Neither anecdote is strictly untrue in the way that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN2540811420080326\">Hillary Clinton's sniper-fire claim</a> was, but still, it all rings a few too many of those bells.

  "<p>Needless to say, the rightwing blogosphere has been in its usual hateful tizz about my arrival at Birmingham. Guido Fawkes claims that I was wearing a Haiwaiian shirt.

He was asking about the internet rebuttal unit I am <a href=\"http://www.prweek.com/uk/home/article/848968/Labour-Tories-plot-dominate-blogosphere/\">supposedly setting up</a>. That's not quite the whole story, but there's no doubt Labour supporters do need to do more to make our case in all media \u2013 the party's new <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/home\">website</a> is a great start.

So I often do my own tough questioning in the old-fashioned way by going along to events and putting my hand in the air at the end. Last month I asked George Osborne about fairness after his <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/events/speechbytheshadowchancellorgeorgeosborne\">Demos speech</a>, and last night I popped into the fringe meeting the Fabians held here with Iain Duncan Smith. He spearheads the <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/\">Centre for Social Justice</a>, and there's no doubting his interest in, and warm words about, the subject. But, like the rest of the Tories' slick PR positioning, it falls apart when you move onto hard policy. I asked him whether giving \u00a31bn in inheritance tax breaks to the country's 3,000 richest estates was socially just \u2013 yes or no? Simple question, no answer. Like the rest of them: nice guys, bad politics.</p>",
  "<p>A decision by the Old Town Ale House in Chicago to hang a painting of a naked Sarah Palin above the bar symbolises the crudely sexist voyeurism frequently encountered by the Republicans' first female vice-presidential candidate since her selection by John McCain.</p> <p>A video of Palin wearing a swimsuit at a 1984 Alaska beauty pageant, intense interest in her shoes and spectacles, and descriptions of her recent UN meetings with foreign leaders as \"speed dating\" point to a Neanderthal approach to women's rights that is still surprisingly common in the birthplace of feminism.</p> <p>Since her shock nomination in August, Palin's candidacy has thrown up a mirror to American life reflecting a host of uncomfortable home truths - and some positive ones, too. Palin has by turns been hyped, eulogised, patronised, ridiculed, and stereotyped in a way that few other politicians, except perhaps Hillary Clinton, have experienced in recent times.</p> <p>Love or hate her, the Palin phenomenon produces strong opinions. That is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/30/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">tonight's televised debate</a> with her Democratic rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> is a must view for much of the nation.</p> <p>The vastly more experienced Biden faces a difficult job. If he is too aggressive, sympathy may switch to Palin. If he pulls his punches, he too will be accused of being patronising and sexist. All the same, since her selection it is Palin's own unforced gaffes and inarticulateness \u2013 not stereotyping and pigeon-holing - that have proven her worst enemy, despite Republican attempts to shield her.</p> <p>On foreign policy, Biden's strong point, there has been a series of slips, leading 57% of respondents in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll to agree that Sarah Palin \"does not have enough experience and understanding of foreign and military issues to be president\".</p> <p>In recent CBS interviews, Palin said the US had already won in Iraq and that provided a template for other conflicts. \"A surge in Afghanistan will also lead us to victory there as it has proven to have done in Iraq,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092502171.html?nav=rss_nation\">she told interviewer Katie Couric</a>. Palin also told a voter in Philadelphia that she would happily send US troops into Pakistan to fight the Taliban and al-Qaida there, a statement that brought a gentle, pained disavowal from McCain.</p> <p>The Alaska governor has also raised eyebrows over Middle East policy, appearing to suggest that the US should not try to \"second guess\" Israel if it decided to bomb Iran's nuclear plants. That even put her at odds with the hawkish George Bush, who reportedly warned Israel's leadership recently that Washington would not support such an attack.</p> <p>As for Iran itself, Palin offered a less than penetrating analysis. \"It's obvious to me who the good guys are in this one and who the bad guys are. The bad guys are the ones who say Israel is a stinking corpse and should be wiped of the face of the earth.\"</p> <p>Palin's claim to have Russian expertise, because of Alaska's proximity to Vladimir Putin's fiefdom, has become a staple of late night television comedy. So, too, has the fact that she lacked a passport until last year. She rebutted that criticism by saying she had been too busy earning a living to go travelling round the world. \"I've worked all my life. In fact, I've usually had two jobs all my life until I had kids.\"</p> <p>On domestic and social issues, Palin's views, to the extent they are known, have also stirred up controversy. In her latest interview with Couric, she reiterated her opposition to abortion, even in the case of rape or incest - a tougher position than that taken by McCain. She said she supported contraception but not the morning-after pill, since \"I am one to believe that life starts at the moment of conception\".</p> <p>Palin also stuck to her guns on global warming, which she maintains is not necessarily caused by man-made carbon dioxide emissions. But in trademark style, she mixed up her words with unintended comical effect.</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm not going to solely blame all of man's activities on changes in climate, because the world's weather patterns are cyclical. And over history we have seen change there. But that kind of doesn't matter at this point, as we debate what caused it. The point is, it's real. We need to do something about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other recent embarrassments concern her apparent unfamiliarity with most supreme court landmark rulings and her inability to name any of McCain's previous Senate efforts in support of financial reform. At a time of national economic crisis, this latter failing has been particularly badly received.</p> <p>Dahlia Lithwick of Slate argues Palin's selection is self-defeating for the Republicans, reflecting in part the contentious question of affirmative action - a big issue this year given Democratic nominee Barack Obama's background. People who were given jobs for reasons other than merit ended up being victimised, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200928/\">Lithwick said</a>, and Palin is no different.</p> <p>\"Palin has become a recipient of the know-your-place treatment ... all of which smells of empty tokenism,\" Lithwick said. \"McCain has mastered the fine art of turning women into campaign accessories: flag pins with nice calves.\"</p> <p>All of which has lent tonight's debate a bizarre fascination. For good and bad reasons, in the Old Town Ale House in Chicago as elsewhere, all eyes are on Palin.</p>",
  "<p>Last Friday the global \"war on terror\" took on a new twist as the US military embarked on a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/pakistan.usa\">fire fights</a> with nuclear-armed ally Pakistan. </p> <p>The strategic backdrop to these events highlights how Washington is failing to both identify and formulate effective policy prescriptions to the evolving security questions posed by al-Qaida's brand of non-state terrorism. Crucially both the recent series of UN meetings and the presidential debate on foreign policy failed to agree upon the limits of hard power in dealing with such entities in the 21st century. </p> <p>Indeed the BBC's latest report suggested that 22 out of 23 countries surveyed believed that the \"war on terror\" had <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7638566.stm\">not actually weakened</a> al-Qaida. This is a huge indictment of the failings of post-9/11 US foreign policy. The attacks were widely seen to be the foreign policy \"game changer\" of a generation. It gave the Bush administration an almost blank cheque to pursue military adventures abroad which only lost traction as they declined so spectacularly. As Senator Obama <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/27/america/27transcript.php\">outlined</a> on Friday \"We hadn't caught bin Laden. We hadn't put al-Qaida to rest \u2026 We took our eye off the ball\".</p> <p>Although al-Qaida's infrastructure in Afghanistan was widely seen to have been significantly degraded by the 2001 invasion, the global al-Qaida franchise has blossomed as US troops engaged in massive wars in Muslim countries. Nowhere is this truer than in Iraq. John McCain is right when he quotes bin Laden who called Iraq \"the most important site\" for al-Qaida \u2013 but the al-Qaida of Iraq is and never was the same as its Afghan-based version.</p> <p>What remained of the Afghan al-Qaida \u2013 including their talismanic senior leadership duo of bin Laden and Zawahiri \u2013 most likely fled to the \"tribal badlands\" of northern Pakistan. They moved from one semi-sovereign space to another \u2013 as it is where an absence of traditional government authority exists, that sub-state groups subscribing to supra-state ideologies are able to operate.</p> <p>An effective US policy towards Pakistan and the governance of its borderlands was far too long-sighted for a naive administration that was focused on the immediate objective of overthrowing the Taliban, whilst continuingly obsessing with invading Iraq. That bin Laden was able to escape from the conventional \"showdown\" in Tora Bora and flee to the tribal north of Pakistan only highlighted the flaws in US policy. How to remove the strategic depth of the Taliban and al-Qaida elements without endangering the strategic, but not democratically legitimate, rule of President Musharraf over a nuclear armed country of over 172 million people? </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas\">Federally Administrated Tribal Areas</a> (FATA) have become a kind of Mordor for western policy makers. It is a wild west of harsh conservative tribes who live by the Deobandi interpretation of strict Islamic law, and do not take kindly to government control. Some 3.5 million people live in this sovereign \"no mans land\", 70% are unemployed and two-thirds live in poverty. Yet instead of trying to improve conditions, the US-Musharraf policy has shown total inconsistency by oscillating between ceding tribal leaders more power and sending in large troop numbers to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7638157.stm\">attack the area</a>.</p> <p>The most recent government offensive against their own people saw 260,000 residents forced to flee in response to heavy air strikes. As security analysts frequently articulate, the Pakistani army is one that is prepared to wage a conventional war against India but struggles when fighting an internal conflict with itself. The undefined links between the Pakistani intelligence service and the Taliban is evidence again of the blurring of relationships across this dangerous geographical area.</p> <p>Pakistan was one of only two countries surveyed by the BBC that did not hold a majority negative perception of al-Qaida. The issue of Pakistan is one of clear divergence between the presidential candidates concerning their policy towards the tribal areas. Where Obama has stated that he would favour <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lionel-beehner/bush-embraces-obama-doctr_b_127097.html\">hot pursuit</a> into northern Pakistan, McCain is more reticent, recognising that \"this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great\". With the shift in foreign policy priorities from Iraq to Afghanistan likely to continue after November 4, Obama supporters should look to challenge whether their man's policy will increase or decrease support for bin Laden's ideology.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron passed the test he set himself today, to survive a difficult party conference without losing the political ascendancy he has painfully won for his party over the past year. Taunted by Gordon Brown's \"novice\" jibe he argued - insistently so - that \"leadership, character and judgment\" matter more. <br><br>If experience was the sole prerequisite then \"we'd have Gordon Brown as prime minister for ever [pause]. I'm not going to go on, there are people in the balconies up there\" (who might jump), he explained. We'd have been stuck with the veteran Jim Callaghan in 1979 too, instead of electing Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>It's far from being the whole story, but it was nicely done. Voters asking: \"Is this fresh-faced youth fit to be prime minister in troubled times?\" will probably be more inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt if that is how things look whenever polling day finally arrives.</p> <p>As with Brown's rival effort in Manchester last week, the speech was too long and sagged towards the end. Even when they're on their best behaviour politicians do distort each other's policies and cover their bases. Brown says he is not anti-business, Cameron that he is not anti-state. We never said they were. </p> <p>Nor is the heartless reply Cameron supposedly got from Alan Johnson about a letter from a grieving husband quite what it seems, Labour officials were quick to protest. As in all conference speech claims, the truth will out.</p> <p>But once he'd worn them into submission - never hard at a Tory conference - Cameron also dared to congratulate his activists on all those \"progressive\" policy changes he says they've made to make the Tories electable again.</p> <p>Social activism, environmentalism, ethnic-minority and female candidates (plenty of them in the warm-up act preceding his arrival), a more generous view of international development \u2026 they hadn't actually done it, he imposed it. They did him the courtesy of listening without enthusiasm or applause.</p> <p>Cameron dealt with the consensual stuff first. He wants to avoid what happened in the US and will help Brown where he can to steady the financial system - in the short term. He reserved his right to criticise. He did a passage on the armed forces (as Brown did not), then moved into the \"values and character\" passage: what he believes, what makes him tick.</p> <p>He does this better than Brown can ever hope to. Of course he does. He reminds many listeners of Tony Blair, not a happy comparison for everyone. He took a swipe at \"do your own thing\" libertarianism. \"For me the most important thing is responsibility.\" </p> <p>Later, he said family mattered most - for him and the country - and took a poke at fellow novice David Miliband for \"arrogantly\" suggesting last week that without the state we're on our own. That's not what Miliband thinks, but never mind.</p> <p>The party-political stuff was routine, the policy announcements minimal. Cameron called himself \"a man with a plan, not a miracle cure\" - no overnight transformations - and kept stressing he is a \"fiscal conservative\" who believes in sound money and low taxes.</p> <p>That sets him apart from the Bush administration, of course, which built up big government and debt despite promising just the opposite. There were plenty of Bushites who just want to cut taxes and restore self-correcting market primacy in the Symphony Hall yesterday. But Cameron had set out his detailed plans for the immediate crisis on Tuesday. All he did here today was warn of tough decisions \u2013 spending cuts and tax rises? \u2013 without spelling them out.</p> <p>Two points worth noting. One, that Cameron came out strongly for the union, as he did not in his \"little Englander\" phase. \"I don't want to be prime minister of England, I want to be prime minister of the United Kingdom.\" Good for him - another point of consensus with Brown.</p> <p>In attacking Labour's \"spendaholic\" habits - Brown's key error since 1997: \"the tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on\" - he also made an interesting distinction. One of Brown's best achievements, he said, was operational independence for the Bank of England (the Tories were actually against it), included within it his other key error: taking away from the bank the power to regulate financial markets and giving it to the FSA.</p> <p>In that decision, he said, lay the seeds of the current crisis. Which brings us full circle. Cameron made a good fist of saying who he is and what matters to him. In proclaiming a capacity for leadership he can point to the control he asserts over his now-docile party.</p> <p>But when he makes light of experience - as a man in his position must do - he invites the response that experience is of value and does matter. Tony Blair had very little such experience when he became prime minister in 1997 - he'd never run anything except the country, as the joke went. </p> <p>In consequence he made mistakes he subsequently came to acknowledge. Cutting Gordon Brown so much slack was probably one of them. Cameron's pitch is always a powerful one - change and hope. But Mr Experience is out there, still trying to prove that a storm like this one needs a weatherbeaten captain at the helm. </p> <p>If the election is not coming before June 2010 voters have 20 months in which to make up their minds. But, as things stand, Brown v Cameron looks a solider choice thrown up by a parliamentary system than the insurgency politics of a US presidential race has yet demonstrated, even in this remarkable year.</p>",
  "<p>Toward the end of the 2004 vice-presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio, US public television's Gwen Ifill asked a question that neither Dick Cheney nor John Edwards expected.</p> <p>It showed.</p> <p>Ifill described an Aids epidemic in the US, where black women were 13 times more likely to die of the disease than other women.</p> <p>\"What should the government's role be in helping to end the growth of this epidemic?\" Ifill asked.</p> <p>For Ifill, it was a memorable moment, one that lived on when viewers wrote to express their frustration with the weak answers the candidates had for her question.</p> <p>\"One of the most gratifying responses afterward came from viewers who knew when questions weren't answered,\" Ifill said.</p> <p>Ifill will be moderating tomorrow's vice-presidential debate at Washington university in St Louis, Missouri, and while Joe Biden and Sarah Palin may listen to dozens of mock questions in their debate preparation this week, they're sure to get one or two from Ifill that they don't expect.</p> <p>What she asks might touch on any topic imaginable under the negotiated rules, which call for Biden and Palin to be situated behind lecterns with shorter discussion periods and two minutes each for closing statements.</p> <p>Given Ifill's hard-news background, her questions are unlikely to be softballs.</p> <p>Ifill, who turned 53 on Monday, has been senior correspondent for PBS's The NewsHour since 1999 as well as moderator of Washington Week on the public broadcast channel. Before that, she covered politics and public policy for the New York Times, Washington Post and Baltimore Evening Sun.</p> <p>Knowing news, Ifill is keenly aware of the interest in the St Louis debate - and especially in Palin.</p> <p>Indeed, a few of Palin's devotees complained to PBS that Ifill's facial expressions after the Alaska governor's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in St Paul last month conveyed something less than rapture. </p> <p>Ifill says it was flat wrong to read anything into how a camera might have caught her at a certain moment and that criticism comes with the job.</p> <p>\"If I was sensitive to criticism, I wouldn't take this job. It comes from both sides,\" she said.</p> <p>An estimated 43.5 million viewers tuned in to Ifill's questions in Cleveland. That number is sure to be higher for the St Louis debate, perhaps closer to the 65.1 million viewers who watched when Geraldine Ferraro took the stage in 1984 against George Bush Sr, the first national debate with a woman competing. (It was moderated by Barbara Walters.)</p> <p>Recalling her moderator debut four years ago, Ifill notes the antidote she has for stage fright: \"As long as I had all the questions, I was the one with the with the upper hand.\"</p> <p>Ifill had more to say during an interview in St Louis:</p> <p><strong>Is there any question about the intense interest in this debate?</strong></p> <p>Judging from my email inbox, there's no question at all. An hour doesn't pass when another self-described bright question arrives. I don't mind it; I want to know what people are curious about. But with so much organised spam email, It's hard to know what's really on people's minds.</p> <p><strong>Is Sarah Palin the reason people are so excited about this debate?</strong></p> <p>Part of it preceded Sarah Palin. At every turn in this election year, there has been exceedingly high interest in this race. I think it matters the presidency is open. When you talk about change - whoever takes this job is going to be very different than we have now. People are engaged.</p> <p><strong>How do you prepare for an event of this magnitude?</strong></p> <p>I don't know (laughing). I'm in the middle of it right now. I just read everything out there. I try to be the best-informed person on the stage and read everything that has been written about people and go as far back as possible.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the final agreement on the debate format?</strong></p> <p>It's actually less restrictive than four years ago [in the Cheney-Edwards debate] even though it's not as open as originally negotiated. In the interest of getting more information, I always think that exchange is healthy and good.</p> <p><strong>Won't this somewhat restrictive format demand more artfulness from the moderator?</strong></p> <p>As it happens it I'm very artful (laughing.) It's kind of like I do every day on NewsHour: I engage in conversations with people and elicit as much information as possible. I think voters are very smart. They can tell whether candidates evade or answer questions.</p> <p><strong>What do you hope is said about this debate afterward?</strong><br>Just that I was fair, I guess. Even that I can't hope for because people are so polarised.</p>",
  "<p>The Tory conference is being staged in Birmingham this week. The cabinet met here three weeks ago. Labour's spring conference was held here too. What in the name of Middle Britain is going on? And what has it to do with JRR Tolkein? More than you might think.</p> <p>Westminster politicians talk a lot more about decentralising Britain's over-centralised state than they actually do about it, though Labour has devolved considerable powers to the three Celtic regions and polyglot London, always too big a city for the size of country whose capital it is.</p> <p>But, even more than London, England is the problem. With 50m of the UK's 60m inhabitants, it is overwhelmingly too large to be part of a simple federal solution. But nor has England had a tradition of regional government \u2013 not since Alfred the Great reunited the kingdom and the Norman military putsch of 1066 imposed harsh foreign rule. No tradition of great city states like Germany or Italy, either. Both have their problems, but our over-centralisation is one today. What can Birmingham teach us? In a <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/cpsfile.asp?id=1039\">pamphlet</a> (pdf) published to mark the Conservatives' visit, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidwilletts\">David \"Two Brains\" Willetts</a>, court intellectual to King Dave, purports to tell us.</p> <p>God stuff it is too. Willetts is a Brummie grammar school boy, the descendant of generations of craftsmen, glaziers, gunmakers and silversmiths. His grandfather helped install the stained glass window at Joseph Chamberlain's new city university in 1900. So he knows the city's history, its sudden expansion in the industrial revolution. During the riots in the 1790s, a Tory mob burned the house of Joseph Priestley, a Unitarian, scientist, free-thinker and one of the \"<a href=\"http://www.birminghamstories.co.uk/story_page.php?id=11&amp;type=fo&amp;page=1&amp;now=0\">Lunar Men</a>\" who met to think and talk. But the city went on to acquire a progressive reputation, the home of John Bright MP, the great free trading MP ( \"free trade is good policy, but bad politics\" Richard Nixon once said, and we heard it on the conference fringe again today); Alexis de Tocqueville called it \"intelligent in the American way\" with its 10,000 factories; then it was the birthplace of municipal socialism, as practised by Chamberlain and the dynamic, modernising Liberal party machine and council he created in Birmingham of the 1860s and 70s.</p> <p>Willetts clocks all this: municipal gas, water and electricity, slum clearance, better schools, the university, the great buildings \u2013 and art gallery \u2013 which have survived Brum's post-war decline and grace the revitalised city today. Much of his power stemmed from Disraeli's legislation of the time.</p> <p>As a Tory, Willetts glosses over the tricky stuff. Neville Chamberlain, a lord mayor like his dad, was also a reformer \u2013 as health minister and chancellor \u2013 not merely Mr Appeasement. Labour too has solid traditions here, and ran the city council for 30 years until <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=18009&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=1289\">Mike Whitby</a>'s Con-Lib coalition took power, consolidating its grip last May. He does stress that when old Joe Chamberlain (who nearly married young <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/LSEHistory/webbs.htm\">Beatrice Webb</a>) split with Gladstone over <a href=\"http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Home_RuleThe_Elections_of_1885__1886\">Home Rule</a> in 1886, he took a chunk of urban Liberalism with him and helped create the urban-rural, progressive/traditional coalition which made it the dominant force in 20th British politics. Continental conservative parties never managed this.</p> <p>Willetts even admits that Chamberlain nearly split the Tories too, over \"imperial preference\" after 1902 \u2013 ie as an opponent of free trade, seeking to resolve the problem of tax revenues by taxing German imports. That issue is around again: it never goes away. So are school franchises, pioneered in Brum when the ancient King Edward's Grammar School became so popular that, rather than go socially exclusive like so many rivals in the late 19th century, it developed a successful franchise: there are now seven. The Tories want to develop Blair's academies along the same lines.</p> <p>I could go on: about the paternalistic housing schemes the Cadburys pioneered, for instance. The point is that London has much to learn from its big regional cities \u2013 my point, not explicitly Willetts' \u2013 but that government, including Margaret Thatcher's (he doesn't say that either) have squeezed local power and initiative. Far too often local government is a mere agent of Whitehall.</p> <p>And Middle Earth? I thought you'd never ask. According to Two Brains, Tolkein lived for a time in Birmingham, which may have inspired his nostalgic rural utopianism \u2013 set in contrast to the toiling orcs of Brum. The twin towers that may have inspired him still stand on Waterworks Road, Edgbaston, near his home.</p> <p>So far as I can tell, representatives (never delegates) like being in Brum. So does the media. We like the ICC conference centre and the security is not oppressive. This is my fourth visit to the city this year. I am starting to know my way around. \"Watch out, London,\" <a href=\"http://www.karrenbrady.com/\">Karren Brady</a>, the Birmingham City FC capo, said this week. Steady on there, Karren, don't get carried away. But two cheers for Brum.</p>",

Brown's experience had created a massive increase in national debt and a huge rises in taxes, Cameron said, vowing to end the prime minister's \"spendaholic culture\". </p> <p>\"The risk is not in making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result. There is a simple truth for times like these. When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going. You've got to change direction.</p> <p>\"These difficult times need leadership, yes. They need character and judgment. The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team, the character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough, the judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made, and to offer the country change.</p> <p>\"Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.\"<br> James Callaghan had held all four great offices of state, Cameron said. \"He had plenty of experience. But thank God we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.\"</p> <p>The address, lasting 65 minutes, was short on policy but strong on the twin themes of change and responsibility. Cameron insisted that the Conservative party had changed because it knew it had to make itself \"relevant to the 21st century\".</p> <p>\"We are a changed party and we are a united party,\" he said.</p> <p>Unlike last year, when Cameron walked around the stage and spoke without notes, the Tory leader stood behind a lectern.</p> <p>He did not copy Brown's example of being introduced by his wife, but she joined him on stage at the end of the speech in Birmingham's Symphony Hall.</p> <p>He paid tribute to her, and in a section on how much he admired entrepreneurs he added: \"I go to bed with one every night.\"</p> <p>Cameron heaped praise on British forces in Afghanistan and said he was a \"deeply patriotic\" person who wanted to be prime minister of the United Kingdom and not just England, in a speech that focused on core Tory values.</p> <p>But Cameron said the thing he most wanted to achieve in government was social reform.</p> <p>\"The central task I have set myself and this party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform. That's how we plan to repair our broken society.\"</p> <p>Strengthening families, school reform and overhauling the welfare system was key to stemming social breakdown.</p> <p>Cameron revived his dispute with Brown, and with Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, over his claim that Britain is a \"broken\" society.</p> <p>\"Some say our society isn't broken. I wonder what world they live in,\" the Tory leader said.</p> <p>On education, in one of the best-received passages of the speech, Cameron said that the straightforward truth was that there were not enough good schools.</p> <p>\"Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The election of a Conservative government will bring - and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the education establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the 'all must win prizes' philosophy and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.\"</p> <p>On welfare, Cameron promised to end the \"something-for-nothing culture\".</p> <p>In a tough message to claimants, he said: \"If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, your lose benefits. Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits. Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them.\"</p> <p>Cameron embarked on a major rewrite of his speech in the wake of the deepening global financial crisis and his unscheduled speech yesterday offering the government bipartisan support.</p> <p>But the Tory leader made it clear today that his pledge to put party politics aside on the economy would not stop him challenging the prime minister on other issues.</p> <p>Hitting back at Brown's \"novice\" quip. Cameron threw back at him what Brown regards as his own great strength - a decade of running the economy.</p> <p>\"To do difficult things for the long term, or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term, it's not experience we need, it's character and judgment. To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.\"</p> <p>But he warned: \"I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.\" And he accepted that he could not prove ahead of the election that he would be a good prime minister.</p> <p>\"It would be arrogant to pretend you can. The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work, how you make decisions and then live with them.\"<br> Developing his promise to help Britain get through the current economic crisis, Cameron vowed to rein in government borrowing.</p> <p>\"Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture, it means clamping down on government waste and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.\"</p> <p>His shadow cabinet will be tasked with reviewing every spending programme to see if it is really necessary.</p> <p>Cameron also made clear the Tory aspiration of an overall cut in taxes may have to wait a long time - and may even be replaced by tax rises.</p> <p>\"I know it's your money. I know you want some of it back,\" the Tory leader said.</p> <p>But he added: \"We will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so once we've made government live within its means.\"</p> <p>The test of whether the Conservative party was ready for government was not whether it could come up with exciting shadow budgets, he said.</p> <p>\"It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve, and say 'no' - even in the teeth of hostility and protest. That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead,\" Cameron pledged.</p> <p>He said that when times were tough, it was not a bigger state Britain needed, it was better, more efficient government.</p> <p>Accusing the Labour government of \"treating people like children\", the Tory chief said it had presided over a health-and-safety, Human Rights Act culture that had infected every part of life.</p> <p>\"When we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader, it's Labour,\" Cameron said. \"They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency.\"</p> <p>Cameron began the speech by underlining his pledge yesterday to work with the government to help protect Britain from the worst of the fallout from the financial crisis.</p> <p>In times of great anxiety, people wanted to know what values he would bring to big situations that arose, he said.</p> <p>\"My values are Conservative values,\" he said. \"For me, the most important word is responsibility. Personal responsibility, professional responsibility, civic responsibility, corporate responsible ... Social responsibility, not state control. Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.\"</p> <p>He said the Conservatives were a progressive party but they understood that real change was best achieved through Conservative means.</p> <p>\"This is the big argument in British politics today,\" he said. \"When the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised ... it is this party ... that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.\"</p>",

Pre-heat the oven to 200\u00b0C/ 400\u00b0F/Gas Mark 6. Use the sharp knife and chopping board to chop the onion, ham and parsley into small bits. Bring a large saucepan of water to boil. Add the macaroni to the boiling water, wait for it to boil again, and give it one good stir to keep the macaroni from sticking together. Turn the heat down slightly and simmer for 10 minutes. Check it every once in a while to make sure it isn't sticking. If it bubbles over the side, turn the heat down a little more.</p> <p>2. While the macaroni is simmering, melt the butter in the medium saucepan or frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry gently for a few minutes. Be sure to push the onion around in the pan so it doesn't stick. Turn the heat down to low, and stir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, cream cheese and Parmesan cheese (keep a little bit of the Parmesan aside for later). Keep stirring until all the ingredients have mixed together. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.</p> <p>3. Add the chopped ham and parsley to the sauce.

  "<p>Political correctness is the work of Satan. So claims Archbishop Peter Akinola of Nigeria, the hero of American conservatives, who see him \u2013 as he sees himself \u2013 as the real leader of global Anglicanism. It's worth looking in this light at his <a href=\"http://www.anglican-nig.org/main.php?k_j=12&amp;d=239&amp;p_t=index.php?\">presidential address to the Church of Nigeria</a> this week, perhaps because it makes him the only world spiritual leader to have denounced a case of sheep-shagging in Bromley. </p> <blockquote> <p>As a Church we cannot but continue to decry the disturbing level of moral decadence and spiritual degradation eating deep into the soul of western societies. In the United Kingdom, all through Europe and in ever increasing number of states in America, lgislators make laws to upturn the natural order and throw God away from the public domain. Marriage and family life as we know them in the word of God have been jettisoned. People of the same sex are legally permitted to marry. Parents' right to discipline their children is legally denied.</p> <p>As if these are not bad enough, only last week the TELL magazine reported in its 36th edition on page 12 that a 27 year old man was arrested for having sex with a sheep in Dulwich, south east London.</p> </blockquote> <p>That story <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2306848/Man-arrested-over-sheep-sex-attacks.html\">is almost true</a>, by the way, though the only place on the net where people have got as upset about it as the Church of Nigeria is a neo-Nazi bulletin board, to which I will not link. </p> <p>Akinola also wants an end to religious toleration, at least as it extends to Muslims in the west. Here's what he had to say on that subject: </p> <blockquote> <p>Hiding under the principle of 'political correctness' Satan has misled many to deny the reality of sin and God's final judgment ... The western world is not only losing its Judaeo-Christian heritage from which it received its civilisation; it is fast becoming antichrist and anti-Church.</p> <p>For Muslims in Britain, it is no longer a matter of asking to be tolerated or begging for equal treatment. Today, Muslims are given preferential treatment. They build mosques in most prime areas and strategic locations in the city of London. It has been reported that it is likely, Muslims might be allowed to introduce sharia law in the UK. And if you must know, Islamic banking has already begun in the UK!</p> <p>But what do Christian minorities in Muslim societies face every day of their life? They may cry and beg for tolerance ad infinitum \u2013all they'll get is persecution and in many instances face the danger of extinction. In general, Muslims have been unable to give to Christian minorities in their domain the sort of freedom and space they enjoy in Christian societies. Thus, they do not tolerate Christian presence nor is there reciprocity.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is to be done about this? His answer seems to me quite clear: British Muslims must suffer as Iraqi or Pakistani Christians do. Otherwise it's not fair and \"Religious tolerance [becomes] a one sided principle that favours one particular religion and inimical to the other. [But] What is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is only if we all embrace the divine injunction: 'do unto others, as you want them do unto you' that we can truly and in all sincerity preach peaceful coexistence and religious tolerance.\"</p> <p>If I have followed his reasoning, he is claiming that since \"we all\" \u2013 ie \"you Muslims\" \u2013 have not embraced this divine injunction, they must themselves be treated as they treat others, and Christians can no longer preach peaceful coexistence and religious tolerance.</p> <p>This is the logic of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/nigeria\">ethnic cleansing</a> and civil war and it is coming from <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200311/jenkins\">a man</a> who is <a href=\"http://www.thirdwaymagazine.com/404\">taken very seriously</a> by millions of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2026348.ece\">otherwise respectable</a> Christians. There is more here at stake than the good name of Bromley as a borough where sheep may safely graze.</p>",
  "<p>At his recent meeting with Russia's Federation Council international affairs committee, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov <a href=\"http://www.ln.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/DCF4188A896EF236C32574C9004B2457\">spoke of</a> the transformation of the system of international relations. He <a href=\"http://www.isria.info/RESTRICTED/D/2008/OCTOBER_3/diplo_30september2008_57.htm\">repeated many of his remarks</a> made there in his address to the 63rd session of the UN general assembly on September 27. The idea of transforming the world order did not come to Russian diplomats suddenly, in the wake of the short victorious war with Georgia in August: even before then, in July, Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, approved the new <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/doctrine/econcept.htm\">foreign policy concept</a> of the Russian Federation. All these documents contain approximately the same ideas. Yet, in his address to the UN assembly, Lavrov said that the crisis in the Caucasus has changed the world in the same way that 9/11 had. </p> <p>If so, why has the concept not changed? This is because, for the Russian leaders, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgian attack on South Ossetia</a> was the last decisive proof that the present world order has, indeed, got to change. In their view, the Georgians could only commit the folly of attacking South Ossetia in the present \"unipolar\" world, in which America does what it wants in its own interests, and enables its allies to behave as they please, while the rest of the world is supposed to comply. During his term as president, Vladimir Putin spoke about it with increasing bitterness, but to no avail. Defeating Georgia was, for Russians, the act of \"rising from our knees\". The compliance, it showed, was over, and so the new world order has got to arrive. </p> <p>According to Lavrov, this new world order would involve the reaffirmation of the principles of international law: for example, territorial integrity and non\u2013interference in the internal affairs of foreign states; the re-introduction of the principle of collective security; reaffirming the role of the UN and the strengthening of the organisation itself and of its security council. So far, so good. </p> <p>But surely, if these principles were to be reaffirmed, they should be applied equally to all? When Russia was bombing Grozny, the Chechen capital, it was defending its own territorial integrity \u2013 but then, when Saakashvili ordered the bombing of Tskhinvali, the Ossetian capital, wasn't he doing the same? And surely, if the American recognition of Kosovo's independence was illegal, from the point of view both of existing agreements and international laws, than Russia's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and Ossetia should fall within the same category. </p> <p>The difference is that, in Russia's perceptions, both Georgia and Serbia are positioned within Russia's sphere of interest, together with other former Soviet republics and some of the former socialist states. Russia is unhappy when any of these states join or want to join Nato. Medvedev's concept of Russia's foreign policy directly states that \"Russia maintains its negative attitude towards the expansion of Nato, notably to the plans of admitting Ukraine and Georgia\u2026\" But if the principle of \"spheres of interest\" \u2013 one of the unuttered, but generally observed rules of the cold war era \u2013 is also back, then what is Russia doing selling Venezuela weapons and developing its military ties with it? Surely, Venezuela is closer to American borders than to Russian? </p> <p>Reassuringly, Lavrov says that Russia would not \"fall into anti-Americanism\" and will not let itself \"be put against Europe\". But in some respects, Russia's new world order is strangely reminiscent of the old one that prevailed during the cold war. Russia's recent strategic military exercise, <a href=\"http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2373395\">\"Stability 2008\"</a>, in preparation for a full-scale nuclear war with the US and Nato is a telling sign of its \"new\" thinking. </p> <p>Russia's policy-makers had better think again. Russia's army is no match for those of either the US or Nato. Despite its new oil riches, Russia still can only afford to spend a fraction of what US spends on its military. And while there has been strong growth, Russia's economy is nowhere near what it should be if it really wants to compete with the west militarily. Neither does Russia have an ideology, distinct from anti\u2013Americanism, that could unite a significant group of allies behind it. </p> <p>The world has long ceased to be either bipolar or unipolar; in its own interests, Russia would do better to bear this in mind.</p>",
  "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>It's great to be here in the Symphony Hall. But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleagues. Everyone is playing the same tune.</p> <p><strong>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS</strong></p> <p>Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right. As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability. I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to \u00a350,000 has been taken up. I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system. I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy. But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made. It is our political duty and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.</p> <p>So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point. We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choice. It is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it. We started to do that in Birmingham this week. We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one. We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in. And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible. The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand. I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success. The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals. Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all. So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.</p> <p><strong>AFGHANISTAN</strong></p> <p>In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history. Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back. And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come back. That would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets. That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent. I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job. Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller. He'd just turned eighteen years old. He was the youngest soldier there. He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world. I told him that what he was doing was exceptional. He told me he was just doing his job.</p> <p>Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right. But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong. In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all. American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home. We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service. That is all wrong and we are going to put it right. We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.</p> <p><strong>GURKHAS</strong></p> <p>And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind. They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burma the jungles of Malaya and the freezing cold of the Falklands. Yesterday the courts ruled that Gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to. They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them. I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it work. Do not appeal this ruling.<br>Let's give those brave Gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.</p> <p><strong>VALUES AND CHARACTER</strong></p> <p>These are times of great anxiety. The financial crisis. The economic downturn. The cost of living. Big social problems. I know how worried people are. They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it. In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans. Of course your plans are important but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government. So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch. And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.</p> <p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p> <p>My values are Conservative values. Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom. Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control. That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today? But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others. That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.</p> <p>For me, the most important word is responsibility. Personal responsibility. Professional responsibility. Civic responsibility. Corporate responsibility. Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country. Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way. To help others. That is what this Party is all about. Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions. Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility? Does this make us a more or less responsible society? Social responsibility, not state control. Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.</p> <p><strong>CHARACTER</strong></p> <p>But when it comes to handling a crisis when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues it's not just about your values. There's something else people want to know. When people ask: \"will you make a difference?\" they're often asking will you \u2013 i.e. me \u2013 will you make a difference? You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister \u2013 and it would be arrogant to pretend you can. The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.</p> <p>I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is. For me. For my country. I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future. I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk. I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference. I am not an ideologue. I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right. I hold to some simple principles. That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government</p> <p>But I am also a child of my time. I want a clean environment as well as a safe one. I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money. I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor. I believe in building a strong team \u2013 and really trusting them. Their success is to be celebrated \u2013 not seen as some kind of threat. Thinking before deciding is good. Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad. Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues. Go with your conviction, not calculation. The popular thing may look good for a while. The right thing will be right all the time. Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying \"we live in a 24 hour media world.\"</p> <p>But this is a country not a television station. A good government thinks for the long term. If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess. We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country. I know that. I'm ready for that.</p> <p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></p> <p>And there is a big argument I want to make \u2013 about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes but about the other issues facing the country too. It's an argument about experience. To do difficult things for the long-term or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right. I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change. To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.</p> <p>Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages. Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change. In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister. He had plenty of experience. But thank God we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever. We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister \u2013 for ever.</p> <p>Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience. The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience. We've experienced the massive increase in debt. We have experienced the huge rise in taxes. We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended. This is the argument we will make when the election comes. The risk is not in making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result. There is a simple truth for times like this. When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going. You change direction \u2013 and that is what we need to do. So let's look at how we got here \u2013 and how we're going to get out.</p> <p><strong>HOW WE GOT HERE</strong></p> <p>At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact. The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long. The debts we built up were too high. Far too high. The authorities \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 thought it could go on for ever.</p> <p>They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever. They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter. But it's not just the authorities who were at fault. Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible. They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out. There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day. Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.</p> <p>In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes. His first big mistake \u2013 and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.</p> <p>Let me explain. At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets. And he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy. He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch. Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision. He feared it would end in tears \u2013 and it has.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing. After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic. His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money. So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help. The cupboard is bare.</p> <p><strong>HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT</strong></p> <p>So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis? How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term? Now I've studied economics at a great university. I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs. And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis. But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.</p> <p><strong>SOUND MONEY</strong></p> <p>First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes. Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down. So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy. That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs. But we need fiscal responsibility too.</p> <p>So we will rein in government borrowing. You know what that means. The country needs to know what that means. And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor. Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad. It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture it means clamping down on government waste and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.</p> <p>So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances. But even that will not be enough.</p> <p>The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise. To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility. There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures \u2013 for all governments, forever. It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes. Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed. You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong. We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.</p> <p><strong>LOW TAXES</strong></p> <p>It's a change that will help us get taxes down. I believe in low taxes \u2013 and today, working people are crying out for relief. Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.</p> <p>But I am a fiscal conservative. So is George Osborne. We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing. So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down. To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare. To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.</p> <p>I know it's your money. I know you want some of it back. And I want to give it to you. It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job. But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so once we've made government live within its means. The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets. It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say \"no\" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest. That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.</p> <p><strong>ENTERPRISE</strong></p> <p>Sound money; low taxes. Simple beliefs with profound implications. And here's something else I believe about the economy. I believe that people create jobs, not governments. I understand enterprise. I admire entrepreneurs. I should do \u2013 I go to bed with one every night. And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland. A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month. You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday. He's from Worcestershire \u2013 and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years. He saw it grow into something he described as \"magical\", employing five people and contributing to the economy. And then along came Labour . Now he's down to his last employee and he says \"I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame.\" What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others. So here's what we're going to do. We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes. We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.</p> <p><strong>BEYOND FINANCE</strong></p> <p>But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance. I have never believed in just laissez-faire. I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry. So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds let's help rebalance Britain's economy.</p> <p>But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn. In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.</p> <p><strong>NO TIME FOR MORE STATE CONTROL</strong></p> <p>Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that. You may have heard it. I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline. It goes like this. In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state. Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too. A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week. It revealed a huge amount about them. David Miliband said that \"unless government is on your side you end up on your own.\" \"On your own\" - without the government. I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.</p> <p>For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between. No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on. No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in. No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance. You cannot run our country like this.</p> <p>It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour. They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency. This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life. If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form. Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer. Even foreign exchanges for students\u2026you can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.</p> <p>No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government. But even more than that we need a stronger society. That means trusting people. And sharing responsibility.</p> <p><strong>NEW POLITICS</strong></p> <p>But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order. That means sorting out our broken politics. People are sick of it. Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism. Copper-bottomed pensions. Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer. Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.</p> <p>This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem. It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out. In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians. And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.</p> <p>That's what I have done. The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list \u2013 they have all got to go. And it's no different in Europe. We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs. With European elections next year, the message to them is simple: If you don't sign, you won't stand. And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics. And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite. Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered. Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics. And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.</p> <p><strong>NHS</strong></p> <p>Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS. Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&amp;E departments are closing. Productivity is down. The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised. I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are. But they have been terribly, terribly let down.</p> <p>Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs, never mind the rocketing costs of social care, we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering. Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year. Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months. Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.</p> <p>In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods. His wife was taken to hospital. She caught MRSA and she died. Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter. He says the treatment his wife received \"was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century \u00a390 billion health service.\" And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her \"sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'.\" I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.</p> <p>This was his reply.<br>\"A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns\u2026<br>\"Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint\u2026<br>\"There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service\u2026<br>\"If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response\u2026<br>\"Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied\u2026.\"</p> <p>A Healthcare Commission. A Health Service Ombudsman. A Patient Advice and Liaison Service. An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service. Four ways to make a complaint but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity. We need to change all that.</p> <p>But here is the plain truth. We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in. Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS. We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients. This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service not a take it or leave it bureaucracy. I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed. We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL REFORM</strong></p> <p>But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government. If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before. It is our plan for social reform. The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform. That's how we plan to repair our broken society.</p> <p><strong>BROKEN SOCIETY</strong></p> <p>I know this is a controversial argument. Some say our society isn't broken. I wonder what world they live in. Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works. Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip. Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets. Children killing children. Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year. A gun crime every hour. A serious knife crime every half hour. A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.</p> <p>But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour. It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us. When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm not just for their own children but for other people's too.</p> <p>Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday. I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year. This woman, whose husband Garry was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstep This woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.</p> <p>Helen Newlove knows our society is broken. But she believes we can repair it \u2013 and so do I. The big question is how. And here is where we need some very plain speaking. There are those who say \u2013 and there are many in this hall \u2013 that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places. And to a degree, they're right. We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.</p> <p>But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates. Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar. But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could. The teenager hooked on heroin. The young man who never knew the love of a father. The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more. Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.</p> <p>There are those who say that all of this \u2013 mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money. And to a degree, they are right too. We are not an anti-state party. In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger. Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards. But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing. That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem. I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes. That will be the test of our character and judgment.</p> <p><strong>FAMILIES</strong></p> <p>First, families. If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support. So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family. I know families can be imperfect. I get the modern world.</p> <p>But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety the family is the best welfare system there is. That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born. To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.</p> <p>Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions. Health visitors are a lifeline \u2013 and I want more of them. It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working. To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say \"wrong\". Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes \u2013 and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country? Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women half the talent of the country are just put off from joining the workforce.</p> <p>We will also back marriage in the tax system. To those who say\u2026why pick out marriage why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times and that's something we should cherish as a society.</p> <p><strong>SCHOOLS</strong></p> <p>When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance. My passion about this is both political and personal. After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it. I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are. He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party. But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children \u2013 and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.</p> <p>There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school. But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities. Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure. That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have. And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up. And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.</p> <p>The election of a Conservative government will bring \u2013 and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the \"all must win prizes\" philosophy and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.</p> <p>Listen to this. It's the President of the Spelling Society. He said, and I quote, \"people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer.\" He's the President of the Spelling Society. Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'</p> <p>And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system. You pay their wages. And do you know what you get in return? They let a child get marks for writing \"F off\" as an answer in an exam. As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'. You're fired.</p> <p><strong>WELFARE</strong></p> <p>If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second \u2013 then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle. This problem goes very deep \u2013 and dealing with it will be very tough. There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits. That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy. Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective. But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.</p> <p>That culture doesn't exist any more. In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages. It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure. Today, it is actively making the problem worse.</p> <p>So we will end the something for nothing culture. If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits. Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits. Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them. I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus. In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad. They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live. The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own. What on earth are we doing with a system like that? With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office: Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.</p> <p><strong>PROGRESSIVE ENDS, CONSERVATIVE MEANS</strong></p> <p>In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice. The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.</p> <p>Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it. This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century as we have shown in the centuries that went before with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli, when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure, when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons it is this Party, the Conservative Party it is our means, Conservative means that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.</p> <p><strong>READY FOR CHANGE</strong></p> <p>Progressive ends; Conservative means. That is a big argument about the future. That is a big change. And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it. We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century. You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need. You didn't champion green politics as greenwash but because climate change is devastating our environment because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.</p> <p>You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous and because this Party that has always believed in one nation must in this century be a Party of one world. This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour. Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.</p> <p><strong>A UNITED PARTY</strong></p> <p>We are a changed party and we are a united party. We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west. The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years. The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years. And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose. And we know that our task is to take people with us. Rebuilding our battered economy. Renewing our bureaucratised NHS. Repairing our broken society. That is our plan for change. But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations. I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.</p> <p><strong>A UNITED COUNTRY</strong></p> <p>These difficult times need leadership, yes. They need character and judgment. The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team. The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough. The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change. Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.</p> <p>I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties whether those problems are created by man or nature.</p> <p>We can and will come through. We always do. Not because of our government. But because of the people of Britain. Because of what you do \u2013 because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination. So because we are united\u2026 Because we have had the courage to change. Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.</p> <p>I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together. Together in the face of this financial crisis. Together in determination that we will come through it. Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Manchester. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Dan Theman (drums), James Cook (vocals), Matt Cocksedge (guitar) and Richard Boardman (multi-instrumentalist). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> A year ago to this very day we let you know that Twisted Wheel were being touted as the Best New Band In Manchester (http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/01/popandrock1) with their typically rough, gruff take on northern prole-rock. Twelve months on, it's Delphic's turn to get that sort of treatment. And it's heartening, in a way, especially for those of us who place a high premium on emotionally resonant rock music propelled by powerful machine rhythms. Because Delphic, a four-piece who rose about a year ago out of the ashes of briefly hyped Manc band Snowfight In The City Centre, are very much a celebration of 80s Manchester. And we definitely mean when New Order's futuristic disco pop ruled the waves and waived the rules - as opposed to 90s Manchester, when Oasis and the Roses made a virtue out of going back to chirpy harmonies and conservatively deployed guitar, bass and drums. <br> So Delphic are looking back to a period when white guitar bands refused to look back. But it's a welcome form of nostalgia, and one that's being given a contemporary kick because they emerge, coincidentally but fortuitously, just as New Order's back catalogue - that decade's most impressive body of work (the Smiths and Prince included) is being reissued and re-evaluated by the music monthlies. Their song titles - Doubt, Counterpoint - are very New Order while some sound so New Order-esque we're perilously close to Oasis-do-the-Beatles karaoke territory: one track, Submission (you can just see that word in some elegant Peter Saville font), has the plangent, trebly bass sound - that could also pass for a deep, mournful guitar sound - of New Order's Brotherhood album.  But there are things that Delphic do, sounds that they make, that suggests a wider remit. There are times when you think not just of the elegiac electropop of Manchester's greatest ever band but also of the stadium prog-grunge of Muse and kinetic indie-rave of Klaxons, complete with acid squiggles and bleeps. Counterpoint is what the third Editors album might sound like if James Ford was employed to work the dials. They describe what they do as \"electronic music played with a full band set-up\" and have been known to stage impromptu, illegal raves because, they say, \"There's no point in playing to a few people in some sweaty toilet venue - we'd rather organise a rave and have hundreds of people dancing.\" As if they need to, they cite as influences Factory Records, the Hacienda and acid house, but instead of recalling the slow, slothful indie-dance of \"baggy\" they've tapped into the rapturous technotronica of their home city pre-Madchester.</p> <p>\"Manchester has this amazing history of bands who could mix rock and dance music,\" say the Delphic boys. \"But that hasn't been done for ages. These days, Manchester just seems to get recognised for guitar bands like the Courteeners or the Ting Tings. We see it as our job to put dance music back on the map. We want to make music for massive warehouse parties.\" </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Combining surging rhythms with powerful emotion, they're crafting a superior brand of future indie that has every chance of rocketing them out of Manchester and into the nation's consciousness.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> If you're going to rob from the past, rob from the best - New Order circa Low-life (look at their MySpace typography!), Brotherhood and Technique.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make Hooky pick up the phone to Bernard. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make the Courteeners go rave. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Delphic's first single Counterpoint will be issued on R&amp;S Records in January 2009 but the band have just signed a deal to run their own label, Chimeric, through Polydor. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> White Lies, Editors, New Order, Klaxons. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/delphic\">MySpace.com/delphic</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Shapes.</p>",
  "<p>The story that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/oct/01/medicalresearch.humanbehaviour\">Catholics can relieve pain</a> by studying pictures of the Virgin Mary is interesting enough on its own. But what would make it really fascinating is applying the same kind of methodology to other belief systems.<br> </p> <p>The research shows clearly that there is a specifically religious component to the effect they have shown. There are, of course, other, irreligious ways of diminishing the experience of pain but they seem to operate in a slightly different way. Feelings of detachment, or of being in control, have been shown to produce a measurable diminution in the experience of pain. So has exposure to images which are merely beautiful. But what was going on in this study was something rather different.</p> <p>According to Dr Miguel Farias, one of the scientists involved, both believers and unbelievers rated the pictures used for this experiment as equally beautiful. They were both renaissance images of lovely young women: it's just that one was known to be the Virgin Mary. So if there was any aesthetic effect involved in the diminution of pain, that was shared by both believers and unbelievers. </p> <p>But the brain mapping images which form a large part of the published paper show that something happens in the brains of believers that does not happen among unbelievers. A different mechanism for pain relief is involved here and this is confirmed by what what people say about their own experience: \"We ask people what they were thinking while they were being zapped. The Catholics rated the picture just as beautiful, but they experience a reinterpretation of the sensation so that it is no longer painful,\" says Farias.</p> <p>So the question becomes whether this mechanism is found in other religions, or other belief systems. Would Protestants be assuaged by a picture of the BVM, or by Orthodox icons? What kind of images might work for Muslims? Is there anyone whose toothache would be relieved by the contemplation of a picture of Richard Dawkins? Probably his wife. Is there anyone who would feel less pain if they studied a picture of David Beckham? Almost certainly. Posh? Less easy to believe.</p>",
  "<p>Careful thought has been given to the form of words to be used by the prime minister in reacting to the latest <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/news/specials/crisiswallstreet/2008/index.html\">crisis of capitalism</a>. There have been repeated assurances that the PM will \"do what it takes\". The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have rallied round in almost patriotic fervour to support the government in doing \"what it takes\".</p> <p>But \"do what it takes\" to do what? </p> <p>Stabilise a system which has allowed homelessness in our country to double over the last decade? Bail out speculators whose obscene incomes and binge consumerism has created a society more unequal than at any time since the 1940s? Attempt to restore confidence in a system which has allowed 3 million of our children to continue living in poverty after 11 years of a Labour government?</p> <p>And who is going to pay for enabling the prime minister with the support of the Cameron-Cable coalition to \"do what it takes\"? People are already paying for the crisis and are increasingly facing real hardship. The number of missed mortgage payments is up 50%, repossessions are up by 48%, unemployment has risen in each of the last seven months, electricity bills are up 18% and gas bills 28%, child poverty has increased in each of the last two years, and 20,000 pensioners are dying each winter from cold-related illnesses.</p> <p>The government must do what is needed, not what it takes. What is needed first is an honest debate about how we got into this mess. The government has a duty to lead the debate on the fundamental causes of this crisis and the Labour party has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the discussion of the profound changes needed in our society to transform an economic system that creates poverty, insecurity and inequality.</p> <p>The seeds of this crisis were sown in the 1980s, when the belief in the unfettered free market moulded the attitudes of a generation of political leaders. Concreted into all governments' policy since has been that it is neither possible nor desirable for governments to seek to fetter finance capital nationally or globally, but labour costs must be constrained by privatisation, deregulation and restraining employment rights. In this market state, the provision of housing, energy, water, health, and education become less and less the essentials of life for which government stands as guarantor and more and more commodities for sale and opportunities for speculative profit-making. If prices soar and wages are held down, demand is reduced but debt can take up the slack to keep the boom going.</p> <p>After three decades of the reign of the economic law of the jungle we can now reassert the basic principle that rational democratic government must control our destinies, not the irrational forces of the market motivated by rumour, speculation and profiteering. Market solutions to market failure will simply risk an unstable rerun of the same mistakes. </p> <p>The government could take four simple steps to demonstrate decisively who is in control:</p> <p>First, rather than reacting on a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7249575.stm\">case</a>-by-<a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/bradford--bingley-nationalized-uk/story.aspx?guid=%7BFF8C6FD0-EE03-4E97-BA71-B2DF0C182C34%7D&amp;dist=msr_2\">case</a> basis as firms collapse, the government should act decisively by nationalising now all those financial institutions involved in home loans or at least taking a determining equity stake in these bodies. The current policy of bail-outs and nationalising the losses whilst privatising the profits of the banks means that ordinary people will eventually pay the cost of market failure. Repeated bail-outs caused Japan's government debt to soar from 65% to 175% of the country's GDP. In contrast, <a href=\"http://www.riksbank.se/templates/speech.aspx?id=1722\">Sweden</a> part-nationalised its banks in 1992 when their imprudence led them to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Second, to avert the prospect of the longest and deepest recession in living memory, the government must reassert democratic control of economic policy by overriding the Bank of England <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/overview.htm\">monetary policy committee</a> (MPC) and cutting interest rates significantly. The remit of the MPC could be widened beyond ensuring price stability to advising on the wider economic health of the country but the bank's policy role should revert to being one voice amongst many others to be taken into account when democratic government not bankers determine our economic policy.</p> <p>Third, the government must re-establish its role in the provision of secure housing, democratically accountable public services and affordable energy. The government programme needed is blindingly obvious \u2013 a massive social house-building programme, repossessions converted to social rentals, ending the privatisation mania, and control of fuel prices or re-nationalisation of energy companies.</p> <p>Four, at a time of economic downturn, the government must ensure that people are secure in their jobs and that their pay reflects the cost of living \u2013 this means abolishing Brown's public sector pay cap, making the minimum wage a living wage, and restoring trade union rights. </p> <p>If the role of democratic government is reasserted, the real debate can now start on what type of democratic government is needed.</p>",
  "<p>Three weeks after Florida began enforcing a controversial law to require tougher identification matches for would-be voters, registration applications from more than 5,000 Floridians have been held up, at least temporarily.</p> <p>In Orange county, just more than 50% of the 672 challenged registrations were from Democrats and about 10% were from Republicans, with the rest showing an unknown party or no party affiliation, according to an Orlando Sentinel analysis.</p> <p>Florida secretary of state Kurt Browning opted earlier this month to start enforcing the law that was enacted three years ago but litigated by civil-rights and voting groups until this summer.</p> <p>The No Match, No Vote law flags Floridians trying to register to vote if their driving licence or social security number doesn't match with government databases. The law then requires the state or county officials to try to notify would-be voters to clear up the problem.</p> <p>Travelling in Kuwait yesterday, Browning said during a conference call that the ratio of rejections in Orange county made sense, given the surge of Democratic voter registrations this election year. More than three-fourths of the 44,521 who registered in Orange from January through August were Democrats, records show.</p> <p>\"I think the same would be true if it were a Republican year,\" Browning said, adding, \"We are not in the voter-suppression business.\"</p> <p>But Democrats said the numbers proved what they've suspected - that the law's enforcement would keep more Democrats than Republicans off the rolls, in part because new Democratic voters are more likely to be minorities and poor.</p> <p>\"It is geared toward people who are registered Democrats, certainly,\" said Orange Democratic Executive Committee chairman Bill Robinson. </p> <p>\"And I think a fair amount of this is intentional.\"</p> <p>Since the law took effect September 8, the Florida division of elections has received 131,540 new voter registrations. The division flagged 20,335 - roughly 15% - for no matches, and sent the 7,293 it couldn't resolve to county election supervisors to resolve.</p> <p>Of those, the counties have resolved 1,969. In many cases, officials said the errors were as simple as someone writing down the wrong number, using a nickname or misspelling his or her name.</p> <p>At a news conference yesterday, several groups that have conducted voter-registration campaigns this year asked Governor Charlie Crist to suspend the law until after the November 4 election to give the state and local supervisors of elections more time to process the flood of registrations.</p> <p>\"We are here today to say these efforts to restrict the vote will not succeed,\" said Travis Mannerlyn, Orlando board member for Acorn, the Association for Community Organisation and Reform Now. Other groups represented included the League of Women Voters and a service-employees union.</p> <p>To demonstrate how easy it is to be tossed out by the new verification process, Tirso Moreno, a coordinator for the Farmworker Association of Florida, held up his driving licence and social security card. </p> <p>The social security card showed his formal name - including his mother's maiden name and father's last name - while the driving licence was shortened to include only his father's last name.</p> <p>\"I don't think this electoral system has the ability to deal with the differences between the two cultures,\" said Moreno. It's a particular hardship for people whose first language is not English, he said.</p> <p>If someone is held up, he or she can still cast a provisional ballot on election day, but would have to return with proof of identification within two days for the vote to be counted.</p> <p>Though Crist said earlier in the day he wasn't \"100% sure of anything\", he did say he was confident the law was being applied fairly and wouldn't unnecessarily disenfranchise would-be voters.</p> <p>\"I know [election officials] are working as hard as they humanly can to do the right thing and enforce the laws correctly,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I don't have the authority to suspend the law,\" the governor added, although voting-rights groups disagree.</p> <p>Floridians whose applications are flagged are notified by mail. Crist said the weeks remaining until the election is enough time to resolve any glitches, presuming would-be voters check their mail. </p> <p>Registration ends Monday.</p> <p>\"It seems to me that if you're responsible enough to vote, you ought to be responsible enough to open your mail, and pay your bills, and do the kind of things that good citizens do,\" Crist said.</p> <p>The state's voter rolls have swelled by more than 537,000, to 10.74 million voters, since the start of the year; more than 314,000 of the new registrants are Democrats, who now exceed Republicans by 500,000 - 4.45 million compared with 3.95 million.</p>",
  "<p>The company at the heart of the tainted milk powder scandal asked officials to help conceal the extent of the problem, the state media said today.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of babies have been taken ill and four have died due to kidney problems after drinking Sanlu infant formula containing melamine, a chemical which should not be used in food.

Firms around the world have been forced to withdraw products due to health concerns.</p> <p>The authorities had already said that officials in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, where Sanlu is based, sat on a report from the company for more than a month before telling provincial bosses. Beijing fired several as a result.</p> <p>But in today's People's Daily - the Communist party mouthpiece - Shijiazhuang government spokesman Wang Jianguo said Sanlu asked for help in \"managing\" the media response to the case when it informed authorities of the problem on August 2. Parents had begun complaining to the firm by the end of 2007.</p> <p>According to the paper, Sanlu's letter asked the government to \"increase control and coordination of the media, to create a good environment for the recall of the company's problem products. This is to avoid whipping up the issue and creating a negative influence in society.\"</p> <p>Wang said his colleagues did send a team to investigate Sanlu as soon as they became aware of the issue.</p> <p>But the People's Daily pointed out that they did not inform the provincial government until September 9.</p> <p>Wang expressed \"deep guilt and pain\" for the scandal, adding: \"We mistakenly thought that taking necessary measures and raising product quality could mitigate the effect and reduce losses.</p> <p>\"The bungling of the best opportunity to report up the handling of the issue caused much harm to people's safety, and seriously affected the image of the party and the government.\"</p> <p>China Daily today quoted Sun Zhengcai, minister of agriculture, as pledging to bring China's milk collection stations under a single supervision system. That should help to address concerns that safety checks are failing because of the complexity of the current system.</p> <p>Jorgen Schlundt, director of food safety at the World Health Organisation, told a press conference in Beijing last week: \"A problem many countries have had is a split in responsibilities between too many different authorities. Clearly it was also a problem here. Fourteen to 16 authorities were involved in the chain, which results in a system which is not optimal.\"</p> <p>The Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine said yesterday that 13% of 154 milk and formula producers tested in a second round of checks had melamine in their products. Most of the products containing melamine were still related to Sanlu and subsidiaries, it added.</p> <p>Zhou Bohua, minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said the dairy industry and authorities had recalled 8,256 tons of milk powder and liquid milk as of Tuesday.</p> <p>Yesterday Unilever recalled Lipton-brand milk tea powder in Hong Kong and Macau after traces of melamine were detected in batches - becoming the latest international food group to be hit by concerns about the issue. It described the move as a precautionary measure and said no other Lipton milk tea powder products were affected.</p> <p>The WHO has said that food can acquire traces of melamine from the environment or its packaging without posing a risk to health.</p>",
  "<p>\"We went to a firin' range,\" recalls Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent. \"Robert [de Niro] was researchin' what he was gonna do as a New York City police officer, so he was around New York City police, shootin' in their firin' range. Al [Pacino] came along towards the end.\"</p> <p>Picture the scene: you're a hard-working New York beat cop, just off a shift, ready to put in some extra hours honing your weapons skills. But when you get down to the range, in the lanes either side of you, hammering round after round into silhouette targets, are Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and the former crack dealer-turned-gangsta rapper and actor 50 Cent. Talk about life imitating art. \"Heh heh heh!\" he chuckles. \"Yeah, it was crazy.\"</p> <p>Is he a good shot? \"I'm good. They'll tell you,\" the 33-year-old grins, nodding at De Niro and Pacino's photos on a publicity poster for the film Righteous Kill, in which he stars alongside them. \"I hit all kinds o' things - those little targets, people...\" And he smiles again, the gurgling beginnings of another chortle wheezing up from his chest.</p> <p>Jackson may be noted for many things, but his sense of humour isn't one of them. Orphaned at the age of eight when his mother was murdered, he was shot nine times and left for dead at the age of 25. Yet in the summer of 2002, the first LP he released after signing a million-dollar deal with the biggest names in hip-hop - Eminem and Dr Dre - became the fastest-selling debut in American chart history. He effected this incredible transformation by turning art into science - by methodically and meticulously planning his music, and leaving nothing to chance. It has made him a star, but a curiously two-dimensional one: his music never gets close to revealing the ready-to-laugh, easygoing, affable yet conflicted personality he brings to conversation.</p> <p>It's tempting to see acting as being easy for him: certainly, he seems to spend most of his time in public putting on a 50 Cent show. Screen work had not been on his agenda - he was approached to, in effect, play himself in the thinly disguised autobiography Get Rich and Die Tryin' (2005) - but if the calibre of his collaborators is any gauge, it has been a steep learning curve. Get Rich... was directed by Jim Sheridan (who directed Daniel Day-Lews in My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father) and one of 50's co-stars was the Oscar-nominated Terrence Howard. Righteous Kill is only his third movie, yet he's sharing screen time with two icons of cinema. Was he under any pressure?</p> <p>\"The opportunity to work with both of 'em was amazing,\" he agrees, \"but I felt I wasn't the only one that was there nervous! The entire cast was. For them, maybe, it's just another project. But for me it's somethin' more: it's exciting to be a part of it. Whether I do another film project or not - and I already completed another one, it'll be out in March [the Louisiana-set Streets of Blood, with Val Kilmer and Sharon Stone] - I'm cool: I got the chance to work with the best.\"</p> <p>Jackson was strong in Get Rich... though was essentially recalling events that had more or less actually happened; and the Righteous Kill roe of Spider, a New York drug dealer, is hardly one he has to spend months researching. The jury is still out on his acting, and he did not prove a big enough silver screen draw to prevent his second film, the Iraq war drama Home of the Brave, in which he starred alongside Samuel L Jackson, Cristina Ricci and Jessica Biel, from tanking at the box office.</p> <p>Music and movies are now just two facets of the 50 Cent brand. He made a reputed $100 million after a mineral water company, in which he had accepted shares as payment for an endorsement, was sold to Coca Cola. And as well as the de rigueur rap star accoutrements (record label, trainer range, streetwear lines, video game), he has even been in negotiations with a South African billionaire to invest in a platinum mine.</p> <p>Jackson's music is just as driven as his business dealings. The chiselled torso on his album sleeves seems an apt visual metaphor for the records' contents: they are the result of hours of hard, repetitive work, honed and toned to perfection, but with seemingly little fun involved in getting to the end result. But that's not how he sees it.</p> <p>\"Conceptually, I don't think people understand the process of what I'm doin' to create the records,\" he muses. \"They just see it as, 'OK, a new song'. But if you listen to the actual records, I'm paintin' pictures, of scenarios an' situations I've seen first-hand. This is where my inspiration comes from: at some point it reflects somethin' that I was actually surrounded by or forced to be around. And the negative things, or bad things, that you experience stick out in your mind a lot more than the positive things. The Curtis album [his most recent, and, at around 4 million worldwide sales, the least successful of his three solo LPs] was supposed to be human, in my head. The laughter at the beginnin' of Straight to the Bank was a symbol of the joy.\"</p> <p>You have to go back to before Jackson was shot to find a song in which he told jokes. How to Rob, possibly the best and certainly the most relaxed thing he's ever done, has 50 running through a lengthy list of rap and R&amp;B stars, musing in spry, pointed couplets on what he might get away with if he stuck them up. The 1999 song sounds like it was recorded while the humour was still fresh, knocked out quickly. \"Right,\" he nods. \"Very quick. It was made out of desperation.\"</p> <p>His girlfriend's pregnancy had provided the short sharp shock that sentences to rehabilitation programmes and an army-style boot camp had failed to deliver; Jackson had decided to abandon his lucrative crack dealing enterprise and, after meeting the Run DMC DJ Jam Master Jay, who encouraged him to write raps and schooled him in song structure, he decided that his future lay in music. He was signed to the major label Columbia, and was working on an album - but his career progress seemed to have stalled, and How to Rob was his attempt to get it moving again.</p> <p>\"Columbia didn't understand who I was as an artist, didn't know how to market me to the public,\" he says. \"The concept of How to Rob wasn't difficult. I knew all the details, I had frivolous information that fit into the song about different artists, without even thinkin' about it. So writing it was easy enough for it just to be fun.\"</p> <p>It worked, earning the newcomer a place on a film soundtrack album, and creating a buzz. But then came the shooting. The circumstances surrounding the attempt on his life remain unclear - the prime suspect was himself murdered weeks later, and while the case has been invoked in other court testimony, no charges were ever brought. If Jackson knows who was responsible, he has never said. To him, the worst was yet to come: as if nearly losing his life wasn't enough, he also lost his job.</p> <p>\"When I was shot Columbia Records stopped communicatin' with me, like I shot somebody,\" he recalls. \"Suddenly, not knowin' what you're gonna do with your life after you've made the decision to write music for a living, everything is more confusing. In that space where you're actually experiencing it, you can get angry an' say, 'I shoulda just been doin' the shooting, 'cos then at least I wouldn'ta had to go through the painful portion of bein' shot.' Some people'll hear that and be like, 'I can't believe he just said that.' But it's because they're not from that environment, they haven't been in those positions and that space.\"</p> <p>The combination of extremes certainly served to harden Jackson's resolve, and when he recovered, he attacked his hip-hop career with the unremitting determination that is a trademark of his albums. Not that 50 reckons his experiences make him a hard man.</p> <p>\"I went to perform for the soldiers in Iraq,\" he recalls. \"<em>Those</em> are the tough guys - the ones who signed up for it. Psychologically, the people that I met aren't even the same people that their loved ones miss at home. Could you imagine how different you'd be if you came in a platoon of 45 people, an' now your platoon is 27, an' then tomorrow it's 21, then 18? They go for different reasons, and the sad part is that some of 'em went for a college education and in exchange they're gonna go to war probably not gonna make it back. They don't say 'Sign up to die for your country,' because the lines'd be a lot smaller. But to kill is different - an opportunity to kill without punishment is what they sign up for.\"</p> <p>Does he really believe that? \"Yeah. If you're goin' to war, what would your expectations be?\"</p> <p>That you might have to kill, but not that you'd necessarily want to. You'd maybe hope that your presence might defuse situations; feel that your job was to keep the peace, not wage war.</p> <p>\"Alright,\" he allows. \"But I think, generally, the guys just decidin' to sign up now? They would be excited about the opportunity to go, especially after bein' attacked. After 9/11, they're gonna sign up to go kill.\"</p> <p>It is a revealing claim. On the one hand, here is an artist who projects a steely invulnerability, erecting impenetrable barriers that prevent his listeners from getting close to an understanding; who has refined his mindset to seemingly eradicate anything other than forward-looking focus, surely in part as a form of emotional self-defence. Yet on the other, here he is, throwing thoughts around in conversation with a stranger which shine light into corners of his psyche that all that hard work and resolve has been built up to hide.</p> <p>\"People don't understand,\" he says. \"In order to be as successful as I've been in the last five years, I can't possibly be what the message is in the music. It's art.\" But maybe it would be more powerful art if 50 Cent could allow himself a little less meticulousness in his method; let himself off his own tight leash, and let his listeners in a bit more.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>50 Cent's new album, Before I Self-Destruct, is due out in December</em></p>",

  "<p>Last night, a funny thing happened on the way to the fringe. Just outside one of Conservative conference's more marginal venues, I was confronted with a rum spectacle indeed: a large gaggle of young men, uniformly dressed in crisp dark suits, speaking in cut-glass accents, and evidently educated at some of Britain's more expensive schools. They oozed a self-belief that bordered on the belligerent, they were all smoking fantastically large cigars, and they rather suggested people playing the baddies in an <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001178/&quot;\">Eisenstein film</a>. If this year's event has been suddenly reinvented as a self-consciously humble summit about the new age of austerity, no one had told them.</p> <p>I was there for a meeting titled \"Making money work for hard-working families\" and focused on the privations of life at the bottom \u2013 and, for some reason, none of the cigar-smoking posse showed up. Instead, I listened to Mark Hoban, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, who joined his fellow panellists in talking about \"financial capability\" \u2013 the stuff of helping vulnerable people to master budgets and bank accounts. Eventually, however, temptation got the better of me, and I asked him about something that's been bugging me all week: given their new-found enthusiasm for talking about poverty and social exclusion, how come the Tories have so little to say about low pay?</p> <p>What's particularly interesting on this score is a recent watershed turnabout in on the political right: Boris Johnson maintaining Ken Livingstsone's emphasis on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/10/london.boris\">living wage agenda</a>, putting it up to \u00a37.45 an hour, ensuring that it applies to employees of the Greater London Authority and people working for companies funded by the London Development Agency, and exhorting business to follow his lead. Though you could just as well ask the Brown government the same question, the fact that it's Boris who has recently made the running on this score made the question pretty obvious: how did Hoban feel about extending the idea into national government?</p> <p>He said he was \"very wary\" of all this, and raising the minimum wage was really not a realistic option. But that was off the point: after all, what's interesting about the Living Wage agenda is that it's cleverer than that, avoiding sweeping legislation, and instead making government an example-setting employer: an instance of what the Cameroons might salute as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives\">nudge\" politics</a>. </p> <p>By way of a reply, Hoban said that he didn't want to go near the stuff of spending commitments \u2013 so, thinking the current emphasis on austerity might be putting him off, I had another go. To borrow from how they talk about their attachment to the government's child poverty targets, might it be something the Tories would at least \"aspire\" to eventually introduce?</p> <p>\"I'm not getting sucked into this,\" he said, and that was that.</p> <p>So it was that we once again arrived at this year's abiding theme: fuzziness, contradiction, and a regular reluctance to come up with stuff that might make for a coherent and practical politics \u2013 a \"plan for change\", as this year's hoardings would have it. To take yet another example, I've just come from an early conference session titled \"Preparing for government\", where I watched Francis Maude simultaneously claiming that the Tories would let loose outside providers of public services while encouraging risk and \"stifling the audit culture\" \u2013 and then assuring his audience that they'd ensure that \"every pound spent would bring a full pound's worth of value.\" </p> <p>To make things worse, I then had to listen again to the shadow minister Greg Clark, who talks about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/toryconference.economy\">new vision for public services</a> in the manner of someone who has cut up a Demos pamphlet from around 1996, made his own magnetic poetry kit and got busy \u2013 so he talks endlessly about social mobility, \"community empowerment\" and the like, but offers precious little with any convincing thwack. His vision of social policy, as far as I can tell, is a pretty nightmarish scenario in which voluntary organisations (or charities, as we used to call them) run public services and the government's current close supervision of such arrangements is \"swept away\". One hesitates to summon up images of the Salvation Army building the saving of lost souls into the delivery of social services, but it's a point that needs making. </p> <p>Elsewhere, in fairness, there might be more worked-out ideas, from George Osborne's council tax cut, though the Tories pretty hair-raising plans for welfare reform, and on to Michael Gove's brand of turbo-charged Blairite schools reform. The problem, though, is this: for all the noise, you still can't quite imagine these or any other Tory ideas being collapsed into one of those all-important political narratives, or boiled down into a New Labour-esque pledge card \u2013 not least because they seem so averse to audits and targets that it'll be almost impossible for them to promise much that might be concretely measured.</p> <p>As evidenced by the aforementioned cigar-smokers, maybe Born To Rule arrogance is getting in the way of coherent thinking. Perhaps the Tories are still counting \u2013 not without reason \u2013 on Labour so screwing things up that they simply have to sit, and wait, and then win. In the shadow of our economic woes, it certainly feels to me as if the tensions between neo-Thatcherism and the return of One-nation Toryism are getting worse, and sowing no end of confusion. Whatever, if they make it to government, the old cliche will apply, and it will be Labour who lost, not this lot who won.</p>",
  "<p>In a couple of postings last week - notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/sep/26/2\">here</a> - I dealt with the accusations made by journalists on almost every national newspaper about other papers stealing their content to enhance their website news coverage. In the two years and more since I started this blog the topic elicited the largest email response I have had as people, requesting confidentially of course, provided examples of (alleged) plagiarism.</p> <p>I found it difficult to check the veracity of most claims because, accepting <a href=\"http://www.countervalue.com/2008/09/25/this-is-not-blogging-roy-its-execrable-tittle-tattle/\">a point well made by the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> journalist, <strong>Justin Williams</strong></a>, it was possible that the similarities stemmed from the original news agency wire sources (to which I have no access anyway). Was a certain quote \"borrowed\" from another site, or did it come from the agency report? It was hard for me to be sure.</p> <p>In some cases, I was convinced that stories had simply been lifted and rewritten. But they usually avoided using direct quotes, making it difficult to prove. What struck me was that papers were, as they always have been, reluctant to give attribution to a rival. The old Fleet Street-style competitive ethos does not allow for such niceties. </p> <p>But an emailer yesterday, followed by another this morning, has pointed to an apparent change of heart by the Daily Telegraph. They pointed to a couple of recent stories as evidence.</p> <p>For example, in this one yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3108082/Sven-Goran-Eriksson-held-phone-away-from-his-ear-in-rows-with-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-Football.html\">Sven-Goran Eriksson 'held phone away from his ear' in rows with Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, the opening sentence reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>In his forthcoming book, FA Confidential, which is being serialised in the Daily Mail, Davies reveals how Sven-Goran Eriksson \"held the phone away from his ear\" as Sir Alex Ferguson \"forcibly\" made his point over the injured Rooney.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this sports story, also yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/tottenham/3107549/Juande-Ramos-splits-Tottenham-dressing-room-as-chaos-reigns-at-White-Hart-Lane-Football.html\">Juande Ramos splits Tottenham dressing room as chaos reigns at White Hart Lane</a>, opened as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Daily Mail reports that Ramos' new regime has led to players who were part of Tottenham teams that twice finished fifth in the Premier League under Martin Jol being barred from the Chigwell training ground dressing room.</p> </blockquote> <p>The day before, the Telegraph website's story, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3101414/Ronnie-Woods-wife-Jo-Wood-says-her-marriage-is-over.html\">Ronnie Wood's wife Jo Wood says her marriage is over</a>, contained the sentences: </p> <blockquote> <p>Speaking at the Berkeley Square Ball, she told The Daily Mail: \"We've been through too much together not to stay as friends whatever happens next. I'm still in touch with him and I've seen him And despite everything I still really care for Ronnie.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Looking back further, I discovered that the sports department has been scrupulous in attributing stories to the Mail. Home news may not have been quite so good in the past (though a September 16 story,<br><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2967379/Marks-and-Spencer-model-Lily-Cole-to-bare-all-in-French-Playboy.html\">Marks and Spencer model Lily Cole to bare all in French Playboy</a>, did mention the Mail as the source of certain quotes) but it is clearly improving.</p> <p>Doing the reverse, testing to see whether the Mail is being as accommodating to the Telegraph, also showed that its sports department is being fair. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1065655/Refreshed-Keegan-ready-return-Newcastle-manager-fans.html\"> Today's <strong>Kevin Keegan</strong> story</a> credited the Telegraph, as did <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1064601/Babel-start-says-Liverpool-boss-Benitez.html\">yesterday's Liverpool story</a>. And a home news <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1061104/Nancy-Dell-Olio-lets-porters-strain-leaving-Labours-party-conference.html\">story about <strong>Nancy Dell' Olio</strong> last Wednesday</a> generously attributed quotes to the Telegraph.</p> <p>So it appears that, at least between these two newspapers, there is an acceptance that explaining the provenance of stories and quotes is ethically correct. Excellent stuff.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> We'll be writing thousands of words about David Cameron's speech over the next few hours, but there's a simple way of determining whether a leader's party conference speech is a success and you can do it just as easily and competently as me: wait of a week and see what you remember.</p> <p>It's eight days after Gordon Brown addressed the Labour conference and it's now clear that the speech was only really remarkable for two things: the introduction from his wife, which was nice but doesn't make much difference in the scheme of things; and the \"it's no time for a novice\" line, which was powerful because it encapsulated all the doubts that voters have about Cameron (being young, lightweight, shallow etc) and it crystallised the argument that, at a time of global economic crisis, we're probably better off being led by a man with Brown's experience.</p> <p>Cameron's task this afternoon is very simple. Somehow - using rhetoric or reason - he has to answer the novice charge.</p> <p>Last night his team released some extracts from the speech that address this point directly. Cameron will say:</p> <blockquote> <p>There's a big argument I want to make - about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, but about other issues facing the country too. It's an argument about experience. To do difficult things for the long-term, or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term, it's not experience we need, it's character and judgment. To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change. Experience is the argument of the incumbent over the ages. Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds good, but on its own, and out of context, I can't tell whether this is really going to do the business.</p> <p>To assess whether I think he has answered Brown, I'll be looking at three things:</p> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> In his \"emergency\" statement yesterday Cameron said that people were \"confused and concerned\" and that they wanted to know what what was going on, what was going to happen next and \"how we're going to get out of this mess\". He said that in his speech today he would try to answer those questions in full. His answers had better be good.</p> <p><strong>Politics: </strong>Don't be fooled by all this stuff about cross-party cooperation. When politicians cooperate in the national interest, as Cameron and Brown are doing now to a limited extent over banking reform, they never stop thinking about how to maximise party-political advantage. It's just that they know it becomes infinitely harder to gauge the mood of the country and strike the right note. (For example, look at John McCain's cack-handed intervention in the US financial crisis.) Cameron has to make the Conservatives come over as a strong alternative to Labour, without appearing to exploit the crisis in a partisan manner. As political challenges go, this is about as hard as they get.</p> <p><strong>Personality:</strong> The novice charge was all about character. Cleverly, it turned Cameron's strengths (youth etc) into weaknesses. Cameron has to reassert his authority.</p> <p>Cameron starts speaking at about 2.50pm. I'll start live blogging shortly beforehand.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Cameron will be starting very soon now. We've just had a series of A-list candidates doing short speeches and the shadow cabinet has come on to the stage. The press office has released the speech and I've had a quick skim through it. No new policy, very few jokes, and, although there's quite a bit about the economy, that doesn't dominate. There are strong passages about the NHS and the \"broken society\". If there's a killer soundbite, I haven't found it yet.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> But there are some sharp comments about Brown. I particularly like the line about taking away from the Bank of England the power to regulate the City in 1997: Brown \"changed the rules of the game but he took the referee off the pitch\". That explains the alleged Financial Services Authority \"mistake\" very clearly.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Back to the conference. Liam Fox, the shadow defence secretary, is now at the podium, paying tribute to members of the armed forces.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> More stuff from the speech. After the bit about \"experience is what they always say when they try to stop change\", Cameron mentions Callaghan and Thatcher. \"If we had listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government ever. We'd have Gordon Brown as prime minister - for ever.\"</p> <p>That could the the soundbite, the line you remember this time next week.</p> <!-- Block 6 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338166202\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/camerons22322.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham on October 1 2008.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Cameron is coming on stage now. \"Ostentatiously carrying his speech,\" Nick Watt says.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Cameron is not doing his \"from memory\" performance any more. His aides have suggested that reading a speech makes him sound more serious. (Although he might have just got bored with having to learn it too.)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Cameron says he will work with the government in the short-term to protect the economy. This gets hearty applause.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Difficulties don't come in some \"neat and predictable order\", he says. This reminds me of the Barack Obama line about McCain having to realise that part of the president's job is dealing with more than one thing at a time.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> He's on to Afghanistan now. Party leaders often start their speeches with jokes, but this introductory passage is heavy, serious.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Cameron says the government is not doing enough to protect British soldiers. There's a very powerful line that Cameron delivers passionately about businesses and hotels turning soldiers away - \"and that is wrong\". This goes down very well in the hall.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> He's moving on the the Gurkhas now. Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, has probably done more to champion the interests of the Gurkhas in the Commons, but Cameron's appropriating the issue now. He urges the government not to appeal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/01/law.military1\">yesterday's high court ruling</a>. By raising the issue, he attacks the government implicitly, without directly having to mention Gordon Brown.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Cameron is talking about character now. He says people want to know about politicians' values, because that determines how they act in a crisis. In his speech, Brown also made a point of asking to be judged on his values.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> He's not a a libertarian, he says, not someone who believes that people should do what they want regardless of its effect on others.</p> <p>\"For me, the most important word is responsibility.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> He says that every time he takes a big decision, he asks if it will \"encourage responsibility\". Another implicit dig at Brown. There's an argument that, by allowing borrowing to get out of control, he was encouraging irresponsibility.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> \"You can't prove you're ready to be prime minister - and it would be arrogant to pretend that you can.\" That's an answer, of sorts, to the novice charge.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> He's a 41-year-old father of three who thinks the family is the most important thing there is. That's about the only reference to his family there is in this speech. I suppose he thinks (rightly) that we know enough about his family already.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> \"Trust your principles,\" will be his guide, he says. he says he will take decisions for the long-term. Tony Blair used to justify short-term initiatives on the grounds that \"we live in a 24-hour world\". \"But this is a country, not a television station.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> It's a good line, and gets prolonged laughter. Interesting that he's attacked Blair before Brown.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> He's on to the \"experience\" passage now, and he's just delivered the \"thank God we swapped him for Margaret Thatcher\" line about James Callaghan. </p> <p>It gets the longest laugh so far. The line about Brown staying for ever falls a bit flat, because the audience could anticipate his line, but he adds something fun that's not in the text. \"I won't go on - there are people in balconies up there,\" he says - ie they would jump off at the thought.</p> <p>\"The risk is not making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result.\" That's clear, punchy.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Cameron is moving onto the economic crisis now. It was quite simple, he says: \"the tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long.\" That's a good, clear metaphor - and it explains what has gone wrong much more clearly than anything Brown has said about the crisis.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Brown's worst decision (to take control of the City away from the Bank of England) was mixed up with his best one (Bank of England independence), he says. He's combining a criticism with a compliment, which sounds mature.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Now Cameron is moving onto the \"what we need to do now\" passage. He points out that he studied economics at university (he did PPE at Oxford - so it wasn't just economics he read), but he says that beliefs count for more than this kind of experience.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> He believes in sound money, low taxes and fiscal responsibility. He's echoing now the themes of George Osborne's speech on Monday,which he describes as the best ever by a shadow chancellor. But I'm not sure he's adding anything new, or explaining it in a different manner.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> \"I'm a fiscal Conservative ... We do not believe in tax cuts paid by reckless borrowing.\" He imagines a calls centre worker or a hairdresser and says he knows they want some of their money back. Looking directly into the camera, he says: \"I want to give it to you.\" He conveys the impression very directly that he's speaking to the electorate.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> He's moving on to his respect for business now and he comes out with the best joke of the speech: \"I admire entrepreneurs. I should do - I go to bed with one every night.\" After the laughter dies down, he adds: \"And I wake up with the same one every morning.\" That line wasn't in the script, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's spontaneous. Politicians often prepare these lines, but keep them out of the text.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> There's a lot of laughter from colleagues who, unlike me, aren't staring at a computer screen. That's because the TV camera has just panned to a shot of Theresa May, the shadow leader of the Commons.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> Cameron is moving on to the role of the state now. He says David Miliband told the Labour conference that \"unless government is on your side, you end up on your own\" and he says it was \"one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say\".</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> The problem isn't Brown or any of his other ministers. It's Labour, and their \"total lack of trust in people's common sense\".</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> Police officers can't pursue an armed criminal without filling out a risk assessment form, and teachers can't put a plaster on a child's knee without calling a first aid officer. He says these things are true, but I'm not convinced. Are they? Does anyone know? If it turns out he's exaggerating, it will be embarrassing given the way he attacked Brown for twisting an Osborne quote in his speech last week.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Now he's on to trust in politics and he attacks the Westminster culture of \"copper-bottomed pensions\" and \"plasma-screen TVs on the taxpayer\".</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Cameron says he's going to tell us how he's going to improve public services. \"Sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> On the NHS, he says Labour has taken \"our most treasured national institutions, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers\". Again, I think he's at risk of going over the top now. Is this how most people experience the NHS?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> But he has a powerful story to back it up. He reads a moving letter from a constituent whose wife caught MRSA in hospital and then died after appalling treatment. Cameron passed his letter on to Alan Johnson, the health secretary, but got a particularly bureaucratic reply. </p> <p>Reading out a list of organisations he was told he could complain to, Cameron says: \"Four ways to make a complaint, but not one way for Mr Woods's wife to die with dignity. By God, we need to change that.\" He rises to an angry, rhetorical crescendo. It's the most powerful moment of the speech so far.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> \"We are the party of the NHS and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.\" A bold claim.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Cameron is on to the \"broken society\" now and he describes working with Helen Newlove, whose husband Garry was kicked to death. She knows society is \"broken\", he says. But she - and he - believes it can be fixed.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> \"Come with me to Wandsworth prison,\" he says. Not the best invitation you'll get.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> But he's talking sensibly, and sensitively, about the link between social deprivation and crime. \"Miss the cause ... and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.\" Or \"tough on the causes of crime\", as someone else used to say.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Cameron says he's not anti-state and that he acknowledges the success state-run programmes have had in fighting poverty.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> But today \"the returns from endless big-state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing\".</p> <p>The family is \"the best welfare system there is\".</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> He's defending flexible working now, saying that business pays the cost of family breakdown. Women are \"half the talent of the country\". Or, as his wife Samantha told him, more than half, he jokes.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> And this takes him to his decision to back marriage in the tax system, a controversial proposal which Labour routinely attacks, on the grounds that it would penalise the children of divorcees and widows, and about which Osborne is said to be sceptical.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> Cameron says he doesn't want to aggravate anyone, but commitment is important. \"Many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me any more, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times.\" That goes down very well too.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> On to education, and Cameron takes a swipe at the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority for allowing a child to receive marks for writing \"F off\" on an exam paper. (I remember hearing someone being interviewed about this - I think the argument was that writing something is better than writing nothing, and it was only two marks.) Cameron says he would have two words of his own for people like that: you're fired.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.05pm:</strong> Cameron now has a go at the so-called \"couple penalty\". He says he was in a benefits office where an official told a woman she would be better off living apart from her boyfriend. \"What on earth are we doing with a system like that?\"</p> <p>He pays tribute to Iain Duncan Smith for making the Conservative party \"the party of social justice\".</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.05pm:</strong> He praises his party for having the courage to change. \"You didn't pick more women candidates to try to look good, you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent.\" Probably true - up to a point.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Winding up, he says these are difficult times that require \"character and judgment\". The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it. \"Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> The Tories are united \"because we had the courage to change\".</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> He leaves the stage to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZTsW8WKy5c\">Let's Stick Together, by Bryan Ferry</a>, who, of course, is the father of pro-hunting campaigner Otis Ferry.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> At the end Samantha comes on stage. Andrew Neil on the BBC says he thinks it's a \"Daily Mail\" speech. All those stories about risk assessment forms probably come out of Daily Mail cuttings.</p> <p>But has he answered the \"novice\" charge? Here's my assessment according to the three criteria I set out earlier.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> There was nothing remotely new in policy terms, but that isn't necessarily a problem. Cameron promised that he would explain his approach to the economic crisis and there was an important passage about this. I think he explained what went wrong in terms that were clear and memorable. I particularly liked the tap-running metaphor and the one about the referee being taken off the pitch. As punchy analysis goes, this is as good as you could expect from any politician. But I don't think he did anything new to explain to the public how the Conservatives would do things differently. He echoed what Osborne said about the (well-received) economic recovery plan, but he didn't say anything at all about the problems on Brown's desk this week, such as whether or not to guarantee all bank deposits and how to stop all the UK's savers putting their cash in Irish bank accounts (which are fully insured).</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Politics:</strong> This was hard, and I thought Cameron pitched his speech well. He avoided blunt, personal attacks on Brown, of the kind he has been happy to make before and which could have seemed inappropriate in the present circumstances. But it was still a partisan speech, with plenty to delight the Tory faithful, that presented a coherent account of how a Conservative government would be different.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Politics:</strong> This was hard, and I thought Cameron pitched his speech well. He avoided blunt, personal attacks on Brown, of the kind he has been happy to make before and which could have seemed inappropriate in the present circumstances. But it was still a partisan speech, with plenty to delight the Tory faithful, that presented a coherent account of how a Conservative government would be different.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Personality: </strong>On TV it looked good. \"With the sound down\" Cameron routinely beats Brown for authority, presence etc - and he did again today. (That's not as stupid a way of judging speeches as it sounds. There's some plausible research to the effect that politicians who \"look best\" on TV - regardless of what they say - are also likely to be the ones who win the approval of voters.) And with the sound up, Cameron intelligently and plausibly answered the novice line. \"That's what the old guys always say\" was part of it. And the other argument was: \"If you want change, don't expect Mr Experience to deliver.\" But I find it significant that I can't put my finger on a key quote in the speech that sums this up brilliantly. \"Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages,\" was good. And the line about Brown going on for ever worked. And \"the risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result\". But I'm not sure whether these are as pithy as \"no time for a novice\".</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>Wait a week and then ask yourself if you can remember any of them. If you can, Cameron's answered the charge. If you can't, the speech failed.</p>",
  "<p>The eyes of the crew flickered with fear, betraying the brave face they were trying to put on. Last year, I travelled to the Kenyan port of Mombasa to interview men who had been held hostage by <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-flash/Guardian/flash/2007/06/11/PIRACY_MAP_120607.swf\">Somalian pirates</a> for 41 days. </p> <p>Just as their food was about to run out they were released because a ransom was paid. In the dry dock, they were preparing their vessel, the MV Rozen, to sail again into the world's most dangerous seas <a href=\"http://www.icc-ccs.org/prc/piracyreport.php\">(this year, pirates have hijacked 30 ships off the coast of Somalia)</a>. They knew their terrible experience at the hands of their captors could happen all over again but they told me they had no choice; they had to earn a living.</p> <p>The ship's captain, Priayantha Perera, who had an AK47 stuck in his belly when the pirates boarded his ship, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/12/audreygillan.international\">spoke of his terrible experience.</a> He warned there was worse to come, that attacks by Somalian pirates would increase. More worryingly, he said: \"The lion's share of the ransom money goes to these militias. Unless they clear the area between Puntland and Mogadishu of militias, they will not be able to stop these pirates ... The pirates who took us told me they were no longer interested in small ships - their main aim is to get tankers and big container ships. They are aiming for British, American, Japanese and Korean vessels. They know that's where the money is.\"</p> <p>Now, it seems he was right, with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/30/somalia.kenya\">hijacking last week of a Ukrainian vessel loaded with 33 combat tanks</a>, as well as rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition. </p> <p>The pirates are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/audio/2008/sep/30/somali.ship.hijack\">demanding a $20m (\u00a312m) ransom to release the MV Faina</a>, which has been surrounded by US warships and other international vessels.</p> <p>This is a highly dangerous situation. When I spoke to Perera, he told me the biggest risk to his life came when coastguards tried to come to the crew's rescue and got involved in a firefight with the pirates.</p> <p>\"The Puntland coastguard started firing at us,\" said Perera. \"The pirates fired warning shots, but the coastguards wouldn't stop shooting. They [the pirates] were all high on <a href=\"http://www.drugdigest.org/DD/DVH/HerbsTake/0,3927,553133%7CGat,00.html\">qat</a> and that makes things even more dangerous. I thought 'We are finished now'. I got on the radio and begged the coastguard, 'Please, please, stop firing' ... They kept on firing and hitting all over the bridge, it was filled with smoke and there were pieces of glass flying everywhere.\"</p> <p>This is what could happen with the Faina. Only this time the pirates have hard weaponry in their hands. When asked how he felt to be surrounded by warships, one of the pirates, said: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/world/africa/01pirates.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin\">\"You only die once.\"</a></p> <p>The pirates may not have a regard for their own lives, but what about their hostages? As the <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4285201.html?page=1\">naval ships circle </a>around the Faina, will they consider the innocent crew when they attempt to take out the pirates? Will they stop for one moment and think of people like Salim Hanafi, a 27-year-old oiler on the Rozen, who told me: \"When we were captured I thought about my children. Who will provide for them if I die? Now I am going back to Somalia ... There's nowhere else to go, except that place.\"</p> <p>The pirates are claiming they have been misunderstood. \"We don't consider ourselves sea bandits,\" their spokesman, Sugule Ali, told the International Herald Tribune.</p> <p>\"We consider sea bandits those who illegally fish in our seas and dump waste in our seas and carry weapons in our seas. We are simply patrolling our seas. Think of us like a coastguard.\"</p> <p>Now that the situation has come to greater public attention through the possibility that the weaponry on board the Faina could get into the hands of Somalian Islamic insurgents, will greater consideration be given to tackling piracy? </p> <p>Two years ago, a British parliamentary select committee said practical government action was \"woefully inadequate ... The government does not even know the scale of the problem. That is failure by any measure\".<br>British citizens were on board the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seabourn_Spirit\">Seabourn Spirit</a> when it was hijacked in Somalian waters in 2005, and in March <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/mar/19/1\">a British captain was released after being held hostage for 46 days</a>. Yet the issue of piracy on the high seas has had little debate in the UK.</p> <p>Will the government pay attention now that the \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jan/10/world.usa\">terrorism</a>\" issue has been thrown into the equation?</p>",
  "<p>Ireland's multibillion euro protection plan for its six big lenders should include a cap on top bank executives' pay, the Republic's Labour party demanded today.</p> <p>Irish Labour leader Eamon Gilmore said his party could not support <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/ireland.europeanbanks\">the \u20ac400bn (\u00a3315bn) package</a> unless it included curbs on executive pay in the banks.</p> <p>The Irish parliament, the D\u00e1il, will sit late tonight to complete the committee stage of the bill which will give guarantees to the country's financial institutions.

The Labour leader added that he wanted to know about possible limits on executives' awards at banks.</p> <p>The credit institutions (financial support) bill is due to pass through the D\u00e1il and Ireland's second chamber, the Senate, tonight. </p> <p>One of the banks included in the scheme, Irish Life and Permanent, said today that the Irish government has made it \"crystal clear\" that the guarantee is not a subsidy to the Irish financial system.</p> <p>The chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent, Denis Casey, said that the government's pledge to cover up to \u20ac400bn of liabilities will bring stability to the Irish financial system, which would in turn stabilise the economy.</p> <p>The guarantee includes retail, commercial and interbank deposits, taking effect immediately and expiring in September 2010.</p> <p>Casey said that banks will pay the Irish taxpayer for the privilege of using Ireland's balance sheet to allow them to borrow internationally and the capital that is in banks will absorb any losses that arise in the normal course of business lending.</p> <p>The Irish foreign minister, Michael Martin, stressed today that his government's guarantee was \"not a free ride\" for the six banks.</p> <p>He added: \"There is a price to be paid for the State guarantee, at commercial rates.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Gordon Brown has said that he wants the Irish government to ensure that its bank deposit guarantee complies with EU competition laws. </p> <p>The EU competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/01/bradfordbingley.creditcrunch\">cast doubt over the scheme today</a>.</p> <p>\"I would like to plead to national governments not to act unilaterally but continue the practice of consulting the commission,\" she said. \"That's a must, and governments have only to pick up the telephone.\"</p> <p>The \u20ac400bn scheme covers Allied Irish, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life and Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society. British depositors with accounts in UK branches of these Irish banks along with savers in the Post Office whose deposits are run by Bank of Ireland are also covered by the protection plan.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Watch <a href=\"http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/2008/09/30/new-chair-for-london-travelwatch/\">brings to our attention</a> the <a href=\"http://www.londontravelwatch.org.uk/news.php?id=611\">appointment</a> of a new chair of London Travelwatch, following the right-and-proper <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7431766.stm\">removal</a> of Brian Cooke for blatantly backing Boris during the election campaign.

The Boris Watcher is probably right that someone will complain about this before too long, though it should be kept in mind that none other than the, ah, deeply moderate Tony Blair had <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/706394.stm\">become a fan</a> of the late MP for Tottenham by the time of his death.</p> <p>Now, on the subject of strife and reconciliation, I've received conflicting reports about going-ons at the TfL board meeting yesterday. \"Boris tried to have two pensioners ejected!\" said one correspondent close to the scene. \"He completely lost control!\" This, it seems, followed a complaint by the pensioners in question about relevant papers not being circulated in advance. \"True!\" confirms another who was there. The Mayor's office told the story differently. \"There were a couple of people complaining about the Thames Gateway bridge,\" I was told. \"Boris adjourned the meeting and had a chat with them, then gave them a couple of minutes to say their piece.\" </p> <p>I asked one of my sources for a description of these pensioners. \"One of them seems to be wearing a monocle,\" I was told. \"It look as though it opens out, like a telescope.\" The Troll, who was there in person, makes no mention of monocles in <a href=\"http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/09/old-hands-push-new-backs-as-boris-takes.html\">his report</a>, but he does mention several other things, including the fact that Tim Parker did not attend. He's <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24393960-7582,00.html\">gone to Australia</a> to sack people. Very few at City Hall wish him a speedy return (and I'm not just talking about the staff).</p> <p>You can now watch the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/webcasts.jsp\">webcast</a> of yesterday's proceedings, as I intend to shortly.

Jack White and Alicia Keys have now got around to filming the video, which features the pair Bonding it up against a blue screen backdrop that is presumably doubling for the Atacama desert in Chile, where a scene from Quantum of Solace was filmed. What do you make of this one?</p> <p>Meanwhile, over in Hollywoodland, someone has decided it would be a <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/09/29/exclusive-eagle-eye-co-writers-working-on-blade-runner-2/\">great idea to pen <strong>a sequel to Bladerunner</strong></a>, Ridley Scott's dystopian 1980 sci-fi classic starring Harrison Ford.

Pegg, whose new film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People is being promoted with <a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2008/posters/how_to_lose_friends_and_alienate_people_ver2.jpg\">a poster in which the comic's familiar features have been airbrushed so dramatically</a> that he resembles a sort of wimpy GI Joe, \"spoke out\" on London's Heart FM radio. He was asked whether he, like Gervais, felt a pressure to fit into the LA lifestyle when shooting in Hollywood. </p> <p>\"He says a lot of things, that man,\" said Pegg. \"He said there'd been no good British films since 1950. What an idiot.</p> <p>\"If you go to LA, you can get sucked into that. I've seen people go there and suddenly become rake-thin because there is a slight pressure on you to be thin.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/publishing.civilliberties\">Inayat Bunglawala</a> thinks I talk \"pure twaddle\". Why? Because I suggested in an article about the firebombers who last week attacked the offices of the publishers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/29/jewel.of.medina.firebomb\">Gibson Square</a> that part of the problem is that too many liberals have come to accept that it is \"morally unacceptable to give offence\". </p> <p>Not so, said Inayat. \"If anyone has given ground in this debate,\" he suggested, \"it is surely those who once believed in banning books because they regarded them as being 'offensive'.\"</p> <p>Inayat himself has certainly given ground. Once a campaigner against The Satanic Verses, he now believes that no one has the right not to be offended. Inayat's welcome change of heart should not, however, blind him (or us) to the fact that much of the rest of the world has been marching in the opposite direction. </p> <p>Gibson Square was attacked because it is about to publish <a href=\"http://www.granta.com/Online-Only/The-Jewel-of-Medina\">The Jewel of Medina</a>, Sherry Jones' novel about the Prophet Muhammad's wife Aisha. It had originally been bought by Random House for $100,000. But the American publishers dropped the book for fear that it \"might be offensive to some in the Muslim community\". Every other major publisher felt the same. It fell to small independents, with a record of defending free speech, such as Beaufort in America and Gibson Square in Britain, to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>This is not, however, just a story about a single book or a single publisher. Many within the political and cultural elite have come to think like the directors of Random House. \"You would think twice, if you were honest,\" said Ramin Gray, associate director at London's Royal Court Theatre, when asked last year by the journalist <a href=\"http://www.newcultureforum.org.uk/home/?q=node/136\">Peter Whittle</a> whether he would put on a play critical of Islam:</p> <blockquote> <p>You'd have to take the play on its individual merits, but given the time we're in, it's very hard, because you'd worry that if you cause offence then the whole enterprise would become buried in a sea of controversy. It does make you tread carefully.</p> </blockquote> <p>In June 2007, the theatre cancelled a new adaptation of Aristophanes' Lysistrata, set in Muslim heaven, for fear of causing offence. Another London theatre, the Barbican, carved chunks out of its production of Tamburlaine the Great for the same reason, while Berlin's Deutsche Oper cancelled a production of Mozart's Idomeneo in 2006 because of its depiction of Muhammed. That same year, London's Whitechapel Art Gallery removed life-size nude dolls by surrealist artist Hans Bellmer from a 2006 exhibit just before its opening, ostensibly because of \"space constraints\", though the true reason appeared to be fear that the nudity might offend local Muslims. Tim Marlow of London's White Cube gallery suggested that such self-censorship was now common, though \"very few people have explicitly admitted\" it. </p> <p>There is a similar climate within TV. Just this month, the comedian Katy Brand, of ITV's Big Ass Show, was forced to drop a sketch called \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2008/aug/22/imamofdibleynolaughingmat\">The Imam of Dibley</a>\" after lawyers deemed it \"culturally insensitive\".</p> <p>Three years ago, after the Birmingham Repertory Theatre had cancelled a production of the play Bezhti, because of protests by Sikhs that it was offensive, Ian Jack, the then editor of the literary magazine Granta, argued for the necessity of self-censorship in a plural society. Whatever may appear to be right in principle, he suggested, in practice one must appease religious and cultural sensibilities because such sensibilities are so deeply felt. The avoidance of cultural pain was more important than the right to freedom of expression. <br> \"The state has no law forbidding a pictorial representation of the prophet\", Jack wrote, \"but I never expect to see such a picture.\" An individual might have the abstract right to depict Muhammed, but the price of such freedom was too high when compared to the \"immeasurable insult\" that the exercise of such a right could cause \u2013 even though \"we, the faithless, don't understand the offence.\" </p> <p>Jack wrote that a year before the Danish cartoon controversy erupted. The response to that controversy showed how deeply embedded such arguments had become. \"I understand your concerns,\" Louise Arbour, the UN high commissioner for human rights, told delegates at the organisation of the Islamic conference summit in Mecca, \"and would like to emphasise that I regret any statement or act that could express a lack of respect for the religion of others.\" The European Union expressed \"regret\" about the publication of the cartoons. Former US president Bill Clinton condemned \"these totally outrageous cartoons against Islam\". The then Russian president, Vladimir Putin, not generally recognised as a supporter of Islam, suggested that the Danish government was using the excuse of freedom of expression to protect those who had insulted Islam. The British foreign secretary Jack Straw praised the British media for not publishing the cartoons and condemned as \"disrespectful\" the decision of some European newspapers who reprinted them. </p> <p>What we are talking about here is not a system of formal censorship, under which the state bans works deemed offensive. Rather, what has developed is a culture of self-censorship in which the giving of offence has come to be seen as morally unacceptable. In the 20 years since the publication of The Satanic Verses the fatwa has effectively become internalised. </p> <p>In a plural society, so the argument for self-censorship runs, social justice requires not just that individuals are treated as political equals, but also that their cultural beliefs are given equal recognition and respect. As the British sociologist <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sociology/staff/tariqmodood.html\">Tariq Modood</a> has put it: </p> <blockquote> <p>If people are to occupy the same political space without conflict, they mutually have to limit the extent to which they subject each others' fundamental beliefs to criticism.</p> </blockquote> <p>I disagree. In a plural society it is both inevitable and important that people offend others. Inevitable, because where different beliefs are deeply held, clashes are unavoidable. And we should deal with those clashes in the open rather than suppress them. Important because any kind of social progress requires one to offend some deeply held sensibilities. \"If liberty means anything,\" as George Orwell once put it, \"it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\" If we want the pleasures of pluralism, we have to put up with the pain of being offended.</p> <p>I am pleased that Inayat Bunglawala has come to agree with Orwell. It's just a pity that he is still in denial about the harm caused by the broader culture of self-censorship.</p> <p><em>This article was amended at 13:15 on October 1 2008</em></p>",
  "<p>Many of the materials and fabrics associated with the luxury goods market are by their nature contentious. The softest leather comes from baby or unborn animals; blood diamonds and rubies often come from exploited workers - these are familiar stories. Few of the super-rich consumers of these goods seem to show much concern about production methods, and it's hardly in the best interests of luxury companies to disseminate this information. One company, however, is telling a rather different story. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.loropiana.com/index_eng.php\">Loro Piana</a> have supplied fashion houses with luxury fabrics since they were founded in 1812, and in the last few decades have branched out into their own designs, with just over 100 boutiques worldwide. One of the most precious fabrics they use is the wool of the Peruvian vicu\u00f1a. These animals are small, wild relatives of the llama and alpaca, and they have an extremely soft coat. </p> <p>The Incas raised them for their fur, which was so luxurious that it was against the law for any but royalty to wear it. However, numbers plunged the minute the conquistadores appeared, as they hunted the animal into near-extinction. By 1974 there were only around 6,000 of the animals left. If the species - and the fabric - were to survive, something clearly had to be done. </p> <p>\"We're not claiming to be saviours of the world,\" says the chief executive, Sergio Loro Piana, who runs the family firm with his brother, Pier-Luigi. \"We need an economic reason of course - we're a company. But we can do things in a good way for both our interests.\" </p> <p>The good way in this case was to start a virtuous cycle with the Peruvian farmers who tend the vicu\u00f1a. \"These are people living at 4,500 metres and they are producing the most expensive fibre and the finest in the world - but most of these people wanted to leave these secluded areas and go to Lima - to the big city. We wanted to do something that would help the indigenous people remain close to their roots, tending the land and the vicu\u00f1a as they always have done, and we wanted to achieve this with the blessing of the Peruvian government.\" </p> <p>In 1994 an international competition was organised and a consortium of three companies - including Loro Piana - won a contract with the government to buy the fleeces. \"Putting the people and the animal at the centre was the concept\", explains Sergio. </p> <p>\"So that meant that we proposed to teach them how to shear the vicu\u00f1a. Which sounds very simple, but unfortunately farmers at that time were more interested in slaughtering the animals for a quick profit. We also proposed not to shear the animals every year - the quantity of the fibre you get at a time is very, very small [around 225g a year per vicu\u00f1a] but these animals live so high and it's very, very cold. So we introduced the idea of shearing them every other year and putting a mark on their ears - a kind of ribbon - to keep track of which ones had been sheared.\"</p> <p>The impact on the farmers is clear - the daily wages are now four times what they were. It may not be much compared to the prices the garments fetch in the west, but it's a living wage and one that ensures the protection and continuation of a species, as well as keeping communities intact. Loro Piana is now taking their investment in the area a step further by purchasing a small amount of land in the Andes where the vicu\u00f1a can be studied. </p> <p>It is a laudable approach. It's easy to snipe and point out that at the prices involved (vicu\u00f1a fabric sells for around \u00a31,000-\u00a32,000 a metre) a company can afford a little compassion. But Loro Piana is still a very smallscale company, producing perhaps 500 pieces a year of some items. Can such a niche brand make a difference? Sergio thinks it can. </p> <p>\"We started this process a long time ago\", he says. \"Back then all this eco-friendly feeling was not around. Nowadays people know the story of the vicu\u00f1a, if they know it all, by word of mouth. And it's actually part of the luxury market - the moment someone is worth enough to afford the best that life can offer then they tend to evaluate the effort behind some of the best fibre. And this is the fibre of the gods. That whole story really has an impact on the luxury consumer.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Are you searching for ethical knitwear? Want to know why you should avoid bamboo?

  "<p>Millions of people who opted out of the <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/PensionsAndRetirement/StatePension/DG_4017827\">state second pension</a> will be given greater freedom to invest for their retirement under a change in the law that comes into force today. </p> <p>Around 8 million people have opted out of the scheme in return for national insurance rebates, which until now had to be redirected into protected rights funds held within personal pension schemes. There is between \u00a370bn and \u00a3100bn held in protected rights funds.</p> <p>Today's rule changes will allow people to transfer protected rights into self-invested personal pensions (Sipps), where they will have greater control over where their pensions are invested. </p> <p>Sipps offer access to a wide variety of assets such as unit trusts, equities and commercial property. </p> <p>The range of investments available through a Sipp could leave pension savings open to a greater level of risk than conventional pension schemes, and are generally deemed to be suitable for people with a reasonably sophisticated understanding of investments. </p> <p>But financial advisers Killik &amp; Co have urged pensions savers to review their options to see whether they could benefit from transferring their funds.</p> <p>\"A lot of people are worried that moving investments in the current market conditions might not be a good idea,\" said Hannah Edwards of Killik &amp; Co. \"But leaving your money in equity-based insurance funds might not be wise either. </p> <p>\"Through a Sipp you could choose to invest completely in cash, or buy into gilts.\" </p> <p>Andrew Sykes, head of retail policy and unfair contract terms at the Financial Services Authority, advised savers to think carefully before making any changes to their pensions provisions: \"We would encourage consumers to make sure they fully understand the implications of leaving the state second pension or transferring accrued protected rights into a Sipp, to make sure it is the right decision for them.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the controversy over whether China's Olympic gold medal-winning gymnasts were old enough to compete, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique has confirmed that it is happy the competitors were not underage.</p> <p>The minimum age for gymnasts in Olympic competition is 16, however a report on the government-run Xinhua website claimed that one of China's competitors, He Kexin, only turned 13 the year before. The allegations prompted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ask the FIG to look into the matter three days before the Games ended.</p> <p>\"Originals of official documents received from the Chinese Gymnastics Association, specifically passports, identity cards and family booklets or Household Registers, confirm the ages of the athletes,\" confirmed the FIG after completing a five and a half week investigation. \"It is considered that the case is now concluded.\"</p> <p>However, the FIG will continue to investigate claims that the Chinese gymnasts who competed at the 2000 Games in Sydney were underage. It is concentrating its inquiries on Dong Fangxiao and Yang Jun. \"The FIG does not consider the explanations and evidence provided to date in regards to these athletes as satisfactory,\" the federation said.</p> <p>The credentials Dong handed in at the Beijing Olympics implied she was only 14 in 2000, while her blog also casts doubts as to her real age. Meanwhile Yang, who won bronze on the uneven bars in Sydney, told Chinese television in an interview that she was only 14 during the 2000 Games.</p> <p>\"It will probably take a while before we can unravel all the legal matters,\" said FIG general secretary Andre Gueisbuhler. \"We have [a statute of limitations] and applicable law is also a factor. We did not have a choice. If we want to remain credible, then we have to look into things.\"</p> <p>The minimum age was raised from 14 to 15 in the 1980s to protect athletes from injury and was again raised to 16 in 1997. North Korea was banned from the 1993 world championships after officials found that Kim Gwang Suk, the 1991 uneven bars gold medallist, had been listed as 15 for three years in a row. In 2002, Romania admitted that several of their gymnasts had lied about their ages, including Olympic medallists Gina Gogean and Alexandra Marinescu.</p>",

  "<p>Police in Japan have arrested an unemployed man on suspicion of murdering 15 people who died in a fire at an adult video parlour in the western city of Osaka this morning.</p> <p>Ten other people were injured, four of them critically, when the fire broke out at Cats, an all-night video shop with private viewing cubicles, shortly before 3am local time, reports said.</p> <p>Firefighters said all the victims were men and they appeared to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning or inhalation burns.</p> <p>Kazuhiro Ogawa, a local man, told police he started the fire by setting alight a newspaper in one of the rooms, the Kyodo news agency said.<br>Ogawa, 46, initially claimed he had been smoking in his room before falling asleep, but later admitted starting the fire deliberately because he was \"fed up with life\", the report said.</p> <p>Investigators said 26 of the shop's 32 rooms were occupied at the time. The fire took 120 firefighters an hour and a half to put out.</p> <p>The shop charges 500 yen (\u00a32.60) an hour or 1,500 yen for 11 hours from 11pm for a room equipped with a reclining chair, TV and DVD player, as well as access to a large selection of mainly pornographic films and comics.</p> <p>Customers who fled the building said the shop had no smoke alarms, emergency lights or exits, and they received no evacuation directions from the three staff.</p> <p>One survivor, a 37-year-old man who had been sleeping there after missing his last train, said he was lucky to be alive. \"The layout is so complicated that people visiting for the first time would have found it difficult to escape,\" he told Kyodo.</p> <p>The high death toll has promoted renewed concerns about lax safety standards in Japan's huge adult entertainment industry.</p> <p>In 2001, a suspected arson attack at a building in Tokyo's seedy Kabukicho district killed 44 people. It was the worst fire disaster in Japanese postwar history.</p> <p>The victims included 12 women in their 20s who worked at Super Loose, a pub where customers were served drinks by women dressed in school uniforms.</p> <p>An investigation found the building had no fire doors or smoke control system and the emergency stairs were blocked.</p> <p>In July this year, five men including the building's owner were given suspended prison sentences after being found guilty of professional negligence.</p> <p>Despite a police crackdown on commercial sex establishments in big cities, the number of Japanese stores offering pornography and cheap accommodation has soared in recent years.</p> <p>They are particularly popular with inebriated working men who have missed their last train and need somewhere to sleep. For a fraction of the price of a hotel room, many also provide showers, cheap food and drink, and allow smoking.</p>",
  "<p>Russian troops have allowed European Union monitors to enter a buffer zone on the edge of Georgia's separatist province of South Ossetia despite an earlier warning to them to stay out of the area.</p> <p>Unarmed EU monitors in light armoured vehicles launched patrols in several areas near South Ossetia, in line with a French-brokered truce.</p> <p>Russian troops manning a checkpoint near the city of Gori, in central Georgia allowed two EU patrol vehicles into the buffer zone after a brief conversation with monitors.</p> <p>The French monitors, in blue berets, returned through the heavily fortified checkpoint past a Russian flag around 90 minutes later.</p> <p>The Russian soldiers did not allow reporters to follow the observers into the buffer zone but let Georgian civilians pass, after examining their vehicles.</p> <p>\"The situation is very calm,\" Ivan Kukushkin, a Russian officer in charge of the checkpoint said.</p> <p>Local people said looting and cattle rustling by South Ossetian paramilitaries continued beyond the checkpoint.</p> <p>The EU mission head, Hansjoerg Haber, told reporters the Russian military had warned the 300 EU monitors against entering the buffer zone, citing concerns for their security.</p> <p>\"We received different signals,\" Haber said. \"We want to clarify these differences in the coming hours.\"</p> <p>Haber told the monitors to \"Show the flag, be friendly, show confidence,\" during their patrols.</p> <p>In Gori, another group of EU monitors boarded their light armoured vehicles to head towards the buffer zone outside South Ossetia.</p> <p>\"Following first reports, the start of ... operations went smoothly,\" an EU mission spokesperson told Reuters. \"Patrols made first contact with authorities and population. They also passed different Russian checkpoints and entered the so-called adjacent areas.\"</p> <p>Russia and Georgia agreed to the EU observer mission as part of an updated ceasefire plan after the conflict, which ended with Russian and separatist forces in control of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russian troops remained deep inside Georgia for weeks.</p> <p>Moscow agreed to withdraw its forces completely from territories outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia - the buffer zone included - within 10 days of the EU monitors' deployment.</p> <p>The EU's head of foreign policy, Javier Solana, on a visit to Georgia yesterday was hopeful Moscow would pull its troops back from the security zone within the promised timeframe.</p> <p>\"I am optimistic that all parties will comply with the agreement that was signed,\" Solana said. \"We hope very much, and we are sure, that before October 10 that part of the mission will be completed.\"</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said he would not be happy \"until the last Russian soldier gets out of my country\".</p> <p>The EU observers will be based in four semi-permanent locations including Gori and the Black Sea port of Poti, key targets of Russian forces.</p> <p>The war began on August 7, when Georgian troops launched an offensive to regain control of South Ossetia. Russia sent troops, who quickly routed the Georgian military and pushed deep into Georgia.</p> <p>Russia's military action and its subsequent recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia drew strong condemnation from the west, which urged Moscow to respect Georgia's sovereignty.</p> <p>Russia plans to keep around 7,600 troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and has refused to allow EU monitors inside the regions themselves.</p>",
  "<p>A strange blend of frenetic activity and quiet dominated in Washington and New York yesterday. Congress officially paused for the Jewish New Year, and shares recovered in anticipation of some kind of bail-out deal. Meanwhile, President Bush met with John McCain and Barack Obama, and Senate leaders, in a highly unusual development, agreed to hold a vote on the $700bn proposal tonight, before the House of Representatives had passed it. Both presidential candidates stressed the need for bipartisanship; McCain even seemed to deny that he had attacked Obama yesterday for playing politics with the financial crisis. For his part, Obama edged closer to playing a more active role in the negotiations, promoting his proposal to increase government insurance of bank deposits.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in New York, mayor Michael Bloomberg announced plans to run for a third term as mayor, a move that will require a change in city law.

  "<p>Brazil's new environment minister, Carlos Minc, announced this week that he will be pressing for criminal charges against 100 of the worst individuals or companies responsible for most of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/30/forests.brazil\">deforestation</a> since 2005. New figures just released show that the rate of deforestation has increased by 133% since last month in the nine states of the Amazon region, which is an increase of 228% compared to a year ago.</p> <p>Minc also said that the government will create an environmental police force with 3,000 heavily armed and specially trained officers to enforce the law. \"I am a pacifist and environmentalist,\" he told journalists, \"but without greater repression we are not going to end the destruction of the Amazon.\"</p> <p>Top of Minc's list of culprits is the <a href=\"http://www.incra.gov.br/\">Brazilian National Institute for Agrarian Reform</a> (Inrca), responsible for finding land for Brazil's large landless population, whose settlements in the Amazon are ranked amongst the top eight worst offenders. However, Incra's president, Rolf Hackbart, rejected the idea of bringing criminal proceedings as \"absurd\" saying that it will only serve to undermine the government's agrarian reforms.</p> <p>Brazil faces two related environmental problems, based on its highly unequal system of land ownership, which means that a tiny elite hold massive estates, while millions remain landless. Increased mechanisation and the spread of cash crops has driven large numbers of these into the Amazon, where they clear land for farming using cash and burn techniques. This, and illegal logging for Brazil's high quality wood, has steadily increased the pressure on the rainforest and is also a major cause of global warming.</p> <p>Under President Lula, Brazil has had some success reversing deforestation in recent years, but this year saw a sharp increase in the levels of destruction. The rising price of food is undoubtedly one of the major reasons for this, but Minc also stressed that it was down to a lack of inspection and enforcement of the law. </p> <p>Hackbart, however, blamed the \"economic model of agriculture\" as the main reason for the destruction. He said that Mato Grosso, one of the states bordering the Amazon, is \"a sea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/dec/20/sciencenews.brazil\">soya</a> and cattle ranches.\" The big farmers are destroying the environment through the production of cash crops and cattle, he said, and pushing smaller farmers into the Amazon. He argued that the crisis needs to be tackled holistically and blaming Incra and the small farmers is to attack the principal victims of the crisis.</p> <p>Minc assumed office two months ago after the resignation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/19/therainforestslastchance\">Marina Silva</a>, a native of the Amazon and an internationally respected campaigner. She had clashed repeatedly with other members of President Lula's government, in particular, Dilma Rousseff, Lula's chief of staff, who is leading its flagship programme for accelerated growth and Roberto Mangabeira Unger, the \"minister for long-term planning\". Although she was a long-time friend and colleague of Lula's, he also sided against her, stressing that the preservation of the Amazon should be \"balanced against economic development and the needs of the people who live there\".</p> <p>Silva had also come up against some entrenched vested interests at the local level and Minc again warned at the weekend that a lack of cooperation by some state governors was a major part of the problem. </p> <p>Brazil's environmentalists have repeatedly criticised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blairo_Maggi\">Blairo Maggi</a>, the governor of Mato Grosso and the world's largest soya bean producer, for being one of the chief causes of the Amazon's destruction. Greenpeace awarded him their <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/soya-king-wins-chainsaw\">Golden Chainsaw Award</a> in 2006.</p> <p>Five years ago Maggi told the new York Times:</p> <blockquote> <p>To me, a 40% increase in deforestation doesn't mean anything at all, and I don't feel the slightest guilt over what we are doing here. We're talking about an area larger than Europe that has barely been touched, so there is nothing at all to get worried about.</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>It was the email every writer dreams about. The subject heading was \"Excellent Book\". And they loved it. Loved it so much they wanted to publish it. Hey, I didn't recognise the name Ilene Yazzie, but that didn't mean anything - it could have been an editor my agent approached.</p> <p>The only trouble is, the email was <a href=\"http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2008/05/victoria-strauss-victory-for-airleaf.html\">a new and cruel form of spam</a>, hidden there among the offers of cheap watches, exhortations to double-check my log-in details for banks I don't hold accounts with, and advice on how to enlarge income and other things. Unlike these other emails, though, this one very nearly tempted me to click on the attachment I knew full well would probably send my computer into meltdown.</p> <p>Spam is designed to intrigue, tempt and push all the right buttons, to make us click on a link that will give some shady online crook access to our hard drives, or unwittingly download a mischief-making virus or worm. The obvious desire for a Rolex and, erm, girth aside, though, this is the first spam I've ever had that spoke directly to me.</p> <p>Ilene's first line had me puffing out my chest: \"Your new book has brought a lot of excitement to our editorial staff. It's certainly this year's best in its genre. You seem to never going to quit surprising us.\"</p> <p>She went on: \"Enclosed is the approved and edited copy of your amazing book. Thank <br>you for this paragon of beauty.\"</p> <p>No, thank <em>you</em>, Ilene. I was almost close to tears by now. There was an attachment on the email - the promised edit. I'm afraid my cursor hovered above it for a second or two, while I looked again at the line that I'd wilfully glossed over: \"We have made a contract with you and guarantee that the first edition will total at least 10m copies.\"</p> <p>I mean, 10m copies..? Not that I don't think my latest effort's worth that, of course, it's just, you know, maybe they should kick of with a slightly smaller first edition\u2026 </p> <p>I didn't really fall for it, of course. But it spoke to me in the language I wanted to hear. It seduced me with its siren song. Whether this is very cleverly targeted spam or just a scattershot approach that figures, hey, every other person and their dog is writing a book, I don't know. But when you've just delivered a novel to your agent and every morning you log on to your emails praying that this time it's done the business, and the massed editors of the British mainstream publishing houses are scrapping for the rights to your book, this is a very cruel and unusual punishment for a writer's shallow vanity.</p>",
  "<p>Homeowners in England will be able to extend their properties without obtaining planning permission under rules coming into force today.</p> <p>The regulations will enable the majority of people to carry out loft conversions and extensions without having to obtain permission from their local council. </p> <p>The government estimates the move will remove the need for around 80,000 households to seek official permission, saving them up to \u00a31,000 in costs.

  "<p>By this stage in the political-electoral cycle it would be reasonable to assume that a coherent international policy would be on offer from the Conservative party. Yet as ambassadors and international observers turn up in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Birmingham</a> they will find prejudice in place of policy and a revival of the worst failures of both John Major's and Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy still embedded in Tory thinking.</p> <p>Compared to 1995 or 1996, when Tony Blair and Robin Cook had completely reshaped Labour's international rhetoric to ditch the Euroscepticism of the 1980s and the hostility to open trade of the Labour left as well as promoting a strong pro-American partnership, today's Tories have not the hard thinking about what to do if they take control of Britain's foreign policy.</p> <p>The latest example is the promise by David Cameron, repeated over the weekend by William Hague, to hold a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4837174.ece\">referendum</a> on the all-but-defunct Lisbon treaty. The Irish no vote could in theory be overcome but even the most pro-EU of Irish observers think that if a second referendum were to be held the Irish no would be even stronger.</p> <p>In 2009, the EU presidency is held first by the Czech Republic then by Sweden. Neither Prague nor Stockholm have ratified the Lisbon treaty nor give much indication they will. Poland's president Kaczynski is also refusing to sign the treaty.</p> <p>Yet Cameron and Hague are insisting on a referendum on a dead parrot. Their cynical tactic is obvious \u2013 to corral the anti-European votes which might go to UKIP or the BNP. But to commit the first year of a putative Tory government to the passage of a referendum bill and then the organisation of a giant fiesta of anti-European hate in which the tabloids, the BNP, UKIP and the Better-Off-Out Tories can indulge into their xenophobic rhetoric seems an odd choice.</p> <p>The no camp will win but only to say no to what is not going to happen. Across Europe and in Washington, partners and allies will look aghast at the frivolity of Britain indulging in such pointless plebiscite politics. And since Cameron cannot deliver what UKIP, Open Europe and many of his MPs want \u2013 a withdrawal of Britain to the status of Norway outside the EU, he will just make Britain's look foolish as Sarkozy and Merkel and other serious centre-right leaders take over the leadership of Europe and marginalise Britain.</p> <p>Cameron's other major foreign policy speech was to denounce the politics of interventionism. The difficulties and controversy over Iraq are well known, but the major theatre of interventionism today is Afghanistan, where Britain and allies are trying to stop Taliban Islamist terrorists win power and in parallel move in for the ultimate al-Qaida and Islamist jihadi goal \u2013 control of Pakistan and a fundamentalist finger on Pakistan's nuclear button. Already the <a href=\"http://www.conservativemuslimforum.com/\">Conservative Muslim Forum</a> has called for support for Iran's drive to get nuclear weapons and has said a Tory government should lessen support for Israel. Is that Cameron's policy?</p> <p>The failure to intervene in the Balkans and Rwanda by John Major remains a blot on British foreign policy. A million asylum seekers left the former Yugoslavia because the Conservatives failed to stand up to and face down Milosevic. Not all interventions work but to rule out interventionism on principle, as Cameron appears to have done takes us back to the worst failures of recent Tory foreign policy.</p> <p>The small \"c\" conservative London establishment of ex-ambassadors are united in their view that Russia's invasion, occupation and dismemberment of Georgia has to be lived with and that, in the words of <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/Russia/article/Reading-Russia-Rewiring-the-West\">Roderic Lyne</a>, a former UK ambassador to Moscow, writing for OpenDemocracy, \"Nato enlargement has been a mistake from the beginning.\" This will strike a chill into the heart of the Poles and the Baltic States. It will also worry the Finns who are now looking seriously at Nato membership to gain extra security after Russia's military assault and establishment of military bases on Georgian territory. Finland, like Georgia won independence in 1918. Stalin snuffed out Georgia's freedom and Finland now worries that Russia wants to dictate the international relations of its close neighbours. David Cameron made a bellicose cold war speech in Tbilisi reminiscent of the more extravagant rightwing anti-Soviet rhetoric of the early Thatcher era but his policy of rejecting cooperation in the fraternity of centre-right governing parties in Europe runs counter to the accepted view that the best way to deal with Russia is to promote an integrated and united EU line on energy policy and on speaking as one to Putin.</p> <p>This week in Strasbourg at the autumn meeting of 600 MPs from 47 nations grouped in the Council of Europe, Cameron's foreign policy will come under pressure. Tory MPs have been backing the Kremlin's efforts to increase influence in Europe's human rights watchdog assembly. Earlier this year, Conservative MPs were promoting a former KGB staffer, now one of Putin's key aides in Russia's parliament, as president of the Council of Europe. Cameron's team back the Russian position on Kosovo against UK, American and EU policy. As with the odd pronouncements of the Conservative Muslim Forum it is not clear if Cameron and Hague actually know what Tory MPs and Peers get up to as representatives of their party at home and abroad.</p> <p>On transatlantic politics, Cameron, Hague and the Tory's defence spokesman, Liam Fox, appear determined to keep the spirit of Dick Cheney alive even as the Bush era becomes history. Both McCain and Obama have spoken of the need for partnership with Europe to tackle world instability. <a href=\"http://www.lordhowell.com/\">David Howell</a>, the Tory spokesman on foreign affairs in the Lords, and father-in-law of George Osborne, has spent the past 15 years writing that America is turning to Asia and is losing interest in Europe.</p> <p>Yet the opposite is the case. Whether on terrorism, on financial crises, on Afghanistan, on Turkey, on missile defence, on opening new bases in the Black Sea, we can see America is more involved with the wider Europe than ever before. When Nato was founded nearly 60 years ago, America worried about a small grouping of nations west of the Elbe. Now from the Caspian to the Atlantic, US interests are ever more co-mingled with Europe. To be sure, the rise of China and India herald a new future, but 60% of world GDP is concentrated in the Euroatlantic region and the Tory incantation that Europe does not matter any more make no sense in Washington or on Wall Street.</p> <p>Next year, the International Labour Organisation celebrates its 90th birthday. But the only available Tory policy on global social justice is the promise to take Britain out of its social charter obligations which have provided British workers with five week's paid holidays a year. As inequality rises to the top of the political agenda, Cameron wants to weaken such modest international work as it exists to promote social justice.</p> <p>The year 2009 also sees the 60th birthday of the Council of Europe which was brought into being by Winston Churchill's famous Zurich speech calling for European unity. Its most important achievement is the European convention on human rights and the setting up of the European court of human rights. But a number of senior Tories have called on Britain to withdraw from the ECHR with its obligation to accept refugees fleeing political and religious persecution. And Conservatives have never liked the rulings of the Council of Europe's human rights court banning violence against children (ie corporal punishment in schools) or upholding women's rights.</p> <p>Next year is also the 60th anniversary of Nato's founding. Today's Nato has to find a way of getting its European members more involved and more willing to share burdens and take risks. Cameron's hostility to European cooperation and party political partnership leaves Britain isolated and unable to influence the future direction of Nato, the EU and the Euroatlantic economic and security community.</p> <p>None of this will be debated at the Conservative conference in Birmingham. Never has a British political party prepared to ask voters to entrust it with government with such a wrongheaded foreign policy, which if implemented along the lines of current Tory rhetoric, would seriously Britain weaken.</p>",
  "<p>We're about five minutes into the current generation of platforms.

And hands up who'd like a better preamble?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>W5 min:ith you in a jiffy, readers. Technical issues afoot ...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Sorted! And best of all, you've missed nothing. Chelsea have been well on top, dominating possession without creating any chanes so far. In fact, the only shot of the game was a wayward one from 30 yards by Cluj's Yssuf Kone after a snappy breakaway.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> There's a proper Cup atmosphere in this boisterous little ground and the crowd created a tremendous din just there as Cluj tore into Chelsea and got many men up for th first time in the match. The party was pooped when Dani wandered offside.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Another shot from the home side, who seem to have decided that romping forward is the best way to keep Bosingwa on the back front - the Portuguese had looked very threatening in the opening few minutes. And now this from Damien Neva: \"if this ends in a draw, the headline tomorrow morning should be CLUJ DRAW BLOOD!\". Um, I don't get that. AM I stupid?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Cluj easily clear a Chelsea corner, which prompts Nick Strada to screech: \"Drogba must have the lowest pain threshold in the history of sport.. I wish we'd sell him and get a striker who won't writhe on the ground for five minutes each time he's challenged. Doesn't he realize that we're playing with ten men each time he goes into one of his little playacting sulks?\" HE hasn't done anything to merit such venom tonight, Nick. Then again, he hasn't done anything at all so far. But I'd be careful what I wished for if I were you: he may be irritating but he's also an awesome player and Chelsea sure won't win the quadruple with Nico Anelka up front all season.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Pereira wins a free-kick with a quite outrageous dive, bringing effusive condemnation from Ballack who, in turn, is castigated by the home fans. The ref waddles over and tells every one to grow up and for once reason prevails. This match is engrossing, with both sides playing at a cracking pace and showing plenty of amibition even if nether has managed to conjure any real chance so far.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> After a jagged run by Malouda, the Frenchman cuts inside and slips the ball to Drogba, who turns past Kone and fires a decent shot wide. \"I 've got my hand up because I want Chelsea to win,\" confesses Joe Clarke. \"And that's not just because I'm a Chelsea fan, it's because ... oh, hold on ... it is because I'm a Chelsea fan.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Mikel records Chelsea's first shot on target, a token effort from 35 yards. \"Matches like this show exactly what's wrong with the CL compared with the old European Cup,\" seethes Gary Naylor (you didn't really think we'd get through a whole match without him, did you?). \"This match should be played in late November, with the snow piled up on the touchlines, the pitch a mixture of greasy and frozen mud, in front of a crowd almost twice the stadium's certificated capacity, officiated by a referee who may or may not have been bought, with Chelsea just 1-0 up from the first leg facing the real possibilty of going out in 90 minutes time. Television executives and Chelsea fans wouldn't like it, but everyone else would.\" You forgot to mention that everyone in the crowd should be in army uniforms, just like the good old days, eh?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Shrieks of excitement in the ground as a cross finds Trica 15 yards from goal and the striker winds up for a spectacular volley \u2026 but misses the ball. Encouraging signs here: Chelsea aren't comfortable. \"Cluj is great great!\" hurrahs Tim Whealn. \"The women are gorgeous! The beer is cheap! It's in Transylvania! Chelsea, on the other hand, is drab! The men are ugly! The beer is expensive and so is everything else! It's in Fulham!\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Wonderful play by Cluj, who are starting to show genuine slickness. They darn near carved Chelsea open up with a smooth four-man move before Terry steetched out a leg to dispossess Kone at the edge of the area. The crowd are loving it</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> It's all Cluj, folks. All that has prevented them from taking the lead \u2013 or at least forcing a decent save from Cech \u2013 is a lack of composure when they get in ithe box. They either rush their shots or run offside. \"So, are Chelsea trying to confuse Cluj by playing both in Romanian national colours (yellowy) and in the Romanian national team style (half-arsed going forward, leaky at the back)?\" burps Richard Whittal. \"Those kits are horrible.\" Have you got something against yellow, Richard? Can we therefore assume that in your eagerness to avoid the sun you have moved to a cave in Lapland?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Drogba holds up a long ball and then spins and attempts to play in Kalou, but overhits his pass.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Pereira gives Bosingwa a taste of his own medicine, bombing past the Portuguese before unleashing a ferocious low drive that fizzed just past the post.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Alex cops an unjust booking for colliding innocently with Kone. Chelsea clear th free-kick no problem. \"If Naylor's going down the nostalgic path, then what we really need is the MBM done in the style of a Peter Jones radio commentary phoned in from the back of the press box,\" muses Simon Thomas. \"What a legend the man was!\" Yes, I remember tuning into him with my tranny. Golly, even that innocent remark could be misconstrued in these complicated times)</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Drogba draws a foul near the right-hand corner flag. As the masses await Lampard's delivery into the box, the Ivorian peels off to the edge and receives Lampard's rehearsed pass ... only to swing and thin air.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Mikel ruins a give-and-go between Perreira and Trica at the rim of th Chelsea box and the visitors set off in search of a goal before the break. Cluj sense the danger and wisely concede a freekick in no-man-'s-land.\"It looks like Chelsea have taken their foot off the Cluj,\" chuckles Oliver Patterson. But is anyone chuckling with him?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Bridge attempts to bustle down the left but Tony has been a dogged defender all night and refuses to let the Englander pass. And on that note, the ref blows for half-time. At this point I imagine Chelsea would settle for a draw; the Transylvanians. meanwhile, will certainly come out in the second half to sink their teeeth even further into their visitors.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Half-time thought, courtesy of Thad Brown.</strong> No, not thad one, Thad one. \"I'm reminded of a song by Paul Westerberg: A dream too tired to come true / Left a rebel without a Cluj / And I'm searching for somethin' to do ... Did Westerberg every get anywhere in England? He barely moved the needle in the US but on his best day he was as good as any ever.\" Well, I never heard of him, Thad. But I'm not particularly Cluj-ed up on these things.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Chelsea have made a change, introducing Anelka for Kalou. Meanwhile, I'm being told by, well, threes of you that I'm most uncool for not knowing Paul Westerberg and his band. What can I say? I've heard of someone else instead of The Replacements.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>48 min: min:</strong> Terry climbs all over Kone to win a header and then shoves the Ivorian right in front of the ref. Taking a leaf out of the FA's book, the ref decides to take an inexcusably lenient view of that. Chelsea were almost punished by Muresan though, but Cech saved the free-kick well.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> A terrifically aggressive and precise tackle by Tony on Anelka brings a lusty roar from the home crowd. \"A couple of quick home goals here and Chelsea will be left clujing at straws,\" snipes Fred Lane, raising the standard of punnery.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Tidy play by Chelsea almost brings a goal, but after a dainty clip-back by Anelka, a valiant defender hurled himself in front of Lampard to divert the shot behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Bridge swings in a rudimentary cross from the left and Drogba connects with it firmly but can't direct it on target.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Wicked low cross by Malouda and a superb by De Sousa who skidded in to whack it clear before Drogba could tap it it home from four yards. Even worse for Chelsea is the fact taht Drogba is now writhing in agony on the pitch - and it looks convincing. Replays show he skewed his ankle (and possibly also his knee) under the challenge. And now a musical lecture from Jake Daniel: \"Westerberg was the genius behind the Replacements, probably the greatest <br>band to ever steal defeat from the jaws of victory. \"Bastards of Young\" would have been a fabulous terrace song.\" And Jake's not finished either. \"Paul would have hated Chelsea. Probably more a Forest supporter -- he's from a provincial city (Minneapolis) where the local teams prospered during the '70s and early '80s when money was less of an issue, but now struggle.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> No doubt that Drogba's injury is serious and another long lay-off surely beckons. With Essien also out, that's bad news for Chelsea and, indeed, football fans everywhere: because those are two wonderful players right there. Scolari underlined the loss by replacing Drogba with Belletti.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> After switching to two up front with the introduction of Anelka at half-time, Chelsea have been forced by Drogba's injury to revert to a lone-striker system, with Ballack providing support of sorts. But it was Lampard who just drew a run-of-the-mill save from the Cluj keeper with a weak shot from 20 yards. And now Robin Hazlehurst would like to scrape the bottom of a very cheap barrel: \"If a Chelsea player mucks up tonight you can accuse him of being as clujless as Inspector Clujseau.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Cadu dawdles at the back and the hyper-alert Anelka almost pounces ... except the even more alert goalkeeper hurtles off the line to stifle the danger.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Cluj are looking less dangerous as Chelsea are cutting their breaks off at source now and starting to gain a stranglehold on the game. Whereas in the first half a shock looked on the cards, now a professional 0-1 is beginning to look more likely. \"The Replacements are a band who directly influence a similar sounding current band called The Hold Steady?\" announces Nathan Smith. \"Ring any bells, or does your musical knowledge only extend as far as the Cheeky Girls?\" The Cheeky Girls are musicians?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> A Lampard corner triggers panic in the Chelsea defence but Alex spares them with a wonky shot well wide. i</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Anelka and Lampard both narrowly fail to get decisive touches on an in-swinging Malouda free-kick. \"I take a bit of issue with Jake's characterization of Minneapolis,\" fumes Andrew Toffley. \"Not so much the provincialism, but the teams haven't necessarily struggled for lack of money. I don't know much about Nottingham as a place, but I'd think Paul would support Wigan - they seem most like the Minnesota Twins. The big question, of course, is who would Frank Sinatra have supported?\" Well, given he was the chairman of Manchester City till recently \u2026 (Chelsea, by the way, are Megadeth, and wish they were Metallica).</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Chelsea change: Malouda off, Franco Di Santo on to make his Champions League debut. I'm guessing that means Chelsea are going back to two up top. \"Lets face it, anything that influenced the Hold Steady can't be good can it?\" guffs Simon Thomas. \"Until that gem, I was tempted to try The Replacements out. Nathan Smith, whoever you are, I thank you for saving me from wasting GBP7.99 and an hour of my life.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Di Santo nearly scores with his first touch, leaping to meet a long throw-in and head jsut wide. Meanwhile, news on Drogba is that he has damaged ligaments and may also have a fracture. Told you he wasn't playacting.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> On a rare Cluj sortie, Culio curls a free-kick into the box but Terry heads comfortably clear.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>78 min: </strong> Alex fluffs a header and almost allows Kone in but Cech surges off his line to the rescue. Moments later Trica flashes a fine long-ranger just wide. Meanwhile, the scores from tonight's other matches have just rolled across my screen and I suppose Shaktar's lead over Barca is the most notable one but I am particularly taken by the news that Anthorosis are 2-1 up against Panathinaikos. The sensational Cypriots have already knocked out one Greek side this season and it would be quite brilliant if they claimed another scalp from them. That's probably not how to advance the cause of Enosis, mind ..</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Nothing wrong with Cluj's fitness levels, that;s for sure. That Trica effort seems to have inspired them to go in search of a winner and they retain enough vim to still unsettle the Chelsea. \"In terms of punning, isn't it a pity that Salamon Caluj has been taken off?\" guffaws Ben Bamford.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Lampard picks out Belletti with a long ball over the top but the Brazilian's first-touch is poor and his second is destitute. Result = the ball high into the stands. \"If Chelsea were a group they'd be Led Zeppelin,\" discloses JM Gaff. \"All of the wags try to refute their greatness but deep in their spirit-starved little hearts they know they're the best. And who's more like Peter Grant than Big Phil?\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Ooooooohhhhh! Marvelous interplay by Cluj, Perreira instigated it and nearly completed it but, after a delightful one-two, Cech parried his powerful shot from a difficult angle. And the subsequent corner was rubbish.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Chelsea's best chance of the game is squandered by Anelka, who sought to control Bridge's cross rather than just smash it into the net from six yards. His control was as bad as his decision.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Kone wins a corner for Cluj and the crowd are delirious ... at least they were until Culio walloped the corner into them.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>90+ 1 min:</strong> The ref reveals there will be only two minutes of time added on, which is odd considering how long Drogba was down for earlier on.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Lampard arrives late at the edge of the box to whack a swerver just wide. And with that, the ref blows for full-time, bringing hearty cheers from the proud home crowd. \"If Chelsea were a group they would be Coldplay,\" says Brad Brooks. \"Boring but do a job.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Good night and thank you</strong></p>",
  "<p>I'm a huge Kelsey Grammer fan, and I'm a massive Frasier freak. There, I've said it. As such, over the years I've forgiven the big man for his numerous transgressions; the biggest, undoubtedly, being his jaw-dropping, unflinching support for the Republican party, leading to him being a guest at George W's first inauguration, as well as backing Rudi Giuliani, then McCain for president. He even counts Ann Coulter as a personal friend for crying out loud. Up until now, I've always stood by the \"Wagner defence\" - after all, as someone once said, \"Genius can inhabit the most ordinary of men.\" However, in deciding to take part in the what will be the undoubtedly woeful An American Carol (see the trailer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CYSGCoflAA\">here</a>), this time he's gone too far. </p> <p>Directed by one-time Democrat supporter, now staunch Republican David Zucker (Airplane!, Naked Gun), An American Carol (released in the US on October 3) is essentially a rightwing hatchet job on Michael Moore and, on the strength of the trailer, a not particularly funny one at that. Even Grammer, who plays General George S Patton in the film, won't be able to save it, for the simple reason \u2013 for which I can't forgive him \u2013 that it's propaganda masquerading as entertainment. </p> <p>Moore is undoubtedly fair game to be parodied; despite agreeing with most of his arguments I find his unsubtle, sledgehammer style and obvious love of the limelight offputting. But good satire has to be non-partisan (see Team America); otherwise, as with An American Carol, the subject of mockery is merely a vehicle to awkwardly and patronisingly ram home a message \u2013 in this case, the message that the Iraq war was justified, and anyone in disagreement (ie lily-livered liberals) is unpatriotic and doesn't deserve the right to call themselves American. At one point, \"America's most infamous film-maker\" Michael Malone (Kevin Farley in a baseball cap, flak jacket and carrying stubble and lots of weight) says: \"I love America \u2013 that's why it needs to be destroyed.\" Mmm, subtle.</p> <p>Ten years ago, such a brazenly rightwing film would never have got made, so An American Carol's significance cannot be underestimated \u2013 it is concrete proof that Grammer's Republican stance is, worryingly, increasingly becoming less and less odd for Hollywood's elite. </p> <p>Not so long ago, Hollywood's most vocal and politically active appeared to be exclusively Democratic party stalwarts, such as power couple Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, and the walking ego that is Sean Penn. They haven't gone away by any means (Sarandon recently likened Barack Obama to Jesus Christ, and vowed to leave the US if McCain got in), but the balance is being redressed. For example, that the great actors James Woods and John Voight also appear in An American Carol is undoubtedly down to some ill-judged rightwing solidarity on their part (both are hardcore Republicans). Oh, and Dennis Hopper's in it as well. </p> <p>Perhaps it's some kind of perverse Schwarzenegger effect; other conservative Hollywood big-hitters making their views known include Sylvester Stallone, Robert Duvall, Adam Sandler, The Rock and, um, Chuck Norris \u2013 all of whom have openly and actively supported Republican candidates. So, given the mainstream appeal of these examples (save perhaps for Duvall), the question is this: is the Hollywood right really capable of influencing which way people will vote in November's election? Because that certainly seems to be the hope, if not the belief, of Zucker and co.</p>",
  "<p>A Conservative government will seek to make Britain the \"most family-friendly place to do business\", shadow women's minister Theresa May pledged last night.</p> <p>May cast the modern Conservatives as a party that accepted that \"families today come in all sorts of shapes and sizes\" who needed greater choice to better balance their work and home lives. </p> <p>And she vowed to champion the pay gap between men and women as she announced that the Conservatives would introduce a private members bill in December that would strengthen the law against pay discrimination, which sees women earning on average 17% less than men. </p> <p>\"We're calling for cross-party support because this issue isn't about political point-scoring,\" she told the Conservative party conference. \"It should cross party lines. This is about treating women fairly.\"</p> <p>May took part in a debate on the family yesterday afternoon in which she highlighted the changing needs of modern Britons.</p> <p>\"The problems they face have changed and we must adapt our policies to make that principle work in today's world,\" she told party conference delegates.</p> <p>May sought to explode the myths around flexible working, which she insisted \"isn't some woolly liberal politically correct policy thought up by a focus group\".</p> <p>She highlighted the various needs for flexible working, from families who needed a second income to make ends meet, to pensioners who needed to work beyond retirement because of meagre pensions.</p> <p>Younger people also had a different view of the boundaries between work and home, May explained. </p> <p>\"They expect to be able to vary their hours at work, but they might also do work from home late into the evening. Technology makes this easy. Today's generation demand more flexibility in how they work and in the workplace.\"</p> <p>One key myth was that flexible working was only ever costly and bad for business.</p> <p>\"That flies in the face of the facts,\" said May. \"Studies have shown that those employers who use flexible working benefit from better retention, better productivity and a happier workforce.\"</p> <p>She added: \"There doesn't have to be a conflict between helping business and helping people. We need a revolution in the workplace, accepting that it's not just mothers who want to spend more time with their children but fathers too.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives announced at their spring conference plans to allow 52 weeks parental leave that couples can split between them as they see fit. </p> <p>The party has also promised to extend flexible working to all parents with children under 18. </p> <p>May said: \"If the culture of the modern workplace could adapt to accommodate the culture of the modern life then I believe we could all benefit.

We want this type of support for couples to be routine in Britain too.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's a very exciting week for me: my latest book, It's All Greek To Me, is published tomorrow, and today <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/oct/01/philosophy.history\">the Guardian has printed an extract</a>.</p> <p>The book is a product of a long love affair with the literature of ancient Greece. Writing it was one of the most joyous and enriching projects I have ever had the good fortune to undertake. </p> <p>What underpins the book is my profound belief that the great writers of Greece \u2013 such as Homer and Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle, Sophocles and Sappho \u2013 are not worthy-but-dull, forbidding authors of dusty, unreadable tomes. These authors have left us vivid, exciting, provocative, often devastating, often hilarious reads. They should be as widely enjoyed as Jane Austen or Charles Dickens \u2013 and it saddens me that they are not.</p> <p>The storytelling of Homer \u2013 whose humanity, whose deep understanding of love and loss is utterly unmistakable \u2013 is unmatched, for my money, in later literature. Plato's Republic (more often discussed than read cover-to-cover) is one of the most terrifying, challenging and bold thought experiments ever to have been dreamed up \u2013 and you certainly don't need to be a professional philosopher to be gripped by it. The dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides still lay down a ridiculously high standard for playwrights today \u2013 which is why directors and actors keep returning to them. <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/oedipus\">Oedipus the King</a> opens at the National Theatre in a couple of weeks \u2013 aside from being an almost perfect play in terms of the relentless logic of its structure, it is also the world's first detective story, one in which the detective and the perpetrator, horrifyingly, turn out to be the same person.</p> <p>I was just now reading our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books\">Books site</a>'s excellent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2008/sep/29/hart.crane.poem.of.the.week\">poem of the week</a>, and I was thinking about which poem of Sappho I would put in that slot, and why. Well, I'll finish this post with another little chunk of the book: a few words about Sappho's fragment two.</p> <p>\"... Of her wonderful poems of love and longing, many are unambiguously homoerotic; some are wedding songs. Part of their appeal is their very fragmentary quality: these beautiful lines and half-lines are like finely decorated potsherds, separated for ever from their fellows \u2013 they act as a poignant metaphor, perhaps, of the study of the ancient world itself, the way we try to make a world from beautiful scraps and bits. In fact there is a (part) poem of hers which was actually discovered written on a potsherd; fragment two, as it is known:</p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;down from the mountain top<br>and out of Crete,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;come to me here<br>in your sacred precinct, to your grove<br>of apple trees,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;and your altars<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;smoking with incense,</p> <p>where cold water flows babbling<br>through the branches,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;the whole place<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;shadowed with roses,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;sleep adrift down<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;from silvery leaves<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;an enchantment</p> <p>horses grazing in a meadow<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;abloom with spring flowers<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; and where the breezes blow sweetly,<br> <br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;here, Cypris,<br>delicately in golden cups<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;pour nectar<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;mixed for our festivities.</p> <p>[Translation: Stanley Lombardo] </p> <p>It is an invocation, a summoning of the goddess Aphrodite, named here for Cyprus, the island off which she was born from the foam of the sea. It's astonishingly powerful, this evocation of place, this apple grove in which the love-goddess's sanctuary lies. It's synaesthesic, almost, every sense is stimulated: there's the heady scent of the incense; the sight of the stream (in the background) with the shading apple trees in front; the icy coldness to the touch of the water; the drowsy sound of the breeze through the leaves; beyond, the glimpse of the horses grazing in the flower-filled meadows. To read this poem is to be there, lying in the deep grass of the grove, gently heading for sleep ...\"</p>",
  "<p>As a theatre critic you are frequently packed off to review shows that weren't designed for you. It's part of the job to cover children's shows, boulevard comedies, West End <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/musicals\">musicals</a>, community plays and any number of events which in other circumstances you'd never have chosen to see. This makes you something of a cultural anthropologist, commenting not simply on the traffic of the stage, but on the context in which the performance takes place.<br> This is generally a good thing. Your position as an outsider helps in making a less partial analysis of the event. Music fans often write letters to the editor arguing their favourite band should have been reviewed by a fan, an argument that misses the point that, while the insight of the enthusiast can be illuminating, it is the disinterested observer who is the more reliable witness. Except it isn't as clear-cut as that. As far as your personal taste goes, art in real life is a sliding scale ranging from the familiar to the alien. If I were to distinguish between Edinburgh's Traverse and Pitlochry's Festival theatre, for example, I'd say the former was for people like me and the latter for a more conservative crowd. Yet check out the current production of David Greig's <a href=\"http://www.pitlochry.org.uk/page13.php?id=31&amp;month=2008-09-01\">Outlying Islands</a> at Pitlochry and you'll see it narrowly has the edge over the original Traverse staging. It's my kind of play aimed at another kind of theatregoer.<br> This sort of thing means the job of reviewing requires a continual process of readjustment and negotiation as you take into account each new set of circumstances and your own changing biases. Very occasionally, however, you come across a piece of work that is so precisely targeted at your own demographic that you realise your reactions are likely to be entirely idiosyncratic. What little hope you might have had for critical objectivity goes out the window. It happened to me this week in my home town of Liverpool with <a href=\"http://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/show-detail.asp?id=217\">Eric's</a>, a musical inspired by the short-lived late-70s night club through which Ian McCulloch, Julian Cope and Pete Wylie passed before forming Echo and the Bunnymen, the Teardrop Explodes and Wah! Heat respectively. Although those bands all went on to produce hit singles, we are hardly in Mamma Mia! territory. Much of the material is downright arcane, especially given that many in the audience were not even born at the time. <br> I was very much alive, however, and although I was too young to visit the club, the play's very particular cultural reference points are particularly mine - so much so that I'm half convinced I didn't see Mark Davies Markham's show at all and that it just came to me in a dream. For this reason, I have sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/sep/26/theatre\">Alfred Hickling</a> when he concludes \"you probably had to be there\". <br> Unless you spent your formative years listening to Wilder by the Teardrop Explodes, you are highly unlikely to regard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PBhVJrXnuY\">Tiny Children</a> (side two, track two) as a virtual showstopper. The significance of having Echo and the Bunnymen's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrInyKYETA8\">Rescue</a> as a musical motif will be lost on most people, but to initiates such as me it's as thrilling as it is weird. As far as I'm concerned, any show featuring a mash-up of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKx2KtQ1uig\">The Story of the Blues</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX1PwkgwsG0\">The Killing Moon</a> can do no wrong, but I've no reason to suppose anyone else would feel the same way (although the show is going down well with audiences).<br> As with Annie Griffin's <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/feature.jsp?id=148104\">Festival</a> - a film that captures so much of my 20 years experience living in Edinburgh that it feels like it was made with me in mind - I'm glad I don't have to review Eric's. The only way to do it would be to declare my bias and hope someone would understand what I'm going on about. Quite how Mark Davies Markham persuaded the theatre to take it on is another question, but all power to him for succeeding.</p>",
  "<p>Express Newspapers has provided staff on the <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media/dailyexpress\">Daily Express</a> and <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media/sundayexpress\">Sunday Express</a> with details of its proposal for reporters to input stories directly into page templates, as up to 80 subeditors across the titles are made redundant.</p> <p>In an email to staff, the Express Newspapers group managing editor, Ian Parrott, detailed how reporters would fit stories into an editorial template containing the necessary styles. Rewriters and lawyers would then check the pages.</p> <p>A section of the email memo, seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk, called \"Changing Ways of Working\", outlined the proposed changes to workflow at the newspapers after the introduction of the Woodwing editorial system.</p> <p>However, staff remain concerned about the new system. The Express NUJ chapel reached a resolution last week calling on the management to give full and proper information on the proposals.</p> <p>The memo said that despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/10/dailyexpress.richarddesmond\">the planned redundancies of up to 80 staff, including all casual production staff</a>, there would be \"around 26 highly responsible roles for former subeditors\". A team of \"rewriters\" would then be organised into two distinct groups, news and sport, with staff expected to cover all areas within in each section.</p> <p>\"The loss of revenues means inevitable cost cuts to ensure our long-term survival,\" Parrott wrote.</p> <p>\"We are therefore proposing to introduce the direct input of copy by reporters and writers into the system. Pages would be envisaged by the backbench and drawn by the designers as now. The reporters would be sent a shape for the stories, containing all the necessary type and styles and they would fit their copy to that shape. <br> \"Once finished, the reporters/writers would check in their story shape and the words would be edited by the newsdesk and a team of rewriters/editors who would also write the headlines and make any necessary changes. Our night lawyers would check the stories as they do at present.</p> <p>\"As a consequence, we also plan to lose all our current casuals in production in London plus a number of people who support production such as those who act as messengers.</p> <p>\"We also propose that all staff would work a five-day week, as already operated by the newsdesk, reporters and feature writers. </p> <p>\"These efficiencies are vital to the secure future of the Daily and Sunday Express in a very challenging period.</p> <p>\"We are discussing with the NUJ the shift rotas that we will need to work and how work will change to achieve the improvements we want. We are determined not to reduce the quality of our papers by these changes.\"</p> <p>The proposal comes as the two newspapers plan to axe more than 80 subeditors and casual staff, which - it is understood - will include more than half the two papers' permanent staff subeditors.</p> <p>Management is in consultations with the NUJ over the planned redundancies.</p> <p>When the cuts were announced three weeks ago, the NUJ chapel at Express Newspapers said the cuts would lead to the title's \"immediate demise as national papers\" and passed a resolution saying it opposed redundancies with \"anger\".</p> <p>Staff at Express Newspapers proprietor Richard Desmond's other national papers, the Daily Star and the Daily Star Sunday, are not affected, nor are employees at the company's subbing centre at Broughton in the north-west and the group's office in Glasgow.</p> <p>Express Newspapers had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>We now have only 98 months before the world enters a new, more perilous phase of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">global warming</a>, and that's if we are lucky. Glaciers around the world may be increasing their rate of retreat, but something else is also beginning to move. When was the last time you can recall a former American vice-president calling on the youth of the world to commit widespread acts of civil disobedience?</p> <p>The Bush administration's ad hoc disregard of international law may be familiar, but the audience did a double take when <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE48N78A20080924\">Al Gore</a>, speaking in New York in September, surprised the next generation by telling them to rip up the domestic rule book. </p> <p>He called it \"stock fraud\" when fossil fuel companies create the impression to potential investors that climate change shouldn't make them think twice before buying shares.</p> <p>\"I believe we have reached the stage,\" said Gore, \"where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.\"</p> <p>His comments followed the extraordinary emergence in the UK of case law that is beginning to legitimate previously illegal environmental direct action.</p> <p>Six Greenpeace campaigners were brought to trial last month facing damage claims. They climbed a chimney at the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in an attempt to close it down (declaration of interest \u2013 I am on the board of Greenpeace UK), getting as far as daubing the word \"Gordon\" on the smokestack before an injunction stopped them finishing off with the words \"bin it\".</p> <p>But at the trial, the jury refused to convict them after hearing expert witness evidence on the threat of climate change. They accepted the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">lawful excuse</a>\" defence, which allows property to be damaged if it is done in the name of preventing damage to property elsewhere. </p> <p>The occasion was symbolic because Kingsnorth is the focus of a debate about whether or not the government will allow a new wave of coal-fired power stations. At the Labour party conference, the business secretary, John Hutton, scaremongered that Britain's lights would go out if they were not built. And in his keynote speech, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for a new generation of \"clean coal\" plants.</p> <p>Speaking almost simultaneously in the US, Al Gore stated explicitly: \"Clean coal does not exist.\" The energy cognoscenti will be aware that there is a term for one of the most polluting types of fossil fuel \u2013 it is \"brown coal\".</p> <p>But while one legal tide seemed to be turning last month, we discovered that another was rising in a far more worrying fashion.</p> <p>The biosphere \u2013 our oceans, forests, fields and atmosphere \u2013 is, in reality, the global economy's parent company. It can only produce so many resources and absorb so much waste each year. But, measured using the ecological footprint \u2013 a conservative assessment of our rates of consumption and waste production \u2013 since the mid-1980s, humanity has been overshooting available biocapacity, running up an ecological debt.</p> <p>Demand on nature's services is exceeding supply. Taking a typical calendar year, the date at which humanity goes into the environmental red has been creeping ever forward. Comparing like with like (the data sources and methodology are continually being improved), this year the world ran into ecological debt on September 23, five days earlier than last year. </p> <p>Considering that it took governments in the UK and US just a week to drop decades of hardened economic practice to save the financial system (a subsidiary of the environment) from meltdown, nationalising banks at great public expense, we should be asking why it takes any longer to act to save the planet from runaway warming.</p> <p>With talk of new runways and coal-fired power stations, the government is engaged in the environmental equivalent of promoting unguaranteed sub-prime mortgages with no credit checks and telling banks with no assets to keep lending. </p> <p>While the potentially irreversible environmental damage of such developments is familiar, the economic value is increasingly under question. Following doubts raised by voices as diverse as the former government chief scientific adviser, David King, and the Cooperative Bank, a new report last month called <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/z_sys_PublicationDetail.aspx?pid=261\">Plane Truths</a> from the World Development Movement and my own organisation, nef, questioned the economic value of aviation growth to both rich and poor countries alike. At least, reportedly, the cabinet ministers Hilary Benn and David Miliband are opposing new coal plants that are not capable of capturing and safely storing their own emissions. </p> <p>From overheated economies in meltdown, to an overheating planet with melting icecaps, it's now 98 months and counting \u2026</p>"
