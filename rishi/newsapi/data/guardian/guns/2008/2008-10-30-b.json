  "<p>Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, has asked the attorney general to investigate possible \"criminal wrongdoing\" by the MI5 and the CIA over its treatment of a British resident held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, it was revealed tonight.</p> <p>The dramatic development over allegations of collusion in torture and inhuman treatment follows a high court judgment which found that an MI5 officer participated in the unlawful interrogation of Binyam Mohamed. The MI5 officer interrogated Mohamed while he was being held in Pakistan in 2002.</p> <p>It emerged tonight that lawyers acting for Smith have sent the attorney general, Baroness Scotland, evidence about MI5 and CIA involvement in the case, which was heard behind closed doors in high court hearings. In a letter seen by the Guardian, they have asked Scotland - as an independent law officer - to investigate \"possible criminal wrongdoing\". The move could lead to a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>The evidence was suppressed following gagging orders demanded by David Miliband, the foreign secretary, and the US authorities. The action by Smith, the minister responsible for MI5 activities, is believed to be unprecedented.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman confirmed tonight that the letter and closed evidence had been sent to the attorney. It had no further comment.</p> <p>Tonight Clive Stafford Smith, director of the legal charity Reprieve, which represents Guant\u00e1namo detainees, welcomed the move. He said: \"This is a welcome recognition that the CIA cannot just go rendering British residents to secret torture chambers without any consequences, and British agents cannot take part in American crimes without facing the music\".</p> <p>He added: \"Reprieve will be making submissions to the attorney general to ensure that those involved in these crimes \u2013 from the US, Pakistan, Morocco, Britain, and elsewhere \u2013 are held responsible.\"</p> <p>Richard Stein of Leigh Day, which is acting for Mohamed in the British courts, said: \"Ultimately the British government had little choice in the matter, once they conceded that a case had been made out that Binyam Mohamed was tortured.\"</p> <p>\"The Convention Against Torture rightly imposes an obligation on signatory states to investigate cases of torture, and we look forward to a full and open airing of the crimes committed against Mr Mohamed and a thorough investigation by the Police and Crown Prosecution Service into this case.\"</p> <p>Reprieve has argued that the case against Mohamed should be dropped by the US government, and that he should be returned to the UK, as the British government requested in August 2007. It says Mohamed is a victim of \"extraordinary rendition\" and torture.</p> <p>They claim that all the evidence against him was the \"fruit of torture\". Mohamed was seized in Pakistan and later secretly rendered to Morocco, Afghanistan, and then to the US base in Cuba. He claims that while in Morocco he was tortured by having his penis sliced with a razor.</p> <p>In the high court earlier this month, Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones condemned as \"deeply disturbing\" a refusal by the US to disclose evidence. In a particularly damning passage, they said claims by Mohamed's lawyers that the US was refusing to release the papers because \"torturers do not readily hand over evidence of their conduct\" could not be dismissed and required an answer.</p> <p>Charges against Mohamed - including that he was involved in a dirty bomb plot - have been dropped, allegedly to prevent the US from revealing torture evidence. The US authorities now planned to charge him with other offences, the judges noted.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Binyam Mohamed, 30, an Ethiopian national who worked in London as a janitor, was held in Pakistan in 2002, where he was interrogated by an unidentified MI5 officer. The CIA secretly rendered him to Morocco. The US flew him to Afghanistan, where he was held incognito before being flown to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in September 2004, where he remains. In 2007, the British government asked that he should be released. The US refused and said he must be tried by a special military commission in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In court hearings in Britain, David Miliband, the foreign secretary, has said that documents believed to show Mohamed was tortured must not be released because the US wants to keep the evidence secret. The US has warned that if the UK courts ordered the release of the documents, America might stop sharing intelligence with Britain. MI5 was involved in Mohamed's interrogation in Pakistan, where the high court says he was held unlawfully.<br><strong>Richard Norton-Taylor</strong></p>",
  "<p>Last week I mentioned Nokia's <a href=\"http://www.gamingchallenge.org/\">Gameing Innovation Challenge</a> in which mobile developers were invited to submit their wackiest concepts for the chance to win a publishing deal and 40,000 euros toward development costs. The three finalists got to show off their wares at the Nokia Game Summit yesterday, and during a rain and wind swept evening event at the stunning Castel Sant D'Angelo (in which we were almost blown off the balcony by a collapsing gazebo) the winning title was announced. I had a chat with all the entrants, and if you're at all interested in the new direction Nokia wants to take mobile games, here's the lowdown on the three titles\u2026<br><br>Ghost Wire, by the accurately named Swedish studio, <a href=\"http://www.differentgame.org/\">A Different Game</a>, was the eventual winner of the top prize. It's a ghost hunting sim inspired by TV shows like Most Haunted, but based around a Pokemon-style collection dynamic. Players must locate and capture 40 different ghosts, some easy to find, others much more rare. The thing is, there's no onscreen game world \u2013 instead it's an augmented reality-style experience in which your phone display becomes a ghost-tracking device, which you must tune in to the spectral frequency and start grabbing spooks. </p> <p>Ghost Wire fully integrates with your mobile clock, so some ghosts will only appear at certain times, or on specific days of the week. Cleverly, others will only materialise if you are completely silent \u2013 the game utilises your handset's microphone, so you'll need to shut yourself in a very quiet room. In a nod to Sixth Sense, every ghost has a problem that you need to solve via a dialogue-driven interface (Tom S\u00f6derlund of Different Game name-checked Monkey Island as an inspiration here) \u2013 some have become separated from loved ones, others require you to unite them with certain objects. I'm not sure how this element is going to work, but, again, it sounds very much like the Pokemon titles.</p> <p>When a spectre becomes available for capture, Ghost Wire has another technological convergence trick up its sleeve. You need to switch on your phone's camera display, and the ghost will appear, transparent and hauntingly abstract on the screen, as though hovering in real-life, right in front of you \u2013 a really quite spooky effect. S\u00f6derlund told me the idea with the game was to make players believe the ghosts were really there. </p> <p>The runner up was Melokey from fellow Swedes, <a href=\"http://www.jadestone.se/\">Jadestone</a>, a rhythm action-style game with some interesting riffs on the genre. It begins as a sort of musical RPG. You play a music student who must learn various instruments and playing techniques from different masters, before auditioning for bands and eventually becoming a fully-fledged pop star. In typical music game style, there are a number of licensed tracks and during a music session you must hit the right keys at the right times to play along. </p> <p>However, according to the dev team, the system is slightly more flexible \u2013 as in WII Music, you're not punished for missing beats. Also there's a free play mode, which allows you to choose an instrument and just create your own tunes \u2013 it's even possible to build chords and assign them to hot keys, so you're not having to jam your fingers on multiple buttons. Friends can then get together, select different instruments and have their onw mini-jam sessions. And as in Wii Music it should also be possible to upload your tunes to the web.</p> <p>The last of Nokia's Innovation finalists was Watcher by Manchester studio, <a href=\"http://www.eclipseinteractive.co.uk/\">Eclipse</a>. This is an alternative reality conspiracy drama incorporating just about every trendy mobile/web 2.0 technology going. Though there's no discernible plot yet, it looks like players will need to check websites and fictional Facebook profiles for clues, then go outside to hunt down leads in the real world. Director of Marketing, Ann Garner, talked about players being able to geo-tag specific locations with clues or disinformation, so that passing competitors/collaborators can pick up on game content when they're out and about. </p> <p>There are also plans for a community-generated narrative element \u2013 Eclipse want the players to start dictating the story through their actions \u2013 there's talk about a branching plot, delivered in episodic chunks. At the moment, it sounds like a jumble of trendy technology features, without a cogent design or game implementation, but it's definitely worth looking out for \u2013 especially as Garner referred to the game as 'X-files meets Coronation Street'.</p>",
  "<p>Every dawn, as the day's first light filters into the sky over the English Channel, small convoys of fishing boats leave the ports of the south coast. To most inhabitants of the region's bustling towns, the fishing industry is practically invisible. Yet while less profitable than the fisheries of the North Sea, Cornwall, and Scotland, men still ply their trade in these waters as they have done for thousands of years. How much longer they'll be doing this however, is a moot point. Current fisheries policy is putting many fishermen's livelihoods under threat.</p> <p>The fleet here is dominated by inshore boats. Less than 10 metres in length, these vessels rarely venture beyond 10 miles from the coast to catch species like sole, cuttlefish, plaice, cod, bass and lobster. The boats are constrained in what they can land by their size and the power of their engines, and their owners employ fishing methods such as set-nets, traps, and lines that according to the Marine Stewardship Council <a href=\"http://www.fishonline.org/caught_at_sea/methods/Fishing_Methods_League_Table.pdf\">minimise impact</a> on the marine habitat. Perversely however, it is these fishermen that are falling victim to an unfair quota system. The local cod fishery is a case in point.</p> <p>Cod stocks have undergone an unexpected rise in British waters in the last two years. Yet along the entire coast from Kent to Dorset, boats of under 10m are not permitted to land a single cod. This is because by February of this year, the boats had reached their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/25/fishing.food\">combined quota</a> for 2008 of just 55 tons. While these fishermen can continue to target other fish, they are required by law to return every cod, usually the most abundant and profitable species in the colder months, to the water. Most are dead. The larger fishing vessels and trawlers meanwhile, are free to hunt cod with impunity, as their quota allocations have not been reached. It is a similar story around Britain.</p> <p>Each year the major share of the fish and shellfish quota across the country is allocated to the powerful boats over 10 metres in length that make up just a quarter of the total fleet. And for some valuable fish just 3% of the quota is reserved for the 2,500 inshore fishing boats that make up the remaining 75% of the fleet. That the minority of boats are awarded the bulk of the permitted catch is bad enough. The fact that the fishing methods employed by the larger vessels are hugely destructive \u2013 chief among which are bottom trawling and dredging \u2013 makes it a scandal.</p> <p>Bottom trawling takes many forms but invariably involves dragging often vast nets weighted down by rollers and thick chains along the sea-bed. Dredging is similar but uses metal cages to sieve bivalves such as scallops out of the sediment. The impact of these methods has parallels with the clear-cut felling of the world's forests, killing marine life indiscriminately and leaving huge scars in the sea-bed (http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oceans/problems/bottom-trawling). It is hugely wasteful destruction.</p> <p>According to the World Wide Fund for Nature some trawlers in the North Sea kill 7kg of marine animals to produce just 450g of marketable Dover sole. That's a by-catch rate of over 90% and most of that surplus, which includes juvenile fish and unprofitable species, is returned dead to the water. Add to this the fact that these vessels <a href=\"http://assets.panda.org/downloads/fishdishreportfinal150906.pdf\">consume</a> on average more than 2,000 litres of fuel for every tonne of flatfish landed and it paints a picture of a practice that is outdated and unsustainable. Yet rather than phasing out such fishing methods the current quota system actually encourages them at the expense of the smaller boats.</p> <p>The industrialisation of the fishing fleet has caused huge and possibly irreversible damage to our seas. It has benefited just a few wealthy trawler owners while forcing countless fishermen from the industry and leaving many coastal areas facing economic decline. The sea has always been one of Britain's greatest resources and if it is to remain so, this trend must be reversed. The solution to the problem is clear.</p> <p>From 2009 inshore boats should be allocated a greater share of the overall quota, with this increasing on a year-on-year basis. Such a policy would benefit fishermen who by necessity utilise more ecologically sensitive fishing practices, and encourage those who don't to switch. Furthermore, the smallest of the inshore boats whose impact on fish stocks are negligible should be exempt from quotas entirely, making the whole system easier to police. </p> <p>The positive news is that policy makers are beginning to think along these lines. Currently under consideration at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is a proposal to create a new class of vessel under 6m which could operate outside the quota system. If introduced, such legislation would do much to tempt fishermen away from their trawlers.</p> <p>By encouraging the British fleet to downsize, the government will effectively phase out the use of the most destructive and wasteful fishing practices. Only this can guarantee the health of the marine environment while ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. In the meantime however, many inshore fishermen continue to struggle. Those on the south coast have been denied their principal seasonal income, and with living costs rising and wholesale fish prices falling, they face a long bleak winter while the sea they rely on continues to be blighted.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC director general, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/markthompson\">Mark Thompson</a>, has warned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a> that he is on a \"final warning\" following his 12-week suspension from the corporation over the Sachsgate affair.</p> <p>Thompson also admitted that BBC Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas, who resigned over the \"Sachsgate\" affair, had not heard the controversial episode of the Russell Brand show before it went to air on October 18 with the presenter and Ross's pre-recorded lewd prank calls to Andrew Sachs.</p> <p>\"I believe that Jonathan absolutely overstepped the mark [but] it doesn't mean that Jonathan can't continue to broadcast on the BBC in the future,\" Thompson told BBC News channel.</p> <p>\"But I believe that he and everyone else would regard this as a final warning.\"</p> <p>Thompson also said ultimate responsibility for the BBC's output rested with \"executive producers, producers and controllers\" rather than presenters.</p> <p>In this case it is a controller - Douglas - who has borne responsibility for the controversy, along with presenter Brand. But it appears that Ross - for the moment - will keep his job.</p> <p>Thompson admitted that Douglas had not actually heard the controversial October 18 broadcast - in which Ross and Brand left lewd messages on Sachs' answer machine - before it went to air.</p> <p>\"It was her decision to resign. What Lesley has said to me is that she feels as controller of Radio 2 in overall responsibility for editorial standards on Radio 2,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This was a failure of those standards. I would not say that Lesley was fully personally responsible.\"</p> <p>But pressed as to who was responsible for clearing the programme to go on air, Thompson said he was still investigating the matter.</p> <p>\"We now have a pretty good picture of what happened. We still have some people to interview,\" he added.</p> <p>\"Lesley was aware of the programme and believed that a proper compliance programme was taking place but it wasn't. </p> <p>\"I think it is fair to say she did not hear the programme before transmission.\"</p> <p>Thompson said he had spoken to Ross and believed his personal apology to Sachs was \"heartfelt\".</p> <p>He said the incident was not a failure of the compliance processes he had put in place in the wake of the fake phone-in winners exposed on the BBC last year.</p> <p>\"This incident was not a failure of our systems. Our systems rely on the judgment of producers ... this was a failure of judgement,\" Thompson added.</p> <p>\"I believe in the matter of competitions and fair dealing with the audience we have tightened up.\"</p> <p>However, Thompson's view appears to be at odds with the BBC Trust's line on the Sachsgate affair.</p> <p>The BBC Trust said in a strongly worded statement on the affair today that \"editorial control and compliance procedures in non news areas of the BBC's audio and music department are inadequate and need to be strengthened\".</p> <p>Asked whether he could afford anything like this episode to happen again, Thompson replied: \"I have worked for the BBC for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>\"Given the scale of the BBC's output it is inevitable in my view that from time to time programmes will encounter difficulties [and] people with the best of intentions will make wrong editorial judgements.</p> <p>\"We have to minimise the number of times this happens, and the severity.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>A team of 5,000 volunteer lawyers representing the Democrats will fan out across polling stations in Florida next Tuesday to ensure that the Republicans do not \"steal\" the election as - Democrats claim - George Bush did eight years ago.</p> <p>Heading the biggest team of lawyers ever assembled is Charles Lichtman, a partner in the Fort Lauderdale law firm Berger Singerman, who has been working as an unpaid volunteer for up to 18 hours a day since August.</p> <p>His drive comes from the experience of being what he describes as \"the Hanging Chad Guy\", heading up a team of lawyers based in infamous Broward county for weeks during the 2000 recount.</p> <p>\"Legitimate votes of citizens did not get counted. If they had been counted, we would not have been in Iraq and the economy would not have tanked,\" Lichtman, who is 53 and is originally from Chicago, said. </p> <p>He vowed at the time that he would do his best to ensure it never happened again and began planning the operation that will be in place on November 4.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team has recruited thousands of volunteer lawyers to man polling stations in the battleground states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and other states where the vote could be close. </p> <p>But the biggest push is in Florida, in part because of its history and in part because polls suggest the vote will be tight.</p> <p>The lawyers will be on hand to help any voters denied a ballot on spurious grounds or fight to keep polling stations open late if they become overwhelmed by the expected turnout.</p> <p>The Republicans will have their own lawyers across Florida too.</p> <p>So far, Lichtman said that there have been no serious problems, other than long queues - with waits of two hours or more - as people take advantage of the early voting that has been in place for the last two weeks.</p> <p>\"The only issue is the long lines but I think that is a good thing. It shows an enthusiasm for democracy. It is a great problem to have,\" Lichtman said. He was not anticipating any major legal challenges from the Republican side.</p> <p>An Obama campaign worker in Florida, who requested anonymity because he signed a pledge not to speak to the press, agreed that Republicans had not so far been mounting challenges to voter eligibility at polling stations.</p> <p>But that, he said, was because the Republicans in Florida had adopted a different strategy, passing legislation that set stringent rules on voter registration. As a result, people were being disqualified if there were minor discrepancies, for example between the name on a driving licence and on a registration form.</p> <p>The Obama worker, who comes from outside the state, said: \"I have never seen such shameless manipulation of a process as I have seen here.\"</p> <p>Lichtman's equivalent on the Republican side is Ed Pozzuoli, another Fort Lauderdale-based lawyer. Pozzuoli, 46, who was also involved in the Broward recount, today described Litchman as an old friend, even though they are on different political sides.</p> <p>Pozzuoli, a partner at the Tripp Scott law firm who was lead Florida lawyer for Bush in the 2000 recount, would not say how many lawyers the Republicans will have in place on Tuesday. \"We will have enough,\" said.</p> <p>Also a volunteer, Pozzuoli expressed concern about the number of Democrat lawyers. \"Five thousand lawyers with nothing to do seems likely an ingredient for mischief,\" he said. \"I was there in 2000 and the more lawyers the Democrats had the more mischief there was.\"</p> <p>The Republicans wanted everyone who was entitled to vote to be allowed to do so, he said. That meant that the integrity of the process had to be protected.</p> <p>The legislation on registration did not apply to existing voters but only 300,000 new ones, and of those only a couple of thousand were at issue, including those with names like Mickey Mouse, Pozzuoli said. \"When you allow Mickey Mouse to vote, that diminishes everyone's right,\" he said.</p> <p>Florida's Republican governor, Charlie Crist, this week extended early voting hours by three hours a day, from 7am until 7pm.</p>",
  "<p>The high court today dismissed a bid by a man who was cleared of rape to bring a damages claim for malicious prosecution against his accuser.</p> <p>Anthony Hunt, 65, of Blandford St Mary, Dorset, was jailed for four years in December 2003 after being found guilty of the alleged July 1995 offence, but had his conviction overturned on appeal in December 2005.</p> <p>The conviction was quashed on the basis of inadequate direction to the jury and relevant fresh evidence.</p> <p>In January 2007, Mr Hunt, a former senior traffic warden, who maintains that the sex was consensual, launched a civil claim against the woman, who can only be identified as AB.</p> <p>He argued that by giving a witness statement to Hampshire constabulary in May 2002, and by agreeing to give evidence against him, she became the prosecutor although the charge was brought by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>But the action was stopped in its tracks before it could come to trial by a preliminary ruling by Mr Justice Blake that AB, a former special constable, was not the prosecutor.</p> <p>Her counsel, Anthony Metzer, said that there was a \"wealth of evidence\" showing her initial reluctance to disclose the incident, even less prosecute it.</p> <p>The chain of events leading to the prosecution was started by a friend whom AB had spoken to in confidence.</p> <p>He said that the case, believed to be the first attempt to sue a complainant in such circumstances, had huge potential significance - not just for AB but all those in her position.</p> <p>If Hunt was right, the result would be wholly against modern policy and principle that was to seek, wherever possible, to encourage women to come forward to make allegations of this nature - if true.</p> <p>\"The risks of civil litigation will just act as a further factor in inhibiting such a decision-making process\".</p> <p>Dismissing the claim, the judge said that the decision to charge Hunt was not based on an uncritical assumption of the truth of AB's allegation but a thorough investigation.</p> <p>In his judgment, AB never desired that Hunt be prosecuted, although she was a critical and central witness, whose evidence was considered reliable by the CPS.</p> <p>He concluded that, in all the circumstances of the case, there was nothing to indicate that the law required AB to be regarded as a prosecutor, either by initiating the prosecution or by taking it over.</p> <p>There was every reason to conclude that what she did was to attempt to assist the police in the investigation they started, pursued and wanted to continue to pursue, even after the court of appeal ruling.</p> <p>He added that he was conscious that Hunt had asserted his innocence, been acquitted and would undoubtedly be aggrieved about what had happened and the lack of compensation.</p> <p>But, it would be wholly unjust in the circumstances to leave AB vulnerable to a claim for very large damages.</p> <p>He refused Hunt permission to appeal, although he can renew his application to the court of appeal direct.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 17 2008. In the article above we referred to the 'Criminal Prosecution Service'. This should have been the Crown Prosecution Service. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>In May David Satterfield, under-secretary of state with responsibility for Iraq, boldly predicted that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Forces_Agreement\">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) with Iraq would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/30/normalisingoccupation\">agreed within weeks</a>. Three months later with the agreement still unsigned it appears the Americans are resorting to more traditional arm twisting to secure the deal that legalizes their presence in Iraq.</p> <p>The pressure can be described as a \"good cop, bad cop\" routine. The bad cop decision to conduct a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/syria-helicopter-attack\">special forces raid into Syria</a> appears to be rapidly backfiring. Indeed the decision by Washington to offer no public diplomacy has allowed the Syrians, perhaps the least media friendly of all Middle Eastern states, to control the agenda.</p> <p>This agenda has had limited success at unraveling exactly what happened. At present most news articles base their stories on statements by Syrian officials, Syrian victims (shown on Syrian government controlled television) and footage of Syrian crowds. Meanwhile in Washington the state department only confirmed that the Syrians called in a US official in Damascus and that \"she listened to them\", while the White House's Dana Perino said in Orwellian style that she \"would not comment on reports of this reported incident \u2026 you can come up here and try to beat it out of me but I will not be commenting on this in anyway, shape or form today\". Instead all we are left with is the comments from unnamed US officials that: \"We are taking matters into our own hands\". </p> <p>Al Jazeera provided the most in-depth coverage, managing to interview local residents of Sukkariyeh as well as obtaining <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/10/200810287154232562.html\">mobile phone footage</a> of the audacious daylight helicopter assault. Al Jazeera's major flaw was the inconsistency in their <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/10/2008102761547368843.html\">report</a> which stated that the attack occurred at 4.45pm yet included an interview with a fisherman who said it happened at 3.30pm. </p> <p>The bigger picture is that the relative success of the surge has led to increased confidence in military action amongst US commanders who believe that having gained the initiative they can afford to be more assertive. Indeed the US press linked the attack to the policy that President Bush assented to earlier this year. This secret directive, for which Congress made an outlay of $300m, promised backing for covert attacks by US forces from Lebanon to Afghanistan. </p> <p>The good cop routine has been to remind the Iraqi government how reliant they really are on US forces and how they shouldn't get too big for their boots. This was delivered by the US commander in Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/3274759/Iraqi-military-will-be-crippled-without-new-security-deal-warns-general.html\">General Raymond Odierno</a>, who warned that the \"Iraqi security forces would collapse\" if US forces withdrew to barracks . Ironically this came out just before the 13th of Iraq's 18 provinces, Wasit, was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7696785.stm\">handed over</a> to these same Iraqi security forces. </p> <p>The inherent weakness and division present within the Iraqi government was highlighted in its response to the raid. Initially Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh implicitly endorsed the operation, describing the area in which it occurred as \"a theatre of military operations where anti-Iraq terrorist activity takes place\". This was not a huge surprise considering al-Dabbagh's sustained criticism of Syria and Iraq (he once accused them of behaving like \"two naughty boys\"). Perhaps Dabbagh thought, as some American officials surely did, that Syria would not publically reveal that their state security could allow such a brazen incursion to occur. </p> <p>The Iraqi position quickly unravelled; Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary Labid Abbawi, described the incident as \"regrettable\" and said that \"we are sorry it happened\". A separate Foreign Ministry statement said that Iraq would provide Syria with the results of the Iraqi investigation into the incident, which demonstrated the \"extreme importance of joint security coordination and cooperation between the two countries\". Then <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-condemns-us-raid-on-syrian-village-976920.html\">Dabbagh made a 180\u00b0 turn</a> stating that \"the Iraqi government rejects US aircraft bombarding posts inside Syria government. The constitution does not allow Iraq to be used as a staging ground to attack neighbouring countries.\"</p> <p>The US is in the difficult situation of trying to secure its own position which clearly contradicts and interferes with an Iraqi constitution that it helped to create. Compromises over withdrawal in 2011 and the legal status of US soldiers have still resulted in inertia. The results of the present \"good cop, bad cop\" routine risks putting too much pressure on a weak Iraqi government and potentially undermining the real gains of recent months. </p>",
  "<p>The EU announced emergency talks today on the destabilising situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo after nine people were reported dead following overnight fighting and looting in a border town.</p> <p>EU officials will meet in Brussels before the weekend to discuss sending a humanitarian force to help peacekeepers in the country, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said.</p> <p>Oxfam was among the British agencies that announced it was pulling back its staff from Goma, which was besieged yesterday by a rebel army.</p> <p>UN radio said nine people were shot amid gunfire and looting in the town on the eastern border with Rwanda.</p> <p>Rebels loyal to the Tutsi warlord Laurent Nkunda closed in on Goma yesterday before declaring a ceasefire near its outskirts.</p> <p>\"Everybody's afraid of the wars. They are fearing what will happen next,\" a Goma resident, Tawite Anthony, told the BBC.</p> <p>A BBC reporter, Thomas Fessy, said he saw a body with bullet wounds after shooting and looting took place overnight.</p> <p>\"There will be a meeting of the 22 countries of the COPS [the EU's political and security committee] ... if not today then tomorrow,\" Kouchner told reporters in Paris.</p> <p>Oxfam said its international staff were being pulled out of Goma and national staff had been advised to stay at home but its programme had not been shut down.</p> <p>Juliette Prodhan, head of Oxfam in Congo said: \"We will continue to monitor the situation closely, in the hope of being able to resume humanitarian assistance.</p> <p>\"We are still committed to supplying clean water and sanitation to the over 65,000 people sheltering in Goma's camps.\"</p> <p>The UN peacekeeping force, Monuc, was preparing today to send reinforcements to the town, an important trading centre on the Congo-Rwanda border.</p> <p>The fighting has sent tens of thousands of civilians running for their lives in North Kivu province, where aid workers say two years of violence has forced nearly 1 million people from their homes, despite the end of Congo's broader 1998-2003 war.</p> <p>A Reuters reporter saw Congolese army (FARDC) soldiers patrolling the streets, arresting drunken comrades and looters.</p> <p>They detained one soldier whom they accused of killing the owner of a restaurant, whose body lay nearby.</p> <p>Colonel Jonas Padiri of FARDC said he and his men had entered Goma to stop the looting.</p> <p>Padiri said five people were killed overnight. UN-backed Radio Okapi said nine people were killed and three women raped.</p> <p>Many of Goma's Tutsi residents fled across the border to the Rwandan town of Gisenyi, fearing reprisals.</p> <p>\"All the Tutsis have crossed. People were not feeling safe,\" John Kanyoni, a Tutsi businessman and mineral dealer, said by phone from Gisenyi.</p> <p>Nkunda's men have already captured several key towns near Goma in North Kivu province and raised fears of a return to full-scale war in Congo.</p> <p>The national army has been routed and troops were reported to be fleeing Goma yesterday before the ceasefire. Tension between Congo and Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting Nkunda, also increased sharply, as they traded accusations yesterday over cross-border artillery attacks.</p> <p>The US said while Rwanda was not directly involved in the fighting, its territory was being used to support rebels.</p> <p>Congo's previous wars, between 1997 and 2003, which sucked in several neighbouring countries, caused the greatest loss of life anywhere since the Second World War, with more than 5 million dying mainly from hunger and illness.</p> <p>Since then the mineral-rich east region has remained restive, despite a peace agreement signed by all main rebel groups in January this year.</p> <p>Nkunda, who is though to have 5,000 fighters in his National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), claims to be protecting the minority Tutsi population in the east from Hutu militias linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.</p> <p>Despite signing the deal, he refuses to disarm, accusing government forces of breaking the ceasefire and collaborating with Hutu rebels.</p> <p>Nkunda said today he wanted to negotiate directly with the government over security and his objections to a $5bn (\u00a33bn) deal that gives China access to the region's mineral resources.</p> <p>He told Associated Press that he turned down a government offer of $2.5m to stop fighting because he could not abandon his mission to protect Congo's people.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch says it has documented summary executions, torture and rape committed by soldiers under Nkunda's command in 2002 and 2004.</p> <p>Struggles for Congo's mineral wealth have long been part of the country's wars.</p> <p>A UN investigation on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in Congo found that the conflict in the country had become mainly about \"access, control and trade\" of five key mineral resources: diamonds, copper, cobalt, gold and coltan \u2013 a metallic ore that provides materials for mobile phones and laptops.</p> <p>Exploitation of Congo's natural resources by foreign armies was \"systematic and systemic\", and the Ugandan and Rwandan leaders in particular had turned their soldiers into \"armies of business\". The UN panel estimated that Rwanda's army made at least $250m in 18 months by selling coltan.</p>",

  "<p>Russia's efforts to control oil and gas supplies to Europe from the Caspian basin and central Asia could advance significantly at the weekend when the Kremlin hosts a summit meeting of the leaders of long-time south Caucasus rivals Azerbaijan and Armenia.</p> <p>The talks, convened by President Dmitri Medvedev, are primarily aimed at settling the dispute over <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3658938.stm\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, one of the region's so-called frozen conflicts. In the early 1990s the two neighbours went to war over the enclave, which Azerbaijan regards as sovereign territory and which is currently controlled by ethnic Armenian forces.</p> <p>Russia's altruism should obviously be applauded. But Moscow's peacemakers are probably more concerned with increasing their political and economic influence in the crucial energy corridor connecting Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, with Georgia, Turkey and the west. This effort is seen by some regional experts as part of Russia's broader attempt to re-establish Soviet era spheres of influence beyond its borders.</p> <p>The Kremlin has been tirelessly wooing Azerbaijan's Moscow-educated president, Ilham Aliyev. Earlier this year Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, informed Azerbaijan as well as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan that it was ready to pay higher European market prices for their gas.</p> <p>The offer stripped away much of the economic rationale for the proposed US and EU-backed <a href=\"http://www.nabucco-pipeline.com/\">Nabucco</a> pipeline that, if built, would transport gas direct to Europe from the Caspian. It would also reduce producer countries' transit costs.</p> <p>\"Some experts in Baku believe the Gazprom gambit will be successful in achieving its main aim - to frustrate American and EU efforts to establish an alternative export network that would circumvent Russia,\" said industry writer <a href=\"http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav041008a.shtml\">Khadija Ismayilova</a> on Eurasianet.org.</p> <p>Russia's summer conflict with Georgia, though which key oil and gas pipelines to Turkey pass, and Europe's vacillating response have also left Azerbaijan reconsidering its westward-leaning stance. After the Soviet Union's collapse, Baku pursued links with the EU, encouraged investment by companies such as BP, and built ties to Nato.</p> <p>But resentment about recent western neglect, particularly by the US, coupled with concerns about its reassertive northern neighbour and the impasse over Nagorno-Karabakh, is enticing Azerbaijan towards a Russian-dominated \"Eurasian\" sphere, said regional experts Borut Grgic and Alexandros Petersen in the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122522752774177399.html\">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p>\"Azerbaijanis were disappointed by the west's reaction to events in Georgia and the growing inclination in many European capitals to capitulate to Russia in the broader Black Sea region,\" they said. \"Now Moscow, a long-time friend of Armenia in the Karabakh conflict, has begun quietly supporting Azerbaijan's position in the hopes of securing a deal for all of [its] available natural gas exports.</p> <p>\"In the absence of incentives or even attention from the west, Baku is seriously considering a major foreign policy reversal.\" And if the shift into Russia's camp came about, Grgic and Petersen warned, a \"strategic chunk\" of central Asia would likely follow suit.</p> <p>Russia is working hard to keep Armenia on board, too. Medvedev went to <a href=\"http://www.reporter.am/index.cfm?objectid=2E7D2047-3FF3-752C-2EFABEB2CC3D0E97\">Yerevan</a> earlier this month and signed a sheaf of cooperation agreements. After meeting President Serge Sarkisian, the Russian leader said talks on settling Nagorno-Karabakh were at \"an advanced stage\".</p> <p>Russia's diplomatic and economic offensive in the south Caucasus has not gone wholly unanswered. Turkey, with its own energy and security interests at stake, is in effect leading western mediation efforts over Nagorno-Karabakh - though getting little credit for it. President Abdullah Gul made a landmark visit to Armenia earlier this year in a bid to mend fences with an historic enemy. US envoys have also joined the fray.</p> <p>But western attempts to stay in the game are hampered by factors ranging from the absence of common EU policies on Caspian energy, the south Caucasus conflicts and Turkey to the US Congress's lopsided grandstanding on the Armenian genocide and the political transition in Washington. Criticism of Azerbaijan over human rights and this month's presidential election, won by Aliyev by a suspiciously large margin amid an opposition boycott, is also something Baku does not have to put up with from Moscow.</p> <p>Alarmed that the regional balance is shifting, the US vice-president and former oilman <a href=\"http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav090308.shtml\">Dick Cheney dashed to Baku</a> in September after visiting Georgia. He did not stay long and it is unclear what, if anything, he achieved. No sooner had Aliyev bidden Cheney goodbye than he flew to Moscow for consultations. It was a good indicator of where the power lies.</p> <p>Cheney's sudden appearance prompted wry questions in Baku about why it took him eight years to make the trip. It also left some observers suggesting the Bush administration has already \"lost the Caspian\" - and only just realised.</p>",

Net earnings leapt 28.5% to \u20ac3.7bn.</p> <p>But the world's third-largest auto manufacturer behind Toyota and General Motors indicated that earnings had been squeezed in the third quarter, the current quarter was proving difficult and 2009 would be \"very tough\".</p> <p>The group is at the centre of a storm over volatile trading in its shares after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/vw-volkswagen-short-selling\">Porsche, which wants to take it over, said it had amassed a controlling stake of 74.1%</a> and aimed for a \"domination agreement\" or 75% holding next year.</p> <p>Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, VW's chief financial officer, threw a spanner in Porsche's works, however, by suggesting that its plans could be derailed by a prolonged court battle.</p> <p>The European commission is poised to take Germany back to the European Court of Justice over its refusal to remove a 20% blocking minority vote enjoyed by the federal state of Lower Saxony under the 1960 \"VW Law\". </p> <p>The ECJ banned this law just over a year ago but Berlin's revised version retains this effective veto on key decisions for the state.</p> <p>P\u00f6tsch refused to comment on VW's stance, saying this was an issue for its supervisory board, but said VW itself had played no role in the recent frenzied trading, selling none of its \"put\" options.</p> <p>Today's figures sent VW's stock up 13% in late-afternoon trading to \u20ac585, compared with a all-time high of \u20ac1,005 on Tuesday and a close of \u20ac517 yesterday.</p> <p>VW is now valued at around \u20ac174bn, more than all its European peers combined, which have begun <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive\">announcing temporary shutdowns of plants and lay-offs to cope with depressed sales and earnings</a>. P\u00f6tsch said VW could prolong Christmas/New year holidays by a few days to cope with slackening demand.</p> <p>He said turnover rose by 5.5% in the period to \u20ac85.4bn, with deliveries up 4% to 4.8m worldwide \u2013 raising VW's global market share to 10.1% from 9.6%. The group hopes to further increase its share in a worldwide market which is set to decline in 2009.</p> <p>P\u00f6tsch said: \"We are confirming our forecast for 2008 despite the dramatic deterioration in global economic conditions and the automotive industry environment in recent months.\" He added: \"We are confident we will be able to beat the total market performance as we have done this year.\"</p> <p>German truck- and bus-maker MAN, meanwhile, reported operating earnings up a third at \u20ac422m.</p>",
  "<p>At church on Sundays, Juliana Tocay fibs and introduces 3-year-old Katerin as her daughter. The truth is too complicated to explain.</p> <p>Tocay is Katerin's foster mother, making her family part of a much-watched test of whether Guatemala can take care of its own needy children.</p> <p>After essentially closing off the pipeline that sent nearly 5,000 children for adoptions in the US last year, Guatemala has launched an ambitious campaign to recruit foster parents and even adoptive parents at home.</p> <p>Only a few dozen families are participating and, as Tocay's experience illustrates, it will be a tall order to change the culture of a country that typically views only biological children as true members of the family.</p> <p>From the United Nations to potential adoptive parents in the US, Guatemala's experiment is getting scrutiny because many of the children who can't find temporary or permanent families will end up in deficient institutions.</p> <p>\"Our friends might not understand, but God gave us something so we could give her something,\" said Tocay, who lives in a tidy subdivision outside Guatemala City with her husband and three children. \"And He gives us strength to be strong for her.\"</p> <p>For years, children like Katerin, who was abandoned by her mother in Guatemala's rural highlands, would have found their new homes in America. Last year, Guatemala sent more children to the US than any other nation except China.</p> <p>But nearly everyone agreed that the system was vulnerable to abuse, especially by shadowy middlemen who sometimes paid birth mothers to give up their children.</p> <p>Amid global pressure, Guatemala passed a law in December that made adoptions part of a government system, taking it out of the hands of lawyers and other private actors.</p> <p>But as it works to create its new system, Guatemala's new national adoption council said in September that it will not accept any new cases. Likewise, the US state department has stopped processing new adoptions from that country.</p> <p>US groups that advocate for international adoption have criticised the new law, saying it is creating barriers that keep children away from loving parents. And they have expressed doubts that Guatemala has the resources to properly care for those children.</p> <p>Nearly 60% of Guatemalans live in poverty, meaning many families cannot afford another child, although foster parents do receive a stipend. And authorities are bypassing the richest families because children would find it tough to leave luxury to return to their biological families.</p> <p>Only about 45 families in a nation of 13 million currently have taken in foster children since the program began this year.</p> <p>\"Guatemalans have good intentions, but maybe they don't know how to channel that assistance,\" said Vilma Masaya, who had oversight of the program as deputy secretary for the department of social welfare. \"For us, it is about changing the culture.\"</p> <p>Masaya said the recruiting effort is critical because countless children might be shifted from the adoption track into government care if an ongoing investigation detects irregularities in how they were placed for adoption.</p> <p>Authorities have felt compelled to loosen the requirements for foster parents by allowing single mothers to participate and by raising the maximum age from 55 to 65.</p> <p>There are signs of progress. By creating satellite offices in far-flung regions, the department of social welfare has already doubled its pool of interested families.</p> <p>Advocates also are finding success by taking their recruiting pitch directly to the pulpit of evangelical churches that have spread throughout Guatemala. About 90% of their families have been recruited from church events, authorities said.</p> <p>One of those foster mothers, Claudia Lopez, frequently references her spirituality when discussing why she and her husband, Marco, took in a baby girl named Sandra.</p> <p>Their own daughter died in an auto accident. And when Marco, a fireman, came across a mother who had killed her daughter while committing suicide, they took it as a sign from God that they needed to open their home</p> <p>Now their Guatemala City home is filled with the giggles of a girl who recently celebrated her first birthday with clowns and pi\u00f1atas.</p> <p>But Lopez does not hide her sadness in knowing that Sandra will someday return to her biological family. The government sends social workers for routine visits that help ease the introductions, and eventual farewells, between foster parents and children.</p> <p>\"We love her as if she were our own. She is so sweet, she makes you love her,\" Lopez said. \"At night, I think about saying goodbye. But then I think that somewhere, maybe her mother is crying, too, and that they should be together.\"</p>",
  "<p>In this week's show we examine whether the bipartisan approach to the financial crisis has broken down after David Cameron accused Gordon Brown of embarking on a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/30/gordon-brown\">spending splurge</a> in response to the recession.</p> <p>We also discuss the US presidential election, and ask whether Barack Obama is on the verge of a historic victory \u2013 and what that will mean for Europe.<br>Finally we turn our attention to the BBC, after the row over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/30/bbc-jonathan-ross-russell-brand1\">Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross's childish prank on Radio 2</a>.</p> <p>Joining me around the table is <strong>Jenni Russell</strong>, the Guardian columnist.

And in the 70s it seemed all major bands were contractually obliged to knock out a lumbering great double album every three years or so as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pinkfloyd\">Pink Floyd</a>, ELO, Chicago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/who\">the Who</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/ledzeppelin\">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/therollingstones\">the Rolling Stones</a>, Genesis and Yes knocked out multiple discs. Back then, if you couldn't string together 30-odd tracks telling the psychedelic story of, say, a lamb feeling slightly knackered on Broadway, you were nobody.<br> Most decent bands, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/redhotchilipeppers\">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, have marked their creative high point with a monolithic double-disc masterpiece and many a generation has been defined by them. In my youth in the late 70s most HMVs were a battleground as <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/electriclightorchestra/albums/album/148747/review/5940917/out_of_the_blue\">Out of the Blue</a> waged bloody war with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/sep/10/popandrock.shopping\">London's Calling</a> for control over popular culture. But as the major labels tighten their belts, dropping new bands and scything away at their payrolls with furious abandon, is the double album the latest industry dinosaur to face the chop?<br> I mean, you'd expect the Cure - a band with past double opus form, thanks to 1987's <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/229857/review/5943080?utm_source=Rhapsody&amp;utm_medium=CDreview\">Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</a> - to be able to release a double album, right? Er, sadly not. Their new album 4:13 Dream is the \"light\" first half of a double collection, with the second \"dark\" half to be released separately in 2009. </p> <p>Robert Smith recently told me the rather shocking factors behind the release strategy. Basically, Geffen were only prepared to pay them royalties equivalent to a single album, even if the album was priced as a double. In effect the label were penalising the band for wanting to give their fans more music for less. Smith insisted he didn't care about making any more money but the principle was paramount; he was furious at the idea of a major label conning him out of making the record he wanted. So he held back the second half of the album for six months and one day later, the earliest moment that his contract permitted. The concept would be intact, it would just be up to the fan to Sellotape the two \"episodes\" together.</p> <p>Is this the (disappointingly thin) shape of things to come? The noughties have seen a notable decline in the standard of doubles \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2003/sep/28/features.review37\">Speakerboxx/The Love Below</a> was fatally lop-sided, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/sep/17/popandrock.shopping2\">American Idiot</a> brutally crass and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/may/05/popandrock.shopping2\">Stadium Arcadium</a>, well, a Red Hot Chili Peppers record. Instead the likes of Muse, prime candidates for gatefold glory, are promising to release batches of songs on the internet rather than crowbar them onto a single CD. Will our burgeoning young artists now be robbed of the chance to make their White Album? <br> There is hope for this endangered rock species. This week Patrick Wolf announced that his next album would be a double \u2013 one \"light\" half and one \"punky, aggressive\" half \u2013 featuring Alec Empire from Atari Teenage Riot. Wolf claims it will be a politically charged record tackling his depression, near insanity and redemption in the arms of fresh love. Fingers crossed for this generation's The Wall?</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/30/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc\">firestorm</a> ignited by the BBC's failure to act promptly against Russell Brand, Jonathan Ross and the editorial team responsible for their puerile bullying of Andrew Sachs is synthetic. Had the Mail on Sunday's Miles Goslett not spotted the offending broadcast's potential to enliven news pages the incident would have passed with Britain unaware of Georgina Baillie and the <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=311606472\">Satanic Sluts Extreme</a>. But Goslett did his job. The problem is that Mark Thompson and Lesley Douglas <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/radio2/lesleydouglas.shtml\">did not</a>. That is why furore followed, with MPs, newspapers and eventually licence payers demanding defenestration of the performers. <br> They are the wrong target. Holding Brand and Ross to account for being facile, arrogant and foulmouthed is silly. That is what they are for. The real scandal is that the producer and his line manager cleared the show for broadcast. Pre-recording exists to permit the correction of mistakes. To insist that the people who authorised this should have their careers examined is hardly judgmental. </p> <p>Until the BBC holds to account instantly staff who make such mistakes, its belt and braces <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/edguide/\">approach to editorial decision-making</a> will remain peculiarly vulnerable to humiliating failure. Excessive bureaucracy has created a corporation in which neither belt nor braces know which is holding the trousers up. The result is that nobody feels obliged to take the job seriously. </p> <p>This is the first lesson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/running/executive/eb_mark_thompson.shtml\">Mark Thompson</a> should take from his latest public relations disaster. When the buck stops with producers and editors, not in ill-defined committee structures above their heads, mistakes are less common. The BBC has persistently refused to adopt direct personal responsibility. It is increasingly hard to escape the suspicion that it privileges empire building over reputation.</p> <p>The second lesson is bigger. It is that commercial rivals \u2013 who have long accused Radio 2 of a blatant and inexcusable <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/is-cool-radio-2-now-too-hot-for-its-own-good-427767.html\">raid</a> on territory they could control if the publicly-financed behemoth were not parked on their lawns \u2013 have more than a soupcon of a point. A lot of the bilge pumped into the public domain by empty-headed celebrities with stuffed wallets does not begin to meet any definition of public service except the BBC's own: that is, anything that attracts wider audiences and thus justifies the licence fee (according to which logic, the corporation might justify broadcasting public executions.)</p> <p>There is very little that risky or innovative about performers such as Brand and Ross. If the BBC still has the courage to take risks it should do so on issues of significance - through journalism, not comedy. With the news industry in crisis, the BBC has a superb opportunity to advance the cause of investigative reporting and the classic fourth estate ideal of holding power to account. The sadness of Mark Thompson's term as DG to date is that it has attempted too little of this. His post-<a href=\"http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/\">Hutton</a> BBC seems terrified of serious, significant risk. That is among the reasons that it employs fools to boast about who they have slept with in preference to tough, \"edgy\" journalists. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewgilligan\">Andrew Gilligan</a> does not insult harmless grandfathers. His targets deserve the attention he gives them.</p>",
  "<p>So what exactly does change look like? Barack Obama has ambitious energy and environmental plans. If he wins on November 4, who will he recruit to carry them out? Will he rely more heavily on Washington newcomers or on Clinton administration veterans who know their way around the White House? (See who John McCain might choose to green his White House <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/environment/2008/oct/29/network-mccain-cabinet\">here</a>)</p> <p>Obama's choice for a transition team leader \u2014 John Podesta, former Clinton chief of staff \u2014 suggests he's willing to look back to the Clinton years for top staff. But Obama has also surrounded himself with bright and accomplished advisers (note our interviews with energy policy chief Jason Grumet and director Heather Zichal) who are newer to the national scene. Will he fill Cabinet-level environmental jobs with fresh faces or stick to a more traditional path with ex-governors and Washington lawmakers? We asked campaign advisors, nonprofit conservation advocates, think-tank types, lobbyists, academics, and friendly looking folks behind us in line at the co-op. It's a cardinal sin in Washington to openly speculate on these matters before an election, so we promised confidentiality to many sources.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p>Managing the nation's energy policy and nuclear safety is one of the most glamourless, thankless Cabinet-level positions, according to former Department of Energy officials. The secretary oversees the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and nuclear waste disposal and a lot of private contracts. \"You get a whole lot of responsibility for regulating, but you don't get a lot of credit for achieving good things in the political process,\" said Walter Rosenbaum, a former DOE consultant and energy policy scholar. Still, the position could take on more prominence in the next administration, given the amount of attention the candidates devoted to energy during the campaign.</p> <p><strong>Jason Grumet</strong><br>The Obama campaign's lead energy and environment advisor first started working with the senator when he arrived in Washington in 2005. In helping Obama develop his energy platform, Jason Grumet drew from his experience as head of the National Commission on Energy Policy and the Bipartisan Policy Center. Grumet's think-tank work has focused on building consensus among diverse interests, though the NCEP's 2004 energy report annoyed many environmentalists by calling for pollution permits to be given free of charge to polluters and by supporting a \"safety valve\" that would limit the price of pollution credits. This job has traditionally gone to seasoned governors and lawmakers, but Obama has shown affinity for policy wonks like Grumet. (Read a Grist interview with Grumet.)</p> <p><strong>Ed Rendell</strong><br>With energy issues in the national spotlight, a veteran politician with deal-brokering experience could be at a premium. The Pennsylvania governor has worked to curb mercury emissions from the state's coal-fired power plants, adopted California's tough clean-car regulations, and pushed tax credits and other measures to attract renewable energy companies. Ed Rendell was one of Hillary Clinton's key supporters during the Democratic primary, but has since campaigned for Obama. If he delivers his swing state next month, this spot (or another in Obama's Cabinet) could be his for the taking.</p> <p><strong>Dan Reicher</strong><br>Dan Reicher [PDF] has recently talked up geothermal energy as the potential \"killer app\" of the energy world. He gets his techie metaphors at Google.org, the philanthropic arm of the search engine giant, where he is director of climate change and energy initiatives. Before that he worked as an assistant energy secretary under President Clinton, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a sales executive at a renewable energy firm. Reicher's knowledge of venture capital and commercializing green technology make him an appealing candidate to Bill Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project. \"We're facing one of the most promising worldwide market opportunities that we've ever had, and we need this kind savvy business experience,\" Becker said. (Watch a Grist interview with Reicher.)</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency administrator</h2> <p>This position is traditionally given Cabinet rank, meaning the EPA administrator gets to sit at a long oval table in the West Wing. The EPA enforces (or is supposed to enforce) the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the rest of the nation's environmental laws. The next EPA administrator could also be charged with implementing a new cap-and-trade carbon emissions program, which both candidates call for (in different versions). \"That would be one of the most complicated acts ever to pass Congress,\" said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan environmental policy and climate change scholar. \"It would call for a level of cooperation across government agencies like [the formation of] Homeland Security. And we know how difficult that has been.\"</p> <p><strong>Mary Nichols</strong><br>As one of the key leaders working to implement California's groundbreaking and ambitious 2006 climate law, Mary Nichols has eye-catching qualifications for this job. She's been chair of the California Air Resources Board since July 2007, reprising a role she held from 1978 to 1983 under Gov. Jerry Brown. In the early 1970s, she worked as an environmental lawyer, spending time at the Natural Resources Defense Council, then later going on to serve as secretary for California's Resources Agency and a senior official in the Clinton EPA. Her extraordinarily deep resume would be hard to match if government experience factors heavily in Obama's decision.</p> <p><strong>Kathleen McGinty</strong><br>Pennsylvania's top environmental official worked alongside Gov. Rendell in attracting green businesses and regulating coal and manufacturers -- no small task in the rust-belt state. As head of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, Kathleen McGinty battled with Republicans and coal industry officials and succeeded in establishing tough clean-air standards. She was a long-time Al Gore aide who first worked on his Senate staff in 1988. She chaired President Clinton's Council on Environmental Quality, the first (and only) woman to hold that position. She isn't part of Obama's inner circle of advisors, but choosing her could signal to environmentalists that he takes their concerns seriously. (Read a Grist interview with McGinty.)</p> <p><strong>Dan Esty</strong><br>A top energy advisor for the Obama campaign, Dan Esty would bring both EPA experience and academic policy chops. He served in George H.W. Bush's EPA, helping to craft the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act and the environmental provisions of NAFTA. He's now an environmental law professor at Yale, where he's written recently on sustainable business. In April he helped bring a group of governors to Yale to plot ways to fight climate change. \"With his closeness to the Obama campaign and his record with the EPA, I think he would be one of the top contenders,\" said University of Florida political scientist Walter Rosenbaum. \"He has a reputation as a moderate. But if you want someone who could rally the environmental troops, he could do that.\"</p> <h2>Secretary of agriculture</h2> <p>The secretary of agriculture oversees food and farm policy, and is charged with everything from securing food safety to promoting agricultural trade to fighting hunger. The USDA inspects and grades meats and grains, administers crop and ethanol subsidies, hands out food stamps and disaster relief, runs land conservation programs, and oversees organic labeling. The U.S. Forest Service, with its 190 million acres of forest and grassland, is also under the department's purview. Sustainable-food guru Michael Pollan recently argued that our fossil fuel-dependent food system can't go much longer without a locavorous overhaul. An innovative thinker in this position would help.</p> <p><strong>Tom Vilsack</strong><br>The former Iowa governor and presidential candidate fits the classic mold for secretary of agriculture: a popular leader from a farm state (though he grew up in Pittsburgh). Vilsack supported Hillary Clinton in the Iowa primary, and if she had won the nomination, he'd be ordering Secretary of Ag business cards right now. His decidedly moderate record on farm policy may not appeal to Obama, but, like the Democratic candidate, Vilsack strongly supports corn ethanol, at least as a bridge to cellulosic ethanol. He instituted some new regulations on Iowa's industrial hog farms, though watchdogs say he should've done much more. And he understands that sustainable rural development means more than just commodity farming. His recent op-ed in the Argus Leader (S.D.), hometown paper to Obama confidante Tom Daschle, could be interpreted as a letter of interest for the job. (Read a Grist interview with Vilsack.)</p> <p><strong>Tom Buis</strong><br>Tom Buis is president of the National Farmer's Union, the more progressive, small-farm-friendly of the two largest farm advocacy groups (the other is the Farm Bureau). He was senior agricultural policy advisor to Daschle, the Obama buddy and former Senate majority leader. And he was a Hoosier grain and livestock farmer with his brothers Mike and Jeff, who still run the family farm. Buis disappointed conservationists, hunger-relief advocates, and fruit-and-vegetable growers by endorsing last year's \"sham reform\" farm bill. Buis would be a don't-rock-the-boat (or the tractor?) choice on crop subsidies and food policy. Michael Pollan would not be happy. </p> <p><strong>Stephanie Herseth Sandlin</strong><br>South Dakota's sole representative in the U.S. House has made a name for herself as a prairie populist along the lines of Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D). Stephanie Herseth Sandlin directed the South Dakota Farmers Union Foundation before getting elected to the House, where she's a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats. She sits on the House Agriculture Committee, a position that's allowed her send bountiful shares of federal crop subsidies back to her home state. If Obama wants substantial farm-policy reform, the House Ag Committee might be the last place to look. If he wants a charismatic leader who's pledged to put rural concerns before left-right ideology, Herseth Sandlin could be a possibility.</p> <h2>Secretary of the interior</h2> <p>The Department of the Interior manages 500 million acres, about 20 percent of all U.S. land, and also wields significant control over energy reserves, dealing with coal and mineral deposits on public land, offshore oil, and many hydroelectric dams. National parks, national wildlife refuges, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs also fall under the department's umbrella. Fifteen of the last 16 interior secretaries have come from Western states, where most public land lies. Break that tradition at your own peril, Mr. President-elect.</p> <p><strong>Brian Schweitzer</strong><br>The bolo-tied governor of Montana is mentioned as a Rising Star of the Democratic Party often enough to have it engraved on his belt buckle. He advocates a use-'em-all approach to energy sources, including \"clean coal,\" liquefied coal, and Montana oil as well as renewable sources. A rancher who chose a Republican as a running mate for lieutenant governor, Brian Schweitzer has a knack for talking about natural resources and land-use issues in down-to-earth language. \"He can speak to the West,\" said Bill Becker. \"He's shown a talent for bridging the gap between the new West and the old West. What that means in energy terms is bridging the gap between fossil energy and renewable energy.\"</p> <p><strong>Jamie Rappaport Clark</strong><br>Bill Clinton's former Fish and Wildlife Service director managed Endangered Species Act protections and oversaw a massive expansion of the National Wildlife Refuge System. After 20 years in government, Jamie Rappaport Clark landed at Defenders of Wildlife, where she, well, defends wildlife. She has testified in Congress against Bush's Interior Department, calling it to task for manipulating science to undermine the ESA. \"There are few [people] if anybody who knows more about these issues than Jamie does,\" said Leda Clark, executive director of Endangered Species Coalition. \"She has a very practical sense of the problems and potential fixes in the department.\" One issue: She was a military child who grew up in part in California and Okinawa, along with North Carolina and Georgia. It's tough to argue that makes her a Westerner, though a Changer-in-Chief might be willing to buck that tradition. (Read a Grist Q&amp;A with Rappaport Clark.)</p> <p><strong>Jay Inslee</strong><br>The suburban Seattle congressman has earned the favor of conservationists through his leadership in protecting open spaces and wildlife. He sought to preserve roadless areas against Bush administration encroachment and has been one of the House's steadiest voices opposing logging on public lands. Jay Inslee has a lower political profile than Schweitzer and the other Western governors who could be offered this job. He wouldn't be a popular choice with Republicans, so Obama would have to think carefully about burning the political capital required to get Inslee's nomination confirmed. But his work on renewable energy, including his book Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, jives with Obama's focus. </p> <h2>Bonus position: climate change czar</h2> <p>By creating a prominent new position and staff, \u00e0 la Homeland Security, the next president could send a clear message that he plans to take global warming seriously. Whether such a move would be smart governing is another matter. Creating new job titles and shuffling around departments willy-nilly is no guarantee of getting anything accomplished, of course. Rather than presiding over a significant restructuring of departments, a \"climate change czar\" could function more as a special environmental adviser to the president. Then again, the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality is already charged with that job. (Look for a trusted advisor and policy wonk like Chicagoan Howard Learner to fill that role for Obama.) Still, after a year of squabbling over flag pins, both candidates ought to know that symbolism matters, and the symbolic weight of a new position might be worth the effort.</p> <p><strong>Bill Richardson</strong><br>Saving the planet might be the next logical challenge for a guy who's already been a U.S. representative, ambassador to the U.N., energy secretary, governor of New Mexico, and international peace negotiator in North Korea and Darfur. As governor, Bill Richardson signed an aggressive energy package that, among other things, required all investor-owned electrical utilities to generate 10 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2011. As a presidential candidate, he unveiled an ambitious energy plan that included a carbon cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 90 percent by 2050 and a pledge to cut U.S. oil demand by 50 percent by 2020. He promised to be the first true \"energy president\" before dropping out of the Democratic primary and endorsing Obama. If he's ready to leave the governor's mansion in Santa Fe, this position could be an appealing fit. </p> <p><strong>Terry Tamminen</strong><br>As a top advisor to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), Terry Tamminen helped engineer California's ambitious 2006 carbon cap-and-trade plan. He then left the state in a quest to become a \"Johnny Appleseed\" of climate action, spreading plans and ideas for cutting greenhouse gases to leaders across the country, including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R). He gained administrative experience during a stint as head of the California EPA from 2003 to 2004, and he wrote the 2006 book Lives Per Gallon: The True Cost of Our Oil Addiction. As a Democrat who worked under a Republican governor, Tamminen would be a good fit for Obama's post-partisan philosophy. (Read a Grist interview with Tamminen, and still more about Tamminen.)</p> <p><strong>Al Gore</strong><br>As a former vice president and creator of the highly influential film An Inconv -- OK, you already know all about the guy. If Obama wants to name a climate czar, Al Gore would certainly be at the top of the short list; Obama has said as much. Gore would bring knowledge, expertise, and unparalleled star power (unless Bono took the job ...), and he could clank his Nobel Peace Prize on the table for added gravitas at cabinet meetings. But would Gore want another government job? Last year he said no. He's been much more effective (and happy) talking about the climate crisis as a private citizen than as a government official, so it would likely take an unprecedented Obama charm offensive to get Gore into any formal position. But Obama can be a charming guy ...</p> <p>\u2022 This article was shared by <a href=\"http://grist.org/\">Grist</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a></p>",

  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>What's so special about North Ronaldsay mutton?</strong></p> <p>Where do we start? These rare Orkney sheep live wild on the rocky shore of the north Atlantic, munching on seaweed. They have evolved to exist almost entirely on this diet, because a dry-stone wall has confined them to the shoreline since 1832. They venture out to graze at low tide, and ruminate at high tide.</p> <p>The breed is ancient - about 5,000 years old - and still exists in its pure form on North Ronaldsay, where it outnumbers the human inhabitants of the island by about 50 to one. Each October, around 300 mature sheep are caught when the tide is out and the moon is up. Many of the carcasses are spirited away to London restaurants.</p> <p>Enough about the sheep - what about the meat? The mutton is lean and rich in iodine (thanks to the seaweed diet), and is said to taste rich and gamey. We can't confirm this, as the 'mutton run' is still in progress, and the meat won't reach us until tomorrow. But as a unique local product, it should surely be celebrated. </p> <p>The following restaurants will have North Ronaldsay mutton on the menu this winter: Caf\u00e9 Spice Namaste, Anthony Worrall Thompson's restaurants, the Square, the Earl Spencer, the Royal Automobile Club and Roast. Catch it while you can.</p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Pumpkins</strong></p> <p>Pumpkins are impossible to avoid this week, but that's no bad thing. Use their flesh to make soups, stews and risottos, served in their hollowed-out shells; toast their seeds for snacking; or take a miniature specimen to work. </p> <p>There is something comical about a pumpkin - the sight of it will cheer you up until lunchtime, when you can cut it in half, stick it in the microwave for a few minutes, then mash up the flesh with some butter. It sounds weird but it works, according to <a href=\"http://www.whattoeatnow.com/\">TV chef Valentine Warner</a>.</p> <p>If that doesn't float your boat, try Allegra McEvedy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/07/foodanddrink.chicken\">chicken, pumpkin and borlotti beans</a> or her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/29/foodanddrink.allegramcevedy\">ways with pumpkin innards</a>; Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/03/recipes.features\">tart, salad and risotto</a>; or Nigel Slater's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/16/foodanddrink.recipes\">tortilla</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/22/foodanddrink.recipes1\">steamed pumpkin with red curry sauce</a>.</p> <h2>THE QUOTE</h2> <p>\"Customers eating the burger must be at least 18 or accompanied by their parent or guardian and without anxiety, asthma, heart or bowel problems.\"<br><em>An advertisement for 'the world's hottest burger', now being served at the <a href=\"http://www.grandunioncamden.co.uk/content/homepage.html\">Grand Union bar and grill chain</a></em></p> <h2>BEST BUY</h2> <p><strong>Le Creuset</strong> have introduced a gorgeous new <a href=\"http://www.lecreuset.co.uk/Whats-New/Patisserie/\">patisserie range</a>.

Add enough club soda just to soak the sugar. Crush with the back of the bar spoon. Add half a measure of rye whiskey and the absinthe and stir till smooth. Add ice. Stir and add remaining rye whiskey while lifting the ice and stirring. Keep stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Add a twist of lemon.</p> <p><strong>Salvatore's tips: </strong>Mixing the sazerac is a labour of love and should not be rushed. The ingredients should be mixed in slowly. I serve sazerac in my bar in a special 1950s wine glass, but a chilled cocktail glass also works perfectly.</p> <h2>OFFER OF THE WEEK</h2> <p>The <strong>Seafood Restaurants</strong> in St Andrews and St Monans are offering a special winter deal from now until March 31.

  "<p>This has been an odd <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">campaign</a> at times: great expectations about this being the final battle for Gordon Brown's career came crashing down with the stock markets.</p> <p>As share prices fell, Brown's personal valuation rose, while in inverse proportion, the heat and edge in the campaign has dissipated.</p> <p>This has left the parties and pundits picking for bones during an often-muted campaign, but one issue has regularly surfaced: the capacities of the leading candidates. </p> <p>Despite the often artful campaign management by Labour and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a>, Lindsay Roy, the non-politician chosen by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>, and Peter Grant, the Fife council leader running for the nationalists, have both been tested. </p> <p>Both have had slips, some potentially serious. Neither seems entirely at ease with the intense pressure of such a pivotal campaign.</p> <p>With byelection day just a week away, the four leading candidates will stage their last television debate on STV tonight. A consensus is emerging: Roy is inexperienced, ill-prepared but committed and keen; Grant is clearly experienced, and obviously able, but appears reluctant to leave Fife for London. </p> <p>The first STV head-to-head between Roy and Grant five weeks ago was a \"car crash\" for Roy, said one experienced observer. Labour insiders acknowledge he was ill-prepared. Roy, agreed to be a gifted headmaster who now runs Gordon Brown's old high school in Kirkcaldy, stumbled through his first answers. </p> <p>The interviews were prerecorded. His alarmed minder cried foul, claimed Roy's earpiece wasn't working and demanded a second take. Still Roy went off script and rambled. The SNP were delighted when Roy said Brown's failure to call an election last year was a \"mistake\" \u2013 their first major point in the \"gaffe game\" both sides play.</p> <p>Another gaffe-ometer point for the nationalists came when they uncovered a letter Roy had sent to an SNP councillor, subtly complaining about Labour education spending cuts in his old school's budget of nearly \u00a3140,000, before Labour lost control of Fife to the current SNP-Lib Dem coalition.<br> He's more practised now, less fazed by media questioning, and Labour has sent every household in Glenrothes a glossy mini-magazine with photos of Roy's RAF pilot father and mother, a second world war nurse, and his wedding photo \u2013 a wee Mills and Boon scrapbook for every home. Grant too has fumbled, and is now nicknamed \"Homesick\" by Labour. Earlier this week, he told the Telegraph's Scottish politics reporter that he only wanted to go to Westminster for five years, adding: \"I don't want to have to spend any more time down there than I have to. I would be homesick after more than that.\"</p> <p>He has been unsettled by challenges over steep rises imposed by his council in home help charges for the elderly - up from \u00a34 a week to \u00a311 an hour for some, and a new \u00a351 charge for emergency alarms \u2013 and over the impact of the SNP's plans to replace council tax with a local income tax.<br> While the SNP insists that Grant's SNP-Lib Dem coalition has hired more teachers, extended free home care for more pensioners and frozen council tax, Grant has been harassed at public meetings by disability rights campaigners over homecare charges.</p> <p>And as this blog reported earlier, Grant's coalition with the Lib Dems has been put under immense strain by SNP campaigning claims about local policy, particularly an apparent guarantee of council tax cuts to 2011 and free school meals for all under-eights \u2013 promises being challenged by his Lib Dem partners.</p> <p>It is difficult to escape the impression sometimes that Grant, a mild-mannered, gentle man, would much rather be somewhere else. </p> <p>As for Roy, tonight's studio debate will be another very public test of his nerve and his new career as politician \u2013 each candidate gets to question the others. This is where the headteacher faces his employer. Who will eventually feel like a school kid again?</p>",
  "<p>1) <strong>Mexican grand prix, 1964</strong></p> <p>To this day, John Surtees remains the only man to have won championships on both two and four wheels, and this was the race that he secured his formula one drivers' crown. But he did it by a whisker \u2014 after 10 races, the championship was decided in the very last lap of the season. Three men went into the Mexico City finale with a chance to win the title: the favourite was points leader Graham Hill (BRM), ahead of Surtees (Ferrari) and outsider Jim Clark (Lotus), all seen in this <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fvvGaa4J0\">rare footage from the race</a>.</p> <p>Hill's hopes ended in retirement after a collision with Ferrari's Lorenzo Bandini, leaving Clark in the lead and on course for a miraculous win. It wasn't to be, however, as his Lotus started leaking oil and the engine seized on the last lap, with Clark eventually limping home in fifth position. Surtees, running in third place, was helped to the title by his team-mate Bandini, who let him through into second place, giving Surtees a one-point advantage over Hill in the final points standings.</p> <p>2) <strong>Japanese grand prix, 1976</strong></p> <p>From the season when some grand prix cars boasted six wheels came one of the most enthralling battles ever or, as one commentator put it, \"the racing grudge match of the decade\". It was the somewhat familiar scenario of Ferrari against McLaren, with Niki 'the rat' Lauda pitted against James 'sex \u2014 the breakfast of champions' Hunt. Earlier in the year, Lauda had the edge over England's great playboy with a 23-point lead going into the German grand prix at the Nurburgring \u2014 but then suffered the horrific accident that left him close to death. In perhaps the greatest sporting comeback ever, he sat out just two races, returning to keep the points tally of Hunt \u2014 who was on a winning streak \u2014 in check.</p> <p>It came down to the last round in Japan, with Lauda's advantage over Hunt just three points. On race day, the fog and rain rolled down from Mount Fuji to cloak the circuit and delay the start of the finale by an hour and a half. The grand prix went ahead, with Lauda starting from third behind Hunt, but Lauda almost immediately pulled into the pits \u2014 knowing full well that doing so was likely to hand Hunt the title \u2014 as the conditions were so dire. The remainder of the race was no breeze for Hunt, however, as he suffered a puncture and crossed the line in third place and, as you can tell from <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=EBkNqJVe28k\">this fantastic clip</a>, unconvinced he had won the title. He had \u2014 by a single point.</p> <p>3) <strong>Australian grand prix, 1986</strong></p> <p>You can read the colourful report of the moment that millions of British fans cried into their cornflakes in this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/29/formula-one-motor-sport-mansell-1986\" title=\"\">From the Vault</a>, but, to summarise, Nigel Mansell needed to finish third in the season closer at Adelaide to win what would have been his first formula one title. He was lying in exactly this position when his left rear Goodyear tyre spectacularly exploded going down the back straight, sending his Williams FW11 bucking from side to side. He brought the machine under control and stopped at the side of the road before retreating to a caravan and the comfort of his wife. Alain Prost, his McLaren rival, won the race and the title in what was probably the most memorable grand prix of the 1980s and left us with a classic line from the BBC's commentator Murray Walker: <a href=\"http://pl.youtube.com/watch?v=0qTXbVsOP0o\">\"AND LOOK AT THAT!\"</a></p> <p>In <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pYcAoxHTves\">this later interview with Walker</a>, following his 1992 title, Mansell reveals that if he'd let the car slam into the wall they'd have ended the race at three-quarter distance and he would have been world champion.</p> <p>4) <strong>Australian grand prix, 1994</strong></p> <p>Michael Schumacher's famous two-wheel moment was the culmination of formula one's most difficult season, which had been blighted by the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola. By the Adelaide finale just two men were left in the title race \u2014 Damon Hill and Schumacher, with a point separating the pair after Hill's incredible drive to victory in the wet at the penultimate Japanese grand prix. Schumacher was leading the deciding race when, with Hill on his tail, he ran wide off the track and clipped a wall. The Benetton, wobbling, rejoined and collided with the faster Williams as Hill attempted to take the inside line at the next corner. Schumacher was tipped on to two wheels and immediately retired, while Hill's race soon finished with suspension damage from the impact.</p> <p>Given the season's events Williams did not challenge the result. Schumacher won the championship ... and Hill won BBC Sports Personality of the Year. <a href=\"http://pl.youtube.com/watch?v=3VGAWfEsQsY&amp;amp;feature=related\">This clip titled 'Injustice F1'</a> highlights what many thought about the move \u2014 that it was an unsporting attempt by Schumacher to ensure he won the title. It has come to define him in the eyes of many formula one fans, and one suspects Hill has never forgiven the dastardly German.</p> <p>5) <strong>European grand prix, 1997</strong></p> <p>Some would say that Schumacher got his comeuppance a few years later, while gunning for his first title with Ferrari, in the 17th grand prix of the year held at Jerez. Williams' upstart Jacques Villeneuve had almost won the title in his debut season the year before and was just a point behind Schumacher, having taken seven wins to the German's five. Schumacher was leading the race until Villeneuve began to overtake and, with his car's nose ahead going into a corner on the inside line, <a href=\"http://pl.youtube.com/watch?v=o2MeWpZSeL8\">Schumacher drove straight into him</a>. The Ferrari bounced off into the gravel and Schumacher furiously spun the wheels in a vain attempt to get going again. He couldn't.</p> <p>Villeneuve's Williams survived the bash and went on to take third position and the title on points. The stewards were none too happy with Schumacher and he was disqualified from that year's drivers' title for his attempt to win the title by taking out the opposition (again). It would have been the Scuderia's first crown in 18 years; instead they had to wait until the year 2000, when the Red Baron bagged the first of a string of crowns without resorting to dirty tactics.</p> <p>6) <strong>Brazilian grand prix, 2007</strong></p> <p>Alright, alright, it might seem a bit cruel to bring up last year's Hamilton-McLaren debacle, but there's no getting away from the fact that when it comes down to great formula one duels that were settled in the final race, this is one of them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\" title=\"\">Lewis Hamilton</a>, in his debut grand prix season, was hoping to complete a fairytale story and win the title \u2014 and went into Interlagos with a four-point advantage. Fernando Alonso, his team-mate and, by now, arch-enemy, was second while Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was the outsider, seven points adrift of Hamilton.</p> <p>The in-fighting that had so far failed to derail Hamilton's campaign came to a head almost immediately, as he was passed by Alonso and then ran wide and dropped down the order <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=dSz_pQmaYqg\">trying to regain the place</a>. He could have recovered but, to the horror of the British tabloid editors and TV producers, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkqloc_3GA\">he briefly slowed as a gearbox problem befell his car</a>. After pressing every button on the steering wheel 36 times it soon righted itself, but by then it was too late. Felipe Massa allowed his team-mate Raikkonen to slip through into the lead, Alonso came third and Hamilton finished seventh. Unbelievably, the crown was Raikkonen's, with Alonso and Hamilton finishing joint second in the standings, a point behind. It'll be a different matter in this year's finale. We hope.</p>",
  "<p>Who will mourn the passing of the old James Bond? Will Miss Moneypenny, now consigned to scraping a crust as a temp, speak up for those years of saucy winks and open-handed blows to the posterior? Will the ghosts of Bambi and Thumper emerge from their tombs to proclaim the wonders of a spot of slap, tickle and, ultimately, blam? </p> <p>At the moment of writing, such activities would appear unlikely. The new Bond movie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\">Quantum of Solace</a> goes to great lengths to impress upon viewers that, for Bond, the era of louche repartee, ubiquitous glamour and inappropriate touching is now over. In fact, it's almost as if the Broccoli contingent had polled a focus group of ardent Bondies, ascertained exactly what they loved about the character, then chopped it right out.</p> <p>OK, so he keeps the dinner jacket. But he's at the opera when he's wearing it and, anyway, he kills someone to get it. And the martinis might be the same (they're not stirred at least), but it's a barman who's left to articulate the specifics, as Bond, well, he's just too <a href=\"http://outnow.ch/Movies/2008/JamesBond-QuantumOfSolace/Bilder/movie.p/10\">shitfaced</a> to speak. The general point, therefore, is this: everything you knew about Bond is wrong and if it hasn't been dropped, it will slyly be mocked.</p> <p>The news of this development has disappointed many. Not me, though; not at all. Peter Bradshaw, for example, has already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/18/jamesbond1\">bemoaned</a> the lost flirtation from the film. But I care not for a sophisticated Bond and certainly not for one who hankers after the finer things in life. I'd rather have a Bond who doesn't sleep than one who snoozes in well-appointed space capsules after \"attempting re-entry\". </p> <p>Why? In the first instance, it makes for a more convincing action movie. It's that much-mentioned \"Bourne effect\" at work; Matt Damon's agent using his <a href=\"http://www.aolcdn.com/aolmovies/bourne-ultimatum-insert-caption-300a\">wits</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/movies/photos/m/2008_movie_awards/nominees_flip/bourne.jpg\">physique</a> to turn over admittedly <a href=\"http://images.tomshardware.com/2007/03/20/top_10_movie_fights/bourne_425.jpg\">unending</a> numbers of <a href=\"http://wmdeez.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/the-bourne-ultimatum.jpg\">villains</a>, where old Bond might have relied on a spring-powered poison pen. When you believe that the hero could actually be doing what the script suggests, the thrills become immediate, the tension more taut.</p> <p>There's a class thing too, though. I don't want to reduce this to an archetype more suited to a doctorate from Fulchester University and, the truth is, Bond's role as a neo-colonialist and perennial misogynist doesn't really bother me. It's more to do with the fact that I have never aspired to owning seven flash cars, to grooming myself immaculately (check the byline pic, there's proof right there) or seducing a woman with a sly wink and the hollow promise of a life in the Cotswolds.</p> <p>What's more, I doubt I'm alone in thinking like that. Not many people aspire to a life of loucheness. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a>, maybe, but as we know he makes his own rules. A cool, arrogant charm is the preserve of bankers, barristers and, probably, professional sailors. And who wants their realm protected by someone like that?</p> <p>It would seem to me that the keepers of the Bond flame have decided the same thing, and that whatever appeal a lethal playboy might once have had, that time has passed. If Bond has to be an Etonian (and legend dictates that he must), let him be an Etonian who seems awkward in his own skin, enjoys his martinis not for the glass but for the kick, and does his job solely because it has to be done. In other words: make mine Daniel Craig.</p>",
  "<p>Helping a relative to commit suicide is like racing a child who is choking on peanuts to hospital at double the legal speed limit. This is the persuasive view of <a href=\"http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/baroness-finlay/\">Baroness Finlay</a>, the crossbench peer who was instrumental in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/may/13/uk.health\">defeating a bill</a> to legalise assisted suicide in the House of Lords two years ago.</p> <p>Baroness Finlay, who has a background in palliative care, says that just because there are circumstances where people understandably break the law, this doesn't mean the law should be changed. Or to put it another way, we need, she says, \"laws with a stern face and a kind heart\".</p> <p>This is the rationale behind retaining the criminal offence of assisting suicide. No one wants to prosecute the recently bereaved who, in addition to enduring the incurable or terminal illness or a loved one, have sat beside them while they take their own life. Even prosecutors, whose instinct is understandably to take a critical view of breaking the law, baulk at the idea. They consistently decline to bring criminal proceedings in these cases, essentially interpreting the law in a compassionate way.</p> <p>This line of thinking prevailed at the high court yesterday, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/30/assisted-suicide-law\">Debbie Purdy</a>, the terminally ill MS sufferer, was defeated in her seemingly mundane request for guidelines clarifying prosecution policy. But Purdy's case is equally compelling. She says the previous tendencies of humane prosecutors are not enough. She wants certainty that her husband will be safe from the wrath of the criminal law. She would rather die alone than die without it. And if it really is the case that people in her husband's position will not be prosecuted, why not formalise this in public guidelines?</p> <p>Purdy said yesterday that she felt judges had their hands tied, and she could not have been more accurate. The court went out of its way yesterday to express sympathy for her and her husband, who have accepted her death as a certainty and are simply trying to clarify their options. </p> <p>But Purdy has encountered a constitutional brick wall. Unelected courts do their utmost to shy away from decisions that might create change where parliament has remained steadfast. They fear that allowing \"guidelines\" on assisted suicide may be a first step towards legalising it, something the House of Lords ensured did not happen just two years ago.<br> Baroness Finlay and others were instrumental in events then, when a 2005 private members bill to legalise assisted suicide was defeated. And, they insist, any new attempts to change the law will meet a similar response at the hands of the Lords. \"I opposed the last bill and I and will oppose the next\", said Lord Carlile, another anti-right to die peer.</p> <p>But the real question is what the Commons will do. \"A very significant body of public opinion\" feels that the law should be changed, the high court said yesterday, giving permission to appeal despite its belief that there was no reasonable prospect of success.</p> <p>\"Some member of the elected Commons will have to have courage to take it on as private members Bill and drive through all its stages\", Lord Carlile said yesterday. \"The effect of this on the House of Lords of that might be quite powerful.\"</p> <p>Not as powerful, it seems, as the effect this would have on those in Purdy's position, who said she \"cannot understand how 37 years down the line from the Suicide Act no one has looked at changing the law more seriously\".</p> <p>If there's one thing all parties agree on however, it's that the law will be taken seriously now. \"Only parliament can change it\" said the court yesterday. How much harder do they need to hint?</p>",

  "<p>The current financial crisis is symptomatic of a more fundamental disorder. The free market aristocrats locking their twelve pointers on the trading floor betray a peculiarly male volatility, of point scoring, dick-measuring ferocity. </p> <p>Their behaviour derives from a testosterone surge that is reproducing a hyper-male culture of medieval intensity. The core issue is gender. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/22/autism-testosterone\">Top Gear mentality</a> of inflated masculinity is apparent on pitch, screen, and page; in the boxing ring, corridor, committee, front bench and boardroom. </p> <p>It is on display in the brutalism of raunch culture with its lad mags and roasting. </p> <p>It is celebrated by the predominance of diamond geezers, jack-the-lads, slacker dudes, dumbed down fatherhood, an infantilised version of true masculinity. </p> <p>It is applauded by the moronic kindergarten blatherings of 'men' programmed into perpetual puerility by a revival of aggressive patriarchy. </p> <p>Most shamefully, it is exposed by the increasing use of rape as a means of dominance in the home and on the battlefield. </p> <p>In all these arenas, maleman struts his atavistic stuff.</p> <p>There was a time when macho-masculinity was fit for purpose. Twelve thousand years ago, during and following the thaw, we needed action man, with 'a little less conversation please'. </p> <p>As humanity struggled to survive a period of elemental chaos then establish order, structure and organisation, the soft fingers of social literacy were subordinate to the hard fist of physical control.</p> <p>This is no longer the case. There is a new ethos, in which care has priority over enterprise, the housekeeper over the entrepreneur, stewardship over expansion. </p> <p>EQ now outpoints IQ. </p> <p>Technology has transformed the work place, replacing the masculine qualities of muscle, system, specialism and dictation with the feminine aptitudes of dexterity, multi-tasking and negotiation. </p> <p>The emphasis within human organisation and business has moved from competition to collaboration, with a new emphasis on 'others'. This is seen in support systems, restorative justice, health and safety, and a therapy culture for victims, whether of trauma or disadvantage.</p> <p>The new human narrative is creating an essentially feminine paradigm. </p> <p>It is possible that the resurgence of masculinity is simply a cry of protest from a gender in decline, as it faces up to the redundancy of those qualities by which it has hitherto dominated the stage.</p> <p>The current financial crisis serves to expose the masculine model as unfit for 21st century purpose. </p> <p>Global management requires an economy of maintenance based on household need, not one of expansion driven by tribal greed. If the human vehicle is to reach a fourth millennium, then men need to take a back seat.</p>",
  "<p>The media have seized with glee upon the plight of hedge fund managers who have lost billions by short-selling VW shares. knowledge and comprehension of the events at hand were sacrificed in favour of uncontrolled delight at the outcomes. </p> <p>The drama surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/28/porsche-vw-car-industry-germany\">VW's hyper-inflated share price</a> should have been restricted to the market arena, rather than turned into a carnival freak-show act, with the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/3281888/Hedge-funds-lose-billions-as-VW-share-price-dives.html\">losing hedge funds'</a> traders playing the unwanted role of bearded ladies for the benefit of a mocking public. Of course, given the baying-for-blood atmosphere with which non-participants have been treating the City of late, that was never going to happen. Yet those who take such pleasure in the hedge funds' pain would do well to examine the root cause of their ill-intentioned joy. </p> <p>The background to the VW affair is simple enough; what is less easy to comprehend is the kicking the press and public have meted out to the losing traders whilst they were down. Those caught short of VW shares were only doing their jobs; jobs that they had every right to pursue as a means to providing a living for themselves and their families. </p> <p>But, as has been proved to be the case, because they belonged to the much-maligned minority of hedge fund managers \u2013 widely believed to be the root cause of all evil by arch-socialists, archbishops and politicians alike \u2013 they are treated as social pariahs, mocked and ridiculed at every turn, whether they make or lose money. </p> <p>I first pointed out the volatility in VW stock <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/marketturmoil.lehmanbrothers?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">six weeks ago</a>, against the backdrop of Britain's witch-hunt against short-sellers; what looked awkward then for those short of VW shares turned into a nightmare of Biblical proportions this week. Thanks to Porsche's announcement that it now controls almost 75% of VW shares, and with a further 20% of the stock controlled by the State of Lower Saxony, little more than 5% of the equity remained in free-float on the exchanges.</p> <p>With far more shares having been shorted than were available to be bought back by those wishing to cover their positions, the inevitable stampede for shares at any price meant VW stock could only go one way: and it did. Hitting an incredible level of over \u20ac1,000 per share, VW was briefly the biggest company by stock market value on Tuesday, eclipsing behemoths such as Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil. </p> <p>The combined losses suffered by several funds were estimated at being around \u20ac25bn, cueing thinly-veiled crowing in the next day's press. Porsche's release of a further 5% of the stock to help short-sellers satisfy their uncovered positions helped bring the price down to a more realistic level, but the devil isn't in the detail of the VW share price graph. The machinations of the market are, as always, best left to be devoured and digested by those who properly understand its intricacies and idiosyncracies, rather than served up to a poorly-informed public for their unsavoury enjoyment. </p> <p>Putting hedge fund managers in stocks and hurling rotten produce at them is neither productive nor prudent; especially in these troubled times, when far greater links ought to be forged between those within and without the markets' perimeter. Making lewd, crude gestures at those suffering the effects of the indices' extreme volatility is embarrassingly asinine, not to mention unhelpful when it comes to picking up the pieces of the credit crisis. </p> <p>The public's refusal to acknowledge that traders and fund managers have also suffered during this spell of market turmoil means the market players are unlikely to feel compelled to offer much sympathy to the public's plight in return, sympathy that many commentators are demanding be extended by the City on an almost-daily basis. </p> <p>Hedge funds exist to satisfy the lust for lucre of investors, and it's not only shadowy oligarchs and the landed gentry who put money into them. Plenty of ordinary members of the public have an interest in hedge funds' performances too, through the investments of insurers and high street banks. Still, the minutiae do not matter in the short term; when the press want to pounce, with the public loudly cheering them on, all that's important is the great British tradition of sticking the boot in without a second thought. </p>",
  "<p>The government was warned today not to \"backslide\" on taking measures to close the gender pay gap after a new poll showed widespread public support for tackling the issue. </p> <p>Nine out of 10 of those questioned by the Fawcett Society campaign group and the Unison trade union said the government should do more to tackle the pay gap. </p> <p>The Labour party's traditional advantage on equal pay was starting to slip, according to the report, with its lead over the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on this issue falling over the past year. </p> <p>Around two thirds said their voting choices at the next general election would be influenced by political action on equal pay.</p> <p>According to the survey, 85% of men and 93% of women said the government needed to do more to ensure women were paid the same as men for doing jobs that required the same or similar levels of skill.</p> <p>The Fawcett Society said the gender pay gap meant that women would in effect be working for free from now until the rest of the year, dubbing today \"Women's No Pay Day\". </p> <p>Equal pay campaigners want Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, to include provisions in the new equality bill to make firms hold pay audits to expose any disparities between men and women's wages. </p> <p>Katherine Rake, the Fawcett Society's director, said: \"This poll sends a clear message to Peter Mandelson that any backtracking on equality commitments is going against popular thinking. </p> <p>\"In times of economic difficulty, voters want greater support for equal pay measures, not backsliding. After all, according to the government's own figures, unlocking women's economic potential could contribute up to an astonishing 2% of GDP. </p> <p>\"With the equality bill, Lord Mandelson has an opportunity to support measures that make financial sense during this economic downturn.\"</p> <p>Bronwyn McKenna, a Unison official, said that equal pay laws were \"complex, weak and ineffective\" and needed to be updated.</p> <p>\"We know that women earn on average only 83p for every \u00a31 earned by men, 60p in the case of women part-time workers. Yet only 126 women won equal-pay cases last year, enough to fit comfortably on to two double-decker buses. The legislation must be updated.\"</p> <p>Harriet Harman, the minister for women and equality, challenged the pay-gap figure of 17% cited in the poll, as she insisted that the official figure had dropped to 12% since Labour came to power. </p> <p>But she said that the government was \"determined to do more\" to narrow the gap through the equality bill. </p> <p>Harman said: \"We will ban 'secrecy clauses' which exist in a quarter of workplaces, and make public authorities report on gender pay.</p> <p>\"We will drive equality in the private sector through public procurement and we are working with business, unions and other to make the private sector more transparent on gender pay.\"</p>",

This year, the Ugandan government began proceedings to prosecute those accused of embezzling Global Fund money, including two former health ministers. </p> <p>Aidspan, the independent watchdog that monitors Global Fund activities worldwide, said Uganda failed to satisfy the fund that the arrangements put in place after its suspension were robust enough to protect its money from misuse.</p> <p>In an interview with New Vision, an Aidspan representative said the $12m grants were now so far behind schedule that they \"become irredeemable\".</p> <p>The news comes in the same week that the <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/656833\">Uganda Aids Commission</a></strong> said Uganda requires an estimated 1.3tr Ugandan shillings ($700m) over the next 18 months to finance vital HIV/Aids activities.</p> <p>The commission said that 25% of this sum should go towards prevention and 50% towards treatment, care and delivery of drugs and services.</p> <p>This week has also seen groups representing people living with HIV and Aids <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/656841\">reject</a></strong> Uganda's new draft HIV/Aids prevention and control bill 2008.</p> <p>The draft bill criminalises the intentional transmission of HIV. The National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda said that the country should avoid creating scenarios where people living with HIV/Aids are looked on as criminals.</p> <h2>Health system criticised</h2> <p>Uganda's decentralised health system is to blame for the poor delivery of health services across the country, according to health minister Stephen Mallinga. </p> <p>Speaking at the 14th health sector joint review meeting in Kampala on Monday, Mallinga said the decentralised recruitment of health workers had led to a culture of \"tribalism\", with many health workers recruited and remaining within their own home regions, reported the <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/regional-special/Decentralisation_blamed_for_poor_health_service_73863.shtml \">Daily Monitor</a></strong>.</p> <p>This has led to an uneven distribution of qualified health workers across the country, particularly in regions with few of its own qualified medical staff. <br> Mallinga added that decentralisation was also thwarting health workers' chances of being promoted and transferred to other regions.</p> <p>\"Once you are recruited to Kisoro you are likely to be tied up there forever without getting an opportunity to upgrade and be promoted,\" he said.</p> <p>At the same meeting the Belgium ambassador to Uganda, Jan de Bruyne, warned that Uganda is off-track to meet the Millennium Development Goals on reducing child and maternal mortality as a consequence of its \"poor healthcare system\".</p> <h2>Economic troubles continue </h2> <p>Uganda's economic woes continued this week with an estimated 114bn Ugandan shillings ($54m) wiped off the local stock market in one day. </p> <p>The losses recorded on October 27 were the result of panic selling by stockbrokers in the Uganda Securities Exchange, reported the <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Investors_lose_24b_in_Kampala_in_one_day_73878.shtml\">Daily Monitor</a></strong>. Of the losses, Shs 23.6bn evaporated from six locally listed companies, including Uganda Clays, New Vision and the Bank of Baroda.</p> <p>Despite assurances from the Bank of Uganda and the government that the economy would weather the global financial downturn with minimal effect, confidence among local investors is falling.</p> <p>Last week the shilling collapsed against the dollar, falling to a low of Shs 2,200. As a result fuel prices have spiked, with a litre of petrol rising by nearly Shs 300. </p> <p>With Uganda's heavy dependency on foreign imports, prices of other goods are expected to start rising soon. </p> <p>The governor of the Bank of Uganda, Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile, attributed the scarcity of dollars to a fall in remittances from Ugandans working abroad who have lost their jobs or had their work hours cut.</p> <h2>No cut in aid to Africa</h2> <p>The global financial downturn will not see donors slash aid to Africa, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>Despite the widespread belief that western countries hit by a faltering global economy will renege on aid commitments, Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for the Africa region, says that reduction in foreign aid among donor countries is still a long way off. </p> <p>Writing on his World Bank blog last week, <strong><a href=\"http://africacan.worldbank.org/\">africacan.worldbank.org</a></strong>, he said: \"Two things need to happen for the crisis to lead to a significant reduction in foreign aid. First, the financial crisis has to lead to a major recession in donor countries. Second, the recession leads to such fiscal constraints that foreign aid is cut.\"</p> <p>He argued that the world is not yet at this stage of economic decline and that aid is motivated largely by non-economic factors.</p> <p>His comments followed an appeal from the chairman of the African Union, the Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete, to the west not to cut aid to Africa.</p> <p>Concerns have been also raised by Uganda's Central Bank that Uganda will face deep cuts in development funding as donor countries pour millions into shoring up faltering financial institutions. </p> <p>This week some of the world's largest NGOs confirmed they were revising budgets, cutting staff and reviewing their 2009 programmes of funding and activity. </p> <p>Robert Zachritz, World Vision's director of advocacy and government relations, told <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200810271825.html\">IRIN news</a></strong> he believed micro-credit programmes could be particularly hit. </p> <p>\"Much of this [micro-finance credit] relies on getting loans from banks, which is going to be a real challenge in the near future. Losing this credit is a huge problem for the world's poor, small-scale farmers.\"</p> <h2>Carbon finance for African farmers</h2> <p>Environmental experts are examining ways in which the billions of dollars available under the Kyoto Protocol could be used to help improve the lives of farmers across Africa.</p> <p>Earlier this week, more than 100 experts from five continents met in the US to discuss ways in which carbon finance could be used to help fund <strong><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000947/index.html\">agricultural development in some of the world's poorest countries</a></strong>. </p> <p>Carbon finance has been developed under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), whereby industrialised nations can fulfil their commitments to reducing their carbon footprint by investing in emission-saving projects overseas. </p> <p>To qualify for funding, agricultural projects in Africa would have to be able to scientifically prove how much they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional farming methods.</p> <p>Issues debated at the meeting included the potential for new sustainable production intensification (SPI) technology that would reduce tilling of land, which releases CO2 trapped in the soil into the atmosphere.</p> <p>According to news agency IRIN, systems under discussion include Conservation Agriculture, a method where seeds are drilled directly into the ground. </p> <p>\"This is a win-win-win opportunity,\" said Theodor Friedrich, an expert in SPI. \"We have a chance to slow climate change, help poor farmers make a better living and improve soil health and productivity all at the same time.\"</p> <p>He pointed out that developing non-tillage methods of farming would directly benefit small-hold farmers in Africa as soil that is rich in carbon is also more adaptable to the higher temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall that are the expected outcomes of global climactic change.</p>",
  "<p>One of the Pitts is said to have replied, when told he was ruining the country, that there was a lot of ruin in a country. So it is with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which, if one believes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>, is broken, socially and economically, to which might be added constitutionally and politically as well if one goes along with the guidance paragraph for this article set out by <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings</a>: \"The economic crisis has temporarily derailed the Conservatives. The New Labour project is exhausted and its electoral coalition has been breaking up. The political status quo has vanished and as the crisis unfolds conditions now exist for a new kind of social and democratic settlement.\" Well, yes, but perhaps not quite in the way Soundings might wish.</p> <p>It is widely accepted that the 11 years of New Labour government have been essentially Thatcherism mark two. It will be followed, subsequent to a general election held sometime in the next 18 months and short of a military putsch by the Guards Brigade backed by the Daily Mail, by Thatcherism mark three. The possible variants to this succession (Conservatives by a good majority, Labour by a small one, a hung parliament inclining to Labour etc) will be of interest to political buffs but of precious little importance to anyone else, at least in England, as the policies of the two main parties will remain essentially identical \u2013 that is, a form of neoliberal economism philosophically and morally based upon Hayek. The only change will be a veneer of Keynes tilted towards state support of business. Election of the Conservatives will, probably, be followed by rapid moves towards Scottish independence, which would be regretfully accepted. A Labour administration would fight harder for the Union. Any variant will struggle. In the teeth of a vicious recession, with the national debt at huge levels and banks struggling to buy back government shareholdings, they will find it difficult to find policies to reduce unemployment and social deprivation. The main reason for this is that any form of Keynesian reflation will be severely limited by the appalling state of public finances and personal debt. There will be quite serious public disorder associated with this, probably with a racist element.</p> <p>The result will be that around 2012, England (with Wales and, possibly, Northern Ireland being dragged along) will be ready for a genuine switch in national governance which will, most probably, take the form of a slide, possibly quite dramatically, into a form of authoritarian state-control, which might be called neo-fascism though its actual name will be something with \"national\" in its title. This could be accomplished with surprising ease \u2013 Britain is, after all, one of the few countries, perhaps the only democracy, whose national legislature can, quite legally, suspend elections for so long as it sees fit and which now has all the necessary trappings for a police state. </p> <p>The only feasible alternative to this would be the formation of the grand coalition, which has for some years now hovered in the wings of the Westminster theatre. Just who plays the parts of Ramsay Mac and Baldwin is immaterial, the result would be the merging of most of the Labour and Conservatives in parliament plus some Lib Dems and the effective uniting of their parties outside it. Some form of rightwing party might well peel away from the Conservatives and, possibly, a remnant of the Labour left might negotiate with other left groups to begin the task of forming an electable party by, say, 2020. If, that is, England is then still holding elections.</p> <p>Sorry, but that is about the best on offer. One possible alternative would be to distribute copies of the works of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/trotsky_leon.shtml\">Trotsky</a> to junior officers in the Guards Brigade on the grounds that it worked for Chavez. But it is a long shot. My only concrete proposal is the formation of The Red Tomato Group. These undercover subversives would vow to track down all on the left who ever uttered or wrote any of the phrases \"reach out for new alliances\", \"think radical new policies\", \"define a new politics\" and suchlike without at the same time providing at least 1,000 words on exactly and concretely what they mean. The RTG would pelt all such with ripe tomatoes until they repented. The leaders of the RTG would, of course, soon be arrested under counter-terrorist legislation and detained without trial for the 142 days allowed. This would allow plenty of time for demonstrations at which we could all chant \"Free, Free the RTG Three\". It might not achieve much but we do lack a good chant. \"Gordon, Gordon, Gordon, Out, Out, Out,\" really does not cut it.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free &amp; Soundings journal, will take place in London at Kings Place on November 3 at 7pm.

But can it work the other way round? Maybe. Think of top model, Milla Jovovich who seems to have successfully accomplished a whole host of creative ventures: anything from producing her own folk music album in 1994 (it gained critical acclaim apparently, despite being recorded by Milla at age 16 and her inspiration being <a href=\"http://www.millaj.com/bio.shtml\">a love of elves and magic trees</a>) to what people thought would be her breakthrough role as Leeloo in Luc Besson's The Fifth Element \u2026 until Joan of Arc bombed a couple of years later.</p> <p>But Milla's failure hasn't deterred Tom Ford, former creative director at the Gucci Group, who is to make his <a href=\"http://www.drapersonline.com/news/2008/10/tom_ford_to_direct_new_film.html\">directorial debut</a> in a film adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's 1964 novel A Single Man penned by Ford and David Scearce. The film, which follows a single day in a professor's life in Los Angeles, will reportedly star Colin Firth, Julianne Moore and Matthew Goode. We can't wait to see if Ford's creative flair works as well on the big screen as it does on the catwalk. </p> <h2>BANG ON TREND</h2> <p><strong>Tailored jackets</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339150074\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/30/LivTyler140x200.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Tyler at the opening of the new Burberry store in Los Angeles\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liv Tyler.

  "<p>It may have taken seven years for the Flaming Lips' first feature film, Christmas on Mars, to be released on DVD. But the band are busy making the wait worthwhile. According to a promotional video at the <a href=\"http://www.flaminglips.com\">Flaming Lips website</a>, \"Mega Deluxe Editions\" of Christmas on Mars come not only with DVD, CD, t-shirt, trading cards, bumper sticker and souvenir \"ticket\" - they also come with \"real Flaming Lips popcorn\" stuffed inside a \"real\" Flaming Lips popcorn box. Whereas some bands would just hire a Korean factory to manufacture pre-boxed popcorn, Coyne and his friends are committed to a home-made popcorn popping-and-stuffing process - while dressed in psychedelic costumes. </p> <p>The Flaming Lips have been working since 2001 on their hallucinogenic sci-fi film, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/08/news.culture\">debuted at music festivals this summer</a>. Whereas the group is known for its splendid, joyous gigs, Coyne warned that the movie is not quite so jubilant - in fact, it's downright arty. </p> <p>\"When you go see a movie that cost $100m to make, that movie should always be good,\" Coyne told the LA Times. \"For $100m it should never suck, even if you don't agree with it ... But I knew going into this we didn't know what we were doing. We were just doing whatever came to our minds, and so this could really just be dumb, boring arty bull.\"</p> <p>Instead of the zinging pop with which the Lips now ply their trade, Christmas on Mars's soundtrack reflects the band's earlier, experimental days. \"I wouldn't play this to an 18-year-old who wants to rock,\" Coyne said. \"I wouldn't say, 'You got to check this out! It's deep and moving!' I understand this is strange, abstract, moody weirdness. But we would have felt really frustrated if we couldn't just go in every tangent we got obsessed with. If we weren't able to pursue this, we'd be an old bitter rock group, or at least more bitter than we are now.\"</p> <p>The frontman has expressed the worry that, as an ageing rock-group, the Flaming Lips might get locked \"into one groove\". \"Even Radiohead, as much as I like their last three or four records ... there's a colouring and a shade that they sound like, and which they'll probably move through time sounding like ... We never really wanted to be like that. We just keep finding new things we want to explore.\"</p> <p>The Flaming Lips aren't planning to emulate Radiohead's business plan, either. The group's next album - which they hope to finish in time for a summer tour - is their last on contract for Warner Bros. Yet Coyne sees no need for them to set out on their own, as Radiohead did for In Rainbows. \"I think we'd only leave because there's not a reason to stay,\" Coyne said. \"Warner Bros really has believed in us ... If they restructure the way they deal with bands in the next couple years, I'm sure they'll be thinking of ways that will work for us and them. But our deal with Warner Bros isn't something we're waiting to get out of. We're not waiting to show them who's boss.\"</p> <p>Besides, they're too busy making popcorn.</p>",
  "<p>All religions can be cranked up for political purposes to be murderous and brutal towards the \"other\". Hinduism generally has a tolerant and non-militant image, but this has been punctured by cyclical violence against India's minorities be they Muslim, Christian or \"untouchables\", now known as dalits. Right now, fanatics sanctioned by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have been perpetrating violence against Christians in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/28/religion-india-hindus-christians\">Orissa</a>, east India. Approximately 60 people have been killed over a two month period.</p> <p>Against this backdrop comes a moving and thoughtful film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/lff/firaaq\">Firaaq</a>, by Nandita Das, an established actor, social activist and first-time director. Shown at the London Film Festival, it focuses on the aftermath of violence in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_violence\">Gujarat</a> in 2002 in which thousands were killed and many women raped. Through six vignettes which represent a cross-section of class, community and gender without ever appearing to be schematic, the film depicts the confusion, tension, prejudices, humanity and pain of a community trying to come to terms with the horror of what has happened.</p> <p>This is an important film which should lend urgency to the debate that India is having about the lack of protection it provides to its religious minorities. The danger is that in an explosive and polarised situation, its message will not be heard or understood. Even in the polite atmosphere of London film festival audiences, the question and answer session betrayed the discomfort of those who identified as Hindus and tried to dismiss the film by saying that it lacked analysis, balance or that it was not political enough. This may have been code for the fact that the film had not referred to the \"trigger\" for the violence \u2013 the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2802591.stm\">Godhra incident</a> where a train full of Hindu activists was set alight. Two high-level inquiries into this incident came to diametrically opposite conclusions: one concluded that the fire was accidental and the second that it was arson.</p> <p>The same debate is now raging over the violence in Orissa, which has been justified by VHP officials as a response to the alleged killing by Christians of a VHP leader, although the police say that the murder was carried out by Maoist insurgents. Whatever the truth may be, surely the triggering incident should be dealt with by the forces of law and order and not vigilante mobs being whipped into a frenzy by politicians.</p> <p>Nandita Das wants the issues debated and the film to be seen as widely as possible. It is almost certain that Hindu nationalists will mobilise against it as they did when she played the role of an unhappy housewife engaged in a lesbian love affair with her sister-in-law in Deepa Mehta's film, Fire (1996) and members of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/227210.stm\">Shiv Sena</a> in Mumbai vandalised cinemas saying that lesbianism does not exist in Hindu families. They said that they would have left the film alone if lesbianism had been depicted in a Muslim family.</p> <p>How can art intervene in such a polarised situation? Can those stuck in a fanatical mindset be moved to condemnation of the treatment of India's minorities? One audience member felt that the truth of Firaaq would be dismissed because of who Nandita Das is \u2013 she would say that, wouldn't she? I would argue, however, that because it has been made by someone from a Hindu background, it is much harder to dismiss than if it had been made by a Muslim. Much as we who see ourselves as secular might hate to even reference our religious identities, they adopt a huge significance when the chasm is so wide and the need for a bridge so pressing.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities and aid workers are scrambling to try and find survivors and help the thousands displaced after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/natural-disasters-pakistan\">earthquake in Pakistan yesterday</a>.</p> <p>As the death toll rose to 215, emergency workers scoured the rubble and mountain areas of impoverished Baluchistan province in south-west Pakistan, near the Afghan border. Reports are still coming in from the outlying areas of more people killed from the 6.5 magnitude quake, which demolished an estimated 2,000 homes in a string of villages.</p> <p>The Red Cross said it was distributing 2,500 tents while a medical team with a tonne of supplies was helping overcrowded hospitals. Marco Succi, a Red Cross spokesman, said: \"Overall we think the situation is under control, though there is urgent need for shelter and blankets because it is freezing up there.\"</p> <p>Many people were too scared to sleep even in undamaged homes because of aftershocks, he said.</p> <p>The US and Germany have offered to help but officials say they can cope without a big international aid effort.</p> <p>News agencies said at least three hardline Islamic organisations were quick to help quake survivors. Among them was Jamaat-ud-Dawa, designated a terrorist group by the US government for links to Muslim separatists fighting in India's portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p> <p>The group set up relief camps and won friends among survivors when a bigger quake devastated Kashmir and northern Pakistan in October 2005, killing about 80,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.</p> <p>Yesterday, the army flew in supplies and medical teams into the hard-hit Ziarat district, where an estimated 15,000 people have been left homeless. Hospitals are treating dozens of seriously injured people.</p> <p>Last night, officials said several thousand people slept in tents erected by the military. Soldiers were unable to reach all the surrounding regions before temperatures plunged to freezing.</p> <p>Impatient crowds gathered in the hillside hamlet of Kawas as they awaited soldiers to distribute blankets, tents and jackets. Others slept in the open near the rubble of their mud and stone houses.</p> <p>\"We passed the night shivering and with the children crying. There were five of us wrapped in one blanket,\" said Ala Uddin, a 30-year-old farmer camped with about 15 relatives in an apple orchard.</p> <p>The earthquake comes at an unstable time for Pakistan as the civilian government battle al-Qaida and Taliban attacks as well as a looming financial crisis.</p>",

We had such fun, didn't we? Perhaps you should consider handing over your sonic screwdriver to one of the following \u2026 <br></p> <p>It is a shame that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/30/doctorwho-television\">Tennant is leaving Doctor Who</a>. The programme has been fantastic over the past four years, largely due to how he took the role by the scruff of the neck, incorporated aspects of his predecessors, but made it his own. What were your favourite Tennant moments?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.paddypower.com/bet?action=go_event&amp;category=SPECIALS&amp;class_sort=--&amp;ev_id=775393&amp;ev_class_id=72&amp;ev_type_id=7771&amp;force_racing_css=N\">Betting shop Paddy Power has a list of contenders to become the next doctor</a>, which I only mention to discount it. It puts Paterson Joseph, who appeared as Roderick in the Doctor Who episodes Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways, as favourite at 3-1 to become the first black Doctor Who.</p> <p>But BBC Wales, which produces <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/\">Doctor Who</a>, has not even begun searching for a replacement.</p> <p>The problem with such lists is that every utterance on this subject has usually been refracted through second-guessing what executive producer Russell T Davies thinks.</p> <p>Thus Davies makes a favourable comment about Russell Tovey, who appeared in the play The History Boys and his role as Midshipman Frame in the Kylie Minogue Christmas special, Voyage of the Damned, and he is suddenly a contender.</p> <p>In the end, it is really incoming executive producer Steven Moffat's decision. And he has barely said anything about anything.</p> <p>Here is the beginnings of a list, which I hope you can continue.</p> <p><strong>Bill Nighy </strong></p> <p>Missed out when the role went to Christopher Eccleston. Was superb and somewhat doctorish as the newspaper editor in State of Play.<br><strong><br>Stephen Fry </strong></p> <p>Would be hugely popular in the role. And talented enough to mould the part into something new. But would the ultimate renaissance man surrender 10 months of his life and his plethora of TV appearances for a single part? Eccleston found it gruelling and left after just one year. </p> <p><strong>Alexander Armstrong <br></strong><br>At a loose end now that he has pulled out of hosting Countdown at the 11th hour. But the Doctor as a hooray henry?</p> <p><strong>James Nesbitt</strong></p> <p>The Cold Feet star has been connected with the role, even on the pages of MediaGuardian.co.uk, but it is hard to see fans warming to him.</p> <p><strong>Rupert Penry-Jones</strong></p> <p>His time in Spooks makes it clear that he would be an action man, but is he too pretty to play a Timelord?</p> <p><strong><br>Paul O'Grady </strong></p> <p>Jon Pertwee was a comic actor before he took the role, but he played the third Doctor completely straight. O'Grady would be an out there choice, but probably unaffordable. I don't know why the idea appeals to me.</p> <p>Tom Baker left the programme in 1981, and he had a bit of fun at his press conference by wishing the next doctor luck \"whomever he or she is\". This leading to a frenzy of speculation that the next doctor could be a woman. Is now the right time? </p> <p><strong>Joanna Lumley </strong></p> <p>She was mentioned as a candidate to replace Baker but producers were never that serious about the idea and Peter Davison won the role. After her star turn in the 1999 Comic Relief special, the Curse of Fatal Death, written by Steven Moffat, the idea is even more attractive now. </p> <p><strong>Alex Kingston</strong> </p> <p>Put in a sterling performance as Professor River Song in the Silence in the Library. And handing the role to someone who has previously appeared in the series has a precedent \u2013 sixth Doctor Colin Baker appeared as a guard in the series, even shooting his predecessor, the fifth Doctor.</p> <p>Every actor in Britain would kill for the role. But the person who lands it may well surprise us.</p>",
  "<p>In the centre of Belfast this Sunday there will be two parallel political struggles taking place on the street.</p> <p>The first is the conflict between the city's republican community and the pro-British unionist one. The former are turning out in force to protest against a homecoming parade in honour of local troops who have served in British army regiments in Afghanistan and Iraq. The latter are expected to travel from all over Northern Ireland in defiance of those protests and demonstrate their support for the British soldiers. </p> <p>Battle lines are drawn and the rhetoric between the two sides is becoming more bellicose by the day. Unionists such as the DUP leader and Northern Ireland first minister, Peter Robinson, have warned that the republican protests are a recipe for disaster. </p> <p>Meanwhile Sinn F\u00e9in has urged the Ministry of Defence to call off the rally, which the party says will offend many nationalists and republicans opposed to the British army's presence in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>What is at stake is the fragile coalition based at Stormont, which was already unstable due to Sinn F\u00e9in's refusal to allow a power-sharing executive meeting to sit since June. Moreover, the prospect of Sinn F\u00e9in's key demand, the devolution of policing and justice powers, being met \u2013 which would trigger an executive meeting \u2013 seems more remote than ever. </p> <p>The row about a parade has soured relations not only between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in but within wider Northern Irish society. Old sectarian tensions and mistrust have bubbled up to the surface once more through the fissures caused by the row erupting over Sunday's march.</p> <p>So why is Northern Ireland's political miracle threatening to unravel? The answer to that question lies in the second parallel struggle that will be played out this Sunday in central Belfast. </p> <p>There will actually be three separate republican demonstrations at three different locations this Sunday. </p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in has organised the largest and the party has vowed that their protest will be silent and dignified. The party has abided by the law in the sense that it applied for permission from the Parades Commission (the body that oversees controversial public events) to hold its rally. </p> <p>A second protest has been organised by \"Eirigi\", a relatively new republican pressure group comprised of many former disillusioned Sinn F\u00e9in members opposed to the party's participation in government with the DUP and its new support for policing. A third smaller demonstration will be staged by the Irish Republican Socialist party, the political wing of terror group the INLA.</p> <p>The presence of two republican organisations who are against the current political compromise in Northern Ireland is evidence of why Sinn F\u00e9in had to gamble and hold its protest rally. One veteran republican dissident from Derry who spoke to the Guardian this week succinctly summed up the challenge posed to Sinn F\u00e9in:</p> <blockquote> <p>The thing to watch are the numbers. This is a battle over numbers. If Eirigi brings a big crowd to their protest it will unnerve Sinn F\u00e9in. </p> </blockquote> <p>In other words Sinn F\u00e9in is trying to hold that part of republican space that could be potentially occupied by its former radical, street-fighting element. </p> <p>There is a lot at stake for Sinn F\u00e9in this weekend, though, besides trying to still appear edgy and revolutionary in order to fend off accusations of reformism and sell-out. </p> <p>The party has captured a whole new constituency of aspirational, middle-class Catholic voters who are less turned on by the politics of street protest than their old base. A large proportion of this new Sinn F\u00e9in electorate will spend the Halloween weekend either behind closed doors in their semi-d's or travelling up to Donegal to holiday homes, hotels and B&amp;Bs. Few if any of them will turn out to confront the British army and the thousands of unionists who will be out cheering them on. </p> <p>Will a serious confrontation in the city centre alienate those new nationalist voters who want to see peace on the streets and power-sharing at Stormont?</p> <p>At a macro level, the controversy over the welcome-home parade illuminates a wider dilemma for Sinn F\u00e9in about where it is going. </p> <p>Out of power in Dublin and strategically outflanked by the DUP since the St Andrews agreement two years ago, the party might be tempted back to the strategy of tension, to use the threat of violent street protest to exact fresh concessions from the British government. </p> <p>The trouble with this is that it risks provoking the very sectarian conflict Sinn F\u00e9in (alongside others, including working-class loyalists) has been successfully preventing in flashpoint areas all around Belfast in recent years. </p> <p>On Sunday the numbers each protest gathers and the behaviour of them will be an important moment in post-peace process history.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Henry McDonald's new book on Irish republicanism, Gunsmoke and Mirrors, is published by Gill and Macmillan</strong></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">London film festival</a> comes to a close this evening with a showing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/23/3\">Danny Boyle</a>'s much-fancied new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126911/slumdog.millionaire\">Slumdog Millionaire</a>, a drama about an 18-year-old orphan from Mumbai coming heart-stoppingly close to winning the big prize on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? </p> <p>For me, this has been an accessible, stimulating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals\">festival</a>, richly and inventively programmed. The LFF is never easy for a working London-based critic, because there are all the regular releases to cover as well, but I think it is the best I can remember for a while. And this is because I consciously set out to find and (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/oct/16/flame-citron-london-film-festival\">where I could</a>) blog about some left-field films. I hoped for serendipitous discoveries and, as it were, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/09/london.film.festival.sono.viva\">news-bulletins from creative minds around the world</a>.</p> <p>El Cielo, la Tierra, y la Lluvia - or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126807/sky.the.earth.and.the.rain\">The Sky, the Earth and the Rain</a> - by the 33-year-old Chilean film-maker Jos\u00e9 Luis Torres Leiva is a case in point. This fine film has another screening at the LFF tonight, and I would urge anyone with the time and the inclination to give it a try. It is the work of someone who unapologetically sees cinema as an art form, for whom the conventional certainties of drama and speech are subordinate to visual composition and the elusive mysteries of mood and feeling.</p> <p>The film is about a lonely and melancholy young woman, Ana (Julieta Figueroa), who lives in a wild and remote area of south-central Chile. At home, she looks after her bedridden and all-but catatonic mother, and every day takes the mainland ferry to work in a drugstore. She appears to be in the habit of giving the wrong change, and there seems to be money missing from the till. Has she been stealing? Is it a cry for help? Many questions are left unanswered. Anyway, Ana soon needs a new job, and winds up working for Toro (Pablo Kr\u00f6gh). This tough, grizzled loner, whose existence has been introduced to the film in parallel with Ana's, roams restlessly about the landscape doing a little rough shooting.</p> <p>The overwhelming impression of the film is one in which human character and human agency are not as important as the landscape: lush and sensual and fiercely, vividly present, by turns a dense and heavily wooded prospect and then a seeping, dripping wetland. It is as if human drama is the background for the natural world, rather than the other way around.</p> <p>It is becoming a bit of a journalistic cliche to describe films as painterly, but I certainly think that this film is most rewarding if it is looked at in the way you might look at a painting, not waiting for dramatic revelations or resolutions, but simply responding to composition and mood. It can be exasperating to be told that a film places jigsaw pieces in front of us, and leaves it up to the viewer to decide where, or if, the picture adds up. But I think Torres Leiva's film doesn't ask that particularly: it just asks us to participate in the mystery, a mystery in which a human face can be as unreadable as the bark of a tree or the surface of a lake. An intriguing, and beautifully made film.</p>",
  "<p>Laurent Nkunda, the renegade general whose offensive has created panic in the eastern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/30/congo\">Congolese</a> town of Goma, portrays himself as the protector of ethnic Tutsis after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rwanda\">Rwandan</a> genocide of 1994.</p> <p>But to many Congolese he is nothing more than a warlord. The UN security council last night unanimously condemned Nkunda and demanded that his <a href=\"http://www.cndp-congo.org/index-en.php\">National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP)</a> end its operations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339147434\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/04/22/nkunda.jpg\" alt=\"Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda stands in his mountain near Goma\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congo rebel leader Laurent Nkunda.

The provincial capital of North Kivu province is a trade hub that sits near the crossroads of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, <br>Rwanda and Uganda.</p> <p>His previous attacks were foiled by UN peacekeepers who used helicopters against his rebels. This time, Nkunda has spoken of \"liberating\" the entire country, although last night the rebels announced a \"unilateral ceasefire\" to avoid panic in Goma. The government in Kinshasa can only be too aware the region gave birth to the rebellion that overthrew the notorious dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.</p> <p>Nkunda has been a soldier since 1993. Although he was born in Congo, he fought with the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the rebel movement formed by Rwandan Tutsi exiles that seized control of Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide.</p> <p>Afterwards, Nkunda, who has studied psychology, returned to Congo where in 1998 he became senior officer in the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy Goma (RCD-Goma), one of the main rebel groups fighting in Congo.</p> <p>Congo's wars killed 5 million people. When they supposedly ended in 2003, the RCD joined the national army of the transitional government. Nkunda was made a general in 2004. But he refused to report to Kinshasa as part of the new integrated army and withdrew with hundreds of his former troops to the forests of Masisi in North Kivu.</p> <p>In August 2005, Nkunda declared the Congolese government corrupt and incompetent and called for its overthrow. Nkunda maintains that his group exists to protect the Congolese Tutsi, known locally as Banyamulenge, from the Hutu remnants who fled to eastern Congo after the Rwandan genocide. Independent investigations say there have been some attacks on Banyamulenge but not to the extent the general claims.</p> <p>Nkunda has clashed repeatedly with government forces. In September 2005 the Congolese government issued an international warrant for his arrest. He is blamed for war crimes and serious human rights abuses over the past three years. The Human Rights Watch group has documented summary executions, torture, and rape committed by soldiers under Nkunda's command.</p> <p>Congolese officials have accused Rwanda of backing Nkunda in an attempt to turn eastern Congo into a buffer zone. Officials in Rwanda have denied this, though tensions along the border are building.</p> <p>The countries have accused each other of cross-border attacks and there are fears the current tension could spark a wider war with Nkunda at its centre.</p>",
  "<p>The history of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/photography\">photography</a> is littered with salvage stories - of one photographer rescuing and preserving the archive of another. Probably the greatest of these is the story of Berenice Abbott, a young American portrait photographer living in Paris during the 1920s, an ex-student, like Lee Miller, of Man Ray. In 1925 she became friendly with an old French street photographer, who was a neighbour of Ray's in Montparnasse, and finally she asked if she could take his portrait. He agreed. She took the pictures, printed them - one front view, one side view - and took them to show him the results. But in that short time, she discovered, he had died. His archive had been left to a friend, Andr\u00e9 Calmettes, who sold off 2,000 prints almost immediately. Abbott decided to buy the rest. In the autumn of 1928 she took receipt of 1,500 glass-plate negatives and around 8,000 prints, and the following year, when she returned to New York, she took the archive with her. Forty years later it was bought by the Museum of Modern Art and thus the work of Eug\u00e8ne Atget, one of the greatest of all photographers, was saved.</p> <p>Abbott was not a rich woman and for most of her career she struggled to make a living. To maintain the archive, she was forced to sell a share of it to the gallery owner, Julien Levy. Nevertheless, she had preserved, ordered and published Atget's pictures, while continuing her own work, almost up to her death in 1991 at the age of 93.</p> <p>By the time her photographs were valued, she was in her 70s. She is most famous for a series of pictures that in their way link back to Atget's great project, the documenting of areas of \"old Paris\" that were being cleared to make way for the new city. But whereas Atget's pictures record the passing of places he loved, Abbott's project, Changing New York, was filled with the optimism of the post-Depression era when there were jobs again, particularly in construction: new skyscrapers, new cars, new roads, new bridges. There were jobs for artists, too, and the majority of Abbott's New York photographs were taken between 1935 and 1939 when she received funding from the Federal Art Project, the creative arm of Roosevelt's New Deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339121461\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/29/Abbott_roads.jpg\" alt=\"Berenice Abbott\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New cars, new roads, new bridges. Photograph: Berenice Abbott, published by Steidl</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berenice Abbot (Steidl)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this is described in a new two-volume edition of Abbott's photographs which, in the visual equivalent of remastering, have been scanned and digitally rendered by the printer and publisher Gerhard Steidl at the request of Ron Kurtz, an American industrialist and photography collector who bought Abbott's archive from her in 1985.<br> The volumes are divided by subject: the first contains her portraits, including the Paris portraits made in the 1920s; her pictures of what might be termed the \"wider America\", made on journeys across the country, sometimes on assignment, between 1935 and 1983; and her scientific pictures, many of which were made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. These are technical illustrations of different scientific phenomena: wave patterns, the strobe of a bouncing ball, the trajectory of a spinning wrench, the effect of light through a prism. They are reminiscent of Man Ray's \"rayograms\", photographs of simple objects against a black background, which he would move in the process to make a ghostly, abstract shape. Abbott's enthusiasm made the genre her own: in an age of technological advancement, photography, she believed, could be the \"friendly interpreter\" between science and the layman.</p> <p>This first volume also includes an essay by Hank O'Neal, a photographer and music producer who first met Abbott in New York in 1972 and remained a friend until her death, and ends with a lecture Abbott gave at the Aspen Institute in 1951 in which she lays down her beliefs about photography. She dismisses pictorialism, the affected \"painterly\" photographic style that was popular in the early 20th century, and advocates straight photography, quoting Goethe to describes its greatest aim: to record \"the truth of reality\".<br> Volume two is devoted to Changing New York. It was a hugely ambitious and physically dangerous undertaking that needed a good deal of planning and organisation: how to find the right vantage point, how to gain access to a building, how to lug an enormous plate camera and the rest of her equipment up dozens of floors, how to calculate the wind resistance, the level of light, the depth of field, how to get the required grounds in focus. The importance of the correct vantage point was not only for distance but to accentuate the tight layering and juxtaposition of buildings in the city; to show the difference in tempo between the older, sedate, low-rise blocks with their generously spaced windows, railings, front steps and pedimented front doors and the skyscrapers rising up behind them, with narrow, tightly spaced windows in rapidly ascending rows, each row syncopated by the rhythm of blinds - open, half-open, tightly shut - or by the lights, on, off, all over the city as darkness fell. </p> <p>One of her most famous pictures - so famous it has become almost a postcard cliche - is still breathtakingly beautiful within the context of this book. Nightview New York was taken from a window of the Empire State Building at 4.30pm in December 1932. It required a 15-minute exposure, and as Abbott comments, \"I'm surprised the negative is as sharp as it is because these buildings do sway a bit.\" She had to get it right on the first try because by 5pm people would start going home and the lights would go out. It had been hard - as it often was - to get permission to work inside the building at all. \"They always thought you wanted to commit suicide and superintendents were always tired, lazy and annoyed. They usually had to be bribed.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339121462\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/29/Abbott_bridge-copy-2.jpg\" alt=\"Berenice Abbott\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fabric of construction. Photograph: Berenice Abbott, published by Steidl</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berenice Abbot (Steidl)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She photographed the city through the fabric of its construction: through high metal girders, from the bedrock of foundations, along the narrow \"canyons\" of Manhattan, cast into darkness by the shadows of a sunny day. She used the narrow gaps between the high-rise buildings as a funnel to direct the viewer's attention into the far distance where an iron bridge might be just visible in the mist. She was intoxicated by the city, by the upward motion of its growth, though this did not mean she avoided its poverty. She photographed in Brooklyn, in Harlem, on the Bowery and the Lower East Side. On a deserted street in Brooklyn, she found a black woman and her two children stranded on a patch of waste ground, as if their lives had been blasted by an atomic bomb. \"When I set up my camera, no one paid any attention to me,\" Abbott said. \"I still found it difficult to photograph scenes like this; poverty distresses me very much.\" </p> <p>Like Batman, she was able to look down on Gotham from a great height. And what she saw was New York's enterprise: its advertising hoardings and neon signs, its cars, its gas stations, the elegant 1930s Greyhound terminal with the buses berthed along its sides like great liners at a quay. But she also found a place for the neighbourhoods where commerce still survived, as it did in Atget's Paris, at street level. Some pictures here, particularly her early studies of old low-rise New York, reveal the lovely detailing of residential blocks and storefronts, more reminiscent of the city she had just left behind than the one she was about to take on.</p> <p>Abbott's black-and-white photographs are usually printed with strong contrast to emphasise the graphic way she uses the fabric of a building - girders, pillars, beams and fire escapes - to reflect the dynamic of its construction. These new digital scans lose none of that emphasis, but use it more subtly, with many more gradations of grey. </p> <p>Everything about these books is in the best taste: good paper, binding, boards and a slipcase to protect them. They have been put together with the dedication of fans. The one sadness is that the text was not given a final proofing: the first volume has some misspelled names and typographical slips that, in a minor way, let the enterprise down. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339122975\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/29/bill_wood.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Wood, chest x-ray demonstration, 1955 \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chest X-ray demonstration, 1955.

Unlike Abbott, only 14 years his senior, Wood obliged almost anybody, or anything with a photograph: dogs, weddings, new houses, a rib-eye steak, a funeral parlour, legal evidence (why else would he have photographed the bruises on a woman's leg?), black children, nuns, Masonic brethren in full rig with aprons and pendants.<br> Bill Wood's Business is an edited selection of nearly 300 photographs from the archive, most dating from the 1950s and early 1960s. They present an eerie corollary to the Americans as seen by Robert Frank. Here, people look cheerful, communal, upright, proud; but they also look like cut-out figures in a cardboard landscape. As Keaton writes, when she first looked through the archive, \"Everything looked ordinary, maybe too ordinary, more like odd, or funny, but not really funny, sort of flat.\" Behind their cheerful facades is the whiff of the America of Death of a Salesman and Revolutionary Road: that era of promise and disappointment.</p> <p>Keaton eventually donated the archive to the International Centre of Photography in New York. This book, produced by ICP, includes an excellent essay by the curator and historian Marvin Heiferman and a bemused introduction by Diane Keaton. Once you get past the fun of them, the photographs, like the era, suggest something much darker going on underneath.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.steidlville.com/books/781-Berenice-Abbott.html\">Berenice Abbott</a>, two volumes, is published by Steidl, \u00a370.<br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.steidlville.com/books/775-Bill-Wood-s-Business.html\">Bill Wood's Business</a> by Diane Keaton and Marvin Heifermann is published by ICP/Steidl, \u00a325.</p>",
  "<p>Would you want to control the manner of your own death if you had acquired a disease for which there was no cure and faced a protracted, painful end? It's trickier than you may think.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/30/assisted-suicide-law\">Judges yesterday knocked back Debbie Purdy's application to the high court</a> seeking to protect her husband from prosecution if he ever helped her on her final journey. </p> <p>The judges were sympathetic, but said the law that makes assisted suicide illegal remains the law. Changing it had to be a matter for parliament, they told her. Yet politicians always shy away from this one \u2013 as the judges must know.<br><br>Purdy, 45, is has multiple sclerosis and has not yet made up her mind what to do, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/30/assisted-suicide-law\">today's sensitive report of the court case by Afua Hirsch and Audrey Gillan in the Guardian</a>. </p> <p>But she knows that if her husband, Cuban violinist Omar Puente, helps her to die - and holds her hand, as she wishes - he risks 14 years in prison under the terms of the 1961 Suicide Act. He will go with her to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, and take that risk if he has to, he has said.</p> <p>Good for him. Except that the thought of her man going to jail for her is unbearable to Purdy in her distress. She wants the informal policy of turning a blind eye to such trips to be made official. </p> <p>We can all see her point of view, though some argue that her campaign may backfire by making prosecutions more likely. An average of two such cases occur each year, usually painfully sad. </p> <p>One hundred Britons have gone to die in Zurich - and needed help getting there - and no prosecutions have yet taken place. </p> <p>I'm on Purdy's side here, and have made provisional arrangements for Mrs White to tip my wheelchair over Beachy Head in an \"accident\" after first attaching a piece of string to it. (I abhor waste. She may need it herself.)</p> <p>Yet you do not have to have religious faith or subscribe to the traditional Christian view that individual life is God's gift - not something for us to destroy - to be troubled by the \"slippery slope\" argument which critics deploy against bills that would sanction assisted suicide.</p> <p>A couple of years ago I attended a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/21/politics.uk\">fringe meeting at the Lib Dem conference where Ludwig Minelli</a>, the founder of the Dignitas clinic, was the star turn. Minelli called his service a \"marvellous opportunity\" and a woman whose mother chose to die that way gave a moving account of her death.</p> <p>Yet Minelli's wish to extend the right to use his service to people suffering from manic depression struck me as a step too far. It focused attention on the core question: are patients competent to take these decisions? </p> <p>Purdy clearly is, but the same is not true for everyone. When 23-year-old rugby player <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/18/11\">Daniel James, paralysed from the chest down in a sports accident, chose to end his life</a> (not his first attempt) just 18 months after the disaster - in Switzerland in September - one wondered if the act was not premature. As they know in south Wales - the so-called <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7253788.stm\">Bridgend \"epidemic\"</a> - young people are especially vulnerable. The James family's case is being studied by the CPS.</p> <p>Yet many people, including injured soldiers, make new lives for themselves after a cruel period of readjustment. That, after all, is partly what the Paralympics are about. The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081669/Brave-Ben-Injured-Paratrooper-gives-230-000-donated-Mail-readers-charity.html\">Daily Mail reports a brilliant case today, that of paratrooper Ben Parkinson</a>. His legs shattered by an Afghan mine, and short-changed by the army, the 23-year-old has decided to give to charity the \u00a3230,000 raised by Mail readers. Wow!</p> <p>These issues have been much debated, not least in the House of Lords where Lord Joffe's bill to legalise assisted suicide has been blocked more than once. Critics say there is a rising curve of questionably motivated assisted suicides - ones where families are impatient to be rid of mum and get the will - in countries where the practice is legal.</p> <p>Labour and Lib Dem policymakers talk about it, but back off from what is guaranteed political grief about a small, largely manageable problem.</p> <p>Manageable? Newspapers routinely report that Dignitas, whose suicides are currently assisted on a grey industrial estate, is constantly on the move because neighbours don't like the regular trail of body bags so close to their homes. </p> <p>I didn't warm to Minelli, who doesn't strike me as the warm type. But surely we can do better than this? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/30/houseofcommons\">Parliament is due to sit for only 128 days next year</a> \u2013 a post-war record low, Tory MP Sir George Young protested yesterday to Gordon Brown, who sounded complacent about it.

  "<p>There are signs that in the western world (<a href=\"http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/flynn_21_1.htm\">including the US</a>) religion is, indeed, beginning a long, slow \u2013 although accelerating \u2013 decline. All the statistics show that congregations are falling, mass attendance is <a href=\"http://www.vexen.co.uk/UK/religion.html\">diminishing</a> and Christian knowledge is passing inexorably from our culture. <br> There have been two, or in some cases, three generations of people in this country who have had no connection with church at all. It plays no part in their life or their thinking. They are what I term \"the religiously indifferent\" \u2013 they couldn't care less whether religion is there or not, just so long as it doesn't interfere with their lives. Such people make up a vast and increasing swath of the population of Britain.</p> <p>Why is this? In order to survive, a religion's mythology must be imbued into the next generation at an early age, before critical faculties that might prompt resistance develop. This is Richard Dawkins' meme theory. It is also the reason that most Church of England schools are primary schools and that madrassas start the process so early on in children's lives.<br> Evangelists know that it takes only three or four generations of unchurched people for the mythology to fall from consciousness, to disappear from the culture. People find that actually they can manage perfectly well without it. Religious leaders may despair about how difficult it is to reach \"Generation Y\" (roughly, 16-25 year olds), but if children have reached adolescence and they have not been infected with the religious meme, they will be mainly immune to it. The only way is to get gentle Jesus into their heads when they're four or five. In the developing world we are told that religion is strong and, apparently, unassailable. We see people in great crowds passionately defending their beliefs from insult, or walking round a giant stone in Mecca. But one needs to ask: do they really believe what they purport to believe? Or is the religious meme so strong in poor countries that it is inescapable? Does religion control so much of the culture that it is simply not possible to function as anything other than a religious adherent, whether sincere or not? I ask this because I've noticed recently how many people are telling me: \"I'm not a religious person, but I am spiritual.\" This is rapidly followed by a defensive: \"You don't have to go to church to believe in God.\" And this is what religious leaders should fear far more than the atheism or secularism they like to rail against. The spiritual-but-not-religious brigade represents a creeping disease that can eventually kill religion. It's a way of leaving the church without having the guilt of declaring yourself an atheist. The founder of the <a href=\"http://www.secularism.org.uk\">National Secular Society</a>, Charles Bradlaugh, said: \"No man sees a religion die\". That may be so, but religions do eventually die. History is littered with their corpses. Until now they have always been replaced. But one day the human race's growing indifference to the gods will prove more lethal than any anti-clericalist dagger. Religion will die.<br> I am sorry I won't be around to see it.</p> <p><em>If you would like to comment on this week's question, please go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/oct/27/religion-atheism\">here</a></em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> My husband and I have a joint income of less than \u00a360,000 a year. He is a trainee accountant and I am an FE teacher, which also makes me a keyworker. A few months ago we applied for the government HomeBuy scheme and were offered a \u00a370,000 loan, which with our deposit of \u00a350,000 would allow us to buy a two-bedroom flat for around \u00a3300,000.</p> <p>We started looking for a suitable mortgage and home, only to receive an email saying that the funds for the government loans had run out. We now feel a little bit stuck, unsure whether we should wait for further government loans or try buying somewhere without one, though we would only be able to buy somewhere for around \u00a3240,000, which is not enough for a two-bed house in our chosen area.</p> <p>Do you know any other schemes that might give us a loan?

  "<p><strong>October 29 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiscal rules</strong></p> <p>The Tory leader, David Cameron, claimed that the government's fiscal rules were \"dead\" and Gordon Brown had no plan to tackle the economic crisis. </p> <p>He said the prime minister had been \"caught irresponsibly spinning about irresponsible spending\". </p> <p>Cameron said: \"Thousands of people are losing their homes and their jobs because your irresponsible boom has now turned to bust.\" </p> <p>But Brown insisted that his fiscal rules had been \"met\" over the last 10 years and said he was not prepared to be lectured by the opposition. </p> <p>It was right for the government to borrow to support spending during the economic downturn, he said.</p> <p>The Tories, Brown said, were not prepared for government. \"They are not even prepared for opposition.\" </p> <p><strong>Oil</strong></p> <p>Brown said it was \"important\" that oil price cuts were passed on to consumers. </p> <p>But he resisted calls for a windfall tax on energy firms' profits after BP's announcement of a \u00a36.4bn margin in the last quarter. </p> <p>The prime minister said: \"With oil prices coming down - they are now at $60 where they used to be $150 - it is important now that these price cuts in oil are passed on to all customers.\" </p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>Hundreds of new and upgraded vehicles in Afghanistan will help protect troops against the \"developing\" threats they face, Brown said. </p> <p>A \u00a3700m programme of investment would provide the \"best practical protection\" for troops fighting the Taliban and facing the threat of roadside bombs. </p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p> <p>The prime minister urged all communities in Northern Ireland to show support for troops due to parade through Belfast. </p> <p>He said he wanted to see people across the UK come out and show the military it had the \"confidence of the British people\". </p> <p>The Royal Irish Regiment is due to parade through the city centre on Sunday to mark the return of soldiers from Helmand. </p> <p><strong>Heathrow</strong></p> <p>Brown said the government was looking at \"all the environmental considerations\" relating to expansion at Heathrow airport. </p> <p>\"We said that we would look at all the environmental considerations and that is what we are doing at the moment and we will come back to the house in due course.\" </p> <p><strong>Temporary workers</strong></p> <p>The prime minister pledged that rules giving temporary workers the same rights as full-time staff would be enshrined into UK law in parliament's next session. </p> <p>He told MPs measures backed by the European parliament last week would be implemented in legislation. </p> <p><strong>Dalai Lama</strong></p> <p>Talks between China and representatives of the Dalai Lama are likely to take place shortly, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, said. </p> <p>Fresh talks would be \"hugely important\" for Tibet and would be likely to be the only way that a \"realistic possibility of progress\" could be reached. </p> <p><strong>HBOS</strong></p> <p>The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, was urged by Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat frontbencher, to publish the Office of Fair Trading report into the proposed merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>He said there were reports of new interest in parts of HBOS group, adding: \"This is a further alteration to the situation that pertained at the time that the takeover by Lloyds TSB was first mooted.\" </p> <p>The Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy, said: \"There is only one concrete offer currently on the table. That is an issue for the boards of the two banks and the shareholders involved and it is not the government. </p> <p>\"There is press speculation about other bids but there is only one firm bid on the table.\" </p> <p><strong>Scotland</strong></p> <p>Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, came under fire for his comparison of his country's economy with those of Iceland, Ireland and Norway. </p> <p>Before the current crisis he said an independent Scotland could form \"an arc of prosperity\" with other northern European countries. </p> <p>Brian Donohoe (Lab, Ayrshire Central) suggested he \"could be compared to an eight-year-old child with a bean bag\". </p> <p>But the Speaker, Michael Martin, said that Salmond was a member of the House of Commons, so \"intemperate language should not be used\". </p> <p>Murphy said: \"I am not responsible for the words of the first minister, but I am aware he has compared Scotland to Iceland, Ireland and to Norway. Iceland is now bankrupt as a country, Ireland faces an austerity budget and the Norwegian foreign minister has today told us all about Norway and told the SNP to stop making vacuous comparisons between Norway and Scotland.\" </p> <p><strong>High-speed rail</strong></p> <p>Ministers and transport officials are to examine plans for a new high-speed rail line, the transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, announced. </p> <p>The National Networks Strategy Group, chaired by Lord Adonis, the junior transport minister, will also consider extending the use of motorway hard shoulders as a method of tackling congestion and further rail electrification. </p> <p><strong>Olympics</strong></p> <p>It would be a \"gross betrayal\" of promises to the British people if the London Olympics fail to deliver a sporting legacy for the country, the shadow sports secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said. </p> <p>Britain had \"one chance\" to inspire a lifetime of sporting activity among young people and it was in danger of being wasted by the government's lack of vision. </p> <p>Andy Burnham, the sports secretary, said that the Olympics provided an opportunity \"to change permanently the place of sport in our society\". </p> <p><strong>Team GB</strong></p> <p>The name of the nation's Olympic team - Team GB - excludes a \"substantial\" part of the UK and should be changed, Kate Hoey, the Labour former sports minister, said. </p> <p>She said it was not representative of Northern Ireland and should be changed to Team UK. </p> <p><strong>Speeches</strong></p> <p>A job commanding up to a \u00a350,000 salary to write speeches for the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, came under fire from Hoey. </p> <p>She expressed incredulity over the advert, saying it had to be a \"spoof\". </p> <p><strong>Terrorism</strong></p> <p>Failure to pay compensation to Britons seriously injured in terrorist atrocities overseas is a \"national scandal\", Ian McCartney, the Labour former minister, said. </p> <p>He told MPs there was a \"patriotic case\" for establishing a fund. </p> <p>Jowell said British victims of overseas attacks ought to receive the same compensation as those injured in the UK. </p> <p>The government was working with the insurance industry to create a scheme.</p>",
  "<p>But for a young woman, ideally red hot and blonde, who's been raped, tortured and murdered, there's little crime drama likes more than a dead child. A kid's corpse immediately raises the emotional stakes of even the most humdrum drama, imbuing it with a certain compelling nature it might otherwise lack. For example, <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/primetime/criminal_minds/\">Criminal Minds</a>, which is perfectly adequate but still quite rubbish, recently featured a little girl abducted from a mall. As far as I recall, it transpired that her auntie did it, having discovered her husband was abusing the girl. Tonight's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/silentwitness/\">Silent Witness </a>begins with the death of a schoolboy whose post-mortem reveals evidence of abuse. This initiates a race-against-time hunt for another missing child and the wheeling out of that other crime drama staple inextricably linked to dead children - killer paedophiles.</p> <p>What is it about paedophiles and their activities that we find so, well, entertaining? Sinister child sex offenders feature frequently in everything from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fgczH_PEL8\">CSI </a>through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/16/broadcasting.tvandradio\">Prime Suspect</a> to <a href=\"http://www.thebill.com/page.asp?partid=1\">The Bill</a>. And Special Victims' Unit is, of course, all about sex offences, many of them perpetrated against youngsters. (<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=1OlCVNn9ZeY\">Doink doink!</a>) </p> <p>But what is the fascination with paedophilia? Is it that these \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUXGyazvQzk\">especially heinous</a>\" crimes are so beyond our ken that we watch to gain insight? Is it, as is the case with most detective dramas, that there's comfort in watching a disruption to the social order - particularly a disruption so appalling as the rape/murder/torture of a child - being rectified by the forces of good? Do we find solace in fictional restorations because neat closure is impossible in real life? </p> <p>Or is it something darker that appeals about these dramas? As I might have mentioned, I watch a lot of Special Victims' Unit but I wonder what it is I especially like about it as opposed to, say, Criminal Intent or the original Law &amp; Order. Is it a tabloid prurience that makes me want to watch stories of abuse and murder? Do we derive a thrill, not from the restoration of order - which sometimes isn't forthcoming in these dramas - but from its initial disruption? Do we watch to see the perps brought to justice or just to watch the perps?</p>",

They alone, on the wall in the shadows at the back of the room, shine brightly. But their double portrait is not a painting; it is a mirror in which the royal couple are reflected as faithfully as doubtless they will be in the portrait the royal painter is working on. Diego Vel\u00e1zquez stands back from his tall canvas, whose painted side we cannot see, to look at the king and queen. The pretty little Infanta stands looking at her parents. A lady in waiting curtsies; a dwarf gazes seriously. At the back of the room, a door has opened and a minister looks in, sombrely. Bad news?</p> <p>This is Vel\u00e1zquez's greatest work, Las Meninas, a dazzling allegory of the nature of art. He painted it at the end of a triumphant life. In his youth in Seville, he specialised in street people. His tremendous Water Seller is a study in human dignity with no honours or regalia of any kind: just the strength to endure poverty and isolation. Vel\u00e1zquez could paint, naturally, like Caravaggio.</p> <p>Even after his early Seville scenes got him a job as a court painter, his first instinct was to paint robustly and demotically - in his picture The Drunkards a bunch of rustic boozers pose with the wine god Bacchus as if having their photograph taken with a celebrity. It's a painting whose ironic comedy and pathos have a lot in common with Cervantes's novel Don Quixote.</p> <p>But Vel\u00e1zquez was too ambitious, brilliant and uneasy to stand still. He abandoned this style after looking at paintings by Titian and Rubens in the Spanish royal collection and travelling to Rome. His art absorbs the lessons of Titian's sumptuous courtly style, and he perfects a heightened, glamorous, scintillating painterly way with the sheen of silk, the creaminess of velvet, the ruffled flicker of lace. And yet, his perfecting of this high style does not tame his art. Far from it.</p> <p>The Rokeby Venus is as sumptuous a demonstration of painterly style as anyone could wish for - the pale glowing flesh of the woman lying with her back to us is displayed, dramatically, on grey silk. But even as Vel\u00e1zquez invites the eye to contemplate her as if she were an expensive sculpture, we<br>catch sight of this woman's face in the mirror she's studying - and it is a real, imperfect face, serious, meditative. The blurred reflection makes the scene's luxury discontinuous, uneasy.</p> <p>And in all Vel\u00e1zquez's great paintings there is the same grave questioning of things. Are the dwarfs he portrays supposed to be lesser mortals, comic figures? They have a sceptical toughness that make them the equal of kings and courtiers. In his battle scene The Surrender at Breda, generals meet courteously in the foreground - and a town burns in the distance. His portrait of Aesop depicts a man regarding us sceptically out of ancient, worn, unfooled eyes.</p> <p>This training in sophisticated style and preservation of ironic detachment is all leading somewhere - to Las Meninas. In his only self-image, Vel\u00e1zquez here portrays himself in the act of making a painting - he sees himself through the eyes of the king and queen, just as they see themselves through his eyes. Reflections on reflections. Art is a mirror, but what it mirrors is a system of illusions. Life, as a Spanish dramatist of the age put it, is a dream. <strong>(Jonathan Jones)</strong></p> <h2>Jan Vermeer - The Kitchen Maid (c1658), View of Houses in Delft: The Little Street (c1658), A Lady Writing (c1660), View of Delft (c1661), Woman Reading a Letter (c1662-1663), Girl with a Pearl Earring (c1665), Girl with a Red Hat (c1665-1666), The Art of Painting (c1665-1666)</h2> <p>Just look at the artistic epiphany of that brick wall. The sparkle as light catches that earthenware jug. The gloss of spit on the lips. That pearl earring. Forget the genre scenes and the allegories of this and that \u2014 Vermeer's paintings are a miracle of love at first seeing.</p> <p>You catch sight of those bricks in The Little Street and they look as if they were painted today. They're that fresh. The marvel of this painting is not down to meanings. Or if meaning comes into it, it's more in the way that you might say a loved one means so much to you. Similarly, there's the stippling on the bread and the vertical dribble of milk from the jug in The Kitchen Maid, the downy scarlet blush of the hat emerging so seductively from the background shade of Girl with Red Hat. Here are intense perceptual insights embodied in the most sensitive of painterly touches.</p> <p>Then there's Vermeer's remarkable compositions. The geometry of the headscarf acting as a pivot for the utterly compelling sideways glance of Girl with a Pearl Earring, the earring itself acting as exquisite counterweight. The pregnancy of Woman Reading a Letter is peaked by a downward gaze that stops exactly on the insubstantial scrap of paper that obviously bodes so much.</p> <p>I wouldn't know how to begin to unravel the compositional tensions in The Art of Painting, and I'm not sure I want to. The baroque filigree of the chandelier, the muting weight of the parted curtain, that black-and-white chequered floor, the first tentative touches of paint on the otherwise blank canvas: it's all hypnotising.<strong> (Robert Clark)</strong></p> <h2>Veronese - Feast in the House of Levi (1573)</h2> <p>The Inquisition had some tough questions to ask this great Venetian master about his version of the Last Supper in which partying nobles cavort around the central, almost dwarfed scene of Christ prophesying his betrayal and demise; there's a materialist love of people and stuff in Veronese that does indeed seem irreligious. He stood up to his interrogators and contemptuously sidestepped their accusations by simply renaming the picture as the less sensitive story of Christ attending the Feast in the House of Levi. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Vietnamese (8th century) - Female figure from Huong Qua</h2> <p>The Champa dynasty was famed for its fantastical sculptures of gods, dancing celestials and gruesome beasts that were usually carved in sandstone.

Battling against human opponents, territories are fought over in day-long encounters, with your performance affecting the following day's front line. EndWar's intuitive system works well, aside from the occasional voice recognition blip, and its fast-paced, action-fuelled gameplay will bring a new form of RTS to the console-loving masses.</p>",
  "<p>I am writing this on Windows 7, the successor to Vista that was previewed at Microsoft's Professional Developer's Conference in Los Angeles earlier this week. Microsoft is keen to avoid a repetition of Vista's shambolic launch. Mike Nash, corporate vice-president, spoke at the press briefing about learning from the Vista experience, and the man in charge of Windows engineering, Steven Sinofsky, emphasised the rigour and discipline of the Windows 7 development process. </p> <p>It appears to be working. Even in the preview handed out to the press, Windows 7 feels more polished and less annoying than its predecessor. The changes are not dramatic, but that is a good thing. Microsoft has left the core architecture untouched, so that software and devices that worked on Vista should still work. </p> <p>Microsoft is also making Windows \"quieter\"; in other words, reducing the number of prompts that interrupt your work. For example, too many applications now install themselves in the Windows system tray and pop up frequent notifications. Windows 7 lets you hide them or turn off their messages, returning control to the user. You can also fine-tune User Account Control, the security feature which in Vista flashes the screen and shows a dialog whenever you change a system setting. </p> <p>Windows 7 does have some user interface changes, the most obvious being a revised taskbar, which shows an icon for every running application. The Windows 7 taskbar has larger icons, full-screen application previews when you hover the mouse, and \"jump lists\": pop-up menus that control key features, such as starting or stopping a song in Windows Media Player, or visiting a favourite site in Internet Explorer. Application windows can be made transparent to see files on the desktop, and when you drag a window with the mouse, it snaps to screen borders: a small touch but one that feels natural. </p> <p>Windows Explorer, the main tool for file management, has a new feature called libraries, which pulls together content from multiple locations and lets you treat them as one. For example, if you have some photos on an internal hard drive and others on an external drive, you can include both locations in one library and search it like a single folder. Applets like WordPad and Paint have been refreshed, and now sport fat ribbon toolbars like those introduced in Office 2007.</p> <p>However, it will not be the new features that make or break Windows 7, but rather its quality, compatibility and performance. Windows 7 is less ambitious than Vista, its development is less rushed, and provided Microsoft can dissuade its partners from overlaying it with third-party add-ons of lesser quality, this release promises to be one users will actually enjoy.</p>",
  "<p>The smartphone landscape is changing rapidly with the arrival of the T-Mobile G1, the first phone based on Google's Android software, and the huge success of Apple's iPhone business. And if both of these take big slices of the smartphone market, that leaves less for everybody else \u2013 unless they can find a way to respond.</p> <p>Research In Motion (RIM) is already in motion: it has spent the past couple of years moving into the consumer market with hot new products such as the BlackBerry Bold and Storm. Nokia, the world's largest phonemaker, has targeted high-end users with the E71, N95 and N96 and similar phones. Nokia has also taken control of the Symbian smartphone operating system and is making that open source as well. Meanwhile, Microsoft has ... done not very much at all. </p> <p>\"We're very confident in our strategy, so I don't think we need a particular response,\" says Alex Reeve, who heads up the Windows Mobile business in the UK. </p> <p>But while Microsoft sold 18m smartphone licences in the year to June, 2m short of its target, Apple says it sold 6.9m iPhones during the last quarter alone. As the iPhone goes global, it's not hard to see it outselling Microsoft's 50+ handset manufacturers combined. It's also not hard to see many of those 50+ handset manufacturers at least trying Android as well.</p> <p>Microsoft is in a tricky position because, like Google, it doesn't make phones. It supplies an operating system that anyone can license, but ultimately it's reliant on partners who may have other ideas. </p> <p>Taiwan's HTC, for example, has been a major manufacturer of Windows Mobile phones, but now it's making G1 Googlephones as well. </p> <p>Windows Mobile can't even rely on its parent, Microsoft to give it a market advantage. Phones running Windows Mobile were the first to offer good synchronisation with Microsoft Exchange, which is the standard corporate email server, and this gave Windows Mobile an advantage in the business market. However, Microsoft has since licensed Exchange sync to rival handset-makers including Palm, Nokia and Apple. </p> <p><strong>Locked market</strong></p> <p>Reeve says: \"We've taken the approach that we want as many people to have access to Exchange as possible. We have absolute confidence in our ability to sell our mobile product without locking people in.\"</p> <p>Of course, Microsoft still has advantages for corporate use. Ken Dulaney at Gartner, the leading analyst covering handhelds and smartphones, points out that all the systems that were designed for warehouse and factory floor use run Windows Mobile. Also, companies can develop their own applications using Microsoft Visual Studio \u2013 which they already use to develop PC applications \u2013 and install those applications however they like. </p> <p>\"We'd never lock people in like the iPhone,\" says Reeve. \"The whole point of a smartphone, in the Microsoft philosophy, is to make it open to applications, so everybody can build the solutions they really want.\"</p> <p>Google's Android software is open-source (it's based on Linux) and free, so it could also challenge Microsoft as an open application platform. But Reeve doesn't think the G1 is a threat. \"It has no integration at all with the enterprise,\" he says, and Google has a \"kill switch\" so it can erase software that you load on the device.</p> <p>According to Dulaney, Microsoft had a choice with Windows Mobile 6: it could either \"defend their enterprise turf against RIM\", or focus on improving the user interface and attack the consumer market where the iPhone was making headway. \"In either case, they were going to suffer,\" says Dulaney. </p> <p>\"I think they chose the right thing, which was to defend the enterprise area, where they're strong,\" he says.</p> <p>Reeve, however, rejects the idea that Microsoft has been slipping in the consumer market. \"We're growing very quickly in that area,\" he says. </p> <p>He points to the HTC Diamond, HTC Touch HD, Samsung Omnia and the Xperia X1 \u2013 Sony Ericsson's first Windows Mobile phone \u2013 as being stylish designs with consumer appeal. A hit product can change everything, at least for a while.</p> <p>Stylish hardware does not necessarily come with stylish software, of course, and Windows Mobile has come in for plenty of criticism. Dulaney says Microsoft has \"different priorities \u2013 a passion for developers\", but lacks Apple's passion for the user interface (UI). \"They just don't have the genes,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>Face to face</strong></p> <p>The hardware suppliers and network operators can do something about that by changing the UI, as Palm has done, or by adding their own interface, as HTC did with TouchFLO. So far, however, nothing has come close to the iPhone. </p> <p>Whether Microsoft will be able to do that with Windows Mobile 7 remains to be seen: Reeve says Microsoft isn't commenting.</p> <p>But in the long run, the real question is whether Microsoft cares. If Windows Mobile sells 20m licences a year at a hypothetical $7 to $8 (\u00a34.50 to \u00a35) each, that's only $140m to $160m, which isn't as much as a decent Xbox 360 game. It's a very long way from the $4.6bn that Apple reckons the iPhone generated in the last quarter alone. </p> <p>Still, Microsoft isn't likely to drop out of the mobile phone market, for two reasons. First, there's value in the way Windows Mobile fits into Microsoft's whole enterprise business, supporting Microsoft Office, Exchange and its Live web sites. Second, Windows Mobile isn't a standalone system, it's just one example of a software stack based on Windows CE, alongside PocketPC and Windows Automotive. CE has been used in thousands of products including set-top boxes, petrol pumps, jukeboxes and even sewing machines. </p> <p>Given the scale of the investment in Windows CE, and Microsoft's ambitions in the consumer electronics area, Microsoft must surely keep it going.</p> <p>What I think we are likely to see, under the Windows not Walls slogan, is Microsoft moving to a broader \"platform play\". Instead of focusing on particular products, Microsoft could present Windows as a more interoperable offering for the 2010s. </p> <p>The platform will have three legs - Windows 7, Windows Mobile 7 and Windows Live - with Live Mesh rings automatically synchronising data as required across all your devices. (If you want to play with Live Mesh, <a href=\"https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx\">sign up for the beta</a>.) </p> <p>Applications such as email, messaging and word processing will be available on all devices, and also online at Windows Live, with the two working together. You can take your pick about which you prefer at any given time, because they'll interoperate.</p> <p><strong>In the ring</strong></p> <p>It sounds like a good plan \u2013 but then, so did the Windows CE strategy in the early 1990s. However, even the best plans can fail if the execution isn't up to scratch, and sometimes things just don't work out the way anyone might expect.</p> <p>For example, starting in the late 1990s, Microsoft has spent the thick end of a decade establishing its own mobile platform. It can't have imagined being overtaken by a late entrant such as Apple's iPhone. It surely couldn't have imagined being challenged by a phone from a search engine company, Google, that barely existed at the time.</p> <p>Bill Gates met similar challenges in 1995 when he made Microsoft do a U-turn on the internet, performed with unexpected agility and speed. Whether Steve Ballmer can do it remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>An early build of Windows 7 is now in the hands of thousands of software developers, who got the code at this week's Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles. Major hardware manufacturers already have copies, but many more will get them at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/WinHEC/default.mspx\">WinHEC</a>, the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, which opens in Los Angeles in November 5.</p> <p>Microsoft is providing tons of information, so I hope they're paying attention. Windows, uniquely, has to work on PCs from more than 10,000 companies, and run well over 1m applications for roughly a billion users. It has to handle everything from tiny handhelds to the large rack-based servers that run major corporations. Indeed, you can build you own PC and expect Windows to work on it.</p> <p>It's no secret that too few suppliers paid attention to the last version, Windows Vista, which therefore got off to a bad start. Badly written software either didn't work correctly or kept bringing up pointless alerts from Vista's UAC (User Account Control) security feature. Some components and peripherals either had no drivers, or worse, had really bad drivers. Some PC manufacturers were slugging Vista systems with old crapware written for XP. Many other problems came from Microsoft's failure to deliver what had been expected \u2013 and when.</p> <p>It took the best part of a year (and a lot of investment) to solve these problems, so that today, Vista SP1 is far better than the original \u2013 and far better than its reputation. To give just one example, the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/08/user-account-control.aspx\">Windows Engineering blog</a> points out that the number of applications and tasks that generate a UAC prompt fell from 775,312 at launch to 168,149 in August 2008, and the number is still falling.</p> <p>Of course, changing Windows isn't like remodelling a boutique, it's more like redesigning a city. It involves moving well over 90% of the whole microcomputer industry, some of which is highly resistant to change. It takes time.</p> <p>The good news about Windows 7 is that it maintains compatibility with Vista device drivers and software, according to John Curran, who heads the Windows Client Group at Microsoft UK. It will therefore benefit from Vista's problems in the same way that XP benefited from Windows 2000's.</p> <p>What else it contains remains to be seen, because Microsoft has changed the way Windows 7 is built. With Vista, features were pretty much added through a \"top down\" process, which was uneven at best. With Windows 7, development is <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/10/15/engineering-7-a-view-from-the-bottom.aspx\">\"bottom up\"</a>, and teams are not allowed to add their feature to the main build until it has been both coded and tested. You may end up with fewer features, but the quality should be consistently higher. </p> <p>Since builds are not \"feature complete\", it's hard to say what Windows 7 will include. We know that it will have a much improved UAC and better management of drivers and devices. We know it will have multi-touch features and gesture recognition. We know some parts will have ribbon interfaces: Windows is now being run by Steve Sinofsky, who was ultimately responsible for the ribbons in the hugely successful Office 2007.</p> <p>Either way, it should do well. It doesn't matter if it's not a big upgrade on Vista, because 64-bit Windows 7 is a very big upgrade for the 80% of the market that is still using 32-bit Windows XP.</p>",
  "<p>Ellie Scrivens, who has died aged 54 of a brain tumour, was professor of health policy at Keele University from 1993 until illness forced her retirement last summer. She contributed to both the understanding and practice of regulation in healthcare, in particular the quality of care. Her work was based on an encyclopedic knowledge of the \"state of play\" in systems for quality assurance across the world, and she was close to the heart of policymaking in England, Scotland and France, with connections in Australia and the US. Her advisory role also extended to the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Ellie's work was often well ahead of its time. The real nature of regulation, for example, was elucidated ingeniously in her work. Health policy in the UK now emphasises external regulation rather than internal accountability for performance, and current moves in England towards official accreditation of health providers reflect arguments that Ellie had been making more than 10 years ago. </p> <p>She was born in Solihull, West Midlands, and went to Malvern Hall school there. Her ancestors were Dutch but had stalled in Wales on their way to America. Her father was a chartered accountant who inherited a chain of newsagents in the southern suburbs of Birmingham. These two factors accounted for her aversion to mountains (or even small hills) and her propensity for buying chocolate bars by the boxload.</p> <p>She was educated at Exeter University and the London School of Economics, where she took a PhD in social policy. This examined attitudes to cash grants with which individuals might buy their own social care; the debate about direct payments continues today. In 1979, she was appointed lecturer in social administration and health services research at London University, then from 1985 was lecturer in public sector management at the London Business School, and from 1991 was researcher, then senior researcher, in the health services development research unit at Bath University. She joined the centre for health planning and management at Keele as professor of health policy in 1993. </p> <p>Ellie's research training had been first-class, and she was one of a small minority of social scientists at the time who could handle statistics (and computers). Later she found a form of policy analysis that was not only her own, but highly productive. She was a skilled and generous networker, but her scholarship was based on painstaking analysis, validation and synthesis, and often resulted in typologies that were both academically rigorous and useful for policy. </p> <p>Her first book, Accreditation (1995), distilled insights from health service schemes overseas and asked whether accreditation protected the consumer. The theme of the service user, and whether consumerism or state control could better assure quality, was again central to her Quality, Risk and Control in Healthcare (2005). Who should set standards, and who should police them? Both of these books won the Baxter prize of the European Health Management Association.</p> <p>In 1999 Ellie was commissioned to establish the NHS controls assurance support unit at Keele. Boards of all NHS organisations were required to sign off an explicit statement assuring control in a wide range of areas, for which the chief executive was the accountable officer. In 2004, when controls were replaced by wider standards, the unit became the healthcare standards unit. Ellie and her staff became expert in the definition of usable standards. Sitting between the department of health and the NHS, she brought realism as well as conceptual challenge and clarity to the development of standards as a regulatory tool of government. </p> <p>Politically astute, Ellie noted wryly that she and her unit had outlived most of the NHS organisations she had worked with and for. She had a fuller grasp of the cyclical nature of policy systems than the civil servants who called her seeking advice. She was amused, as she worked on what was to be her final report from the unit, that the policy wheel had turned full circle and she was, again, advising on systems of organisational accreditation. </p> <p>Her next book would have been an account of regulatory policy tools, but also of how policy actually emerges from government and the civil service. Her understanding of the importance of productive relationships between regulators and the regulated was based on her own involvement in local health services. She served continuously as a non-executive member on boards ranging from London health authorities in the 1980s, when she also served on the national board of Age Concern, to health authority, strategic health authority and primary care trust boards after her move to Staffordshire. </p> <p>Ellie was a caring and generous colleague with an original mind, great energy and courage, and a gentle and sparky sense of humour. She took great pride in her family - her son and daughter Kester and Justine, and David, her long-term partner whom she married in the summer - all of whom survive her. </p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth Julia Scrivens, health policy researcher, born September 20 1954; died October 19 2008</p>",
  "<p>A wave of synchronised suicide attacks on UN, diplomatic and government institutions in northern Somalia killed up to 31 people yesterday. </p> <p>Three car bombs detonated in Hargeisa, the capital of the breakaway Somaliland region. Another two vehicles exploded in neighbouring Puntland which, like Somaliland, has been relatively peaceful compared to the rest of the country.</p> <p>The careful coordination and nature of the attacks is unprecedented in Somalia, and marks a serious deterioration in an already dire security situation. Suspicion immediately fell on the radical Shabaab militia, which is part of much broader Islamist-led resistance fighting against the Somali government and occupying Ethiopian troops. </p> <p>In Hargeisa, the Ethiopian consulate suffered the greatest damage, with up to 20 people reported dead. An attack on the president's palace killed at least three people, including the presidential secretary, while two workers died at the headquarters of the UN development programme.</p> <p>\"A vehicle forced its way into the compound and then exploded,\" said a UNPD spokesperson in Nairobi. \"It appears that the driver of the car was still inside.\"</p> <p>The suicide bombers, who were reported to have used four-wheel drive vehicles, struck within a few minutes of each other. </p> <p>In Bossaso, Puntland's main city, explosive-laden cars detonated at separate interior ministry offices responsible for combating terrorism, killing six people. Dozens were injured in the five attacks. </p> <p>\"I fear that this is exactly what it looks like - the Shabaab,\" said a military expert on Somalia, who cannot be named because of his position. \"We expected them to launch high-profile attacks, but this was extraordinary, requiring a large coordinated and concealed effort.\"</p> <p>Analysts believe the timing of the bombings was no accident. Regional heads of state, including Somalia's president, Abdullahi Yusuf, were meeting yesterday in Nairobi to discuss the country's future. Peace efforts had received a boost over the weekend when Yusuf's government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) signed a deal in Djibouti agreeing to a ceasefire, and a phased withdrawal of Ethiopian troops.</p> <p>But a breakaway wing of the ARS, as well as the Shabaab, rejected the deal. They refuse to enter negotiations before the complete withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces that invaded Somalia in December 2006 to oust an Islamist authority from power. </p> <p>Previously during peace negotiations the Shabaab has launched large attacks, mainly in Mogadishu, to demonstrate that they have control on the ground. </p> <p>\"It's clear that the Shabaab, or jihadis or whatever you want to call them, are trying to make a statement that they target any place in Somalia, not just the south,\" said a western diplomat in Nairobi. \"But we cannot let this undermine the Djibouti agreement, and we have to accept that these sort of attacks may continue in the short term.\" </p> <p>Previously there have only been one or two small suicide attacks in Somalia.</p>",
  "<p>Vodafone is understood to have clinched a strategic partnership with Mobile TeleSystems, the largest mobile phone operator in Russia, as it searches for growth in emerging markets.</p> <p>The deal, which Moscow-based MTS is expected to announce this morning, will see Vodafone sign up MTS as a \"partner network\" to bring a range of Vodafone services into Russia and other countries including Ukraine and Belarus.</p> <p>MTS and its subsidiaries have more than 87 million customers in Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, out of a total population of more than 230 million.</p> <p>MTS has been listed in New York for the past eight years and is majority-owned by billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov's Sistema conglomerate. Vodafone is not expected to take an equity stake in the firm. Neither Vodafone nor MTS would comment on the move.</p> <p>The deal will provide reassurance for western companies who have become concerned about doing business in Russia after the political interference that forced BP into a major restructuring of its BP-TNK joint venture and the Kremlin's incursion into Georgia.</p> <p>In July, Vodafone admitted that some of its core markets such as Spain and the UK were becoming challenging because of the worsening economic climate. The company will announce its half-year results on November 11 and the management is expected to deliver a gloomy prognosis for Vodafone's core European businesses and to announce another round of cost cuts.</p> <p>To try to make up the slack, the company recently restructured its management to focus on emerging markets. It has already made acquisitions in India, Turkey and Ghana and recently strengthened its position in South Africa by acquiring control of the country's largest cellular phone operator, Vodacom. </p> <p>Yesterday, Vodafone announced plans to increase its stake in Poland's telecoms operator Polkomtel by 4.8% to 24.4%, for \u20ac176m (\u00a3140m).</p> <p>It has also made extensive use of partnerships. It has more than 40 network partners across the world and has used them to expand eastwards in Europe. It has partner networks in Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Under the terms of these agreements, Vodafone and its partners cooperate in the development of global services under dual brand logos. Services in Russia are expected to be marketed under the MTS-Vodafone logo.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome, my friends, to the New Optimism: stockmarkets surging, VW shares up 400%, ivory markets booming, and it's even snowing. It hasn't snowed in south-east England in October since the mid-70s! Could this be a sign heralding an unprecedented Winter of Content? Is it too early to pretend we've turned the corner?</p> <p>In terms of uplifting animal news, there has rarely been a tale as heartwarming as that of Carla the angelfish, who lived happily at the London Aquarium for 10 years before developing a life-threatening hernia, which had recently begun to squeeze her organs right out of her. But after a \u00a3500, 30-minute operation performed by vet Sue Thornton, Carla's organs are back inside and she's reportedly doing fine. In more ruthless times it might have been hard to justify taking a fish out of water and putting it under the knife unless you were planning to gut it, but there's no doubt that when market confidence takes a knock, a little sentimentality goes a long way. Yes, there may yet come a time when we have to eat all the fish in the London Aquarium, but Carla's story shows us that we're not there yet. </p> <p>It is quite possible that from here on in things can only get better but, at this delicate stage, negative thinking is more dangerous then negative equity.

  "<p>So Jonathan Ross (I'm worth 1,000 BBC journalists) is suspended and Russell Brand has resigned. MPs condemn them in the Commons: \"base\", \"vulgar\", \"puerile\", \"predictable\", they say - while on these pages Jack Straw, the justice secretary, joins in, labelling the pair \"so-called stars\". And the reaction from the BBC's cash-strapped newsroom is instantaneous. \"It's the most entertainment we have had from them all year,\" a staffer tells us. So the effort wasn't wasted.</p> <p>\u2022 Straw has also been plagued by bleeding hearts among the criminal justice lobby using impenetrable language. Last week he complained that phrases such as the \"criminogenic needs of offenders\" send him \"nuts\", and one must guess that the madness started in 1998, when he himself hailed Home Office research \"designed to assess the specific criminogenic factors associated with offending by women.\" If the justice secretary can move on from that sort of language, why can't everyone else?</p> <p>\u2022 Further and better reaches us about events at Yarl's Wood detention centre, where staff found that asylum seekers deprived of a pamphlet explaining how to construct appeals were, as a direct result, less able to mount those appeals. Yarl's Wood we know; but it's still not right. Last week we reported that officials were made to hand the pamphlets back following complaints to the UK Border Agency, and now we have an update. Of the two women so deprived, one has since been released; the other's deportation has been postponed. And it is the latter case we turn to again today, for it transpires that officials were seeking to send her back to Kenya, even though she was on suicide watch - having already made one attempt to take her life in Yarl's Wood. When London MEP Jean Lambert made representations on her behalf to the Border Agency, it was forced to admit it did not know the detainee had tried to kill herself with an overdose. Yarl's Wood simply had not told the agency. Ministers promise a system that is fast and fair, but it is obviously a work in progress. One out of two is not bad. </p> <p>\u2022 After many weeks in the eye of the storm, it should have been comforting for the National Black Police Association to escape to the sanctuary of its annual conference in York. Criticism has been unremitting since the NBPA said it would discourage black recruits. No surprise they sought to take stock among friends. And that might have been the case had they invited, as they intended, the robust but undeniably sophisticated David Davis MP, former shadow home secretary. Alas, the speaking invite went to his scratchier Tory colleague, David Davies, MP for Monmouth - who, once there, lambasted the NBPA for being racist. What to do? Davis; Davies. They all look the same. </p> <p>\u2022 But then they grow accustomed to the scandals and the subsequent apologies. Whoops, there goes another one. This time in Northern Ireland. \"There were no overweight people in Auschwitz,\" said Angie Best - former wife of George - during a BBC TV discussion about obesity. \"It was a slip of the tongue,\" says Angie, now chastened. At least her idiocy was live.</p> <p>\u2022 So did you hear the one where Gordon had to introduce Nelson to Amy Winehouse because the old boy had never heard of the hapless songstress? How, required to sing Free Nelson Mandela, she actually sang \"Blakey My Fella\". Many thousands will have heard it by now because the tale has become the stock joke for occasions addressed by the prime minister. He told it to the TUC in Brighton last month, and at the Foreign Office on October 8 at a ceremony for Britain's 100 most influential black people; he told it again in Downing Street on October 20, at a reception for activists involved in the anti-knife/gun campaign, the Peace Alliance; and yesterday we learned that at a recent lunch attended by the actor Julian Rhind-Tutt, he gave it another airing. The PM has learned, we are told, that he is best when he is bold; and with that in mind, might this not be a good time for us - and that means all of us - to find a new joke for Gordon.

  "<p>Cristiano Ronaldo began another hugely satisfying evening's work by collecting the Golden Boot for his 42 goals last season and, after another fine demonstration of the art of scoring, it ended with his name being sung with more vigour than any other time since his summer dalliance with Real Madrid. There will always be some Manchester United supporters who struggle to forgive and forget but for as long as Ronaldo can strike this kind of fear in opposition defences he will inevitably succeed in winning over the majority.</p> <p>Another two goals were served up here and if the Portuguese had not aimed his shot too close to Robert Green in the 89th minute Europe's most prolific scorer would have added another souvenir match ball to his collection. As it was, his goals had already settled the game on a night that will otherwise be remembered for West Ham's feeble resistance and the sheer brilliance with which Dimitar Berbatov, an Old Trafford hero in the making, set up the second goal.</p> <p>The biggest compliment that can be paid to Berbatov is that, even in a stadium with the rich nostalgia and sepia-tinted memories of Old Trafford, it was difficult to remember a more sublime piece of penalty-area skill - even from Ronaldo. Sir Alex Ferguson used such adjectives as \"stunning\" and \"magnificent\" and nobody at Old Trafford will ever tire of seeing the television replays of how Berbatov deceived his marker, James Collins, to leave Ronaldo with an open goal.</p> <p>Yet Ferguson was not altogether happy. Two up after half an hour, a thrashing might easily have materialised but, to the manager's irritation, his team eased off in the second half, despite playing the last 21 minutes with Ronaldo, Berbatov, Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney - a substitute - all on the pitch.</p> <p>\"The first half was magnificent and after that I was looking forward to more of the same,\" said Ferguson. \"I was hoping they could add to their goals tally because that could be important at the end of the season. But they took their foot off the pedal and played at a couple of gears below what they are capable of. They ended up too lax for me.\"</p> <p>The reason for that, perhaps, was that West Ham were so feeble that the players in red became bored with their own superiority. Ronaldo's first goal, for example, came in the midst of one of those extended spells when every West Ham player must have been enveloped by a deep sense of foreboding. Nani played the ball across the penalty area and Ronaldo was on to it in a flash, lashing a left-foot shot into the corner of Green's net. How would he celebrate? Old Trafford's amateur psychologists waited to analyse his body language and, after a dramatic pause of which Robert de Niro would have been proud, there was an explosion of unrestrained joy. Point made.</p> <p>That was in the 14th minute and, from that moment onwards, Gianfranco Zola must have been hoping the final whistle could somehow be brought forward. The Italian won his first two league games after taking over from Alan Curbishley as manager but since then West Ham's form has plummeted. They also lost Valon Behrami to a potentially serious injury and their fourth consecutive defeat was all but confirmed when Berbatov's brilliance set up Ronaldo again.</p> <p>The Bulgarian had done well even to keep Anderson's through-ball in play, reaching it only a few inches before it went out for a goal kick, but it was what came next which took the breath away. In one sublime movement Berbatov spun, pirouetted and danced away from Collins. The defender was still coming to his senses as Berbatov advanced towards goal and slid a beautifully weighted pass across the six-yard area. Ronaldo, alert as always, got there first, leaving Ferguson to eulogise about his \u00a330.5m new signing.</p> <p>\"I'm going to have to see it again to understand how he [Berbatov] did it,\" the United manager said. \"You'd pay double the money to watch that - fantastic imagination, control and balance.\"</p> <p>Ferguson had made five changes from the team that drew 1-1 against Everton on Saturday, with Edwin van der Sar given the night off on his 38th birthday. His replacement, Tomasz Kuszczak, can be a danger to his own team sometimes but it was a measure of West Ham's performance that they did not force the Pole into a save until the final few minutes. This was as one-sided as they come.</p>",
  "<p>Gene Upshaw was not only a Hall of Fame American football player, but arguably that country's most successful trade union leader of the last quarter of a century. The skills that made him a great lineman in the National Football League (NFL) - the strength to move an opponent in the direction he wanted, the flexibility to chase down a blocking target, and the tenacity to hold his ground protecting his quarterback - served him in his second career as executive director of the NFL's players' association. </p> <p>Upshaw, who has died aged 63 at his home in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, only days after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, took over leadership of the union in 1983 at a time of crisis. He brought his members to new heights of reward and contractual freedom, while cooperating with the league to maintain its competitive balance. In the modern era of salary caps and free agency, the NFL model serves as an example for sports worldwide, not least English football.</p> <p>NFL players receive 60% of the league's gross revenues within a salary cap of $116m between each team's 53-man roster. Although contracts are not guaranteed, players collect bonus money up front, in effect replacing lost salary if the team releases them. But the team owners announced recently that they would opt out of the current deal, which expires in 2010, and Upshaw was also under pressure from his members, some of whom wanted guaranteed contracts like the other major American sports, or a more aggressive stance against the cap. They felt he was not doing enough for former players who had fallen on hard times.</p> <p>Upshaw was born in Robstown, Texas. High school was disrupted because he picked cotton to assist the family finances, and he played only one year of high school football. But during his studies at the traditionally black Texas College of Arts and Industries, the Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis overruled his scouts and chose Upshaw with his first pick in the college draft, installing him at left guard. Upshaw was named to all-star teams 11 times in his 15-year career and played in three Super Bowls across three decades, winning twice, in 1976 and 1980. He was a leader on and off the field, becoming his team's union representative, then a member of the player association's executive board. After retiring in 1981, he became its president.</p> <p>The following year the executive director of the players' association, Ed Garvey, demanded 55% of gross revenues in salaries. The owners' attitude was personified by Hugh Culverhouse, of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who growled: \"Don't give that damn communist a thing.\" Ironically, the owners owed their success to being forced by the then commissioner Pete Rozelle to share all national television revenue equally. Union members, already divided by the terms of a proposed deal, were further split by Garvey's strike call. Upshaw stood by Garvey but the strike cost them two months of the 1982 season, and Garvey was subsequently replaced by Upshaw. He was helped by having won the right for players to see all contracts. When they discovered what their team-mates were earning, Upshaw's calls for greater unity were heeded.</p> <p>When the deal expired in 1987, the owners were better prepared. The Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm told Upshaw: \"You guys are the cattle and we're the ranchers. We can always get more cattle.\" When the players went on strike again, the owners assembled scab teams of replacement players to stage an ersatz season. The issue led to legal action under anti-trust legislation, and although a deal was struck in 1989, it took four more years for the details to be hammered out.</p> <p>I met Upshaw, a strong supporter of NFL Europe, a number of times. He once explained that the owners failed to realise that the salary cap protected them, not from the players, but from themselves, since rich teams would always pay over the odds, and small teams would have to match their scale. He was proved right.</p> <p>Although the case of ex-players fallen on hard times was given much publicity, Upshaw had quietly helped many on a personal basis, including some who criticised him, but claimed his first duty was to get his current members what they wanted. When his fellow Hall of Fame guard Joe DeLamielleure mocked him, he replied: \"I'd like to break his neck.\" As a player, Upshaw had been known for wrapping his fists in tape until they resembled clubs. But as his successor Paul Tagliabue pointed out: \"If you hit him on the head, he could strike back twice as hard, but he didn't always... He never lost sight of the big picture.\"</p> <p>Upshaw is survived by his wife, Terri, and three sons.</p> <p>\u2022 Eugene Thurman Upshaw, American football player and trade unionist, born August 15 1945; died August 20 2008</p>",
  "<p>In Warsaw, Missouri, there's a ghost who keeps talking to me through the mouths of strangers. He is the ghost of slavery past, and he casts a long shadow, even across the streets of this cheerful little lakeside town on a sunny autumn day. A local Obama campaign volunteer tells me about a woman she had canvassed who said she personally would vote for Barack but that her daughter wouldn't - and then the mother lowered her voice - \"because he's black\". Nor would her son: \"he's even more racist\". How horrible to feel impelled to say that of your own children. The jokey-scary commercial paraphernalia of Halloween is all around, but here are America's real ghosts and witches.</p> <p>Missouri matters. It is a national weathervane. Located bang in the middle of the American heartland, where east meets west and north meets south, over the past hundred years it has chosen the winner in every presidential race except one. In the opinion polls, it's among the few states that are still too close to call. That's why Obama was here speaking to massive rallies a fortnight ago, and why both he and Joe Biden are back here again this Thursday. That's why the Obama organisation in Missouri plans to use its 25,000 volunteers to knock on some 1.3m doors during the last four days of the campaign.</p> <p>Most of those key swing voters are in the sprawling, laundered suburbs of St Louis and Kansas City, but every vote from these rural areas, whose native sons include one of the greatest Democratic presidents, Harry Truman, will count too. And I'm in the heart of the rural heartland: beautiful, gently rolling country, with dawn mist rising from cattle ponds, trees turning every impressionist's shade of autumn russet, yellow and red, cows picturesquely munching lush grass, and roadside signs proclaiming Dirt For Sale, and Jesus Is Lord.</p> <p>On the corner of Van Buren and Kosciusko street (Tadeusz Kosciuszko, that is, the Polish freedom fighter who inspired the town's name), I notice a neat, white-painted house with a sign in the window saying \"This House Protected by God\". Out front, a guard dog barks. (A dog called God?) And there's another sign on the lawn: For Sale. The Lord may provide, but people have housing and money worries here as everywhere. And they don't just hunt for the sport. A good shot can put a nourishing turkey or quail on the table for dinner. So the Republicans claim Obama wants to take away your gun. A McCain advertisement on the local country music radio station declares, in a deep countryman's voice, \"We love our God and we love our guns\" - and you can almost hear a second capital G. And, it goes on, \"liberals\" want to take them away, being \"out of touch with our America\".</p> <p>I had expected race to be an issue here, but I'm struck by how close to the surface the old wounds and prejudices are. I don't even have to ask; it just keeps coming up. At the local headquarters of the McCain campaign, four warmly hospitable local ladies tell me about their enthusiasm for Sarah Palin. When the talk turns to the inevitable subject, one of them says people are afraid of being thought racist if they come out against Obama.</p> <p>Another recalls how in her childhood, not so far from here, the Ku Klux Klan was still active, and there were roads a black man could not safely walk.</p> <p>They add that 19th-century Warsaw was a slave town, but Cole Camp, founded by German Lutherans just a few miles to the north in the same county, was not. So Missourians fought about it during the civil war, in the course of which Warsaw was several times burned and razed to the ground.</p> <p>Up the road in Sedalia a former army officer, for many years a staunch Republican, tells me he will vote for Obama. He's disgusted at the way the Bush administration lied to them about Iraq. But it would be easier if Obama were white. In fact, he would find it difficult to vote for him if he were really African-American \"That's black slave American\", he helpfully explains to this foreigner. Those people are so \"mad\" inside, he says, using the word in the colloquial American sense. Fortunately, Obama's not really an African-American, just an American with an African father. But still, he feels \"queasy\" about that.</p> <p>Now don't get me wrong. I'm emphatically not here as a condescending urban liberal, a cultural tourist from the Guardian, hellbent on sneering at these sad, backwoods rednecks, and maligning them as racists. Far from it. These were decent, honest, warm-hearted people I met, and they were acknowledging and frankly wrestling with the problem of residual racism, not propagating it. Nor am I leaping to any conclusion so simplistic as \"race will decide this presidential race\". Mine was a wholly unscientific sample of about 1% of the population (which is 2,070, according to the road sign) of one small town in the conservative rural area of one swing state.</p> <p>Two impressions, however, I do want to share with you. First, for all the consensus of perhaps the most sophisticated pollsters and pundits in the world that Obama is firming up a solid lead in the electoral college, it seems to me that there are unknowns unique to this election, known unknowns and unknown unknowns, which could still swing it either way. If there are too many secret doubts in too many hearts about the otherness of Obama, McCain could just scrape in. If the superbly organised Obama ground campaign gets out voters whom the pollsters may never have reached - young, poor, ethnic minority, even homeless (a judge in Ohio has just allowed homeless voters to register a park bench as their address) - it could be an amazing landslide. I know only enough to doubt the wisdom of any who say they know.</p> <p>You did not read it here first. Next week we will all be wise after the event.</p> <p>The other thing about this election is that, because of the extraordinary Obama and his extraordinary neighbour-to-neighbour campaign, it has become a vast national conversation, not only about the US's future but also about its difficult past. The map of Missouri is weirdly strewn with old European names: Warsaw, Dresden, Windsor, Odessa, Versailles (correct pronunciation: Ver-sails). Old European cities with a lot of history, including much bloodshed and ethnic conflict. But I doubt that in any of them today, perhaps not even in Warsaw, Poland, the wounds of old wrongs still go as deep or throb as hard as they do in their quiet Missourian homonyms, where nice middle-aged Republican ladies can tell you at once who did what to whom nearly 150 years ago.</p> <p>The Obama campaign may prefer to concentrate on the future, but this difficult conversation about America's past is itself also about its future.</p> <p>It's painful and may even be a little risky, but it brings the possibility of healing, especially if enough Americans overcome their secret doubts, their \"queasiness\", and follow Obama's intriguingly worded appeal to \"come together as one nation, one people, and once more choose our better history\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Bath full-back Nick Abendanon has become the latest victim of England's continuing injury jinx amid fears that a toe problem could force him to miss the entire November Test programme. The 22-year-old has been advised to rest his troublesome left big toe for between two and four weeks, ruling him out of contention for Saturday week's opening encounter with the Pacific Islands.</p> <p>Only last week the England management effectively nominated Abendanon as their preferred starting full-back when they promoted him into the senior squad at the expense of the out-of-form Tom Varndell. The team manager, Martin Johnson, has also released Josh Lewsey back to Wasps, leaving Mathew Tait as the only surviving full-back from the original 32-man elite squad. As Tait has a suspect hamstring and has not been a regular at No15 for Sale this season, an unexpected role for London Irish's uncapped Delon Armitage looms ever larger.</p> <p>Johnson is not due to confirm his starting line-up until Tuesday and \"has no plans at this stage\" to summon any more replacements. The fitness of Tait and the similarly hamstrung Luke Narraway of Gloucester remains up in the air, however, and Johnson is increasingly short of depth in certain positions. Jonny Wilkinson and Lewis Moody are already sidelined, with the Leicester hooker George Chuter also out of action this weekend after twisting his left knee in training on Tuesday.</p> <p>If Tait pulls up lame, there is a possibility England will find themselves fielding three debutants in their back division in the shape of Armitage, the Harlequins wing Ugo Monye and the Wasps centre Riki Flutey, all good players but with no history as a collective unit. Abendanon is hardly a grizzled veteran but he has been one of the most impressive performers in this season's Guinness Premiership and has looked more than capable of solving a recurring English problem.</p> <p>Apart from Jason Robinson, none of the recent wearers of the No15 jersey - a list which includes Lewsey, Tom Voyce, Mark Cueto, Olly Morgan, Iain Balshaw, Mike Brown and Tait - has made it his own. Abendanon's pace, vision and improving defence had clearly caught Johnson's eye but the player's hopes of facing the South Sea Islanders evaporated after an examination by England's medical team. They decided to send him for a scan and, while no operation on the big toe joint is required, Abendanon has been told to rest for at least a fortnight.</p> <p>The rest of the squad continued their preparations in Bagshot yesterday and will sit out this weekend's EDF Energy Cup matches under the terms of the eight-year agreement between the Rugby Football Union and the clubs. The main reason for the deal was the RFU's desire for the national team's coaches to spend more time with a fit, healthy group of players. So far, sod's law has consistently applied.</p> <p>The SANZAR nations, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, have failed to agree a common position on the International Board's experimental law variations. As a result the 2009 Tri-Nations and Super 14 tournaments will be played under the same set of laws as this season.</p>",
  "<p>With his new version for Prime Cut Productions, Belfast playwright Owen McCafferty joins the ranks of Irish writers - Tom Paulin, Conall Morrison, Seamus Heaney - who have adapted Antigone in recent years. Set in the aftermath of a civil war, Sophocles's tragedy has intense resonance in post-conflict Northern Ireland. While McCafferty, who also directs, does not update the action explicitly, his urgent script eloquently achieves the transposition.</p> <p>The Chorus, an Old Man, has some of the most blackly comic lines, as he hauls body bags around the broken-down palace. Swearing at each other in the heat of anger, Antigone and her uncle Creon are flawed, all-too-human characters, rather than mouthpieces for a moral argument about the power of the state versus religious allegiance. Ian McElhinney plays Creon as a blunt military man attempting to assert control over the devastated city of Thebes. He struggles to keep his composure in the face of provocation not only from Antigone, but the Old Man and Tiresias. \"You are a whore governed by nothing more than greed and lies,\" he spits at the blind seer.</p> <p>Conflict also boils over between Creon and his defiant son Haimon, superbly played by Paul Mallon. Barely contained physical aggression is evident throughout; McCafferty seems to be straining against the highly disciplined form of Greek tragedy, in which violence is kept offstage. The resulting tension makes the play brilliantly immediate.</p>",
  "<p>These are exciting times for fans of role-playing games. Fable II raised the bar and Fallout 3, if anything, lifts it higher. It's the perfect game for those who love the depth and immersion that RPGs provide, but have a phobia of orcs, goblins and the like. It is set in a gloriously devastated Washington DC after a nuclear war has driven people into underground vaults. You're born in Vault 101 and set up your character during a clever accelerated childhood. When your scientist father escapes when you hit 20, you follow him. What ensues is state of the art, featuring an incredibly convoluted storyline, with vast numbers of side-missions, great control over character development, amazing visuals and an unusual but effective shooting system. Moral dilemmas abound. For example, the first location you find is Megaton, a rickety shanty town constructed around an unexploded atomic bomb. Should you defuse the bomb or explode it, obliterating Megaton? This is the perfect credit-crunch game, as it contains vast amounts of gameplay and replay value.</p>",

A good commander-in-chief, especially one with a lack of military experience (like Clinton, Bartlet, Bush and Obama) considers suggestions as well as issues orders.</p> <h2>Don't react to every provocation</h2> <p>The start of season six sees Bartlet defying the urging of all around him to retaliate for the bombing of a convoy of US officials in Gaza. Instead, he leverages the tension into a Middle East peace conference at Camp David - not what America's enemies would have been expecting.</p> <h2>Use America's power to prevent tragedy</h2> <p>In season four, genocide is perpetrated in a fictional African country clearly based on Rwanda. Where Clinton did nothing while a million people were hacked to death in 1994, Bartlet declares a new doctrine of humanitarian intervention, and sends in the army: \"I got this intelligence summary this afternoon.

If they can get along, so can Obama and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.</p> <h2>Discourage your daughters from dating idiots</h2> <p>May become an issue if Obama wins on Tuesday and serves two terms - by the time he leaves office in January 2017, his daughters will be 19 and 16.

  "<h2>1. The Hon Luke Bridgeman</h2> <p>The year is 1992. The Shamen's Ebeneezer Goode is topping the charts. Stereo MC's Connected isn't far behind. Britain's youth is togged up in ludicrously baggy, post-rave clobber - flared jeans, long T-shirts and bush hats. All except this chap, the heroically benign Hon Luke Bridgeman, who clearly didn't get the memo from Madchester. How old is he? Who knows? Sloanes tend to \"go old\" early on in life and stay in floppy, middle-aged limbo until they die. His fresh face and mummy's boy haircut suggest that he is yet to graduate, but his clothes speak of imminent retirement. Limp Barbour jacket, torn from under parents' dozing labrador worn, \u00e0 la Peter Sallis, with a tweedy tie and a Tattershall check shirt. No man holding a gun has ever looked less threatening. </p> <h2>2. Nat Rothschild</h2> <p>There is something magnificently, unknowingly hip-hop about the way Nat Rothschild has got the top of one of his wellies rolled down. It brings to mind the way that southern-fried rapper Nelly used to roll up one trouser leg. Otherwise ... oh dear. As any stylist knows, layering is always a strong look, but an overlong padded gilet on top of a chunky-knit sweater only works if you are Ted Moult testing the double-glazing in some ghastly country pub. Heir to a \u00a3750m fortune, but he certainly wasn't squandering the family money on clothes. </p> <h2>3. Ifty Riaz</h2> <p>This one is really letting the scruffy side down with his sweetly inappropriate gear. You can image the joshing hilarity that ensued when the clueless chap (whose name, by the way, is an anagram of \"I iz farty\") turned up in his blazer, club tie and suede chukka boots, can't you? \"Ifty, you fucking dolt! This is the glorious 12th not bloody Henley!\" The truth is, shooting is a simple pastime invented for Hooray Henrys who can't play rugby. Shotguns scatter their lead far and wide while the birds are generally fat and slow-flying. You'd have to be a complete doofus not to be able to bag one. Ergo; there's no real need for specialist gear - as long as you are warm, have one good eye and don't have the DTs, you could go shooting in sandals, a fez and a fleecy dressing gown and still be the best gun. So, I'm guessing from his drippy, Merchant Ivory get-up that dear old \"I iz farty\" was the most eagle-eyed crack shot of the bunch. </p> <h2>4. George Latham</h2> <p>Foggy to Hon Luke Bridgeman's Cleggy, ex-infantry officer George Latham's lack of vanity and keen pursuit of anti-fashion borders on the perverse. His ensemble incorporates a baffling example of the entirely nonsensical, tie-worn-under-crew-neck-jumper thing while the slightly disturbing centre-parting has one wondering if Georgie boy went into the barbers and asked for \"a Steve Lamacq\". </p> <h2>5. Baron Lupus Von Maltzhan</h2> <p>This bounder has the brass-necked temerity to be not only German, but also to be wearing a poncy, stone-coloured jacket and have his hair styled like some bloody soccer player. He won't have been invited back.</p> <h2>6. Lord Alexander Hope</h2> <p>The upper middle classes are nothing but resourceful. They were into recycling long ago. Especially where their clothes were concerned. Look at Lord Alexander Hope's gear. Probably bequeathed to him by his father, it's crushingly dull but adaptable and socially acceptable. As it says in The Sloane Ranger Handbook, \"In a sense all shooters are Sloanes because the clothes are standard, the rules are rigid, the ritual perfected for the deference of men against birds.\" It's pulling birds where young Alexander might have a problem ...</p> <h2>7. George Osborne</h2> <p>Respect to George's rather fantastic barnet. It would be too easy and cliched to dismiss it as pre-Four Weddings Hughie Grant because I think he could just as easily be one of Haircut 100. His gear is not too shabby either: girly, over-snug plus-fours, namby-pamby hosiery (those socks are not nearly thick enough to be properly thorn-proof Sloane), but a nice tweedy jacket (very Andre 3000's Benjamin Bixby line) and a well thought-out, tone-on-tone shirt/tie/V-neck combo. Osborne is the best-dressed twerp here. </p> <h2>8. Anon</h2> <p>Hello. I am the unidentified Harry Enfield lookalike who turned up wearing embarassingly unsuitable gear off the Gap sale rail. I am terrified Nat and his chums are going to get drunk, forcibly remove my pleat-top chinos and put bootpolish on my testicles. Again.</p>",
  "<p>I quite had forgotten what an inefficient place a proper office is for working in. In the past fortnight I have spent more consecutive days in an office than at any time since I quit the Independent 11 years ago and started working from home. Nor have there been any huge advances in technology for office productivity: the breakthrough there was the invention 20 years ago of lightweight stereo headphones, which allow you to pretend you are not in the office at all. And though these have got better, smaller, and more widespread, they are hardly new.</p> <p>Against that, the now universal and perhaps inexorable trend of packing workers more closely together makes headphones more necessary and adds the need to be quiet to every conversation. I hate being distracted, but my own processes of thought are probably hugely distracting. I will say out loud a sentence to see if it sounds right. I get up and walk about. I exclaim or swear when struck by an idea: to me a successful newspaper is one that cannot be read in silence, but provokes outbursts of incredulity, laughter and indignation from its readers, and it's best produced in an atmosphere of social noise. I quite see that this is impossible in a tightly packed open plan office.</p> <p>Then there is the business of dealing with other people's computers. It is an unarguable fact that no one else will ever have the software that I am used to, set up the way that I like it. I am almost certainly unusual here. As the relative failure of Adblock Plus shows, most people don't tweak their software in any way at all; and I wouldn't want to argue that tweaking is productive, on balance.</p> <p>But I am dependent on the various electronic scrapbooks I use to collect and collate information: at the moment, Microsoft OneNote and the Firefox extension Zotero. Without those, I don't know what I have been thinking about anything, nor even what I am supposed to be thinking about. I have never yet found an office where there is any widespread adoption of that kind of software: people are discouraged, for obvious reasons, from using their private solutions, and groups tend to just send emails, and if necessary talk to each other.</p> <p>Nor is the office hardware likely to be better. As soon as there are specialist departments whose job it is to ensure that everyone has usable equipment, someone gets lumbered with the sticky space bar and the mouse that scrolls only one way. When I work at home, sagging or second-rate equipment is an occasion for rejoicing. It means I can get a replacement. But in offices, if you have ended up with the keyboard where the space bar works 75% of the time, or the mouse scrolls up but not down, that's tough. There's nothing to be done and no point complaining.</p> <p>What technology has changed is the speed and density of the links that bind external workers into the social mesh of the office. The mixture of email, instant messaging, texting and just plain telephone calls mean that a mid-range mobile phone now offers much more computing power for journalistic purposes than the entire resources of a national newspaper could 10 years ago - and I can put it in my pocket. Laptops are nicer to read and write on, but this is still an astonishing development. If all that journalism needed were technology, then everyone in the western world could be a journalist now.</p> <p>Yet there is still one huge advantage to offices which working at home can never approach. Just as you generate your own efficiencies at home, so do you generate your own inefficiencies: all the perfections of my software and hardware are the result of hours spent not writing. In an office, there are politics and gossip. Outside it, you have to make your own entertainment, but this is as easy as opening a new browser window. There is a law of the conservation of busywork that operates all across the universe. So it does not matter that we could now in principle work more efficiently on a desert island than in the most modern and impersonal office. In the end, technology can never supply the pressure towards productivity supplied by a room full of fellow workers, all apparently busy - even if they are just emailing gossip and YouTube links to one another.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://thewormbook.com/helmintholog\">thewormbook.com/helmintholog</a></p>",
  "<p>Lufthansa signalled its intention to take on British Airways at Heathrow yesterday after the German flag carrier said it would acquire bmi, the airport's second largest airline.</p> <p>Sources close to the transaction also indicated that an agreement with Virgin Atlantic was possible after the carrier controlled by Sir Richard Branson made a public plea to be involved in the deal. Lufthansa is expected to take control of bmi, formerly known as British Midland, after bmi chairman Sir Michael Bishop triggered a put option that requires the airline to buy out his majority stake. </p> <p>The German airline said it saw \"great potential\" in running an enlarged operation out of Heathrow and brushed off concerns that it would damage the competitiveness of its services out of Frankfurt airport .</p> <p>Sir Michael sold a 30% minus one share stake in bmi to Lufthansa in 1999, reducing his holding to 50% plus one share and including a put option that required Lufthansa to buy his stake in a window that opens next January. Lufthansa's announcement prompted the intervention of Virgin Atlantic chief executive Steve Ridgway who issued a statement reminding the German carrier of his airline's long-standing interest in a deal with bmi.</p> <p>\"Everyone has speculated that it would make sense for Virgin Atlantic and bmi to combine their long-haul and short-haul networks. There is now a major opportunity to do that and create a new and even more effective competitor to BA,\" said Ridgway. A deal with Virgin Atlantic is an \"option\", according to sources close to the talks, but the transaction between Sir Michael and Lufthansa cannot be finalised until mid-January under the terms of the shareholding agreement.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, which is Heathrow's fourth largest carrier behind third-placed Lufthansa, is seeking strength in numbers as BA and American Airlines push ahead with a proposed partnership. BA and AA are members of the oneworld airline alliance and have requested regulatory clearance to form a three-way entity with Spain's Iberia. Virgin Atlantic, however, is not even a member of an alliance and would be expected to join bmi and Lufthansa in the Star Alliance group as part of any deal.</p> <p>Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said bmi would have to be restructured as part of any deal because it has a low-fares division, bmibaby, and a regional operation that are unlikely to interest Lufthansa. Bmi reported pre-tax profits of \u00a315.5m last year, down from \u00a329.7m, on turnover that rose by 13% to \u00a31bn, helped by the contribution of Bmed, the former BA franchise it acquired in 2007. Bmi's main asset is its mainline operation, which owns 12% of the slots at Heathrow and operates flights to Europe, the US, Africa and the Middle East. Lufthansa is expected to use those slots as a springboard for challenging BA on one of the most lucrative routes in the airline market - Heathrow to New York.</p> <p>\"I would be surprised if BMI Regional and Baby played a part in Lufthansa's thinking. The option of combining bmi's Heathrow operations with Virgin and bringing the combined entity into Star Alliance is one that should be given serious consideration,\" said Lobbenberg.</p>",
  "<p>As scoops go, the Brand and Ross phone prank row had a rather undramatic birth. Mail on Sunday reporter Miles Goslett was simply, as millions do, listening to the Russell Brand show on Radio 2. Having noted the somewhat risque nature of the call Brand and his guest Jonathan Ross made to Andrew Sachs's answerphone and the subsequent phone calls, Goslett waited to see how the papers would follow the story. </p> <p>He waited several days before putting calls in to Sachs's agent. It seems it was not until the Mail on Sunday asked how Sachs felt about the now notorious line \"he fucked your granddaughter\", that the actor's agent, Meg Pool, was alerted to the broadcast. Reports from inside the BBC yesterday, however, suggested that Sachs had \"reluctantly\" approved broadcast of at least some version of the phone call. </p> <p>Still, according to sources at the Mail on Sunday, Goslett could not believe his luck. Was no one else listening? Or did no one else think it was a story? Put another way, how did an incident that occurred 14 days ago and which no one appeared to have noticed for over a week, claim the scalp of one of the country's highest profile presenters, leave the future of another hanging in the balance, while at the same time reigniting the debate over the purpose of the BBC?</p> <p>Plenty of people were listening, of course, but few have such acute antenna for stories that hit the sweet spots for Associated Newspapers. Brand is a key love-hate figure for the Daily Mail with his louche image and frankly, Paul Dacre-baiting rhetoric. His initial response to the Mail's story was to tell his listeners that the Daily Mail supported fascism in the 1930s and to ask them which they felt was worse, \"leaving a swearword on Andrew Sachs's answerphone or tacitly supporting Adolf Hitler when he took charge of the Third Reich\". A source at the Mail said yesterday that when Brand mentioned Hitler, editor-in-chief Dacre went \"barmy\". </p> <p>By midweek, photographers and reporters were being sent to Italy in an attempt to discover the BBC director-general in his swimsuit while back in London the corporation reeled. At that point the Mail website had been leading with the story solidly for three days. A decision that paid off when first David Cameron and then the prime minister weighed in on Tuesday.</p> <p>But Brand, who became the first casualty last night, is not the reason the story gained such traction over the last four days, and his departure is unlikely to end it. That honour goes to Ross whose record-breaking deal with the BBC, signed two years ago, has served ever since as a lightning rod for every debate about the corporation's public purpose, spending of licence fee payers' cash and distance from its viewers. </p> <p><strong>Lightning rod</strong></p> <p>The deal, at a reported though disputed \u00a318m, caused dismay from the start. It was at the root of an investigation by the BBC Trust into talent pay and has provided a stick for the BBC's commercial rivals to beat the corporation. No presenter could possibly escape unscathed from such scrutiny, especially not one charged with providing cutting edge entertainment programmes. Many senior BBC executives have calculated over the last two years how much of their own output could have been created with the Ross money - three big budget costume dramas; rights to a major sporting event; probably a decade's worth of Newsnight. </p> <p>Channel 4, most recently in the form of Lord Puttnam, its deputy chairman, hasn't hesitated to imply that the BBC was profligate with the licence fee in outbidding them. As one senior BBC broadcaster said yesterday: \"The Jonathan Ross contract was always a hostage to fortune. Our capacity to shoot ourselves in the foot is extraordinary.\"</p> <p>It can't all be explained by the Mail's obsession with Brand or even Ross and the BBC which pays them. The Tories yesterday used the pair as symbols of a coarsening of the culture and an example of how public purpose broadcasting should change, realising the BBC's worst fear that the story would escalate into a debate about how it should be funded and regulated. </p> <p>BBC director-general Mark Thompson has been running a high profile campaign against the media regulator Ofcom in an attempt to stave off the portioning of the licence fee as a way of funding a public service rival to the BBC. This long-running review of the corporation's purposes reaches its conclusion in the next two months. Another scandal questioning the BBC's ability to react to its viewers does not help its cause. Similarly, Ofcom has denied it is looking to expand its remit to regulate the corporation, but BBC executives always suspect that to be the case. </p> <p>A senior executive noted yesterday that there had been a lot of anger inside the corporation, \"some of which has been directed at Brand and Ross, but more of which has been directed at the way the BBC has dealt with it. [If the BBC had reacted earlier] you would have avoided it spiralling out of control into these wider issues about the PSB debate and whether these sorts of shows should be on the BBC. It's all very depressing\".</p> <p><strong>Out of control</strong></p> <p>It was not until lunchtime yesterday - day four of the story - that the director general broke off his holiday in Italy and took control. Thompson, who staked his reputation last year, on being transparent and open with licence fee payers, laid out a schedule. He will report to the BBC Trust today and reveal the results of the inquiry tomorrow. </p> <p>This is where the internal crisis at the BBC lies. Two sore spots, barely healed from last year's catalogue of calamities. There has been a trend in broadcasting to promote marketing figures to run channels and large editorial departments - the thinking goes, at least partly, that marketing skills are needed to \"punch through\" and have impact in our digital age. These figures, however, are left exposed when questions of editorial judgment arise. </p> <p>Secondly, even inside the BBC, it is acknowledged that Middle England feels abandoned by the corporation's chasing of metropolitan youth audiences. By ignoring the exploding numbers of complaints because they don't understand them, the BBC loses touch with its shareholders.</p> <p>Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas is the woman who made the careers of Ross and Brand, reminding a generation of executives how talented a broadcaster Ross is. She also plucked Brand from obscurity, after he was sacked by MTV for dressing up as Osama bin Laden the day after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and gave him a safe haven on the fledgling digital station 6 Music, where he was groomed for televisual rehabilitation. </p> <p>Sources close to Brand indicated yesterday he would rather resign his Radio 2 show than have Douglas be sacrificed. But even though he has quit, it might not be enough. Yesterday, there was a familiar feeling as the BBC descended into rumour and counter-rumour over who exactly approved the broadcast. </p> <p>Never far from civil war, the corporation often descends into backbiting as news colleagues roll their eyes at the antics of their entertainment peers, who in turn feel aggrieved at the rolling coverage of their embarrassment on their own networks. </p> <p>Thompson must be wondering how on earth he finds himself in this position again: two of his highest profile stars suspended, broadcasting schedules in chaos, the Trust demanding an explanation, Ofcom circling with what will have to be a six-figure fine, politicians of both sides firmly seated on the bandwagon and the prospect of losing either a hapless 25-year-old producer, a brand new director of audio or the most successful radio executive of her generation. </p> <p>Worse, if he doesn't get it right, his job's on the line. Again.</p>",
  "<p>Debbie Purdy went to the Royal Courts of Justice because she was determined that when she died her husband would be there with her to hold her hand. </p> <p>Yesterday, after she was defeated in a landmark legal action on assisted suicide to protect him from prosecution, the terminally-ill MS sufferer said that she now faced travelling to Switzerland alone to commit suicide before she was ready.</p> <p>Two high court judges rejected Purdy's request for guidelines from the Director of Public Prosecutions on when assisted suicide cases would be prosecuted, saying it was a matter for parliament and not the courts. However, they granted an appeal on the grounds of public interest, which would be expedited because of Purdy's terminal condition.</p> <p>More than 90 families have journeyed with sick relatives from the UK to countries where assisted suicide is legal, unsure whether they would be arrested upon return. As the law stands, they could be jailed for 14 years; but while many of these cases have been investigated by the police, none has led to a prosecution. </p> <p>Purdy, from Bradford, wanted to be certain that her husband, Omar Puente, would not face prison if he took her to the Dignitas clinic near Zurich to help her die. She argued that the practice of tacitly ignoring such acts should be official policy. After the ruling yesterday, she told the Guardian: \"I would be heartbroken if Omar could not hold my hand while I died. It would be the worst thing I could ever imagine. Ambulance men hold people's hands because they don't want them to die alone. It would break Omar's heart if he could not hold mine, and that would be heartbreaking for me.\"</p> <p>She said she would prefer to take her life whilst still physically capable of acting alone - even if mentally unprepared for death - rather than risk her condition degenerating until she became powerless. \"It would be no fun at all to know that, if I lose my ability to go to Switzerland myself, my husband would face 14 years in prison. For me that would be emotional torture. That's not something I would be prepared to allow to happen. I love the man, we have spent 13 years protecting each other.\"</p> <p>Beside her, Puente, a violinist from Cuba, said he would rather go to jail than have his wife of 14 years die without him in the clinic. \"Of course I am going to help her go to Switzerland,\" he said. </p> <p>His wife, who said she would appeal against yesterday's ruling, is determined to prevent him, unless there is a change of law and there are clear guidelines which say he will not face charges as a result of her death.</p> <p>Purdy has yet to make any specific decision to take her life, and is filled with uncertainty about the stark choices ahead, but she said: \"I just want to know that my husband is not laying himself open to possible prosecution if that is what I decided to do.\" </p> <p>In their ruling Lord Justice Scott Baker and Mr Justice Aikens said: \"We cannot leave this case without expressing great sympathy for Ms Purdy, her husband and others in a similar position who wish to know in advance whether they will face prosecution for doing what many would regard as something that the law should permit, namely to help a loved one go abroad to end their suffering when they are unable to do it on their own. </p> <p>\"This would involve a change in the law. The offence of assisted suicide is very widely drawn to cover all manner of different circumstances; only parliament can change it.\"</p> <p>It remains illegal to assist the suicide of another in the UK but it is not specifically illegal in some European countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. A file on the parents of Daniel James, the 23-year-old former rugby player who ended his life last month, has been passed to the CPS.</p> <p>The judges said the code for prosecutors issued by the DPP, coupled with the general safeguards of administrative law, satisfied human rights convention standards and the need for \"clarity and foreseeability\". </p> <p>Arguing for the release of guidelines, Purdy's lawyers argued that theyare used frequently in other prosecutions such as domestic violence, bad driving and football-related offences. But the judges said this was so because such offences were a prevalent social problem, and hence in such cases \"it was clearly imperative the public should understand the specific criteria that the DPP and Crown prosecutors would employ in deciding whether to prosecute them\". </p> <p>By contrast, the number of possible offences in assisted suicide was \"not large\". They added: \"It is desirable to have a degree of flexibility in the law in this area.\" </p> <p>Purdy had claimed that by failing to clarify her husband's position, the DPP was violating her right to a private life as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. The judges said that guarantee only prohibited interference in the way a person lived their life, not on how they wished to die.</p> <p>Outside the court, she said she felt as if she had \"been been kicked in the guts\" by the judges' ruling, though she said she was pleased they had granted her the right to appeal and that it was to be expedited. </p> <p>\"It's a race against time, though you don't know how much time you have got: it could be weeks, months, years. What I do know is I can't take the risk of deteriorating fast. Parliament should discuss what needs to be done. If people talk about needing safeguards to protect the vulnerable, we have to know what is necessary to protect them. Everyone seems to want to keep their head below the parapet but this needs to be discussed.\"</p> <p>Supporting his wife, Puente said: \"The doctor can give her painkillers, I can provide love; but the law isn't clear.\"</p> <p>Paul Bowen, Purdy's barrister, said: \"The situation where the prosecuting authorities turn a blind eye because they don't want to prosecute people in these cases means that the issue, up until now, has not been on the radar. This matter needs to be on the political agenda.\"</p> <p>Representing the DPP, Jeremy Johnson had said there was no compelling reason for the case to be heard on appeal. He said: \"Only parliament can provide Debbie Purdy with the remedy she seeks.\"</p>",
  "<p>Opposition politicians have accused the government of \"arrogantly\" misusing its oversight of parliamentary business, as it emerged yesterday that the number of days MPs would attend parliament in the next session would be the smallest since 1979-80. </p> <p>Parliament is scheduled to sit for 128 days after the state opening by the Queen on December 3, but research by Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes indicates that this is the fewest number of days of a parliamentary session in a non-election year since 1979-80. </p> <p>George Young, a former Tory minister, member of the Conservative party's democracy taskforce and tipped as a candidate for the position of Speaker when Michael Martin steps down, raised the issue during prime minister's questions yesterday, claiming that his research indicated the next session would be the shortest in a non-election year since the second world war.</p> <p>Young said the reduced amount of time was at odds with a commitment made by the prime minister in his first statement to the house to allow greater scrutiny of the government. </p> <p>Gordon Brown said he believed his government had already transferred power from the executive to parliament and referred to legislation that would give parliament the right to vote before the country goes to war. He said: \"If the House of Commons believes it can complete its work within 128 days then that is the best course of action.\"</p> <p>Hughes said: \"The government is arrogantly using its majority to keep decisions about the sitting of parliament under its control and bringing the House of Commons into disrepute in the process. </p> <p>\"Parliament should decide when we meet and how.\"</p> <p>The next parliamentary session will be the last before a general election must be called in May 2010 and critics said the decision to concertina next year was a political strategy. </p> <p>A former government minister said the small number of days being sat was \"not a silly thing for Gordon to do in the parliamentary year before an election\". </p> <p>But Labour backbenchers and campaigners to improve the accountability of parliament were not convinced that the length of a parliamentary session was particularly important.</p> <p>Frank Dobson, a Labour backbencher said: \"The point is that it is not about how long we sit but rather that we just aren't very effective in what we do.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Harriet Harman, leader of the House of Commons, said the 128 figure did not include parliamentary days that would be scheduled for November 2009 when the government would have a clearer idea of outstanding business after next autumn's conference season.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> failed to respond to warning signs of a looming recession and had been wrong to delay cutting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> until too late to stop growth contracting and unemployment rising sharply, a member of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) said last night.</p> <p>Speaking as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/30/interest-rates-us-economy\">US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to just 1%</a> in an attempt to halt a slump in activity, David Blanchflower launched an outspoken attack on his eight MPC colleagues, saying the Bank had been too optimistic about the UK's ability to survive the global crisis, and Britain would now endure 18 months of falling output as it felt the full impact.</p> <p>The Bank is expected to follow the Fed's lead by cutting at least half a percentage point off UK rates next week, although some analysts want a one point cut after news the economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>Blanchflower's intervention came as David Cameron attempted to pile the pressure on Gordon Brown when the Tory leader challenged the prime minister to admit that his fiscal rules were now dead and he was planning a \"spending splurge\".In their most bruising encounter in the crisis, Brown hit back at prime minister's questions by accusing the Tories of mixed messages, saying in one breath that it was right to increase borrowing in a recession and saying in another that it was not.</p> <p>Cameron asked of the fiscal rules: \"Why will he not now admit that they are dead? Let us just remember them - he used to be so proud of them. Rule one was: 'Only borrow to invest'; now he is having to borrow to pay for unemployment benefit. That rule is dead. Rule two was: 'Don't have debt over 40% of national income.' Even on his own fiddled figures, that rule is now dead. Why will he not admit that the rules failed to deliver responsibility in the good years and that, as soon as the bad times came, they collapsed completely?\"</p> <p>In a speech last night, chancellor Alistair Darling said it would be \"perverse\" to stick rigidly to the rules during a downturn.</p> <p>Blanchflower was a lone voice on the MPC calling for cuts in interest rates this summer. Speaking in Canterbury last night he criticised fellow MPC members for ignoring his warnings. \"I believe the trend has been apparent for some time. The synchronised downturn in so many surveys should have led us to realise sooner that the UK economy was entering a recession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If rates are not cut aggressively [when the MPC meets next week] we do face the prospect of a relatively deep and long-lasting recession.\"</p> <p>In his speech, he said tighter credit conditions imposed by banks had yet to be fully felt. Policymakers faced an \"unusually severe\" international financial problem, possibly more significant than 1929, a crash which principally involved bank failures in the US. \"The current difficulties in financial markets are more comparable to what happened in world war one, when stock exchanges in several countries closed for extended periods.\"</p> <p>The MPC had been reluctant to cut rates during the summer as inflation rose to a 16-year-high of 5.2% in September.</p> <p>Blanchflower said the MPC had over-reacted to the threat of higher imported oil and food prices repeating the 1970s inflationary spiral. But workers' bargaining power was weaker now, with little chance that they could push up wages in response to rising prices.</p> <p>\"In its last health check on the economy, released in August, the Bank said it expected output to be flat over the coming year, with employment falling a little. Output growth was expected to recover in 2009 as energy prices fell, the credit crunch eased and a weaker pound helped exports. This was an optimistic view,\" Blanchflower said. \"Clearly output is now beginning to contract, but I think this likelihood was apparent in August.\"</p> <p>He added that at last month's MPC meeting some had argued for higher borrowing costs. \"I was alone in voting for an immediate cut of half a percentage point. I am concerned about the detrimental effect of recent events in financial markets on the UK economy,\" he said, adding that the 0.5% drop in GDP had occurred mainly before this autumn's market meltdown.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's local councils - custodians of vast amounts of electronic data about our lives and local environments - have received a ticking off for their tardiness in freeing data. The Power of Information Task Force, set up earlier this year to promote web 2.0 thinking across the government, this month warned councils that they could face prosecution unless they publish terms and conditions for reusing their data. The task force also urges councils to waive powers to charge fees.</p> <p>Local government has emerged as a major obstacle to setting taxpayer-funded data free for reuse. Unlike central government bodies, local authorities (including police forces) hold the copyright in data they produce, and some see it as a potential source of revenue. Earlier this year, a study found that only one-fifth offered data under the government's recommended \"click use\" licence.</p> <p>New draft guidance from the Power of Information Task Force urges councils to get on board. \"If everyone adopts the same approach to licensing, it will be easier for everyone to reuse local authority information - including local authorities themselves! Using the same licence across central and local government means that all our public sector information can be used together more easily and simply.\"</p> <p>The task force warns that councils wanting to trade information could be breaking the law. \"Councils are often monopoly information holders. If you trade unfairly and someone complains, you will be investigated by the Office of Public Sector Information - a process that will take time and cost money.\" </p> <p>Not all authorities are laggards. Kent county council said this week that it is shortly to pilot a free data scheme on its website. The idea, says Noel Hatch, projects and research lead in the council's innovation team, is to take data that the council already publishes in hard-to-use formats and make it easily available to community groups to mix and match in mashups. \"People will be able to mix our information with that being released by other services, and with online tools such as Google Maps or Flickr,\" he says. </p> <p>The idea that free data can be a force for digital and social inclusion also appears - fleetingly - in the latest cross-government technology strategy to emerge from Whitehall. The Digital Inclusion Action Plan, published for consultation, says: \"Future challenges include considering how to ... promote innovative ways of providing all sectors of the public with better information about public services.\" </p> <p>But we'd suggest it goes much further.</p> <p>\u2022 Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog: <a href=\"http://freeourdata.org.uk/blog\">freeourdata.org.uk/blog</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Our mission is to change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators,\" says the publisher Tim O'Reilly with typical northern California enthusiasm. \"I always put my faith in the hackers,\" he smiles. </p> <p>O'Reilly Media is synonymous with high-quality technical reference. It's not as dry as it sounds: it releases an impressive number of books and manuals a year, ranging from tech to travel, and the 54-year old so-called meme-peddler from Sebastopol, CA, has become the guru of technologists around the world. His successful balance of content and spin - and his ability to spot the communities that have crossover potential - means that he has become both spiritual father to alpha geeks worldwide and translator to the masses. Most people associate him with devising the \"iterate and iterate often\" manifesto of the web 2.0 philosophy, but that notch is just one of the web revolutions on his bedpost. </p> <p><strong>Vibrant hackers</strong></p> <p>Last week, his enthusiasm drew a vibrant community of hackers from across Europe to the first non-US O'Reilly Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin. The cosmopolitan capital's bullish optimism, reflected in the glass buildings of the new skyscrapers at Potsdamer Platz and the influx of creatives seeking cool and chic at affordable prices, is attractive to a community that itself was in the doldrums less than a decade ago. </p> <p>\"Our corporate mission for 2003 was to reignite enthusiasm in the computer industry,\" O'Reilly offers. \"Everyone was in the dumps after the dotcom bust, and we wanted to tell a story that made people see how much was actually still going on.\" The aim was to market the web rather than the books, and so its first release, The Whole Internet User's Guide and Manual, came with a free copy of the internet. \"We started the Global Network Navigator, the first commercial website, as a way of promoting the net.\" A few years later, he worked with another community to establish the open-source movement, again to promote his products.</p> <p>O'Reilly's latest contribution to the lexicon of the internet has captured the imaginations of creative, corporate and governmental industries. \"Web 2.0\" is a buzzword for the new medium, a constantly updating feedback system evolving at the speed of light. It's become the must-do-or-die killer app that's inspired a social media gold rush that many in the traditional corporate world admit they don't have a grip on. </p> <p>The biggest stumbling block, and that which O'Reilly is trying to overcome on his latest speaking tour, is that both the consumer and the company must sacrifice their control in order to succeed with web 2.0. For enterprise, this means accepting negative PR rather than controlling the brand image. For the customer, this means losing control of more and more personal data in order to get the most out of a service. O'Reilly is keen to point out the positives to both parties. He uses the example of Wasabi, which uses credit card data to identify consumer trends for social recommendations: \"Every swipe of a credit card is a vote. If you go to a restaurant once and never come back, it doesn't really tell you anything. But if your credit card data says that you go back two, three or four times, that tells you something about that restaurant that's way more powerful than you might get with an explicit review.\"</p> <p><strong>Got your number</strong></p> <p>While enthusiastic, his spin doesn't address the potential privacy infringements that leave many consumer rights activists concerned. He parries that blow: \"With web 2.0, how the application is using your personal data is front and centre in the interface versus something that's hidden behind the closed doors of your bank, where they figure out whether or not they'll give you a loan based on the results of the obscure algorithms that only they know,\" he argues. \"Because it's consumer-focused, the customer can see what's going on, can control it, can respond to it and can opt out.\"</p> <p>This assumes that the customer recognises that the data is being extracted and used, and is able realistically to assess its long-term value in light of the immediate benefits that are on offer. As others have noted, this isn't always the case, particularly when using opt-out paradigms. But O'Reilly is optimistic that attitudes towards data ownership will change. To him, evidence points to what consumers will do in future: \"When the Facebook feed was first launched, there was a lot of backlash about that from a privacy point of view. But that kind of lifestreaming now is a whole industry. People adjusted.\" </p> <p>He doesn't offer any more on how people adjust, or what implications there may be. He's focused on the bright lights of a technological future, and he will be guiding the way. \"Peddling a meme is really about helping people to see what's possible,\" he says. And for O'Reilly, to do it successfully means adding value where he sees something that really matters. He'll think about the cost later.</p>",

The 23-year-old Wigan loose-forward has been named in the Samoa team who will face Tonga at the Penrith Stadium, having opted to represent the ancestry of his father Shane and mother Natalie, who still live on the East Lancs Road having moved from Auckland to Salford when Hansen was a boy.</p> <p>Hansen may be a relative newcomer to the 1,000-year-old rivalry between the two Pacific nations but Tonga's team manager and director, William Edwards, warned him yesterday to prepare for the toughest game of his life - and possibly the most brutal in the 54-year history of the rugby league World Cup.</p> <p>\"There's been fireworks every time we've played so I'm expecting fireworks again,\" said Edwards. \"It is just a matter of whether we need the fire department to come and put those flames out in the form of boys in blue or officials from the World Cup. Against Samoa it's not about intelligence, it's about confrontation.\"</p> <p>Hansen is well aware of that already. \"I don't think there's any doubt it's going to be a pretty physical game,\" he said. \"We're treating it like a local derby, although it's a bit different to Wigan v St Helens. I'll just try to stay out of the way of those big Tongan boys early on, because the coach is looking for me to play a lot of minutes. I might have to keep my head down.\"</p> <p>Extra police have been put on stand-by in case the rivalry boils over off the field, and the teams have been asked to perform their respective hakas separately. \"Ours is called the siva tau and all the boys have been working on it,\" Hansen said.</p> <p>That will be new territory for him, and a long way from the days when he attended the same Swinton school as Ryan Giggs before going on to represent England at various schoolboy levels, including featuring in the Under-17 side captained by James Graham - now of St Helens - that claimed a ground-breaking series victory over the Australian Institute of Sport five years ago.</p> <p>\"But deep down I've always thought of myself as a Kiwi even though I grew up in England,\" he added. \"I put my hand up to play for New Zealand when they played a mid-season Test against Great Britain a couple of years back, but then the Samoa coach, John Ackland, found out about my family background and asked if I'd come on board for the World Cup.</p> <p>\"It's the best decision I've ever made. Playing in the qualifiers last year was awesome and we've just had a week over in Samoa preparing for the World Cup. I had never been there before and my cousin took me to our village and I met up with loads of other members of the family. My dad's mother is Samoan-Chinese and my mum's family are Samoan-Scottish. It was the first time in Samoa for quite a few of the other boys, too, and that trip has strengthened the bonds we already had as a group. We really think we have the ability to make a big impact in this World Cup.\"</p> <p>With a squad including other notable Super League figures such as Hansen's Wigan team-mate George Carmont, the Leeds prop Kylie Leuluai, Bradford's David Solomona and Leeds's Ali Lauitiiti, Samoa fancy their chances of coming through what is effectively a six-team qualifying tournament to join Australia, New Zealand and England in the semi-finals.</p> <p>But they will need to hit the ground running against a Tonga team who should be more cohesive, albeit not as fresh, after beating Ireland 22-20 in the thriller in Parramatta on Monday. Not that the build-up to tomorrow's game has contained many references to rugby. It is the grudge between the nations which has captured the imagination, encouraged by provocative comments from the two camps.</p> <p>Yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald ran a piece claiming that the teams had \"lost interest in sticking it to each other verbally\" but in the rival Daily Telegraph the Tonga coach, Jim Dymock, insisted that \"Tonga and Samoa have always hated each other with a passion. It will be do or die. Both sides will rip in. We once ruled their country\". Hansen may be in for quite a night.</p>",
  "<p>It sounds too good to be true. A human rights campaigner, who bears the injuries of the torture he received in jail, topples Asia's longest-serving despot in a democratic election. But it has just happened in the tropical Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives. The election of Mohamed \"Anni\" Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, had people dancing in the streets of the island's capital, Mal\u00e9, yesterday. The president-elect said he would not pursue criminal charges against Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the strongman he defeated, but would instead arrange a pension and security for him. This is a good start, but the charismatic former opposition leader will soon face other tests. The five opposition parties that Nasheed united includes everyone from democrats to conservative Islamic parties, and unity will be difficult to maintain as elections approach for a new parliament in March. Nasheed campaigned for a stronger parliament with the ability to check presidential powers and block appointments to the cabinet. As president, it will be up to him to make this system work. Autocracy brought wealth to the atolls but also glaring inequalities. Nearly a third of children are malnourished and the archipelago has a big drug problem. It also faces rising sea levels. The IMF is urging a cut in public spending and Nasheed inherits an economy which earns 28% of its income from tourism, a sure casualty of the global downturn. His honeymoon will not last long.</p>",
  "<p>The number of ways in which Barack Obama could still lose the US presidential election is diminishing by the day - it'd take an extramarital affair with a gay terrorist, at this point, or a historically unprecedented failure of polling methods - but when you say this to die-hard liberals in American coastal cities, their faces darken. They look at you like you're bringing bad luck across their threshold; normally non-superstitious people reach to touch wooden tables. They remember the morning of November 3 2004 when they awoke - if they'd slept - to find that George Bush had squeaked through to a second term. Whatever the polls might be saying this time round, liberals harbour a nebulous dread that their fragile hopes are about to be dashed all over again. </p> <p>And it could happen. But the curious and consoling truth is that even if it does, you'll probably be far less upset than you think. (I'm using \"you\", here, in recognition of the statistical likelihood that, as a Guardian reader with an interest in the US election, you're an Obama supporter. If your candidate's McCain, though, it's still relevant - even more so, given the chances of a Republican defeat next week.) On November 5 four years ago, the cover of G2 bore only the words \"Oh, God,\" in tiny letters on a dark background, which well captured the despondency in liberal Europe that morning. But for most of us, that feeling - the deep, real and personal sense of unhappiness, as opposed to the ideological, intellectual opposition to the Bush administration and its policies - didn't last. It rarely does: the overwhelming evidence from social psychology is that we're terrible at \"affective forecasting\": we chronically overestimate how sad we'll be, and for how long, in the wake of a negative event, and how happy we'll be after a positive one.</p> <p>The reigning monarch of affective forecasting research, the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, conducted a strikingly relevant study on this subject in 1996, when the Democratic governor of Texas, Ann Richards, was being challenged for the office by one George Bush. Republicans questioned prior to election day thought they'd become much happier if Bush won, while Democrats thought they'd become much less happy; one month after the result, however, their reported happiness levels were essentially the same as before. We grow swiftly numb to good new things, and explain away bad ones. \"People are wonderful rationalisers,\" Gilbert later said. \"They will rearrange their view of the world so it doesn't hurt as much.\" After Bush's victory in Texas, Democrats rationalised with vigour. \"The governor of Texas really doesn't have much power,\" they told Gilbert - and, \"He wants to be president, so he's not going to do anything too dumb or crazy.\" Gilbert repeated the experiment with Democrats in the 2004 election. He replicated his results, but also discovered a coda: six months after the election result, Bush opponents also remembered being much more upset than they really were. We'll never learn to be better predictors of our own happiness, it seems, because we habitually forget how wrong we were.</p> <p>Naturally, as in every election, there'll be exceptions. If Obama wins and his policies lift you, personally, above the poverty line, your happiness may be enduring; if you're a campaign staffer, the sting of his defeat isn't going to lift within a week. Our personal investment in this election is far greater than in many past cases. (Besides, all this talk of happiness levels among middle-class liberals is rather indulgent; there are countless reasons to back Obama that don't concern his effect on your mood.) Almost certainly, though, come November 15 or thereabouts, the identity of the next American president will simply be competing for your attention with far too many other things to have a decisive effect on your spirits. Strangely, just about the only person in the US political arena at the moment who gives a convincing impression that he wouldn't be particularly emotionally thrown, one way or the other, by Obama winning or losing, is Obama himself. (When the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, William Weld, endorsed him last week, he cited exactly this \"classy, steady calm\" as the reason.) Which is, when you think about it, bizarre - but then when did a non-bizarre person ever become president?</p> <p>Personally, I'm more worried about withdrawal symptoms: not the identity of the winner, but the abrupt halt, after so many months, of the race. It's hard to imagine the day will come when I won't be interested to know about a three-point shift in the voting preferences of white Catholics in Virginia, or the scale of the Republican National Committee's TV advertising purchases in Colorado, but presumably it will. Actually, a scarier thought: maybe it won't. Come 2010 - as the ever more greying President Obama dials back on another policy promise, citing the absence of funds - perhaps I'll still be sitting in a darkened room, compulsively checking <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com\">TalkingPointsMemo.com</a> and the Gallup daily tracking poll, over and over, like a conditioned laboratory rat, or a formerly captive bear that doesn't realise it's been freed.</p> <p>\u2022 This week Oliver <strong>watched too many election spoofs on YouTube</strong>: \"At this frazzled stage, you don't even need to make a clever satirical point, so people just say, 'I'm John McCain', then gurn at the camera.

  "<p>It may be the election of a lifetime, a unique chance to change the course of history, redraw the electoral map and reposition America in the world.</p> <p>But for Californian voters, it is all about the chickens. On the other side of the country in Massachusetts, voters are mulling over the merits of greyhounds, while in Alaska they have wolves and bears on their minds.</p> <p>This year, US voters will be faced not just with the stark choice between the presidential candidates, but also with a flurry of ballot propositions.</p> <p>Also known as ballot initiatives, or measures, they are allowed in 36 of the 50 states. These ballots epitomise the business of direct democracy in the US, providing a way for individuals, interest groups and just about anybody who can raise enough signatures and enough money to place a proposal before voters. A 50% majority is required for a ballot proposal to pass and become law. But more than half fail to get enough votes. </p> <p>\"Ballot measures are intended to give the public a say in state government in a way that representative democracy might not always do,\" said Kareem Crayton, an assistant professor of law and political science at the University of Southern California (USC).</p> <p>This year there will be 153 state-wide ballot initiatives, addressing issues from taxation to transport, from gambling to energy. That figure is down from the 2004 presidential election, when voters faced 162 ballot propositions. As a recent report from USC's Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute declares: \"This is looking to be a down year for direct democracy.\"</p> <p>That is not what California's chickens - or to give them their legal definition, egg-laying poultry - might say, should they be able to talk. Up for voter consideration in the state is proposition 2. Known as the standards for confining farm animals initiative, it would prohibit the confinement of chickens, veal calves and pregnant pigs in a manner that does not allow the animal to lie down, stand up, turn around or spread their wings. </p> <p>The measure, which according to the polls stands a good chance of passing into law, has caused a flap. It has also proved a boon for headline writers in search of bad puns.</p> <p>Animal rights groups have lined up against the food industry to make their cases, buoyed by an estimated $14m (\u00a38.6m) raised by the two sides. And this being California, the measure has attracted high-profile supporters: Ellen DeGeneres touted the measure on her talk show, while Oprah Winfrey devoted an hour-long programme to it.</p> <p>Yet while the ballot initiative process has often been rightly criticised for introducing frivolity into elections, it also offers a way to raise issues of legitimate concern to parts of the electorate.</p> <p>In South Dakota an initiative on the ballot this year would allow the state to fine those who engage in short selling. \"Short what?\" asked the political class when the idea was first mooted in 2007. A year on, and the initiative has found its moment, as the practice of borrowing stock and selling it when the price is about to drop has been identified as an early villain in the financial meltdown.</p> <p>Financial and taxation measures have been initiative staples over the past 110 years that the method has been in use. The most famous is California's proposition 13 in 1978 which placed a cap on property taxes. This year, 24 of the 153 ballots concern raising, lowering or recalculating taxes.</p> <p>Social issues are also a favourite: gay marriage is on the ballot in four states, abortion in three, while Washington state gets to vote on assisted suicide, and voters in Michigan can decide on the desirability of stem cell research in their state.</p> <p>Thus in Colorado, indeed a proposition-happy state, voters will be asked to rule on a question that Barack Obama memorably declared was \"above my pay grade\": at what point does human life begin? The initiative proposes to amend Colorado's constitution to state that a \"person ... shall include any human being from the moment of fertilisation\".</p> <p>In South Dakota, the abortion ban initiative aims to prohibit all abortions except for those carried out in cases of rape, incest or to protect a woman's health. \"If this passes, doctors will not perform abortions because the wording is too vague,\" said Kristina Wilfore, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Centre in Washington DC. </p> <p>\"This is a red state, a state with the strictest anti-abortion laws already in place. This is about setting a test case for Roe v Wade. It will be a nail-biter.\"</p> <p>But the political winds, not to mention the economy, have made the ballot proposition less fertile terrain for social conservatives. Many initiatives, including anti-abortion measures in Oregon, Georgia and Montana, failed to make the ballot this year because supporters could not drum up the required number of signatures. \"They have failed because they are out of synch and too extreme,\" said Wilfore. \"Is defining a foetus a person in Colorado the most important thing this year?\"</p> <p>One ballot initiative that has captured the imagination of social conservatives across the country is California's proposition 8, which \"eliminates [the] right of same-sex couples to marry\". Opponents and supporters of the measure have raised more than $60m between them to fight their fights, with the Catholic group Knights of Columbus lined up against the likes of Steven Spielberg, Brad Pitt and poultry-loving DeGeneres.</p> <p>The battle illustrates a weakness of the system: proposition 8 has been bankrolled by donors from outside California. The main funder is the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints. Mormons, following an appeal from the church whose stronghold is in Utah, have donated around $10m to the cause.</p>",

Reports suggested he was shouting: \"I'm going to show her how much I love her.\" One said: \"He pointed the gun and said 'kids, go home where you belong'.\" </p> <p>Scotland Yard said that police went to the area at 1.40pm after reports of a violent argument at a property, then requested armed support from the Metropolitan police firearms unit, CO19. Firearms officers had confronted the man. </p> <p>A woman said: \"He started off with one gun, then had three guns. One was massive, a big black thing like an air rifle. I heard him talking on the phone to the police - 'I don't care if you shoot me, I'll show her that I'll die for her'. We heard about four or five shots.\" </p> <p>Another woman said he had been in the courtyard in front of her home. \"I saw a bald man wearing a black T-shirt. He was quite chubby, and he had two black guns and was waving them in the air.\"</p> <p>James Tate, 25, said the shooting took place in the courtyard, which was also outside the man's home. \"I came running across the road to see what was going on.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339115564\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>In the shanty towns of Buenos Aires they used to call him el pibe, Argentine slang for the little kid. But yesterday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/diego-maradona\">Diego Maradona</a>, the diminutive Argentine footballer whose ball skills and ruthless cunning have granted him almost mythical status in his home country, was on the verge of becoming el maestro with his imminent appointment as manager of the national team.</p> <p>The decision by the normally conservative president of the Argentina Football Association, Julio Grondona, marks an astonishing comeback for a controversial player who came close to death in 2004 when he spent 10 days in intensive care with respiratory problems following what was thought to have been a cocaine-induced heart attack. </p> <p>Only four years earlier, he had been voted the best footballer of the 20th century in a poll of fans for Fifa. He has also endured hospitalisation with alcohol-induced liver problems and underwent gastric bypass surgery for obesity in a Colombian clinic. In 1994 he was ejected from the World Cup in the US after he tested positive for ephedrine, a fact that might have been obvious to anyone who saw him run up to a pitchside camera and scream into its lens, eyes bulging unnaturally after he scored his only goal of the tournament against Greece.</p> <p>But with Argentina's two-time World Cup winning side in the doldrums in recent internationals, drawing six in a row earlier this year, Grondona hopes Maradona's presence will galvanise the team. \"I have wanted Maradona to be coach of the national team since 1979,\" said Grondona in a radio interview on Wednesday, following talks with the 48-year old. \"In Argentine football there is a before and and after Maradona.\"</p> <p>Maradona indicated yesterday that he would rein in his famously volatile emotions when he becomes boss. \"It makes me really happy that my parents will see me walk out as coach of the national team,\" he said. \"But I don't want to cry. The national team needs a man who will make people smile, not cry, who will give them something to enjoy, not suffer.\"</p> <p>He also said his lack of managerial experience - which runs to a total of 23 games with modest provincial club Deportivo Mandiyu and then Racing Club, in the mid 1990s - would be no problem. \"They talk about my inexperience but I've spent 20-odd years in the Argentina team,\" he said. \"That's why it makes me laugh when people talk about inexperience.\"</p> <p>But Maradona is impulsive, unpredictable and temperamental. For some in Argentina, it is almost as if Paul Gascoigne, whose personal and professional trajectory has closely mirrored that of Maradona, had taken control of the England team - an unthinkable prospect here.</p> <p>Both number 10s were hailed as the greatest footballers of their era but lost control through drink and drugs. Among the Argentine public yesterday there seemed to be limited enthusiasm for Maradona's appointment, despite hopes it might deliver cheer as their economy is struggling again. Online polls for daily newspapers La Naci\u00f3n and Clarin reported that around three-quarters of respondents disapproved.</p> <p>Reflecting Maradona's sometimes volatile character, Carlos Tevez, the Manchester United and Argentina striker who Maradona once described as \"the Argentine prophet for the 21st century\", said: \"Diego needs to think more with his head than his heart now that he's coach.\"</p> <p>If the appointment is confirmed, as expected in Argentina, there appeared to be trouble ahead for one of the team's star players. It was reported that Maradona has previously branded Barcelona midfielder Lionel Messi too selfish in his play. Messi has been dubbed the new Maradona for his similar build and dribbling wizardry.</p> <p>\"There will be no problem,\" said Messi yesterday. \"He is a great. I admire him for what he has given to Argentine soccer. I am optimistic.\"</p> <p>\"His charisma will make the players follow him 100%,\" said Italy coach Marcello Lippi, who lifted the 2006 World Cup. \"They will listen to him like an oracle.\"</p> <p>Most England fans have a love-hate relationship with Maradona after the \"hand of God\" incident where he scored a goal with his hand to help knock England out of the 1986 World Cup. But he is also respected, alongside Pele, as perhaps the greatest footballer of all time. To some of his countrymen, he means more than that. On his 43rd birthday in 2003, fans in Rosario established the \"Church of Maradona\" and decided 2003 should be 43DD, \"despu\u00e9s de Diego\" or after Diego.</p> <p>\"Maybe he's risking too much, as always in his life,\" wrote Daniel Arcucci, a columnist for La Naci\u00f3n, reflecting on his appointment. \"Even his status as a myth.\"</p>",

Rodin was the last truly convincing Romantic sculptor. Believing that \"nothing is as beautiful as beauty in its ruin\", he moulded figures that look lived-in. Just feel the tensile sinews in those chunky feet. <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (30BC-20BC) - Wall paintings from the Villa of Livia</h2> <p> It's hard to imagine a more delightful and harmonious room than this, from the villa of Livia, wife of the emperor Augustus. The walls are covered in fantastically preserved, delicate paintings of a garden: oleander, pine, quince and pomegranate trees on which delicate birds have alighted. <strong>(Charlotte Higgins)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (64-68) - Paintings from the Domus Aurea</h2> <p> Nero's palace was a splendid affair, partially gilded - hence the name Domus Aurea, or \"Golden House\". Its elaborate wall paintings were discovered in the 15th century: artists such as Raphael clambered down with candles to see the subterranean remains and incorporated what they saw into their own work. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (before 79) - Secret Cabinet, Naples </h2> <p>When excavations started at Pompeii and Herculaneum, sexually explicit finds, including frescoes of copulating couples and reliefs of phalluses, were commonplace. In 1819 the King of Naples removed them to a secret \"cabinet\", which can now be seen by ordinary mortals. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (before 79) - Painted frieze from the Hall of the Mysterie; Portrait of a husband and wife; Still life with eggs, game and bronzeware from the house of Julia Felix (all paintings from Pompeii and Herculaneum)</h2> <p>On the morning of August 24, AD79, Vesuvius erupted and buried the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum in ash, pumice and volcanic mud. It was not until the 18th century that the sites began to be excavated - a process that continues, meaning the staggeringly wellpreserved towns have many secrets yet to impart. </p> <p>It is the wall paintings from Pompeii - the colours often still pristine and vigorous - that are particularly stunning. A double portrait of a husband and wife is so fresh it could be a painting of your neighbours; a still life has the calmness of composition one might associate with Chardin; on a striking scarlet trompe l'oeil architectural backdrop, Dionysus lies in the lap of Ariadne. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (2nd century) - Apollo Belvedere </h2> <p>Long seen as the epitome of the cool, balanced and graceful in Greek art, this sculpture was hugely influential in the Renaissance, inspiring, for instance, D\u00fcrer's Adam in his famous engraving of the Fall of Man. The bronze original, dating back to the fourth century BC, is lost; what survives is a Roman copy in marble. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (161-180) - Equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius </h2> <p>The only surviving bronze equestrian statue from antiquity, it was preserved in the Middle Ages because it was thought to depict the first Christian emperor, Constantine. Michelangelo made it the centrepiece of his Campidoglio, the square atop the Capitoline Hill in Rome. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Roman (c313) - Fragments of the Colossus of Constantine </h2> <p>The most famous giant sculptures of antiquity, such as Pheidias's gold and ivory statue of Athena for the Parthenon, are lost. But the fragments of Constantine's statue - his foot the size of a pony, his hand taller than a child - give an idea of these awe-inspiring creations. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Nagasawa Rosetsu - Shoki the Demon Queller and Toad (c1787)</h2> <p>Toad is one of the world's most life-like animal paintings; the very essence of the creature seems to have been captured in a few skilful washes of ink. It was part of a scroll Rosetsu made on a long visit to Kii province and took no more than a few minutes to execute. <strong>(JL)</strong></p> <h2>Mark Rothko -Self-Portrait (1936), Seagram Restaurant, Murals (1959), Rothko Chapel (paintings produced 1964-1967)</h2> <p>There are few more extreme and convincing manifestations of the power of painting than Rothko's dark works. Though capable of the brightest and most scintillating colour, in the paintings he created as murals for a restaurant and later a non-denominational chapel he dives into the depths of night. The wine-dark sea of Homer, the blood-red vintage of Bacchus, bleed in his wide paintings for the Seagram restaurant with their numinous floating frames. Rothko visited Italy while planning them, was impressed by the blank windows of Michelangelo's Laurentian Library and the deep red paintings of Pompeii, but what they really resemble in their combination of painterly<br>grandeur and raw reality is the art of Caravaggio. <strong>(Jonathan Jones)</strong></p> <h2>Henri Rousseau - War (1894), The Snake Charmer (1907)</h2> <p>Just because Henri Rousseau was an untrained artist does not mean he lacks finesse. In his haunting scene The Snake Charmer, this customs official whose \"naive\" style both fascinated and entertained the Paris avant-garde displays a subtle sense of atmosphere as he sets a dark figure in a dark jungle. He is a master of light and an unabashed visionary, who in War displays pale bodes on a nightmare battlefield. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Peter Paul Rubens - The Descent from the Cross (1611-1614), The Lion Hunt (c1621), Susanna Fourment (c1622-1625), The Allegory of Peace (1629-1630), Helena Fourment in a Fur Wrap (c1630s), Landscape with a Rainbow (c1635-1638), The Horrors of War (1637-1638)</h2> <p>It was William Blake who said that energy is eternal delight; and it is Rubens who proves it. His art is all tumultuous sweeping vortexes of curving, rearing motion, screaming warriors, bloody hunts, thumping dances, blinding revelations. Even when he includes a still life in a mythological scene, no doubt to represent abundance, it seems to move as the light dances on the wet skin of a grape.</p> <p>Rubens's lack of stillness makes it surprisingly hard to isolate a handful of masterpieces from his creative flow: although this courtly, urbane 17th century friend of monarchs might seem the very opposite of a modern artist, the meaning of his art lies not in its images but in the texture of his material - glorious paint - and his process of working it. </p> <p>Rubens is almost an abstract painter - a possibility he makes quite explicit in his immense Lion Hunt, in which daunting quantities of paint are expended and blood unleashed in a scene that's not really about anything. It is not a battle scene, or a mythological story, and the hunt is pure fantasy. It is painting pleasing itself, with visceral abandon. And yet he is not abstract, of course. He is a history painter of great moral dignity. Rubens's native city, Antwerp, suffered terribly in the wars between Spain and the Netherlands, and a horror of war is one of the most consistent personal feelings in his art. His Allegory of Peace is a deeply arresting picture, with its little girl looking out of the canvas as the savage hand of Mars is stayed. In the later, fearsome Horrors of War, the nightmare is out of control and a peasant tries to protect her child in a sudden flash of unprocessed reality; in the distance the countryside is burning.</p> <p>He is, after all, a very simple man. He fears war, takes deep pleasure in his houses and lands: his great Rainbow Landscape, with its sense of order in the flux of nature, is set on his own rural estate. His portrait of his wife Helena Fourment is disarming in its intimate warmth; his picture of her sister Susannah in a straw hat set standards of style and beauty that would still be emulated in the age of Renoir. Yet it is Rubens's picturing of the cosmos that is most impressive. His art anticipates modern physics in its intimation of a nature that is endlessly changing, expanding, apparently chaotic in its energy - and yet hangs together. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Andrei Rublev - The Saviour (early 15th century)</h2> <p>The vast face of Christ peers as if from behind a door in this painting whose fleshy realism - there are subtle shadows on the Saviour's throat, he stands turning towards you - make this icon painter Russia's answer to the artists of the Italian Renaissance. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Ed Ruscha - Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass (1968), Twenty-six Gasoline Stations (1963), Every Building on the Sunset Strip (1966)</h2> <p>West-coast artist Ed Ruscha is famed for his restrained version of Pop art in which the emblems of daily life are elevated on canvas. In the 1960s he embarked on a series of photographic books recording the environs of Los Angeles. From the blue azure rectangles of nine empty swimming pools to the gasoline stations hugging the freeway, he photographed the backdrops against which human drama is played out. <strong>(JL)</strong></p> <h2>Robert Ryman - Surface Veil (1971)</h2> <p>Ryman claimed \"it was never my intention to make white paintings\"; which is odd given that he produced little else. It's all about the purging of illusion and outside reference. The enigmatic title is just the brand of fibreglass it was painted on. <strong>(Alfred Hickling)</strong></p>",
  "<p>Cancel every school trip; abandon every civics class; relocate every citizenship ceremony: anyone interested in the history and meaning of British liberties needs to head to the British Library in London. For the first time, our constitution is on show. </p> <p>It was the late Lord Scarman who once suggested that the British constitution was not so much \"unwritten\", but just \"difficult to find\". While Americans queue round the block of the National Archives building in Washington to pay homage to the Declaration of Independence, the diffusion of Britain's constitutional record has systematically neutered any popular enthusiasm for this past. It is as if, down the generations, Britain's rulers have never dared to let daylight in upon the magic of their governance.</p> <p>Now, the neon lights are well and truly on. Beginning with the Magna Carta of 1215 and taking in the death warrant of Charles I, the 1832 Reform Act, the Holloway prison diary of suffragette Olive Wharry, and concluding with the Beveridge Report and the Human Rights Act, this is the definitive story of British liberty told through the printed page. And what these dry parliamentary acts, Hogarth prints and raucous election leaflets all point to is just how hard-fought these rights have proved. </p> <p>In contrast to Kenneth Baker's planned \"museum of Britishness\", this is not a Whiggish tale of simple, glorious progress. What the minute-books of the outlawed Corresponding Societies of the 1790s, the photo of the Chartists' 1848 rally on Kennington Common, and the Race Relations Act highlight is the ongoing struggle which enmeshes this history. Liberty and democracy were never handed over on a plate: they were taken by the British people from under the cosh of the policeman's truncheon and the bench of \"special juries\". </p> <p>As historian and co-curator Linda Colley points out, Britain - the so-called \"mother of parliaments\" - was in fact remarkably backward when it came to giving people the vote. \"After 1850, the UK increasingly lagged behind other parts of Europe, the US, and even some of its own colonial dominions in the access it afforded to the franchise,\" she writes in an accompanying essay. \"Despite Reform Acts in 1867 and 1884, the UK electorate at the start of the 20th century was one of the narrowest in Europe.\" Such historical clarity is a useful corrective to our self-congratulatory rhetoric of timeless British freedom. </p> <p>Indeed, the chauvinism of Gordon Brown finds no echo in this exhibition. What the copies of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's will, the US Declaration of Independence, and an excellent display of Thomas Paine's Rights of Man all point to is the foreign influence on supposedly indigenous, British notions of freedom. True, many theories of democracy and toleration originated here, but then had to be re-imported back to us from William Penn's Pennsylvania or the French national assembly. The much vaunted \"golden thread\" of British liberty is clearly best approached as an international, Enlightenment phenomenon. </p> <p>Yet what is particular to these islands is an abiding belief in the rule of law. Sir Edward Coke, the jurist and MP who caused Charles I so much trouble, put it best when he described Magna Carta as \"such a fellow, that he will have no sovereign\". It is this sense of the righteousness of the law in protecting personal freedom from arbitrary governance (often far more important a liberty than the vote) which has for centuries provided such a powerful vision of the British birthright - and was so recently on display in the House of Lords debate over 42 days detention. The great virtue of Taking Libeties is to make flesh these rather ethereal notions with copies of the Habeas Corpus acts, the 1689 Bill of Rights, as well as suffragette posters of the 1900s all demanding freedom as an uniquely English, then British, attribute. </p> <p>The exhibition also demands we take part in the process. Today, no museum can afford not to be interactive and, in a clever swipe at the surveillance society, as visitors enter the exhibition they are allocated an electronic tag that then allows them to vote at touch screens on issues raised by the historical documents: does CCTV keep us safe? Do we agree with 42 days detention? Should the NHS treat people who are irresponsible about their health? At the exit, answers are collated on a constantly updated computer screen to reveal a rolling response to modern-day views of liberty. Instantly, the grand narrative of the Petition of Right and Hobbes' Leviathan are made powerfully, if parochially, intelligible. In the shadow of the past, our current battle for rights - to smoke in public places, to drive fast, to refuse to give our DNA - seem both desperately trivial and yet, such is the reach of the modern state, a pathetic fag-end to the freedoms we once enjoyed. </p> <p>One of the loftier questions posed is whether there should be an English parliament. The documents emphasise the clear disparities between what has historically constituted English and British rights: at one end of the display is the 1706 Articles of Union and a garish notebook detailing various designs for the new Union flag, and at the other the Laws of Hywel Dda (Wales's answer to Magna Carta) as well as the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, in which the Scottish signatories declared they would never \"on any conditions be brought under English rule\". More controversially, the curators have also showcased the 1916 Sinn Fein Rebellion Handbook. In the month when the women of Northern Ireland were once again denied the same abortion rights as those on the mainland, the documents highlight that long tradition of strange things happening to British liberty as it crosses the Irish Sea. </p> <p>As such, the exhibition hints at the recurrent historical tension between the British system of liberties and its imperial implementation. Despite our slave-trading industry, in 1701 Lord Chief Justice Holt could rule that \"as soon as a Negro comes into England, he becomes free: one may be a villein in England, but not a slave\". This was the language of free-born Englishmen, but it belied our arbitrary practices abroad. Indeed, the actions of officials and soldiers in the British empire often served as warning of the perils of lost liberty. According to Colley, \"One of the persistent criticisms levelled against the empire by reformers and jurists was that such abuses overseas might in due course threaten and infect the quality of liberties at home.\" In ascending order, what happened in a colony today may be done in Ireland tomorrow and England hereafter. </p> <p>Beyond the legal perimeters of trial and detention, Taking Liberties tackles head on Isaiah Berlin's two concepts of liberty: the \"negative liberty\" of freedom from interference (celebrated in a copy of JS Mill's On Liberty), as well as the \"positive liberty\" to achieve human potential. So, the section on \"Freedom from Want\" looks at the growth of welfare and state support from the friendly societies of the 1800s via the People's Budget up to the founding of the NHS in 1948. </p> <p>In doing so, the exhibition opens itself up to a Tory critique. Arguably, it was the post-war welfare state that killed off much of that civil society - the dense, social fabric of clubs, associations, and charities - that constituted an essential element of British freedom, in contrast to Continental centralism. On one reading, the great clunking fist of Whitehall smothered the little platoons of British self-help. Conservatives might also detect a subtly anti-royal sensibility with little treatment of the 20th-century monarchy in preserving the constitutional settlement. Disappointingly, the exhibition also dodges today's debates over cultural rights and freedom of speech. There is a scholarly treatment of John Milton's Areopagitica, but nothing on The Satanic Verses. </p> <p>Instead, the show culminates with an advert from Charter 88 and, with it, an implicit call to arms. British subjects have been very effective over the past 800 years at reining in the power of monarchs. But, in the process, we have taken our eye off parliament. The Levellers of the English civil war were amongst the first to point out that politicians were as dangerous as princes when it came to attacking personal freedom. And now we have ended up with monstrously unchecked governments able to make war and law with all the temerity of an elective dictatorship. The Human Rights Act was one attempt to curb this executive excess, but the political agenda behind these myriad documents and complex charters is to make the case for a modern, written constitution and bill of rights. </p> <p>But that is not what I took away from Taking Liberties. Instead, the exhibition only served to affirm the fascinating complexity surrounding the British story of liberty and the redundancy of trying to reduce it to a single document. Quite simply, the history is too rich.</p>",
  "<p>\"Human nature often dictates the need to find someone or something to blame.\" Thus spake Daniel Levy in his letter to the Corinthians ... I do beg your pardon, in his letter to Spurs fans at the weekend. Whether or not you nurse minuscule differences of opinion with Mr Levy over his many stratagems and sermons, you must agree that this missive was a classic of the open letter genre.</p> <p>For too long this much underrated literary device has been the preserve of self-effacing journalists whose weakness for filling space in newspapers with portentous missives beginning \"Dear George Bush\" or \"An open letter to Ben Bernanke\" is a cause for mirth for the rest of us. What a pleasure, then, to find the open letter device increasingly resorted to by football club chairmen who have made monumental arses of themselves, usually via the old \"director of football\" banana skin.</p> <p>October is not yet out and already we have seen open letters deployed by the Newcastle chairman, Mike Ashley, whose director of football is the much-loved Dennis Wise and whose manager is the heavily charm-schooled Joe Kinnear. For all that he has a talent for pulling in the big hitters, Mr Ashley was last month moved to announce that he loved the club so much that he was going to sell it, at least at such time as he could be sure of making a profit, a date we might - in light of recent events in the global financial markets - place around 2019. And on Saturday it was Mr Levy's turn to unleash his open letter, as the Spurs chairman attempted to draw a line under recent and indeed not so recent disappointments for the club, by appealing to fans direct.</p> <p>We have yet to hear from West Ham's chairman, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, who would complete our trifecta of chairmen whose employment of a director of football locks them into the inevitability of having to pen an \"open letter\" down the line, typically after the departure of a manager. Like his club's most newshounded supporter, my Guardian colleague Russell Brand, Mr Gudmundsson seems content to remain tight-lipped at present, despite Alan Curbishley having left Upton Park last month. Understandable, perhaps, given that Mr Gudmundsson has been deposed as chairman of an Icelandic bank and threatened with anti-terror legislation by Gordon Brown. (Mr Brown has moved on to branding Mr Brand a terror, but we mustn't digress.)</p> <p>What the open letter effectively does is allow the writers to nurse the illusion of communicating directly with an audience they have either lost or whose secretary's secretary never even took their calls. Yet just as there is a certain absurdity to journalists filling their spaces with open letters to the United States president, or the chairman of the Federal Reserve, so it is to be hoped that, the minute football chairmen have to resort to penning open letters to fans, they realise it is they themselves who have terminally lost the audience. There may be better results around the corner, there may even be a little light silverware in the future, but they will never fully recover and the minute things go even slightly wrong again they will once again be the target of their fans' ire.</p> <p>In his open letter, Mr Levy did make rather weaselly reference to his postbag. \"I do appreciate the time people take to write to me,\" he claimed, \"and when the emails or letters are constructive and not abusive, I can assure you that I read as many as I can. And I do take notice of your views.\"</p> <p>Well, you don't, old chap. At least not inside of several years. But what's the point in getting worked up, when Mr Levy has ushered in a new era where everything you thought you knew was right, and directors of football will have to retrain in other profoundly destabilising cultural roles - as investment bankers, possibly, or as judgment-challenged radio producers?</p> <p>All of which brings us back to Russell, whose suspension yesterday by the BBC leaves his column - in this very space on Saturday - his only outlet. It is very much to be hoped that he might fall back upon the open letter format, perhaps beginning his column \"Dear Andrew Sachs\" or \"Dear Andrews Sachs's granddaughter\" or indeed \"Dear Paul Dacre\".</p> <p>Come to that, as a sublimely gifted ironist, Russell may instead see the comedic potential in addressing an open letter to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, advising him that he has lost a significant part of his audience and must stop acting like such an arrogant arse at once.</p>",
  "<p>If I made use of the telephone system by repeatedly sending messages that were grossly offensive, of an indecent, obscene and menacing character for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to Andrew Sachs and/or his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, then I would be guilty of an offence under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003; I would be liable to imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.</p> <p>However, if I sent the offensive messages in the course of providing a programme service within the meaning of the Broadcasting Act 1990 then I would not (see tinyurl.com/5e793n).

  "<p>Ice may be a nuisance underfoot or on your windscreen, but in the air it can be lethal. The most common cause of icing on aircraft is flying through a cloud containing supercooled water droplets. These are already below freezing point, but have not frozen. Contact with the metal surface of the plane turns the droplets into ice which sticks to the aircraft, and which can build up quickly.</p> <p>Even a thin layer of ice on a wing can spoil its aerodynamics, increasing the drag and reducing the lift. Even more sinister is when ice forms on control surfaces and cables: the first a pilot may know about it is when the aircraft stops responding to the controls. Instrument icing presents a more subtle risk, when external sensors get covered in ice, so speedometers and altimeters give inaccurate readings.</p> <p>Airliners have both anti-icing systems to prevent ice from forming, and de-icing systems to remove any ice that does form. Some use electrical heating, others take hot air from the aircraft's engines.</p> <p>A crash-landing at Heathrow earlier this year was caused by ice particles in the fuel. Aviation fuel can contain a small amount of water, and in this case the water froze, resulting in a build-up of ice which seems to have blocked the fuel feed system. This was extremely unusual, caused by the combination of very low temperatures (it was -76C between Scandinavia and the Urals during the flight) and a low rate of fuel feed.</p>",
  "<p>Significant stock market falls in the past two months mean that 2 million endowment and pension fund customers of Standard Life face smaller payouts and higher penalties if they cash their policies in early. </p> <p>A 37% fall in the FTSE 100 since August has forced Standard Life to increase charges and extend the range of products being hit by the penalty charges. </p> <p>The insurer is raising the exit penalty on one of its pension funds to 30%, while mortgage endowment customers face new exit charges.</p> <p>The decision by Standard Life follows steps by other insurers to penalise customers who cash in policies early.

In its interim figures in August, it boasted that the company was \"resilient to market falls\".</p> <p>Concerns have resurfaced about the health of the insurance industry following the turmoil in the banking sector, where HBOS, Lloyds, TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland are being bailed out by the taxpayer.

  "<p>We've got so used to the idea, it's easy to discount it. But if Barack Obama is elected US president on Tuesday, the symbolic impact at least can hardly be overestimated. Most obvious is the racial dimension. The election of an African-American to the most powerful job in the world by a society built on slavery, discrimination and ethnic cleansing cannot but have far-reaching cultural repercussions, both in America and across the globe. Throughout the US, it will surely be a moment of catharsis in a country barely a generation away from the struggle over segregation and civil rights. </p> <p>Then there will be profound national and global relief at the end of the eight-year reign of the Bushite Republicans, with their wars of bloody conquest, kidnapping and torture, and reckless featherbedding of the corporate oligarchy at the expense of ordinary Americans. This week's attack on yet another sovereign state, Syria, is a reminder, if any were needed, of the swaggering militarism which has marked the Bush-Cheney regime. </p> <p>Add to that the charismatic appeal of a Kennedy-style liberal, and the ingredients for an outpouring of popular enthusiasm at home and an extended political honeymoon abroad are all in place. In the wake of seven disastrous years of the war on terror, the US political system will be seen to have renewed itself and earned a generous measure of international goodwill towards the latest holder of that bogus, unelected title, \"leader of the free world\".</p> <p>If, on the other hand, John McCain were to confound weeks of opinion polls and win the day, the backlash would surely be harsh. Against a background of intense Republican unpopularity, economic crisis and apparently impregnable polling leads, such a victory would be widely seen as the product of shameless racism - and the election as rigged and stolen. In the US, anger could be expected to turn to rioting. Across the rest of the world, America's popularity and moral standing - already at a historic low - would sink to unprecedented depths. No wonder such a large part of the American establishment is rooting for an Obama win.</p> <p>No politician, least of all one tied up by the constraints of the corporate-funded US presidential system, can hope to meet the kind of expectations that have been aroused among the Illinois senator's armies of enthusiasts, even if bolstered by a clean Democratic sweep in Congress. Political momentum can be sustained in the short term by emblematic decisions, such as the closure of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay internment camp and a start to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. But it is the economic crisis that has powered Obama's campaign to this point, and despite a more populist agenda than Bill Clinton - including tax rises for those earning more than $250,000, Gordon Brown please note - the sort of measures needed to tackle ballooning unemployment, bankruptcies and repossessions are simply not on the table.</p> <p>This is a country, after all, where real incomes for low and middle income earners have already been stagnating for years, 45 million people have no health insurance, black people make up nearly 40% of its world-beating 2.3 million prison population - and which, on the brink of a slump, is stuffing the pockets of bankers with $700bn without serious public controls. Obama's policy programme, as far as it goes, hardly begins to match the scale of the challenge, but already he is talking about cutting back planned programmes to pay for the crisis and the cost of the Iraq war.</p> <p>The same goes for US foreign policy. After two terms of unilateralism and aggression, Obama's conciliatory tone, opposition to the Iraq war, support for dialogue with Iran, and apparent preference for \"soft power\" naturally seem like manna from heaven in the rest of the world. But look at the small print and continuity, rather than change, appears to be the order of the day. In Iraq, his proposal to withdraw combat troops in 16 months while maintaining bases and \"counter-terror\" forces is increasingly similar to Bush and McCain's own policy, as are his plans to escalate the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan as the \"central front in the war on terror\", and his hawkish line on conflicts from Colombia to Georgia. </p> <p>So far there's no prospect of any fundamental shift in approach, as underlined by the number of Obama's advisers drafted in from the Clinton era. What he appears to be offering instead is some kind of imperialism with a human face - as he himself says, he wants a return to the \"realistic policy\" of George Bush senior, JFK, and \"in some ways, Ronald Reagan\". Some Obama supporters believe much of this is election positioning, and there have been quiet assurances to sympathisers around the world that plenty will be up for discussion in the aftermath of victory.</p> <p>Of course, whoever the president, the US will remain a global colossus, with a military presence in 130 of the world's 195 countries. But it is also a power in unmistakable relative decline and an Obama presidency offers the US a breathing space to re-order its relations with the rest of the world accordingly. The benefit of the doubt that will be given to Obama in the early period of a new administration - in Europe that's likely to stretch to defence of the indefensible, as in the Clinton years - potentially gives the US extra room for manoeuvre. Economic failure may yet force military cutbacks, despite Obama's pledge to expand the armed forces. But, as in the domestic arena, if expectations of change are dashed, the reaction may end up being all the sharper.</p> <p>What seems certain is that Obama's election will be a catalyst that creates political opportunities both at home and abroad. The Obama campaign grew out of popular opposition to the Iraq war and its success has been based on the mobilisation of supporters who will certainly want to go further and faster than their candidate. Economic conditions are also likely to demand a more decisive response. And even if conditions are very different from those which led to the New Deal of the 1930s - not least the lack of a powerful labour movement - Obama could yet, like Roosevelt, be propelled by events to adopt more radical positions. In any case, if Obama is to begin to fulfil the confidence invested in him, hope will not be enough - those who want real change will have to fight for it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><br>In 1950, when the mathematician Alan Turing set out to tackle the question \"Can machines think?\" the intellectual litmus paper he settled on was conversation. The Turing test - in which an AI program attempts to fool judges into believing they are conversing with a human - has never been passed, though two weeks ago, a program named Elbot came close.</p> <p>The Turing test has validated communication as a convenient signifier for machine intelligence. Which is perhaps why chat between computer-controlled enemies has become such a familiar element of modern videogames. The groundbreaking 2005 shooter F.E.A.R was one of the first, allowing AI characters to shout out your position. Of course, providing a series of stock phrases triggered by specific game events isn't exactly cutting-edge stuff, but - as has always been the case with videogame AI - the illusion is everything. This is why the programmer Will Wright invented a whole gibberish language - Simlish - for his Sims games: he wanted the impression of communication without the computational nightmare of recording thousands of phrases. </p> <p>Things are advancing: enemy soldiers are becoming proactive, formulating and verbalising simple strategies. In Ubisoft's Far Cry 2, you can hear your opponents helping each other. As the game's technology director Dominic Guay explains: \"One AI can tell two others to flank the player while a third rushes him and the first takes care of suppression fire.\"</p> <p>This sort of chatter increases the sense of immersion - and it also provides clues about enemy operations. Is that shrub you've just dived behind providing sufficient cover? If your enemies are yelling \"I've lost him!\", the chances are it is. </p> <p>Jeff Orkin, the programmer behind the AI in F.E.A.R and an AI researcher at MIT, says communication and verbalisation must go further. \"We want enemies that truly live in persistent, open-ended worlds, and are working towards longer-term plans such as building defences, disseminating information and sabotaging the player's efforts.\"</p> <p>Stumbling into a group of enemies as they bicker over strategies for your demise is going to be a key pleasure of next-generation shoot-'em-ups. Verbal communication between the player and AI characters is another inevitable progression. In EndWar, Ubisoft allows the player to control units using voice commands delivered via a microphone. This hints toward a future in which the player will chat with AI allies and taunt enemies. Turing would be impressed.</p> <p>Get all the latest videogames news and gossip straight from our trio of bloggers <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog\">theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog</a></p>"
