  "<p>I head up RMJM, one of the world's biggest architecture firms. I'm not an architect, but I sure do look like one. I'm a white man approaching middle age and I've had a comfortable upbringing. Our industry, sadly, does not accurately reflect society in Britain today. It's not deliberate, but the profession is not inclusive - to be perfectly blunt, it's reminiscent of an exclusive old boys' club.</p> <p>RMJM employs more than 1,200 architects. We keep close tabs on talent coming through and I have to say there's a lot of sameness about the place. The built environment is at risk of becoming a very boring place where one design is much like another because one architect is much like another.</p> <p>Let me say from the outset we are not talking about the profession being inherently racist. That's not the case. The fact is it's relatively expensive to study architecture, making it more likely that students will come from professional family backgrounds. This, in turn means, there are a lack of non-white role models coming through the system.</p> <p>People tend to get an aspirational boost when they see someone else from their background who has already made it, so to speak. There are, of course, other society factors too that all amount to what is essentially a poverty of opportunity. There are other professions that are probably in the same situation, but that's not an excuse to not do something about it. </p> <p>We need to change: involve people in the design process through community consultation; encourage young people from across the spectrum to take an interest in architecture and possibly make a career of it; educate qualified architects about the world they live in and broaden their horizons at every opportunity.</p> <p>In practice at RMJM, this translates to five-day volunteering programmes for all our architects to head out into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities\">communities</a> to assist in projects and spread the word about the profession. </p> <p>We have employed a dedicated project manager to work with the <a href=\"http://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/content/view/61/101/\">Stephen Lawrence Trust</a> and we will be hosting a series of workshops in Britain's inner cities designed to attract young people and encourage them to explore their creativity. We'll also be partnering local colleges and community groups to maximise impact.</p> <p>And we will identify six talented young people to attend an eight-week introductory course at the prestigious Harvard University graduate school of design in the US, and then work with them as mentors through their university studies and employment as architects.</p> <p>It's not going to change things overnight, but it's a start. One, mind you, that has been industry-led and for a very good reason. The startling truth is we're facing a very real shortage of designers and, although there is a downturn in the construction industry in the UK at the moment, there are huge opportunities around the world and those aren't going to go away.</p> <p>A report from the OECD last year said infrastructure spending needed to be \u00a353,0000bn worldwide between now and 2030 as governments in developed countries perform much-needed upgrades to transport systems, and emerging markets industrialise.</p> <p>Our industry is in trouble. The supply chain for our most important resource - people - is in poor health. There are not enough people coming through, and what's coming through is mostly the same. It's not a good position to be in, 22 years out from 2030.</p> <p>We need to reach out today to kids from all backgrounds interested in becoming architects. We need new faces, new ideas, and new ways of looking at the world. The same old, same old is boring and come 2030, if not already, boring design will not close the deals on big projects. </p> <p>It takes seven years to train an architect - waiting another 10 years to take action is not an option. That's the business case for diversity. There are, of course, more compelling reasons for change.</p> <p>Architecture is often considered to be a social science, it has to do with people. If sections of society are excluded from architecture then we cannot hope to address their needs. One of the most basic human needs is shelter and without that people cannot possibly flourish and achieve their best. This underpins the importance of the built environment in supporting individuals and society.</p> <p>We need to incorporate a range of different perspectives and experiences in our masterplans and designs. How can people who've never lived in a troubled inner city area hope to regenerate it? It's easy, you employ architects who grew up in that environment, but the problem is there are hardly any. We need to break this paradigm of exclusion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Peter Morrison is the chief executive of UK-based RMJM Architects, one of the world's biggest design firms. The firm is working with the Stephen Lawrence Centre to promote architecture as a realistic career goal for young people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. RMJM-funded initiatives worth more than \u00a31m will be officially announced at the annual Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture to be delivered by designer Wayne Hemingway in London tonight</p>",
  "<p>Bernard Haitink's second Chicago Symphony Prom consisted of Mozart's C minor Piano Concerto, K491, and Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony. This is the third time Haitink has conducted K491 in London in as many months - it seems to hold a symbolic significance for its soloists. Alfred Brendel bade farewell to the LSO by playing it twice during Haitink's Barbican series last June; the Proms performance, meanwhile, marked the return of Murray Perahia to the Albert Hall after a 20-year absence.</p> <p>Perahia's lyrical yet declamatory style makes him the ideal interpreter of this work, with its operatic tensions and intimations of tragedy. The nervous energy he brought to the opening allegro and to the uneasy finale was balanced by a slow movement that was perfect in its formal control and piercing sadness. Haitink probed its emotional ambiguities with formidable intelligence; further layers of tension were added by the disparity between the elegance of the strings and the bitter sound of the woodwind.</p> <p>Fiercely conducted, but played with less than this orchestra's usual assurance, the Shostakovich proved more equivocal. Withdrawn for fear of offending Stalin, the symphony is at once enormous and almost suicidally tragic. Haitink, extraordinarily, played down its debt to Mahler in a flattening performance that plumbed the outer limits of despair. Yet the woodwind sometimes played with a heavy vibrato, when bleached tonelessness is what is required. And the brass were crude throughout - not entirely inappropriate in context, but you would not want to hear a brass section play like this all the time.</p>",
  "<p>Failing NHS hospitals are to be saved from bankruptcy under plans set out by the government yesterday to protect patients from the consequences of financial meltdown.</p> <p>A \"failure regime\" for the NHS in England was published for consultation by the Department of Health after years of wrangling in Whitehall about the implications for independent foundation hospitals, which were supposed to be free to sink or swim in a competitive NHS market.</p> <p>Ben Bradshaw, the health minister, said in June that failing hospitals might be put under private-sector management in a last-ditch attempt to improve services to patients.</p> <p>But the department acknowledged yesterday that some trusts may not be capable of rescue. It said: \"An additional process will be required, very occasionally, where an organisation is no longer failing, but where it has become impossible to turn around and it has actually failed.\" This might occur if healthcare regulators withdrew a hospital's licence to treat patients on safety grounds, or if a trust reached the verge of bankruptcy because it could not compete in an area of surplus healthcare capacity.</p> <p>Under the proposals, David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, would gain authority to declare an NHS hospital to be \"unsustainable\". He would appoint a \"special administrator\" to take over the trust and work out how to maintain essential services. The administrator would have a duty to put the interests of patients before the claims of creditors.</p> <p>Foundation hospitals, which have independence from Whitehall control and ownership of the assets they inherited from the NHS, were concerned that the failure regime might give Nicholson power to renationalise their assets.</p> <p>Ministers have ruled that William Moyes, chairman of Monitor, the foundations' regulator, should have the authority to decide when a trust is in such dire straits that it should be stripped of its independent status. Only then could Nicholson send in a special administrator.</p> <p>Ministers want the failure regime to be introduced in April. They intend to publish a list of hospitals falling below minimum standards in the autumn. </p> <p>Nicholson said: \"The majority of hospitals and trusts are performing well, providing high quality services to patients and managing resources effectively. However, in the rare cases where a challenged trust fails to turn itself around, it is important that there are clear processes set out to ensure that services for patients continue to be provided.\"</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said: \"Assets required for the maintenance of NHS services should continue to be available under any insolvency regime ... But that doesn't mean the government should take all the risk. Under these proposals the Treasury would begin to exert a new level of control over foundation trusts.\"</p>",
  "<p>Despite the dismal summer weather, these are happy days for the government's weather forecasters. The Meteorological Office last week published annual accounts showing profits of \u00a314m for 2007-08, up 56% on the previous year's. As a government-owned \"trading fund\", it paid a dividend of \u00a311m to the Treasury. </p> <p>But, as usual with the government's quasi-commercial information activities, that's not the whole story. Of the organisation's turnover of \u00a3177m, only \u00a327m came from the commercial world. Most of the rest came from public bodies - that is, taxpayers' money swirling around between different official bodies. The Free Our Data campaign has long argued that sustaining this money-go-round carries a cost to the knowledge economy. But is it really blocking anyone? Is there really a gap in the market for private weather forecasters who can't afford to spend tens of millions of pounds on the latest IBM supercomputing kit, as the Met Office has just done?</p> <p>Yes, says veteran meteorologist Richard Pettifer, general secretary of the Association of Private Meteorological Services. The key is free data. In a recent paper in the Royal Meteorological Society's journal Meteorological Applications, Pettifer says that the market in national weather services in Europe is close to saturation - but that there is a huge potential in the \"two-penny market\" for cheap local forecasts. To provide such forecasts, suppliers must \"be flexible, able to respond quickly to new customer requirements and, above all, have low overheads and fixed costs\".</p> <p>These characteristics are the antithesis of national organisations. Although the Met Office is better than some of its counterparts at making data available, the costs and complexities of licensing data stunt growth. \"The data are subject to wholesale pricing that is too high and in some cases there is a failure to supply the data.\" The solution? European law on public sector information should close what he calls the \"loopholes\" that let government agencies recover unspecified costs through sales.</p> <p>The Met Office's future, along with that of other information businesses operating as trading funds, is under examination by the government's Shareholder Executive. In its annual report this week, the executive says the study will \"examine the impact any changes to the current pricing, access and licensing regimes for the information the funds hold or create would have on the trading funds' business models\". The study will also distinguish more clearly what information is required by government for public policy. This is the information that the Free Our Data campaign argues should be made available for re-use by all comers. The study is due to report by Budget 2009, next spring.</p> <p>Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog <a href=\"http://freeourdata.org.uk/blog\">freeourdata.org.uk/blog</a></p>",
  "<p>He's the 22-year-old blond bombshell son of the French president, whose own political career has turned him into a celebrity. But last night Jean Sarkozy married his childhood sweetheart, a Jewish retailing heiress, in a move that was more than just the latest romantic chapter in the Sarkozy family fairytale. It has also reignited a scathing row over the dark issue of antisemitism in France.</p> <p>The young Sarkozy - who is still a law student but holds a key position in local politics in his father's former fiefdom, the rich Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine - was reportedly married in a civil service so private that the guests were only notified by text message. His bride, Jessica Sibaoun-Darty, is an heiress to the electrical goods company Darty - a kind of French Argos. They met as high school students growing up in affluent, showbiz Neuilly, and when they got engaged this summer they were quickly feted as France's youngest power couple.</p> <p>But soon there was a rumour that Jean Sarkozy, a Catholic, had travelled to Israel for religious instruction and was planning to convert to Judaism before marrying. His family has its own Jewish connections: Nicolas Sarkozy's grandfather was a Jewish doctor born in the Greek city of Salonica, now known as Thessaloniki. </p> <p>After the engagement Maurice Sinet, a veteran cartoonist for the irreverent and deliberately provocative satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, wrote an article under his pen-name Sin\u00e9, saying Sarkozy Jr \"has just said he intends to convert to Judaism before marrying his fianc\u00e9e, who is Jewish, and the heiress to the founders of Darty. He'll go far, that kid.\"</p> <p>Sin\u00e9 was sacked by the magazine's editor, who said his remarks \"could be interpreted as drawing a link between conversion to Judaism and social success\", rehashing the old stereotype linking Jews and money. Last month antisemitic graffiti against Jean Sarkozy appeared on walls in Neuilly, reading: \"Sarkozy, Jewish thieves\", and police arrested a suspect. </p> <p>Sin\u00e9, who denied claims of antisemitism and has lodged a legal complaint, saying death threats had been made against him, launched his own magazine yesterday in which he said he would defend freedom of speech. The International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism has brought a court case against him for incitement to racial hatred, citing the Jean Sarkozy article and another about Muslim women who wear headscarves. </p> <p>The row has fed the debate about antisemitism in France, which has Europe's largest Jewish population and where the spectre remains of historic cases of antisemitism and the deportation of Jews during the second world war. </p> <p>Twenty leading writers and politicians, including the mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, wrote an open letter to Le Monde last month saying Sin\u00e9 had \"crossed the line between humorous insult and hateful caricature\" and was rightly sacked. </p> <p>Jean Sarkozy, a councillor and head of the centre-right local council bloc in the wealthy Hauts-de-Seine district of western Paris, told L'Optimum magazine: \"The rumour of conversion is false. And when I read antisemitic remarks on blogs, I'm very shocked; I ask myself where it all comes from and why I'm singled out for such treatment. People seize on a rumour to ask me about possible choices that have nothing to do with my political work.\" </p> <p>The young Sarkozy is trying to shed his image as \"Monsieur Son Of\". But interest in him is outstripping the public appetite for his stepmother, the ex-model and singer Carla Bruni. She appeared on a popular chatshow last weekend but won lower audience ratings than the former first lady Bernadette Chirac did before her.</p>",
  "<p>Radio 4 went into subatomic overdrive yesterday, devoting nine programmes to a Cern theme, beginning with live reports on <strong>Today</strong> from Andrew Marr inside the control centre in Geneva. </p> <p>\"Is it like James Bond, with hundreds of people running round while a big voice counts down?\" asked Evan Davis. \"It's like a big school hall,\" Marr replied, rather deflatingly. He described the 20,000 PC processors that surrounded him, but the noisy air-conditioning preventing them all from overheating somewhat drowned him out.</p> <p>At 8.30am, nothing happened. Marr bravely chatted on, cutting off mid-sentence to yell: \"It's happened! A historic day for world science!\" </p> <p>It hadn't, though, it had been a false start, so we got several more minutes of Marr filling airtime in progressively less scientific, more desperate fashion - \"This was never, ever a sure thing. This is a very hard thing to do\" - while Euro accents barked in the background. </p> <p>And then, finally: \"Yes! They've done it! This is a relief to a lot of people!\" None more than Marr himself, one felt. \"It's like Olympic Taekwondo,\" noted Davis loyally. \"Not everybody under-stands what's going on, it's not always easy to commentate on, but it's very exciting all the same.\"</p>",
  "<p>The mining group Xstrata has emerged as the most expensive boardroom in the FTSE 100, paying its directors a combined \u00a330m last year.</p> <p>According to the latest annual Guardian survey of executive pay, two of the company's bosses appear in the top 10 highest paid directors in the FTSE, chief executive Mick Davis who made almost \u00a314m and Santiago Zaldumbide, who runs the firm's zinc business.</p> <p>Davis earned 424 times the average salary of \u00a333,000 paid to Xstrata employees.</p> <p>Directors who served on the boards of FTSE 100 companies last year earned a combined package of \u00a3979.2m, a gain of 5% compared with the previous year as the slowing economy kept wage inflation in the boardroom relatively in check.</p> <p>The headline figure masks the true picture of what is going on Britain's boardrooms. The Guardian annual pay survey found a widening gap between the directors at the top of the earnings pile and other directors within the blue chip index. While there was a sharp increase in the number of executives earning more than \u00a35m - 34 against 20 in the previous year - the number earning more than \u00a31m fell, from 249 in 2006 to 227 last year.</p> <p>Not only are rewards for the highest-paid executives moving further away from ordinary workers, but the gap is widening with less well paid directors as well.</p> <p>Four of the top 10 highest earners work in the banking or the financial services sector and another three in mining. The top two, however, are Sir Martin Sorrell, the former accountant who has built WPP into one of the world's largest marketing services groups, and Bart Becht who runs Reckitt Benckiser, the household goods group behind Harpic, Nurofen and Dettol. Barclays president Bob Diamond made a little over \u00a318m, though he collected another \u00a314m from a three-year performance plan shortly after the year end.</p> <p>The highest paid employees also work largely in financial services with private equity group 3i at the top and Icap, the world's biggest money broker, where employees earn an average of \u00a3210,890, coming second. London Stock Exchange employees who, on average, earn \u00a3114,106 were also in the top 10. The LSE is still reeling after a 7-hour breakdown in its computer system on Monday, which stopped traders dealing on one of the busiest days of the year.</p> <p>The next most expensive boardroom after Xstrata was Reckitt Benckiser, which paid its directors a shade below \u00a330m, Barclays (\u00a327.6m) and Tesco (\u00a327.1m). </p> <p>The employees on the lowest salaries work largely for mining companies and retailers. The lowest-paid workers are at copper miner Kazakhmys where they earn, on average, \u00a33,231. </p> <p>The cheapest board was at Admiral Group, the insurer, which paid its directors a combined \u00a31.1m. And ITV was the third cheapest, with its board directors taking home \u00a31.5m in total.</p> <p>For the first time, the Guardian/Reward Technology Forum survey has also examined directors' pay in the FTSE 250, the next 250 biggest public companies, and found large pay awards there too. The partners who run the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown both earned more than \u00a310m and Tony Pidgley, the Berkeley Homes boss who was raised in a caravan earned over \u00a37m.</p> <p>Paul Kenny, GMB general secretary, urged the government to take action on escalating pay. </p> <p>\"The Guardian survey understates the extent of the rip-offs,\" he said. \" The taxman is the only one who can stop this bonanza. GMB want a top rate of 90% [including national insurance] for pay packages worth more than \u00a33m. We might lose a few footballers and some top managers but I am sure we will manage without them\"</p> <p>The Work Foundation, a left-leaning thinktank, also said the government should intervene. </p> <p>Policy director Nick Isles said: \"This is a cultural phenomenon, not an economic phenomenon and we could do something about this if we were so minded. The Work Foundation argues that this represents a market failure and government needs to do something about it, but neither party will go near it.\" </p> <p>\"It is an incredible closed shop and those are the dynamics operating in top directors pay. The increases are based on the myth of market forces, but this is actually the antithesis of market forces.\"</p> <h2>The methodology</h2> <p>Directors' pay was calculated by adding together basic pay, value of benefits (eg cars, insurance), cash and deferred bonuses, and gains from long-term incentive plans. Pension fund payments were excluded. The data was derived from the latest annual reports of the 102 companies that are in the FTSE100, or who were during 2007 (with the exception of Carnival plc whose pay data was not included). </p> <p>It covers about 1,260 FTSE 100 directors who were paid by their employers in the previous financial year (typically 2007). Directors who left or joined boards in the year were excluded. This left 956, from whom the main lists were compiled. Of these, there were 541 executive directors and 719 non-executive; and 1,114 men and 146 women. For the first time last year, the Guardian also surveyed directors in the FTSE 250. The data was researched by the Reward Technology Forum (RTF).</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sahar Adnan</strong>, 38, and her son, Hussein Amir, 15, are Sunnis living in northern Baghdad with Sahar's five other children, the youngest of whom is two. Their father, a carpenter-turned-shopkeeper, was murdered by milita men. His body was never found. Initially, Sahar's brother-in-law took care of them but in 2007 he too was killed by gunmen. Now the family live in one room and depend on the support of neighbours. Hussein has recently returned to school after a break of three years during which his mother could not afford to pay for his uniform. He is trying to find a job to help his family. </p> <p>\"More than 20 gunmen came for my father,\" Hussein remembers. \"They put him in a four-wheel drive and I started to cry and one of them said, 'Don't be scared - everything will be OK.'

I'm still waiting for them to tell me about my father.\" </p> <p>\"The Americans were here,\" says Sahar, \"and my husband was still murdered. When my husband was alive we lived a good life. Now I live on charity. My husband controlled my boys but now it is impossible. Since the Americans came to Iraq we have had nothing but trouble. It is better that they go and just leave us alone. They've been here for five years and we had no security - so what is the point in them staying? And before they go they could release all those Iraqi men they picked up and are still keeping in their prisons.\" </p> <p><strong>Anfal Abdul Sattar</strong>, 25, lives in Mosul with her three-year-old child, Zahra. A few months after her daughter was born, her husband, Muhammed, 33, was killed by a car bomb targeting an American convey in Baghdad.</p> <p>\"I live with my parents and my three-year-old calls my father daddy,\" she says. \"I have been looking for a job since I graduated from university last year but can't find one. The security situation in Mosul is bad, and my parents don't like the idea of me going out everyday for work. Still, I insist I must have a job to be able to take care of my only daughter. We do not need the Americans at all. They have been in Iraq for five years, and what did they do to us? Let them leave so all these car bombs and killing will stop.\"</p> <p><strong>Ban Alwan</strong>, 41, a Sunni with three children, lives in Baghdad. Her husband, Salman, was a pilot in the Iraqi army. He was taken from their bedroom by a militia gang in 2005. She searched the city morgues and found his body three days later.

Their electricity costs \u00a350 a month. </p> <p>\"I want to leave Iraq but where can I go? I applied to be a refugee in Sweden but didn't hear anything. I tried to find a job but there is no work. I don't go out much because things are not safe and if I am killed who will look after the three kids? We are between two fires: the fire of the Iraqi government and the fire of the Americans. I prefer the fire of the Americans.

I was at the school and got the terrible news that a US plane had bombed our house and my brother and my wife were buried under the rubble. I lost everything. The Americans' excuse was that they suspected the house was a haven for terrorists. Now they claim they have handed over the security responsibility to the people here. It is absolutely untrue - the Americans are everywhere and the Iraqi police do not have any weapons in their hands. I swear to God, if any Iraqi says, 'Let the Americans stay to protect us', he does not have any honour, any dignity, any morals. Let them get out of our country so that we can rebuild it. </p> <p>A thousand curses on them.\"</p> <p><strong>Hafidha Humaidi</strong>, 85, has three children, the eldest of whom is 65. She lives in Kufa, Najaf. </p> <p>\"I can hardly walk so I moved to my youngest son's house so he could take care of me. I see the Americans in the roads when I go to visit my other sons; sometimes they stop our car or check but I do not mind that. I am not scared of them at all; I wish they could visit me one day at home and see what is wrong with my legs. Maybe they will get me some good medication - I am using the same old tablets I used to have even before the war and they do no good. My sons and I are worried that if the Americans leave, chaos will return. It is better they stay.\"</p> <p><strong>Anwar Omran</strong>, 32, is a Kurd living in Dohuk, north Iraq, with his four children.

If they leave, the situation will be wild, the strong parties will smash the weak. I am planning to leave; I heard that for people like me who have worked for the Americans, an office has opened in Irbil to arrange for us to go abroad. But my mother does not accept that. We will see.\"</p>",
  "<p>Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday appeared to tone down an attack on the class system by removing a swath of quotes from her speech to the TUC on government plans to tackle inequality. </p> <p>The equalities minister had been expected to say that social class rather than gender, race, sexual orientation or disability was the main reason why people failed to reach their full potential. \"What overarches all of these is where you live, your family background, your wealth and social class.\"</p> <p>Instead she confined herself to two examples: showing how six-year-olds from the middle classes were already ahead of more able peers from working-class backgrounds, and how very rich men now live longer than poorer women.</p> <p>A Labour spokeswoman said yesterday the main reason for the change was that Harman was speaking from notes and would not necessarily follow the text which had been sent out. The spokeswoman insisted that the minister had not intended to tone down her views.</p> <p>Her main announcement to the TUC was the establishment of a national equality panel chaired by Professor John Hills, of the London School of Economics.</p> <p>The panel's job will be to find out and help tackle the \" scars of inequality\", with a report due in a year's time.</p> <p>Hills told the Guardian: \"It is not just an issue whether there is a wider gap between the rich and the poor. That is far too simplistic. What we are going to do is to try and map a far more complex picture of differences between and within various groups, from pensioners to those at work, as well as looking at where they live and whether this affects their life chances.</p> <p>\"The information we gather we hope will influence government policy by giving a more accurate picture of what is really happening.\"</p> <p>The rest of Harman's speech was devoted to a savage attack on the Conservatives, heralding a drive by ministers to try to regain the offensive. She accused David Cameron of wanting women \"for one thing and one thing only - their votes\".</p> <p>Harman accused the Conservatives of \"sidling up\" to trade unionists, \"lurking around\" equality campaigns and \"fawning over\" women's groups. \"They are a false friend of equality and fairness.\"</p> <p>Theresa May, the Tory women's spokeswoman, responded with equal acerbity: \"Harriet Harman is stuck in the class warfare rhetoric of 20 years ago. She needs to wake up and realise that this is the 21st century and her party is still failing on equality.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ed Balls, the schools secretary and only member of the Co-operative party in the cabinet, will today propose that 100 schools over the next two years become co-operative trust schools owned and controlled by the local community. He will tell the annual conference of Labour's sister party that he is putting up an extra \u00a3500,000 so trust schools have extra financial help to become co-operatives. </p> <p>The move comes as Michael Stephenson, the new general secretary of the Co-operative party and a former political officer at Downing Street, claims co-ops could be on the brink of a revival in Britain. \"Co-ops are an idea whose time has come back.\" </p> <p>He is looking at how to persuade Labour to bring the co-operative model into railways, schools, housing and other public services, arguing that Labour, searching for new ideas, can find intellectual renewal in those behind co-operatives. The Co-operative party has already succeeded in persuading Network Rail to review its governance structures to see how it can make rail users part of its board. </p> <p>In a sign that senior ministers are willing to respond to a revival of co-operation, Ed Miliband, the Cabinet Office minister and a key figure behind the Labour manifesto will also speak at the Co-op party conference in London today. </p> <p>There are 29 Labour/Co-operative MPs including Balls. He is due to say: \"I want to see more parents and communities actively involved in schools and the co-operative model is an ideal way to do this. This is about putting power in the hands of those who are directly engaged with local schools, and who know best what is needed in their area. </p> <p> \"As the first co-operative trust is now successfully up and running, in Reddish Vale, Stockport, I want to see this model rolled out across the country, cultivating co-operative schools and the democratic, innovative opportunity they represent. This is about enabling any schools, or new trust partners, interested in this unique model of governance, to try this out.\"</p> <p>Unlike city academies, trust schools remain part of the local education authority, but in the co-op model parents, staff, teachers, pupils and the wider local community are encouraged to become members of the trust, making them effective owners of the school. A department official said they would also have more control over the curriculum, discipline policy and could also instil an ethos of co-operation within the school.</p> <p>Schools that join the trust schools programme are eligible to receive up to \u00a310,000 from government to support the costs of setting up a trust. </p> <p>Those wishing to adopt the co-operative model will now be able to recoup an extra \u00a35,000 to engage consultants to assist in developing the innovative model. The schools minister, Lord Adonis, backed the move, saying he was urging \"schools to look to this style of governance to put power in the hands of the people they serve\".</p> <p>Peter Marks, chief executive of the 3 million-strong Co-operative group, said his chain will be supporting the initiative. \"We are convinced that this ethos, which is built on our co-operative values dating back more than 150 years, will lead to higher standards, aspirations and achievements.\"</p>",
  "<p>A brief incursion on to a private road past the home of Josiah Wedgwood just before the finish threw the Tour of Britain wide open yesterday. The road was narrow and bendy and caused a spate of punctures, throwing the field into a state of panic just as the battle for the stage finish was hotting up. Bedlam was a little way back down the road but, briefly, chaos reigned.</p> <p>The Frenchman Emilien Berg\u00e8s, who had started the stage in the yellow jersey, hit a pothole and punctured his back tyre, changing his bike only for the front tyre to go down two kilometres later. He chased desperately but the Italian team LPR piled on the pressure at the front of the peloton, making it impossible for him and his team-mates to regain contact.</p> <p>Berg\u00e8s, a delighted stage winner in Burnham-on-Sea on Tuesday, finished 1min 13sec behind yesterday's victor, Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway, but, fortunately, the Frenchman's Agritubel squad had another card up their sleeve. The runner-up at Burnham, Geoffroy Lequatre, was lying second overall, remained with the leaders and took over the yellow jersey, unsure whether to smile at his good fortune or rue his team-mate's ill-luck.</p> <p>The six-man French squad had a grim day at the office, spending the entire race pursuing a 10-rider escape that included four Britons and eventually produced the stage winner. Ben Swift of the Great Britain team was chasing points for the King of the Mountains prize and with him were the national road-race champion, Rob Hayles, Scotland's David Millar, riding the first Tour of Britain of his long career, and Dan Lloyd of the Irish team An Post. Among their companions were Boasson Hagen and the Australian Stuart O'Grady, winner of the PruTour of Britain in 1998.</p> <p>Only one of the 10 was a threat in the overall standings, the Italian Gairo Ermeti, but there was the rub for the French, who could not afford to give him too much leeway. They received no assistance from any of the other squads but looked to have the situation under control until disaster struck Berg\u00e8s.</p> <p>The final kilometres of a stage covered at more than 27mph were pulsating, with the peloton closing rapidly on the nine escapees - Hayles had dropped back after a steep climb out of the Severn valley at Coalbrookdale - and Berg\u00e8s plus various team-mates trying their utmost to regain contact. On the climb to the finish outside the town hall, Boasson Hagen heard his British team-mate Roger Hammond shout at him from the peloton, by now a few metres behind. \"Attack\" yelled the points leader so the Norwegian sprang away with Ermeti to take the stage.</p> <p>Ironically on a day when most discussion centred on a force from the past, Lance Armstrong, the spiky-haired Norwegian is clearly set to be one of cycling's future stars. At only 21, he is one of a group of up-and-coming youngsters in Mark Cavendish's Columbia team and has already won more than 25 races over the past three seasons.</p> <p>Just 14 seconds cover the first seven riders overall and the race is wide open. Steve Cummings of the Barloworld team moved up to second yesterday thanks to a strong finish and he, Daniel Fleeman and Ian Stannard all have a chance of becoming the first Briton to win the home Tour in almost 20 years, although today's tough North Yorkshire stage will doubtless shake up the standings again.</p>",
  "<p>Harriet Harman went to the TUC in Brighton yesterday and stirred things up on class, not something New Labour often chose to do in its prime. During their political teens Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had seen how crude class rhetoric no longer played well with the Middle Britain voters they were courting. On the equality agenda there were heady distractions on race, gender, sexual orientation and - less raucously - disability.</p> <p>So class went out of fashion, but it never went away. As the irreproachably middle class Harman said in her text, prepared but not actually delivered, overarching all the other inequalities is \"where you live, your family background, your wealth and social class\". Even that mild and self-evident observation was enough to provoke outrage at the Telegraph. </p> <p>Academic studies and official statistics confirm that income inequality has grown in Britain under Labour, despite the billions poured into alleviating poverty. Access to the good things of life - university education, a decent home - are still unfairly distributed and voters are aware of it. </p> <p>But it's all more complicated than we think. As Trevor Phillips, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said in July, Britain needs to move beyond a \"strand\" approach to the problem which stresses a single characteristic - race, sex or family background. Thus a rich disabled person will be better placed than a poor one, but not as much as the fully-abled. </p> <p>What arch-feminist Harman's latest initiative seeks to do is tease out the deeper reasons for success and failure, across all those strands.</p> <p>The government's instrument will be an expert body, the National Equality Panel, chaired by LSE professor John Hills, and tasked with a factual analysis of equality trends since 1997 and how the various strands interact and reinforce people's varying life chances. </p> <p>Last night Hills suggested that the income structure in Britain, sometimes described as an hourglass - dividing the prosperous skilled from declining manual work - might better be compared to the onion dome on a Russian Orthodox church.</p> <p>The middle-class bulge in the middle has actually got a bit bigger, but those right at the top, the 0.1% super-rich, have raced ahead. </p> <p>In his speech, Phillips confirmed what Blairism's critics on the left have long asserted, that white working class boys - Irish and British - have suffered in comparison with other groups vulnerable to inequality. Even the frequent assertion that Indians do best among ethnic minority groups is open to challenge: examine their high educational levels and their relative pay still suffers, says Hills.</p> <p>As the economy falters, there are fears that progress will falter too. In truth it will be years before Britain knows whether Labour's efforts to improve social mobility have paid off.</p>",
  "<p>American Express, the international banking, travel and freight organisation, yesterday opened an extended credit card service in Britain.</p> <p>Holders of the cards will be able to use them at nearly 3,000 hotels, restaurants, shops and hire-car agencies in this country and at more than 83,000 establishments abroad. In addition, the cards can be used to obtain travel tickets at the organisation's offices in 33 countries.</p> <p>Mr M. Elliot, general manager for the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, said in London yesterday that to cater for the local cardholder and to give fullest coverage, the company was expanding the number of establishments in Britain which would honour the card.</p> <p>Until now American Express service has been confined to people who could settle their accounts in dollars. There are almost one million cardholders in the United States. Mr Elliot said: \"We have been encouraged to launch a service here by increasing confidence in sterling and growing demand for a sterling credit card.</p> <p>\"We expect to have at least 20,000 cardholders in Britain in the first year.\" The service is intended primarily for business executives or professional men and women with a minimum income of about \u00a32,500 a year.</p> <p>A recent survey of cardholders in the US showed that 97 per cent were businessmen; 89 per cent earned more than \u00a33,500 a year and 42 per cent \u00a37,000 a year. Only 1 per cent were women and most men who used the cards were married and owned their own homes. It is expected that a similar pattern will emerge among cardholders in Britain.</p> <p>The annual fee will be \u00a33 12s but supplementary cards can be obtained at half price for immediate family members. </p> <p>The Bank of England has approved the use of the cards abroad but has restricted the amount that can be spent on any one article to \u00a375. The company itself limits the amount of credit for a single article to \u00a3170 without special sanction.</p> <p>Mr Elliot said that the organisation had experienced very little bad debt in the United States and that the annual \"billing rate\" now amounted to 200 million dollars.</p> <p>\"We check the standing of applicants with their banks and through the normal mercantile channels (he said). We find married men who own their homes are generally the best risks.\"</p> <p>The organisation, which was founded by Wells Fargo, has been operating in Britain since 1895 and now has 700 employees in this country. It may extend the service to other countries in Europe if the British project succeeds.</p>",
  "<p>I love people-watching.

I didn't buy any - I don't have the stamina. And I was working, of course. By the time I got to the racetrack, it was raining, typically. I wandered around looking at people, who would see me checking them out and think: \"Why is she looking at me?\" I didn't know if I was going to find anything interesting, and I almost got a bit negative, thinking, \"Why did I come here? I've gone through all the palaver, but am I actually going to get anything?\"</p> <p>Then the first race started. Everyone stopped and focused on it. The energy is exciting. When they're all watching the race, I'm a bit more invisible and can look at the crowd. </p> <p>Out of all the characters around me, I found this lady particularly interesting. My eye was drawn to her. That action of holding that booklet over her face, almost blinkering herself. It was intriguing. I wasn't sure if she was upset, pensive or just excited. She was doing it throughout the race, and looked as though she was going to start crying. She almost seemed as if she was worrying about something else. I couldn't tell. And I still don't know.

  "<p>A 15-year-old girl walks up to an Iraqi police checkpoint on her way to the crowded central market in Baquba, a town some 40 miles north of Baghdad. A constable senses something odd and demands she be searched. The girl promptly announces she is wearing a suicide belt, strapped like a lethal corset round her waist. </p> <p>In police footage that has gone around the world on YouTube, Rania Ibrahim is handcuffed to metal railings while male officers get her to remove her outer garments, then carefully defuse the device. Never mind the fact that the area is not cordoned off, and other policemen wander close to the girl to gawp. It took not only exceptional bravery but a degree of professionalism that many in Baghdad had not credited the Iraqi police with. The officer who disabled the device was given a 5m dinar (about \u00a32,400) bonus.</p> <p>Horror, relief, amazement - but beyond the emotions aroused, a crucial question remains unresolved a fortnight after Ibrahim and many others escaped death. Was she a victim or a villain? And whatever her motives, why has the number of female suicide bombers soared during the past year in a nation that, with Egypt, Syria and Lebanon, has long been seen as one of the most developed and secular societies in the Middle East? </p> <p>Lt Col DA Sims, deputy commanding officer of the Baquba-based US 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, whose staff also interrogated the girl, has an open mind about Ibrahim's intentions - whether someone strapped the bomb to her against her will and she deliberately behaved oddly at the checkpoint so as to be discovered, or whether she did intend to blow herself up but was pre-empted by police and then tried to lie herself out of trouble.</p> <p>\"The Iraqi police identified her as suspicious and she immediately said, 'Hey, I want to turn myself in.' She realised she was making a mistake,\" Sims says. He is not sure whether the mistake was to start out on a road leading to a violent early death, or to get caught before fulfilling her mission.</p> <p>Saja Qaduri, a member of the Diyala provincial council (Baquba is Diyala's capital) and the only woman on its security committee, sat in on some of the police interrogation of Ibrahim. She believes the girl was a committed would-be suicide bomber.</p> <p>Qaduri says that the girl spoke in a slow, drowsy way during the first moments after the suicide belt had been defused and taken off her, and appeared to have been drugged. But this did not mean she was being made to do something against her will. It could have been done to dull her emotions and reduce the chance of her backing off when the moment came to trigger the belt. \"I was at the police station when they first brought her in for questioning. As the pills wore off, she spoke in a very confident way. She strongly believed her death would have taken her to heaven. She was detected because some wires were visible. A policeman spotted it,\" Qaduri adds. </p> <p>In spite of her faith that suicide and murder would take her to paradise, Ibrahim showed flashes of teenage confusion. \"At the end of every sentence, she kept saying 'I want my mum'\", Qaduri says. </p> <p>If Ibrahim was a genuinely willing suicide bomber, wider and more complex issues of motivation need to be probed. It doesn't remove the victim-or-villain issue. </p> <p>Diyala, named after one of the rivers that flow through it (the other is the Tigris), is one of the most conservative rural provinces in Iraq. In its most fertile south-eastern region date palms, orange groves and pomegranate trees stretch for mile after mile along a network of irrigation canals. Few roads are paved, donkey carts are common, and villages are isolated. Tribal structures are strong, male dominance is all-pervasive, and women have suffered repression for centuries. By the age of 15 many girls are married - as Ibrahim was. Few can read. </p> <p>In this restrictive context, \"these women are also victims of the situation\", says Qaduri. \"Even this 15-year-old, you feel sorry for her, very young and uneducated. She has no awareness. She comes from a very poor family. Her husband is on the run as a suspected al-Qaida terrorist. He told her he would meet her in paradise.\" (He was arrested by Iraqi police in the town of Hit about a week later.) </p> <p>The view of Iraq as a member of the club of the Middle East's more developed and secular countries is not wrong - as far as it goes. Essentially this applies to the Baghdad area, with its large, well-travelled middle class, many of whose women and men are fluent English speakers from the days when English was the language of instruction in almost every medical and engineering college. (Under Saddam Hussein, and even more so as a result of the chaos unleashed by the US occupation, hundreds of thousands have fled abroad, totalling between a third and a half of the country's best-educated professionals.)</p> <p>But among the substantial population in the countryside, as well as a swelling generation of rural migrants who are pulled or pushed into urban slums by the prospect of better pay, country traditions still hold sway in the lives of women: tribal values and patriarchal culture remain extremely strong.</p> <p>In villages and small towns, women are considered little more than chattels who may not go out of the home unless accompanied by their husbands or a male relative. Three wars in a quarter of a century have left Iraq with more than a million young or middle-aged widows. They are not permitted to live alone, nor do most want to. The death of a husband is not just a cause of grief, bereavement and loneliness. It collapses a woman's sense of worth, within her extended family as well as in the wider community. Her protection is gone, plus her source of financial support. Unless the woman remarries - a rarity, given the shortage of men - a nephew or a male cousin will be required to move into the house to provide protection, unless one or more of her sons is already in his late teens.</p> <p>The result can be corrosive levels of depression that haunt women who have seen fathers, brothers, and husbands killed - so, while Ibrahim is the first female suicide bomber to be thwarted in Diyala, many others have gone out into the street wearing a deadly hidden belt. Throughout Iraq some 43 women have carried out suicide bombings since 2003, mostly in the past two years. In 2007 eight women blew themselves up. This year the number is already 30, of whom 15 were in Diyala.</p> <p>On a single day in July, four women exploded their belts in Baghdad and the northern city of Kirkuk, killing at least 44 people. The Iraqi police and US military sources blame al-Qaida for almost all the attacks. Though the movement was brought to Iraq by foreign Arabs, all but one of the woman bombers were Iraqi. Most were between the ages of 15 and 35.</p> <p>Iraq is not the first Arab country to produce a woman suicide bomber. The first recorded case took place in Lebanon in 1985, where a young pro-Syrian militant targeted an Israeli army unit. In the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, bombings by women have also become more frequent, with 10 attacks since 2002.</p> <p>Women suicide bombers in Iraq are still far outnumbered by their male counterparts but simple logistics offer one explanation for the upward trend: it is a fair bet that men are pushing women into doing this \"man's job\" because they usually have a better chance of passing checkpoints wearing their long black cloaks, and male police feel inhibited about touching them. The Diyala police force has recruited 200 women to work at checkpoints and 20 women will graduate from the local police college next month.</p> <p>Part of the answer to why the chaos launched by the US occupation has impinged so sharply on Diyala, turning a rural backwater into a destructive and self-destructive cauldron of violence, lies in the province's combination of rural conservatism and unusual ethnic makeup. This combination has made it (including its women) vulnerable to political exploitation, not least by al-Qaida, a group that wasn't active in Iraq until the US invasion in 2003.</p> <p>Most of Iraq's 18 provinces have one dominant group, whether it be Kurds in the three northern provinces, Arab Shias in Basra and the south-east, or Arab Sunnis in Anbar and Saddam's province of Salaheddin. Only Baghdad, the metropolitan area encompassing Nineveh and the city of Mosul, and Diyala have a more even mix.</p> <p>The balance in Diyala is particularly precarious, with roughly one-third Kurd, one-third Arab Shia and one-third Arab Sunni. The Kurds mainly live in the distant north-east so the main struggle for influence, once al-Qaida arrived to try to exploit sectarianism, has been between Arab Sunnis and Shias. It centres on Baquba and the crucial south-western corner of the province that connects Baghdad to the north.</p> <p>Some Sunnis in the area were close to Saddam and his Ba'ath party; graffiti supporting him could often be seen on walls in the rural parts of Diyala. Other non-Baathist nationalist groups sprang up to confront the Americans in the early months of the occupation. Before the Iraqi army was reconstituted, the US responded with air strikes, ground offensives and mass round-ups of villagers, which, as in Afghanistan, tended to create a pool of people seeking revenge or redress.</p> <p>Al-Qaida came into this mix in 2004, stirring up anti-Shia suspicions by claiming the Shia were all agents of Iran and no longer true Muslims anyway, an ideology known as takfir. Since the government in Baghdad was Shia-led, it was easy to convince the ignorant that Iraq was under occupation by Iran as well as the US.</p> <p>US military officials say investigations of the family circumstances of the women suicide bombers who succeeded put them into three rough categories: women whose husbands, fathers or brothers, were killed by US or Iraqi forces; women who accepted the takfiri line that all Shia are enemies and must be killed; and women who were married at a young age to an al-Qaida man and sometimes were passed on from him to others in a pattern that is untypical of normal Iraqi life, and leaves women feeling worthless, violated and desperate.</p> <p>\"We're finding a disillusioned woman,\" says Sims. \"Al-Qaida has led her to believe [in its ideology], or she may have resentment against the Iraqi government or coalition forces.\" He hopes Ibrahim's case will influence other women. \"I would hope there are women who were either tempted, or coerced, or persuaded but have now realised that the value of women's rights and the role of women in society will be greater by not blowing themselves up\".</p> <p>Qaduri is a Shia. Her husband was a member of prime minister Nouri al-Maliki's party. He was kidnapped two years ago at a bogus police checkpoint on his way from university to collect her from her job at the council offices. No ransom demand was ever made and she has not heard from him since. She assumes the crime was committed by al-Qaida and speaks energetically about the group's negative influence, pointing out that none of the women bombers were Shia. </p> <p>She acknowledges that Sunnis have also suffered from al-Qaida. Nationalist insurgent groups (she names one called Hamas in Iraq, and another called the 1920 Revolutionary Brigades) were active in Diyala before al-Qaida but they then started to work with it, she says. </p> <p>\"When al-Qaida began to control Baquba and said, 'We've freed the area', the other groups said, 'You came to our country. We should be in charge.' They started to create the 'Awakening Movement' of Sunnis against al-Qaida but al-Qaida assassinated many of them,\" she adds. Al-Qaida went on to proclaim Qatun, a town in Diyala west of Baquba, the first capital of the Islamic State of Iraq, a move that alienated many other Sunnis.</p> <p>By then al-Qaida had infiltrated Diyala's isolated rural areas, getting tribes and subtribes to join them. Women were soon brought into the net. \"Typically, a young woman's father or brother may be working with al-Qaida and they force the girl to marry an al-Qaida leader. She may not have met the man before. In some cases there is a formal marriage. We have found certificates from their Islamic State of Iraq with husbands' names that are Sudanese, Saudi, Afghan, Pakistani, Yemeni, and Egyptian,\" Qaduri says. </p> <p>Ibrahim's husband is Iraqi and \"has some clear al-Qaida attachments\", says Sims. </p> <p>In other cases girls have been handed to an al-Qaida man, and then to another when the first one left the area or was killed. Arrested al-Qaida leaders have given information that led to raids on houses in Diyala where women were found who, Iraqi police believe, were being prepared for suicide bombing. In one house they came across a pregnant 15-year-old who said she had been married a dozen times and had no idea who the father of her child was. \"These girls are very depressed and ready to end their lives,\" Qaduri says. </p> <p>The same is true of young women whose husbands, fathers, or brothers have been killed by US or Iraqi forces, a category that she and other officials say is larger than that of the al-Qaida converts or those forced into marriage with al-Qaida members. </p> <p>Can the phenomenon be stopped? Last year the Americans started a re-education programme in the prisons where they hold Iraqis. Helped by the Iraqi Islamic party, which represents moderate Sunni Islamists and fiercely opposes al-Qaida, the programme aims to expose takfir as heresy unsupported by the Qu'ran. Adult Sunni prisoners attend the classes.</p> <p>Dealing with young women who are vulnerable to al-Qaida recruiting in remote parts of Diyala is a harder task. Qaduri says the priority has to be to restore peace and security to Iraq. Ideally, she would have women's shelters and rehabilitation programmes for young women. But this is not realistic now. In the meantime, the 20 or so young women whom police identified as potential bombers remain at home in the enclosed and sad environment that has led others like them to blow themselves up. Qaduri sums up the dilemma: \"We don't have proof, so they are still living there\".</p>",
  "<p>This isn't going to be easy. Not least since I've just swallowed a shard from a duck bone. Interviewing people in restaurants is always a mistake - they're just about to admit to killing their father or doing something unspeakable to their mother when the meringue arrives - and the Chuen Cheng Ku Chinese restaurant on the edge of London's Soho may be a bigger mistake than most as the waitress speaks hardly any English and I have only the haziest idea what I am eating.</p> <p>But the food writer Elisabeth Luard was keen to get some lunch, so here we are, talking about her new memoir, My Life as a Wife, which scampers through 40 years of marriage to the racy Nicholas Luard, proprietor and saviour of Private Eye in its infancy, co-founder with Peter Cook of the pioneering early 1960s Establishment comedy club, travel writer, novelist, co-founder of the London marathon, conservationist, anti-apartheid campaigner, alcoholic, philanderer and all-round impossible husband. </p> <p>Luard died of cancer in 2004. The book is a portrait of a marriage, and its opening nicely captures the ambiguity of the relationship. \"This is the story of my life as a wife. Or how to stay married for 40 years without actually murdering your husband. A love story.\" The verdict, Luard tells me when I've extracted the duck bone from my throat, could have gone either way.</p> <p>\"It started as the story of a marriage,\" she says, \"and I didn't think it was going to end up like that [as a love letter]. It was basically how to stay married for 40 years without actually murdering the bastard. That was the core of what I embarked on, but writing it was like the truth and reconciliation commission. It really did change. I could suddenly <br>understand why people need to speak about things, because if you speak about them they lose their sharpness.\"</p> <p>Luard was alcohol dependent all his life; extramarital affair dependent, too, if the stories in the book are to be believed. Such as the time, when they were living in Spain, that he managed to give a sexually transmitted disease to both his wife and the au pair. Wasn't she mad to stay with him - except for a year-long separation in the early 1970s when her patience finally ran out - through thick and thin?</p> <p>We never quite get to the heart of this central question. First, she offers negative reasons for sticking around. \"I wanted to say this is how a marriage happens. It's self-evidently not all plain sailing. There's a lot of encouragement now to run for the hills, but there are other considerations. It's a different decision when you have children - and a different decision, too, even when your children are adult, because if you have someone in the kind of physical condition Nicholas was in, your children, if they're well brought up, would pick up the pieces when you walk away.\"</p> <p>When I protest that this sounds more like force of circumstance than grand passion, she changes tack. \"You can sound a bit elitist if you say, 'I loved living with this man who was so literate, so interesting.' I liked the fact that he had a very fine, very educated mind, and after 40 years of marriage we could sit across the table from each other and discuss whatever we wanted. That was great, and that's what I miss with Nicholas. His political ideas were so interesting. You can see that with his career, his conservation work. That ability to see the way we should go, and then get up and do it.\"</p> <p>The truth may be that Luard herself doesn't know what kept them together. \"When a love affair is over,\" she says in the book, \"whatever the reason, the heart and mind keep the print. </p> <p>I can draw no conclusions from the life that we shared. All I can say is that this is what happened at that particular moment, this is how it was, this is how it seemed to me. Some things are left unsaid. We are free to choose what we remember and what we forget.\" There are no definitive portraits of a marriage.</p> <p>The book's title seems self-deprecating for someone who has built a successful career in her own right as an illustrator, food writer and author. Why put herself down in that way? </p> <p>\"I called it that because it's the truth,\" she says. \"My life was completely dictated by the fact that I was a wife, and it's written for all those people who are wives. I used to get asked when I was knee-deep in four children: 'Do you work?'\"</p> <p>Her background was privileged - wealthy mother, airman father killed in the war, diplomat stepfather with whom she didn't get on - but peculiar. She was a debutante in 1959, but quickly saw through the charade. \"I was outraged by the whole business,\" she says, \"which wasn't bad for a 17-year-old. It was like a cattle market. I remember thinking this is not that much different from what goes on in Soho, for heaven's sake. We've both got a price - ours just happens to be higher.\"</p> <p>She was smart but uneducated - this was a time when posh women were meant to be good at entertaining and motherhood, and not much else. Her mother, who was living in Mexico with her diplomat husband, paid Luard's rent, but she had to earn her keep, which is how she came to be working in Private Eye's cramped office above the Establishment club in Greek Street, where she fell in love - more or less at first sight - with her husband-to-be. </p> <p>They married in 1963, had four children in quick succession, and decamped to Spain when the satire bubble burst and Luard's business enterprises foundered. He turned to writing instead, starting with a highly regarded book on Andalucia, but money thereafter was tight and, once her children were bigger, Elisabeth had of necessity to embark on her own career. </p> <p>\"I needed to earn a living,\" she says, \"and I was never not busy.\"</p> <p>She wrote European Peasant Cookery, The Princess and the Pheasant, The Barricaded Larder and The Flavours of Andalucia, and even tried her hand at a novel. Then in 1996, she produced Family Life, a happy book about bringing up her peripatetic family (conceived, she says, as a \"My Family and Other Animals-type memoir, with recipes and drawings\") that ends with a tragedy that played out as she was writing the book - the death from Aids of her eldest daughter Francesca in 1994.</p> <p>Francesca's death is detailed in a moving coda, told from the perspective of both mother and daughter. \"Knowing the inevitable,\" writes Luard, \"she made certain that everyone who knew and loved her understood perfectly what had happened to her - and then she set the matter aside and went about reorganising her life.\" Francesca gave up her job as a journalist on the Daily Mail, where she covered lifestyle subjects, and took up painting instead. \"Life's too short for shopping,\" she told her mother.</p> <p>\"I think she knew who she got it [HIV] from,\" Luard tells me. \"She very bravely rang up the list of exes and said, 'Oi, you'd better go and get yourself tested.' She knew about five, and the sixth said he hadn't picked up the result ... But she had no rancour about it. She was much more worried about who she had passed it on to. She was really remarkable.\"</p> <p>That coda in Family Life also hints at the accommodation she and her husband reached in the painfully bright days they spent nursing their daughter, and afterwards, when they returned to the remote farmhouse in Wales that Nicholas had inherited from his godmother. </p> <p>\"We find,\" she writes - just a few years before Luard was himself diagnosed with cancer - \"that the division of our labours means that we have neither grown apart nor together, but in parallel. Perhaps because of this we still find each other surprising and interesting. Unexpectedly, after three decades of independent living, we can still learn from each other. We know one another's weaknesses and strengths - and, after all these years, take care not to tap too hard on the cracks.\"</p> <p>After lunch, Luard has her photograph taken - a neat touch, this - in the nightclub that now occupies the old Establishment club premises in Greek Street. With a nod to its heritage, it is called Zebrano at the Establishment. Luard, preening for the camera, looks pleased to be back. Then she heads off, ploughing her way through the traffic in Piccadilly Circus and shouting after me: \"The one thing that what you called my privileged upbringing gave me was a belief that everything would be all right. I don't fear anything.\" As if I needed telling. How else could she have survived the successive losses of devoted daughter and errant husband, and still be in love with the world? </p> <p>My Life as a Wife is published by Timewell Press (\u00a316.99).

  "<p>A long-awaited \u00a31bn energy package aimed at helping households cope with rising fuel bills, including improved cold weather payments of around \u00a325 per head, will be unveiled today by Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Ministers are hoping the political and public response to the proposals will be more favourable than the muted response to the prime minister's efforts last week to boost the housing market.</p> <p>The programme is expected to have two central prongs that will include new money for existing energy-saving schemes under the government's carbon emissions reduction target (Cert), and a new community-based programme, again aimed at carbon reduction measures.</p> <p>Brown's decision to associate himself personally with the measure is a sign of his belief that it represents a substantial attempt to deal with one of the underlying reasons for high fuel bills - the fuel inefficiency of millions of Britain's homes.</p> <p>Under the deal hammered out yesterday by ministers and the energy companies after weeks of fraught negotiations, funding for Cert will be increased by 20%, about \u00a3560m. The new community programme, which is expected to be called the community energy saving programme, will raise a further \u00a3350m, equivalent to 12.5% of the existing Cert funding.</p> <p>Additional measures make the package worth more than \u00a31bn. Much of it will be directed free at Britain's poorest households.</p> <p>Half the cash for the community scheme will come from the big six energy suppliers - British Gas, Scottish and Southern Energy, E.ON, npower, EDF Energy and ScottishPower - based on their market shares. The rest will come from the electricity generators, which includes the big six, as well as independents such as Drax, British Energy and International Power.</p> <p>A senior E.ON executive was accused of insensitivity last night when he essayed a joke about high prices. Asked what expensive gas prices would mean this winter, Mark Owen-Lloyd said: \"It will make more money for us.\"</p> <p>Energy companies expect Brown to make it clear the government does not intend to press ahead with a windfall tax, but does intend to press for the auctioning of all permits under the third phase of the EU's emissions trading scheme.</p> <p>On energy efficiency, it is estimated that 11m homes in England are built with cavity walls and around 7.7m with solid walls. Better wall insulation could save households more than \u00a3150 a year, while better roof insulation could save \u00a350 per year.</p> <p>Unions and Labour leftwingers are still calling on the government to levy a one-off \u00a36bn windfall tax on the main energy and oil companies. Disillusioned by the failure of the PM and the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to commit to either a windfall tax or tougher control of fuel prices, the unions plan to raise the issues again at the Labour party conference in Manchester this month.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Tony Moffat knows a thing or two about drugs. From dope-testing athletes to examining drugs such as cannabis or quality-control checks on prescription medicines, his expertise is much in demand. Now, as emeritus professor of pharmaceutical analysis at the School of Pharmacy, University of London, he's developed a quick portable way of testing for counterfeit medicines.</p> <p>Unlike other countries, counterfeit medicines are yet to become a serious problem for the UK as around 80% of all prescriptions are free on the NHS, so there's no incentive. \"In the past three or four years, there have been about five instances where counterfeit medicines have infiltrated into the legitimate supply chain,\" says Moffat.</p> <p><strong>Faking it</strong></p> <p>The motivation for counterfeiters, just as with handbags or perfumes, is profit from trading on somebody else's good name. They buy cheap, often substandard ingredients, cut down or omit active compounds and ignore quality control. Counterfeit medicines harm patients and deny pharmaceutical companies revenue for new research. Counterfeits may account for 10% of medicines globally with perhaps one third in some developing countries.</p> <p>You're not going to spot a counterfeit just by looking at the packet or the pills. Nor does counterfeit mean medically useless although, in places like Africa, it may contain only milk powder. \"If you sell counterfeit Cialis tablets but it contains something that works, people will buy them again,\" says Moffat.</p> <p>Distinguishing counterfeit from genuine can be done, though it requires a well-equipped laboratory using techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Both are used for quality control, an area he knows well. \"We wanted to tweak the methods which we'd been developing for quality control to detect counterfeits,\" says Moffat.</p> <p>That meant bringing testing out of well-equipped laboratories and into warehouses, wholesalers, hospitals and pharmacies. As it's fast and non-destructive, Moffat felt that NIRS was the ideal tool. NIRS involves measuring the absorption of infrared light by a sample to \"see\" in a suspect tablet what the naked eye cannot. It produces an absorption spectrum or chemical fingerprint that is characteristic of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and the non-active ingredients.</p> <p>The main hurdle - other than buying a small, portable (it is used on a desktop) NIRS instrument (NIR Technology Systems), writing some software, and building a custom-made sample cell to hold tablets for testing - was to buy some counterfeit medicines and test the technique.</p> <p>Moffat's first attempt on the internet produced only genuine tablets. \"I thought, we'll go to some sites that look really dodgy and buy them from there.\" This time, he succeeded, with four out of nine purchases for erectile dysfunction tablets proving counterfeit. \"If you go to dodgy internet sites, there's a 50% chance that you're going to get something which is counterfeit,\" he warns. </p> <p>Since then, Moffat has obtained counterfeit medicines via the Korean Food and Drugs Agency for testing and published the results in the Journal of Near Infrared Spectroscopy. Used in conjunction with a computer for data analysis and counterfeit recognition, the NIRS instrument is sensitive enough that readings may be taken through transparent packaging.</p> <p><strong>Testing, testing</strong></p> <p>\"It alerts you to any potential problems,\" says Moffat of the new screening test, which costs very little to operate. \"What you can do is to take this into a warehouse and use it there. You don't need to send the stuff to a laboratory.\"</p> <p>During his research work, Moffat found out how the counterfeiters try to mimic genuine medicines. \"When we shine the near-infrared beam on a tablet, it's not just picking out the active drug. It actually looks at everything which is in the tablet,\" he says. \"We found some Cialis tablets, for example, which should contain the drug called tadalafil - they didn't. They contained sildenafil, the active drug in Viagra.\" And where different counterfeit tablets contain the same ingredients, this points to a common source.</p> <p>Dr Paul Newton of the University of Oxford's Centre for Tropical Medicine led an international epidemiological investigation into counterfeit artesunate (an anti-malarial) - work that enabled Chinese authorities to make several arrests. Laboratory tests on the counterfeits showed little or no active ingredient, which made them useless for malaria treatment. Newton therefore believes that a portable machine would help inspectors rapidly access a pharmacy's drug supply on the spot without having to wait for testing. He adds: \"It will be very interesting to see how these machines perform in the field in comparison with other rapid techniques and how inexpensive they can be made.\"</p>",
  "<p>At the best of times the first lesson after the long summer holidays can feel unending. But at the RSA academy in Tipton that feeling may be more justified, because the lessons are three hours long. </p> <p>Three-hour lessons, a longer day and school year and 90 pupils to a class makes the RSA academy sound like boot camp. But it has also scrapped homework, subject areas and streaming and is using a curriculum designed to train pupils in the skills that will serve them in life, before they learn the facts and figures that will get them through a GCSE. </p> <p>\"Our pupils become more competent learners. They will be much more well-rounded, not just better at exams but better at understanding the world, their community and about tolerance,\" says the school's principal, Michael Gernon.</p> <p>The lessons are based on a curriculum called Opening Minds developed by the school's sponsor, the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). </p> <p>Three-hour lessons mean they do a project in a morning, instead of over a week. Pupils rarely sit still for long and textbooks are rarely used. Instead, they learn skills in communication, managing themselves, working in teams and understanding their responsibilities.</p> <p>Tipton's children are largely white, working class and poor. The West Midlands school abuts a large estate known locally as the Lost City. With only one road linking it to the rest of the world it's easy to lose yourself in its labyrinthine streets.</p> <p>\"People who grow up here don't leave. There are long-held attitudes. Education isn't a priority and we need to change that,\" says Gernon. </p> <p>On the first day the year seven pupils are putting together a learning calendar where they will record their aims and achievements through the year. They learn to take digital photos and produce individual calendars. The 90 pupils in the class take turns to do tasks and have three teachers present at all times. One teacher, Rebecca Richardson, says the large classes are not a problem. \"You've just got to have good classroom control. You could teach 120 in a class if you wanted.\"</p> <p>The year eight pupils love having no homework - a slightly longer day means their evenings are their own - and point out that three-hour lessons mean they don't spend their days traipsing from one class to another. They even like the new school term arrangement, admitting that the six-week summer holidays got boring. The academy has five terms, interspersed with two-week holidays, and four weeks in summer. </p> <p>One year eight girl says: \"Everybody wants to go here now. People think you're dead posh because you come from a privately run academy but really we're not.\" It was exactly this sentiment that the Blair government wanted academies to inspire, and the RSA academy is more Blairite than most. Its chief executive, Matthew Taylor, was Tony Blair's chief policy adviser until 2006.</p> <p>Gernon says it is not a political institution but it does have high ambitions. \"Our role is to create a blueprint for a new educational system,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We want to start a different way of learning, which breeds success but still meets all the accountability measures, so we can prove you can break out of the shackles of the national curriculum and get away from the fear of league tables. </p> <p>\"It's a big statement, I know it is. But that's our mission.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's become a hardy perennial of British public life that almost whatever trade unions do, they are ritually abused across much of the media. Where once they were absurdly said to be running the country, they are now dismissed as irrelevant loudmouths. No matter that unions remain by far the country's largest democratic social organisations and a good deal closer to mainstream public opinion - on everything from corporate profiteering to super-rich taxation - than the political leaders and newspapers that denounce them. They are still \"dinosaurs\" living in \"cloud-cuckoo land\", as far as papers such as the Sun and the Mail are concerned - whose owners were at the forefront of union-busting in the 1980s and still refuse to recognise unions to this day. </p> <p>That has been the background noise throughout this week's Trades Union Congress in Brighton. The more unions press the government to protect its own core voters - or offer a practical alternative economic programme to offset the impact of recession, as the TUC did this week - the more strident the attacks on them become. When public sector unions announced plans at the weekend to coordinate industrial action against cuts in real wages in the coming months, the media was awash with hoary predictions of a return to the 1970s and another \"winter of discontent\".</p> <p>That is wildly out of proportion. The mass walkouts on the eve of Margaret Thatcher's election were on a far bigger scale than anything on the cards now. But there are echoes of those days that should be a warning to Gordon Brown as he fights for political survival. Not only is an unelected prime minister struggling, as in 1978-9, to get to grips with an economic crisis and a resurgent Tory party. But the attempt to impose a 2% pay cap for three years in a row, with headline inflation now at 5%, closely mirrors the folly that triggered the industrial breakdown in the dog days of the Callaghan administration.</p> <p>Take the combination of effective pay cuts being imposed on six million public sector workers with escalating food and fuel costs, and the result is a dangerous double squeeze on the living standards of traditional Labour supporters. Brown's hapless fall guy, chancellor Alistair Darling, told TUC delegates on Tuesday that while current inflation was mainly caused by the global rise in oil and food prices, their members would have to tighten their belts to prevent inflation \"becoming entrenched\". </p> <p>It was just as well no one had the chance to challenge him on why that might be the case, as there's no economic reason why a loosening of public sector pay restraint should boost inflation, whatever issues it might raise for the public finances. Real-terms pay cuts, now being imposed across both public and private sectors, are, however, a drag on demand - at a time when the main threat to the British economy is recession, not inflation. </p> <p>They are also a self-inflicted political wound by the government, which is haemorrhaging support among millions of these mainly low-paid, women workers. If the result is, as expected, a rolling programme of strikes and disruption across public services, Brown and Darling will only have themselves to blame for yet another blow to their credibility.</p> <p>There were at least signs this week that ministers dimly recognise the direction they need to take, but in each case timidity immediately got the better of them. Brown acknowledged that social mobility had ground to a halt and said it was \"time to adapt and rethink New Labour policy\" - but then his spin doctors quickly insisted that didn't mean moving on from New Labour. Harriet Harman yesterday told the TUC that social background was the decisive, overarching form of inequality - but dropped the word \"class\" used in earlier media briefings like a hot potato. Darling blamed corporate executive bonuses as \"one of the major reasons for the global credit crunch\" - but later made clear that the only action being taken was a review by the Financial Services Authority, the body that oversaw the collapse of Northern Rock. That really should put the fear of God into the boardrooms.</p> <p>If today's energy measures are as trailed, they will deliver the same message of too little, too late. Cash for lagging lofts and insulating windows is welcome, but will do nothing for 5 million people in fuel poverty unable to heat their homes this winter. By failing to face down the energy companies over fuel bills, the sense that the prime minister had once again buckled before rampant corporate power caused despair in Brighton. Unless Brown is saving up something much bolder for Labour's conference in 10 days' time, his premiership is surely doomed.</p> <p>He does at least now have a breathing space. It was clear at the TUC that the imminent threat of a leadership challenge has evaporated, courtesy of David Miliband's premature move six weeks ago. To many Labour MPs and trade unionists, even Brown's dismal performance suddenly seemed more tolerable once it became clear that the Blairite foreign secretary was the only alternative on offer. Miliband's belligerent performance over the Georgian crisis - echoing the hawkish rhetoric from Washington - added to the sense he cannot represent the kind of break with the past 11 years that the government needs if it is to stage any kind of political comeback. </p> <p>In current economic conditions, only decisive action can make the difference. We are now in the bizarre situation where a neoconservative Republican US administration is taking far more radical measures than a British Labour government to combat the crisis: cutting interest rates, putting cash in people's pockets, intervening heavily in the financial markets, and now nationalising the country's two largest mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p>The scale of the market failure represented by the credit crunch and the breakdown of the neoliberal model should represent a huge opportunity for political parties of the left and the centre-left. The kind of policies advocated by the TUC this week - from tougher financial and utility regulation and lower VAT on energy bills, to minimum tax rates for the wealthy - could easily be picked up by the government. But although ministers privately acknowledge we have moved into \"different times\", they seem unable to draw the obvious conclusions. If Brown carries on stumbling towards the precipice, the pressure for another leader prepared to do just that is bound to re-emerge.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Train fares became simpler at the start of this week, as the rail industry merged a bewildering range of tickets into a straightforward choice between cheap tickets booked in advance and expensive ones sold at the station. But that sensible step forward may be soon followed by many greater steps back. Both in London and on the national network, regulators, rail operators and engineering firms are doing battle over an impending financial crunch that may make services worse, or more expensive, or possibly both. Hard though it is to believe, passengers may one day look back to 2008 as a golden age of affordable travel.</p> <p>This is particularly true in London, which faces a gap in funding for tube improvement of more than \u00a33bn, even before the cost of building the Crossrail link is factored in. At the core of the problem is the public-private partnership that Gordon Brown inflicted on London when he was chancellor, despite protests from Ken Livingstone. The idea was that the long-term job of renewing the tube would be split between two private groups, while the state ran services. But the cost of the work soared out of control. The bigger of the two, Metronet, went bust while the second, Tubelines, is being offered around \u00a32bn less than it wants for essential work between 2010-2017. Either the bill must be met, or less work will be done. The result, according to tube boss Tim O'Toole, would be that \"the tube will become less reliable and capacity will shrink\" - which means stations being shut down to prevent overcrowding and fewer trains to carry record numbers of passengers. </p> <p>He - and the uncertain administration of London's mayor Boris Johnson - want the Treasury to bridge the gap. But that looks unlikely; there is no spare money and London already gets a lot. Fares could go up: but there is a limit to how much they can be pushed. Meanwhile, the national rail network faces a similar dilemma, although the organisational structures are different. Network Rail wants \u00a31.8bn more than regulators are prepared to offer from next April. On Monday it published a long warning about the consequences. On top of that, state support is planned to start falling, with higher fares covering much more of the industry's costs. </p> <p>It would be easy to blame all this on privatisation. In London and nationally, systems are insanely complex, and dependent on a handful of private contractors. But undoing this would be expensive too. The answer must be to push down costs while continuing investment, perhaps issuing long-term bonds to pay the bill. And all this is assuming a recession does not lead to a collapse in fare revenue, which would make the black hole even worse.</p>",
  "<p>What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago Labour was soaring in the polls and all the talk was of a snap election. Today, the Tories are 15% ahead in the polls and all the pressure is on Gordon Brown. In the past year they have skilfully avoided any detailed consideration of exactly what a Cameron Tory government would do, because it does not form part of their strategy for winning the next election. </p> <p>That strategy has now become clear: first, detoxify the political brand - to give the impression that the party has changed and re-positioned itself on to the centre ground of British politics.</p> <p>Once this was achieved and the public no longer viewed the Tories as threatening and divisive, it then opened up the opportunity to make the next general election a referendum on Gordon Brown and his Labour government.</p> <p>As part of this strategy any policies must go with the grain of public opinion - as seen by the Tories. So nothing too radical, coupled with the objective of \"achieving progressive goals through Conservative means\".</p> <p>This then begs the question as to exactly what these progressive goals are going to be. Cameron has said that he wants to be as radical a social reformer as Margaret Thatcher was an economic reformer. But as the series of articles in the Guardian this week has revealed, there is a split in the Tory party on social issues that goes right to the top. </p> <p>George Osborne is happy to describe himself as a social liberal, whereas David Cameron is clearly a social conservative. Just consider his voting record in parliament: in support of retaining section 28; in favour of cutting the time limit for abortions; and in favour of wishing to deny IVF treatment to lesbian couples. His is not a social progressive agenda but one that has more to do with the past than the future. </p> <p>For Labour to have a chance of winning the next election, the fightback has to start now. A key part of this must be a reasoned but hard-hitting attack on Cameron and what he would do if elected. </p> <p>This should not be on the grounds that he is \"a toff\" or \"a shallow salesman\". This approach fails to recognise the attraction he has for many voters. Instead, we need to reveal the true instincts of Cameron and the inconsistencies at the heart of the modern Conservative party. </p> <p>This will shift the election away from a referendum on the Labour government and move it on to what the election actually is about - a choice about which party will govern our country for the next five years. </p> <p>The Tories have now become an effective opposition. They are clearly ready to fight an election. For Labour the challenge is to demonstrate that they are nowhere near being ready to hold office. </p> <p>Let us just take one example that goes to the heart of Cameron as a politician and as a party leader: his talk of \"achieving progressive goals through Conservative means\". </p> <p>Sensibly he hasn't attempted to give any detail as to what this would mean in practice. If he were to do so it would become clear that \"Conservative\" means simply \"cannot deliver the changes necessary to achieve progressive goals\". </p> <p>What it does show is that at heart Cameron is an old-style Conservative who is deeply uncomfortable with the state playing any role in our lives.</p> <p>I believe that now is the right time for a debate about the size and role of government: in particular, the need to establish a new relationship between citizens and the state. This is something that Cameron is trying to avoid. His is a dogmatic opposition to an active and enabling government. The talk around Cameron is of self-regulation, the promotion of social norms and peer-group pressure being the means by which people and companies can be \"nudged\" to do the right thing.</p> <p>This really is \"flopsy bunny\" stuff and bears no relation to the real world. No amount of \"nudging\" would have seen the introduction of the minimum wage, flexible working for parents, or the lifting of 600,000 children out of poverty. </p> <p>To achieve such progressive goals requires a strong and active government that will take on those vested interests that stand in the way of change.</p> <p>It is clear that for dogmatic reasons David Cameron will not accept this. It raises the question as to what a Cameron Tory government would actually see its role as being. At present it would appear to be one that would just stand to the side and allow individuals and communities to be the innocent victims of economic and social circumstances beyond their control.</p> <p>We have, of course, been there before under the Tories. David Cameron would be a Pontius Pilate prime minister, washing his hands of any responsibility. At a time of globalisation and of pressures at home and abroad, this is exactly the wrong direction to take our country.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stephen Byers is the Labour MP for North Tyneside <br><a href=\"mailto:byerss@parliament.uk\">byerss@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>What happened on September 11 2001, and what has happened since? The attack on the twin towers is now history but it is still history which we do not understand very well. Reactions at the time ran from the apocalyptic to the dismissive. Everything would soon be back to normal, said some. Nothing would ever be the same again, said others. </p> <p>Seven years later it can be said that both camps were right. Things did go back to normal, if by \"normal\" you include the casualty lists from Iraq and Afghanistan, and those from the terrorist attacks in Madrid, London, Bali and elsewhere. But such horrors, for Americans and Europeans at least, mingle now with the usual round of celebrity chatter, economic crisis, spring sales, endangered species, elections, new movies, road accidents, and food scares, just another part of the jangled wallpaper of our lives. </p> <p>Yet that there has been a profound change is undeniable, even if most of us, most of the time, do deny it. The bags with torches, water, first aid items and canned food stowed at the back of the cupboard or under the stairs in homes in Washington, London and Paris may have been long since unpacked. But a well-managed chemical, biological or nuclear attack could terribly damage or totally destroy any one of those cities, or any city in the world, at any moment. Those whose job it is contemplate these prospects on a daily basis pale at the thought, while the rest of us avert our eyes.</p> <p>A few of the terrorist attempts of the past seven years have been successful, but fortunately less than devastating. Most have been incompetent, and many have been detected and monitored by alert security forces, as the liquid bombs case has just reminded us. There is comfort here, but small comfort. Two curves on the graph chart the future. One is the curve of their competence, or even just their luck, as they would see it. The other is the curve of our competence, not only in the narrow sense of defending ourselves, but in the broader sense of changing the world in such a way that our enemies also change, embracing less vicious ways of achieving their objectives. </p> <p>A year or so ago the verdict on our performance would have been harsh: two bad wars, with a third one brewing, abrogations of the law and civil liberties that were as deplorable as they were ineffective, alienated minorities in many countries, and a relationship between the west and the Muslim world marked by misunderstanding and hostility. Today it might be a shade or two less withering. One war has lessened in its intensity, while the prospect of an American attack on Iran has dwindled. A general recognition that the Bush administration's violations of the law were counterproductive is evident across the political spectrum, even if it is also evident that ingenious new ways of circumventing the law are still being found. Second thoughts in some of the other 80 countries which have passed dubious counterterrorism legislation are emerging. Hard although it is to track, it may be that alienation among Muslim minorities in Europe is down, a product of efforts on both sides to improve understanding. </p> <p>Even the Bush administration has moved away from the idea of a \"war\" on terror. General Richard Myers, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in 2005 that \"if you call it a war, then you think of people in uniform being the solution\". Men like Robert Gates, the secretary of defence, and David Petraeus, the new head of the US Central Command, understand that principle very well. It is dismaying that John McCain, unlike Barack Obama, seems locked into the monolithic view of a single enemy and an ultimate military victory that others have rightly discarded. American voters in particular should grasp that our common engagement with terrorism is not a war. It is far more important than that.</p>",

There are lots of demos and tutorials on YouTube.</p> <h2><strong>Office upgrade</strong></h2> <p>I have Microsoft Office Professional 2000 and would like to know the cheapest legal way of upgrading to Office Professional 2007. I am not a student.</p> <p><strong>Bob Baker </strong></p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Microsoft's website says you can upgrade to Office Pro from Microsoft Works 6.0-10 or any 2000-2007 Microsoft Office program or suite except Office XP Student and Teacher (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0028\">bit.ly/aj0028</a>). You could therefore shop around for the Microsoft Office 2007 Professional Edition (Upgrade), which you can install on two computers - normally your desktop and your laptop. A slightly cheaper option is the OEM version coded MSOEM162. This is designed for original equipment manufacturers and PC system builders to sell with machines, and can only be installed on one PC. It is not necessarily suitable for consumers, bearing in mind that the OEM (in this case, you) also has to provide the support. OEM versions of software may also come without boxes, manuals, or even discs. </p> <h2><strong>Positively not Adobe</strong></h2> <p>I need to update Adobe Acrobat/Reader to read bulletins, but my attempt to download version 9 has been blocked because AVG Anti-virus (Free Edition 8.0.169) has detected Trojan horse Generic11.PWW.</p> <p><strong>Cyril Braganza</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Adobe says AVG has acknowledged that this is a \"false positive\" and it will be fixed in an update: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0027\">bit.ly/aj0027</a>.

This continues for as long as I leave the machine connected. AVG 8, Ad-Aware and Spybot have revealed nothing.</p> <p><strong>Robert Caldicott </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> You are right to be concerned because the unknown data traffic could be spam or worse, if your PC has been hacked. However, the most likely cause is Microsoft's Windows Update, which dribbles away in the background so as not to interfere with normal usage. Otherwise, your firewall should tell you which applications have your permission to access the internet, and which ones are active. Active processes should also be visible in the Windows Task Manager or the superior Process Explorer, a free download (bit.ly/aj0029). In your case, the culprit may be setupxv.exe, which could be malware or fake anti-spyware (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0030\">bit.ly/aj0030</a>).</p> <p>The web is another common source of unknown data traffic. Some pages refresh adverts or update their contents periodically without telling you, but this should stop if you close down all browsers.</p> <p>If you can't see what's sending traffic, you can try using a packet sniffer to capture and examine the data being transferred. Sadly, I use Wireshark (wireshark.org), which is not a simple option for beginners. There are alternatives listed at bit.ly/aj0031 and bit.ly/aj0032. SmartSniff looks easier to use (<a href=\"http://gn.apc.org\">bit.ly/aj0033</a>).</p> <h2><strong>Automatic backup</strong></h2> <p>Is there an external hard drive that is really automatic?</p> <p><strong>Michael Abraham</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Clickfree external hard drives are promoted as offering the \"first out-of-the-box automatic backup\" and can handle up to 10 PCs.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337483373\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Never before has such attention been focused on the click of a mouse. Yesterday, the click in question started up the biggest, most complicated machine in the world, the $10bn Large Hadron Collider, which was put through its paces for the first time at Cern, the European nuclear research organisation in Geneva.</p> <p>The man with his finger on the button was Lyn Evans, a Welsh engineer who has devoted 14 years of his life to the machine. The moment came at 8.32am UK time and was broadcast around the world, and via videolink to more than 300 journalists who had descended on the laboratory to witness the event.</p> <p>The LHC lies 100 metres beneath fields and farmland, where it occupies a 17-mile (27km) circular tunnel carved through rock and sandstone. </p> <p>When it is working at full speed, it will be the most powerful particle collider on the planet. Inside, it will crash subatomic particles together with enough energy to re-create the intense conditions that existed one trillionth of a second after the big bang. </p> <p>Yesterday, the scientists' ambitions were more modest. Before the machine can be put to work, its makers had to take it for a test drive. </p> <p>The goal was to send beams of protons around the collider's hollow ring in both directions, to make sure there were no obstructions and to check that powerful superconducting magnets surrounding the ring can steer the beams with exquisite precision. When Cern attempted this on an older, less powerful collider in 1996, it found two beer bottles stuck inside the ring.</p> <p>Yesterday, the tests went more smoothly than many scientists dared hope for. At 9.28am UK time, two spots flickered on to a screen in the control room, one spot caused by the beam on the way in, the other as it completed its first lap. Cheering, relieved scientists clapped and slapped each other on the back. The test had taken less than one hour. \"My first thought was one of relief. I'm too preoccupied at the moment to have emotions,\" said Evans, who later confessed to laying a bet with fellow physicist Steve Meyers, head of Cern's accelerator and beam operations, that he could get the beam to circulate within an hour.</p> <p>Moments after the test was declared successful, scientists in the control room cracked open bottles of champagne. </p> <p>Verena Kain, a physicist on the machine, said: \"I didn't believe it, I had to see it a second time. Everybody is just floating right now. It's a first step, but it's fantastic it works so well.\"</p> <p>By 2pm UK time, the scientists had sent a beam of protons around the machine in the opposite, anticlockwise direction to the first beam. </p> <p>David Evans, a physicist from the University of Birmingham, who works on one of the machine's giant detectors, said: \"It's gone so well I'm optimistic we can probably do low-energy collisions within days. We could be looking at high-energy collisions within weeks.\" Now the real work begins. Scientists will spend the coming days and weeks fine-tuning the machine and testing the four huge detectors, which will sift through the subatomic debris of the collisions for evidence of new physics. </p> <p>Tejinder Virdee, a physicist at Imperial College London and head of one of the LHC's detector groups, said: \"With the LHC, we will be able to look deeper into matter, and look further back in time than ever before. </p> <p>\"Particle physics is a modern name for the centuries-old effort to understand the laws of nature.\"</p> <p>Within weeks, the machine could produce particles of dark matter, a mysterious substance that stretches through the universe and clings around galaxies. The discovery would be profound.</p> <p>Astronomers know that normal matter, the stuff of stars and planets, makes up only 5% of the observable universe. Dark matter accounts for a further 25%, with the remaining 70% being the even more exotic dark energy, which drives the expansion of the cosmos.</p> <p>By creating a microcosm of the big bang, scientists hope the machine will explain how the forces of nature became what they are today. </p> <p>The machine will also hunt the famed Higgs boson, or \"God particle\". Named after Peter Higgs, an Edinburgh University physicist, the Higgs boson is crucial to understanding the origin of mass. </p> <p>Cern thought it had caught a glimpse of the Higgs particle before with its previous particle collider in 2000.</p> <p>It will now race against scientists at the American Fermilab, near Chicago, which is working around the clock to discover the particle first. \"This is a unique machine and it will certainly advance the knowledge of mankind. But we also know that pushing technology to the limit always has spinoffs. We don't know what the LHC will bring apart from wonderful science, but we're already working on a far more powerful system than the internet. Where we lead, others will follow,\" said Evans.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists are preparing to launch a new satellite to make more precise measurements of the Earth's gravitational field and so help improve predictions about global warming.</p> <p>The \u20ac330m (\u00a3265m) project aims to provide an extremely accurate map of the planet's gravitational field. Its main mission is to help climate scientists improve their predictions by enabling them to produce a more precise picture of the ocean currents.</p> <p>By comparing the surface shape of the oceans with the undulations in the gravitational field, scientists can arrive at a more accurate picture of the oceans' currents - the flows that transport vast amounts of heat around the planet and so have a profound impact on the global climate. </p> <p>The satellite will complete a map of the gravitational field once every 70 days and stay in operation for about 18 months. </p> <p>\"This isn't a scientific indulgence,\" Professor Marek Ziebart, of University College London, told this year's British Association Festival of Science, meeting in Liverpool. \"It's about predicting how the world is going to change.\"</p> <p>The torpedo-shaped satellite - known as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer - was due to launch this week from the Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 miles north of Moscow. But engineers delayed takeoff for two weeks after problems with the guidance and navigation system. </p> <p>The satellite, when launched, will orbit from pole to pole at an altitude of about 160 miles. This is very low for satellites, but it needs to be close to the Earth to be able to measure minute fluctuations in gravity - about 10 million-millionths of the gravity we feel on Earth. To measure these the engineers developed sophisticated control mechanisms that dampen other forces acting on the spacecraft, including buffeting by cosmic rays.</p> <p>\"Whether the ocean surface is sloped or not is a very sensitive indicator of what the currents are doing,\" said Chris Hughes, at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool. He said that just a one-centimetre difference in ocean height generated a current flow of 1m cubic metres a second. </p> <p>The gravitational reference map will also have other applications. Geologists will use the map as a set of reference points to measure movements during earthquakes, for example. It will also be useful for tweaking satellite orbits and accurately surveying land.</p>",
  "<p>A barrister shot by police officers at his luxury flat in Chelsea, London, died in a hail of 11 bullets after a siege lasting more than five hours, the high court was told yesterday.</p> <p>Mark Saunders was holding a gun at the time but did not appear to be aiming it at anyone and had not fired a shot for 20 minutes, lawyers for his sister Charlotte claimed. She is seeking a declaration that the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation into the incident is unlawful.</p> <p>Mr Justice Underhill was told that Saunders, a divorce lawyer, was killed at 9.30pm on May 6 when seven officers opened fire. But the family's legal team said it was unclear if he posed any \"imminent threat\", because other residents had been evacuated or were safely contained, the firearms officers were using ballistics shields and his gun was believed to contain only pellets for shooting game.</p> <p>\"As a consequence, it is difficult to see who was being put at risk or who the police may have believed was being put at risk by Mr Saunders' actions at the time when he was shot,\" Tim Owen QC said in his written argument put before the judge.</p> <p>He said it appeared from CCTV footage that negotiations or communications were continuing up to 10 seconds before Saunders was shot, but may have been impeded by the lack of a dedicated phone line and the noise of police helicopters. Officers were recorded repeatedly requesting that their own aircraft move away, Owen said.</p> <p>Saunders had fired at officers, neighbours and buildings with a legally owned shotgun from his \u00a32.2m flat. As the siege unfolded, he threw a message to his wife, Elizabeth, from a window, suggesting a row between the couple may have caused the incident. </p> <p>Charlotte Saunders, 26, has launched a landmark judicial review, alleging an unlawful failure to disclose sufficient information to her in the course of the IPCC investigation, and that allowing firearms officers to confer before making written statements meant they could have colluded to produce a false account. </p> <p>Owen told the court the issue was whether the accepted practice, which he said created a \"substantial risk of collusion and of contamination\", was compatible with European human rights laws. </p> <p>\"It is calculated to produce evidence which is tainted by the obvious risk of collusion, by which I mean a deliberate construction of a false account,\" he said. Even if it was not tainted it would be unreliable because it would be the product of contamination, Owen added.</p> <p>\"On the facts of the claimant's case the risk is substantial. The officers were not separated before their accounts were obtained. The opportunity to confer and therefore the risk of collusion was increased by a number of events. There was a delay in providing initial statements. The Metropolitan police commissioner has now admitted that there was in fact conferring between the officers.\" </p> <p>He said the IPCC had provided further opportunity to do so by organising meetings to tell groups of officers what further information was needed from them. </p> <p>Charlotte Saunders said before the court hearing that the family had been given so little information by the IPCC that they had relied on stories in the media. </p> <p>Police should not automatically be trusted to have acted correctly when people had been shot dead, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I don't think they should always be given the benefit of the doubt. Surely that is the point of an independent investigation. And that they are not immediately interviewed, they are given the opportunity to speak to each other and accounts are written down - that is not the same as immediately accounting for yourself verbally.\" </p> <p>Asked whether she was vengeful after the death of her brother, she said: \"Of course we are a grieving family and it is a horrendous shock, but equally I am sure that other alternatives could have been used to save his life that day, and I just don't believe that it was absolutely essential to take his life, bearing in mind that the area had been closed, contained and seemingly nobody was really in danger.</p> <p>\"I have to question whether it was necessary to kill my brother.\"</p> <p>The practice of allowing officers to confer is contained in the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) manual on the use of firearms. The IPCC will argue at the hearing that until Acpo orders a change in practice, it can do nothing. </p> <p>\"We don't accept that argument,\" Owen said. \"The IPCC is invested with sufficient powers to make a direction to the police authority to reverse the current practice to achieve a different approach which is capable of being compatible.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Stop winding up fears</strong></h2> <p>While we cannot disagree that there are some problems with a small number of wind turbines worldwide, I felt that the article was written to support the anti-wind faction in the UK (Spinning to destruction, September 4). A number of the facts stated in the article were either incorrect or misleading. The issue of the location of a planned turbine in Bradford some 300ft from residential housing: this is 100 metres and the minimum that can be considered for the placement of wind turbines to housing in the UK is 600 metres (about 1,800 feet). Second, you state that most turbines turn at 25rpm: early turbines turned at this speed but most turbines turn between 12rpm and 15rpm. In \u00c5rhus, the blade did not come loose: the turbine lost computer control and it went over-speed, causing the blade to hit the tower. Any of the issues related to wind turbine failure are due to storms and extreme winds. I think the scare tactic you have used is misleading and without true merit.</p> <p><strong>Jamie R Mathlin,</strong> Great Torrington </p> <p>\u00b7 Any new energy technology will have teething troubles, but for wind power, it's mostly confined to a few broken turbines on remote hillsides.

It doesn't talk about the dangerous effects of wind farms' pulsating noise on people's health and sleep.

  "<p>Six Greenpeace climate change activists have been cleared of causing \u00a330,000 of criminal damage at a coal-fired power station in a verdict that is expected to embarrass the government and lead to more direct action protests against energy companies.</p> <p>The jury of nine men and three women at Maidstone crown court cleared the six by a majority verdict. Five of the protesters had scaled a 200-metre chimney at Kingsnorth power station, Hoo, Kent, in October last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337506384\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/GordonChimney.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsnorth chimney\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace activists on the painted chimney October 8 2008. Photograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists admitted trying to shut down the station by occupying the smokestack and painting the word \"Gordon\" down the chimney, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world. It was the first case in which preventing property damage caused by climate change had been used as part of a \"lawful excuse\" defence in court. It is now expected to be used more widely by environment groups. </p> <p>In his summing-up at the end of an eight-day trial, the judge, David Caddick, said the case centred on whether or not the protesters had a lawful excuse for their actions. He told the jury that for this defence to be used it had to be proved that the action was due to an immediate need to protect property belonging to another.</p> <p>He said allowance for demonstrations did not extend to breaking the law and the jury's task was to examine the boundary line represented by the lawful excuse and to evaluate whether the defendants had crossed the line. He also warned the jury to put aside any feelings towards Greenpeace, climate change or fuel companies during their deliberations. </p> <p>John Price, prosecuting, had earlier argued that the protesters' actions were \"not capable of being lawful\". He said: \"There are things you can lawfully do in making a protest but there's a line which has to be drawn. When the defendants caused damage to that chimney, it's the line that they crossed.\"</p> <p>The court had heard from Professor Jim Hansen, one of the world's leading climate scientists, that the 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. Hansen, a Nasa director who advises Al Gore, the former US presidential candidate turned climate change campaigner, told the court that humanity was in \"grave peril\". \"Somebody needs to step forward and say there has to be a moratorium, draw a line in the sand and say no more coal-fired power stations.\"</p> <p>It also heard David Cameron's environment adviser, millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith, and an Inuit leader from Greenland both say climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. Goldsmith told the court: \"By building a coal-power plant in this country, it makes it very much harder [to exert] pressure on countries like China and India\" to reduce their burgeoning use of the fossil fuel.</p> <p>The court was told that some of the property in immediate need of protection included parts of Kent at risk from rising sea levels, the Pacific island state of Tuvalu and areas of Greenland. The defendants also cited the Arctic ice sheet, China's Yellow River region, the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica, coastal areas of Bangladesh and the city of New Orleans.</p> <p>The jury was told that Kingsnorth emitted the same amount of carbon dioxide as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined - and that there were advanced plans to build a new coal-fired power station next to the existing site on the Hoo peninsula.</p> <p>Greenpeace used the court's decision to put pressure on the government to abandon plans for a new generation of coal-fired plants. \"Today's acquittal is a potent challenge to the government's plans for new coal-fired stations from jurors representing ordinary people in Britain who, after hearing the evidence, supported the right to take direct action in order to protect the climate,\" said Ben Stewart, the group's communications director and one of the six acquitted. The others were Will Rose, Kevin Drake, Tim Hewke, Huw Williams and Emily Hall.</p> <p>\"It wasn't only us in the dock, it was coal-fired power generation as well,\" said Hall. \"The only people left in Britain who think new coal is a good idea are business secretary John Hutton and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks. It's time the prime minister stepped in and embraced a clean energy future for Britain.\"</p> <h2>Winning causes</h2> <p>In the last 12 years, court cases involving GM crops and nuclear, chemical and arms companies collapsed after protesters said they had followed their consciences and had been trying to prevent a greater crime.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>2000</strong> Norwich jury found Greenpeace director Lord Melchett and 27 activists not guilty of causing criminal damage to field of GM crops</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>2000</strong> Five Greenpeace volunteers found not guilty of criminal damage after occupying incinerator </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1999</strong> Three women cleared of causing \u00a380,000 damage to Trident nuclear submarine computer equipment</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1996</strong> Liverpool jury acquitted four women who caused \u00a31.5m damage to Hawk fighter jet at British Aerospace factory</p>",
  "<p>For cyclists, at least, TS Eliot got it wrong: September is the cruellest month (though April also had its sadistic side in this freakishly torrential year). The evenings are drawing in, the air is cooling down, making it oh-so-tempting to abandon the bike for the winter.</p> <p>The solution, I've always thought, is to adopt the school calendar and think of it as the beginning rather than the end of the year - January, after all, is merely the middle of the misery season, unless you happen to have been given a new bike for Christmas. One of the consolations of going back to school was the pencil case full of shiny new protractors and sharpened pencils. Likewise, in cycling, it's a good time to stock up on all those little necessities that will make life tolerable through the grisly months ahead. A stout pair of gloves will go a long way to convincing you that it's not really that punishingly cold, while it's a sound strategy to anticipate the lengthening nights by stocking up with working lights (and spare batteries), so that you don't arrive at the end of a day's work with a ready-made excuse not to attempt the ride home.</p> <p>Lights are my weakness. Leave them on and they get nicked; take them off and you either forget them or - most irritatingly of all - they self-activate in your bag so that when you come to switch them on, all you get is a feeble flicker. What you really shouldn't attempt to do is to ride home in the dark without them, even though the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents points out that cyclists statistically have more accidents in daylight, making daytime conspicuousness just as important. Time to treat yourself to that hi-vis jacket.</p> <p>More contentious than lights are helmets and bells. The fact that 20-40% of your body heat is lost through the top of your head makes a good case for investing in headwear for warmth, even if you don't buy the safety arguments, which I certainly do. Though I rather fancy a new hooter, I'm more ambivalent about bells, after a summer of experimenting on old ladies and joggers in my local park. Old ladies tend to panic and lurch in the wrong direction, while most joggers are plugged into iPods, so don't hear you anyway.</p> <p>This ambivalence is reflected in recent legislative history: bells were obligatory until Thatcher's government scrapped the requirement in 1983. They became compulsory again at point of sale in 2004, though - as staff at my bike shop pointed out - one leading manufacturer until recently supplied bikes with bells that didn't fit, and it's perfectly legal for cycle shops to remove bells from bikes that they've sold, as it's not illegal for the owner to ride without one if they so wish. Guide Dogs for the Blind, however, says it wants the legislation to be extended because the commonest form of road accidents for blind people are with silent bikes.</p> <p>You've got the gadgets, so what else can you do to cheer yourself on? You could try a cycling version of the detox, which involves taking a good look at the bad habits you've acquired over the year and taking action to correct them. One of the simplest steps is to make sure your saddle is the right height (Transport for London research this summer suggested that 71% of the city's cyclists are riding badly fitting bikes). The DIY version is to measure your inside leg, subtract 10cm and then match it to the length between the top of your saddle and the point where the pedal is attached to the bike frame. Or you could book an appointment with the Covent Garden-based ergonomics specialist Cyclefit, whose two-hour sessions will set you back \u00a3175, but will tell you everything you need to know about what you're doing wrong. </p> <p>I'm not sure I need to know too much about power leakage and biomechanical inefficiency. On the other hand there's that creak in my left knee which always seems worse when it's cold and wet. And I do strongly believe that a comfortable cyclist is a regular cyclist, come cataracts or hurricanes.</p>",
  "<p>Can Opec defend an oil price of $100 a barrel? Yesterday the cartel, after its meeting in Vienna, seemed to signal that it wants to try. A cut in production of 500,000 barrels a day is tiny (about 0.6% of global production) but the tone of the communique was hawkish - it described the oil market as over-supplied. That sounded like a threat to reduce production further, through the formal mechanism of quotas, if prices continue to fall. </p> <p>Yet the price of a barrel of Brent barely budged; it was back below $100 by the afternoon. The market clearly doubts Opec's ability to put a floor under prices after the fall from July's peak of $147. Consumption in the US fell sharply over the summer; autumn is traditionally the slow season for oil; and colder economic breezes are reaching Asia, source of the growth in demand for oil. So maybe Opec's stance was weaker than it appeared - after all, the heavy gun of quota cuts wasn't rolled out.</p> <p>Predicting the oil market is a mug's game. A year ago, the idea that prices might soon hit $147 a barrel seemed silly. It seems equally likely that prices could overshoot on the way down - especially as Opec has advertised its concern that global recession will destroy demand. That's not a position of strength.</p> <p><strong>Lehman bravado</strong></p> <p>It's a miracle. Lehman Brothers doesn't need new capital or new investors.</p> <p>The message was not the one Wall Street was expecting to hear. Nor was it simple. It seems that the sale of a 55% stake in the investment management business, plus a spin-off of the poisonous commercial property assets into a separate vehicle, can allow a \"core\" Lehman to emerge. There was an odd-looking goodwill write-back in there to help the calculations but you get the picture: Lehman thinks it can muddle through in a slimmed-down version.</p> <p>Chief executive Dick Fuld claimed his staff (the ones who are left) are \"holding wonderfully\" and that clients are supportive. He has to say that, but the harsh reality is that a wounded investment bank is a vulnerable creature on Wall Street. Rivals pick off top talent and a shrinking bank finds itself with less financial firepower. A takeover looks the most likely outcome.</p> <p><strong>Hedged in</strong></p> <p>Investors in RAB Capital's Special Situations hedge fund thought life was bad last week, when they were told that the value of their investment was down 37.5% this year. Yesterday, after adding up the latest numbers and reviewing the unlisted portfolio, RAB told them that the fall is now 48%.</p> <p>Cue a rush for the exit, you might assume. But RAB wants to bolt the door. It is asking investors, who include the steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, to agree to lock up their money for three years. In return, it will reduce its fees.</p> <p>The lock-in proposal may well succeed. Philip Richards, the fund's manager, is best known for his bad bet on Northern Rock, but his fund is really stuffed with small mining and resource stocks. Selling these into a falling commodity market risks instantly turning a 48% loss into something much worse. Thus the invitation to ride the downturn and await the upturn. The fund's wealthy backers (minimum investment: $50,000) may well look kindly on Richards' long-term record (a 17-fold return since 2003, even after this year's shocker) and let him carry on. </p> <p>But RAB's woes also reveal the wider ones of the battalion of hedge funds operating in the commodity field. Investors, having enjoyed the boom, want out. US manager Ospraie has pulled the plug of one of its big commodity funds. The providers of hedge funds' debt, the investment banks, don't want another black hole to appear and are imposing tougher terms. We're seeing a spiral of selling, and it shows no sign yet of slowing. Expect more casualties.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>A soldier who killed a comrade by shooting him in the head as he messed around with a sniper's rifle in Iraq was yesterday sent to a military detention centre but was not dismissed from the army. </p> <p>Rifleman Aarron Kendrick, 20, was playing with a colleague's rifle in a bunkroom at Basra palace in July last year when he pointed the weapon at fellow soldier Edward Vakabua, who was sleeping in his bunk. Believing the weapon was unloaded, Kendrick pulled the trigger and shot Vakabua, 23, in the head. Colleagues fought to save the Fijian, who had recently been commended for bravery, but he was pronounced dead moments later. </p> <p>Kendrick, of 4th Battalion The Rifles, was convicted of manslaughter after a three-day court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire. Judge advocate Jack Bayliss sentenced him to two years and said he would spend 16 months in the military corrective training centre at Colchester, Essex. </p> <p>Colonel Patrick Sanders, then Kendrick's commanding officer, told the hearing yesterday that Kendrick had shown great remorse and had been forgiven by Vakabua's mother. </p> <p>He said: \"When the battalion returned from Iraq, Kendrick was keen to meet and spend time with Rifleman Vakabua's mother after we'd flown her to the UK from Fiji. In the course of an emotionally charged and intensely difficult meeting, Kendrick showed deep remorse and contrition and begged Mrs Vakabua for forgiveness. She in turn showed extraordinary Christian spirit and embraced him and forgave him.\"</p> <p>Sanders described the difficult conditions the soldiers were working in. He said in seven weeks of action the battalion had eight men killed in action and more than 40 wounded. The threat to the base in Basra palace was \"exceptionally high\".</p> <p>The judge told Kendrick: \"Contrary to all your training, you picked up a weapon with which you had little familiarity. You should not have done so. You failed to check the state of the weapon, you did not see if there was a round in the chamber or if a magazine was fitted. Your final and culpable act was pointing the weapon at a soldier lying on his bunk on the other side of your room and pulling the trigger.</p> <p>\"You were told from your very early days in the army that you never point a gun at anybody in jest. It was a dangerous and reckless act that cost another young man his life.\"</p> <p>The judge said normally a soldier would be automatically dismissed at the end of his sentence, but Kendrick's commanding officer could make the case for him to stay if he saw fit. </p> <p>Kendrick, who had been in the army for 18 months when he opened fire on his colleague, would have to move regiment if he remained in the army. The court martial heard Kendrick was not qualified to use the L96 sniper rifle and had no idea it was loaded as he played with it in the cramped bunkroom in June last year. </p> <p>Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, said: \"He cocked the rifle and pointed it in the direction of Rifleman Vakabua, who was lying on his bed having a nap. He put his finger on the trigger and pulled the trigger, discharging one round which shot Rifleman Vakabua in the head and killed him.\" </p> <p>Giving evidence, Kendrick said: \"I squeezed the trigger and there was a bang. I thought 'What the fuck?' I dropped the weapon. I remember running up to Rifleman Vakabua and that's as far as I remember.\" </p> <p>Vakabua, from Suva, Fiji, was hailed a hero shortly before his death for his role in saving a wounded colleague. </p> <p>He was manning a vulnerable rooftop observation post in Basra when it suffered a direct hit from a mortar, severely injuring a fellow soldier. He braved intense mortar fire after he volunteered to drive the man to a helicopter landing site for evacuation to hospital. </p> <p>In a statement released after he had been sentenced, Kendrick said he would carry his guilt with him for the rest of his life. He said: \"My actions resulted in the death of my friend and comrade Edward Vakabua. I have asked Edward's mother for her forgiveness. </p> <p>\"I am ashamed that my handling of the weapon resulted in Edward's death and I will carry that responsibility for the rest of my life.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tim Piggott-Smith, actor</strong><br>There was an incident 10 years ago in The Iceman Cometh, one Saturday night at half past nine. I'd been on stage for hours. I was doing a scene with Kevin Spacey, and it was around that time I noticed that mobiles were becoming a real, consistent problem. A phone went off. I didn't know where I was, and I said, \"If that goes off again I'll fucking kill you\" - it was the shock of being dragged into the real world. </p> <p>Kevin Spacey's way of handling it was much better. A phone once went off at the Old Vic, and he turned to the person in the audience and said, \"Tell them we're busy.\" </p> <p><strong>Richard Herring, comedian</strong><br>I was doing an Edinburgh show, the first time I'd done a show on my own, and as I got on stage a phone started ringing. I got through my first five jokes and the phone was still ringing. I had to stop and say, \"Whose phone is that - can you turn it off?\" I felt so flustered. The stage manager found it in the pocket of the person who was denying it. I threw it on to the stage to make a point and it fell into its constituent parts. There was a gasp, followed by a standing ovation. It wasn't an attempt to get angry. The minute you lose control as a performer, you're in dangerous waters. </p> <p>When I was starting out, I had much less control over my temper. Once I was doing a story about Rasputin, set to the music of Boney M, and I came down off the stage offering to fight some bloke. We had lost the audience by then. That was in 1992. </p> <p>On stage, your passions have risen and you're much more likely to do something extreme. As a comedian, you sometimes go down a dark alley, and make it worse before making it better. You have to make the response proportional. If you're too harsh, you lose the audience. </p> <p>Certainly it's affected by what's going on in your life outside, whether you're tense about something else. I'm not a brave or aggressive person in real life, but being on stage gives you a feeling of invulnerability.</p> <p><strong>Philip Hensher, novelist</strong><br>Everyone hates mobile phones going off, and I just stop dead in the middle of a sentence and stare at them until they stop. Once I was at a reading in Sydney, and someone put up her hand and asked how I could have given the Booker prize to Peter Carey for True History of the Kelly Gang (I was a judge in 2001), because no woman could like it. I had a total fit, because I hate the idea that a book is written exclusively for either a man or a woman. Everyone was looking nervously at me. No one asked any more questions; they all sat on their hands. I'm not usually a rage-filled person. </p> <p><strong>Louise Doughty, novelist</strong><br>It was my first ever reading, in 1995, on a panel with Liz Jensen, Kate Atkinson and Nick Hornby. Most people were there to see Nick. I was reading just before him, and a woman rolled her eyes and mouthed, really obviously, \"Oh, come on.\" To this day I regret the fact that I didn't crack. What I really wanted to say was, \"Madam, would you like to come up here and have a go?\" - but I was too timid. If anyone did that now, I would react pretty swiftly. Most novelists are shy and retiring people; when we get up and read, we're like badgers who have to come up from our burrows and do a tap dance. </p> <p><strong>Brendon Burns, comedian</strong><br>People confuse us with happy-clappy clowns, but some comedians are big, tough guys. You're the alpha male in that situation, and invariably there will be some guy in the audience who has had too much to drink and feels threatened. It makes you wonder why they came. </p> <p>I'm not a confrontational act, I'm just empathetic. I'll match the mood of the room and make it bigger. But sometimes I see red. When I get angry, I become lucid and eloquent. At one gig, I spent 20 minutes laying into the same guy. I was doing a routine about Scousers. You can make jokes about any town in England except Liverpool, which is ironic, because they think they've got a great sense of humour. Anyway, some horrible moon-faced Wayne Rooney lookalike took issue with me. He went to jump the barrier, and I told security to let him go. I didn't care, he was tiny.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Motion, poet laureate</strong><br>Public readings are floating worlds - there's a strange disparity between what you're saying and how it's understood, because people come with their own preconceptions and prejudices. I've not experienced rage, but have felt puzzlement bordering on dismay and disappointment at discovering that several of the things I have said have been massively misunderstood. You must grow another layer of skin, or become accepting. </p> <p>There's the common irritation of having to cope with mobile phones ringing, people arriving late or, worse, leaving early. For paranoid reasons, you think they're not having a good time, rather than having a coughing fit. </p> <p><strong>Benedict Cumberbatch, actor</strong><br>Good on Lee Hurst. I think that's completely valid for a man performing on his own. But comedy is a bit different: you're not subscribing to that fiction of a divide between performer and audience. Personally, I think stopping a theatre performance to tell the audience off is a bit toe-curling, because audiences are self-regulating. At the press night of [Martin Crimp's] The City at the Royal Court this year, someone's phone went off for four minutes. There was a moment when [co-star] Hattie Morahan broke off, and I thought about stopping and saying, \"OK everyone, we're only 20 minutes in, so we're going to ask that the phone be turned off and we're going to start again.\" I had this speech all ready, but I was repressing it and repressing it. </p> <p>Another night, someone shouted out, \"That was absolutely awful!\" at the end of the play, in the darkness after the lights went down. What annoyed me was that the audience had been sitting in silence at the end of this very puzzling play, and then someone decided to hijack their entire thought process. Of course, that's the danger of doing something live, and it shouldn't be sanitised - but it is a balance. </p> <p><strong>Meat Loaf, singer </strong><br>I was a little upset at an outdoor show at Castle Howard in Yorkshire this summer - not at the crowds but at the promoters, because the video screens weren't up and they were in the contract. I went to the production manager and said, \"This is ridiculous.\" There were more than 10,000 people there. </p> <p>When I took the stage I was pretty mad and swearing, but I used it in the performance. I'd seen Meryl Streep on Jonathan Ross talking about Kramer v Kramer. During filming, Dustin Hoffman turned around and slapped her in the face as hard as he could. She got really angry, but she used it. Similarly, my anger became part of the songs.</p> <p><strong>Scott Capurro, comedian</strong><br>In Edinburgh this year, I had people walk on stage and chest-butt me - twice - but generally, I'm lucky. My accent and my height make people a little shy. Although I'm skinny and queer, I think the audience believes that because of my material, I'm capable of anything. And I'm American, so I might be armed. Have I ever behaved badly to an audience? Yes, but my abuse is always verbal. When an audience resists me, I get angry. I become accusatory and absolutely filthy, just so they can get a taste of what really distasteful material is like. Then they've got something to complain about.</p> <p><strong>Jim Jeffries, comedian</strong><br>There are so many things an audience can do to get under your skin. There might be someone heckling very quietly in the front row, so you can hear it but the rest of the audience can't. Or you might see somebody filming the set, that little light on the phone following you around. It always seems a bit petty to ask them to stop. </p> <p>Sometimes people throw things at the stage, even at good gigs. That's why all comedy clubs have plastic glasses. The British really aren't responsible enough to drink out of glasses; we're the only country that uses \"glass\" as a verb. One Christmas at Jongleurs I got hit by a turkey kebab. </p> <p><strong>Wendy Cope, poet</strong><br>It was the early 1990s, not long after the publication of my second book, Serious Concerns, which does have more angry poems about men than any of my others. A lady came up to me at a reading and said, \"Three of my friends left their husbands after they read your book.\" I said, \"Gosh, I hope they made the right decision.\" I was alarmed. Mostly I find audiences warm and generous. But occasionally a man has been brought along who doesn't know what to expect, and thinks I'm very anti-man. It's annoying, but I don't get wound up by hostile questions. I try to respond in a humorous way. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Interviews by Paul Arendt, Anita Sethi and Dave Simpson</p>",
  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell is no stranger to the Guardian's executive pay survey. The boss of the world's second largest advertising group was one of the pioneers of share-based performance plans in the 1990s and having clocked up over 20 years at the helm, he has seen several of these mammoth schemes pay out. He last topped the pay league in 2005 with a package worth \u00a353m. </p> <p>The maturing of the latest three-year share scheme - called the \"leadership equity acquisition plan\" or \"Leap\" - has catapulted him to the top of this year's table with a pay packet worth more than \u00a323m. This means that Sorrell's accumulated pay over the past five years tops \u00a380m. WPP is Sorrell's empire and Sorrell's vision. Having quit as finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - the epitome of a 1980s advertising firm - in 1985, Sorrell alighted on a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets as the basis for realising his dream of building a global marketing services firm. Wire and Plastic Products - which has branched out in to a range of bathroom and kitchen accessories - is still part of the company, but Sorrell used its listing on the London Stock Exchange as a springboard for a series of acquisitions that created a company now worth more than \u00a35.7bn.</p> <p>His first big deal, in 1987, was a $566m swoop on J Walter Thompson, home to the eponymous ad agency as well as a public relations firm, Hill and Knowlton. He followed that up with the acquisition of the Ogilvy Group for $864m two years later and although his dealmaking took WPP perilously close to collapse in the 1990s, he pulled it back from the brink to snatch Young &amp; Rubicam at the height of the dotcom boom. WPP now employs more than 110,000 people and last year generated revenues of more than \u00a36bn.</p> <p>Despite being 63, Sorrell shows little signs of wanting to hand over the reins of the business. This year has seen him gatecrash market research firm TNS's cosy nil-premium merger with its German rival GfK. After approaching the TNS board three times with his own counter-offer, Sorrell has gone hostile and put his \u00a31.1bn cash-and-shares bid direct to shareholders.</p> <p>Success would help WPP regain the position it held earlier this decade and leapfrog Omnicom into first place in the advertising market. Analysts believe the deal makes sense as WPP lacks scale in the market research sector. As a result of Sorrrell's aggressive move, GfK and TNS pulled their merger and the German company last week gave up trying to get the cash together for its own full-scale bid, leaving Sorrell's bid as the only viable offer on the table.</p> <h2>Bart Becht</h2> <p>As well as being one of the highest paid chief executives on the FTSE 100, Becht, who runs Reckitt Benckiser, also manages to maintain one of the lowest profiles. Born in Rotterdam, he was been at the Dutch firm Benckiser since 1988, becoming chief executive in 1995 and leading the merger with British company Reckitt &amp; Colman four years later. He has focused the business on \"power brands\" including Harpic, Cillit Bang, Dettol, Nurofen and Vanish. In 2007 it made profits of close to \u00a31.2bn, a 39% increase on the year before. Even with that performance, his enormous salary has not escaped criticism. The fund management group F&amp;C picked out his pay as one of the most contentious issues of the year in its 2007 Responsible Investment Report.</p> <h2>Bob Diamond</h2> <p>An ardent Chelsea fan, Bob Diamond is a former teacher who has shot to prominence in the banking industry and as president of Barclays has become one of the highest paid executives on the board of major company. One of nine children, Diamond grew up in Concord, Massachusetts. After following his parents into teaching, he became a bond trader at investment bank Morgan Stanley, and later joined Credit Suisse. In 1996 he joined Barclays when it was battling to restructure its troubled investment banking arm, but was not appointed to the board until 2005 when his pay became public for the first time. This year his total pay is boosted further by a \u00a314.8m \"retained incentive opportunity\" based on three-year performance targets.</p> <h2>Mick Davis</h2> <p>Known in the mining industry as \"Big Mick\" and regarded by many as \"punchy\", Davis has built Xstrata from a small Swiss company worth \u00a3250m into one of the biggest natural resources groups in the world. Davis, aged 50, was finance director of BHP Billiton but quit when he failed to secure the top job at the mining business. He assumed control of Xstrata in 2001, raised \u00a31bn through a floation in London a year later and went about acquiring assets at breakneck speed, developing a reputation for the company as one of the most aggressive in the sector. Davis has donned the tin hat again this year in a \u00a35bn hostile takeover bid for Lonmin. His pay package adds up to a total of \u00a313.95m.</p> <h2>Stanley Fink</h2> <p>One of the best known figures in the hedge fund industry, Fink is appearing among the ranks of the best paid FTSE directors for the last time, at least for now. After 21 years at Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, Fink quit the business in July to spend more time on charitable work and other commercial interests. He bowed out on a high as the firm reported profits of $2bn (\u00a31.13bn). As well as being among the highest paid directors in the FTSE he owns shares in Man valued at around \u00a360m when he left. Fink, 50, is chairman of the Evelina Children's Hospital appeal and ARK (Absolute Return for Kids), a children's charity supported by hedge fund managers. He also sponsors a city academy school, Burlington Danes.</p> <h2>Tom Glocer</h2> <p>Glocer, 48, was the first person without a background in journalism to take the top job at Reuters, as well as the first American to run the news and financial information group, when he took over as chief executive in 2001. He managed to hang on to the top job after agreeing an \u00a38.7bn takeover of the company by Canadian rival Thomson last year. This year his salary will be boosted by a \u00a327m windfall from the takeover. Glocer has a degree in political philosophy from Columbia University and a graduate law degree from Yale Law School - he was a lawyer advising on mergers and acquisitions before joining Reuters in 1993 as deputy counsel for Reuters America. He is married to a former Miss Finland and they have two children.</p>",
  "<p>Two goals from Serhiy Nazarenko and another from Andriy Shevchenko brought<strong> Ukraine</strong> a 3-1 away win against <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>. They join England in having six points from their first two Group Six matches.</p> <p>Ukraine, who beat Belarus 1-0 last Saturday, asserted themselves from the start but did not score until shortly before half-time when midfielder Nazarenko headed in the rebound after Yevgen Seleznov hit a post. </p> <p>Andriy Shevchenko doubled the lead eight minutes after the break before Kazakhstan pulled one back through Sergey Ostapenko in the 70th minute. But Nazarenko put the result beyond doubt 10 minutes later.</p> <p><strong>Andorra</strong> briefly threatened a surprise when a penalty from Marc Pujol put them level at 1-1 against <strong>Belarus</strong> midway through the second half in Andorra La Vella. However, goals from Vitali Rodionov, converting from Alexander Hleb's pass, and substitute Vyacheslav Hleb wrapped up a 3-1 win for the visitors.</p> <p>In Group Four, <strong>Germany </strong>needed a hat-trick from Miroslav Klose to scrape a draw against <strong>Finland </strong>in Helsinki. The visitors were behind three times but on each occasion the Bayern Munich striker pulled them level. </p> <p>Jonatan Johansson opened the scoring, exploiting the Germany defence's failure to clear to beat goalkeeper Robert Enke. Five minutes later Klose replied after Sami Hyypia failed to control a pass. Finland regained the lead two minutes before half-time when Mika Vayrynen converted Daniel Sjolund's pass but two minutes later Klose seized on a mistake by goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen to make it 2-2. Sjolund's header gave Finland the lead for the third time but Klose earned Germany a point, bundling the ball in after a goalmouth scramble. </p> <p>In the same group <strong>Lichtenstein</strong>, Wales' next opponents, earned a rare point, drawing 0-0 away to <strong>Azerbaijan</strong></p> <p>In Group Nine <strong>Holland</strong> won 2-1 in <strong>Macedonia</strong>, a header from John Heitinga and venomous drive from Rafael van der Vaart in the second half setting up victory.</p> <p>Goals from Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka guided <strong>France</strong> to a 2-1 win over <strong>Serbia </strong>in Paris, easing some of the pressure on coach Raymond Domenech after last Saturday's defeat by Austria. Branislav Ivanovic pulled one back for Serbia with 14 minutes left.</p> <p>The biggest surprise came in Zurich, where <strong>Luxembourg </strong>beat <strong>Switzerland </strong>2-1, Alphonse Leweck's goal securing a stunning victory for the visitors four minutes from time.</p>",
  "<p>The sheer joy was mightier than even the achievement of wrecking Croatia's proud unbeaten record of 35 qualifying matches at home. With Theo Walcott's first goals for his country packaged as a hat-trick, this was the most uncanny result for England since the 5-1 trouncing of Germany in 2001. In his first fixture of genuine significance, Fabio Capello has awakened immense expectations. Perhaps he is also the man to meet them.</p> <p>Croatia were left short-staffed by a red card for Robert Kovac in the 51st minute, when England were only one ahead, but his offence was born of an inability to cope with these piratical visitors. His elbow to the head of Joe Cole left the Chelsea midfielder so bloodied and dazed that he had to be replaced by Jermaine Jenas. The damage done to Croatia in their World Cup campaign will take far longer to heal.</p> <p>They enjoyed nothing more than an irrelevant goal from Mario Mandzukic and even that was not permitted to go unpunished. Within four minutes Wayne Rooney was sending Walcott through to roll home his third goal and complete the scoring. The 19-year-old had become the contemporary version of Michael Owen on that occasion in Munich, ending the seven-year vigil for a hat-trick by an England player in a competitive match.</p> <p>How foolish it now seems that there was questioning of Capello's decision that Owen, in semi-fit condition for Newcastle United, would not be required in Zagreb. Who supposed that Rooney would find the net again for his country after 11 months of frustration?</p> <p>Capello will hear only praise, but he is unlikely to dwell on it. England, after all, did not proceed from Munich to lift the World Cup. With this outcome he has simply done the maximum possible so far.</p> <p>His legend was not in particular need of burnishing but Walcott's goals make the Italian look a magus of a manager for England, although it is the skills of players that are truly decisive. There were confident showings in all areas of the team last night, with the centre-backs Rio Ferdinand and John Terry, for instance, authoritative under pressure.</p> <p>It is goals that hold the richest promise of fulfilment. Walcott put England in front although the opportunity had its random element, with Danijel Pranjic clearing a Rooney pass and smacking the ball into the back of his team-mate Robert Kovac. Possession dropped to Walcott and from a tight angle on the right the Arsenal player found the far corner. Soon he was learning that prominence has its unpleasant consequences as, seven minutes from half-time, Josip Simunic inflicted a professional foul for which he was booked.</p> <p>The atmosphere at the Maksimir usually galvanises Croatia but that, of course, was an incentive to Capello. With this triumph his methods are beyond criticism, and his new team have already taken a long stride towards the 2010 World Cup.</p> <p>In addition, victory was England's settling of accounts with the sorrowful past. A 3-2 win for Croatia at Wembley 10 months ago barred them from Euro 2008. Failure breeds instability and of Capello's starting line-up here only Gareth Barry, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole had kicked off that night in November 2007.</p> <p>Last night's plan entailed the overriding of Capello's natural conservatism, with Walcott continuing in place of David Beckham. Any reservations about the youngster's ability to cover had been superseded by the conviction that his speed would unsettle Croatia, although the former captain did come on for a cameo and his 105th cap when the game had been won.</p> <p>England, inevitably in a trying environment, were not uniformly efficient. Ashley Cole, for instance, was unsteady at the start and set-pieces spread panic. After 13 minutes David James palmed a corner towards Vedran Corluka but his drive missed the target. With half an hour gone the goalkeeper flapped a free-kick to Mladen Petric only for the forward's effort to rebound from Wes Brown.</p> <p>Croatia's difficulties were far more severe. Simunic was inexcusably spared a second yellow card after body-checking Rooney, but the leniency of the referee Michel Lubos turned out to have its limits. There was no option but to send off Kovac for the elbow to the head of Cole</p> <p>Slaven Bilic's side were outplayed and out of control. The second goal for Walcott, drilled with vast confidence from an angle on the right, was set up by Rooney after neat interplay with Emile Heskey, who guided the United man back to a more exuberant and influential level.</p> <p>England, avoiding leniency against short-staffed opposition, struck again four minutes later. A Jenas cut-back was converted by Rooney. Croatia, so often imperious here, were left with nothing more to do than strive for damage limitation. It was an extraordinary achievement by England. Afterwards, Capello was in a mood to consign it to the archives, but this rout ought to be a memory which will invigorate the squad.</p>",
  "<p>Chelsea intend to contest a Football Association charge that they failed to keep their groundsman under control, leading to his infamous spat with Manchester United's Patrice Evra on April 26, when the Frenchman was warming down with his team-mates after they had lost a game 2-1.</p> <p>The governing body had initially laid charges against Sam Bethell but those were thrown out at a preliminary hearing into his conduct on Monday, when Chelsea said they had not told him he was subject to FA regulations and they had not mentioned it in his contract.</p> <p>Chelsea now consequently have until September 25 to respond to their charges, but they issued a statement on their website yesterday. \"We are surprised and extremely disappointed that the decision to charge the club has been taken nearly five months after the incident. The charges will be contested as we understand that no racist language was used and that Sam Bethell was doing no more than trying to defend himself. Chelsea FC is deeply committed to stamping out racist behaviour and would never condone it.\"</p> <p>The confrontation between Bethell and Evra took place well after the final whistle and led to unedifying scenes in which the Frenchman, Paul Scholes, Park Ji-sung and Carlos Tevez clashed with stewards and members of Bethell's staff. The groundsmen had asked the United players to move off an area they were trying to mow, but the players alleged that Bethell had aimed a racist insult at Evra, something Bethell denies.</p> <p>The ruling body's statement read: \"The FA has charged Chelsea FC for breaches of FA rules in relation to the conduct of their groundsman Sam Bethell and the nature of their employment contract with him. Firstly, the club has been charged with a breach of FA rule E20(a) for failing to ensure that Bethell conducted himself in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from any one or a combination of racist and/or abusive and/or provocative conduct and/or language ... Chelsea have consequently been charged for their failure to include the required provisions in his employment contract.\"</p> <p>Evra was charged with improper conduct and requested a personal hearing which has been scheduled for October 2.</p>",
  "<p>Back in Baghdad for the first time this year, I was consumed by the issue of change. What's different, I would ask almost every Iraqi I met. \"What about you, what do you see that's new?\", they would query in their turn. So here, in a few paragraphs, is a summary of my answers. Some things have changed for the better, others for the worse. Let's start with the positive.</p> <p>Security is massively <a href=\"http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/detail/10263.html\">improved</a>. Fears of random abduction and murder are reduced. The frequency of car bombs is down. Whereas Iraqis rarely left their homes, except for work and some hurried shopping, people dare to go out in the evening. Some 50,000 attended the finals of the national football championship in Baghdad the other night, a crowd which would have been anxious of being the target of a suicide attack this time last year. </p> <p>Was it the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_troop_surge_of_2007\">surge</a>\" of 30,000 extra troops which did it? That played a role, but the more important and larger \"surge\" was the Iraqi one. Iraqi police and army units are everywhere in Baghdad, while US troops are rarely to be seen. Uniformed Iraqis stand guard or sit in vehicles at virtually every cross-roads and roundabout in Baghdad. They man checkpoints every few hundred yards, observing traffic, occasionally pulling a driver over, and keeping an eye on each other. A year ago, the police were suspects themselves, often involved in sectarian brutality. Now, the police have been cleaned up, not yet fully, but enough to make a difference, especially with the army standing close by to watch them.</p> <p>The emergence among the Sunnis of al-Sahwa, the so-called Awakening movement, has also helped to enhance security. This is the second positive change. Several areas of Baghdad are patrolled by these new militias who used to fight the Americans and then switched to fighting al-Qaida. Now they run their areas on their own, telling the Iraqi police as well as the Americans that they are not wanted. The Americans call them \"sons of Iraq\" or \"concerned local citizens\" and pay them, but whatever their name, they perform a vital security function.</p> <p>A major result \u2013 my third good change \u2013 is that hundreds of displaced Sunni and Shia families are coming home. It is well-known that the longer refugees stay away, the harder it is for them ever to go back. Their property is looted or taken over. They put down roots elsewhere. A year ago it seemed that the capital city's mixed neighbourhoods were doomed. Over half a million Baghdadis had fled to different parts of the city where they felt safer. Baghdad seemed fated to become a mosaic of ethnically cleansed monocultural enclaves.</p> <p>That is no longer true. Some of the displacement is turning out to be reversible, and the Iraqi government is making a serious effort to speed it up. It says <a href=\"http://electroniciraq.net/news/newsanalysis/Iraqi_government_cracks_down_on_squatters-3345.shtml\">squatting</a> in someone else's home will be punishable by three years in jail and, starting this month, will use the Iraqi army to force squatters out.</p> <p>The fourth change is a gradual shift away from the Islamist politics of the last few years to something more inclusive, tolerant, and democratic. It is a hard thing to put your finger on, but there's a more secular mood in the air. For two years Baghdad was in the grip of an intra-Arab Sunni-versus-Shia civil war. That phase is over. People looked into the abyss, and pulled themselves back.</p> <p>I heard the most optimistic take on this new sense of moderation from Raid Jahid Fahmi, the minister of science and technology, an LSE-trained leader of the Iraqi Communist party. \"We are living in brutal, violent times, but Iraqi society is finding a new equilibrium,\" he told me. With his Iraqi government colleagues in mind, he added:</p> <blockquote> <p>Look at many of these Islamic leaders. Look at their discourse, their practice, and the projects they adopt. It's different from what they believed in the past. The mentality of sectarianism is on the decline. I don't know the degree of their sincerity, but they now accept having a law-based state and a multicultural civil society. It's hard to find a family in Baghdad which didn't lose at least one member, but the forces which were responsible for this have suffered a great deal of discredit. People have learnt from their experiences.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alas, not all the changes in Baghdad are for the better. On the negative side I would put the extraordinary increase in hatred and suspicion of Iran among Baghdad's Sunni Arabs. Sunnis have never liked the mullahs in Tehran. But now, thanks to the mass killings of Sunnis by Shias in the last two years as well as the constant drum-beat of anti-Iranian propaganda from the Americans, it is hard to find a Sunni leader who does not see Iran as the main source of Iraq's troubles. In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhamiyah\">Adhamiya</a>, a largely Sunni suburb, the Awakening council leader Abu Abed Ali Bahjat insisted that al-Qaida in Iraq was run by Iran. Osama bin Laden's son lived in Iran, he assured me, where he was in charge of forging links with Lebanon's Hizbullah.</p> <p>Iraq's vice-president Tariq al-Hashemi, the country's leading Sunni politician, was less paranoid but equally blunt. \"Unfortunately, Iran is a troublemaker rather than being a responsible and honest neighbour. There is a major threat from Iran,\" he told me.</p> <p>Bad, too, is the government's new move to disarm al-Sahwa. A year ago, the country's Shia leaders were cautiously welcoming the Awakening movement as a vital weapon against al-Qaida. Now, they see its newfound strength as a danger, and are trying to force it to disband, even though it has improved Baghdad's security. </p> <p>The third negative change is the new risk of armed clashes between Arabs and Kurds. Low-level tension between the two communities over the oil-rich <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93572449\">Kirkuk</a> region and other parts of northern Iraq has been a feature of the Iraqi scene for years. But it has become sharper in the last few months, and there is a real danger that major violence could erupt. It would only take one spark to ignite the Kirkuk oil drum and then we could see Arab-versus-Kurdish killing in every area where both people are neighbours today. The danger should not be exaggerated, but it is certainly more real than a year ago.</p> <p>Finally, one has to mention the enormous legacy of human misery which the invasion and five years of occupation unleashed. Is it worse than a year ago? Has anything changed here? Probably not, but as the prospect of a US troop reduction gains strength whoever wins the White House in November, the full toll of disaster comes more clearly into focus.</p> <p>The impact of the recent short-term improvements makes it easier to comprehend the medium- and long-term tasks ahead. A country with more than a million widows, where barely half the children go to school (because of displacement, continuing security fears, and teacher shortages), with drastic scarcities of electric power and water, and an eighth of its people living abroad, many of them those with the best education and the most needed skills, is not going to get back on its feet any time soon.</p> <p><strong>To view Sean Smith's devastating film reportage about the occupation of Iraq, including the frank testimony of the US soldiers with whom he was embedded and who were engaged in heavy fighting in Sadr City and Shulla, go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/11/endgame.iraq\">here</a>.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Every word Europeans (and many Americans) hear about Sarah Palin chills their blood - none more so than <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4720440.ece\">her religious beliefs</a>, or at least those of her pastors at the Wasilla Assembly of God church, or the Juneau Christian Centre. But even as it does so, the social conservatives of the American religious right flock ever more enthusiastically to her support.</p> <p>She's saying all the right things for them, and what does it matter what effete, Islamo-friendly, panty-waisted, God-denying, anti-Christian, sopping wet liberal European surrender monkeys think? They don't have a vote, so there. And they probably have bad teeth.</p> <p>Palin's emergence has enthused the religious right, many of whom had thought they might have to sit out this year's presidential election because of the lack of a suitable candidate to vote for. They didn't - and don't - trust John McCain, good Episcopalian Anglican that he is, almost equivalent to calling him a Marxist in some religious eyes, because he hasn't enthusiastically signed up to any of their agenda, particularly abortion.</p> <p>But they like what they hear about Palin, even though she has said very little about her beliefs, or anything else, in recent days. For them the fact that she might be only a heartbeat away from the presidency is a reassurance not a worry. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dobson\">James Dobson</a>, head of Focus on the Family, the influential and deeply conservative radio and televangelist (though he is a child psychologist by training, not an ordained minister) who preaches daily to 20m Americans through 4,000 radio stations and 500 local newspapers and sees himself as an influential kingmaker in Republican circles, having said earlier in the spring that he could never vote for McCain, now says - phew! - that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0808/Dobson_greenlights_McCainPalin.html\">Palin has won him over</a>.</p> <p>At this stage, it's not so much the policies - this isn't a campaign about issues, as one of McCain's aides said the other day - it is the words voters are listening for. George Bush (like McCain brought up an Episcopalian and now, only marginally less troublingly, a Methodist) earned their votes by saying all the right things, hitting all the buzzwords and phrases - the so-called \"God Talk\" - and they hope that she will do the same if given the chance.</p> <p>During one televised debate in 2000, Bush was famously asked who was his <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week410/cover.html\">favourite philosopher</a> and answered, without missing a beat, \"Christ. Because he changed my heart,\" an answer credited with winning over a large slice of the religious vote. Remember: that vote is estimated to make up about 23% of the US electorate, but its importance is that it can be mobilised and turns out on election day, unlike half the electorate, so its weighting is disproportionate even to its size. Bush won 78% of religious voters in 2004. Add to that that it is heavily represented in the south, midwest and west, states which already have a disproportionate weighting in the electoral system, and its importance cannot be overestimated.<br> And Palin seems to have the words. They're not so worried about what she thinks about how to solve the subprime mortgage crisis, but that she routinely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin3\">invokes God at every opportunity</a>, whether advocating the exploitation of the Alaskan oil reserves or prosecuting the war on terror. That she may also be a believer in Creationism - or at least its ostensibly slightly more secular incarnation, Intelligent Design - is a bonus. That she may have asked about banning books in libraries is also a good sign.<br> As is the fact that she has encouraged her teenaged unmarried daughter to have her baby: abortion of the child, or her Down syndrome son, would have been unthinkable and would have had the side-effect of making her an impossible candidate for the vice-presidency, or even probably the mayoralty of Wasilla. The fact that leaders of the religious right and their shock-jock cheerleaders would have excoriated Michelle Obama if one of the Obama daughters had been old enough to have conceived a child out of wedlock is neither here nor there. They, of course, did not scruple to describe Mrs Obama as a baby-momma, slang for a juvenile, black, unmarried mother.</p> <p>The fact that Palin's religious principles and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/uselections2008.sexeducation\">abstinence training</a> evidently had little effect on her 17-year-old's sexual practices can be ignored, and her insistence that the children should be carried to term spun as a cause for celebration, not concern. Many of us might agree with those decisions, even as we find the one-eyed hypocrisy with which the right casually smears the personal lives of its opponents while demanding respect for the privacy and integrity of its own candidates deeply dispiriting.</p> <p>From what we know of Palin's religious background, the fact that she was born a Catholic and is now a Pentecostalist may be unusual in British or European terms, but is not at all so in the US, where many religious folk change their denominational allegiances during the course of their lives as their beliefs or circumstances change. Pentecostalism, with the attendant beliefs of many of its sects and adherents in the Rapture and the End Days or indeed the full blood-curdling theory of Premillenial Dispensationalism, is a fairly rarefied flower even among evangelicals in Britain (except for in the majority black churches), but is widely held in American Protestant sects.</p> <p>The theory, based on over-literalist extrapolations of interpretations from verses in the Book of Revelation, was formulated largely by Englishmen, notably the 19th-century evangelist John Nelson Darby, and has spawned a whole political belief system especially impinging on some American attitudes to the Middle East, scene of the putative final battle of Armageddon.<br> The key will be whether, in the unlikely event of Palin having any say in foreign policy in a McCain administration, she would wish to base her attitude and the administration's policy toward Israel and Palestine on such a weird set of ideas. If she did, there are plenty of Pentecostalists in the US and across the third world - Pentecostalism being arguably the fastest-growing religious movement in the world and now the second-largest Christian denomination with 500m followers - who would find her beliefs perfectly unexceptionable.</p> <p>In that sense, the raucous religious right in the US is correct to jeer that it is Europe that is out of step in deriding fundamentalism, rather than the likes of Sarah Palin. The idea of American policy based on the sort of ideas in Tim LaHaye's Left Behind series of novels - 60m copies sold to hockey moms and their husbands in the last few years - is just too bizarre to contemplate. Isn't it?</p>",
  "<p>John McCain, as a solo act, was never going to be a star in his own right. But for a few minutes today amid thousands of cheering supporters he could feel like one - if he only ignored the chanting: Sarah, Sarah.</p> <p>That's the sting of reflected glory. For McCain that is the price for choosing a running mate in Sarah Palin, the hockey mum turned Alaska governor who has replicated among Republicans the kind of excitement Democratic activists had for Barack Obama.</p> <p>But it also makes McCain seem strangely like a supporting player at his own presidential campaign. Today's crowds dutifully wore their McCain buttons and praised the candidate's war record in Vietnam and long years in the Senate, but if not for Palin's appearance on the Republican ticket, would they have made it to the rally today?</p> <p>Probably not, some said. A number said they may not have even bothered to go out to vote for McCain next November if he had not chosen Palin was his running mate.</p> <p>\"She definitely for me makes it a slam dunk,\" said Brian Sullivan, a photographer. \"He was already my pick anyway, but this makes it a slam dunk.\"</p> <p>Organisers said today's rally in Fairfax, a suburb of Washington, DC, was the biggest since McCain and Palin took to the road together, energising hardcore supporters, and boosting the Republican's popularity among white women.</p> <p>The turnout was almost overwhelmingly white, but it was also younger than most Republican events, with young families, and parents bringing school-age children.</p> <p>Some estimates put the crowd at above 15,000, or about twice the population of Palin's hometown in Wasilla, Alaska.</p> <p>It is also the last - at least for a couple of days. Palin was headed home to Alaska today.<br>In her 10 days on the national stage, Palin has deviated little from her wildly popular - among Republicans anyway - convention speech, delivering an abbreviated and tamer version in rallies in Missouri, Pennsylania and today Virginia.</p> <p>Barack Obama is hoping to turn the once reliably Republican state to the Democrats this year, and is counting heavily on independent voters in northern suburbs, such as Fairfax.</p> <p>On stage today, flanked by McCain and her husband, Todd, Palin wore her now-trademark severe dark suit and updo. Cindy McCain, in parrot green and pearls, stood a few steps behind the trio.</p> <p>On this occasion, Palin dispensed with her cosy preamble about being a hockey mum, and raising five children, and went straight into a recital of her cost-cutting measures as governor of Alaska and extolling McCain's stand on Iraq.</p> <p>\"I put the state's cheque book on line for all the world to see,\" she said. \"That state luxury jet - that was little over the top - so I put it on eBay.\"</p> <p>Then she told how she blocked a wasteful bridge project. \"I told Congress, 'thanks but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere'.\"<br>Since Palin burst on the national scene, the Republicans have been forced to admit that the plane did not actually sell on eBay. Campaign aides also admit that Palin was originally for the bridge, before opposing it.</p> <p>But those details didn't matter to the crowds, who saw Palin as the most exciting force in presidential politics for years. For committed Republicans, she was the binding factor convincing them to vote for a candidate who had somehow never been an entirely comfortable fit with his party base.</p> <p>\"I liked McCain, but I was a little wishy-washy,\" said Michelle Ferry, an army wife and realtor with a newborn daughter. \"I might not have even voted before Sarah.\"</p> <p>\"She's fantastic,\" said Cathy Sweetser, who works at a local bank. \"She brought to the campaign that change is not just an ivory tower. She has brought the youth, the female factor, the younger generation. She has brought most importantly to me, a lot of women who were sitting on the fence.\"</p> <p>Before Sarah Palin arrived on the ticket, even the most loyal Republicans had had doubts about McCain, serious doubts.<br>McCain - on his own - was too old to be president. He was not a true conservative. He was \"too Washington,\" a prisoner of his two decades in the Senate in an election when voters seem to want to turn the clock back to Year Zero. And he was a little dull.</p> <p>In the days since the convention, McCain, too, appears to be feeding off the excitement off the crowd. He is more animated on the stump in recent days, and the campaign more confrontational in trying to claim the mantle of change from Obama.</p> <p>\"Our opponent is an agent of change. He has changed his position on just about every issue,\" said Fred Thompson, the Law and Order actor and one-time presidential candidate, now taking second billing to the McCain-Palin double act.</p> <p>The Republicans are also aggressively courting supporters of Hillary Clinton who have yet to warm to Obama. Opinion polls suggest that the effort - plus Palin's selection - have helped McCain win over white women voters.</p> <p>The campaign pressed that home today, with a line-up of speakers that included two women who had once counted themselves as Democrats, but were now with McCain. \"I might not agree with Senator McCain and Governor Palin on all the issues, but I don't agree with any candidate all the time,\" said Lynette Long, a former Clinton supporter, who said women had been treated shabbily by the Democrats.</p> <p>The appeal to Clinton supporters is unlikely to go over well with committed Republicans. A number of women in the crowd were hostile to Clinton. But others say they see the same steely intelligence in Palin as they did in Clinton.</p> <p>\"I voted for Hillary,\" said Maria Juliano, a fashion consultant. \"I see the same intelligence and guts I saw in her in Palin.\"</p> <p>She added: \"She can hold her own against any man and all the politicians - just like Hillary.\"</p>",
  "<p>An elderly white member of the Ku Klux Klan who was responsible for one of the most brutal killings of the civil rights period when he tied engine blocks to the feet of two black teenagers and threw them alive into the Mississippi river has had his conviction overturned by a US appeals court.</p> <p>The decision to throw out the three life sentences imposed last year on James Ford Seale, aged 72, throws into doubt attempts by the FBI to bring to justice the perpetrators of scores of lynchings and murders that swept the South of the US during the 1950s and 60s. </p> <p>Three judges sitting on the fifth US circuit court of appeals ruled that the case against Seale, was went to trial last May, 43 years after the original murders, had fallen outside its sell-by date. </p> <p>The ruling conceded that the statute of limitations that imposes a time limit on legal action \"in some cases deprives society of its ability to prosecute criminal offences\" but argued \"that is the price we pay for repose\".</p> <p>The murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, both aged 19, were among the most notorious acts of white southern supremacists who sought to silence opposition to segregation through violence and intimidation.</p> <p>The year of the slayings, 1964, was known as Freedom Summer in the South because of efforts by civil rights campaigners to overcome barriers to black people registering to vote.</p> <p>On May 2 1964 Seale and other members of the Mississippi branch of the White Knights of the KKK kidnapped the teenagers, who they suspected of being involved in civil rights activity, as they were hitchhiking to a party. </p> <p>The men were tied to a tree and beaten 30 or 40 times with a stick, before being thrown into the river with a Jeep engine block tied to their legs. </p> <p>An FBI informant inside the Klan alleged that Seale told him later that he decided to throw them alive into the water as to shoot them first would have splattered blood over the boat.</p> <p>The victims' partially decomposed bodies were found months later only as a result of an on-going search into a separate slaying in which three civil rights activists were killed in events captured in the film Mississippi Burning.</p> <p>Seale was arrested in 1964 but no action was taken against him - according to federal prosecutors because the local police were in cahoots with the KKK. </p> <p>For many years he was presumed dead, but he was tracked down by Thomas Moore, brother of one of the dead teenagers, together with a Canadian documentary crew and the case was reopened.</p> <p>Seale was rearrested in January 2007.</p> <p>Seale's conviction came largely on the testimony of another Klan member Charles Edwards who was controversially granted immunity from prosecution in return for appearing in the witness stand.</p> <p>Moore told the Mississippi paper the Clarion Ledger that he was surprised by the acquittal of his brother's murderer. \"It's a shock, but there's nothing I can do. The truth was told, and the law is the law.\"</p> <p>The civil rights division of the federal justice department in Washington is now reviewing the appeal court ruling with an eye to its implications not only in this case but in up to 100 other unsolved murders from the civil rights period that are being looked at again by the FBI. </p> <p>A special unit of the bureau was set up last year to pursue the most promising cases in the hope of bringing closure to some of them before the individuals involved become too infirm to prosecute or died.</p> <p>Seale, who pleaded not guilty at his trial, has been held at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he has been receiving medical treatment for cancer and other conditions. It is possible that he will remain in jail pending a further appeal against his release by the<br>prosecutors.</p> <p>Contacted by the Clarion Ledger, his wife Jenny said: \"Oh man, yes, he's coming home. I've prayed and I've prayed. Now you can get the man who's really guilty.\"</p> <p>She did not specify which guilty party she had in mind.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 13 2008. In the report above we said that, according to federal prosecutors, no action was taken at the time because local police were in cohorts with the KKK. We meant cahoots. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>The South African government's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7583487.stm\">recent decision</a> to abandon its Expropriation Bill, aimed at addressing the painfully slow pace of land reform, prompts the question: how can the country move towards a more equitable distribution of land and natural resources 14 years after the end of apartheid? Given the catastrophe in Zimbabwe following Mugabe's land seizure policy, South Africa needs to get it right.</p> <p>Land reform has always been high on the ANC's agenda. In negotiations over the 1996 constitution it secured the inclusion of provisions to enable it to force through the land reforms necessary to give the black majority a real stake in the country's economy. The constitution includes both a commitment to \"the right to land ownership\" and an acknowledgment that under exceptional circumstances that right could be suspended to promote land reform. Until recently, however, the government opted not to exercise its constitutional right to expropriate land.</p> <p>There are three elements to the current land reform programme: redistribution, primarily focused on providing agricultural land to the landless rural poor; restitution to return to its rightful owners land that was expropriated under the 1913 Native Land Act; and tenure reform \u2013 legislation to improve the security of tenure of all citizens.</p> <p>These three measures were supposed to place 30% of agricultural land under black ownership by 2014. So far just 4% has been transferred. The redistribution programme has been compromised by the decision to base it on the principle of \"willing buyer, willing seller\" which means that white land owners have to want to sell their land, and black purchasers must be able to raise funds to pay the market price. State efforts to acquire land for redistribution have been hampered by landowners' reluctance to sell, and rising land prices.</p> <p>As the South African Human Rights Commission <a href=\"http://www.sahrc.org.za/sahrc_cms/downloads/Pace%20Land%20Reform.doc\">argued</a> in 2004, \"land reform is not an end in itself; it must go beyond mere compensation or settlement and focus on economic empowerment of rural communities. But as a <a href=\"http://www.fwdklerk.org.za/page.php?recordID=70\">2007 report</a> by the FW De Klerk Foundation makes clear, it's not just a rural problem. South Africa is already 60% urbanised and this will rise to 70% by 2014. Even if the land issue was addressed, few such of those who moved to towns to find work would return home.</p> <p>Agriculture contributed 9.1% of the country's GDP in 1965, today it contributes just 2.6%. White farmers are getting out because it's hard to make a decent living. Small-scale farming may reduce poverty among the previously landless rural population, but commercial agriculture is not going to provide jobs for the urban unemployed. </p> <p>Land redistribution will remain negligible if left to the market under the \"willing buyer, willing seller\" principle. But even if more land were transferred, there's no guarantee that effective economic participation by the black majority would increase. Whether achieved through the market mechanism, or via government instigated expropriations, as a <a href=\"http://www.plaas.org.za/\">recent report</a> from the University of the Western Cape points out, if the objective is simply the de-racialisation of commercial agriculture, land reform will not address poverty and exclusion.</p> <p>South Africa's transition has been guided by principles of justice and reconciliation (even if justice has yet to permeate the economic sphere). Any attempt to seize land from white farmers would undo years of progress. The criteria for deciding how best to promote land reform must take into account the interests of all citizens. And if the biggest obstacle is the way the economy is structured, then radical economic changes should be considered. But then the government knows all about this:</p> <p>In 1994 it established a tax commission to investigate whether the land problem could be addressed through changes in the tax regime. As <a href=\"http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/feder-kris_south-africa-economic-reform.html\">documented</a> by Fred Harrison and Kris Feder, a persuasive case was made for the gradual introduction of <a href=\"http://ipfconsultants.net/Land_Value_Taxation.html\">land value taxation</a> (LVT) in order to facilitate land reform without resort to expropriation. This was rejected only after the intervention of the Free Market Foundation of South Africa - essentially a lobby group for the diamond mining industry - whose report followed a long tradition of vested interests. </p> <p>The ANC government, keen not to alienate anyone in its early years, opted to stick to the tried and tested economic formula, which, even in countries spared the injustice of apartheid, routinely leads to the concentration of land ownership by a small minority.</p> <p>Some continued to make the case for LVT: \"It's high time we introduced a land tax,\" said Glen Thomas, Director General of the Department for Land Affairs (DLA) in 2004. \"This would help us finance land reform and ensure prices for buying land are affordable.\" Unfortunately he lost his job last October. The De Klerk Foundation came down firmly against LVT in a concluding paragraph that included none of the rigorous research that characterised the rest of its report.</p> <p>As Godfrey Dunkley explained in his 2004 <a href=\"http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/dunkley-godfrey_land-ownership-in-south-africa.html\">submission</a> to the DLA, taxing land values would address economic exclusion among both the landless rural poor and the urban unemployed. It would enable the redistribution of land via the market mechanism under the principle of \"willing buyer, willing seller\" without the need for government intervention, and it would facilitate a gradual redistribution of land ownership and access to economic opportunities.</p> <p>FW De Klerk recently <a href=\"http://www.fwdklerk.org.za/speeches.php\">expressed concern</a> that white South Africans could, \"on the basis of race, be deprived of property in which they might have invested their life's labour and resources\". Expropriation would so deprive them, but the gradual introduction of a tax on land values would leave the benefits of their effort untaxed (unlike at present) while taxing only their (unearned) income from land, generating revenues for investment in infrastructure and public services.</p> <p>South Africa remains an ideal testing ground for LVT, but so far vested interests, the World Bank and political timidity have prevented it. Meanwhile, the land reform programme is a shambles.</p> <p>The government has three choices: to carry on as things are: intolerably slow land reform with little impact on poverty; to bring back the Expropriations Bill (as it has promised) and risk a repeat of the disaster in Zimbabwe; or to recognise the role of land rent in the economy, and the benefits of collecting it for the wider community.

Still doing the hornpipe over his success sinking John Kerry, since his book Unfit for Command, plus a few million in conservative foundation dollars helped torpedo the Democratic candidate below the water-line even before he noticed, Corsi has now launched <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Nation-Leftist-Politics-Personality/dp/1416598065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220977645&amp;sr=8-1\">Obama Nation</a> into the New York Times bestseller lists.<br> Generally only dubious scientists, quack doctors and freaky cosmologists dress themselves in a little brief acronymic authority by putting their titles after their name on the cover of books. Corsi repeats his (apparently genuine) PhD on every single verso page heading.</p> <p>Nor does the bestseller list mean best read, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">far-too-discreet little dagger</a> next to Obama Nation and several other current conservative hatchet jobs indicates. It means that there have been bulk purchases from bookshops. If a foundation wants to give away free books, it can get a bulk wholesale rate directly from the publishers. Paying retail for bulk buys is more expensive, but it's an effective way to puff them onto the bestseller list.<br> Even so, I do appreciate writers like <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fact-or-fiction-the-incredible-world-of-kitty-kelley-428539.html\">Kitty Kelly</a>, when they scrutinise the toe-jam on the clay feet of the great, good and royal, so I tried to appreciate Corsi's opus as an example of that genre. Obama is not perfect, after all, and it always helps to temper optimism with realism.<br> However, I almost gave up reading during the introduction, when Corsi referred to his extensive \"footnoting all references so readers can determine for themselves the truth and validity of the factual claims.\" Truth and validity, a tautology, elides into an oxymoron: fact and claims are different animals outside the faith-based universe. He refers to Obama's \"pattern of voting on the far left on a wide range of policy issues,\" which is only true if you consider Margaret Thatcher to be a charter member of the Weathermen. Even more risibly, Corsi suggests that Obama would \"lead the United States in a costly and self-destructive direction, both at home and abroad. \u2026 We would be a militarily weakened and economically diminished nation\". Presumably, a less faith-based Corsi might note that his hypothetical state of the nation under Obama is the actual state after two terms of George Bush. Corsi avers: \"Growing numbers of largely Hispanic illegal immigrants, many of them still citizens of their home countries \u2026 live in our midst with no firm purpose or requirement to become American citizens.\" I suspect that most of them are unaware that US passports are on offer. This is the voice of prejudice that in one breath condemns immigrants for both taking our jobs while living on welfare!</p> <p>Corsi expands his almost limitless ability to have his cake and eat it when he cites Wall Street Journal and Fox consultant John Fund, who complains that Obama beat Alan Keyes, an \"unserious\" GOP candidate, to get in the Senate. This is true, but Keyes and Corsi himself were recently trying to get the <a href=\"http://www.constitutionparty.com/\">Constitution party</a> <a href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55735\">nomination for the presidency</a>. Unseriousness is clearly contagious.</p> <p>On the other hand, Corsi is not always completely wrong. His analysis of Hillary Clinton's mistake in <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/05092008/news/nationalnews/hill_drops_a_racial_bomb_110095.htm\">using the race card</a> is quite accurate, even though his claim that her \"campaign attacks against Barack Obama legitimised many of the lines of inquiry explored in the first two sections of this book,\" is a stretch. Her campaign no more justifies his \"lines of inquiry\" than his book retrospectively koshers her cynical use of the race card.</p> <p>Occasionally Corsi asks legitimate questions, but he consistently refuses to accept legitimate answers, and it would appear that his sole purpose in examining some of the weirder myths of the blogosphere is to keep them afloat. For example, he says magnanimously: \"I accept Obama's statement that he is a Christian, but take exception to the claim that Obama was not introduced to Islam as a child.\" But who made that claim? Obama's team said that he had never been a Muslim, not that he not been \"introduced to Islam\" the same way that I was \"introduced to Anglicanism\" when dragooned to Church for the school Founder's Day service.<br> With spurious academic authority he declares: \"We have already established that Obama wrote the autobiography to hide key points.\" Oh no, we haven't. Obama's books probably do suffer from overhyping, but he was explicit that these are not autobiographical chronicles. So when Obama says he used marijuana, it does not earn him brownie points for being unevasively un-Clintonian, or indeed un-Bushian. Rather it is a cynical political prophylactic against the chance of him being revealed. Corsi joined in hounding Obama to disown the Rev Jeremiah Wright, then attacking his disloyalty to his old mentor when he did. McCarthy meets Kevin Bacon, as acquaintances of acquaintances are marshalled and alleged to be communist or Muslim, in that modern form of conservative colour-blindness where red and green are indistinguishable. People like Saul Alinsky (the guru of community organisers) died never meeting Obama. But some people he knew did, and so \u2026 . Perhaps most bizarre, if you are not attuned to the conservative evangelical fixation on Kenya, is Corsi's depiction of Obama's involvement there. For the rest of the world, an authoritarian tribalist government fixed an election but was forced to compromise with the democratic winner in the face of riots. To the evangelical right, despite <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10415208\">\"credible signs of electoral fraud\"</a> Kenyan President Kibaki is a hero, not to be overthrown by the mere casting of ballots.<br> In Corsi's narrative, Obama's Luo tribal paternity led him to intervene on behalf of a \"communist\" (incidentally Anglican) Odinga, who was furthermore a Muslim stooge pledged to introduce Sharia law in an overwhelmingly Christian country. Obama \"could claim to be a Kenyan citizen\" \u2013 the same way, presumably that McCain could claim to a Panamian citizenship or the Clintons and Kennedys Irish, or indeed any Jewish politician could claim Israeli citizenship. It is typical of Corsi's use of sources that he quotes Mainu Wararu, \"respected international correspondent\", on the fears that Kikuyu have about Obama in the White House. However he skips Waruru's conclusion: \"This attitude is running counter to views of majority of Kenyans who are excited by every victory by the US democrat frontrunner and are praying day and night for more victories for this <a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/16948\">'son of Kenya'</a>.\"<br> Incidentally, applying his own methodology that every accusation is true unless definitively disproven, I checked with Notre Dame professor <a href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~dmyers/\">Daniel Myers</a>, the custodian of the archives of the Lemberg Centre for the Study of Violence, which Corsi claims to have worked with. There is no record of his presence there. Of course, this does not prove that he wasn't \u2013 but he does not give his victim the same indulgence.<br> Corsi's smearing of fact, supposition and slander into a quantum slime really made me wish I had worn rubber gloves when reading. Nonetheless, Obama and his team should really read this book, even if it seems like turning over a stone to study the things that scurry from underneath. They do not need an enigma machine to plot the enemy fleet's manoeuvres. It's all here.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Ben Seymour (synths) and Melanie Gilligan (vocals).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Petit Mal may be an electro-pop duo comprising one boy and one girl, but The Ting Tings they are not. Their debut single isn't called \"Oi! DJ Shut Up and Let Me Dance\" or anything like that. No, it's called Crisis In the Credit System and, notwithstanding Stereolab's socio-political messages and Marxist critiques, it's the first pop song about the credit crunch, even though it was actually written two years ago. Which makes them not just brainier than The Ting Tings, but more prescient, too.</p> <p>They must be brainy because one of them, Ben Seymour, is the Deputy Editor of online publication, Mute, who recently wrote something about regeneration and gentrification in London, made a film on the subject and worked on a series of photo-essays on the restructuring of the capital's East End while creating a research database for \"antagonists of contemporary urbanism\". Meanwhile, his partner Melanie Gilligan, hardly a dunce herself, is a sometime filmmaker who penned an article, Slumsploitation - The Favela on Film and TV, on \"the cinema of slums\" (eg City Of God), that explored the difficult subject of \"whether representation is the answer to 'social exclusion' or one of the mechanisms of its reproduction\". Blimey. As synthpop duos go, Petit Mal make the Pet Shop Boys look a bit, well, thick. One of their songs is called Mt Dimension and features a line about \"Escher-like cross-characterisation\". Petit Mal have been labelled \"Chris &amp; Cosey meet Malaria, with lyrics by Robbe-Grillet\". And not for nothing. Robbe-Grillet was a French writer (he died in February) whose style was described as \"phenomenological\". Enough said.</p> <p>And yet, and yet ... You can dance to them. Just. \"Petit mal\" is used to mean seizure, the sort that occurs during epilepsy, but you don't have to jerk manically like Ian Curtis while their music is playing. They've got that arty/accessible duality down pat, the sort that early '80s synth-duos used to have, so that before you even realise it, you're humming and moving along to ideas that are quite high-falutin' and complex. While the electronic melodies are easy on the ear, the lyrics are likely to be about how \"grief is a curious state\" or somesuch. Crisis In the Credit System might be sung with Teutonic dispassion by Gilligan, and it might be about \"the mysteries of the global financial system ... based on a prophecy of financial apocalypse\", but it's accompanied by a lovely melancholy tune and a finger-clicking electronic beat. Yes, the single will be featured in a four-part fictional film of the same name that Gilligan has scripted and directed (to be released online on September 29), one that makes connections between Northern Rock and Das Kapital, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable, even if a working knowledge of capitalist imperatives and socio-economic structures is recommended.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The most interesting and forward looking artists on the avant-electronic underground pop scene!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Erudite disco can have mass appeal \u2013 remember, the Pet Shop Boys used to reference Che Guevara and Debussy on their hits... <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Seize the means of production. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Induce seizures \u2013 this music really is just standard, infectious electro-pop.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Crisis In The Credit System is released by Difficult Fun on October 13. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Pet Shop Boys, Tears For Fears, OMD, Yazoo. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/petitmalpetitmal\">MySpace.com/petitmalpetitmal</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Plastic Little.</p>",
  "<p>For anyone looking for a single succinct passage that epitomises everything that is wrong with <a href=\"http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/bio.php\">Jeffrey Goldberg's</a> worldview, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/opinion/09goldberg.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=jeffrey%20goldberg&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">this is it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The next president must do one thing, and one thing only, if he is to be judged a success: He must prevent al-Qaida, or a Qaida imitator, from gaining control of a nuclear device and detonating it in America. Everything else \u2014 Fannie Mae, healthcare reform, energy independence \u2014 is commentary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even if you grant him the right to make a hyperbolic argument, the statement is absurd. The next president must do many things \u2013 not \"one thing only\" \u2013 if he is to be judged a success. And only some of those things involve preventing a nuclear attack on America.</p> <p>What we have here is basically the rehash of the Bush-neocon argument following 9/11 that the war on terror was to become the raison d'etre of our national government. Everything else took a backseat. And we can see where such an attitude led us. To disaster after disaster, whether it be domestic (Katrina) or foreign (Iraq). To the extent that John McCain adopts this political agenda as his own, it will doom his own presidency (should he be elected).</p> <p>A presidential agenda is the epitome of multi-tasking and juggling conflicting priorities. To the extent that any presidency becomes bogged down in, or obsessed by a single priority and takes its eye off the others \u2013 it must fail. The American people will simply not accept a monomaniacal president. In George Bush, we have come as close to that as we care to, and his cu<a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/us/jobapproval-bush.php\">rrent approval ratings</a> indicate what our judgment has been.</p> <p>Goldberg is unintentionally ironic in making this claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>The nuclear destruction of Lower Manhattan, or downtown Washington, would cause \u2026 the comprehensive repudiation of America's culture of civil liberties.</p> </blockquote> <p>What does he think has been happening since 9/11? A civil liberties picnic? He also fails to understand this it is precisely rants like his own that cause Americans to be prepared to repudiate civil liberties.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Times editors seem to have done a poor job of vetting statements such as this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Many proliferation experts I have spoken to judge the chance of such a detonation to be as high as 50% in the next 10 years.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which proliferation experts? And on what basis do they judge the possibility so likely? Might it be that some of these unnamed, unquoted alleged experts might have political axes of their own to grind? We actually can't be the judge of that since Goldberg conveniently omits any concrete reference to them.</p> <p>Here is another untested claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only technical complications prevent al-Qaida from executing a nuclear attack today.</p> </blockquote> <p>I simply must quote <a href=\"http://tonykaron.com/2008/09/09/all-the-hysteria-thats-fit-to-print-take-ii/\">Tony Karon's hilarious send-up</a> of this passage from his own blog:</p> <blockquote> <p>Is the New York Times edited by complete cretins?</p> <p>Only technical complications prevent my neighbour who smokes those horrible cigars from trading in his pit bull for a nuclear weapon. Only technical complications prevent me from turning my bicycle into a Maserati. And, technical complications aside, if my grandmother had had wheels, she'd have been a bus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Aside from technical complications, doesn't the tiny question of will come into play here as well? Meaning: does al-Qaida want to mount such a nuclear attack? Clearly, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/12/24/investigation.plane/\">Richard Reid</a> wanted to develop a dirty bomb. But what current intelligence indicates that al-Qaida is planning such an attack? I have seen none. Nor does Goldberg provide any. Since I am not an intelligence expert on this issue, it's possible that al-Qaida does want to mount such an attack. But you'll have to pardon me for preferring to see evidence on the subject before judging whether the claim is credible or not.</p> <p>Finally, in his <a href=\"http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/mccain_on_israel_iran_and_the_1.php\">interview with John McCain</a>, Goldberg elicits a startlingly erroneous claim about Hamas' goals and he does nothing to point this out:</p> <blockquote> <p>I asked [McCain] not long ago whether he believes that America conflates its problem with Iran with Israel's Iran problem. \u2026 \"I think these terrorist organisations that [Iran] sponsors, Hamas and the others, are also bent, at least long-term, on the destruction of the United States of America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If Goldberg were a truly capable interviewer and reporter alarm bells should've been ringing both during the interview and in writing this column. Yet he appears not to have recognised the grievous error McCain has made. Hamas has never expressed interest either in the short or long term in \"the destruction of the US\". Not even Hezbollah has done so. But since he mentions Hamas and not Hezbollah, let's stick with Hamas. You can argue that Hamas is many bad things, but you simply cannot credibly argue as McCain claims. Goldberg should've called him on it and didn't. Another opportunity lost.</p> <p>Finally, there can be no doubt that national security is a critical component of a successful president's agenda. I am not minimising the threat posed by al-Qaida or any terrorist threat. But I am warning against the hysteria and paranoia characteristic of Goldberg's perspective on this issue. Just because a journalist pundit and the Republican crew are prepared to go overboard doesn't mean we all have to jump ship with them.</p>",
  "<p>As we know, Charlie Gibson is interviewing Sarah Palin later this week. Folks are wondering what he'll ask her.</p> <p>Gibson of course was a participant in that glorious Obama-Clinton debate from Pennsylvania back during the primaries. For the record <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/Story?id=4670271&amp;page=1\">here are the questions he asked Obama</a> that night:</p> <p>1. Would you take Hillary as your veep.<br>2. You called working-class people bitter.<br>3. Explain why it took you so long to distance yourself from Jeremiah Wright.<br>4. Demonstrate that you're a patriot (tied in with the woman on video asking Obama about lapel pins).<br>5. Assure us that your timetable pledge about Iraq withdrawal is \"rock hard\"<br>6. Make an absolute pledge not to raise taxes on people making under $200,000 a year<br>7. Defend your idea of raising the capital gains tax (follow-up included Gibson's false assertion that \"history shows that when you drop the capital gainst tax, the revenues go up\").<br>8. Is the DC gun ban compatible with the Second Amendment/don't you secretly want to take away people's guns.</p> <p>Let's break it down. The first was the au courant insipid media question of the week, so we can sort of toss that one. The next three reinforced negative character narratives. The next two were sort of substantive but were silly \"will you say here and now for all time\" formulations that no sane human being should have to commit to. The last two were ostensibly about policy but were really gotcha questions with Gibson in search of getting a headline \"liberal stumbles on gotcha question.\"</p> <p>Just keep this handy for the Palin tete-a-tete.</p>",
  "<p>Lost in Showbiz has a new celebrity crush (assuming we're happy to stretch the definition of celebrity to breaking point) - Liam McMullan. This young tyke-about-town was bought to our attention by his appearance yesterday on the catwalk at the Betsey Johnson show at New York fashion week. It was an appearance characterised by a very, very bad impression of Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean.</p> <p>Anyway, should you be looking for a way to while away the minutes before hometime, I invite you to read the <a href=\"http://www.observer.com/2008/liam-mcmullan-purple-prince-city\">following interview</a> featuring some choice anecdotes from the interviewer about McMullan and his music producer, Mr Young:</p> <blockquote> <p>While the two men worked on the new song, Mr Young's blond, busty, beachy girlfriend was sitting on the couch wearing a tank top and skirt, next to a red-haired girl wearing a sailor's cap and dark shirt and pants. Neither spoke. Mr Young later told me his girlfriend gives him a sponge bath every morning.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>He had his first kiss at 15, he told me between sips of a Jack and Coke at a bar down the block from the dungeon. He lost his virginity at 18 to his high-school sweetheart of two years, Amy; a blue terry-cloth wristband now covers a tattoo of her name.</p> <p>\"It took one second, and it was just done,\" he said. \"I was just like 'Ahahahahah!' Now it just goes on forever. And I have these migraines now that do really hurt like balls when I'm having sex. I start being a dick then. I'm like, 'Um you can move around a little bit - I don't have to do all the work.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Pulitzer prize winning stuff, no? And make sure you check out the comments too.</p>",

  "<p>Last week, as you'll have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/05/raceineducation.raceinschools\">read</a>, Doctor <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wie/staff/teaching-research/steve_strand/\">Steve Strand</a> unveiled research which found a pattern of discrimination against Caribbean British 14-year-olds which reveals a particular reason why their results in <a href=\"http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/secondary/keystage3/\">Key Stage 3</a> Sats tests are poor. Interrogating government data, he saw that a large proportion \u2013 one in three \u2013 of children in this category are not entered for the most demanding versions of the science and maths tests despite their attainment in the previous three years being as good as white children who were. As the Guardian's education editor Polly Curtis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/sep/05/raceinschools.sats\">explained</a>, this has meant that, \"Significant numbers of black pupils who are academically capable of getting the higher marks have them taken out of their reach\". Relatively reduced levels of outcome have therefore been guaranteed.</p> <p>Educationalists and campaigners have responded here at Cif and elsewhere. Despite the government pointing to a narrowing of the attainment gap at the subsequent GCSE level over the past four years, all have called for further action. There are, though, differences about where and how this action be should be directed. Gus John <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/05/raceineducation.raceinschools?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=uknews\">argued</a> that Strand's work confirms what black parents have known for years and advocates a joint approach with teachers to correct the failing. Lee Jasper has been <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hrdXGwFBknsEi1ioOEX15emqQibQ\">quoted</a> as saying that the answer is schools run by black governors and staffed by black teachers which, though they would be open to anyone \u2013 a point enthusiastically <a href=\"http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2008/09/lee-jasper-calls-for-segregated-schools.html\">ignored</a> by political partisans \u2013 would have the specific needs of black youngsters in mind. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/05/raceinschools.raceineducation\">Tony Sewell</a> contends that it is wrong to blame teachers because the biggest problem is an anti-learning culture among black boys (most of his piece does not identify Caribbean boys in particular, nor does it make much mention of girls) which schools cannot be held responsible for.</p> <p>As always I've found this familiar debate in some respects falsely polarised: is there any essential conflict between encouraging Caribbean Britons to self-mobilise in terms of what their children aspire to, and encouraging teachers to do the same with regard to the tendency Strand has unearthed? It's also been rather demoralising. I dislike the idea of a particular group of Britons being educated separately \u2013 as both Sewell and Jasper, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/19/race.raceineducation\">old antagonists</a>, advocate in their different ways \u2013 yet I could hardly blame Caribbean British parents for concluding that, whatever they do themselves, the state schooling system will never serve their children as it should.</p> <p>Strand's findings also appear to validate a broader pessimism. In trying to explain why teachers weren't entering Caribbean youngsters for the more demanding versions of Sats despite their attainment records suggesting they were up to it, he has talked about the relationships between some Caribbean pupils and some white teachers, the former often believing the latter do not give them a fair chance and switching off, the latter finding the former confrontational resulting in lowered perceptions of their academic potential. Might variations on this type of tension also be contributing to depressed educational achievements among other categories of pupil? </p> <p>We would be very naive indeed to suggest that \"race\" \u2013 I place the word in quotes for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/09/race.science\">a reason</a> \u2013 isn't a factor in school environments that works against black children: other <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Young-Masculinities-Understanding-Contemporary-Society/dp/0333779231\">researchers</a> have demonstrated the persistence with which non-black children perceive black boys especially in stereotypical terms and the difficulties black boys have resisting this. Yet Strand's findings seemed to fit into the larger pattern of avoidable underachievement in which children from poorer homes \u2013 where Caribbeans would be strongly represented \u2013 start to fall behind in relation to those from more affluent backgrounds as their school careers proceed, despite in some cases starting out ahead of them. Children from certain cultures and social classes persistently drop back educationally and their schools are failing to prevent it.</p> <p>The reasons for this are, of course, complex and various, with the influence of gender forming a part too. But having spoken to Steve Strand and had a look at his research it is plain that social class lies behind the biggest \"attainment gap\" and is therefore the biggest predictor (to use the jargon) of academic outcomes. Strands' research has illuminated a particular \u2013 and very telling \u2013 thread of the big, intricate story of how disadvantage is reproduced. It goes without saying that schools alone can't be expected to correct this just as it would obviously help if every sort of poor and non-professional family encouraged their children to learn. </p> <p>Even so, with the middle-classes pulling the educational ladder up behind them so effectively, it may be that if our schools are to serve all our children equally, whatever their sex, background or ethnicity, they may need to organise themselves more imaginatively, flexibly and \u2013 in the best and broadest sense of the term \u2013 multiculturally.</p>",
  "<p>A Monroe Circuit Court judge has ruled Florida's 31-year-old gay adoption ban unconstitutional in an order that allows an openly gay Key West foster parent to adopt a teenage boy he has raised since 2001.</p> <p>Declaring the adoption to be in the boy's \"best interest\", circuit judge David J Audlin Jr, said the Florida law forbidding gays and lesbians from adopting children is contrary to the state constitution because it singles out a group for punishment.</p> <p>Florida is one of only two states - including Mississippi - that forbid gay people from adopting children.</p> <p>Though the statute has been found unconstitutional by circuit judges in Florida twice before, both in 1991, another adoption case expected to be heard next month in a Miami courtroom may also provide a new challenge to the law.</p> <p>At the heart of the Monroe county case is a 13-year-old boy with learning disabilities and special needs placed by the state's Department of Children &amp; Families placed in the two-story home of a Key West foster father in 2001. The boy, identified as John Doe, has remained with the foster father ever since. The father, who is 52, also is not identified.</p> <p>Audlin appointed the foster father as guardian for the boy in 2006, but at a recent hearing, the boy testified that he wanted the foster dad to be his \"forever father\" - like all the other kids had.<br>When asked why he wanted his guardian to adopt him, the teen replied: \"Because I love him,\" the order says.</p> <p>A home study by a social worker \"highly\" recommended the guardian and his partner be allowed to adopt the boy, saying the two men provided a \"loving and nurturing home\", provided \"fair and consistent\" discipline and are financially secure, the order says.</p> <p>Miami attorney Alan Mishael, who represents John Doe's guardian, declined to discuss the ruling, since Audlin has not yet published it formally. He said the ruling is less about public policy than the welfare of a former foster child who wants a father of his own.</p> <p>\"This is a case about a young man who already had a permanent guardian, but wanted to have a father,\" Mishael said. \"That's what the case is about. That's all it's about.\"</p> <p>In the ruling, the judge noted that the statute was passed by lawmakers in 1977 amid a politically charged campaign to, as one lawmaker at the time put it, send gay people \"back into the closet\". </p> <p>Audin said the law violates the US Constitution's separation of powers by preventing family court and child welfare judges from deciding - on a case-by-case basis - what is best for a child.</p> <p>\"Contrary to every child welfare principle,\" Audlin wrote, \"the gay adoption ban operates as a conclusive or irrebuttable presumption that ... it is never in the best interest of any adoptee to be adopted by a homosexual,\" Audlin wrote.</p> <p>Florida's prohibition against adoption by gay people has been declared unconstitutional twice in the past.</p>",
  "<p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, gave a <a href=\"http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/factory_farming/lecture_calls_for_dietary_change.aspx\">lecture</a> on Monday night in London in which he pointed out that by halving their meat consumption, people in western countries would do more to reduce their CO2 emissions than if they halved their car usage. Since our addiction to personal transport is hard to break, he suggested people who cared about their children's future might want to gradually move to a few meat-free days.</p> <p>I was on the discussion panel that followed the lecture. He did not preach, this was more of a \"<a href=\"http://www.nudges.org/\">nudge</a>\", that notion that has become fashionable with new <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/08/07/do0701.xml\">Cameroonians</a>.</p> <p>Except it seems even a nudge is too much. The thing I am enjoying about Boris Johnson being mayor of London (there has to be some consolation) is that he is so good at revealing true Tory colours. David Cameron may come over all strong on climate change, but nudge us towards less meat \u2026 you cannot be serious! Johnson's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/09/09/do0901.xml\">Daily Telegraph</a> column yesterday said. (How does he manage to fit it in with his onerous duties running the capital?)</p> <p>Johnson is going to have a series of epic barbecues and called them Pachauri days in satirical homage, because what we actually need, he reckons, is global population control.</p> <blockquote> <p>It's not eating meat that does the damage. It's the huge and remorselessly growing number of people who want to eat it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is the classic Conservative line: it's not us and our consumption or economic activity that's the problem, it's someone else's fault, in this case, again as usual with Conservatives, foreigners who will insist on having too many children.</p> <p>Since he accuses Guardian columnists of not being prepared to mention the difficult issue of population control, here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/29/politics.greenpolitics\">George Monbiot</a> on the subject:</p> <blockquote> <p>Even if there were no environmental pressures caused by population growth, we should still support the measures required to tackle it: universal sex education, universal access to contraceptives, better schooling and opportunities for poor women. Stabilising or even reducing the human population would ameliorate almost all environmental impacts. But to argue that population growth is largely responsible for the ecological crisis is to blame the poor for the excesses of the rich.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Tories though don't do collective action or global social justice. </p> <p>Fortunately, in the audience on Monday night was Johnson's very own new food tsar, Rosie Boycott, who agrees, she told me, that everyone in the west needs to cut down their meat consumption \"because it is completely unsustainable\". </p> <p>We need both collective action and measures to stabilise population to tackle the enormity of the threat from climate change. We also need to tackle the extraordinary concentration of power in the food system that drives our patterns of consumption. </p> <p>One other member of Monday night's discussion panel was the lead author of the enormously influential FAO report <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm\">Livestock's Long Shadow</a>, Dr Henning Steinfeld. Much of Pachauri's argument was based on the work of this report. It pointed out that livestock accounts for roughly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all of transport. How had it been greeted by governments? Well, Steinfeld admitted, the response seems to have been to freeze his department's budget. Much of the funding for the work came from the Danish government \u2013 but since Denmark just happens to be one of the largest producers of industrial pig meat in the world the findings were presumably a little awkward. </p> <p>Will old lefties be any better at tackling vested interests? London food tsar Boycott was astounded to learn just how much CO2 emission there is from a single kilo of beef (the equivalent to driving a car 250km in fact). Translate that into the number of burgers sold at the Beijing Olympics by official caterers McDonald's and it's a mighty contribution to greenhouses gasses she realised. The official caterers to the London Olympics? McD's of course. Will Boycott be talking to them? Yes \"we're hoping in four years' time that McDonald's may be looking at some kind of vegetarian meals and we can aim for fewer emissions\". What a happy meal that would be.</p>",
  "<p>Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, today appeared to soften an attack on the entrenched class system by removing a swath of quotes from her speech to the TUC on the government's new plans to tackle inequality.</p> <p>The equalities minister was expected to say that social class - more than gender, race, sexual orientation or disability - was the main reason why people failed to reach their full potential.</p> <p>\"What overarches all of these is where you live, your family background, your wealth and social class.\"</p> <p>The quotes, briefed in advance, made the lead story in the Daily Telegraph under the headline \"Class war is back as Labour bows to unions\".</p> <p>But today Harman confined herself to two examples - showing how less able six-year-olds from the middle class were already ahead of better able six-year-olds from working-class backgrounds - and showing how very rich men now lived longer than poor women.</p> <p>A Labour spokeswoman said that the main reason for the change was that the minister was speaking from notes and would not necessarily follow the text put out. The spokeswoman insisted that she had not intended to tone down her views.</p> <p>Her main announcement to the TUC was the establishment of a new \"national equality panel\" chaired by Professor John Hills of the London School of Economics.</p> <p>The panel's job will be to discover and help tackle what she called the \"scars of inequality\", with a report due in a year's time to help the government work out the best steps forward.</p> <p>Hills told the Guardian: \"It is not just an issue whether there is a wider gap between the rich and the poor. That is far too simplistic. What we are going to do is to try and map a far more complex picture of differences between and within various groups, from pensioners to those at work, as well as looking at where they live and whether this affects their life chances.</p> <p>\"The information we gather we hope will influence government policy by giving a more accurate picture of what is really happening.\"</p> <p>The rest of Harman's speech was devoted to a savage attack on the Conservatives, a foretaste of a new drive by ministers to try to regain the offensive. </p> <p>The deputy Labour leader accused David Cameron of wanting \"women for one thing and one thing only: their votes\".</p> <p>She accused the Tories of \"sidling up\" to trade unionists, \"lurking around\" equality campaigns, and \"fawning over\" women's groups.</p> <p>\"They are a false friend of equality and fairness,\" she said.</p> <p>Harman's speech drew a strong response from Theresa May, the Tory women's spokesperson.</p> <p>\"Harriet Harman is stuck in the class-warfare rhetoric of 20 years ago. She needs to wake up and realise that this is the 21st century and her party is still failing on equality,\" said May.</p>",
  "<p>Hospitals are running out of effective treatments for superbugs and new drugs are needed to prevent worsening outbreaks, the government body that monitors infectious diseases warned today.</p> <p>The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has called on the pharmaceutical industry to develop new antibiotics to ensure that more hospital infections do not become untreatable. </p> <p>The agency is most worried by the spread of so-called gram-negative bacteria, which can become so resistant to antibiotics they cause untreatable infections. These bacteria, which include E coli, can be fatal for seriously ill patients.</p> <p>Dr David Livermore, laboratory director at the HPA Centre for Infections (CFI), said drug companies needed to develop a new range of treatments for gram-negative bacteria, as they had done for infections such as MRSA.</p> <p>\"Over the last 10 years the pharmaceutical industry has significantly invested in antibiotic treatments for bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA,\" said Livermore. </p> <p>Patients most at risk include those with severe burns, cancer, HIV and chronic lung infections. </p> <p>The drug resistant E coli bacteria, known as Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing E coli, can cause urinary tract infections and blood poisoning.</p> <p>The gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas and Burkholderia already pose a significant threat to patients with cystic fibrosis. </p> <p>There has been a rise in the number of blood poisoning cases caused by pseudomonas reported to the HPA. In the last year there were 3828 compared to 3680 in 2006.</p> <p>There is often only one treatment available for another called Acinetobacter. The number of cases of acinetobacter reported to the HPA have only increased by 5% between 2003 and 2007, from 1126 reports to 1187. It can be spread on wards by person-to-person contact, or contact with contaminated surfaces or medical equipment.</p> <p>Livermore, who will next week address the HPA annual conference about the rise of drug resistant hospital infections, also called for more sensible prescribing of antibiotics. Doctors have been criticised for being too ready to prescribe the drugs for minor infections, with patients then failing to complete the course of treatment. This has led to more bacteria becoming drug resistant.</p> <p>Professor Peter Borriello, director of the CFI, said: \"The problem of antibiotic resistance is likely remain with us for foreseeable future. But the fight against resistance is not futile. Efforts to control the problem will be long and complex but these efforts are already under way.\"</p>",

  "<h2>Wapping decision</h2> <p>Today <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/10/newsinternational.pressandpublishing\"><strong>News International</strong> staff found out that they were staying at Wapping</a> - and for many it ruined their day. But they might be cheered to find out what the architect who is designing their new building, Amanda Levete, of the firm Future Systems, thinks of Fortress Wapping and its gargantuan main building. \"I was drawn to the building by its hidden power and integrity,\" Amanda says. \"News International moved here in 1986 and created history - this is their heritage and that is something you can not design. What we will do now is make the building speak not just of where they have come from, but where they are going.\" Down The Caxton to drown their sorrows, Monkey imagines.</p> <h2>Looking to the Future</h2> <p>The new <strong>News Corporation building</strong> is going to have to be large enough to cope with at least double News International's existing 1,500 staff, when they are joined by other London-based employees of parent company News Corp's extensive European empire. So what will the new Wapping look like? Somewhere between a spaceship and a blob, if architect Amanda Levete is any thing to go by. Levete once worked for Richard Rogers and her firm Future Systems designed the Floating Bridge in London's Docklands, the NatWest Media Centre at Lord's Cricket Ground and the extraordinary new Bullring in Birmingham. Check them out at <a href=\"http://www.future-systems.com\" target=\"_blank\">Future Systems' website</a>.</p> <h2>End looms for NI?</h2> <p>What is becoming clearer is that <strong>News International</strong>, the division that publishes the Sun, News of the World, Sunday Times, the Times and the London Paper, is going to be subsumed into its parent News Corporation. The signs were there when James Murdoch was parachuted in from BSkyB to run NI in December - but given the grand title, chairman and chief executive, Europe and Asia, News Corporation. In today's press release on the Wapping redevelopment he doesn't even mention News International by name, referring only to News Corporation. \"Throughout our history, News Corporation has challenged conventions and we hope this building will provide benefits to the business that can't be found in traditional commercial real estate. Wapping is not only important as a physical site, but also it is a symbol of how bold individuals, working together, can advance the world of media and thereby contribute to life in Britain.\" He makes all those kiss-and-tells sound so lofty.</p>",
  "<p>Environmental campaigners who challenge the law by non-violent action are increasingly being acquitted by juries and magistrates. </p> <p>In the last decade cases involving genetically modified crops, new roads and nuclear, chemical and arms trade companies have all collapsed after protesters argued that they had acted according to their consciences and that they were trying to prevent a greater crime.<br> But this was the first time that climate change activists have been cleared of using a \"lawful excuse\" defence. </p> <p>The increasing number of acquittals has led to protesters acting openly and accountably, rather than covertly, and seeking court cases. A court gives them a stage on which to present complex scientific and ethical arguments.</p> <p>Protesters can play up the amount of damage they have done in order to have their cases heard by juries.</p> <p>In this case, Greenpeace did not question the high cost of \u00a330,000 estimated by Kingsnorth's owners E.ON to clean up the damage done to the chimney. The paint in which they daubed the prime minister's first was water-based and would probably have washed off within weeks. </p> <p>The government is also thought to have wanted the Kingsnorth case to go the highest court possible to deter many expected future protests against coal. </p> <p>Hundreds of people have already pledged to take direct action against the building of new coal-fired power stations. This verdict is likely to encourage them.

  "<p>The government this week launched more than 180 new schools around England including 47 privately sponsored academies. Some of these schools are involved in controversial and radical re-thinking of how to educate children in the poorest areas of the country. The Guardian obtained exclusive access to three of the new schools to witness the reality of New Labour's school revolution. </p> <h2>Esther Addley: Evelyn Grace Academy, Brixton</h2> <p>\"Excellence, endeavour and self-discipline\" are the buzz words on this, the very first morning of Evelyn Grace Academy in Brixton, south London. Just to remind year seven, filing into the brand new assembly hall in their oversized blazers and fat, new ties, large posters displaying the motto have been hung around the hall.</p> <p>It is barely 9am, but already the 170 students have been instructed on these key virtues, along with sitting up straight, maintaining eye contact, standing in poker-straight lines, sitting only when told to do so and maintaining absolute silence. Crooked ties and non-regulation socks are not permissible in the hall.</p> <p>It is a demanding set of standards for these small 11-year-olds, who only moments ago were hovering shyly next to their parents at the school gates. But for head teacher Peter Walker and his team, the ethos of \"100%\" \u2014 another Evelyn Grace motto \u2014 means enforcing every one of the school's lofty principles from the very first moment. </p> <p>Situated next to one of south London's most notorious sink estates, the school aspires to be a haven of order, aspiration and strict discipline. And peering in at the gates, parents repeatedly declare themselves impressed by its tough love. \"I'm from the old school,\" says one. \"The more boundaries the better.\"</p> <p>Evelyn Grace is sponsored by Ark, a children's charity that this week doubled its tally of London schools to six. A further two are in development. </p> <p>The charity is the creation of the billionaire hedge fund manager Arpad Busson, and the beneficiary of lavish annual fundraising galas that in recent years have hosted Sting, Bill Clinton and Stevie Wonder. </p> <p>The charity, which stands for \"absolute return for kids\", applies its City values of targeted investment and high expectations of return to deprived children in India, South Africa, eastern Europe \u2013 and, from this week, Brixton.</p> <p>Present at this morning's opening is the fund manager David Gorton, who, thanks to an eye-watering seven-figure personal donation, is the school's \"sponsor and key governor\". \"Work hard, make good friends, have fun, and smile!\" he tells the students. No one has mentioned fun before. </p> <p>It is thanks to Ark funding that Evelyn Grace can offer its version of value-added education. The school day runs from 8.30am to 5pm, appreciated equally by parents, mindful of security, and, perhaps surprisingly, the students themselves. The hours after 3pm will be devoted to sport, music and academic catch-up sessions. </p> <p>Teachers will receive additional support from specialists working across the Ark family. Meanwhile the permanent buildings for the new school are already under construction \u2013 designed by Zaha Hadid. </p> <p>It's an impressive, and enviable set-up. But isn't there something faintly unsettling about very rich people setting the terms by which poor students are educated? </p> <p>\"I see this as an opportunity to actually create something in a local community where there is a need for a good school,\" says Walker, previously the director of the government's secondary schools' strategy programme. \"I think there are issues about ... ignoring the opportunity to use people who want to put their money into something.\" While he might have difficulties with some academy groups, he says: \"With Ark there is an educational vision that I feel comfortable with.\"</p> <p>That vision might be summed up as small-scale schooling. With Walker as overall principal, the academy has been divided into two \"small schools\", each with its own head (eventually there will be four). </p> <p>Students are organised into learning groups of 10, each headed by an adult leader whom they will see every day and eat lunch with twice a week. </p> <p>Such levels of contact will allow the management team to give any student who struggles the support they need, he believes. And what will make this school a success? \"We want all children to achieve five Cs at GCSE, including English and Maths.\" Every child? \"Yes.\"</p> <p>In the culture of 100%, nothing less will do. </p> <h2>Martin Wainwright: Oasis Academy Media City UK, Salford</h2> <p>Something changed in Salford this week, as the usual gaggles of school students headed past Buile Hill park on the first day of term.</p> <p>Last year they were white-shirted or maybe with the black sweaters of Hope High school looped round their waists.</p> <p>From now on, the gear is black blazers, trousers or skirt, red tie and a breast pocket badge saying Oasis Academy Media City UK.</p> <p>\"It is a bit of a mouthful,\" admits the new academy's principal, Dave Terry, before briefing staff on their latest ride on the roller coaster previously known as Hope. \"But now we have certainty. That is the great thing. Now we can accelerate improvements. That's what the academy has given the community, our students and staff.\"</p> <p>Terry couples the word \"community\" with the school on every possible occasion, aware that academies are sometimes portrayed as \"different\" and therefore at odds with other state high schools. He guarantees \"absolutely no selection on ability\", although the academies have a limited right to do that, and no exclusions either.</p> <p>There were 15 two years ago and one last year (for a criminal offence). In future, he says, there should be none.</p> <p>The medium-term outlook for Salford's Oasis is stunning. In three years' time, the 650-odd pupils move into state-of-the-art new buildings on Salford Quays, the \"MediaCity\" of the school's new name. Their neighbours, and partners in work experience and interactive teaching, will include the new northern base of the BBC and dozens of freelance media firms.</p> <p>It will be a 1.8 mile hop, but Terry intends to take his mixed, and in part very challenging, catchment with him, adding new pupils to fill the extra space, with a sixth form for the first time. Meanwhile, he gets most pleasure from the transformation of tatty old Hope's existing buildings, which are half a century old and looked it \u2013 until this term.</p> <p>Outside, academy status is little more than bright new signs and some flags, but through the classroom door it is a different matter. Room after room is bright with fresh paint, student work on the walls alongside aspirational slogans and, most important, stacks of IT gear which a modern media company would envy.</p> <p>\"We needed investment, finance and resource in these buildings, now, to give the community faith in us,\" says Terry, who was appointed head of Hope three years ago, when it was on Ofsted's failing school list. Six weeks after he started, a planned PFI new-build was dropped by Salford council. The roller coaster either had to crash or go up.</p> <p>It went up. First by Terry fishing in every available budget pond, then through the work of a reinvigorated \u2013 but little-changed \u2013 staff. One of them, Paresh Shah, takes his new year sevens through GCSE results: 32 per cent got A-Cs two years ago, he tells the class with a long face; then up it went to 55 last year (a bit of a smile). What's the target next time? Up shoots a perky lad's arm: \"75 to 80 per cent, sir.\" \"Yes,\" (with a big beam).</p> <p>\"I've been here a long, long time now and this has refreshed me,\" says Shah. \"The IT and learning facilities are fantastic. I've taught in this classroom for a good while, and everything's new. The vision is great. It's going to be a good year. We're going to have fun.\"</p> <p>Fun and faith. Oasis, which has ten academies up and running or planned, is a Christian network founded by Steve Chalke, an evangelical Baptist in the religious tradition of getting stuck in to social problems. The group's subtitle is \"community learning\".</p> <p>\"They are people who want to concentrate on making things better in this part of the world,\" says Terry, who is not a believer but has met no problems on that account. \"Faith for us means faith in people. Whether your faith comes from God or humanitarianism, the outcome is what matters.\"</p> <h2>Polly Curtis: RSA Academy, Tipton</h2> <p>At the best of times the first lesson after the long summer holidays can feel unending, but at the RSA Academy in Tipton that feeling is even more justified because the lessons are three-hours long. </p> <p>Three-hour lessons, a longer day and school year and 90 pupils to a class makes the RSA Academy sound like a boot camp. But they've also scrapped homework, subject areas and streaming and are using a progressive curriculum designed to train pupils in the skills and competencies that will serve for life before they learn the facts and figures that will get them through a GCSE. </p> <p>\"Our pupils become more competent learners. They will be much more well-rounded, not just better at exams but better at understanding the world, their community and about tolerance,\" says the schools' principle, Michael Gernon.</p> <p>The lessons are based on a curriculum called Opening Minds developed by the school's sponsor the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). Three-hour lessons mean they do a whole project in a morning, instead of over a week. Pupils rarely sit still for long and textbooks are practically banned. Instead they learn skills in communication, managing themselves, working in teams and understanding their responsibilities.</p> <p>Tipton's children are largely white, working class and poor. The school abuts a large estate known locally as the Lost City, because with only one road linking it to the rest of the world it's easy to lose yourself in its labyrinthine streets. \"People who grow up here don't leave. There are long-held attitudes. Education isn't a priority and we need to change that,\" says Gernon. </p> <p>On the first day of the school year seven pupils are putting together a learning calendar where they will record their aims and achievements through the year. They learn to take digital photos and produce individual calendars from the piles of mini notebooks around the room. The 90 pupils in the class take turns to do tasks and have three teachers present at all times. </p> <p>Their teacher, Rebecca Richardson, says the large classes are not a problem. \"It's fine. You've just got to have good classroom control. You could teach 120 in a class if you wanted.\"</p> <p>The year eight pupils love having no homework \u2013 a slightly longer day means their evenings are their own \u2013 and point out that three-hour lessons mean they don't spend their days traipsing from one class to another. They even like the new school term arrangement admitting that the six-week summers got boring. </p> <p>One year eight girl says: \"I really like going to a private academy. Everybody wants to go here now. People think you're dead posh because you come from a privately run academy but really we're not. People think it's like a private school.\"</p> <p>It was exactly this sentiment that the Blair government wanted academies to inspire and the RSA Academy is more Blairite than most. Its head, Matthew Taylor, was Blair's chief policy advisor up until 2006.</p> <p>Gernon says they are not a political institution but they do have high ambitions. \"As far as we're concerned our role is to create a blueprint for a new educational system,\" he says. \"We want to start a different way of learning, which breeds success but still meets all the accountability measures so we can prove you can break out of the shackles of the national curriculum and get away from the fear of league tables. It's a big statement, I know it is. But that's our mission.\"</p>",
  "<p>American voters are driven to the polls by issues ranging from lagging house prices to the war in Iraq. But how many are angry about a $239,000 cheque to teach Girl Scouts math and science and $1.6m to study a disease afflicting grapevines? </p> <p>One of the central themes of Republican presidential nominee John McCain's campaign is his crusade against so-called \"pork barrel\" spending, a practice by which legislators secure federal funding for projects in their home districts by attaching relatively small items to the legislation that allocates the federal budget.</p> <p>McCain describes the practice of earmarking, as it is formally known in the legislative process, as verging on corrupt, and sees it as wasteful spending by legislators who are profligate with taxpayer money. </p> <p>Among his favourite examples: A $223m \"bridge to nowhere\" linking a sparsely-populated island in Alaska, his running mate Sarah Palin's home state, and a $4.8m project to study bears in Montana. </p> <p>McCain pledges that if he is elected president, he will end the practice and bring notoriety to the 97 senators and more than 95% of the 435 members of the House of Representatives who bring federal money back to their districts. </p> <p>\"I'll take this old ink pen and every single pork barrel earmark bill that comes across my desk as president, I will veto it,\" McCain said at a campaign rally in Ohio yesterday. \"I will make them famous and you will know their names. You will know their names.\"</p> <p>Projects not mentioned by McCain include $6.4m to digitise FBI investigative files, $22m for a mess hall for soldiers in Montana, and $81,000 for construction and renovation of a hospital in Utah. Legislators have allocated $5.7bn for transportation infrastructure needs.</p> <p>In all, the categories of earmarks McCain is keen on eliminating total about $30bn, or roughly one percent of the federal budget.</p> <p>\"People think that there's a good deal of waste in the federal government, and they would like to see somebody do something about it,\" said Scott Lilly, former Democratic staff director of the congressional committee that oversees federal budgeting and now a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress, a liberal research group. </p> <p>\"But the fact is that, the vast majority of these things that he called earmarks are not particularly wasteful\".</p> <p>McCain's crusade again congressional earmarks excites Republican activists who would curtail the federal budget. But McCain is the first presidential candidate to make the topic a central campaign theme, and it is unclear how the theme will play with voters as the US economy plunges headlong into an economic downturn, making local governments more dependent than ever on federal largess.</p> <p>\"The earmark issue riles most voters as wasteful government spending and a corruption of the process,\" said Thomas Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. </p> <p>\"But voters have little understanding of how trivial the sums involved are, relative to overall spending and the size of the deficit. Nonetheless, promises to abolish earmarks are no substitute for a real economic policy that might actually have some effect on a sick economy and on the well-being of those harmed by economic forces.\"</p> <p>Some political observers say that McCain's aggressive talk on the earmark spending is a proxy for his anti-Washington campaign and his pledge to shake up the nation's capital and change its ways, even while he has been in Congress for 26 years.</p> <p>McCain and running mate Palin \"define Washington as filed with people who enjoy spending other people's money\", said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organisation. </p> <p>\"So if you're trying to appear to be the anti-Washington, outside maverick who will bring change, this is a good pithy way of promoting it.\"</p> <p>Robin Kolodny, a political scientist at Temple University in Philadelphia, said McCain's cry on earmarks allows him to sound in control of the federal budget when his chief selling points to voters are his military background and his reputation as an independent operator, not his command of the economy.</p> <p>\"He's already exposed himself as being fuzzy on the details of the economy, so all he's trying to do is to say 'I've got a plan and I think we can make this all work if we just cut out some of these wasteful projects',\" she said.</p> <p>Lilly of the Centre for American Progress said McCain's talk on earmarks largely flies over the head of many voters, who are not sophisticated about the way the federal budget works.</p> <p>\"A lot of people don't quite get what he's talking about,\" he said. \"The term 'earmarks' is not something that is in the lexicon of the majority of voters.\"</p> <p>Most members of Congress and doubtless many voters see earmarks, or at least those in their areas, not as waste but as a benefit.</p> <p>\"'Pork' is spending in your district, not in mine,\" said Ornstein, quipping on the derisive term for the practice.</p>",
  "<p>North Korea today dismissed reports about the ill health of Kim Jong-il as a \"conspiracy plot\" amid fresh claims from South Korea that the supreme leader is recovering from surgery.</p> <p>Kim's absence yesterday from celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea fuelled speculation about his health.</p> <p>Senior officials took the rare step of granting interviews to a foreign news outlet in an attempt to end weeks of rumours.</p> <p>North Korea's second-in-command, Kim Yong-nam, said there was \"no problem\" with the leader, while Song Il-ho, a senior North Korean diplomat, told Japan's Kyodo news agency that rumours of ill-health were \"not true\". </p> <p>\"We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot,\" he said.</p> <p>South Korea's intelligence agency today reported to a parliamentary committee that it had obtained reports showing Kim had recently undergone surgery for a circulatory problem and that his condition had greatly improved.</p> <p>South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing committee members briefed by the agency, reported that the 66-year-old Kim suffered a cerebral haemorrhage but remained conscious and \"is able to control the situation\".</p> <p>The committee was told that Kim was in a \"recoverable and manageable condition\" and that the north was not in a \"power vacuum,\" Yonhap said.</p> <p>Analysts have said Kim - who has not been seen in public since mid-August - can drop out of sight for months, but it is unusual for him to miss major events such as yesterday's anniversary.</p> <p>His condition is of particular concern internationally given that there is no clear line of succession and Pyongyang recently resumed its nuclear programme, blaming the United States for leaving it on a terrorism blacklist despite an agreement of better relations in exchange for disarmament.</p> <p>The deal was hammered out with the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, but Washington said North Korea would have to agree to an inspection system before it could be removed from the list.</p> <p>Analysts fear that the military, known to be hostile to denuclearisation, might gain the upper hand in the event of Kim's death.</p> <p>There are concerns about the stability of the desperately impoverished state, which faces a food crisis.</p> <p>The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, convened an emergency meeting in Seoul today to discuss the situation with senior aides, an official said.</p> <p>Kim inherited his position from his father, Kim Il-sung, the country's founder, making it the world's first communist dynasty.

  "<p>I know the last thing we need right now is another North American election to worry about. Just as the coverage of the US election reaches saturation point in Europe, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7602864.stm\">announced</a> that Canada will go to the polls on October 14, in an attempt by Harper to increase the ruling conservative party's position to a majority government. And we should be worried.</p> <p>The US election obviously matters to Europeans - the last eight years have shown us how much of a stake the rest of us have in who America chooses as its next leader on November 4. What we might forget, in the next two months of North American election campaigning, is how much the Canadian election matters too.</p> <p>The lack of interest abroad in Canada's national politics is striking - probably partly a perennial stereotype of Canada as peaceful (read: boring) country, partly because the last eight years have required a heightened focus on the big bag of crazy that the institutional politics of Canada's southern neighbour has become. No one has benefited from this more than <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/harper_stephen/\">Harper</a>: outside of Canada, there's barely been a mention of the fact that even calling this election is a violation of his earlier electoral promise to set fixed election dates, to stop politicians calling elections whenever they're in a favourable position in the polls (can you guess why Harper called the election now?).</p> <p>In Britain we seem to be inured to how bizarre and undemocratic it is for leaders to be able to pick an election date. Harper's outright flip-flopping on the issue makes the whole problem transparent - and, sure enough, the likely outcome of the October election will be a majority Conservative government in Canada.</p> <p>The broken pledge on fixed elections is just the latest dubious act from Harper, a man who has dismissed the Kyoto Protocol as a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/01/30/harper-kyoto.html\">\"socialist\" enterprise</a> with no purpose other than to punish rich nations, acquiesced to George Bush's war on terror, culled funding for <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061004/tories_women_061004/20061004?hub=Politics\">women's advocacy programmes</a> and accepted same-sex marriages only after members of his own party <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061207/samesexmarriage_vote_061207/20061207?hub=TopStories\">voted against him</a> on a motion to \"restore the traditional definition of marriage\". For a prime minister with a powerless minority government, he's managed to do an almost impressive amount of damage since coming to power two years ago, damage that - particularly on environmental issues - has an impact far beyond Canada.</p> <p>Some have argued that, even if you don't like Harper, a majority government of any kind is better than the current gridlock. Others have argued that it doesn't matter - that, being \"right or left wing in Canadian politics has come to mean as little as being left- or right-handed for a tennis serve\", that the main parties <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20060206_121010_121010\">compete for the centre</a>. But this ignores how odious Harper could be when no longer reined in by his enfeebled parliamentary position.</p> <p>If you care about the American election because you're scared of Sarah Palin's scepticism toward global warming, you should worry about Harper's unwillingness to continue his predecessor's work against climate change. If you hated George Bush because of his government's corrosion of civil liberties at home and abroad, the fact that Harper has been a thorough Bush apologist is a worrying indicator of how a full-fledged Conservative government would encroach on the rights of Canadians.</p> <p>Although Harper's agenda in the event of a majority government is still unclear, his record is a worrying indicator of the way things will go: to the list of anti-gay rights, anti-women and anti-environmental positions, we can add legislative changes giving Canada's immigration department unprecedented powers to reject immigration applications, as well as setting back truly universal childcare plans in favour of <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060502/budget_childcare_060502?s_name=&amp;no_ads=\">childcare \"allowances\"</a>. His foreign policy record is more of a question mark, but during the minority government Harper extended the pledge of Canada's troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. If John McCain is elected after Harper wins a majority, and decides another Middle Eastern country is looking at him the wrong way, is there enough in Harper's record to reassure us that he wouldn't bring Canada into an American-led invasion?</p> <p>So, with so much potentially at stake, why are we so uninterested in Canada's politics? Admittedly, even if Canada elected Conrad Black himself it would never be able to drag Britain into an illegal war - but is the fact that America has such an obvious impact on our lives the only reason we cover American politics so extensively in Europe? Is that really the reason the media here covers hurricanes only when they effect the US? The reason people watch The Wire? Surely Britons would at least claim we care about American politics because we also care about the lives of ordinary Americans, in and of themselves, and Barack Obama's and John McCain's domestic policies are reported extensively here. We're more concerned, obviously, with whether the next US president will invade another country than improve the domestic literacy rate, but we care about the US literacy rate too.<br> But even Canada's foreign policy, never mind its literacy rate, is largely ignored by the European media. Even before and beyond Harper, Canada's role in the war on terror has barely been scrutinised abroad - perhaps in part because its politics inconveniently ruptures neat periodisation. While 2001-2007 meant, for us, George Bush and Tony Blair, Canadians have gone through three prime ministers in this time.</p> <p>But it's perhaps due more to the way the rest of us buy wholesale into Canada's carefully crafted self-identity as the good-guys. After 9/11, Canada's good-guy image and the perceived rightness of the Afghanistan war were implicitly mutually reinforcing. Canada is a famously peaceful nation so, the implied reasoning went, the war in Afghanistan must be just because the mission was led by the nation of progressive liberals (even after 2006, when Canada elected Harper, they did this mainly because the Liberal party was eating itself while the Bloc Quebecois split the opposition votes. Canada's heart is still, generally, liberal). It often feels that Canada isn't treated as a nation so much as a totem, a moral barometer for western liberals elsewhere. Another mutually reinforcing binary: the not-Americans; the good-guys.</p> <p>This lazy equation was ruptured in the early 2000s, while progressives were too busy blaming America for all the world's evils to notice the complicity of the good-guys to the north. The incarceration and torture of Canadian citizen <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.ca/human_rights_issues/maher_arar_overview.php\">Maher Arar</a> at the hands of US authorities, and the Guant\u00e1namo detention of the Canadian minor <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/khadr/omar-khadr.html\">Omar Khadr</a>, were met with silence by the Liberals in Ottawa - the supposed good-guys in a nation of good-guys.</p> <p>The point here is not to paint Canada's response to the new realities of the 2000s as on par with Britain's or America's actions in these years. Of course there's an element truth at the heart of the crafted myth of Canada's liberal identity. I wouldn't have moved there for a year if there weren't. And of course it can feel difficult, as a British person opposed to the Iraq war, to criticise a country that had the strength not to be dragged into it.</p> <p>But, with all respect for that, perhaps it's time to recognise how the assumption that Canada is a problem-free good-guy nation is not only patronising to those who live there with far from problem-free lives \u2013 but also leaves, until we begin to unpick this assumption, a missing piece in our understanding of how the last seven years were allowed to happen.<br> If Obama wins the election less than a month after the Canadian election, the almost-unthinkable will happen: for the first time in generations, Canada will have a government that is more conservative than its southern neighbour. And perhaps that's what will restore America's reputation in Europe more than all the promises of hope and change: the day <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6666338/\">Canadian tourists put American flags</a> on their backpacks so that you'll treat them nicely.</p>",
  "<p>General Ray Odierno, the former second-in-command of US troops in Iraq, is to return to Baghdad next week to take over from General David Petraeus as the top general.</p> <p>Odierno, who will be promoted to four-star general, was a relative latecomer to the hearts and minds counterinsurgency techniques of Petraeus.</p> <p>During his first stint in Iraq, when he commanded the 4th Infantry Division in 2003, Odierno was responsible for an area north of Baghdad known as the Sunni triangle, which included Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's home town. </p> <p>Few US military commanders or soldiers have much good to say about Odierno's aggressive tactics. His division's mistreatment of Iraqis and the heavy use of artillery appalled others within the country's armed forces. </p> <p>Army reporters and commanders said Odierno's unit - a heavy armoured division, despite its name \u2013 used an iron-fist strategy that may have appeared to pacify the area in the short term, but alienated large parts of the population. Some argue that the behaviour of the 4th Infantry Division helped create the insurgency.</p> <p>\"Fourth ID fuelled the insurgency,\" an army psychological operations officer told Thomas Ricks in his book on the Iraq war, Fiasco. An unnamed general said bluntly: \"The 4th ID \u2013 what they did was a crime.\"</p> <p>Odierno has defended his troops' conduct by saying his men faced a population more hostile than in the rest of Iraq and had to act accordingly. The capture by Saddam in an underground bunker in December 2003 by Odierno's soldiers did little to dispel their cowboy image. </p> <p>The division's tactics contrasted with those of Petraeus, whose troops complemented searches of ex-Baathists' homes with meetings with tribal chiefs and community projects such as rebuilding schools and painting over old murals of Saddam Hussein. Petraeus went on to <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf\">rewrite the US military's counterinsurgency manual (pdf)</a> and then took overall command in Iraq.</p> <p>Odierno, who finished a 15-month stint as the second in charge in February, was slow in recognising the strength of the insurgency at the start of 2004. At the time, he told reporters that the insurgents had been \"brought to their knees\". He was not alone in his overconfidence. A few months later, violence erupted and US forces all but ceded control of places such as Fallujah to the rebels.</p> <p>Later in 2004, the war took a brutally personal twist for Odierno. His son, Tony, an army lieutenant at the time, lost an arm to a rocket-propelled grenade. A West Point graduate, the younger Odierno left the army and went to graduate school in New York.</p> <p>For the older Odierno, Iraq was unfinished business. He returned in late 2006 and redeemed himself by recognising the failings of the US strategy at the time, recommending more troops at a time when the White House was under enormous political pressure to withdraw forces. </p> <p>\"His recommendations for what came to be known as the surge forces have since been proven correct,\" Petraeus said at a ceremony in Baghdad marking the end of Odierno's last tour in February.</p> <p>Odierno seems to have adopted the Petraeus approach, telling troops that it is their job to protect the population and that counter-insurgency takes time. </p> <p>When he takes up his new post he will answer to Petraeus, who will take over in late October as chief of US central command, which oversees US military involvement in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the rest of central Asia. Odierno and Petraeus know each other well: for the final 12 months of Odierno's time in Baghdad his immediate superior was Petraeus.</p> <p>Odierno will be taking over at a time of relative calm. The surge has contributed to a big drop in sectarian violence and the newly confident Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is keen to see the withdrawal of all US combat troops by 2010, although he will probably have to settle for a compromise of 2011.</p> <p>George Bush yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/iraq.usa\">announced a withdrawal of 8,000 US combat troops by February</a>, but that would still leave his successor with about 140,000 troops \u2013 roughly the same as the pre-surge levels of last February. It will be Odierno's job to ensure that the gains of the past year are not reversed and to set the stage for an eventual US withdrawal.</p> <p>Odierno's margin for manoeuvre could depend not only what happens on the ground, but on who wins the US presidential race. He favours a \"conditions-based\" approach to judging US troop requirements in Iraq, taking into account levels of violence, the strength of insurgent groups and changes in the quality and numbers of Iraqi government troops. John McCain, the Republican candidate, backs such an approach, whereas Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, wants a firm timetable.</p>",
  "<p>A British soldier who shot dead a colleague in Iraq while playing with a loaded sniper rifle was today jailed for two years. </p> <p>Aarron Kendrick, 20, shot Edward Vakabua, a 23-year-old Fijian, in the head with the rifle in a bunk room at Basra Palace on July 6 last year.<br> Kendrick, of 4th Battalion the Rifles, was not trained to handle the weapon, which belonged to a sniper who had left the room. </p> <p>As a joke he cocked it, aimed it at Vakabua and pulled the trigger. The bullet struck the soldier as he lay on his bed. Colleagues tried to save him but he died within minutes. </p> <p>Kendrick, based at Warminster, in Wiltshire, admitted to negligently discharging an L96 sniper rifle but denied manslaughter. A board of five army officers found him guilty at a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, last week. </p> <p>Sentencing him today, judge advocate Jack Bayliss ordered the soldier to serve 16 months of the sentence at a military detention centre at Colchester known as the Glass House.</p> <p>The judge said the board had decided not to dismiss Kendrick from the army and it would be the decision of his commanding officer whether to take him back after the completion of his sentence. </p> <p>\"Your most culpable act was to point the weapon at another soldier lying in his bunk and pulling the trigger. You were taught that you never point a weapon at anyone in jest or in the course of mucking about,\" Bayliss said. </p> <p>\"We are left with no option but to conclude that only a significant custodial sentence can be justified. It was dangerous and reckless and an act which has cost another young man his life, devastated two families and lost the army a good young soldier.\"</p> <p>The court martial heard that the shooting happened while Kendrick's unit was preparing for an operation at Basra Palace, which had been turned into the battalion's headquarters. The soldier had been allowed to mess about with the rifle by a sniper colleague.</p> <p>Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, said Kendrick \"in jest\" pointed the gun at Vakabua, which he called \"the cardinal sin of weapon handling\".</p> <p>Recalling the incident, Kendrick said in evidence: \"I squeezed the trigger and there was a bang. I thought 'What the fuck?' I dropped the weapon. I remember running up to Rifleman Vakabua and that's as far as I remember.\" </p> <p>Kendrick had served nearly three years in the army prior to the shooting and had been awarded the Iraq medal for his service in the country. </p> <p>Today, the court was read a statement by the commanding officer of 4th Battalion the Rifles, Colonel Patrick Sanders, who said the soldier had shown \"deep remorse, guilt and shame\" over what had happened. </p> <p>\"His reaction at the scene and his subsequent behaviour and demeanour suggested to me that he was and remained appalled at being responsible for the death of a fellow rifleman and friend,\" the statement said.</p> <p>\"At no stage did he try to deflect blame and he assumed full responsibility for his actions and the consequences of it. I believe he will carry the burden of responsibility for the rest of his life.\"</p> <p>In a statement through his solicitor, Kendrick said today: \"I have always accepted that I was responsible for the appalling consequences and I have to live with the memories of that incident and the aftermath. I am ashamed that my handling of the weapon resulted in Edward's death and I will carry that responsibility for the rest of my life.\"</p>",

In the meantime, here's the first full length trailer for Quantum of Solace, featuring our first proper look at Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, and Olga Kurylenko as Camille.<br></p> <p>What we know so far about Quantum of Solace is that it picks up straight after the end of Casino Royale, with Bond damaged and dangerous following the death of Vesper Lynd. The hunt for the organisation which blackmailed and eventually killed her leads him to Austria, Italy and South America, where Greene is involved in a plot to control the continent's water supply. That man you see being interrogated by Bond at the start is Mr White, the villain 007 tracked down to his villa on the shores of Lake Como in the final scene of Casino Royale.</p> <p>It's always hard to read much from a trailer, but the film looks to have maintained its predecessor's darker tone under new director Marc Forster. And Craig is looking more and more like the perfect Bond for this particular strand of the secret agent's ongoing adventures: apart from anything else, he seems to have aged visibly in the last two years, usefully matching the scarring effect of his character's recent experiences.</p> <p>Quantum of Solace is out here on October 31, although the London film festival has just announced it will present the first public screening directly after the movie's world premiere in Leicester Square on October 29.

  "<p>Talks aimed at forming a government of national unity to end Zimbabwe's political crisis resumed today amid optimism that a deal is imminent.</p> <p>The president, Robert Mugabe, and the main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, were relatively upbeat when they emerged late yesterday from negotiations mediated by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki.</p> <p>The state-owned Herald newspaper reported today that there was <a href=\"http://www.herald.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=157&amp;cat=12\">optimism about reaching a solution</a> to the key stumbling block, namely who should have the top position in government. The newspaper said the three parties involved were confident the talks would end today with a \"conclusive political settlement\". </p> <p>Tsvangirai has insisted on being head of government and chairing cabinet meetings, with Mugabe in the largely ceremonial position of head of state. But Mugabe is unwilling to surrender much of the power he has wielded since the country declared independence from Britain in 1980.</p> <p>\"We are still going to talk. There is progress and lack of it. There are principally one or two areas that need to be finalised,\" Mugabe was quoted as saying by the Herald as he left a Harare hotel late yesterday after four hours of negotiations.</p> <p>Tsvangirai said: \"There's been a positive development.\"</p> <p>The Herald, a government mouthpiece, said Mugabe had told Tsvangirai he would form a new government by the end of the week regardless of the outcome of the talks.</p> <p>Some reports suggested Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change was proposing that its leader should become prime minister, with authority over ministers, while Mugabe would chair a new national security council, with control over some of the security forces.</p> <p>Tsvangirai's party won the most votes in legislative and presidential elections in March. Mugabe was the only candidate to take part in a presidential run-off vote that followed an onslaught of state-sponsored violence against Tsvangirai supporters and was widely denounced as a sham.</p> <p>Since then, Mugabe, 84, has faced pressure to reach a deal with the opposition as the only way of breaking the political deadlock and halting economic collapse.</p> <p>The government of Swaziland, which currently chairs the Southern African Development Community's safety and security committee, had scheduled a summit-level meeting on Zimbabwe today with Mugabe and Mbeki. The South African government said the meeting had been pushed back to tomorrow, and that Mbeki was still expected to brief participants on his mediation efforts.</p> <p>The SADC has so far taken a soft approach on Mugabe in its official statements, but sharp public rebukes from member states such as Zambia and Botswana have shattered the traditional African unity.</p> <p>In his first major speech since negotiations began, Tsvangirai said at a party rally on Sunday that Mugabe should accept a ceremonial presidency or \"let's go for elections under international supervision and see who will carry the day\".</p> <p>\"We should not be pushed into a deal,\" Tsvangirai said. \"We would rather have no deal than get a bad deal.\"</p>",
  "<p>Television programmes such as the Jeremy Kyle Show undermine support for government anti-poverty programmes by presenting the less well-off as \"undeserving\" objects of derision, a thinktank said today.</p> <p>A report published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while the Jeremy Kyle Show presents itself as a programme about relationships, \"it could be viewed as a rather brutal form of entertainment that is based on derision of the lower-working-class population\".</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/bookshop/details.asp?pubID=976\">The media, poverty and public opinion in the UK,</a> cited the programme as an example of the negative depiction of poverty in the media. </p> <p>Other programmes, like the Secret Millionaire, were praised for their positive influence.</p> <p>The report said that, although the participants on the Jeremy Kyle Show were not explicitly selected because they were living in poverty, they were nevertheless, with few exceptions, strongly identified as working class.</p> <p>\"They speak with strong regional accents (occasionally even strong regional dialects), they dress in very non-glamorous ways (at times bordering on the scruffy), they often display an almost total lack of the kind of cultural capital that might moderate the behaviour of others on television, but above all they appear to be entirely bereft of the kind of social capital that might assist them in finding solutions to their problems, which do not involve them airing them publicly in front of both the studio audience and the viewers,\" the report said.</p> <p>\"In other words, while any economic poverty they <br>might suffer from is never mentioned, their poverty in a range of other forms of capital is an essential element \u2013 perhaps even the essential element \u2013 in their display.\"</p> <p>The report strongly criticised the way participants are treated on the programme.<br> \"This is entertainment at its crudest, where those lacking a range of social resources are put on display in a form of gladiatorial combat for the entertainment of others,\" it said.</p> <p>\"The inference to be drawn is that those without (those experiencing poverty) are not like us and are not deserving of what we have. Public support for anti-poverty measures is that bit more difficult to achieve when programmes such as the Jeremy Kyle Show continue to present those less fortunate in society as undeserving objects to be used for the purpose of public entertainment.\"</p> <p>In the section on on-screen depictions of poverty, the report praised the Secret Millionaire, a reality TV programme that involves a participant spending time with the less-well off before revealing him or herself to be a millionaire philanthropist willing to donate money to them.</p> <p>\"It could be argued that the Secret Millionaire is but a form of poverty tourism and that it reinforces the control and influence of economically powerful groups over those experiencing poverty,\" the report said.</p> <p>\"Undoubtedly, these criticisms are valid to some extent. However, the contribution these programmes make in engendering a more positive portrayal of poverty in the UK should not be underestimated.\"</p> <p>The report said that, although there were negative and positive depictions of poverty on television, what was \"entirely missing\" was \"working-class (or even lower-middle class) poverty in any meaningful sense, ie people who do not descend into petty (or large-scale) criminality\".</p> <p>The report called for the news and entertainment media to concentrate more on the causes and consequences of poverty.</p> <p>\"The evidence reviewed tends to suggest that, on the whole, coverage of poverty is a peripheral item in newspapers, news magazines, radio and TV news, and entertainment television,\" the report concluded.</p> <p>\"It is not so much the case that poverty per se is absent from the UK mass media, rather that it is rarely explored directly and critically. Poverty tends to be a tool that is used to lend weight to a wider argument that is being pursued. Such coverage as exists tends neither to explore the causes of poverty nor to demonstrate its consequences.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Jeremy Kyle show responded, \"It is unfortunate that this report presents a one-dimensional view of our programme. The Jeremy Kyle Show does not seek to 'deride' any particular social class or portray any group of people as 'undeserving objects'. On the contrary, it focuses on real people with real problems addressing conflict in their lives, problems which reflect genuine issues within society, and seeks to help them achieve a resolution. We do this both within the programmes and with the support of an aftercare team comprised of qualified mental health nurses and a psychotherapist.\"<br> \"In addition, we are puzzled by the references to our guests' 'non-glamorous' appearance and 'strong regional' accents. The show does not seek to influence the way our guests dress or speak and we believe it would be wrong to do so. \"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 11 2008. A spokesman for the Jeremy Kyle show gave a response after the article above was published online. This has been added.</p>",

Photograph: Louis Lanzano/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louis Lanzano/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Copyright disputes seldom hit the headlines, but when a famous author is involved things are different. There has been much coverage of <a href=\"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/case/rowling-v-rdr-books\">JK Rowling's legal case in New York</a>, which she won this week to prevent publication of a 400-page Harry Potter \"Lexicon\" by Steven Vander Ark. One surprising aspect of the coverage has been the reaction of some commentators to the stand she took. <br><br>For many years JK Rowling has rightly been feted for doing so much to encourage the enjoyment of books. However, over the last few months some observers have suggested that she has been a bit precious in trying to stop publication of a book that would probably not harm Harry Potter sales and might even increase them. In my view we should applaud a writer who is prepared to give time and energy to protecting copyright, which these days is so often infringed with careless impunity. For most authors the practicalities of pursuing copyright infringers can be dauntingly complicated and expensive. Here was an author willing to stand up and be counted.</p> <p>It is sometimes assumed that authors favour tougher copyright protection, not least because their livelihoods depend on the advances and royalties they earn from it. However, many writers - including scholars, biographers and historians - want to be able to quote others, within reason, without always having to ask permission. In order to balance the interests of copyright owners and users, it is widely accepted, for example, that the period of protection should be finite and that it should be permissible to quote passages in the course of criticism or review, so long as the dealing is \"fair\". </p> <p>Writers are usually pretty relaxed about reasonable use being made of their work (particularly when it is not for commercial purposes) so long as they are properly credited. At the other extreme, most people would agree that wholesale reproduction without permission is wrong. In between, it is not always easy to assess whether extensive quotation is legitimate. A sensible rough and ready test that judges probably apply, perhaps not in so many words, is to ask themselves whether the original author is being ripped off or not.</p> <p>JK Rowling has generally tolerated the many hundreds of books about Harry Potter that are available. She has said in court that she has no problem with the reasonable use of quotations and that she welcomes criticism and comment. So why did she see this book differently? My understanding is that virtually the entire Lexicon consists of material drawn from the Harry Potter books, with little clear indication as to which passages have been copied, as very few quotation marks have been used. Furthermore there is almost no original analysis or commentary (unlike other books about the Harry Potter series). </p> <p>I am no expert in US copyright law, but I have little doubt that in this country Mr Vander Ark's book similarly would not be considered \"fair dealing\". I believe that it is salutary for those who piggy-back on the work of others to be reminded of the importance of respecting copyright, which not only protects authors' interests, but also gives consumers confidence in the originality of a work and helps to keep back what Rowling referred to in court as an \"avalanche of dross\".<br> <br>Those who have questioned the sense of JK Rowling's action will probably not have been aware of the extent of the copying by Vander Ark and have certainly shown a lack of understanding of the sensibilities of authors. Litigation is distracting and wearing; for a time it is all-consuming. JK Rowling does not have the financial insecurity that deters most authors from going anywhere near a lawyer, but I guess that, in common with other authors, her top priority is to find time to write. She would not have decided to pursue Mr Vander Ark's publishers, sacrificing much writing time, without feeling very strongly that, rather than turning a blind eye, she ought to take steps that would demonstrate the importance of copyright. Most authors will be grateful to her.</p>",

After 20 years of planning and almost a decade of building, Cern, the European particle physics laboratory, is ready to put its shiny new particle collider through its paces. </p> <p>In an hour or two, Cern researchers will attempt to send a beam of protons around the Large Hadron Collider for the first time. If it works, it will pave the way for the first collisions in around a month's time. From then on, scientists will have 20 years or so to direct the machine's muscle at some of the most profound mysteries in science.</p> <p>Cern is buzzing with activity this morning. In the press room I can overhear more languages than I can count. The good thing about being here at Cern, where Tim Berners-Lee invented the internet, is that you can be fairly sure the video feeds from the control room and the wireless networking won't crash halfway through the day. At least I hope that's a safe bet.</p> <p>I was half expecting some protesters outside the gates this morning. Perhaps the odd placard pleading scientists to think again before throwing the big switch. But it seems that for all the bluster in the press, no-one is worried enough about the machine destroying the world to wave a banner or chain themselves to the gates.</p> <p>The press, incidentally, are confined to a building called The Globe, which seems to be made of MDF.</p> <p>Here's the way things are set to run today. We're expecting to kick-off around 8am UK time with live broadcasting from Cern's control room. That should give us some details of how they will send the proton beam around the machine. In the history of particle colliders, I'm not sure anyone has got a beam of particles to circulate on their first attempt.</p> <p>We're due a briefing around 9am UK time, which will be very brief indeed, perhaps only enough time to say whether the first try has or hasn't worked.</p> <p>Attempts will continue through the day. My money is on them attempting to send the beam anticlockwise first, though it makes no difference. If they get the beam to go one way, they'll try and send it round the other way too. If that works too, the machine will go through some fine tuning to make sure the beam runs down the centre of the ring, with collisions set for a month's time.</p> <p>There's a bit of a racket that's just started up. Sounds like someone's tearing the very fabric of the universe. More posts to come as events unfold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337468659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/LHC1.ARTICLE.jpg\" alt=\"Large Hadron Collider (LHC) tunnel at Cern\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Martial Trezzini/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martial Trezzini/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>08:46 BST</strong><br>Scientists at Cern, the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva, have begun their first attempt to send a beam of protons around the Large Hadron Collider, the largest, most complex machine in the world.</p> <p>The beam of protons has been injected at close to the speed of light, but there are blocks inside the machine that stop it periodically as it works its way around. Each time the beam stops, the engineers can use magnetic fields to make sure the beam is travelling down the centre of the ring. If it's off to one side, it could crash into the ring wall and stop.</p> <p>We've just seen the first flash of the beam in the machine. And it looks to be well in the centre of the pipe it circulates in. The beam has now made it around the first sector, which is an eighth of the ring</p> <p>Lots of applause from Cern's control room. The last time they opened a particle collider, in the 1980s, it took 12 hours to get a beam to circulate. This is moving fast so far. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337469868\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/lhc3.article.jpg\" alt=\"Large Hadron Collider (LHC) switch-on\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>09:04 BST</strong><br>It's a big day here at Cern, the European particle physics laboratory, on the outskirts of Geneva. They have begun switching on their Large Hadron Collider, the most powerful particle smasher in the world. </p> <p>The man at the controls is Lyn Evans. He's a charismatic guy, running the show in jeans, white trainers and a stripey short-sleeved shirt. Yesterday, when I met up with him, he was in shorts and a tee-shirt covered in equations. </p> <p>The beam is now more than half way around the Large Hadron Collider. Lyn said this morning that it might take two hours to get the beam around if everything went well. So far, all is going fantastically smoothly though.</p> <p>\"We are making very good progress. The beam is now half way round the LHC,\" said Evans. \"At this rate, let's hope that within an hour, we'll get the beam the whole way round the LHC.\"</p> <p>There are four giant detectors around the ring, where ultimately two opposing beams will be crashed into one another. So far, the beam has gone past two of these detectors. One of the detectors has already picked up emissions from the beam striking a block that was put in place to halt the beam.</p> <p><strong>09:23 BST</strong><br>The beam has now reached the last detector, the enormous one called ATLAS. They are one sector away from a complete circuit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337469867\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/lhc2.article.jpg\" alt=\"Large Hadron Collider (LHC) switch-on\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists applaud as the switch-on progresses without a hitch.

One lap down. Scientists have just pulled the last block from the 17-mile-long tunnel and seen the beam of protons appear at the last stage of the Large Hadron Collider. So protons have now circulated once around the machine. It has gone extremely well for the scientists here. </p> <p>They've done it in under an hour. A great first day for a machine that will take us into a new era of physics over the coming decades. </p> <p>That's the slowest beam you'll see going around the LHC, at around 20mph. When it's up to speed, a proton will make more than 11,000 laps in a second.</p> <p><strong>10:31 BST</strong><br>The morning has gone so well, the Cern team are going to attempt to send a beam around the machine in the opposite direction. That will be coming up in the next hour or so.</p> <p>Verena Kain, a physicist on the LHC, had a few words to say about this morning's success: \"I didn't believe it, I had to see it a second time. It's just going fantastically well. Everybody is just floating right now. It's a first step, but it's fantastic it works so well.</p> <p>\"If you're a person who's interested in the fundamental 'why', then at some point you have to ask the questions we're asking with the LHC. We've got to know these things.\"</p> <p><strong>13:03 BST</strong><br>We've just heard that there was a minor glitch with the cryogenics system of the machine this morning. </p> <p>Cooling is absolutely crucial to the LHC's operation, with the superconducting magnets running at around \u2013271C. It is these magnets that steer the beam around what at light speed is the incredibly tight curve of the LHC's ring. </p> <p>Engineers say the glitch was nothing major, and they hope to try and send the second beam around very soon.</p> <p><strong>13:48 BST</strong><br>Scientists have now started to send a second beam around the LHC, this time anticlockwise \u2013 in the opposite direction to the first beam. The beam is half way around right now.</p> <p><strong>16:05 BST</strong><br>The guys at <a href=\"http://public.web.cern.ch/public/\">Cern</a> have repeated this morning's success by sending a second beam of protons around the <a href=\"http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html\">LHC</a> in the opposite, anticlockwise direction. And like this morning, they completed the task in around an hour. The relief and delight on their faces is brilliant.</p> <p>I've just spoken to <a href=\"http://www.fusion.org.uk/cls/index.html\">Chris Llewellyn-Smith</a>, who was director general here at Cern when the LHC was given the go-ahead in the mid-1980s. He was tired but elated. \"It's fantastic. I've waiting so long for this,\" he said.</p> <p>Now the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/10/large.hadron.collider\">real work begins</a>. The beams are not yet circulating precisely enough. The physicists will need to tweak the magnets that surround the LHC's ring to make the beams, which are only a hair's width across, travel down the very centre of the pipe that contains them. If they can't do that, they won't be able to collide two beams head on.</p> <p>That could take a few days. For the moment, though, the place is full of tired, happy looking scientists. It's been a great day for them.</p> <p>If you want to read about the safety of the Large Hadron Collider, there's some <a href=\"http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/en/LHC/Safety-en.html\">good information here</a>.</p> <p>See our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/cern\">online guide to the Large Hadron Collider</a>, with articles by Stephen Hawking, Sir Martin Rees, AC Grayling and the comedian Chris Morris.</p>",
  "<p>In 2002 and 2003, the Bush administration knew something about the media that the media still don't fully understand about themselves. If you're in a position of power and you want to say something, just say it, no matter what, and the media will repeat it and repeat it.</p> <p>Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction to speak of? No matter. Just say he did. He wasn't six months away from nuclear capability? So what\u2014just assert that he was. He wasn't tied to 9-11, there was no famous Prague meeting? No problem. Suggest there might have been. Muddy it up. Good enough.</p> <p>Bush and co. knew that the media are constitutionally unequipped to call a lie a lie. People in the media like to flatter themselves as truth-tellers and the people's watchdogs and all that, but the fact is that except in very rare circumstances, there's no such thing as \"objective truth\" in the media, particularly the political media. There's just what one side says and what the other side says. This is especially so on cable television.</p> <p>The Bush people manipulated this. But the McCain campaign has taken it to extremes that make even Dick Cheney look like a wallflower. The number and intensity of outright lies, even for jaded observers, is just staggering.</p> <p>There's Sarah Palin's lies about the bridge and earmarks. There's an unbelievable one I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/09/johnmccain.usforeignpolicy\">mentioned yesterday</a> about Obama's alleged opposition to combat systems. There's the <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/a_new_stitch_in_a_bad_pattern.html\">flatly false assertion</a> to middle-class audiences that Obama will raise their taxes, even though his tax plan does no such thing. </p> <p>Now there's this incredible McCain education ad that tries to argue that Obama wants to pervert kindergartners. The legislation, in Illinois, was in fact designed to allow local school boards to teach \"age appropriate\" sex education \u2013 and to teach children about how to identify sexual predators! </p> <p>And then there's this silly pig-lipstick business, which I wouldn't even dignify by mentioning except that, obvious as it was that Obama was talking about McCain and not Palin, the McCain camp has now created something called the \"Palin Truth Squad\" that was formed to push the lie that Obama was talking about Palin. I'll say that again: a \"truth squad\" created for the express purpose of pushing a lie.</p> <p>And where is the truth squad of the press, the people's watchdogs? Mostly enjoying the show, hyping the \"mudslinging\" between the two sides, which of course \"both sides\" are guilty of. Nonsense. Obama and Biden distort certain things about McCain's record \u2013 that whole 100 years in Iraq business is a stretch. But McCain did say it, so it's only a stretch, not a fabrication.</p> <p>McCain and Palin are engaged in serial total fabrications. And almost no one calls them on it. The New York Times, which found the space to run a puffy piece on Palin's family on its front page the other day, hasn't found similar space to run a story under a headline like, \"McCain-Palin Claims Stretch Credulity, Some Say.\" </p> <p>CBS and CNN have finally gotten around to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/09/eveningnews/main4433129.shtml?source=mostpop_story\">running </a><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/09/palin.earmarks/\">reports </a>that pretty much state outright that Palin is lying about the bridge. ABC's Jake Tapper <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/a-piggish-debat.html\">plainly called out</a> the \"truth squad\" on the lipstick story. McClatchy did <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/margaret_talev/story/52169.html\">a strong fact-check</a> of the McCain education ad. But for the most part, the media treats it all as entertainment, a matter of which side has seized the offensive. </p> <p>The McCain team knows all this. So they consciously promote lies, knowing that no real mechanism exists to stop them from doing so. </p> <p>The Obama team should have been doing a stronger job of push-back these last few days. It was only after Obama himself said Palin was lying about the bridge that a few media outlets started pursuing that angle. That's how the game is played, and the McCain strategy will be a test of their ability to hit back fast and hard. </p> <p>But this race is now a test of the media too. You'd think after being told in the run-up to the Iraq war a bushel of things that didn't end up being true that they printed anyway, they'd have given some thought to the question of how not to let themselves be manipulated like that again. But it is happening again, and the media are getting played in exactly the same way.</p> <p>And what does all this say about John McCain? In 2000, when he was running against George Bush in the South Carolina primary, he was smeared by outright lies charging among other things that he'd fathered an out-of-wedlock black child. The man who \"directed communications\" for Bush's 2000 South Carolina effort was Tucker Eskew. McCain confidants have long held Eskew partly responsible for those smears. </p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/02/mccain-hires-gop-operativ_n_123152.html\">McCain hired him</a>, to staff up Palin. That just about says all we need to know about today's McCain. </p> <p>Now let me ask you. What is more revealing of a candidate's \"character\": The fact that a candidate used a phrase as old as the hills, a phrase the other candidate himself has used (see Jake Tapper above), or the fact that a candidate would hire someone he once regarded as having helped spread vile innuendo about him and his family?</p> <p>Deeper and deeper we go into the hall of mirrors\u2026</p>",
  "<h2>Today's shows</h2> <p><strong>Phillip Lim</strong> has only been showing his 3.1 label at New York for a few seasons, but it met with almost instant acclaim. This time last year he was so blas\u00e9 about the collection that he was sitting in the front row an hour before the show started. This season Anna Wintour was firmly ensconced in the front row - wearing sunglasses throughout, as you do in a tent with no natural light whatsoever. If only Roger Federer had appeared on the catwalk with the male models, it would surely have bought a girlish smile to her face. </p> <p>The clothes showcased Phillip Lim's immaculate tailoring, with the odd Spanish touch: matador vests, tango dresses and a black \"conquistador\" leather jacket amongst them. The entrance to the catwalk was vaguely Moorish but the show notes contained only a quote from Pedro Soler to explain the inspiration behind the collection:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>That very night, while removing his lavish costume, the bullfighter looked at his past and felt grateful for this suit that calls for a noble body and soul.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>So that clears that up then. Lovely art deco necklaces though. </p> <p>At <strong>Nanette Lepore's </strong>show the assistants all wore \"<a href=\"http://www.savethegarmentcenter.com/\">Save the Garment Center</a>\" T-shirts, and the programme issued the same appeal: \"If the Garment Center disappears, the future of young American designers will be in jeopardy and thousands of jobs will be lost\". The sombre mood didn't, however, infect the gorgeous clothes - this may be my favourite show so far. Dresses with floral prints were pretty but not twee, and the creamy-gold silk that appeared in dress and blouse form has shot straight to the top of my wishlist. </p> <h2>News and reviews</h2> <p>Marc Jacobs followed up the rave reviews of his mainline event with a more sedate affair at the <strong>Marc by Marc Jacobs</strong> show, complete with whitewashed walls and lots of non-iron fabrics. Celebrities were also conspicuous by their absence, apart from Kelly Osbourne - though she was so ever-present yesterday that I expected her to turn up when I opened my mail. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337481334\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/marcjumpa1.jpg\" alt=\"Model wearing jumpsiut at Marc by Marc Jacobs show\" width=\"140\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hide your eyes if you have hips.

Whatever we did to deserve the continuation of this hideous trend, I'm sure we are all very very sorry. The <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/runway/2008/09/09/marc-by-marc-jacobs-no-ironing-required/\">Wall Street Journal blog</a> quotes a Manhattan boutique owner saying she expects the jumpsuit to be a \"massive trend\": </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's just so easy - you just throw it on and you're done,\" ... She predicts that the versions that come with balloony harem-style pant bottoms, however, may be a hard sell. \"Those are difficult even for super-skinny women,\" she says. \"If you have any hip or thigh issue, you have to be careful.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is presumably \"hip and thigh issues\" as in, actually having hips and thighs.</p> <p>Skipping past the plastic action figure of Sarah Palin in the news pages (a photograph, sadly, rather than free gift with purchase) of the New York Daily News, their Fashion editor Amy Diluna was very keen on <strong>Matthew Williamson's show </strong>yesterday morning, though the fashion pack generally didn't seem to agree: the show was bizarrely empty considering the crushes that have been seen elsewhere this week. \"None of us might ever wear [the] bubblegum pink cigarette suit,\" she writes, \"And probably none of us should, as everyone else on the subway heading to work would be traumatised. But what fun.\"</p> <p>Forgetting for a moment the pretence that fashion week is about fashion (parties, darling, parties) the stylish place to be last night was <strong>Prada's screening</strong> of its <a href=\"http://www.sfilate.com/fashion/news.cfm?id=11777\">new animated short film</a>, \"Fallen Shadows\", to a packed and oh-so-well-dressed New York crowd. Celebrities included Jessica Alba, Claire Danes, Mena Suvari and Kanye West.</p> <p>The film is apparently \"romantic, tragic and elemental\" and features a soundtrack by Antony and the Johnsons, which will surely make it well worth a watch when it appears soon on <a href=\"http://www.prada.com/\">prada.com</a>.<br></p> <h2>Celebrity of the day</h2> <p>I mentioned yesterday that <strong>Betsey Johnson's</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2008/sep/10/newyorkfashionweek.catwalk?picture=337467798\">bizarre catwalk show </a>featured a male model doing a Johnny Depp impression.

  "<p>What a difference a year makes. As last autumn's conference season beckoned, Labour's prospects of securing a fourth term in power seemed good, if not certain; David Cameron appeared likely to be the fourth consecutive Tory leader not to make it to No 10.</p> <p>That, of course, is not quite how things worked out and, as the Guardian <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.labour\">suggests</a> this morning, one of the major reasons for that has been Labour's failure to develop a clear and coherent case against Cameron.</p> <p>Crewe and Nantwich showed that any attempt to run a class war campaign \u2013 focusing on the wealthy backgrounds of Cameron and his shadow cabinet \u2013 would be a disastrous mistake. And despite the Economist's <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11920727\">recent detection</a> of \"a mini-revival of social conservatism\", simply denying that the Conservative party has changed risks repeating the error of the Tories' spectacularly ineffectual \"New Labour, new danger\" attacks on Tony Blair. But with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/labour.conservatives\">reported references</a> to \"slick positioning\" hiding \"dangerous, old-fashioned Tory rightwing instincts\", this appears to be the line of attack that Labour has settled on.</p> <p>The more apposite charge, as James Purnell has <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/consultations/challenge/article.asp?a=47\">previously suggested</a>, is that Cameron's politics are akin to an electoral weathervane, pointing in whatever direction he believes the popular wind to be blowing. In the face of rising oil prices, for instance, the Tory leader's affinity for the green agenda has waned \u2013 a reflection no doubt of its diminishing utility to his rebranding of the Tory party. </p> <p>It would be wrong, though, as this month's <a href=\"http://www.progressives.org.uk/Magazine/index.asp\">Progress magazine</a> argues, for Labour to simply write Cameron off as a \"shallow salesman\". Instead, Labour should be putting the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.policy\">detailed policies</a> the Tory frontbench has announced \u2013 on health, education, and welfare \u2013 under far greater scrutiny. Do the Tories really want to put patients first, when they look rather keener to appease the BMA? Can the Conservatives really claim they will trust teachers more, while planning to bring back an intrusive and regressive inspection regime? And while the Tories are right that work is better than benefits, can this goal be achieved by the charity and voluntary sectors acting alone?</p> <p>Thus the more substantive indictment against Cameron is that though he may desire the ends, he cannot bring himself to will the means. His dogmatic aversion to government activism both undermines his case against Labour and his attempt to fashion a modern conservatism. The hyperbole of his \"broken society\" rhetoric is matched only by the paucity of the remedies he proposes: opaque references to \"self-regulation\", undefined promises to support the family, and vague calls for the third sector to do more (despite, in many cases, it lacking the capacity to do so). </p> <p>But if Labour is to successfully charge Cameron with being dogmatic about the state, it must adopt a far more pragmatic attitude itself. As the Progress' policy group on public service reform <a href=\" http://www.progressonline.org.uk/consultations/challenge/\">argued in July</a>, the party needs to shed the remnants of its statist past and go far further in redistributing power and control over our public services to both individual citizens and local communities. This will require a radical rethink about the role of the state, but it is the only way Labour might resurrect its fortunes over the ever-shortening time before the next election.</p>",
  "<p><br>More than commodities ... Damien Hirst in front of The Incredible Journey. Photograph: Felix Clay</p> <p>Words have been sent flying around at white hot speed this week with the launch of the Hirst Spin Accelerator, a machine designed to produce unprecedented amounts of verbiage about the condition of British modern art. Scientists hope to discover deep secrets about the art world when the experiment climaxes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/09/damienhirst.art\">Sotheby's auction rooms next Monday</a> - will the Hirst quantum be exposed as exhausted? Australian Hirstologist Robert Hughes even predicts that all contemporary art is about to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/07/damienhirst.art\">sucked into the market's black hole</a>.</p> <p>Intimidated by all this theory, I decided to see for myself exactly what Damien Hirst is selling in his auction at Sotheby's. His works are exhibited at the auction house in a series of capacious lounge-like galleries - butterfly and spin paintings fill the walls, and you negotiate your way among vitrines from the pitiable Golden Calf with its shiny yellow metal hooves visibly fixed to the gold bottom of its tank to a zebra that looks like a George Stubbs painting made flesh. </p> <p>There are too many sharks and the unicorns look a bit like ripoffs of Mark Wallinger, who Hirst once beat to the Turner Prize. But there is also the zebra, a truly strange and eerie curio. Damien Hirst makes too many Damien Hirsts - that is true - and this exhibition is an unruly ragbag of high and low points. He long ago suspended quality control. This means there are a lot of dodgy works in collections around the world - like his medicine cabinet Endgame that I saw unconvincingly displayed this summer as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/jul/23/mybriefmomentofculturalpa\">a highlight of Houston's Museum of Fine Art</a>. But, he's got this something. Vulgar, trite, hilarious, compassionate, monstrous and gargantuan - Hirst's idea of art is generous and voracious. There's an appetite for life in his work - even when that takes the form of an appetite for money. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2007/jun/05/wemustbuythediamond\">For The Love of God</a>, his diamond skull, remains the most haunting work by a young(ish) artist for ages. The zebra, the best thing at Sothebys, is equally weird and wonderful.</p> <p>Damien Hirst is more interesting than any other artist of his (my) generation. His flaws are part of his bizarre humanity, as an artist. Will that all vanish if this sale is a failure? Er, no. Do artists have the right to sell their own work? Er, yes. So it seems this is not the end of the art world, after all.</p>",
  "<p>The police practice of allowing firearms officers to compare their accounts of a shooting risks compromising any investigation into their actions, the high court was told today at a judicial inquiry into the death of a barrister. </p> <p>The family of Mark Saunders, who was shot dead in his Chelsea flat in a police siege in May, claims the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into his death was unlawful.</p> <p>Tim Owen QC, representing Saunders' sister Charlotte, questioned whether allowing firearms officers to confer \"before and during the recording of their accounts\" was compatible with human rights laws.</p> <p>\"The present practice means that there is a substantial risk of collusion and of contamination,\" he told the court.</p> <p>Owen argued that the risks in this case were \"substantial\" partly because the IPCC had interviewed the officers in groups. </p> <p>Ms Saunders and her family, who believe the barrister was posing no further risk when he was shot, are seeking a declaration from Mr Justice Underhill that there has been an unlawful failure to disclose sufficient information to her in the course of the investigation.</p> <p>Mark Saunders, 32, shot at police, neighbours and buildings with a legally owned shotgun from his \u00a32.2m Markham Square flat on May 6. Five hours later he was shot by police and died of multiple bullet wounds. </p> <p>His family has said he was shot when he was not posing a lethal threat to others.</p> <p>Saunders' sister argues that the IPCC practice of allowing police officers involved in a fatal shooting to confer with each other, consult documents, delay and then to write up their accounts is a breach of article 2 of the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>She says the IPCC has failed to prevent the officers' evidence from being contaminated.</p> <p>In a statement before today's hearing, she said: \"In these circumstances, how can we be assured that the officers' written statements are an accurate and uninfluenced account of their thought processes when they pulled the trigger?</p> <p>\"I do not understand why not one of the officers who shot Mark has been interviewed by the investigators, four months after his death. I feel this goes against any course of natural justice.</p> <p>\"Members of the general public are interrogated independently and immediately after even minor incidents. Why is it so different for the police, especially when the consequences of these actions are so devastating?</p> <p>\"How can I begin to grieve when I have so many unanswered answers and a dwindling faith in the integrity of the investigation?\"</p> <p>The IPCC practice of allowing officers to confer was agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p> <p>Speaking to the BBC, Ms Saunders said: \"I am not necessarily saying that they [the police officer involved] have chatted to each other and cooked up some story. But they are allowed an opportunity to discuss their thoughts with the other people.</p> <p>\"I do question whether they really had to kill my brother. I would have thought over the course of four and half hours something else could have been done instead of having to shoot him.</p> <p>The IPCC said it rejected the family's challenge. \"We are very confident that our investigation is robust and being carried out thoroughly and fairly,\" it said in a statement. \"It is fully independent of the Metropolitan police service.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"It's very easy for the Israeli public to believe that Palestinians are lying when it's just their word against the word of a soldier or settler\", explained <a href=\"http://www.btselem.org/English/\">B'Tselem's</a> spokesperson, Sarit Michaeli. The Israeli human rights group has brought <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7517406.stm\">several</a> high-profile <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7451691.stm\">cases</a> to the public's attention this summer, providing vital video evidence of the scale of the violence meted out by settlers and soldiers alike. In the process the footage has seriously dented efforts to smear Palestinians complaining of assault. According to Michaeli, \"[The video evidence] makes it much easier for us to demonstrate the reality on the ground, and to show Israelis what is being done in their names in the occupied territories.\"</p> <p>B'Tselem's <a href=\"http://www.btselem.org/english/Video/Shooting_Back_Index.asp \">Shooting back</a> campaign has also compelled the security forces in the West Bank to carry out more thorough investigations. Michaeli adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>It forces the police to do their duty: to investigate and bring to justice suspected attackers. However, a systemic change is still needed in the way the law is enforced in the occupied territories; at present the army are doing very well in terms of protecting settlers, but they are failing in their duty to protect Palestinians from attack.</p> </blockquote> <p>The status quo is hardly surprising, given the crystal clear evidence of collusion between the settlers and the army, and the recent admission by senior West Bank police officers that they prefer to \"<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011977.html\">turn a blind eye</a>\" to settler violence, rather than risk confrontations with fellow Israelis. On top of this, said Michaeli, there is the constant threat of retaliation against those wielding cameras on the Palestinian side.</p> <p>\"The Amira family [whose daughter filmed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/07/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">harrowing scenes</a> of a soldier shooting a blindfolded Palestinian man at point-blank range] <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1016196.html \">suffered reprisals</a>, partly as a result of the embarrassment caused to the Israeli security forces\", Michaeli noted. Salam Amira's father was recently arrested in the village of Nil'in by soldiers who reportedly boasted \"We caught Salam's dad\": when he asked his captors for water, their response, allegedly, was \"Eat your camera\". Michaeli also pointed to cases of settlers attacking Palestinians holding cameras, and of soldiers confiscating and destroying tapes. </p> <p>On a visit last week to the village of T'uba, lunch with our Palestinian hosts was disrupted by reports of a confrontation between one of the sons of the family and a jeepful of IDF soldiers. </p> <p>We hurried out into the roasting midday sun, squinting through the haze at the stand-off on the next hilltop. The soldiers were, apparently, unhappy that the boy was grazing his sheep in that particular spot, and the rest of the family watched anxiously to see what kind of punishment would be meted out. One of his brothers suddenly leaned down, rummaged around in a box, and \u2013 as though he were drawing a pistol from its holster \u2013 whipped out a video camera and aimed it in the direction of the troops. </p> <p>His weapon had been supplied by B'Tselem, and is this season's must-have accessory in the West Bank; the latest technology available to the Palestinians in their continuing fight for their human rights under the oppressive regime of Israeli occupation. However, while there is no doubt that the project has greatly empowered those taking part, there is also the worry that if it fails to bring about any serious change in the way they are treated, Palestinian participants will lose heart pretty quickly.</p> <p>The most obvious comparison to Shooting back is the infamous <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ROn_9302UHg\">Rodney King video</a>, which sent shockwaves through America, and proved conclusively that the black community's complaints of police racism and harassment were by no means a figment of their imagination. </p> <p>However, when an LA jury still found the footage insufficient evidence with which to convict the policemen involved, the upshot was some of the fiercest <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots\">race riots</a> seen in the US for decades. If a similar backlash is not to occur in the occupied territories, the army has to be seen to investigate properly every cast-iron case presented to them by way of B'Tselem's recordings. </p> <p>If a picture tells a thousand words, then a video tells 10 times that, when used to undeniably back up accusations of crimes carried out by settlers and soldiers, who would otherwise see themselves as above the law. I've witnessed the superiority complex of settlers on numerous occasions, even recording my own video of a settler teen threatening to kill me on one particularly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/17/thecrueltyofyouths\">charged trip</a> to Hebron. Thus B'Tselem's aim of restoring the rule of law in the wild West Bank is a noble aspiration, but not one that will be by any means easily achieved. </p> <p>However, despite the uphill struggle. B'Tselem have every reason to persist in their task. The reaction of the international media to both the Nil'in and Susya tapes was huge, and a massive shot in the arm to those behind its release. </p> <p>The more pressure that can be put on the Israeli authorities to hold its own troops and settlers accountable for their crimes, from both inside and outside Israel, the better for all the victims of the violence. The world is watching, and thanks to B'Tselem's efforts to bring the truth to their television screens, thousands more pairs of eyes are scrutinising the situation with every new tape released.</p>",

  "<p>Cambridge University today attacked \"meddling\" ministers for dumping universities with the problem of social mobility.</p> <p>Professor Alison Richard, Cambridge's vice-chancellor, told UK university heads that she is fed up with the government viewing universities as \"engines for promoting social justice\".</p> <p>Ministers have repeatedly demanded elite universities recruit more students from financially disadvantaged backgrounds to diversify their mix.</p> <p>But in her speech to the annual conference of Universities UK - the<br>umbrella group for vice-chancellors - at Cambridge University, Richard argued that this is not the chief aim of universities.</p> <p>\"We try to reach out to the best students, whatever their background,\" she said. \"One outcome of that is that we can help to promote social mobility. But promoting social mobility is not our core mission. Our core mission is to provide an outstanding education within a research setting.\"</p> <p>The government has pushed universities to collaborate more with business and industry in designing degree courses and exploiting the commercial benefits of their research.</p> <p>Richard told vice-chancellors that universities were not the \"handmaidens of industry\" or \"implementers of the skills agenda\".</p> <p>\"The risk is we are being asked to help fix industry's latest technological problems. We can't do that.\"</p> <p>Richard described universities as \"hopelessly under-funded\" and demanded more cash from government.</p> <p>\"There is a prevailing view in the UK that students, all students, are a source of income, not an investment in the future,\" she said.</p> <p>UK universities spend less per student than their chief rivals in the US, Australia and Germany, Richard said.

  "<p>\"Wind power could put another half million people into fuel poverty\" \u2013 shock, horror! That was how BBC Radio 4 promoted last week's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/theinvestigation/pip/3vlit/\">The Investigation</a> into the future of wind power in the UK. </p> <p>Who can blame them? It got me listening. But do their figures stack up? And what exactly was Sir David King, former government chief scientific advisor, up to when he uttered his dire warning? In case you missed it, here's that warning in full:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we overdo wind, we are going to put up the price of electricity and that will push more people into the fuel poverty trap. Numbers of half a million are not at all unrealistic ... this is an issue that does need to be revisited, and I say this as somebody who feels that we really have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions very substantially. But in my view it is an expensive and not a clever route forward to go for 35 to 40% from wind turbines.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Shocking stuff indeed. But back to basics: where does the 35% figure come from? In 2007, EU leaders agreed that 20% of all energy used in the EU should come from renewable sources, and the UK's own national target is 15%. It's hard to get much renewable energy into heating, transport, industry and other big energy uses, so most of the target must be met from green electricity. According to the programme, this means that, by 2020, the UK will have to get 40% of its electricity from renewables generally, and 35% from wind, specifically.</p> <p>The UK currently uses about 360bn units (kW/h) of electricity per year, and this is expected to rise to about 380bn units by 2020. So, if 35% comes from wind, that is 133bn units. Over a year, wind turbines typically produce 28% of their rated capacity, so a typical 1MW turbine generates about 2.45m units per year. It would, therefore, take about 55,000 1MW wind turbines to achieve our 35%. Given we already have 2,000MW of wind power, and it costs about \u00a31m to install a 1MW turbine, we would be looking at an investment of \u00a353bn.</p> <p>The government also <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/11/windpower.renewableenergy \">says it wants</a> 33,000MW of the new wind capacity to go offshore, where costs are higher, while improvements to the grid will be required to accommodate the new power sources, and interconnectors to Europe will need to be beefed up to handle supply fluctuations. Let's say all this doubles the cost to \u00a3100bn. Radio 4 quoted E.ON as estimating the cost of this scale of wind power programme at \u00a310bn per year until 2020 \u2013 so our figures roughly match up.</p> <p>But according to the programme, this would add \u00a3400 per year to the average family energy bill. This is scary, but is it true? Only if you make two completely false assumptions. First, that the entire cost is loaded onto domestic consumers, even though they only use 36% of the UK's electricity production. Second, that they pay the entire capital cost in their bills every year for 10 years. But this is not how large energy projects are financed. Just as most people buy their homes on a mortgage, which they pay off over 20 or more years, so power companies borrow the money, and pass on the cost of servicing their loans.</p> <p>Financing the whole \u00a3100bn at 6%, this would create a capital cost of \u00a36bn per year. Since domestic consumers use 36% of electricity supply, the domestic share would be \u00a32.2bn per year. Divided among 25m households, this would cost us \u00a388 per year per household. This figure does not include maintenance and running costs \u2013 but then these are small for wind turbines, since (unlike coal and gas power stations) they do not burn fuel.</p> <p>But remember that the power companies are preparing to invest billions in new fossil generation capacity, anyway. For example, E.ON is seeking approval for a new 1,600MW coal fired plant at Kingsnorth in Kent, at a cost of \u00a31bn, and similar projects are in the pipeline to replace old coal-fired plants and nuclear power stations approaching closure. With 53,000MW of new wind capacity, we won't need those investments in new coal-fired generation, and we will save money on the fuel that won't have to be burnt. Just how much will be saved depends on future fuel costs. But if fuel turns out to be expensive, wind will actually be the cheaper option.</p> <p>So The Investigation's figure that wind power will add \u00a3400 to the average's family's annual electricity bill is plain wrong. In fact, with the savings on coal, we can probably achieve 35% wind penetration in our electricity supply by 2020 for under \u00a350 per household per year, and in the high fuel cost scenario, it would add nothing at all. It will also yield security benefits by making the UK less dependent on politically sensitive Russian gas imports. And that's before even starting on the environmental cost of carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>As for fuel poverty, the National Housing Federation <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/default.aspx?tabid=254&amp;mid=828&amp;ctl=Details&amp;ArticleID=1391\">has estimated</a> that 5,700,000 households (about 13.7 million people) will be in fuel poverty by 2010 as typical household electricity and gas bills soar to \u00a31,400 a year. So King's estimate of an extra 500,000 people in fuel poverty as a result of wind power investments barely registers against this background increase. Moreover, King provided no indication as to where his figure actually came from. Was it guesswork? Maybe he could let us know.</p> <p>In any case, we know the cause of the fuel poverty surge: more expensive fossil fuels. So the precautionary approach is to make our energy costs less sensitive to future fuel price shocks, and diversify into renewables. To generate 35% of our electricity from wind would be an important step in this direction. The bulk of our electricity would still come from fossil fuels, mostly coal and gas, but the wind component (and additional contributions from other renewable energy technologies) would represent an important counterbalance.</p> <p>There is one repect in which The Investigation got it absolutely right, which was in lambasting the UK's mechanism for delivering our renewable electricity targets, the Renewables Obligation (RO). As the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/06/economy.energy\">revealed</a>, and I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/06/renewableenergy.greenbusiness\">wrote about</a> last week, the RO is both ineffective and very expensive, and has received widespread criticism. As Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, told Radio 4, the RO is \"probably the most expensive way of developing wind power\" and \"it would be hard to think of a worse policy.\" Yet the inside word is that the government is absolutely determined to stick with it, for essentially ideological reasons.</p> <p>This would be a serious mistake, with two undesirable consequences. First, whatever target is set within the RO, it is certain to be undershot. Second, it will create billions of pounds of extra cost for consumers above and beyond the actual cost of building and operating the plants themselves \u2013 part of which will be excess profit for wind power operators, and part of which will go as a \"windfall tax\" to the government itself. The RO should be scrapped and replaced with a feed-in tariff. Wind developers also face considerable cost and risk in getting their schemes through the planning process, which is reflected in consumer prices. Again, reform is badly needed. If King's doomladen prediction comes true, it will not be because of the price of wind, but rather thanks to the RO and the planning system \u2013 both of them manifestly unfit for purpose.</p> <p>So what was King up to? Here's my guess. He is a known supporter of nuclear power, and is widely credited for having overturned the anti-nuclear conclusion of the 2002 energy review, and for the government's current pro-nuclear stance first promulgated in its 2006 Energy Review. Perhaps his real problem with bringing 35% wind into our electricity supply is that it leaves little space for new nuclear power \u2013 that much wind would more than close the anticipated energy gap caused by the impending closure of our 23 nuclear stations over coming decades: their total contribution is just 80bn units a year, compared to the 133bn units we would be getting from wind.</p> <p>But for anyone worried about cost to both electricity consumers and taxpayers, nuclear power is the truly scary option. The cost of decommissioning our existing nuclear power stations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/23/nuclearpower.energy\">has already escalated</a> to \u00a383bn and seems certain to keep on climbing towards \u00a3100bn \u2013 roughly the cost of our whole wind power programme. If King's concern really is for the Britain's fuel-poor households, he must abandon his nuclear dream, and look instead to a clean, green future for the UK's electricity.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday 19 December 2008. The calculation of the potential cost to consumers of a large-scale wind power programme referred to the average family enegy bill, not electricity bill. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Lehman Brothers has rushed its trading statement forward by a week to today, amid growing fears that the investment bank will fail to raise much-needed capital to shore up its finances.</p> <p>Having seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/10/stockmarkets.lehmanbrothers\">its shares fall by 45% last night</a>, plunging Wall Street back into a state of high anxiety, the company was hit by a new blow today when the Korea Development Bank (KDB) said it had halted talks over taking a stake in Lehman.</p> <p>The breakdown of the talks with the state-owned South Korean bank is a blow to Lehman's options for raising fresh financing.</p> <p>The company will release its third-quarter results at 12.30pm BST (7.30am New York time), along with a disclosure of \"key strategic initiatives\".

  "<p>David Cameron has marched on to traditional Labour territory by declaring that the Conservatives are now Britain's \"true champions for progressive ideals\". Tackling poverty, protecting the environment and kickstarting social mobility would be key goals in his first years in office. A Conservative government would adopt a fresh approach as central government is cut back, giving charities and voluntary groups an important role in delivering Cameron's three priorities: school reform, welfare reform and strengthening families. \"This is not going to be about the usual mechanisms of government,\" one member of the Cameron circle says. \"It is a completely new approach that the political world has not got a handle on.\" The Guardian today explains the new Tory thinking in 10 policy areas. Richard Reeves, director of Demos, then assesses whether Cameron can deliver \"progressive goals through Conservative means\". Demos is an independent thinktank which influenced Tony Blair and provided many of the policy ideas for New Labour. Recently it has been working with the Tories on seminars on the \"post-bureaucratic age\", one of Cameron's big themes. Reeves says that the Conservative march into progressive territory \"is not merely rhetorical\". Some policies score well, such as education and the environment. But he says the Tories remain \"too sceptical about the progressive potential of the state\" and are backward-looking on marriage and law and order\". And his conclusion? Overall, \"they are making progress\"</p> <h2>1. Economy</h2> <p>The Conservatives plan an evolutionary rather than revolutionary economic policy, having ruled out promises of unfunded tax cuts which have got them into so much trouble at previous elections. Given that the public finances are so deep in the red, they would have little room to cut taxes at all.</p> <p>But their long-standing promise is to \"share the proceeds of growth\" - in other words, to let public spending grow more slowly than the economy over time, thereby allowing them to cut taxes or reduce borrowing over the medium term. They have pledged to match Labour's planned 2% annual spending growth until 2011; they say there will be no \"blank cheque\" after that.</p> <p>Spending levels would be ringfenced until 2011 in health, education and international development. Spending on other departments could change, though the overall spending envelope would remain the same.</p> <p>Tax cuts would have to be fiscally neutral, at least in the first years in government. Many of these would be paid from a \"family fund\" to be financed mainly by green taxes, though they admit that opposition to these taxes is growing.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing homes up to \u00a3250,000</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m a person, \u00a32m a couple</p> <p>\u00b7 Impose a \u00a325,000 levy on non-doms, generating \u00a32.8bn, to pay for stamp duty and IHT cuts</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>The short-term commitment to Labour spending plans is a break with the traditional tax-cutting agenda. And hitting non-doms was a long-overdue progressive goal. But on tax there is little to cheer: abolishing stamp duty helps those in the middle and the inheritance tax cuts is a boon for those at the top</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.economy\">Read more: economic policy</a></p> <h2>2. Welfare reform</h2> <p>The Conservatives are promising a \"full-bloodied version\" of what they call the government's \"half-hearted\" implementation of a radical report on welfare reform by the city financier David Freud. This calls for a greater role for the voluntary and private sector, who will be paid by results. They promise a two-pronged approach: tough new regulations from the centre coupled with a greater \"bottom-up\" approach for the voluntary and private sector.</p> <p>Tax credits, criticised by the Conservatives for masking rather than tackling the root causes of poverty, will be retained. But the Tories would aim to make them a less prominent tool in tackling poverty by improving people's skills as well, so they can secure better jobs and be less reliant on the state.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Tougher assessments for benefit claimants, notably the 2.6 million people claiming incapacity benefit as a result of illness or disability. All recipients of IB, excluding disabled people who cannot work, will undergo a \"work capability assessment\"</p> <p>\u00b7 People who refuse to join a return to work programme will lose the right to claim jobless benefits until they do</p> <p>\u00b7 The changes will be funded by a greater \"payment by results\" programme in which the voluntary and private sector will be paid when they succeed in returning people to work, and in keeping them there for two years</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>There is nothing progressive about leaving people in a state of long-term welfare dependency: independence is a key goal. Toughening up the conditions attached to benefits will be progressive if accompanied by measures to improve employability: bringing in non-state providers may help to achieve this so long as sufficient investment is made </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.welfare\">Read more: welfare policy</a></p> <h2>3. Family</h2> <p>Family breakdown lies at the heart of Britain's \"broken society\", according to David Cameron, who will recognise marriage and civil partnerships through the tax and benefit system.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, told the Guardian this week that marriage was the best environment in which to raise children.</p> <p>Cameron will also introduce measures to make Britain more \"family-friendly\". A key proposal is a health visitor for all mothers of newborn babies, to be paid from the budget for \"outreach workers\" in the Sure Start programme.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 End the \"couple penalty\" in the benefit system which means, according to the Tories, that people are encouraged to live apart</p> <p>\u00b7 All parents to be offered 12 months' parental leave, to be shared by mother and father</p> <p>\u00b7 Universal health visiting service to all mothers of newborn babies. This will include a minimum guarantee of two visits in the home for all mothers in the later stages of pregnancy, six hours of support in the first two weeks after birth, with a series of staggered visits leading to two visits a year for all one- to five-year-olds</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have set the pace on \"family friendly policies\" such as parental leave and are willing to invest in the critical early months after having children; more support for carers and fathers should be the next steps. But the tax break for marriage is a nostalgic irrelevance</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.family.policy\">Read more: family policy</a></p> <h2>4. Health</h2> <p>The Tories believe that Alan Milburn, Labour's most radical health secretary, will look on with envy as they introduce what they describe as a true NHS marketplace, free at the point of delivery and funded out of central taxation.</p> <p>Milburn wanted all NHS hospitals in England to have the opportunity to become independent foundation trusts by 2008, competing with each other for patients and free to borrow to fund investment. But just over half the NHS trusts remain under Whitehall control because they cannot yet pass a fitness test showing they are ready for independence. The Tories want an independent NHS board to direct the commissioning of healthcare, deciding what level of service can be afforded within the budget set by parliament. It would not run NHS hospitals or GP surgeries.</p> <p>A Conservative government would not set \"targets\", such as reduced waiting times. But it would demand certain \"outcomes\", such as an increased survival rate from cancer, which would be published.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong> </p> <p>\u00b7 Phasing out \"process-driven targets\", to measure \"outcomes\" instead</p> <p>\u00b7 Giving patients a choice of provider so they can use published information to decide what care they receive</p> <p>\u00b7 Introduce \"payment-by-results\" to reward hospitals and doctors that achieve high standards</p> <p>\u00b7 Rename health secretary as public health secretary</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Giving patients more power is a highly progressive goal. More competition should drive up standards. Greater autonomy for professionals may boost productivity. But without clear targets the danger of a \"postcode lottery\" will rise. The party's support for \"local\" GPs betrays their own conservatism on the institutional structure of healthcare</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.health\">Read more: health policy</a></p> <h2>5. Education/skills</h2> <p>A key ambition in public services - to pick up the \"baton of reform\" left by Tony Blair - applies strongly in education.</p> <p>Greater freedom would be granted to academies because the Conservatives believe the government has given local education authorities too great a say.</p> <p>A \"supply-side revolution\" to provide more than 220,000 new school places would have at its heart a Swedish-style system of not-for-profit \"free\" schools, run by charities, community groups and faith leaders working along the lines of academies. Working within the state sector, they would have access to equivalent levels of fund per pupil that is given to existing state schools.</p> <p>Spending would be increased on pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, with a premium added to the \"per pupil\" funding formula.</p> <p>The Tories would change the vocational training system to make it easier for employers to give apprenticeships, which would in turn be more responsive to the demands of the job market.</p> <p>They would redirect the current \u00a31.3bn skills budget, with \u00a3775m going directly on apprenticeships.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 New laws to improve headteachers' powers to curb poor behaviour by scrapping pupil appeal panels which assess pupils' complaints when they feel they have been unfairly excluded</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that every child that is capable of doing so is reading by the age of six</p> <p>\u00b7 Reform schools inspection regime to ensure \"more searching scrutiny of under-performance\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Lead a \"demand-led training revolution\" by abolishing the Learning and Skills Council and creating \"lifelong learning accounts\" to allow people to spend an allocation of money on training</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The \"academisation\" of British education is largely to be welcomed, and the Conservatives are in the lead. Extra resources targeted at the poorest pupils, greater autonomy for school leaders, and more choice for parents: all good news. What's missing is a distinct strategy on pre-school education</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.education\">Read more: education policy</a></p> <h2>6. Law and order</h2> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, will adopt a tough and tender approach. As an advocate of civil liberties, Grieve would need persuading as home secretary to abandon his campaign against the pre-charge detention of terror suspects for up to 42 days. ID cards would also be abolished.</p> <p>In other areas, he would adopt a tough stance. Grieve would amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that police no longer need to secure authorisation to conduct surveillance on those suspected of non-terrorist offences.</p> <p>The Tories would accept the government's points-based system on immigration. But they would toughen it by imposing an annual limit on immigration from outside the EU.</p> <p>Prisons would provide a testbed for some of the Tories' most radical \"bottom- up\" ideas. Private companies and voluntary groups would be hired - on a \"payment by results\" basis - to steer inmates away from a life of crime in an attempt to cut re-offending rates, which account for a high proportion of crime.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Border police force to \"secure Britain's borders\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Directly elected police commissioners to replace police authorities</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase prison capacity by 5,000 over Labour's plans</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace automatic release for prisoners with earned release</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Abandoning the 42 day pre-charge detention and scrapping ID cards may win over the hearts of Islington liberals: but in terms of overall policy the Tories need to focus less on policing and prisons and more on the \"causes of crime\". They claim to be anti-state, but rely on it much too heavily here</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.justice\">Read more: law and order policy</a></p> <h2>7. Environment</h2> <p>The battle against climate change was one of Cameron's early themes when he sought to \"decontaminate\" the Conservative brand. In recent months he has faced criticism for downgrading the environment.</p> <p>Cameron sought to restore the balance in June when he said the world could not afford to abandon the environment, even in an economic downturn. A Tory government would adopt \"realistic environmentalism\" that would have four core elements: green taxes to encourage good behaviour; stringent rules to encourage greener cars; a framework to encourage greener energy; and \"nudge\" ideas, such as listing how much energy people use on their fuel bills, to encourage energy efficiency.</p> <p>Tories say they will take a major step later this year when they launch what is being dubbed as the \"first coherent UK strategy for transforming Britain into a low carbon economy\". This is expected to offer stronger support for nuclear power.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Average emissions for new cars down to 100 grams per km by 2030</p> <p>\u00b7 Green taxes, which would not apply retrospectively, would go into a \"family fund\" to finance tax relief for families</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace climate change levy, a tax on energy, with carbon levy to distinguish between high and low carbon production</p> <p>\u00b7 Use money from EU emissions trading scheme to fund at least three carbon capture and storage demonstration projects</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that carbon emissions rate generated in new power stations cannot be higher than amount generated in modern gas-fired power stations</p> <p>\u00b7 Creation of \"feed-in tariffs\" with people paid for energy produced from, for example, solar panels</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have gone green, ticking boxes on micro-generation, carbon pricing, emissions standards and - maybe - the third Heathrow runway. Ring-fencing proceeds from green taxes for families is smart. But they have not paid enough attention to the impact of expensive carbon on poorer families - and look to be leaning too heavily on nuclear power</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.green.politics\">Read more: environment policy</a></p> <h2>8. Transport</h2> <p>Cameron says that gridlocked roads and slow, packed trains are neither good for business nor the environment. He would launch a feasibility study to introduce an expanded high speed train network, would tackle the worst bottlenecks and look at ways of giving parents an alternative to the school run to reduce congestion.</p> <p>The City of London has been worried that Cameron has tilted too far in favour of the environment. There was alarm in June when he appeared to rule out a third runway at Heathrow on the grounds that the government should try and make the airport \"better, not bigger\".</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Give \u00a3200m a year from the transport innovation fund to local authorities to encourage alternatives to car use</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>1/5</p> <p>Good rhetoric - non-existent policies. Another feasibility study on high-speed rail? There are countless initiatives already in place to discourage the school run. In transport you have to put your money where your mouth is: and the Conservatives have failed to make a single significant commitment likely to improve our transport infrastructure</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.transport\">Read more: transport policy</a></p> <h2>9. Local govt/housing</h2> <p>The Conservatives' new \"bottom-up\" approach will be tested in local government and housing as the party pledges a genuine devolution.</p> <p>Local government financing could be taken out of the hands of ministers who currently control the funding of 80% of council services. The overall level of funding would be decided centrally but the distribution would be set independently.</p> <p>The Tories say the government is setting unrealistic house building targets - 3m new homes by 2020. Instead of issuing central targets they will encourage local communities to accept new homes by introducing incentives.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Allow local authorities to retain a portion of local business rates</p> <p>\u00b7 Dismantle the \"bureaucratic quangocracy\" of regional assemblies and regional development agencies</p> <p>\u00b7 Remove council tax capping and instead hold local referendums to approve increases in council taxes \"more than the norm\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Encourage housebuilding by allowing local councils to keep the proceeds from council taxes paid by residents in newly built homes</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrap home information packs (Hips)</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Referendums in place of council tax capping is a bold democratic move, but will also test the strength of local polities. \"Bureaucratic quangocracies\" make for good political targets, but it is not clear what the Conservatives would do to support economic development in disadvantaged areas</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.local.government\">Read more: local government and housing policy</a></p> <h2>10. Foreign affairs</h2> <p>The Conservative approach to foreign affairs embodies the old and the new.</p> <p>On the new side, Cameron has pledged to meet the UN target on aid spending.</p> <p>On the old side, Cameron would be Britain's most Eurosceptic prime minister. His plan to reverse Britain's ratification of the Lisbon treaty, if the measure has not entered EU law by the time of a British general election, would be opposed by virtually every EU leader.</p> <p>Cameron would have an easier ride with the transatlantic special relationship. He enjoys warm relations with John McCain and had a friendly meeting with Barack Obama in July.</p> <p>Describing himself as a liberal Conservative in a speech in Islamabad last week, Cameron sought to reshape Tony Blair's \"liberal interventionism\" when he said he was sceptical about \"grand utopian schemes to re-make the world according to a politician's timetable\". His visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan was designed to underline a key theme: that there is no longer a separation between foreign and domestic affairs. They come together under the heading of \"national security\", because what happens in Pakistan now has a direct bearing on Britain.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Meet UN target on aid spending - 0.7% of GNI - by 2013</p> <p>\u00b7 Create a national security council, to be headed by Lady Neville-Jones</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>Europe remains the Conservatives' achilles heel in foreign affairs. Until Cameron gets Europe right his efforts to sketch a 21st century foreign policy will fail. But the Conservatives have developed a thoughtful approach to international development, especially on issues such as corruption and governance, aid effectiveness, and fragile states</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.foreign.policy\">Read more: foreign policy</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>11.20am</strong> We have cricket at Taunton, and good-quality cricket too, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. It doesn't get much better than Steve Harmison running in to bowl to Marcus Trescothick. Somerset vs Durham has the feel of a championship decider, but there are fears that it won't come up to scratch. Somerset, four points behind the leaders, Notts, with a game in hand, may tactically settle for the draw points, even though Durham are the other county with three games left.</p> <p>The first day has already been lost to rain so a benign pitch would probably kill the contest. Trescothick said the last one was \"like batting at Karachi\". We could do with this one behaving like Headingley. Durham have dropped Liam Plunkett, Andrew Caddick is missing for Somerset. And Justin Langer has just had a life - badly dropped on 27 by the wicketkeeper, Phil Mustard, off Callum Thorpe.</p> <p>I had a long chat to Trescothick yesterday, in the week of the publication of his autobiography. He exudes contentment. His stress-related depressive illness might mean that his England career is over, but he talks of playing for Somerset until he is 40. He can still provide a lot of pleasure in the years ahead.</p> <p><strong>11.40am</strong> Trescothick dismissed by Harmison for 18, caught by Callum Thorp. Langer also out, bowled Thorp for 31. Somerset 55-2.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> The notion that a not-quite-match-fit Shoaib Akhtar was going to be Surrey's saviour in their increasingly forlorn battle against relegation was always far-fetched, and four largely innocuous overs first things this morning will not have encouraged hopes of survival, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at The Oval</em>. Shoaib did whistle his second delivery past Chris Benham's outside edge, but after 24 deliveries that flatteringly cost him just seven runs, he was replaced by Alex Tudor and sent to shiver in his sweater at mid-on.</p> <p>Predictably enough, the two Hampshire wickets to fall went to the Bloke At The Other End, who in this instance was Jade Dernbach. Benham went first, shouldering arms in Dernbach's first over \u2013 the second of the morning \u2013 after almost falling in identical fashion the ball before. That made it 117 for three and four overs later it was 125 for four when Dernbach persuaded Sean Ervine to drag an attempted off-side force on to his stumps.</p> <p>But Michael Lumb knuckled down, occasionally breaking free to clip Tudor off his toes and cut James Benning behind backward point, and by the interval Hampshire \u2013 who themselves are glancing nervously over their shoulders at the relegation zone \u2013 had reached 208 for four, with Lumb on 69 and the ever-reliable Nic Pothas 38. Surrey will be hoping Shoaib has a light lunch.</p> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> One other county cricket story catches the attention today, <em>writes David Hopps at Taunton</em>. It seems that Darren Gough might not be retiring after all. He has received offers from Yorkshire and other counties to play Twenty20 next season and has told Yorkshire that he will consider their offer when he sees how he \"survives the winter\". That's the sort of thing elderly people say when asked if they are going on holiday next summer. \"My body might be 100 per cent then or it might be in bits,\" Gough said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at Taunton, Somerset are rebuilding cautiously after the loss of Justin Langer and Marcus Trescothick. Trescothick's departure was disappointing. Having just cleared fine leg when top-edging Steve Harmison, he clumsily edged the next one into third slip's hands. Somerset are 87-2 at lunch.</p> <p><strong>12.45pm</strong> After much suspicious prodding and poking, mainly by Pasty Harris, play finally began at 11.30am at Wantage Road, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. The session lasted an hour, at the end of which Northants are 48-0. Niall O'Brien is 33 not out, Stephen Peters a laborious 6. Peters was dropped by John Maunders in the first over - he flashed hard at David Masters, and Maunders, only registered by Essex to play first team on Monday, couldn't hang on. </p> <p>Pitch looks good, so given the forecast, it's almost certainly a competition for bonus points. The ice-cream van has arrived, somewhat optimistically, and one of our number is wondering how many cider lollies you would have to consume to feel any effects.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> The new Swalec Stadium doesn't look much brighter today than when I was here for the ODI between England and South Africa a week ago, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. And that was a wash-out.</p> <p>There has been a lot of rain here in the past month and the start of the championship match between Glamorgan and Worcestershire has been delayed. They had a look this morning and they will be looking again at 2pm with a view to starting at about 3pm or 3.30pm.<br> Worcestershire need the points to clinch the second division title. Today they plan to unveil new signing Dilhara Fernando, the Sri Lanka fast bowler who has appeared in 30 Tests. Fernando, who will appear as an overseas player, has been brought in to plug the gap left by the injured Kabir Ali, who has a back stress fracture. But there will be no final away appearance for the retiring Graeme Hick, who is out again with his injured right elbow. Worcestershire are hoping that Hick will be fit enough to make his final appearance for the county against Middlesex at Kidderminster next week.</p> <p>Even if he's not fully fit Hick will probably play, even though he's struggling to bat or throw the ball. It's a pity it's not Worcester, though, scene of so many of his triumphs, for his sake and those of his many supporters.</p> <p><strong>2.41pm</strong> Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose, confided at lunchtime that 300 would be a good first-innings score on this Taunton pitch, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. The benign surface we had feared has not materialised and although this is a surface of little pace. there is some encouragement for all the bowlers.</p> <p>Somerset have lost James Hildreth and Wesley Durston since lunch. Last week I erroneously referred to Mr Durston as Wesley Dursley, and seem to have mixed him up with a combination of three Harry Potter characters: Vernon Dursley, Dudley Dursley and Percy Wesley. Dudley Dursley, Harry's cousin, is the leader of a gang of thugs, which is a bit unfair on both Durston, who Somerset aficianados praise as an affable bloke, and Somerset, who are not at all thuggish. The Dursleys are all Muggles and hate anything to do with magic; Durston wasn't very happy with a spot of sorcery from Paul Wiseman, who turned one to bowl him for 19.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yorkshire's prospects of escaping the drop to Division Two have been undermined by the EU, which has ruled that acres are no more and now must be referred to as hectares. The county proudly referred to as The Broad Acres might be expected to avoid relegation. A county about to be renamed as The Broad Hectares is clearly going down.</p> <p><strong>2.50pm</strong> Shoaib Akhtar must have a clause in his Surrey contract limiting him to four-over spells only, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at The Oval</em>. After conceding seven runs in the first of them at the start of the day, he returned for another burst after lunch with the second new ball, only to leak 21 runs and receive a talking-to from Neil Mallender for sending down a beamer to Nic Pothas. In truth it was little more than a slower ball gone wrong, but Shoaib's discussion with Mallender, who consulted with his colleague Nigel Llong at square-leg, verged on the heated. </p> <p>Out came the teapot pose that has so exasperated Pakistan captains over the years and there was a dismissive gesture with the right hand as Shoaib finally turned back to his mark for the next delivery. At the end of the over he trudged down to fine-leg, chucked his sweater over the boundary and sought sympathy from his compatriot Saqlain Mushtaq, who was off the field at the time. Even when he is not taking wickets, Shoaib is box-office.</p> <p>And so \u2013 typical Shoaib \u2013 he decided to cling on to a top-class catch instead. With half an hour to go before tea and Surrey desperate for a breakthrough, Liam Dawson failed to control a pull off Alex Tudor and was superbly held at fine-leg by a tumbling Shoaib. That left Hampshire on 286 for six, having earlier lost Michael Lumb for 72 in controversial circumstances. Pushing forward to Saqlain, he edged low to slip where Scott Newman claimed the catch. Lumb stayed his ground, only for the umpires to send him on his way. The Surrey fielders did the same and Lumb fumed all the way to the pavilion. Hampshire could now do with Pothas reaching three figures. He currently has 73.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> Unusual dismissals of the season no 61: Zander de Bruyn, run out by two yards by Ben Harmison at fine leg, attempting a third-leg bye, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. Particularly senseless, says David Hopps at Taunton, as De Bruyn's 75 had held Somerset together. Somerset 198-6 at tea. Durham hold a slight advantage.</p> <p><strong>3.50pm</strong> After an uneventful hour's play this morning, the afternoon session has fairly motored along, <em>reports Richard Rae at Northampton</em>. From 48-0, Northants have progressed to 255-6 at tea. Niall O'Brien was bowled behind his legs for 45, sweeping at James Middlebrook, Rob White threw the bat at a wide delivery from Ravi Bopara and was caught by Ryan ten Doeschate on the cover boundary for 24, Peters was yorked by Bopara for 41, Wessells was leg before to Napier for 17, Klusener edged his first delivery off Napier low to Pettini at first slip - a lazy waft - and Boje, on 37, has just top edged an attempted pull at Bopara hit to Pettini at mid-on. David Sales is not out 56. </p> <p>With the exception of Peters, and obviously Klusener, all the batsmen have scored quickly, particularly Sales, whose 50 came off 47 balls, and Nicky Boje. Sales hit his first ball for four, stroked through cover, and his next scoring shot was an apparently effortless straight six off Bopara. But then he so often does time the ball beautifully, and even allowing for the fact he's playing at Northampton, surely he'd have played for England if he'd taken his fitness seriously.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm</strong> No cricket at the Swalec Stadium today, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. The trouble centred on the run-up at the Cathedral Road end of the ground. It is sodden and has refused to dry out all day. </p> <p>No one could accuse umpires Barry Duddlestone and Stephen Garrett of not doing their best to get play under way. There were five inspections but after the last of them, at 4pm, it was decided that there would be no play. And with more rain forecast overnight, tomorrow is already in some doubt.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/georgebush.iraq\">Iraq troop withdrawals</a> President Bush <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/georgebush.usforeignpolicy\">announced</a> on Tuesday at the National Defence University were much ado about nothing. The slight reduction in troop levels will keep US troop levels several thousand above what they were in January 2007 when he announced the \"surge\" of US troops. Bush administration critics will say the troop withdrawals are too little and too late, while supporters will echo Bush's \"return on success\" talking point.</p> <p>But this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/georgebush.iraq\">debate on troop levels</a> - almost certain to dominate whatever paltry coverage the Iraq war gets in the media these days - misses a more fundamental point: that the surge has failed to achieve its central objective of advancing Iraq's political transition and encouraging power-sharing deals among Iraq's competing factions. </p> <p>The greatest myth promoted by Bush in his speech was found in this line: \"Political reconciliation is moving forward, and the Iraqi government has passed several major pieces of legislation.\" By overstating the meagre steps taken by Iraq's leaders in barely passing a few relatively insignificant laws in their parliament, Bush's statement ranks right up there with his 2003 \"mission accomplished\" speech and vice-president Dick Cheney's assertion that the insurgency was in its <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/30/cheney.iraq/\">\"last throes\"</a> in 2005.</p> <p>A more honest look at the balance sheet on Iraq's political transition yields an inconvenient conclusion: The surge has frozen into place the accelerated fragmentation that Iraq underwent in 2006 and 2007 and has created disincentives to bridge central divisions between Iraqi factions. Moreover, rather than advancing Iraq's political transition and facilitating power-sharing deals among Iraq's factions, the surge has produced an oil revenue-fuelled, Shia-dominated national government with close ties to Iran. This national government shows few signs of seeking to compromise and share meaningful power with other frustrated political factions.</p> <p>When Bush announced the surge in January 2007, its stated objective was to improve security in order to provide the space for meaningful political reconciliation. The underlying theory was that violence impeded Iraq's political transition and national reconciliation. But Iraq's brutal violence is better understood as politics by other means rather than as an alternative to politics. Key factions in Iraq used violence to reshape Iraq's internal balance of power and altered the demographic composition of important areas of Iraq like Baghdad. </p> <p>One of the failures of the 2007-2008 surge of US military forces is that the declines in violence from record levels that it accomplished did not fundamentally alter the strategic calculations of Iraq's leading factions in ways that advance political accommodation and progress toward power-sharing deals. The threats posed by terrorist groups such as al-Qaida in Iraq are much diminished, and militias such as the Mahdi army, though not defeated by any means, operate less freely. These reductions in violence are important, but they have not translated into meaningful progress in Iraq's political transition.</p> <p>When it comes to true power-sharing - who has control of the guns, money and other key state resources like oil - Iraq has not moved forward substantially. On the state's monopoly on the use of force, Iraq has taken some steps forward like increasing the size of the Iraqi army. But it has also taken some steps backwards. Instead of disbanding key militias, the surge actually created new set of Sunni militias, further undermining the efforts to build a unified central government by supporting independent centres of power. The independent Kurdish Peshmerga military force not only remains in place, but has also become involved in some standoffs with the Iraqi army in disputed territories in places like the Diyala province this summer. Shia militias like Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army and the Badr organisation have either gone underground or infiltrated parts of the growing Iraqi security forces.</p> <p>On power-sharing of Iraq's considerable oil wealth, no significant advances have been made since the government was formed in 2006. Constitutional reforms promised as part of a deal to get the Sunni factions to join the political process in 2005 have not been delivered, and a deal on dividing Iraq's oil resources has remained elusive. Even getting to a deal on deciding the rules of the road for a new set of provincial elections proved to difficult for Iraq's divided leadership to complete.</p> <p>With the surge forces departing and US forces declining, Iraq is a less violent place, but it remains a fragmented country. On the most important questions connected to resolving Iraq's internal conflicts, Iraq has not moved forward. The core question remains the same for Iraq's leaders: how to share power among the diverse ethnic and sectarian groups. By overstating the gains to date on Iraq's political transition, Bush continues to understate the considerable challenges that lie ahead.</p> <p>Iraq's leaders must address their divisions on their own terms, and at their own pace. The US cannot impose a military solution to the power-sharing disputes among Iraq's leaders, and expending significant resources in an effort to do so is unwise while other pressing national security challenges loom in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. True progress in Iraq requires the US to acknowledge the increasing moves by Iraqis to assert sovereignty and control over their own affairs.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>It's not quite mission impossible for Wales this afternoon. </p> <p>Just mission very difficult. Or mission God help them if they lose an early goal in front of that lot. For this game John Toshack is without Craig Bellamy, Freddy Eastwood, Jason Koumas, Danny Gabbidon, Lewin Nyatanga and James Collins. </p> <p>So, just his first choice attack and central defence, plus his best midfielder. On top of which Paul Parry has decided it's time to move on and let other, hungrier disinterested fringe payers sit on the bench. </p> <p>On the plus side, Sam rickets and Gareth Bale are feeling better. </p> <p>Wales need them, too. Beating Azerbaijan on Saturday was vital given that this was their next stop-off, a game that is, along with away to Germany the toughest game in the group. </p> <p>The most intimidating too. Russia's fans are incredibly loud. They wave enormous heraldic flags at you. And these days they've also got a side worth shouting. Russia reached the semis at Euro 2008 and this is a team with genuine star quality in Andrei Arshavin and Roman Pavlyuchenko, the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeez and the left-back Yuri Zhirkov. </p> <p>Still, Guus Hiddink has admitted Russia re under a lot of pressure to win at home. And they say Pavlyuchenko might have a dicky ankle. </p> <p>So you never know. Wales keep it tight for 20 minutes. Crowd gets on the home team's back. Russia get frustrated. Wales get some set pieces going. Aliens land and abduct Arshavin. A giant lizard attacks Moscow, accidentally diverting the ball into the Russian goal with its outstretched talon. <br>You just never know. </p> <p>Toshack would be overjoyed with a draw. And happy with respectable defeat in a group where Wales still have plenty to fight for when they get their stars back. Oh, all right, when they get Craig Bellamy and Freddy Eastwood back. </p> <p>An early contribution from Richard Watkins: </p> <p>\"As a Wales fan, I've been doing a bit of background reading. 'At 17,075,400 square kilometers, Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than an eighth of the earth's land area. It has a population of 142 million people', says a popular internet encyclopedia. 'The population of Wales in the 2001 Census was 2,903,085, which has risen to 2,958,876 according to 2005 estimates. This would make Wales the 136th largest country by population if it were a sovereign state.' Which it isn't. 'The national sport of Wales is rugby union'.<br>This isn't fair, is it?\"</p> <p>So by population stats anything less than a 47-0 defeat is a triumph.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>It's all about positive thinking.</p> <p>On this theme Gary Naylor points out: \"everyone knows, \"an area the size of Wales\" is the international unit of environmental degradation, so can anyone tell me if Russia is still losing that area of forest every twenty minutes or whatever? Perhaps Dean Saunders knows.\"</p> <p>\"An area the size of Wales\". It's never used to describe a good thing. Always disasters. </p> <p>Why is that?</p> <p>Here are the teams:</p> <p>Russia: Akinfeev, Aniukov, Kolodin, Ignashevich, Zhirkov, Zyryanov, Torbinsky, Semshov, Semak, Arshavin, Pavlyuchenko.<br>Subs: Malafeev, Vasili Berezutsky, Alexei Berezutsky, Saenko,<br>Yanbaev, Pogrebniak, Bystrov.</p> <p>Wales: Hennessey, Gunter, Morgan, Ashley Williams, Bale,<br>Davies, Fletcher, Robinson, Edwards, Ledley, Vokes. <br>Subs:Myhill, Steve Evans, Ched Evans, Stock, Ricketts, Cotterill,<br>Earnshaw.</p> <p>Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>So Pavlyuchenko plays, as does Bale.</p> <p>John Hartson is in the studio chair for Setanta.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>He's actually quite good. Despite the fact he looks like a giant pink bloated watermelon with eyes and a mouth painted on it.</p> <p>He thinks Wales have nothing to lose and will \"go for it\". Maybe he's right. I'm cheered by his breezy confidence anyway.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Wales look like they're playing Fletcher and Robinson as a pair of holding midfielders.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>You can see why, but not exactly \"going for it\".</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>Vokes is on his own up front.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> And Russia kick us off, wearing the red kit today. Wales are in a spare Norwich home kit, which is very kind of the Canaries.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 mins: </strong>Apologies for a few technical problems here. Do stay with me. I'm typing this with a screwdriver under my arm.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 mins: </strong>Early possession for Russia but Wales look quite compact. Nice tackle by Davies in midfield snuffs out a swift break. It's noisy out there.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Promising break down the left by Zhirkov, but his cross is easily gathered by Hennessey. Nicely shepherded by Gunter.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9 mins:</strong> Russia having a right go at Gunter on the left flank. Both Zhirkov and Zyryanov trying to get inside him. Is this a Hiddink master-plan? Not an obvious weakness you'd have thought.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> Kolodin plays a long pass forward. Arshavin feeds Pavlyuchenko, whose shot is deflected narrowly over. That was a decent chance. Much too easy for Russia there. Got to hustle against this midfield. If they get the ball to Arshavin in space, well... It's not ideal.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 mins:</strong> It's looking a little bit like attack versus defence I'm afraid. Russia re the ones attacking.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>14 mins: </strong>Brilliant save by Hennessey. That had goal scrawled all over it. Arshavin feeds the Russian right-winger with an absolute peach of a pass. The deep cross is volleyed on target by Pavlyuchenko and the Welsh keeper makes a brilliant stop, palming it away. Ominous though.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 mins:</strong> Aniukov (for it is he on the right) again gets in behind Bale, who is exposed by his midfield. Ball scrambled away.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>16 mins: </strong>PENALTY FOR WALES!!! Bale tripped by Semak. Dead cert of a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>17 mins: </strong>PENALTY MISSED!! Bale strides up, all casual like, and hits it side-fotted, not that hard to Akinfeev's right. It's a good save, but he gave him a chance. That is a heart-breaker. Another Welsh penalty missed. And this isn't Azerbaijan.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Russia look a little more cautious now. But Wales must be absolutely distraught. That was a lovely break downfield by Bale and a definite penalty. Ah, me.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>22 mins: </strong>PENALTY FOR RUSSIA!! Zyryanov tripped by Robinson inside the box. All came from Hennessey's poor decision to chase a ball that was going out when he should have left it.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>22 mins: </strong>RUSSIA SCORE!! Pavlyuchenko takes one of those nifty little dinked kicks, the cheeky sod, and it's just past the keeper's right hand.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>26 mins:</strong> Russia still moving forward. Zhirkov sets up Zyryanov, whose powerful shot is palmed away by Hennessey. Those two Z's are giving Gunter a right old going over at right back .</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 mins: </strong> Arshavin is absolutely toying with the Welsh midfield. they are his playthings. A lovely chipped diagonal ball finds Pavlyuchenko in space. He should have scored. Scuffs it wide. Russia look great right now. The midfield are so fluid, switching positions, the little maestro on the ball all the time. Worrying.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>31 mins</strong> Nice little move by Wales on the left. Ledley plays a crafty ball in, but Akinfeev is out quickly to claim it. He's a real top keeper. Very young too. Vokes tries to get himself booked/slapped upside the head by getting in his way as he tries to chuck it out. But more hopeful for the men in yellow and light green.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>33 mins:</strong> Quick counter-attack by Russia ends with Zhirkov hoofing it over. Wales get back down the other end and win a free-kick. Bale loads it in the box, but it drifts out. </p> <p>Re: an area the size of Wales, Ian Copestake points out: \"Wales has unwittingly become a victim of semantic wars waging for 20 years between environmental activists and right-wingers. While conceding that the rainforests have indeed shrunk in size every year, the anti-environmental lobby insist that it has only ever been an area the size of a whale. I thank you.\"</p> <p>No, thank you.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>35 mins:</strong> Wales win their first corner. Bale takes it and Akinfeev comes to punch in that vaguely unconvincing \"continental\" style that somehow always just about works despite looking iffy. </p> <p>Better from Wales. Some attacks at least. </p> <p>It is absolutely tipping it down out there by the way.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>37 mins: </strong> This time Arshavin gives the ball away as Russia break quickly. Wales have shown they can get at russia. It;s just what's happening at the other end whenever the home team attack that's a bit worrying. </p> <p>Tim Bradshaw wonders: \"Am I alone in having the queasy sensation that the Wales missed penalty was the one glimmer of excitement and hope - destined therefore to be cruelly dashed - for all of the home nations tonight? If only I could really be sure of this, I can settle in to accept England's now certain fate later on...\"</p> <p>It's a good point. When was the last time they all lost on one night, anyway?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Gunter gets forward well for Wales but can;t keep his feet near the corner flag. both full-backs have been very involved for Wales, usually defending poorly and attacking well.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>40 mins:</strong> Good tackle this time by Bale on Aniukov. Arshavin tries to pick a hole in about ten Welsh defenders. Brief spell of 10-men back Keystone Cops defending. Williams hacks it desperately clear.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>42 mins: </strong> Russia showboating a little, backheels etc. which is a bit much given they're only 1-0 up and Wales have missed a penalty. But enjoy it while you can, I always say. Wales keeping their shape well.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Well, that was offside. But it was still an incredible miss by Ledley. Great ball in by Gunter, Ledley makes a lovely run, but volleys it back across the goal and wide. Good stuff by Wales. Get at Aniukov on the flank I would. </p> <p>This isn't over. Wales can score against this team. </p> <p>Just as long as they don't let in four at the other end.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>45+1 mins: </strong> <strong>Half time. </strong> and not the worst half for Wales. If they can keep their heads they could yet make a couple of chances against a slightly wobbly backline. </p> <p>Russia have looked good though and value for their 1-0 lead. </p> <p>Could have been so different though. Ah, Bale. Just blast it next time, OK?</p> <p>I'll be back presently.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>Well, Toshack can be fairly proud of his team after that. They kept pace with Russia, they looked compact in the middle. Just a problem with the full-backs losing their men. </p> <p>A look back at the Bale penalty: it was a bit weak. The goalie looked good doing his flashy dive, but would have been odd if he hadn't saved it. </p> <p>As for the Russian one, it was one of those dinky ones that almost gets saved and almost leaves the taker looking like a right twit. </p> <p>But not quite. </p> <p>Also they did one of those totally unacceptable baby-rocking celebrations. </p> <p>Maybe Wales will be bolder this half. Nothing to lose now. And Russia look a little vulnerable.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>Robert Page on Setanta is convinced Wales can get something from this. </p> <p>He is also pink and totally bald like a little baby.</p> <p>What is it with retired Welsh international footballers?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> <strong>We're off again...</strong> The rain is now \"ferocious\". And it looks it. Russia might have a bit more in the tank in the mud, given they didn't play at the weekend... Although no reason to be tired at this stage of the season.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> Russia free kick pumped into the Welsh box by Arshavin, but comes to nothing. They're not the tallest. Welsh look like they want to start quickly this half. Certainly lots of scurrying in midfield.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>49 mins:</strong> By the way Ricketts has come on for Robinson, with Bale pushing forward into midfield. Like it from Tosh. Bale looks their best player going forward, and really shaky at the back at times.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> Ooooh... That. Was. Close. Pavlyuchenko turns very easily 30 yards out and has a big swing. The ball is headed just wide by Morgan. Could have crept in very easily. The corner is cleared. </p> <p>Ledley looks to be tucking in a bit for Wales. More space out there for Bale. </p> <p>Edwards gets to the by-line and there are three Welshmen in the box, but he can't get a cross in.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>53 mins: </strong>Russia break quickly the length of the field after Ledley gives the ball away. Red shirts bursting forward form all angles, men popping up all over the shop, literally thousands of passing options... And Zhirkov shanks his shot well wide. That looked ominous.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>55 mins: </strong> Gunter gallops forward and finds himself in a bit of space so has a wallop at goal with his left foot. Ball flies miles wide. But why not? </p> <p>there is a little bit of niggle creeping into this now. One or two tasty tackles. And Wales have a bit of momentum too. Ledley's having a good game now. And Ricketts looks much more solid.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>58 mins:</strong> Arshavin has disappeared for now. That's what you want to hear if you're Welsh. <br>Wales are actually having it all right now. Fletcher takes the ball from Zyryanov, feeds Gunter, ball in which Edwards heads just over. Golly, Vokes was in if he;d left that. </p> <p>Russia have dropped very deep.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>59 mins:</strong> Having siad that Torbinsky gallops into acres of space on the right wing and puts over a cross that just swings wide. </p> <p>He's off now. First change for Hiddink. Bystrov comes on. </p> <p>Davies and Gunter work a good little pocket of spcae on the Welsh right, but the cross evades everyone.</p> <p>Still they come. Wales deserve to get something from this.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>62 mins: </strong> Evans comes on for Vokes, who has done a lot of running. Good to see Evans out there, he's a real talent.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> It's all Wales now... Corner knocked bakc to Ledley, but his long cross is too long. But it's long periods of pressure, albeit without any clear openings. Russia are really flat now. If this was England at home it would be boos all round. Rather than maniacal mass Russian yelling.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>66 mins: </strong> Ah ha. now that really was a chance for Russia. Aniukov cross from the right, Gunter slips and Arshavin just can't keep his header down. A really decent chance that. Hmm. You get the feeling Wales might have had a moment back there. and not taken it. Russia keeping possession for a bit now.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>67 mins: </strong> <strong>GOAL FOR WALES!!!</strong> Incredible scenes in Moscow. Sensational play from Bale, skipping between two Russians and playing in a brilliant low cross with his right foot. Ledley taps in. That was briloaint play by Bale, and woeful tackling by the Russian defence. </p> <p>No more than Wales deserve too.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>69 mins: </strong> That was a lovely goal. Can Wales push on from it? the last team to win here were Brazil two years ago...</p> <p>Wales are still playing with a lot of belief. Don't stop now. More of the same</p> <p>Got to say Evans looks really lively. He's won a couple of free-kicks and looks a lot more mobile than Vokes.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>73 mins</strong> Booking for Edwards, for a fould in midfield. third of the night. But Wales still look comfortable here. Russia have faded massivley and really look a little clueless. </p> <p>Oliver Pattenden says: \"There have been too many inane remarks by the Fox Soccer commentators to mention, but hearing a brash American bark 'WALES FOREVER!' after the goal is the most nauseating yet.\" </p> <p>Well, yes. But you kind of know how he feels. It;s been a really sustained, impressive comeback.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>74 mins: </strong> Bale breaks forward into the inside left channel, Evans kind of gets in his way, but he still has a shot anyway, sending the ball flying over the angle of post and bar. Lots of space there though. Get the ball to Bale I say. Going forward he's a real menace. </p> <p>Pogrebniak on for Semak.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>76 mins: </strong> Still, Wales keep on pressing down the flanks. Although, oddly Ricketts booked for time-wasting at a throw because his manager told him to wait while he brought on a sub. <br>Not really fair that.<br>Tosh is going ballistic now. Gets a telling off from the ref. But Evans is on now for Edwards.<br>And Toshack got a yellow there too. <br>Still, it wasted a few minutes, eh?</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>78 mins:</strong> Another clogging foul on Bale by Kolodin. Nice position for a free-kick. Bale floats one over the wall, but it's literally traveling at 3mph and Akinfeev catches it with one finger. </p> <p>He should have given that a right bash. Rainy night, slippery pitch and all that. </p> <p>It's still all Wales though.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> <strong>RUSSIA SCORE!!!</strong> Pogrebniak the sub gets it, rifling it in after a great save by Hennessey from Zyryanov's header. That all came form Arshavin running at Gunter from the left flank. He had a lot of space there. </p> <p>and that's dreadfully unfair on Wales. they've bossed the second half. But you've got to take your chances...</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>82 mins:</strong> It's not fair. It really isn't. Russia have been poor. And Hennessey made a great stop one-handed just before the goal. </p> <p>Extra bit of quality from Arshavin I guess made the difference. </p> <p>Bring Earnshaw on I say. </p> <p>not because he might get an equaliser. He's just fun to watch 85 mins over.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Russia coming forward with confidence now. Looking back at the goal, it was lovely play by Arshavin to get the initial cross in. the ball might have been cleared with a bit of luck after that. A bit lucky all in all...</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>87 mins:</strong> Saenko tiptoes his way through the Welsh defence from the left, but Fletcher eventually clears. </p> <p>Funny how some managers are just lucky. Hiddink always seems to get the rub of the green. </p> <p>On the other hand, it was one of his subs who got the goal. And his change of shape that put Arshavin out on the left. </p> <p>The lucky sod.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>89 mins:</strong> Wales not really able to get on the ball. they look spent here. Maybe chance for one more big attack...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 mins: </strong> Not that way. Hennessey hoofs it straight through to Akinfeev. Three mins of injury time to go. But it's all Russia now, playing it around at the back .</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins:</strong> All a bit meandering. Russian players falling over a lot. They'll be happy to get out of this one.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Hmmm. Gunter hits a volleyed cross which seemed ot hit a Russian defender somewhere near the arm. Ref waves it away. It was one of those to be honest. You never get them.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> <strong>Full time. </strong> and that's it. Russia win 2-1. Wales did enough to deserve a draw and also missed a penalty. they will take a lot of encouragement from that. Russia looked anything but invincible at home. A really strong second half from Toshack's men. </p> <p>Still, it's in the book. and that's all from me for now.</p>",
  "<p>For quiet rationality Alistair Darling's speech to the TUC yesterday was hard to fault. In troubled times, the need to maintain hard-won economic stability is more important than ever, he repeatedly told delegates in Brighton. They didn't dance in the aisles, but they didn't riot either. Darling in the lion's den was doomed to be a quiet encounter.</p> <p>The problem was that the chancellor's appearance on the rostrum was preceded by a protracted cry on pain and bewildered anger about the sheer unfairness of it all. This time (it is not always the case) the unions have an alibi: the economic crisis triggered by the credit crunch and the global commodity price spike is not their fault.</p> <p>Worse, much of the blame can easily be attached to their historic enemy, unbridled capitalism, in the shape of a greedy banking sector, bloated and overextended, which - as Darling said - didn't actually understand the risks it was taking.</p> <p>\"We only lend now to people where we understand the risk,\" one banker recently reassured Darling. But don't be fooled. They will do it again. They will. \"It's different this time,\" is a recurring battle cry of the speculator.</p> <p>In more demagogic hands than the chancellor's an anecdote like that could have got them cheering. There were other good lines like it. No more fat bonuses paid \"for big mistakes\" in banking - which should return to \"old-fashioned\" habits. No free ride for the energy giants - \"we'll do more, they must do more\". And as he rattled off those worthy reforms to improve the lives of working trade unionists since 1997, Darling said - several times - \"you campaigned for it, we agreed\" and did it.</p> <p>But Alistair Darling doesn't do red meat politics, though - as Private Eye pointed out this week - he did have a Trot phase in his political youth as a turbulent member of Lothian regional council, defying Margaret Thatcher's calls to cap the rates. It's hard to imagine now of this epitome of the clean-shaven, ultra-calm technocrat, as devoid as any politician I have known of self-promoting ego. He does extra winter fuel allowances and loft insulation, useful but uninspiring.</p> <p>So the TUC discounts its gains - don't we all? - and yesterday saw a succession of union leaders who should know better by now calling for renationalisation of the major utilities, electricity, water, gas and even the railways. A scandal that they remain in private hands 11 years after the return of a Labour government, said one.</p> <p>All right, the Tory privatisations have been a mixed bag, some of them expensive and not very good. But I am typing this in a clean, modern train carriage, speeding towards London, my laptop plugged into a power point. Most - not all - of my travel on the network is much better than it was. And, unlike for inflation, the unions do share some of the blame for the decay of the state-owned industries of the past.</p> <p>What Darling was trying to convince them of yesterday is the need to avoid a wage-price spiral of the kind we used to have in the Heath-Callaghan-Thatcher decades. Yes, oil and food prices have soared - lots of reasons for that: Iraq, the rise of the new Asian middle class, the ethanol fad - but they will settle down again. \"Tough times\", but we can get through them if we avoid the excesses of the 70s and 80s, the chancellor insisted. When inflation bites harder, the poorest suffer most and the rich - bankers included - get away with it. Some of life's unfairness is not susceptible to legislation.</p> <p>All of which is boring, but also true. Remember that the Chinese saying \"May you live in interesting times\" is a curse. We live in dull times; aren't we lucky? They may not last. Meanwhile TUC delegates, the rank and file rather less than their leaders, rage against \"obscene and immoral\" profits, the \"madness and gluttony\" of marketised energy policies, the sheer unfairness of the emerging two-tier workforce that denies decent pay and conditions to contract staff.</p> <p>Much of it is true and Darling's reminders of slow, incremental reforms (\"tips won't count as part of the minimum wage. You campaigned for it, we agreed\") are no match for stirring rhetoric and an overarching vision. \"A stable economy is not an optional extra, it's a means to an end - fairness,'' he told them. </p> <p>Admirable if dull sentiments, but it would take a Laurence Olivier or a Tony Blair to squeeze a round of applause out of such remarks. On TV yesterday's applause in the cavernous, antiseptic Brighton conference centre sounded even more tepid than the boos. The government may look anaemic, but so can the Brothers.</p>",
  "<p>The European parliament will tomorrow reaffirm binding targets for biofuels in transport and for renewables in energy use in the face of growing political resistance.</p> <p>MEPs on the parliament's key industry committee will set a mandatory target of 5% of biofuels in transport by 2015, rising to 10% by 2020.</p> <p>They will also defy objections from several governments, including Britain, and approve in principle a system of penalties for countries which fail to meet interim targets for renewable energy.</p> <p>Claude Turmes, Green MEP and rapporteur on the renewables directive, said after exhaustive talks with political groups to consider up to 2000 amendments said he was now optimistic the new law could be approved before the end of the year. He said he had won support across the political spectrum for his compromises.</p> <p>Biofuels have increasingly come under attack for allegedly causing land used for food and animal feed to be switched to fuel crops and for being a prime cause of soaring food and commodity prices. </p> <p>A protagonist of scrapping the controversial biofuels target, Turmes said the agreed compromise would see second-generation biofuels - from non-food, non-feed crops - gradually play a greater role.</p> <p>In the interim stage, he said, second-generation biofuels would provide 1% of the overall 5% target and, in the second stage, 4% of the 10% target. The original scheme was for biofuels to provide 5.75% of transport fuel by 2010.</p> <p>Electric and hydrogen-fuelled cars would play a substantial role in meeting these targets despite scepticism that manufacturers can either produce enough or sell them. But they would only count if the electricity or hydrogen came from verifiably \"green\" sources.</p> <p>Other biofuels will only be counted towards the overall targets if they meet tougher sustainability criteria than proposed by the European commission or many governments. Turmes said the agreed compromise would mean that fuels saving 45% of carbon emissions would count - rather than the 35% proposed earlier. In time this could rise to 60%.</p> <p>The targets and standards will provoke a row with European biofuel producers who claim they are being forced out of their home markets by subsidised imports. The European Biodiesel Board (EBB) said biofuel production was not the cause of commodity price rises and the fuels involved met higher sustainability criteria than allowed by the EC.</p> <p>Much of European biofuels come from rapeseed oil which, the EC says, saves 36% of carbon emissions - just meeting the standard. But the EBB's secretary-general, Raffaello Garofalo, said the savings were much higher.</p> <p>Tomorrow's vote at the European parliament, meanwhile, is also expected to provoke disputes with governments as MEPs should approve plans to give priority access to power grids for electricity produced from renewables, potentially shutting down coal-fired and nuclear plants. Britain is a leading opponent of the scheme, arguing that it interferes with market forces.</p>",
  "<p>All three main political parties have downgraded their commitment to the environment over the last year, a report by the UK's major green groups said today.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/grea_p.aspx?id=3202\">Fit for the Future</a> study, which analysed the green performance of all three parties over the past year, said many politicians believed the economic downturn made action on the environment less of a priority.</p> <p>Over the last year, all three main parties had \"retreated from the environmental agenda\", said the report, which was drawn up by a coalition including the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), Friends of the Earth, Green Alliance, Greenpeace, National Trust, RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust and WWF.</p> <p>The only way out of the downturn was an ambitious climate change strategy that addressed energy, transport, and management, housing and the economy, the second annual review of the parties' performance said.</p> <p>The three parties must drastically improve their green performance in the run-up to the next election, the environmental organisations urged.</p> <p>Stephen Hale, director of Green Alliance, said on behalf of the groups: \"None of the three main parties are currently showing the vision and courage to prepare the UK for the challenges ahead.</p> <p>\"There is no long-term route to prosperity and security unless our political leaders tackle climate change and protect the natural environment.</p> <p>\"In a time of rising fuel and food costs, the need for an ambitious approach to environmental policy has never been clearer.\"</p> <p>The Labour government's approach to the environment had become \"incoherent and contradictory\", the report said.</p> <p>On the upside, the government had introduced the climate change bill and a draft strategy on renewable energy but there were concerns about the failure to rule out a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth, Kent, and Gordon Brown's trip to Jeddah to plead for higher oil production.</p> <p>The government won praise for protecting the natural world through measures such as the marine bill, avoiding a badger cull and protecting Lyme Bay from damaging fishing practices.</p> <p>But the green groups said the government should have used rises in fuel prices to push through a reduction in the UK's dependence on fossil fuels, and criticised the \"inadequate\" action on biofuels.</p> <p>The Conservatives came under fire for an \"increasingly alarming\" gap between their green aspirations and commitments, and for failing to mention the environment or climate change in their statement on priorities for a future government following the May elections.</p> <p>The party was also criticised for its negative attitude to green taxes and for sidelining its quality of life review, which set out a green agenda, but they did win support for saying no to dirty coal.</p> <p>Even the Liberal Democrats, traditionally strong on the environment, have seen their lead on green issues \"wane\" at points during the year.</p> <p>But they were applauded for Nick Clegg's commitment to making the UK energy independent and zero carbon by 2050, a move which was described in the report as \"brave and bold\", and for strengthening the climate change bill.</p> <p>The report called on all the parties to say yes to meeting targets to source 15% of energy from renewables by 2020 and to valuing the natural environment.</p> <p>It also said they should introduce a \"massive uplift\" in energy efficiency through public investment.</p> <p>And the parties should say no to unabated coal power stations and to expanding Heathrow or Stansted airports.</p> <p>The shadow environment secretary, Peter Ainsworth, said: \"We are continuing to take forward important policy proposals to make Britain greener and safer, including a major initiative on creating a low-carbon economy.\"</p> <p>And the Lib Dem environment spokesman, Steve Webb, said his party had been working in recent months on less high-profile but potentially more important measures such as strengthening the climate change bill.</p> <p>Responding to the Fit for the Future report, environment minister Phil Woolas said: \"We welcome the fact that the report acknowledges the good work the government is doing - both our flagship pieces of legislation, the climate change and draft marine bills, are cited.</p> <p>\"Government is committed to tackling environment issues and helping people through difficult economic times - it's not an either or.</p> <p>\"Our drive to increase energy efficiency in homes throughout the country illustrates that.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you want to get ahead, it's not what you know it's who you know. This is manifestly false if, say, you're a manicurist who wants to become a neurosurgeon. I can't help thinking that in this case knowing how to handle a scalpel rather than a nail file is fairly vital, no matter how many doctors you make friends with or how well you tell that joke about a very small pianist.</p> <p>Still, we've all realised after a short time in any job that the way to progress is a combination of sparkling repartee and not throwing up in the shrubs at company barbecues. You can be as good as you like, but the person who gets promoted will probably be the one who pretended to enjoy metal detecting and slaps people's backs when it counts. </p> <p>It makes sense, I suppose. If you have to work with someone every day it's pretty important that he or she is not an appalling human being. And it helps if he or she has things in common with you. So when it comes to hiring someone, you're more likely to pick the person who demonstrated that they share your love of putting ships in bottles or the sitcom Keeping Up Appearances while chatting in an informal setting.</p> <p>Dreadful as the prospect is, networking works. Which is why people have business cards, practice handshakes and, in extreme cases, play golf. No one knows why so many people choose to bond with their colleagues over golf. Perhaps because even the deeply unfit can play. Perhaps because \"business casual\" entails chinos and mobile phone holsters anyway, so everyone's dressed for it. Perhaps because it's so dull that talking about balance sheets is fascinating in comparison. Or maybe it's just that it's hard to chat while base jumping. </p> <p>Next time you are in a social environment working out how to do this networking thing without coming off as utterly desperate, be aware that other, less circumspect, individuals have you in their sights and are calculating whether they can use you for career advancement. We've all met these people. They talk to you at parties while looking over your shoulder in case someone more important comes past. You can see them assessing your precise social ranking and proceeding accordingly with their schmoozing. </p> <p>Social networking sites like Facebook have only exacerbated matters. You know how it is; you meet someone once, feel obliged to accept their friend request and then have to put up with their dreadful status updates and pictures of their holidays forever more. And even though they're not alerted if you defriend them, they will eventually discover you missing from their list and feel slighted. So you can't get rid of them. </p> <p>The same, however, is also true of their low-tech business cards. I've got a drawer-full, and keep finding others in the most unlikely places. I have no idea why, for example, one ended up in my bathroom cabinet next to the nail clippers. But I don't want to throw any away - even the one from the \"creativity coach\" - just in case they come in handy. So if you're the guy who put up my friend's TV mount in April, don't forget about me. I have your card and I'll be calling you sometime in the next few years. </p> <p>Of course the worst networkers are the namedroppers. It works on every level. If you're in a small company in Leicester, there'll be a junior member of staff who talks about this great conversation they had with the CEO in a lift. If you're working at MGM there'll be an extra who talks about shooting hoops with George Clooney. And refers to him as \"G\". </p> <p>This is unforgiveable and idiotic. Handily enough, almost everyone dislikes such people. And thus they achieve the exact opposite of their aims - de-networking or anti-schmoozing, if you will, sending them sliding down the career ladder at precisely the speed they hoped to be climbing it. In theory, at least.</p>",

  "<p>Wearing surgical masks and carrying umbrellas, residents in Gao'antun, Chaoyang district of Beijing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/31/beijing.pollution.protest\">blocked roads</a>, chanted anti-pollution slogans and refused to allow rubbish trucks to pass as dozens of police filmed them and appealed for calm. This happened just one week after the close of the Beijing Olympic Games. Another week later, a local official formally apologised to the public and promised to reduce the odor in 20 days.</p> <p>Many see this as a positive sign that Chinese government is becoming more transparent and democratic \u2013 possibly another Olympic legacy. But since residents have endured the terrible living environment for more than three years, no one should be very optimistic.</p> <p>Protest is strictly regulated in China. According to the law, people can only hold a protest after permission is granted from the authorities. Whether you can protest or not is at the officials' discretion. The protest zones set up in Beijiing in a rush weeks before the Olympics were supposed to allow people to have somewhere to stage their protests, but they stayed quiet during the games. Hundreds of applications were handed in, but none permitted. What an irony.<br> Is the application process actually a trap? Most people believe so. Two 80-year-old ladies were given a year's \"re-education through labour\" after applying to hold a protest to complain about their houses being torn down by property developers. </p> <p>It is also worth noting that police actively filmed people taking part in the peaceful protest and it will come as no surprise if participants get some trouble once the dust has settled. In Chinese there's an expression: \"Square accounts after the autumn harvest\" - which means to wait until after a political movement is finished to settle accounts with the leaders and their followers. Last year, in Shengzhou City in Jiangsu Province, tens of thousands of people went on the street to protest against local government who forcibly dismantled a 90-year-old man's house. Two months after the riot, police reviewed the films and arrested people who were involved.</p> <p>Peaceful protests happen from time to time, mostly in the big cities like Beijing, and mostly held by the middle-class people who fear to lose their jobs and freedom, and who won't use any more drastic forms of protest. Local police also tend to think twice before using force or causing a scene, not only because of the scrutiny of media, but also the participants' growing awareness of their rights. But it would be naive to imagine that peaceful protests is becoming a normal way to solve public complaints in China.</p> <p>Early this month, a <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D932LGU00.htm\">protest broke out</a> in the southern Hunnan Province. In Jishou, a small city, tens of thousands of people blocked streets and railways, demanding the return of their money invested in a private finance scheme. For years, the local property and mining firms extracted billions of yuans from local people by promising extremely high returns. </p> <p>Local officials clearly not only sanctioned the scheme, but were also directly involved in the investment. They are said to have taken their money out of the scheme about a month before the government announced its closure, causing losses for other investors. </p> <p>Having the police by their side to crack down any civil unrest, and having a tight grip of the local media to stop any bad news, officials in the rural areas behave like emperors. Nobody dares to challenge their authority. </p> <p>China is getting stronger economically. However in terms of democracy and transparenet governance, there have been more setbacks than steps forward in the past decade. Now, China is reaching an impasse which hinders further development. Without serious political reform, the country will not be able to solve the ever-intensifying social conflicts. What's looming large, and what's more threatening, is ever more drastic forms of unrest in remote and rural areas, rather than peaceful protest in the large cities.</p>",
  "<p><br>Lee Hurst ... You wouldn't like him when he's angry</p> <p>Comedian Lee Hurst is the latest performer to succumb to \"<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre/news/comedians-stage-rage-investigated-by-police-923482.html\">stage rage</a>\" according to reports, after last week mauling the mobile phone of a punter who was paying him undue attention at a gig in Surrey. Hurst's fit was sparked by the winking lights of a mobile phone somewhere in his audience last Wednesday at the Stoke pub in Guildford. The ex-They Think It's All Over pundit then unleashed the standard-issue \"four-letter tirade\", seized the phone, threw it on the floor and flounced off.<br> Apparently Hurst thought the punter was secretly filming his gig. Which would have been quite understandable \u2013 who wouldn't want 20 grainy minutes of cockney comedy in their collection? In fact, his victim claims to have been texting a babysitter. Police are now deciding whether to bring charges \u2013 a decision I'm happy to make for them, if that'll ease their workload. No. Don't bring charges. That would be stupid.</p> <p>Even if the punter was indeed messaging the childminder, that's a very annoying thing to do in a darkened room full of people trying to be entertained, and a battered hand-set sounds like just desserts. I'd even say his fellow audience members had more cause for rage than Hurst, whose job, after all, is to be so amusing that no one's thinking about the babysitter in the first place.<br> And yet, the psychology of stage rage is quite understandable. Performers \u2013 stand-up comics particularly \u2013 are totally exposed on stage, and they live or die by their ability to compel and calibrate the attention of the audience. A persistent, focus-hogging irritant in the crowd can jeopardise everything. The skilled performer will defuse this threat with the firm-but-fair reprimand. Witness Richard Griffiths in The History Boys. \"You should be ashamed of yourselves,\" he told a woman whose phone kept ringing. \"I am not going to compete with these electronic devices. We're going to start this scene again. If we hear one more phone go off, we'll quit this performance.\" Or Kevin Spacey to the owner of a ringing mobile during The Iceman Cometh. \"Tell them we're busy,\" he said. Sometimes the angry approach works. The actor Laurence Fishburne apparently won applause from the crowd when he barked \"turn that fucking phone off\" during a Broadway performance of James Goldman's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/535028.stm\">The Lion in Winter</a>. But there will always be performers who \u2013 catch them on a bad night \u2013 can't keep their fury in check. The most notorious recent incident involves Michael (Kramer from Seinfeld) Richards' <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/tv/2006/11/seinfeld_star_goes_beyond_a_jo.html\">racist tirade against hecklers</a> in his audience at a West Hollywood comedy club in 2006. Richards claims that his outburst was a misguided effort to be funny. He's had two years of subsequent pariah status to rue the misjudgment. Next to that fate, a \"grievous digital harm\" rap from the Surrey police seems an entirely acceptable punishment.</p>",
  "<p>Empowerment guides much of Amref's work in Katine. The focus is on improving people's engagement with local government structures. Empowerment is seen as a thread that links together the work being done to improve access to <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/water\">water</a>, <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/health\">heath</a>, <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/livelihoods\">agriculture</a> and <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/education\">education</a> sectors. </p> <p>Empowerment is to be achieved through building institutional structures, around questions of budgeting and planning, that will also enable people to make demands of their <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/governance\">leaders</a> at the local, sub-county and district levels.</p> <p>That said, it is never directly spelled out what is meant by the term in Amref's six-month review.</p> <p>Before getting into any discussion about empowerment it is worth saying something about power. A classic definition is that of the political theorist <a href=\" http://www.yale-university.com/polisci/dahl/index.htm\"> Robert Dahl</a>.</p> <p>\"A has power over B to the extent to which A can get B to do something which B would not have done otherwise.\"</p> <p>Whether it is the Ugandan government getting people to pay taxes, or a family \"arranging\" a marriage for a daughter, there are many instances of this sort of coercive power in Katine. Amref's focus on better governance aims to make changes in the way local government works. But we should also recognise that their work in agriculture, health and education are likely to impact power relations at the household and community levels.</p> <p>Of all of the definitions of empowerment \u2013 and there are many - Julian Rappaport's is perhaps the easiest to follow:</p> <p>\"Empowerment involves people assuming control or mastery over their own lives.\"</p> <p>In other words real empowerment means a situation where B is less and less compelled to do A's bidding; where people are increasingly able to stand up to those who exercise power.</p> <p>As the above suggests, meaningful empowerment will always be contentious. And any successful empowerment strategy will, in the end, challenge vested interests.</p> <p>In Amref's work the emphasis is on building up community structures to challenge and question the work of local government. For Amref, too little effort has been invested in building up local level structures to hold politicians and civil servants to account. This is what the organisation terms a \"supply side\" problem - too little attention has been given to generating demand. The resultant situation is one where citizens have remained passive to events and public decisions that affect them.</p> <p>I am not so sure.</p> <p>One concern I have is that development agencies tend to put the burden on communities when talking about empowerment. They fail to ask serious questions about the power people have, and where real power is located in the system. Empowerment is often depoliticised, stripped of its political meaning. The <a href=\" http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTEMPOWERMENT/0,,contentMDK:20245753~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:486411,00.html\">World Bank definition</a> being a case in point:</p> <p>\"Empowerment is the process of increasing the capacity of individuals or groups to make choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes. Central to this process are actions which both build individual and collective assets, and improve the efficiency and fairness of the organisational and institutional context which govern the use of these assets.\" </p> <p>A much more vague and wordy definition of empowerment than Rappaport's.</p> <p>It seems to me that a major problem with the government system in Katine is the fact that those who work for the state are uninterested in the countryside. This is because of a basic political economy problem. The tax taken rarely exceeds 10% of the district budget; most of the budget comes from the national government or foreign donors. In such a situation why would civil servants listen to constituents? Those living in rural areas lack economic power when it comes to dealing with the state. </p> <p>What strikes me most is the powerlessness of those living in the countryside. Alongside the voiceless poor, there are schoolteachers, health workers, community organisers, and village chiefs who have little or no influence over what the state does or does not do. This is not because they lack information, or opinions, or because they are not <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/aug/26/background.livelihoods\">frustrated</a> with the pace of change. It is because they lack leverage. Power is somewhere else.</p> <p>I would suggest that Amref's focus on the rural economy, on raising incomes and generating wealth, may in the end, be the most important empowerment strategy for those living in Katine.</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to a <a href=\"http://www.eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=20416\">collapsed ceiling</a> in its Strasbourg chamber, the European parliament will have to stay in Brussels for its plenary session later this month. Yet it would be fanciful to imagine that the respite offered to MEPs from their exhausting high-carbon commute will make them more clear-headed than normal when crafting legislation. For many of them appear intent on using the occasion to mount an ill-conceived attack on civil liberties. </p> <p>Around the same time it emerged that discs containing sensitive information on 25 million child benefit claimants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/25/immigrationpolicy.economy\">went missing</a> in Britain last year, the European commission <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/com/com_com(2007)0698_/COM_COM(2007)0698_en.pdf\">proposed (pdf)</a> a mandatory notification scheme in cases where a security breach leads to a loss of personal data. The broad thrust of that proposal \u2013 known as the electronic privacy directive \u2013 appeared sensible. But now MEPs want to transform the package so that rather than helping to enhance privacy, it will erode it.</p> <p>The parliament's position \u2013 drafted by British Conservative <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/searchForm/view.do?id=4538&amp;language=en\">Malcolm Harbour</a> \u2013 favours a \"three-strike\" system to allow music or film companies to monitor the downloading of copyrighted material by effectively spying on internet users. First, copyright holders could store the internet protocol (IP) addresses \u2013 the string of numbers that can identify the computer onto which an individual has logged. Second, the internet firm to which a downloader is subscribed would issue him or her with a warning. And third, the person's internet connection could be cut off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/lang/en/pid/26\">Peter Hustinx</a>, the EU's data protection supervisor, has argued that the recommended system is \"highly invasive of an individual's private sphere and also jeopardises freedom of speech\". This week he called on Harbour to devise safeguards in order to avoid \"the systematic and pro-active surveillance of internet usage\".<br> Ever since it started regarding the internet as a threat to the CD, the music industry has shamelessly tried to use almost every available weapon against downloading. When the EU institutions were discussing a <a href=\"http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-71913\">zany plan</a> \u2013 presented as an anti-terrorism measure \u2013 for storing data on every phone call made and email sent on the union's territory a few years ago, Hollywood studios and major record companies joined forces to argue that its remit should be widened from terrorist offences to file-sharing. </p> <p>More recently, the Spanish producers and publishers group Promusicae <a href=\"http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1201610823.27/\">lost</a> a court battle aimed at forcing internet firms to hand over details on their clients. In that case, the European court of justice ruled that while both privacy and intellectual property can be regarded as fundamental rights, there is no obligation to transfer personal data in such circumstances. </p> <p>Paul McGuinness, the U2 manager, has <a href=\"http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/paul-mcguinness-June2008.pdf\">claimed (pdf)</a> that this verdict illustrated how a balance needs to be struck between these different rights. He claimed, too, that nobody is asking internet providers to be the \"police force on the internet\" or is advocating the monitoring of what websites people visit. Yet the proposals being considered in the European parliament do provide for such sweeping measures. </p> <p>The notion that people who do nothing more sinister than access music without paying should be treated as criminals has always been perverse. Using a drop in record sales as a pretext for mass surveillance is even more so.</p>",
  "<p>The Bush White House's public declaration of neutrality in Pakistan's presidential contest failed to dispel the view of most analysts that Asif Ali Zardari, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/07/pakistan.zardari.election\">who won the office</a> on Saturday had the tacit approval of Washington. After all, of the three candidates for the high office, Zardari was the one who promised a stiffer campaign against Taliban and al-Qaida militants based in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).<br> But promising is one thing, delivering quite another. The task of ridding Pakistan of Islamist extremists rests primarily with the military and the paramilitary Frontier Corps which, in normal circumstances, should operate under civilian authority. But there have been several instances in Pakistani history when this has not happened, and the army chief of staff has usurped the ultimate power. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's overthrow by General Pervez Musharraf in 1999 was the latest example. Though civilian rule was restored in February, the domineering role of the armed forces remains intact. Like most such institutions, the Pakistani military has its doctrine. It is that India is Pakistan's number one rival and adversary. Secondly, due to the narrow shape of Punjab, its heartland, Pakistan lacks strategic depth, a vital factor in a conventional war. The only way Pakistan can overcome this severe handicap is by acquiring dominant influence in Afghanistan.  Out of this strategic thinking emerged the idea of creating the Taliban by the military's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate in 1994, when Afghanistan was in the middle of a civil war. By 2001, the Taliban came to control 95% of Afghanistan. And Pakistan was one of the only three countries that recognised its government.  9/11 changed all that. Pressured by President George Bush, Musharraf did an abrupt turnaround \u2013 for a price. For his cooperation with Washington, Pakistan was to get generous aid in cash and weapons. Yet thousands of Taliban fighters and al-Qaida leaders and their contingents easily slipped into Pakistan in late 2001. Musharraf blamed the chaos that followed in Afghanistan and the adjoining Fata after the Taliban rout.  Once the situation stabilised somewhat, his government differentiated between the Afghan Taliban and the non-Afghan al-Qaida hierarchy. It trained its guns on the latter. And its success in catching a top al-Qaida leader periodically placated Washington sufficiently to maintain its supply of US money and arms, which totalled $10bn by 2007.  Meanwhile, the ISI turned a blind eye as the re-assembled Afghan Taliban leaders, functioning from the Pakistani city of Quetta, expanded their organisation. Operating from Fata, the Taliban has established control over parts of the rural areas in southern and eastern Afghanistan. It also enjoys <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07pakistan-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=dexter%20filkins&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2\">popular support</a> on both sides of the border in Fata. </p> <p>This fits the agenda of the ISI, which has all along conceived the Afghan Taliban as its proxy in Afghanistan. The fact that the Taliban has become a virtually autonomous entity, deriving its revenue from the thriving drugs trade of Afghanistan, does not seem to worry the ISI. </p> <p>It is alarmed by the speed with which India has been building up its influence in post-Taliban Afghanistan with lavish aid in cash and technical expertise in constructing the country's infrastructure. Delhi has cordial relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai who, during his exile, obtained a postgraduate degree from an Indian university before moving to the United States. It is worth noting that the Karzai government publicly alleged the hand of the ISI in the recent suicide bomb attack on the large Indian embassy in Kabul. <br> Equally noteworthy is the news that most of the military aid that Washington has provided to Pakistan has been used to bolster its defences against India rather than beef up its capacity to fight the Islamist terrorists in Fata.  So unless Pakistan's military high command drops its anti-India doctrine, there is no chance of the ISI ending its clandestine links with the Afghan Taliban \u2013 no matter how vociferously President Zardari rails against the deeply embedded militant organisation.</p>"
