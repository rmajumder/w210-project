  "<p>Martin Lawrence is a broad comic who has cleaned up his act for this sentimental and chillingly brain-dead family comedy from Disney about an adorably over-protective dad who doesn't want his talented teen daughter Melanie (Raven-Symon\u00e9) to go to Georgetown law school because it's too far away from the family nest. When she is offered a last-minute interview there, he offers to drive her all the way, with a sneaky plan to sabotage the whole deal - and the script has to come up with all sorts of convoluted stopover plans to explain away the fact that they're not simply taking the plane. (Sopranos fans will remember a famous episode where Tony drives his daughter Meadow on a similar college road trip, and recognises someone he needs to whack. It had a thousand times more wit and insight than this.) Incredibly, the movie boasts a cameo from, of all people, Donny Osmond, playing another wackily over-protective dad. He's actually far from being an incompetent performer, though this doesn't make him or anyone else any easier to watch.</p>",
  "<p>Graham Parr was at least partly responsible for getting the Rolling Stones banned from Blackpool in 1964. At the age of 14, he sneaked off to a now infamous gig where a riot began when a member of the audience spat at Brian Jones. In the mayhem that followed, Parr somehow got a black eye. When he got home, he got another one from his police chief father who decided the band would never play in the seaside resort again. The ban, which lasted for 44 years, was only lifted in March. </p> <p>He chuckles as he recalls how he happened to find himself on a train opposite Charlie Watts a few years ago, accidentally sitting in one of the ring of vacant seats the Stones drummer's secretary had booked him to keep the public at arm's length. He took the chance to apologise. \"You couldn't make it up,\" he says, in a Lancashire accent.</p> <p>Parr is a big man, and spends much of the interview leaning back in his chair with his hands resting behind his head, his cuffs riding up to show a gold and silver watch strap. He has a couple of buttons undone on his blue shirt and hair skirting the back of his collar. He moved to Blackpool at the age of six and the resort seems to run through him like the words in a stick of rock. </p> <p><strong>Growth</strong></p> <p>After leaving school he was a Bluecoat at the local Pontin's, and became a management trainee. While he was working for rival Warner Holidays in 1987, the chance arose to buy Pontin's with friend and Blackpool Tower owner Trevor Hemmings for \u00a357.5m. They sold the business again two years later, to Scottish &amp; Newcastle for \u00a3115m. That was not a bad deal, I suggest. He clenches his fists, bobs in his seat and mugs like Les Dawson in mock celebration. \"Anyway, we did all right,\" he deadpans.</p> <p>That wasn't the end of his relationship with the holiday camp business. This year, Parr was offered the chance to buy Pontin's back. He set up Ocean Parcs and took over the company for \u00a346m in March. Bookings are running more than 10% ahead of last year against the backdrop of a miserable economy and strong euro, which are encouraging people to holiday at home. The firm expects 750,000 visitors before the year is out.</p> <p>\"We are seeing large growth in the volume of people coming on holiday but the spend on-site is lower than it has been in previous years,\" he says. \"You see people arriving and they're taking the Lidl and the Aldi bags out of the boot of the car. You can see them with half-bottles of gin that are going into handbags when they go into the bars.\"</p> <p>Fred Pontin opened for business in 1946, guessing that people in austere postwar Britain were in need of cheap holiday destinations. The first camp was in Brean, Somerset, on the site of buildings that had been used by US forces practising for the Normandy landings. By 1975, he had built 25 self-catering villages and was locked in battle with Butlins. Pontin introduced the Bluecoats in the 1960s, as a reply to the Redcoats of his arch-rival. He sold the business to the leisure group Coral in 1978 and it has changed hands several times since. Today there are seven sites remaining.</p> <p>Parr is appraising the sites and is looking at alternative uses for some. For those that remain as holiday camps, the accommodation, largely built in the 1960s and 1970s, will be rebuilt and sold to investors as individual units. The properties will then be managed by Pontin's and rented out to holidaymakers, with the aim of providing a return of 5-6% a year to the owners, as well as a free holiday. It is a model widely used in caravan parks. The aim is to get other people to pay for the redevelopment of the camps. The leasehold units will be put on the market for between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3120,000.</p> <p>The Pontin's name will still be used on some of the camps \"where appropriate\" and the others will be renamed Ocean Parcs. \"I'll keep something of the name for the old guy, because I have great affection for him,\" Parr says.</p> <p>Parr says he still gets people calling out \"Hi-de-hi\" when they find out what he does, even though the BBC series has been off-air for 20 years. It was filmed in the Warner holiday village in Dovercourt when he was working there. \"At the end of the season, they used to plant a big bronze statue, of course it wasn't real bronze, of Joe Maplin. They would turn up and stick plastic roses in the ground because all the roses had gone by that time, and they would film all the episodes in about two weeks.\"</p> <p>Is it something of an albatross? \"It is and it isn't. The brand awareness is amazing, if you go out on the street and you mention the words Butlins and Pontin's to any English person, they will say holiday camps, so at least they know what it is and that is something.\"</p> <p>Is he nostalgic for the heyday of Pontin's? \"I think the most disappointing thing is the way that the British holiday experience, resort, call it what you like, has deteriorated, and luckily at the very last moment, investment is starting to come back in and it is getting better. If you take Blackpool as an example, I mean it really did get into some dire, dire straits in terms of its marketing, the level of violence and drunkenness, and it is not just Blackpool but all over.\"</p> <p>One of Parr's many business interests down the years was the Harry Ramsden's chain of fish and chip shops, one of which was in Blackpool. \"From about the early 90s we used to build into the budget about \u00a3500 a week for people kicking the glass in, and we'd invariably spend it because every night somewhere or other some drunken yob would take a swing with his boot at a pane of glass.\" He got so fed up with the situation that he sold up. \"But I really do see a resurgence and an improvement - if we invest properly, people respect that and if we are careful in the way that we manage the leisure assets, it will stop the yob element; we almost were in danger of giving in to it, but I think people have just had enough.\"</p> <p><strong>Jive</strong></p> <p>I mention that as a youngster in east London I would jealously listen to stories of people going to \"soul weekenders\" at Pontin's in Camber Sands. It still hosts them, Parr says, as well as other special events, from chess tournaments to salsa weekends.</p> <p>He launches into another anecdote. \"I was in Green's restaurant in Duke Street, St James's, which is owned by Simon Parker Bowles, and he said 'I see Pontin's are in The Field' [the magazine for country sports]. And I said 'Really?'. Because I do a bit of shooting and a bit of fishing, and I'd not really looked at that month's yet. And he said, 'Well, you're in it'. </p> <p>\"So I get home, open it up and obviously this journo was short of something to do in July because there is not a lot of shooting going on, but she was obviously a fan of jive dancing and we do jive-dancing weekends at Pontin's, and sure enough, she had gone down to Camber Sands and there was a whole article in The Field. I mean how on earth do you get Pontin's in The Field? I was completely oblivious to the whole bloody thing. They didn't ask. It was a very good article but I'm not sure if it is our target market I have to say,\" and he collapses into a wheezy silent laughter.</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>January 5 1950 in Preston, Lancashire</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Blackpool Grammar school</p> <p><strong>Career </strong>Worked in Blackpool leisure sector as a student.</p> <p><strong>1969-1983</strong> Joined Pontin's as a trainee manager and worked up to regional manager</p> <p><strong>1983-1987</strong> Managing director of Warner Holidays, part of Grand Metropolitan Leisure</p> <p><strong>1987-1994</strong> Bought Pontin's with Trevor Hemmings and sold it two years later, staying on as managing director</p> <p><strong>1994-2000</strong> Bought Harry Ramsden's and was a non-executive director until it was sold to Compass</p> <p><strong>1997-2000 </strong>Set up Arena Leisure and acquired racecourses including those at Lingfield, Folkestone, Wolverhampton and Windsor</p> <p><strong>2003-present</strong> Chairman of Gaming International</p> <p><strong>2006-present</strong> Chairman of Probability.</p> <p>Married with two children and two grandchildren</p>",

Earlier in the campaign, McCain said he believed the US economy remained strong, while an adviser had dismissed concern about the housing crisis and petrol prices as whining.</p>",
  "<p>Zenph Studios specialises in catching every fuzzy nuance of old lo-fi recordings, and then faithfully redelivering the music on automated modern instruments. Glenn Gould's 1955 Goldberg Variations, recovered this way, stunned the experts - and the late Oscar Peterson, piano protege of jazz keyboard colossus Art Tatum, had to call for the tissues when he heard these uncanny \"reperformances\" from 1949. Purists may wince at the thought of a computer-driven piano that's never had Tatum's magic fingers touch its keys. But others will be grateful to hear a tour de force live performance from the pianist whom even Rachmaninoff and Horowitz loved, without the distortions of 1940s technology. The 13-piece repertoire is featured twice; there is also a headphone-dedicated version to let air-piano fantasists hear the music unfolding much as Tatum would have done from the stool. And, even if you tire of the rippling downward fill after almost every turn of a melody, the playing remains breathtaking. Check out the flying account of Tiger Rag, the impulsive Tatum Pole Boogie and the mingling of lazy tenderness and bursting assertiveness on Someone to Watch Over Me.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners yesterday urged ministers to intervene over soaring household fuel bills after two more energy suppliers announced rises in gas and electricity prices, affecting millions of customers.</p> <p>Scottish and Southern Energy, Britain's second biggest supplier, with almost nine million customers, said that from Monday it would increase gas prices by almost 30% and electricity by nearly a fifth. </p> <p>E.ON, which has about 5.5 million customers, has raised its gas bills by 26% and electricity by 16%, from today. British Gas and EDF Energy raised prices last month. </p> <p>With wholesale gas prices setting a record yesterday the last of the big six energy suppliers, Scottish Power and npower, are expected to raise prices soon.</p> <p>The latest increases are expected to push a further 890,000 households into fuel poverty - the level defined as personal spending on energy being more than 10% of income - finds the price comparison site uSwitch.com. That would take the total in fuel poverty to 5.4 million. </p> <p>Average bills for dual-fuel customers, of the four firms that have raised prices, are now between \u00a31,211-\u00a31,328 a year, uSwitch estimates. Ann Robinson, uSwitch.com's director of consumer policy, said soaring bills posed \"a huge threat\" to standards of living. \"Gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury many cannot afford. The government needs to provide a strategic, regulatory, environment to ensure the lights stay on at an affordable price.\"</p> <p>Gordon Lishman, Age Concern's director general, said one in three pensioner households likely to experience fuel poverty by the end of the year would feel forced to cut back on food or fuel. \"The government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action.\"</p> <p>He called for fuel vouchers for the poorest pensioners and for the government to make it mandatory for energy firms to offer social tariffs at the cheapest rates.</p> <p>The Tories yesterday announced plans to cut the fuel bills of the poorest by helping those without bank accounts - who at present pay more for settling in cash - to use post office card accounts to get the equivalent of cheaper direct debits. Currently these accounts are only used for receipt of state benefits. Figures given to the Tories by the group Energywatch show that people using direct debit pay on average \u00a380 less a year than cash payers.</p> <p>The pensions reform minister, Mike O'Brien, queried the Tories' estimate on cutting the energy bills of up to four million people with post office accounts, saying they had not mentioned the three million or so who had building society or bank accounts and so access to direct debit. And as a key government aim was to cut the number of people on benefits, a policy that entrenched accounts only available to benefit recipients was undesirable.</p> <p>But the Tory plan was welcomed by the Citizens Advice Bureau. Its policy director, Theresa Perchard, said: \"This proposal offers to put more money in the pockets of poorer consumers by reducing their outgoings and providing for weekly budgeting to avoid debt.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform, said: \"We are deeply concerned about the effects of household price rises on hard-pressed families and other vulnerable people.\" The government had asked Ofgem for guidelines stressing that firms' social tariffs be set at the lowest prices. \"We ... reached an agreement with them to treble the amount they spend to help the poorest ... this will provide an extra \u00a3225m over the next three years and could help 100,000 households who struggle to keep their homes warm in the winter.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lassus. Bach. Bruckner. Stravinsky. In our historically aware times, such musicians tend to get locked away in separate boxes, where each requires specialist interpreters and audiences who are looking for different kinds of musical experience. It would certainly seem that these composers are poles apart, and not just in terms of their musical styles. </p> <p>Lassus was employed as a servant of the church and aristocracy, composing at a time when music was understood as a mathematical science wedded to a religious function. Stravinsky, by contrast, operated in a highly cosmopolitan society in which composers were lionised, ranked among the leading intellectual voices of their time and music. Bruckner, again by contrast, was composing at a time when music was considered the greatest of the arts, and when a whole tranche of Austro-German society was arguing passionately about the direction music should take. But Bruckner travelled little, unlike both Lassus and Stravinsky, and was shy, devout, socially gauche and spiritually intense. More than the passing of centuries separates these composers. And yet they were unified by one thing: the search in music for a realm in which the mind is free to confront the mystery of its creation.</p> <p>As a so-called baroque specialist who chooses to work with period instruments, I am one of those who helped create, if not the boxes themselves, then the attitude that says, \"this is the way we must perform this or that music\". Period musicianship is about bringing the music of all periods to life, not putting it in the right place on the shelf.</p> <p>People still express surprise when they hear that I am performing Bruckner, or Mahler and Stravinsky. As one of the second generation of what is still called the \"early music\" movement (even though what is now called early music was written far earlier than anything that requires a conductor), I should perhaps not be surprised by this. In those days, we had to be evangelical, dogmatic even, to get our message across, so I can understand it if people put us performers in boxes that it seems we made ourselves. It is also true that when I perform Bruckner - either the symphonies, with the Orchestre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, or the choral music with the Collegium Vocale - I like to carry over into this 19th-century repertoire the same principles I put to work in the music of the German and French baroque.</p> <p>But what I am searching for is not \"authenticity\" in the way this term is usually understood. We cannot hear Bach's cantatas as the congregation in Leipzig heard them because we are very different people, just as we cannot hear Bruckner's music as he heard it. But what we can hear, or can help to communicate as performers, is an authenticity in the sense of allowing the music to be true to itself. </p> <p>The music of Bruckner has long had a special meaning for me. During my childhood in Ghent, Bernard Haitink's Concertgebouw orchestra would come to the cathedral to play two Bruckner symphonies each year. Long before I ever thought of a career in music, I would sit motionless, awestruck by the way this music could fill the entire building, making it shine with sound. And although when I perform Bruckner, I may be using different instruments and interpreting the music in a different way, this is still the effect I am looking for: to fill people's minds and bodies with what are, in a sense, cathedrals in sound, constructed with great abstract blocks of sound and fraught emotion that carry the spirit beyond emotion to something like real freedom. There is no compromise with Bruckner. This is not music for channel-hoppers, or those in search of instant rewards. To deliver his music, you have to be a strong performer - whether you're a conductor like Celibidache or Karajan, or someone with a completely different musical background - like myself. And you also have to be a strong listener.</p> <p>Part of Bruckner's intensity came from his being deeply religious. His Catholicism was the ritualised, obedient religiosity of ordinary people: he said the Ave Maria 16 times each day and never seems to have questioned church teaching. Besides the Bible, his library contained just a few books - Robinson Crusoe seems to have been a particular favourite - and there is no evidence that he read or thought widely about history, literature or art. </p> <p>In some ways, his most devoutly religious work is the second Mass, in E minor. He composed it for the consecration of the votive chapel in the new cathedral at Linz. The church is neo-gothic, part of a wider Austro-Germanic nationalist revival, and Bruckner composed his music for choir and wind ensemble in a manner very different from his other masses, but strongly reminiscent of Lassus and Palestrina. But you don't need to be religious to appreciate the mass, which contains some of Bruckner's gentlest and most easily approachable music, particularly in the Kyrie and the exceptionally delicate Benedictus. The work comes to its fruition in the intense, chromatic polyphony of the Agnus Dei, and even though you can tell how personal this prayer was to Bruckner, even for anti-clerical sceptics like myself, this movement seems to offer something along the lines of real, lasting peace.</p> <p>In performing this music - and particularly the long tradition of what I call spiritual polyphony, which runs from Palestrina and Lassus, through Bach, to Bruckner, Stravinsky and beyond - in letting the music be true to itself, we may also perhaps become truer to ourselves. This, at least, is the kind of authenticity I'm looking for. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Collegium Vocale Gent and Philippe Herreweghe perform Bruckner's Mass in E minor at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on Tuesday. Philippe Herreweghe was talking to Guy Dammann.</p>",
  "<p>Charles Starkweather was a 19-year-old warehouse worker with a James Dean obsession and an unpredictable temper. In the early hours of December 1 1957, Starkweather murdered a gas-station attendant who refused to let him buy a toy puppy on credit. The media christened him the Mad Dog Killer, and within two months, he had shot dead 10 more people, and fled across the midwest with his 14-year-old girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate. The couple was apprehended in February 1958; Fugate sentenced to life, while Starkweather went to the electric chair the following year. </p> <p>Terrence Malick began writing his screenplay Badlands, based on the pair's bloodthirsty road trip, in 1970, when he was 27. The story had already been loosely dramatised in the 1963 film The Sadist, though hardly anyone remembers that one now. Nor do the names Starkweather and Fugate ring too many bells. But time has been kinder to Badlands. Malick's transformation from dazzling young director to enigmatic recluse was never going to harm the reputation of one of the few films he actually got around to finishing. In fact, no film-maker apart from Jean Vigo has attracted such intense reverence with such a slim output. Badlands explains why. It is eloquent about the intersection of crime, romanticism and myth-making in America, and innovative in its use of colour, editing and voiceover. It's also a miracle that this mighty work could have emerged from such an apparently shambolic production.</p> <p>Malick, the son of an oil company executive, came relatively late to film-making. He worked as a philosophy lecturer and journalist before arriving in Los Angeles in autumn 1969 to study at the American Film Institute. \"I'd always liked movies in a kind of naive way,\" he explained in 1975. \"They seemed no less improbable a career than anything else.\" Lanton Mills, the short film he made at the AFI, landed him some lucrative rewriting jobs: he worked on Jack Nicholson's Drive, He Said, and wrote an early draft of Dirty Harry when Marlon Brando was attached to star.</p> <p>Badlands was the first feature he wrote for himself to direct. Executive producer Edward R Pressman raised half the budget, while Malick put in $25,000 of his own and harvested the rest from professionals outside the industry - lawyers, doctors, dentists. \"I developed a kind of sales kit with slides and videotapes of actors, all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot. To my surprise, they didn't pay too much attention to it; they invested on faith.\"</p> <p>Martin Sheen, who was cast as Kit, the nonchalant psychopath based on Starkweather, thought Badlands was the best script he had ever read. \"Still is,\" he told this paper in 1999. \"It was mesmerising. It disarmed you. It was a period piece, and yet of all time. It was extremely American, it caught the spirit of the people, of the culture, in a way that was immediately identifiable.\" Malick, known for his opaque direction, reputedly told the actor on set: \"Think of the gun in your hand as a magic wand.\" Sissy Spacek played Holly, the baton-twirling schoolgirl who elopes with Kit after he kills her father (Warren Oates). And the photo-shy Malick took the small role of an impromptu caller when the actor he had cast failed to show. (\"I prefer working behind the camera,\" he admitted later.)</p> <p>Shooting began in July 1972. The production designer Jack Fisk, who was to work on all Malick's films, was later praised for his Edward Hopper-esque recreations of small-town America. \"Whatever you see in Badlands is Terry's style, not mine,\" he said in 1982. \"He's very strong visually. He was always willing, eager to change to things. He'd see something in the yard and say, 'Let's put that in the bedroom.' That's one thing I learned from him: spontaneity.\"</p> <p>But that impulsiveness came close to wrecking the film. \"The shoot went on for ever because the crew kept quitting,\" Spacek told me in 1999. \"They were completely brutalised. They'd be setting up one shot over here, then Terry would look over in the other direction where the moon was rising up and he'd go, 'Let's shoot over there!' I have these memories of everyone tearing off across the desert in pursuit of one sunset or another.\" Fisk was one of the few who didn't quit. \"I had a vested interest. I'd fallen in love with Sissy, so that also kept me going.\" The couple married two years later.</p> <p>British cinematographer Brian Probyn established the dreamy texture of the picture before being taken ill, exhausted by the heat, the long hours and Malick's idiosyncrasies. \"On several occasions,\" says Pressman, \"I can recall Brian shooting with the slate upside down as a form of protest in a disagreement with Terry about methods of orthodox coverage and matching shots.\" Tak Fujimoto - who later became Jonathan Demme's regular cinematographer - took over after Probyn's depature, until a new director of photography, Steven Larner, was found. \"Amazingly, despite the input of these different hands, the film looks remarkably seamless,\" says Pressman. \"There were three cinematographers, lots of editors, sound men,\" said Fisk. \"Except for the actors, the art department was the only one that completed the film. If the picture survived all those problems, it's because one thing was consistent: Terry Malick's vision.\"</p> <p>There were other setbacks. All the cameras were destroyed during the filming of the morbidly beautiful sequence in which Kit burns down Holly's family home. By the end of the shoot, Malick was $35,000 over budget, forcing him to take on more rewriting assignments before the picture could be edited. But he inspired loyalty among those who stayed the course and kept their sanity. \"People who've worked with Terry either love him or hate him,\" said Spacek. \"I love him. Badlands was a real turning point for me. We'd spend hours talking about things, and then the next day I'd look at the rewrites, and there'd be all the things I told him.\"</p> <p>The film's dislocated emotional effect arises almost entirely from Holly, whose blank-affect narration goes starkly against the grain. Traditionally, a voiceover fills in the gaps for the audience, but Badlands is defined by the contradiction between what we see and what we hear. \"Holly seems at times to think of her narration as like what you get in audio-visual courses in high school,\" explained Malick. \"When they're crossing the badlands, instead of telling us what's going on between Kit and herself, she describes what they ate and what it tasted like, as though we might be planning a similar trip.\"</p> <p>What's more, her blank reaction when Kit guns down her father makes the slaying more shocking than any amount of hysterical identification. \"She isn't indifferent about her father's death,\" Malick pointed out. \"She might have cried buckets of tears, but she wouldn't think of telling you about it. It would not be proper. You should always feel there are large parts of her experience she's not including because she has a strong, if misplaced, sense of propriety.\" This suggestion that we may not be getting the full story is crucial to appreciating Malick, the master of the ellipsis, who is more likely at a moment of high drama to turn his camera on a quivering blade of grass or a bird wriggling in its nest.</p> <p>After a 10-month editing period, Badlands was premiered at the New York film festival on October 13 1973. By all accounts, the reception it received overshadowed even Scorsese's Mean Streets, which played at the same festival. Vincent Canby of the New York Times called Malick's debut \"cool, sometimes brilliant, always ferociously American\". Sheen himself later said: \"I will never be better than I was in Badlands.\" Audiences, however, stayed away. But if ever there was a lesson that box-office success is not synonymous with influence and longevity, Badlands is it.</p> <p>Malick is now in post-production on Tree of Life, starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn - only the fifth feature he has directed in 35 years, following Days of Heaven (1978), The Thin Red Line (1998) and The New World (2005). Back in 1991, when it seemed Malick would never return to cinema, Michael Cimino, director of The Deer Hunter, reflected on the film-maker as though rehearsing an obituary. \"Terry was the one, he was something special,\" Cimino said. \"He had a genuine gift, it wasn't just an eye, it wasn't just a facility with a camera, it wasn't just an ability to write, it was something inside him that was special. He was the greatest director of his time.\" His comments still stand - but in the present tense.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Badlands is rereleased on August 29</p>",
  "<p>Parents face a dilemma when it comes to their children's use of the internet. On the one hand, there are the perceived dangers, whether that means risk of contact with predatory adults operating online, \"cyber bullying\", inadvertent exposure to violent or sexual content or targeting by advertisers. Adults also agonise over the amount of time young people devote to the computer - especially in the age of Facebook, MySpace, Bebo and other online social networks.</p> <p>On the other hand, the internet and associated technologies play an ever-increasing part in learning - at home as well as school. Children need to develop IT literacy - the skills to enable them to operate safely and effectively in order to capitalise on the wealth of knowledge and opportunities offered by the online world. The parent who bans all online activity risks depriving their child of a tool that can enrich their education.</p> <p>Balancing the need for protection with the need for children to develop their IT skills is all the more difficult in an age when even very young children's grasp of new technologies routinely outstrips their parents' understanding.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the government published the Byron report, an in-depth exploration by child psychologist Dr Tanya Byron of the potentially harmful effect of children's use of the internet and video games. Byron, familiar to parents for her TV programmes on child behaviour, pointed out that, while technologies are opening up vast opportunities for young people, their parents' lack of confidence and awareness means they feel ill-equipped to protect and guide their offspring. </p> <h2>Guidance for parents </h2> <p>Byron's recommendations include the creation of a UK council for child internet safety reporting to the prime minister and a one-stop shop on e-safety guidance for parents. Websites, social networks and other businesses targeting young people online will be expected to tighten up their codes of practice, how they control advertising and to improve access to parental control software, making it easier for parents to set computers to limit what their children can look at online. </p> <p>The government has pledged to implement Byron's recommendations in full, but there are already steps parents can take to improve their understanding of IT safety and the online world. </p> <p>The Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre (Ceop), part of the UK police force, targets paedophiles who aim to befriend children online. Its Thinkuknow campaign includes advice for parents and carers aimed at helping them understand what their children do online and how their behaviour might differ from their behaviour in the real world. It explains what terms such as grooming mean in an online context, explains the good and bad sides of social networks and mobile phones, and offers a list of safety tips. </p> <p>Ceop recently launched Hector's World, a new online safety programme for parents with children as young as five. If you think that's too young for children to be fascinated by the internet, note that 59% of 5- to 7-year-olds access the internet at home and that 21% do so unsupervised, according to Ofcom. </p> <p>The charity Childnet International runs a range of projects designed to promote internet safety to young people. Know IT All for Parents, available online or as a CD-rom, is an initiative to help parents get to grips with the internet (and mobile phones) so they can understand how their children use them. It also features a set of activities for parents to do with children to generate discussion about safe online behaviour. </p> <p>For parents who want hands-on help, the government-funded UK Online centres across England are running \"using the internet safely\" courses, giving anyone worried about internet risks a simple introduction to some of the potential pitfalls and how to avoid them. Besides information on helping children to stay safe online, the course includes basic information on computer security and protecting personal data. Those who have internet access already can do the simple course online. Less confident people or those without internet access can go to their nearest UK online centre (they are often based in libraries, community centres or the high street). </p> <p>Internet safety is a hot topic for schools too, of course. Schools have a duty of care towards young people, which means they must take every step possible to ensure students are protected from bullying, violence or other harm - online or otherwise. A school's acceptable use policy (AUP) sets out what they will and won't tolerate in terms of behaviour from pupils (and staff). Certain websites and online services are banned by schools and the local authorities who host schools' internet services. MySpace, the online social network, for example, is off limits in the vast majority of schools. </p> <h2>Where to go for help </h2> <p>If you have any worries about this issue, ask to see your school's AUP and talk to the ICT coordinator, or whoever has responsibility for e-safety on the school's leadership team, about what is being done to ensure children learn to use the online world safely but effectively. </p> <p>Finally, if you are concerned about your child's use of the internet at home, there are a couple of basic rules you can follow. First, talk to your child about what they do online. Ask them to show you their Facebook or MySpace profile, so you can see how it works and what they have posted there, for example. Also, keep the computer in a family area, rather than a child's bedroom, so it's easy for you to monitor. They will be less inclined to behave rashly online if at any moment mum or dad is likely to rear up in the background to look over their shoulder. </p> <h2>Weblinks</h2> <p>Byron review: <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/byronreview\"> dcsf.gov.uk/byronreview</a></p> <p>Ceop's Thinkuknow: <a href=\"http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk \"> thinkuknow.co.uk</a></p> <p>Know IT All for Parents: <a href=\"http://www.childnet-int.org/kia/parents\"> childnet-int.org/kia/parents</a></p> <h2>Explainer: Social networking sites</h2> <p>Online social networks are hugely popular with young people. Some 49% of 8- to 17-year-olds in the UK have an online profile, according to Ofcom. The most popular networks include: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook.com </a>\u2013 probably the best-known site used by teens. Users create their own profile listing their interests, hobbies, friends and favourite music tracks and can post messages. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com\">Myspace.com </a> \u2013 music is the common factor that binds users together here; alongside their profiles, bands and artists have their own pages offering music and short films. Users can decorate their pages to reflect their personalities. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> <a href=\"http://www.bebo.com\">Bebo.com </a>\u2013 bright and breezy site where young people can share minutiae about their lives with lots of music and film recommendations. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Habbo Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.habbo.co.uk\">habbo.co.uk</a>) - virtual hotel where young teenagers can socialise with each other using cartoon figures (avatars) to represent themselves. Users can furnish their Habbo guest rooms with items of virtual furniture and adopt a virtual pet.</p> <p>Sites are moderated, though that doesn't necessarily stop young people circumventing the controls to indulge in inappropriate online behaviour. Lurid photographs and explicit sexual conversations are not the worst of the items posted by youngsters seemingly oblivious that, once on the internet, the material can be shared by millions. </p> <p>In April this year, the Home Office published guidance on social networking. The advice for parents, children and others on how to use the sites in safety was developed by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, the children's charity NSPCC, industry and other charities. The guide can be found at: <a href=\"http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/social-networking-guidance\">police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/social-networking- guidance</a>. </p> <p>Parents who are school governors will also find useful information in the Young People and Social Networking Services report, published by Becta, the government's education technology agency.

  "<p>Almost exactly 11 years ago, in August 1997, Tony Blair visited a classroom at Morpeth school in Bethnal Green, east London, picked up a pen and wrote on the board the key theme of his party conference speech 10 months earlier: \"Education, No 1 priority.\"</p> <p>Three months into the new government, Morpeth was already a success story, though Labour could hardly claim all the credit. In 1994 the school, with around 70% of its intake eligible for free school meals, saw just 11% of its pupils attain five GCSEs at grades A to C; a new management team had helped push that in three years to 39%, described by the then prime minister as a \"fantastic job\".</p> <p>Yesterday marked the latest stage in the school's impressive turnaround, with 69% of students attaining at least five good GCSEs. The percentage achieving that level in subjects including English and maths, the Brown government's new preferred measure of attainment, rose from 47% last year to 53%. In the school canteen, surrounded by beaming staff, nervous students collected their results and glanced at them before shrieking, leaping in the air, and hugging their friends.</p> <p>This is the first generation of GCSE students to be educated exclusively under this government, and at Morpeth at least, Labour's children have been clear beneficiaries of its policies.</p> <p>\"I'm just so, so happy,\" said Jake Stevens, who was celebrating an A* for music, a B for drama, 6 Cs and an E. \"All I needed was 5 Cs to get into college.\" Joynul Khan hadn't slept last night, anxious about getting on to his law course. He needn't have worried, getting 4 A*s and 8 As. \"My dad's really pleased. He started crying when I told him.\"</p> <p>As headteacher for 16 years, Sir Alasdair Macdonald, knighted in the New Year's honours list for services to education, is well placed to grade Labour's own progress in years one to 11 of government. Certainly the signs of the government's investment in education are manifest: a new glass and brick building to replace its \"shocking\" 1970s predecessor, refurbishment of older buildings, and a new theatre and performing arts centre. Next year it will reopen its sixth form, having stopped offering A-levels when the number eligible to sit them, from a school of 1,200, fell to just 17.</p> <p>Education, says Macdonald, never used to be such big news. \"Most of us felt that we were under more public scrutiny in the 1980s, and that increased during the 1990s. But it wasn't until Labour came into power that education and health became the big political issues.</p> <p>\"From my perspective, and this is very much my own perspective, I would say that Labour have lived up to their promises in that. They have put significant amounts of money into education, particularly into areas of the country where there are high levels of disadvantage.\"</p> <p>That funding was spent on buildings and salaries, of course, but also, he says, on making school an attractive place for disaffected young people to come, with subsidised school trips, improved sports facilities, and payments for teachers offering extra revision classes outside school hours. \"We worked out that if we could change the school ethos all the energy that teachers were putting in would be much more productive.\"</p> <p>But if Labour loves Morpeth, Macdonald is not starry-eyed in return. One reason for the school's success, he says, is that it already had momentum when Blair came to power and introduced a blizzard of initiatives.</p> <p>He remains a critical friend, careful to point out that while Morpeth may be a remarkably attractive place to study, \"I could take you to three schools within 10 minutes' walk of here which are not. Some schools are awful.</p> <p>\"If I was to criticise Labour policy, my biggest criticism would be their obsession with individual schools and a competitive model. Because all of our experience shows that if you selectively improve some schools what you do is to move the more difficult students around, but you don't address the underlying issues. If you are serious about having real improvement across the board then you need to recognise that schools function in an ecological way. We are interdependent.</p> <p>He said testing had driven up standards, but \"there comes a point at which you have to say, OK, we have now got a much better system, professionals who are much better at their jobs - let's pull back a bit from it. Let's see perhaps if we can get the same attainment with slightly less of relentless testing throughout their career. But what politician would be brave enough to do that?\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2012 to correct some GCSE results.<br></p>",
  "<p>When Catherine Millet first strutted salaciously onto the world's literary stage, it was as a free-thinking libertarian whose sex life was as indiscriminate as her book proved incendiary. </p> <p>Seven years later the woman who became known as the icon of highbrow erotica is back, but this time as a wife ravaged only by envy and suspicion.</p> <p>With the author's characteristic frankness, Day of Suffering, the first book by Millet since her explosive literary debut The Sexual Life of Catherine M, charts her descent into the psychological \"hell\" of keeping check on her errant husband. </p> <p>It was written in part, she said, as a reality check for her devoted readers who had come to see her way of life as the ultimate in empowered sexual hedonism and regard her as immune from the emotional troubles that beset others.</p> <p>\"Having a very liberated sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and does not protect you from the pain which accompanies it,\" she told French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur.</p> <p>The book, which is released next week, marks a new stage for Millet, the outwardly shy and demure intellectual who edits Art Press, a respected Parisian magazine which she launched in 1972. </p> <p>Since the publication in 2001 of her first book, she has been hailed by some as a feminist revolutionary and denounced by others as a pedlar of nicely written pornography. </p> <p>But for her biggest fans, who continue to deluge her with often explicit letters, she remains the woman who opened up their eyes to a new experience of sex. </p> <p>One of them was an English bus conductor who stumbled upon a copy left on a seat. \"The care and the rigour with which they described to me their sexuality showed that, in a certain way, they wanted to be like me,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Rodney Parker, who has died aged 73, was an archetypal family doctor in Bushey, Herfordshire. In Watford, he helped create one of the first general practitioner training schemes in Britain; he was a mentor to me and many other aspiring GPs. </p> <p>He was immensely shrewd, yet adept at hiding this under the guise of a slightly distracted academic. Through the warmth of his personality, and the relationships he forged with patients, he could constructively present them with uncomfortable truths without offending them. He stopped many people smoking by rummaging in their handbags or pockets and simply confiscating their cigarettes.</p> <p>Rodney qualified as a doctor in Bristol in 1959 and married Jennifer (n\u00e9e Skinner) in the same year. They settled in Bushey, where - during the next four decades - Rodney created and nurtured a seven-partner general practice. The Parker family home was the hub of activities: here prospective partners underwent \"trial by dinner\", and the Parkers hosted an annual garden party for partners and their families.</p> <p>Rodney was an innovator in the team. He pioneered multidisciplinary working before it became fashionable and was instrumental in creating relationships between doctors and social workers and the rest of the team that were so effective that they would be the envy of any GP working today. He was the driving force behind the much-missed Bushey and District hospital, where he also practiced as a surgeon, until it was short-sightedly destroyed.</p> <p>Rodney offered a fine example of how to create a healthy work-life balance. He was a keen fisherman, golfer, tennis player and theatregoer. He created and maintained a huge and magnificent garden. He was an active member of the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers and was also its master. He was an active member of the Bushey community and St James Parish Church. </p> <p>Above all, Rodney was a family man, who nurtured, encouraged and took great pride in the happiness and achievements of Jennifer; his children, Anne and James; his son-in-law Roddy; and his granddaughter, Naomi, who survive him.</p>",
  "<p>American negotiators have not yet succeeded in getting Iraqi officials to agree to keep US troops well into the next president's first term, the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, confirmed yesterday. </p> <p>On a surprise visit to Baghdad, Rice denied earlier reports this week that the two sides had ironed out the last disputes in a heavily contested draft agreement that is due to replace the UN mandate covering the US-led occupation.</p> <p>President George Bush wants the pact to authorise a troop presence at least until 2011 so that he can trumpet it as proof of his policy's success. But the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has adopted the rise in nationalist feeling in the Iraqi parliament and among the public and is insisting on a clear timetable for withdrawal, the lifting of judicial immunity for US troops who commit abuses, and a veto on US military operations, including the arrest of Iraqis.</p> <p>The pact has been downgraded into a \"memorandum of understanding\" to avoid the need for the US Senate to approve it. In Iraq, it has to clear several hurdles. \"Once a breakthrough has really been achieved, the draft will be presented to the council of ministers\", Raid Fahmi Jahid, the science and technology minister told the Guardian yesterday.</p> <p>If the government approves the draft, the parliament will have the last word.</p> <p>The Iraqi side has been pressing for a withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraqi cities by the end of June, and for all troops to leave a year or so later. But after her talks yesterday, Rice said only \"aspirational timetables\" were worth having in the agreement. </p> <p>The Bush administration was angered last month when Maliki gave broad support to Senator Barack Obama's pledge to pull all combat troops out of Iraq by June 2010. This undermined his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, who insisted along with the Bush administration, that withdrawals be linked to achieving various political and security goals, the so-called \"conditions-based approach\" as opposed to \"artificial timetables\".</p> <p>Bush officials also insist that it is the success of the \"surge\" of an extra 30,000 US troops last year which has made talk of a troop reduction possible. </p> <p>Rice's visit yesterday was also aimed at getting Iraqi leaders to agree to a law setting out terms for provincial elections, another Bush benchmark for claiming success.</p>",
  "<p>Debates over whether uniforms stifle creativity are largely a thing of the past: most headteachers believe in the power of a uniform to build ethos and level out inequality. But children grow fast. Over a school lifetime, uniforms will cost parents a substantial amount.</p> <p>Higher-end uniform suppliers are already under pressure from a host of low-cost stores but, as inflation begins to bite, even cheaper suppliers may struggle to keep prices low. There are, however, things parents can do to ease the cost. You can buy early to avoid shortages and crowds, but don't buy more than one size up; in shoes, no more than half a size. Buy second-hand, but not footwear. Damage to feet is worse than the expense of new shoes.</p> <p>Last year supermarket chain Asda offered a complete uniform for less than \u00a310, as did clothing chain Matalan, and bargains can still be found. Asda's girl's Teflon-protected box-pleat skirt sells from \u00a32.50, Matalan's from \u00a33.50. No doubt there are arguments about quality, not to mention ethical considerations. For parents prepared to spend more money, John Lewis has a similar skirt for \u00a314. Whether for financial or ethical reasons, don't forget hand-me-downs and jumble sales. The school's own uniform shop may well be your best bet and you are likely to have to buy ties directly from the school (\u00a33-\u00a36).</p> <p>You will need at least two skirts or pairs of trousers - children fall over and get dirty. Littlewoods' packs for boys or girls are \u00a310. Online School Uniform Shop (<a href=\"http://www.schooluniformshop.co.uk\">schooluniformshop.co.uk</a>) has Trutex skirts and trousers at \u00a37-\u00a314, depending on age and style. Special offers can halve price. Buy at least four non-iron shirts or blouses and five pairs of socks or tights (from \u00a34-\u00a312), to save time in the mornings. Source sweatshirts or pullovers in plain colours from the high street; if a logo is required, you are at the mercy of suppliers charging above \u00a312. Buy a blazer - if needed - where everyone else does. Don't cut corners: your child won't want to stand out. Some blazers can run to \u00a360, though \u00a320-\u00a340 is more usual.</p> <p>Sometimes pupils want to cover up their school colours on the street with a coat. Respect this safety measure. For younger children, Woolworths or Matalan have good ranges from \u00a38; for teenagers there is the disposable option from Primark (\u00a320 up), the classic one from Debenhams (\u00a316-\u00a340), or the pricey option from Snow and Rock (\u00a360).</p> <p>Start-rite and Clarks lead the market in quality footwear, but Marks &amp; Spencer (\u00a314-\u00a327) and Asda have acceptable stock. Stationery is always fun. Fill a pencil case with pens, pencils, geometry sets, glue sticks, erasers, pencil sharpeners at WH Smith, Tesco or Sainsbury's for \u00a312-\u00a320. Make sure school bags can carry a large amount without damaging growing backs. Look in Millets, Blacks or Argos for sports bags and hikers' day packs, from \u00a315 -\u00a330. Really cheap ones tend to disintegrate.</p> <p>Finally, for parents: an alarm clock and a whiteboard to stick on the fridge.</p> <h2>Curriculum: What's new?</h2> <p>Education terminology and developments in England and Wales that parents should be aware of:</p> <p>In England and Wales, education is divided into key stages (KS): early years foundation up to 5 years old; KS1, 5 to 7s; KS2, 7-11s; KS3, 11-14s; KS4, 14-16s; KS5, 16-19s (<a href=\"http://www.teachernet.gov.uk\">teachernet.gov.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong>Assessment for Learning:</strong> Instead of grades, teachers give suggestions for improvement. </p> <p><strong>Loved by:</strong> pupils, teachers </p> <p><strong>Loathed by:</strong> grade-hunters </p> <p><strong>Curriculum changes:</strong> KS3 pupils must study: art and design; citizenship; design and technology; English; geography; history; information and communication technology (ICT); mathematics; modern foreign languages; music; physical education; science; plus religious education, sex education and careers education.

  "<p>Whatever happened to the heroes? The past 20 years have seen a large-scale disappearance of the kind of stars Simon Reynolds once hailed \"freaks, aliens and mad prophets\": the likes of Kevin Rowland, Adam Ant, Gary Numan. In their place we have professional outsiders (plenty of American acts from grunge onwards, British post-punk revivalists by the truckload) and more calculatingly quirky types (Alison Goldfrapp, Arcade Fire). None of these count as cult artists - although they do have rabid followings - because their moves seem so deliberate. Nick Cave's facial hair strikes a similar tone of \"I'm weird, me\", and the same has been true for a raft of serious songwriters from Bonnie Prince Billy to the Beta Band. But Gary Numan's cyber-baldie geek figure - and his unstoppable gob, telling the world every detail of his crumbly life simultaneously shattering and reinforcing his public image - seems like the kind of pop star we're unlikely to see again. No wonder he had an army of Numanoids at his disposal.</p> <p>The alchemy that creates a cult hero is almost lost. With everyone's past and present open to instant scrutiny on the web, it's harder than ever to keep the mystery caged. Out there on the fringes, it's still possible; Bon Iver spent a year in a shed in the middle of Montana and has stirred up something approaching hero status. This touches on the romantic in pop, the genuine outsider, swimming against the tide, and a legend stretching back to Thomas Chatterton, the English Romantic poet who died of arsenic poisoning aged 17. According to Jon Savage's Teenage, Chatterton's story \"sealed the Romantic view of youth as beset by storms and stresses, so much so that premature death - by suicide or accident - was symptomatic.\"</p> <p>Chatterton was commemorated by Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Keats, who \"celebrated him as a misunderstood genius whose youth, made permanent by death, would never fade\". With his pre-Raphaelite locks, whispering vocals, and velvet jacket, Nick Drake was pop's Chatterton, a true doomed Romantic, and his early death created a mythic figure who has since fizzed out of all proportion to his impact on the early 70s rock scene. It has been a gradual process: first, the Dream Academy credited their mid-80s hit Life in a Northern Town to his influence (even though Drake grew up in a Midlands village); in the 1990s, his original records started selling for hundreds of pounds, and a biography appeared. Now, he is as big an oldie as Mr Tambourine Man, his music is heard on BBC trailers, and Brad Pitt - to clinch Drake's Hollywood Babylon status - narrated his brief life story on Radio 2.</p> <p>Some element of tragedy - as with gay icons, though the rockist elite would loathe to admit as much - is key to cult status, and an early death means you never grow ugly. \"Who is the king shag corpse?\" wondered Mark E Smith in 1981. Most likely he had the cult of Ian Curtis on his mind, which, retrospectively, was tiny compared to the Joy Division subculture of 2008, but still big enough to have engulfed the Manchester music scene in greyness until the rise of the Smiths and the Hacienda.</p> <p>Robert Johnson and Hank Williams are still held up by some as the twin bolts of lightning that created rock'n'roll, though only one of them had a song turned into an advert for electrical kitchen appliances: Williams' \"Hey good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?\" was rather more ITV-friendly than \"Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go\", or Dead Shrimp Blues, for that matter. Williams was also popular enough to be among the very first acts to have a 45 released in the UK, I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive being just the 16th release on the MGM label in March 1953. Unfortunately, he had died a couple of months before, making this the first single released as a \"tribute\" to a deceased star.</p> <p>Johnson also unwittingly scored a first, as he died at the mythical age of 27, thus founding what Kurt Cobain's mother referred to as the \"stupid club\" (Jimi, Jim, Janis, Brian and Kurt all signed up later). Johnson is also a perfect example of how someone's legend can distort with history. In 2004, Robert Plant raised a toast on American radio show Fresh Air to \"Robert Johnson, to whom we all owed our existence, in some way.\" Yet during his life, Johnson didn't play many of the dark compositions like Hellhound On My Trail that created his burning myth, but instead played crowd-pleasing hits of the day; he had to earn his cheque, after all. Similarly, the lyric to Cross Road Blues, which Eric Clapton and other myth-builders have claimed is about Johnson selling his soul to the devil in exchange for becoming a blues master (\"Standin' at the crossroads, tried to flag a ride\") sounds to the untrained ear rather more like he's got a flat tyre.</p> <p>Myth is all-important in building up cult status. Why print the truth if the legend is so much more interesting? After all, this is pop music, not the origins of the second world war. The folk world has more than its fair share of cult figures, none greater in recent years than Vashti Bunyan. In 1968, she undertook an expedition from London to the Outer Hebrides by horse and cart. It took her two years and, mid-journey, Joe Boyd convinced her to record a bunch of songs she had written about the experience. Eventually released in 1970, by which time its Aquarian dream and nursery simplicity was out of favour, Just Another Diamond Day sank like a stone. I heard the album in the late 90s and became so obsessed with its innocent beauty that I took a holiday in the Scottish highlands and called up every Bunyan in the phone book, with no joy. Of course, why would this woodland spirit have a telephone?</p> <p>I'd been back from Scotland for about a month when an A&amp;R man at Sanctuary told me he'd been emailed a few times by this Vanished Bunton woman who wanted to reissue her album. He wondered if I'd heard of her. A click of the mouse later, and the legend was revealed: Ms Bunyan lived in the very lovely New Town part of Edinburgh with all mod cons, and - impressively - the rights to her catalogue, which her lawyer partner had helped her to reclaim. Not long after, Just Another Diamond Day was doing good business, outstripping its original sales 20- or 30-fold, and the title track was in an Orange ad. All wonderful for Vashti Bunyan, of course, but her ultra-obscurity was now somewhat diminished.</p> <p>It's essential to keep the mystery caged. Bunyan, mercifully, was still very much alive to appreciate her Indian summer, but Judee Sill was not. She ticks just about every box for a cult hero - sensitive lyrics, singular vision, deviance, a druggie, and she died too young. She looked like a librarian, but had spent time inside for holding up grocery stores, and turned to prostitution to feed her drug habit before she made her first record - on David Geffen's Asylum label - in 1971. It was a a curious blend of Joni Mitchell, religious imagery (Jesus Was a Crossmaker), and country. \"I'm mostly influenced by Pythagoras, Bach and Ray Charles, in that order,\" she told NME. Clips on YouTube show a mousy, disinterested-looking girl in trademark round specs, performing The Kiss, a song in which all of her visions flow together and transcend the singer-songwriter pallet. We don't know much more about her. By the time she died of a heroin overdose, Sill had apparently broken her back twice, she had a pet slow loris, and she had taken a series of female lovers \"to clean my house\". Pure cinema. Sill even had a stereotypical evil stepfather, an animator who allegedly abused her, then tortured other kids by creating the dreadful 1960s Tom and Jerry cartoons.</p> <p>Graham Bond could have walked straight off a Chuck Jones canvas. The bearded, bear-like organist formed his jazz-blues Organization after splitting from Alexis Korner. Other key names to pass through Bond's band were Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and John McLaughlin. \"There is no star and everybody is indispensable,\" Bond told Melody Maker, who described his music as \"loud, hypnotic and neurotic\". Beyond his influence on the blues scene, Bond became obsessed with tarot cards and Aleister Crowley, leading to albums such as Love Is the Law and We Put Our Magick in You. Like all the best cult acts, he makes Zelig-like appearances in That'll Be the Day, with David Essex and Keith Moon, and Joanna Lumley's Swinging London abomination, The Breaking of Bumbo. In and out of prison and psychiatric hospitals during the early 1970s, Bond threw himself under a tube train at Finsbury Park in 1974.</p> <p>Unsubstantiated rumours and unlogged spells in institutions are a thing of the past in an era of microchipped accuracy; with underground legends of the acid rock era - Syd Barrett, Skip Spence, Arthur Lee, Roky Erickson - they are a common occurence. Shindig magazine recently stuck its neck out and plumped for one act as \"the greatest cult band of all time\": the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. Their story defies belief and shifts constantly, taking in all of the classic ingredients before skewing it with musical weirdness, perversion, and a smattering of fabulous, truly psychedelic records. Writer Tim Forster has described the WCPAEB story as a \"fairytale in reverse\".</p> <p>Originally a teen trio of Michael Lloyd and the Harris brothers, Dan and Shaun, they were augmented by an older, wealthy huckster called Bob Markley, who gave them their unwieldy name. (Is it a joke? Is it painfully naive? Who knows?) For Markley, rock'n'roll was the elixir of youth, and an easy way to meet young girls. The band let him join because he could equip them with the best light show in town (which effectively made their name and got them a deal with Reprise), yet according to the other band members, his game plan was skirt-chasing and the music was irrelevent. Though the trio were more than capable, there's no doubt that Markley's cod-poetry and sloganeering gave the band a shamanic quality. His lyrics were obsessed with childhood, fleeting beauty and innocence, and war - he came across like an advertising exec who had studied Jim Morrison and swallowed the hype whole. Eventually, Markley's egomania spiralled into madness. He was severely beaten in Chicago, wrecking his looks, and inherited a fortune only to have it wasted as he vegetated, hospitalised. People aren't even sure if he's still alive. \"I'm not very big on religion,\" says Shaun Harris, \"but if there's such a thing as karma he could be poster boy for it.\"</p> <p>All of these stories follow the classic pop culture rule - never get old and boring. Reading the venomous reviews for the last album by pop's premier archivists Primal Scream, Bobby Gillespie will have understood better than most that his band have outstayed their welcome, and their hero status has been rattled. But if he could go and visit Bob Markley, he probably wouldn't want to swap.</p> <h2>Unknown soldiers - pick of the cult heroes</h2> <p><strong>Edwyn Collins on Vic Godard</strong></p> <p>\"When you mention Vic Godard, everybody still goes 'who'? Only the real cognoscenti know who he is. I first met him when I was stood outside the Lyceum in Edinburgh. He was playing with Subway Sect, along with the Slits and the Jam, but Subway Sect were my favourites. I asked if I could carry his gear in. I didn't meet him again until 1991 or 1992. Geoff Travis put us together, and I produced Vic's album End of the Surrey People. Paul Cook was his drummer by then, and he was a bit cagy, a bit protective. He thought I was taking the piss.\"</p> <p><strong>Gabriella Cilmi on Band of Horses</strong></p> <p>\"I was on the same episode of Later ... as they were, but I missed them because I was too nervous. I heard their album a little while later and loved it - the way they're hairy, rough-looking, middle Americans, but they sing, 'Nobody's gonna love you more ...' They could do well on American country stations, but their sound doesn't really slot in there either. I saw them at Shepherd's Bush Empire - they played three encores, and people went 'shhhh' in the quiet bits. I think that qualifies them as a cult band.\"</p> <p><strong>Barry Hyde (Futureheads) on Alex Chilton</strong></p> <p>\"He is the cult hero's cult hero. Especially for the Big Star albums. The third is his masterpiece. There are no rules on it, none at all. Most albums have some kind of theme, but this is as disjointed as music gets, and somehow it's sublime. He's gone on to influence other cult heroes like the Cocteau Twins and Jeff Buckley. Would I like to meet him? Yeah! We could have a chat over a bottle of white wine. But I'd like to know what kind of mood he'd be in first.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Savage on Skip Spence</strong></p> <p>\"Skip Spence was the drummer for Jefferson Airplane, before he became the singer, guitarist and leading light of Moby Grape. His contributions to their first three albums were marked by a wild logic rare even in those extreme times: just listen to Omaha, Indifference, Motorcycle Irene or Seeing - the last is just like Syd Barrett's Scream Thy Last Scream, being a tone poem of madness and despair. Institutionalised in New York's Bellevue hospital after a violent episode, he travelled to Nashville at the end of 1968 to record his masterpiece, Oar. He looked brilliant: the cover is one of the most iconic pictures of the period. Spence died in 1999, leaving a 90-minute or so legacy of some of the most extreme psychedelic music ever made.\"</p>",

Tickets for this year's festival, held in June, did not sell out until the event got under way. It was the first time the festival had not sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale for years. For the 2009 event at founder Michael Eavis's Worthy Farm, in Pilton, Somerset, revellers will be able to pay a \u00a350 deposit when tickets go on sale on October 5. Eavis said: \"We have come up with a scheme that will allow people a much longer period to plan and pay for their tickets.\" People will be able to register for the event from September 1.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>HRT 'offers older women better sex and sleep'</h2> <p>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could improve sleep and sexuality in older women, and ease joint pain, according to research by Professor Alastair MacLennan, of the University of Adelaide, Australia. The study, of 2,000 women aged 50 to 69, is published by the British Medical Journal on BMJ.com. It concludes: \"Consideration should be given to revisiting HRT guidelines.\" But other experts urged caution. Professor Anne Kavanagh, director of the Key Centre for Women's Health in Society at the University of Melbourne, said: \"The increased risk of serious diseases is now well established.\" <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Katona made bankrupt over unpaid tax bill</h2> <p>Kerry Katona lost a race against time over a tax bill yesterday and was made bankrupt at a high court hearing. The former Atomic Kitten star reduced her \u00a3417,000 tax bill to \u00a382,000 but HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) yesterday insisted on pressing ahead with the bankruptcy petition first issued in January. Mr Registrar Nicholls agreed to make the order after giving 27-year-old Katona a final hour to come up with the balance. Luke Harris, representing Katona who was not in court, asked the registrar to put the matter back, saying funds were available but cheques had not been cleared. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Sex and the City star joins ITV1 Quentin Crisp drama</h2> <p>Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon has joined the cast of ITV1's follow-up to the Quentin Crisp drama The Naked Civil Servant. Nixon - Miranda in Sex and the City - is to play performance artist and playwright Penny Arcade in An Englishman in New York. John Hurt will again play Crisp. Arcade was a close friend of the flamboyant writer and the two created the long-running The Last Will and Testament of Quentin Crisp, in which Arcade semi-interviewed the Englishman on stage. Also in the cast are Denis O'Hare, of the US drama Brothers and Sisters, and Swoosie Kurtz, of Pushing Daisies. <br><strong>Tara Conlan</strong></p> <h2>Silence in court for Fun Lovin' Criminals' gig</h2> <p>A silent disco will be held at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London on September 10, hosted by Fun Lovin' Criminals.

As with other Silent Disco events the sound is amplified 100% through the headphones and not speakers, meaning guitars and vocals won't be audible to the crowd.\" Silent discos have featured at the Glastonbury festival.

The 35-year-old was caught driving at more than five times over the alcohol limit with her five-year-old child in the vehicle. A passerby in Falkirk, central Scotland, called police after seeing the youngster banging on the rear window and hearing shouts of \"stop mummy driving\". The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted two driving offences and a charge of endangering a child following the incident in July. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Elephants proved good at observation and maths</h2> <p>Scientists in Japan say they have demonstrated mathematical ability in elephants. Irie-Sugimoto, of Tokyo university, says the animals can add up and distinguish between only slightly differing quantities. In her study, presented at the International Society for Behavioral Ecology's annual meeting in Ithaca, New York, last week, Irie-Sugimoto said tested elephants were as accurate at telling the difference between five and six, as five and one. Standing by as apples were thrown into two buckets, in random amounts, the attentive Asian elephants picked out the biggest meal of fruit 74% of the time. <br><strong>James Randerson</strong></p> <h2>Law student gets life for murdering his guardian</h2> <p>A law student who stabbed his guardian to death because she pressured him to resit exams he had failed was jailed for life yesterday at Maidstone crown court. David Quartey, 22, was convicted of murdering consultant paediatrician Dr Victoria Anyetei, 54. Jailing him for at least 15 years, Judge Jeremy Carey said: \"You gravely abused the trust that she put in you. It was indeed a frenzied attack of enormous brutality.\" Quartey - whom the judge described as a \"highly dangerous young man\" - stabbed Anyetei 56 times. She was found in her car outside her Dartford, Kent, home last August. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",
  "<p>The most bitter German takeover battle of recent years ended yesterday with an extraordinary deal that sees engineering firm Schaeffler restricted to a minority holding but in effect controlling tyre company Continental.</p> <p>The battle prompted ferocious infighting within the Continental board. It saw the chief executive Manfred Wennemer quit after virulently opposing any deal with privately owned Schaeffler. </p> <p>The deal creates the world's second-largest auto parts-maker after German group Bosch and paves the way for joint development of new powertrain products. Continental, which is based in Hanover, said Schaeffler had increased its bid from \u20ac70.12 a share to \u20ac75 in order to secure the deal, which values it at \u20ac12.1bn (\u00a39.6bn), and had agreed to a maximum stake of 49.99% for four years.</p> <p>J\u00fcrgen Geissinger, Schaeffler's chief executive, who said he had always sought a constructive agreement, said the combined pair \"will deliver innovative solutions for the future challenges facing the auto industry\".</p> <p>The former German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der - an habitue of German boardroom politics - has agreed to act as a \"guarantor for securing the interests of all stakeholders of Continental\", which is code for ensuring that job losses are kept to a minimum. Schr\u00f6der will be empowered to ensure - in or out of the courts - that Schaeffler, owned by Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler and her son Georg, sticks to its obligations. These include retaining Continental as a separate stockmarket-listed company and honouring union agreements as well as paying \u20ac522m compensation in case of change of control.</p> <p>He will also be able to veto any deal Schaeffler reaches with outside investors to take over all or part of its stake, handing a pre-emptive right of purchase to the investor of his choice.</p> <p>Continental has been in the mire since overpaying last year for Siemens's VDO auto components business, which eventually triggered the audacious bid from much smaller Schaeffler, the world's second-largest maker of ball bearings, this summer.</p> <p>Schaeffler will avoid taking on Continental's \u20ac11bn of debt with the deal. It used cash swaps to build up a 36% holding in a controversial move approved yesterday by financial regulator BaFin. Wennemer denounced this \"creeping takeover\" as \"egoistic, high-handed and irresponsible\".</p> <p>Robert Heym, German partner of lawyers Reed Smith, said this allowed Schaeffler to conduct a takeover without paying a premium and it could now win majority votes at shareholder meetings. The group is said to be seeking four seats on the Continental supervisory board.</p>",
  "<p>The late, great BBC athletics commentator Ron Pickering was fond of the phrase \"in every sense of the word\", usually delivering it after a short and meaningful pause. Quite often he would combine it with an adulatory \"this\". \"THIS very much the man, in every sense of the word,\" Pickering would growl as Daley Thompson crushed his arch-rival, J\u00fcrgen Hingsen of West Germany, simply by smirking at him over the long jump pit.</p> <p>I have spent most of my early mornings for the past fortnight in Pickeringesque awe, waking the household at 6am by gazing at Britain's medal tally and intoning loudly: \"And THIS literally fabulous, in every sense of the word.\" Because as a friend of mine observed the other day: \"Every time I see the medal table, I think, bloody hell, so this is what it must feel like to be an Australian.\" </p> <p>As my friend later explained, if it hadn't been for Paula Radcliffe crying in the marathon and Sharron Davies looking scary by the swimming pool he would have thought he had gone insane and was making the whole thing up. In such a time of dizzying changes you need a pillar of certainty to hold on to.</p> <p>Luckily we also have the cycling commentator Hugh Porter, a man you really couldn't make up, even after six double espressos and a large bag of Haribo Tangtastics - not my normal breakfast I assure you, but if you want to compete at this level you have to be prepared to go that extra mile. </p> <p>To the garage, in my case. On Wednesday morning Porter was at his high-tar, gurgling best. \"Oooh, and she's gone down like a real box of tricks,\" he informed the nation as Shanaze Reade tumbled over in the BMX competition. </p> <p>(Isn't the BMX mass-start race fantastic, by the way? It's like watching kids pretending to be on motorbikes. Once or twice I think I've seen some of the competitors twisting the right handlebar grip like it was a throttle, and making revving noises. I bet some of them have stuck an ice-lolly stick in the back wheels so it makes a machine-gun rattle when they go fast, too. It's the best event that has been brought into the Olympics since they introduced snowboarding, which, unsurprisingly, also looks like something invented by children. For 2012, I say we should get some pedal go-karting in there, introduce swinging on a tarzie rope to the men's gymnastics and make the football 38-a-side.)</p> <p>No, what I am compelled by law to call The Great Haul of China is proving deeply disorienting. All our past Olympics have been spent smiling through adversity and \"taking positives\" (though clearly not \"in every sense of the word\") from British performances. \"She's finished 27th,\" we have said, \"but clearly there are a lot of positives she can take forward from that because she is only 32 and with her year-on-year improvement of 0.05 seconds, by the time we get to 2016 she should have a very real chance of threatening to break into the top eight.\"</p> <p>This time around, however, the difficulty has come in taking negatives from things. Brendan Foster made a bold attempt with a tirade about our middle- and long-distance runners on Wednesday evening but Sue Barker was in too bubbly a mood to let him get away with it for long. Like the rest of us, Sue is drunk on gold. For once, finishing second is not good enough. That silver medal in the high jump which was won by a man with his leg held together with gaffer tape would normally have been the cause for street parties. This time he'll be lucky if he gets a smile from his newsagent. </p> <p>But if the performance of Team GB is tough on those who finish second it is even harder on those of us in the columning game. Frankly, one man's Olympic heartbreak is another's 800-word rant on what this latest failure of our so-called sports people tells us about life in Gordon Brown's Britain. Even for the veterans among us it has been a real struggle. Looking on the dark side this Olympics has been a task that even Eeyore would have had trouble with - not that he'd have expected it to be easy, obviously.</p> <p>Luckily we have been able to take refuge in huffy nostalgia. America's Michael Phelps, for instance, has been touted as the greatest-ever Olympian. I am not alone in dismissing the claim with a derisive snort. I think Phelps will only truly have earned that title if at the next Games he does what his illustrious predecessor in the pool, Mark Spitz, did in Munich in 1972 and handicaps himself with a Beach Boys hairdo and the sort of luxurious moustache normally seen taking cover under the flaring nostrils of Lee Van Cleef. </p> <p>Pundits these days are constantly assuring us that victory at the highest level of sport is all about the tiny details. \"It's about hundredths of a second! It's about the tiny details!\" they yelp as the world watches Usain Bolt streak to victory by 10 yards despite the fact that he has only one shoe on and is wearing a sandwich-board advertising cut-price tickets for The Lion King instead of a vest. </p> <p>Bolt, however, is, as David Coleman once said of Michael Johnson, \"a freak in the most positive sense of that word\". For the rest it really is all about minutiae, and in that case you can only wonder how much more Spitz might have achieved if he'd cut his hair and had a proper shave. The exact drag coefficient of that 'tache of his is hard to calculate, but given its square meterage and lush thickness, I estimate that when wet it must have weighed the same as a cocker spaniel. If Phelps really wants to impress us in 2012, let's see him gathering up a fistful of gold medals while swimming with a gun dog sitting on his face. In every sense of the word.</p>",
  "<p>The days of the traditional school report - used by schools for generations to give parents an annual assessment of their child's achievement - are numbered. Instead, today's parents are more likely to log on to their child's school website to receive an up-to-the minute account of what has been happening during the school day. It's also becoming common practice for parents to receive a text message if their child has failed to turn up to school - within minutes of the morning register being taken. </p> <p>New technology is transforming the way that schools and parents communicate with each other. Cardinal Wiseman Catholic technology college (CWCTC) in Birmingham estimates more than 30% of parents regularly log on to to its ePortal to check their child's academic progress. That number is set to increase significantly as it has just provided every pupil in years 7 to 10 with their own personal laptop which will boost computer access, at home and in the classroom. </p> <p>At Nottingham's Djanogly City Academy children have, for the past three years, had access to their own online learning space or eportfolio which means they and their parents can access their school work from anywhere in the world. The academy is also running a pilot project which allows parents to add their own comments about their child's work online - creating an anytime dialogue with their child's teachers. Sanjesh Sharman, the assistant principal at Djanogly, says: \"Parents or pupils can Google and, with a series of [mouse] clicks, open up their school work from any location in the world.\"</p> <p>Parents at Djanogly and CWCTC can also, by logging on to their own passwordprotected site on the schools' websites, find out a range of information about their child - from whether there have been any problems with behaviour during the school day to what homework is being set and if their child is on target to meet their academic predictions.</p> <h2>'Nothing is hidden' </h2> <p>John McGowan, an assistant head at CWCTC who is in charge of the school's ePortal system, says: \"It's a real-time system which has changed the dynamics at school - pupils know that nothing is being hidden from their parents now. The parents love it because they often feel left out about what goes on in school and they don't find out what is happening with their child unless, or until, it's a serious event. \"</p> <p>This allows parents to keep in touch and it means parents now come in much more informed at the annual parent teacher evening which has improved the quality of the consultation.\" </p> <p>Both schools are aware that not all parents have access to a computer or the internet, so they still use more traditional methods of keeping parents informed. </p> <p>The government is keen for all secondary schools in England to follow the example of CWCTC and Djanogly and introduce real time electronic systems for keeping parents informed about their child's school day and academic progress by 2010; the deadline for primary schools is two years later. It also wants schools to adopt eportfolios as part of its national Harnessing Technology strategy. </p> <p>But while the internet may be revolutionising parent's links with schools there are other non-technological ways of keeping in touch. Joining a school's parent teacher association (PTA) is an option which offers a variety of opportunities from accompanying children on school trips, helping in the school library, or listening to young children read. New technology, however, has also changed the way in which PTAs operate which allows more working parents to become involved.</p> <p>Margaret Morrissey from the National Confederation of PTAs says: \"Things have moved on. Although there are meetings, maybe one a term or more if there is a big event coming up, we all communicate with each other by email so if you can't get a babysitter or you're a working parent you can still get involved.\" </p> <h2>Better marks </h2> <p>Parents' active involvement in their child's school may help satisfy their curiosity about what happens in the classroom but does it have any other benefits such as raising a child's academic achievement? Research published in July last year, and originally funded by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), suggests that it does. Researcher Alma Harris, professor of education leadership at the Institute of Education in London who was involved in the DfES study, says: \"Parental engagement did bring significant improvements in achievement, but you have to make the distinction between parental involvement and parental engagement.\"</p> <p>She defines parental involvement as the traditional role adopted by parents through their PTA, while engagement she says is about \"supporting parents in their children's learning - that is what makes the difference in academic achievement.\" </p> <h2>On the web: Resources for parents</h2> <p><strong>ParentsCentre </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www. parentscentre.gov.uk \">Parentscentre.gov.uk</a> is a government-funded website which provides information and support for parents on how to help with your child's learning, including advice on choosing a school and finding childcare.</p> <p><strong>National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ncpta.org.uk \"> ncpta.org.uk </a> is a national charity which represents more than 13,000 PTAs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

  "<p>The return to form of those Ashes fast bowling legends Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison and Simon Jones has dominated the landscape in recent weeks.</p> <p>In the county game, though, there is not a better form fast bowler than Robbie Joseph, 26, whose figures of five for 34 took his championship haul to 40 at 23.85 this season. He certainly deserves a chance with the England Lions.</p> <p>Joseph is scarcely a novelty, since Kent first spotted him 10 years ago. He was born in Antigua but has lived in England since 1997 and made his Kent debut in 2005. This season he has found an extra yard of pace. In fact Kent, with Joseph, Amjad Khan and Yasir Arafat, who is not playing here, have one of the sharpest attacks around at a time when there is little pace in the county game.</p> <p>Here, though, Kent's bowling was flattered by another poor display by the Lancashire batsmen, who were bundled out for only 125 in 36.5 overs. </p> <p>In the morning Kent, who had resumed on 241 for six, made 283 with Geraint Jones scoring his sixth century for the club and his seventh in first-class cricket. He has yet to pass 108, however, and he had made 106 yesterday when he was lbw without playing a stroke. When Lancashire batted, Joseph hit Paul Horton's middle stump, via an inside edge, with the first ball of the innings and in his next over Mal Loye, returning to the side, edged to first slip.</p> <p>After Amjad had Mark Chilton lbw, Lancashire lunched on eight for three, which was even worse than it appeared because their captain, Stuart Law, was having treatment for back spasms and eventually went in at eight. Key did not enforce the follow-on and by the close Kent had extended their lead to 303.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/david-beckham\">David Beckham</a> and Joe Cole have led the calls for patience as fears grow that Fabio Capello is failing to galvanise the same players who under-achieved so miserably under his predecessor, Steve McClaren, as next month's first competitive fixtures of his reign, the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, heave into view.</p> <p>The national side were booed off the pitch as they laboured in a 2-2 draw with the Czech Republic on Wednesday but Capello remained defiantly up-beat afterwards, reacting with incredulity when it was suggested England had appeared off the pace and tactically confused at Wembley and insisting that his charges had played \"without fear and with passion\" for the first time under his stewardship.</p> <p>That assessment was at odds with that of the majority present, though the players have pleaded for expectations not to become over-inflated. \"There are always going to be people who say that we're not progressing as fast as we should be,\" said Beckham. \"People expect progress straight away particularly when a manager of Fabio's quality comes in and with the quality of players we have, but it just doesn't happen like that. It's step by step, it's about bonding together as a team, as a unit, and that takes time.</p> <p>\"We haven't made Wembley our home yet. That's the biggest thing. It feels like when we're going there it's tough. We need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to Wembley. We will get there but it's about getting the confidence up, which will happen in the qualifiers. I'm sure we'll get it right, particularly against Croatia, because of the team-mates I have around me and also because of the manager. He thrives on challenges.\"</p> <p>Cole added: \"It's about qualifying, first and foremost, then we want to be peaking when we get there.</p> <p>\"Far too often I've felt we've peaked in the qualifiers, like a couple of summers ago, but in the cup tournaments we've not really done the business. But we'll be all right. Expectations go up and down. If we'd won 5-0 against the Czechs, people would be talking tomorrow about us being world champions. If we'd have lost 5-0 we'd be the biggest duffers ever to kick a football.</p> <p>\"Patience is the key. Things won't happen overnight. It's an 18-month campaign. Obviously we are making steps, small strides, and they might not be noticeable to the public but we're feeling them as a team and we're getting stronger. This was half a pigeon-step. </p> <p>\"If we qualify winning every game 1-0 with our backs to the wall, we'll take it. But we've got to control our performances and, if we perform well 99 times out of 100, we'll get the right result. I've never known a squad so hungry to get the campaign started.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police patrolling this weekend's Notting Hill carnival will deploy knife scanner arches across the tube network, carry metal detector wands and use special dog units to create a \"hostile environment\" for criminals, a senior Scotland Yard detective said yesterday.</p> <p>Video surveillance officers will also scrutinise live CCTV footage of the annual west London street party to pick out known criminals and troublemakers among a crowd of around 750,000.</p> <p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, who is in charge of policing, said a handful of arrests had already been made during 24 raids in the run-up to this weekend and a number of knives and a gun with ammunition recovered. </p> <p>Police will work alongside Operation Blunt 2, the Met's large ongoing anti-knife drive, while a number of specialist dog units will target those who bring illegal dogs to the carnival to use as weapons.</p> <p>Two hundred new wands have been purchased to be used alongside existing kit by the 5,000 officers due to work at the carnival on Sunday and the 6,000 on Monday. \"We are trying to make the carnival a hostile environment for anyone who wants to go to commit crimes and disorder,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As well as the warrants we've issued we have sent 200 letters to known people advising them not to come to carnival.

  "<p>It was the end of their summer holiday in Madrid and Roberto and Mari\u00e1 Alvarez Carretero were heading home to their parents in Gran Canaria. But when flight JK-5022 swerved off the runway at Barajas airport, their family was shattered for ever.</p> <p>Roberto, six, lived to see his parents, but his sister Mar\u00eda, 16, was not so lucky. \"My six-year-old nephew was saved but we don't know what happened to his sister,\" said their aunt, Virginia Carretero. Roberto and Mar\u00eda sat in seats 6A and 6B. He was hauled from the wreckage, suffering a broken leg, but Mar\u00eda died along with 152 others when the Spanair MD-82 crashed during takeoff and burst into flames.</p> <p>As Spain yesterday tried to come to terms with the worst air tragedy in 25 years, survivors and relatives told of their ordeals.</p> <p>One woman said her husband had been forced to stay on the flight after it first experienced difficulties before takeoff. The unidentified woman told Spanish media her husband texted her almost two hours before the incident saying: \"My love, there's a problem with the plane.\" When she suggested he get off, he said \"They won't let me off.\" It was unclear how urgently he had requested that the crew allow him to disembark.</p> <p>Virginia Carretero kissed her niece and nephew goodbye at Madrid airport as they checked in to fly home to their parents following a week's holiday.</p> <p>After news of the crash emerged, she rushed back to the airport to wait for word of her niece and nephew along with scores of other desperate relatives. Finally, the authorities telephoned. The news was good and bad. \"Roberto is in hospital. They say he is injured but not seriously. He has been sedated and is unconscious. He is alive at least. We don't know anything of his sister,\" said Carretero.</p> <p>Roberto was the youngest of 19 crash survivors, among them three children. Roberto was yesterday recovering in hospital with head and facial injuries.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda Alonso Filloy, 11, had been travelling from Madrid to Gran Canaria with her parents. She survived with a broken</p> <p>leg. Her father, Jos\u00e9 Alonso was said to be in a critical condition with multiple injuries. Her mother, Amalia Filloy Segovia, and her sister, Amalia Alonso, were both killed. Twenty-two children, including two babies, lost their lives.</p> <p>As the investigation into the plane crash continued, other survivors and their relatives were struggling to cope with what had happened. Eight-year-old Alfredo Jes\u00fas Acosta Mendiola was yesterday calling out for his parents. The boy, from Ciudad Real, south of Madrid, was dragged from the wreckage of the burning plane by emergency workers, and suffered only a broken leg. His father, Alfredo Acosta Sierra, died in the crash and his mother, named as G Rodriguez Mendiola, remains in a coma.</p> <p>Ligia Palomino, 41, a doctor who works for the emergency services, was rescued by some of her colleagues. She said as the flight took off she suddenly felt an explosion and saw others die in front of her. \"I grabbed the arm of my partner Jos\u00e9, and looked at Gema, my sister-in-law. Then the plane came to a sharp stop. I heard a horrible noise. I was thrown forward,\" she told El Pa\u00eds newspaper.</p> <p>She was half-conscious when an \"enormous explosion\" woke her and the plane caught fire. \"I reached for Jos\u00e9, put out my hand to touch him. I saw what looked like a doll, which fell on the ground. I realised this person was dead. I knew it wasn't Jos\u00e9.\"</p> <p>Four survivors were in a critical condition, while six others were in a serious condition. Investigators were searching for the remains of two other passengers near the crash site.</p> <p>No Britons have been identified among the victims or survivors but tourists from Sweden, Italy, Germany, France, Brazil, Mauritania, Turkey, Gambia and Indonesia lost their lives in the crash.</p> <p>Government investigators were examining two black boxes for clues as to the causes of the crash. Conclusions may be delayed because one box was damaged.</p> <p>Spanair, which operated the MD-82, revealed that the plane experienced overheating in an air intake valve before a first attempt at takeoff. As the plane was due to take off for the first time, pilot Antonio Garc\u00eda Luna asked for checks to be carried out when a warning light came on.</p> <p>Spanair spokesman, Javier Mendoza, said the device called an air intake probe was reported as overheating in the front of the plane under the cockpit. The spokesman said technicians corrected the problem by turning off the probe which is not on a list of equipment that has to be functional for a plane to take off.</p> <p>Spanair says the plane was eventually cleared by company technicians. It crashed on its second attempt to take off.</p> <p>Anger was mounting yesterday amid suggestions Spanair opted to fly despite detecting problems. \"I'd kill the bastard who did this,\" a driver shouted outside a makeshift morgue. Only 37 of the 153 bodies have been formally identified.</p> <p>Spain has declared three days of mourning. Flags in Madrid flew at half-mast and a silent vigil was held at midday.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday August 25 2008</strong></p> <p> We said in the report below that Spanair had bought the plane involved from Korean Air in 1999. Korean Air would like to make clear that it did not sell the plane to Spanair. It leased the aircraft from a leasing company, returning it in 1998, after which it was acquired by Spanair.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Madrid airport crash may have been caused by a problem with the plane's left engine which sent pieces of metal shooting out, damaging the tail and right engine, sources at the Spanish Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday.</p> <p>Aviation authority sources discounted human error as a cause of the crash in which 153 people died when the Spanair flight swerved off the runway at Madrid's Barajas airport on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"You can only attribute human error when the right emergency procedures have not been followed, which is not what happened here,\" an unnamed source told a Spanish news agency.</p> <p>They said an earlier problem detected in the plane's temperature gauge when it was first due to take off could not have caused the tragedy.</p> <p>Spanair carried out checks when the MD-82 plane experienced overheating in an air intake valve before its original take-off just after 1pm. The device, called an air intake probe, was reported to have been overheating in the front of the plane, under the cockpit.</p> <p>Spanair said technicians corrected the problem by \"de-energising\" - or turning off - the probe. \"The captain of the plane was very scrupulous,\" said the air authority sources. \"This was not a serious problem. With this you can fly.\"</p> <p>Aviation authority sources said the pilot probably took off, then the engine failed.</p> <p>\"The passengers probably heard a noise, just like a can rattling with something inside,\" the source said.</p> <p>They said that at this point, the captain would have tried to correct the plane, but the engine problem caused damage to the plane's tail, sending it veering out of control.</p> <p>Photographs of the crashed plane show damage to the tail which could have been caused by objects being shot out of the left engine, suggested the source.</p> <p>The plane which crashed was reported to have had recent technical issues.</p> <p>Javier Fernandez Garcia, the flight coordinator at Madrid airport, told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo: \"This aircraft already had two flights cancelled because of problems.\"</p> <p>The plane was 15 years old, bought by Spanair from Korean Air in 1999, and was overhauled in January.</p> <p>The MD-82 should be able to lift off with only one engine. Pilots are trained for such eventualities.</p>",
  "<p>Saturday February 9 1957. Britain is shocked by the news that a runaway goods train in Derbyshire, the 11.05am from Buxton to Arpley, has ploughed into the back of the 8.45 from Rowsley to Edgley. When the grim details of the disaster emerge, they touch the nation even more keenly: a supply pipe fractured, filling the driver's cab with scalding steam so fierce he couldn't get near the controls. The driver, a 57-year-old Stockport man called John Axon, ordered the fireman Ron Scanlon to jump to safety, but as the train hurtled downhill towards Chapel-en-le-Frith, Axon himself clung to the boiling footplate to warn the Doves Hole signalman to clear the track and try to avert tragedy. He failed, and both Axon and Alfred Ball, a guard on the Rowsley freight train, died in the appalling mangle of metal that followed.</p> <p>Axon was posthumously awarded the George Cross for bravery, but the event was to have an even more resounding cultural significance, indirectly changing the direction of British radio and giving context and mainstream currency to the then-infant underground folk music revival. Charles Parker, a tall, devoutly religious, slightly eccentric, red-bearded wartime submarine commander and Cambridge history graduate turned BBC producer, was commissioned to make a radio documentary about the tragedy. He enlisted the help of Ewan MacColl, the radical playwright, songwriter and singer, who in turn engaged his much younger lover, the 22-year-old American banjo player and singer Peggy Seeger.</p> <p>The subsequent 45-minute programme, The Ballad of John Axon, originally broadcast 50 years ago, caused a sensation. Even now, the subject of a new book and the inspiration for a Moby-esque dance record stirring up interest on Radio 1, it continues to fascinate and capture imaginations.</p> <p>Inspired in part by an Earl Robinson programme for CBS in the US about Abraham Lincoln's funeral train, using music interspersed with first-person accounts, it broke all the usual BBC conventions. At a time when practically all broadcast material was delivered in plummy Home Counties accents, the Parker/MacColl/Seeger strategy of using working-class voices and \"actuality\" recordings of Axon's widow and co-workers rather than trained actors horrified some of the big cheeses at the BBC. Though he had his own reservations about MacColl's approach, Parker fought a constant rearguard battle against internal opposition - George Camacho, head of the BBC's Light Programme, described it as \"technique run riot\" - to retain the dominant Lancashire dialect and get the show to air at all. MacColl sifted through 40 hours of recordings, and Parker spent two months breaking into the BBC's Broad Street studios at dead of night putting it all together because there simply wasn't enough time in the day. Further recordings were made with many of the leading folk luminaries of the day - Isla Cameron, Bert Lloyd and Alf Edwards among them - performing MacColl's accompanying music, arranged and orchestrated by a \"green round the ears\" Peggy Seeger.</p> <p>Its impact was immediate. It was acclaimed by the press and public alike, including a ringing endorsement from the Axon family and the rail workers; Hugh Carleton Greene, director general of the BBC, called it \"the most brilliantly executed and the most moving radio programme I've ever heard\". Over the next six years, Parker, MacColl and Seeger put together seven more Radio Ballads following a similar format, covering the building of the M1, the fishing industry, coal mining, polio victims, teenagers, boxing and Travellers, each one now ingrained in the very fabric of the folk-music revival and featuring many of MacColl's most brilliant songs. </p> <p>Yet, nothing came easy. Preparations for the second in the series, Song of a Road, were plagued by a tortuous love triangle. With no work permit, Seeger had been deported from the UK and was living in France, pregnant with MacColl's child, a situation further complicated by the fact that MacColl's second wife, Jean, was also pregnant by him. In emotional turmoil, Ewan persuaded the ebullient Scottish singer Alex Campbell to step into the breach and marry Peggy, purely so she could become a British citizen and get back into the UK. She returned in time to give birth to their son Neill (now himself a fine guitarist), and Jean MacColl gave birth to a daughter, Kirsty, a couple of months later. Ewan and Peggy eventually married, and their personal and musical partnership prevailed until his death in 1989.</p> <p>The Radio Ballads were first issued on CD by Topic in 1999, and Peggy remains justly proud of them. \"Ewan wrote the scripts and had most of the ideas, which were so revolutionary at the time that even Charles Parker fought them. When they transcribed the recordings, Charles wanted to give them to actors, but Ewan said no, the material was too strong. You couldn't give the voice of John Axon's wife to an actor. Charles didn't believe it, and the actuality was put in against his better wishes.\"</p> <p>In 2006, the BBC updated the Radio Ballads concept with a whole new range of subjects (including steel, hunting, Aids and Northern Ireland), broadcast on Radio 2 with John Tams in the MacColl role. Meanwhile, Peter Cox's newly published book Set Into Song gives a searching insight into the often fraught background to the Ballads, the practical problems involved in dragging their large tape machines into railway yards, on to fishing boats and down coal mines, and the discovery that many of the recordings were made at different speeds.</p> <p>Most surprising, however, is the emergence of the Radio Ballads at the heart of a new dance record, Primary Transmissions, by Broadcaster, which contrives not only to put a completely different slant on the Ballad stories but somehow manages to make Ewan MacColl sound like Elvis in A Little Less Conversation mode. There's speculation that the record could do for the English tradition what Moby's Play did for Alan Lomax's American field recordings. Strongly redolent of Fatboy Slim, the opening track, England, draws heavily on The Ballad of John Axon, and has been championed by Radio 1's Colin Murray as his record of the week. It still came as a shock, however, to find Peggy Seeger, who now lives in Boston, enthusiastically promoting Primary Transmissions and selling it at gigs on her recent UK tour. \"I love it,\" she says. \"It's great to hear the music done in that way.\"</p> <p>Broadcaster, the DJ responsible, is Lewis Atkinson, a 40-year-old ex-indie rock musician with a penchant for mashing up spoken-word samples into beats. He went to work on the John Axon story after his ex-girlfriend Kitty MacColl - Ewan and Peggy's daughter - gave him a copy of the Radio Ballads as a birthday present. It took him five years to make the album, mainly due to the difficulties in getting BBC permission to use the samples. \"I'd virtually given up - I didn't think it would ever happen,\" he says. \"But we've had a fantastic reaction, and I haven't had any death threats from outraged hardcore folkies. Well, not yet anyway.\"</p> <p>The family connection is further emphasised by the fact that Primary Transmission is co-produced by Ewan and Peggy's second son, Calum MacColl, who, when not collaborating on songs with Ronan Keating and touring as Boyzone's musical director, also co-runs the Red Grape label that has released it. \"I'm Charles Parker to Lewis Atkinson's Ewan MacColl,\" says Calum cheerily. \"When you grow up with something, you take it for granted. I was always aware of the Radio Ballads, but I'd never thought of them as being this great, groundbreaking thing. My dad and I used to fight anyway about politics. Not that I'd ever have voted Tory, but you have to rebel, don't you? But I like the way Lewis has put it into a narrative with a modern context and an overall flavour. It's not just a case of taking a flat-capped northern voice and putting beats behind it. He's made something completely new out of it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Primary Transmission by Broadcaster is out now on Red Grape.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>We have brought you tales of turmoil within the far right. Today it's sad tidings of finger-pointing and unkindness within the National Union of Students, where senior officials have pledged to investigate complaints of strange behaviour at an \"active political training course\" staged last week at York University. A statement compiled by the NUS Black Students' section tells how one officer allegedly warned workshop participants against increasing black representation in the fictional university created for training purposes, as \"the presence of such students would increase gun and knife crime and so require more security\". Another officer, according to the complainants, \"thought it would be funny to hold up a poster saying BRING BACK SLAVERY!\". Members of the union's national executive committee were present, it is said, though none objected or intervened. Add this to the allegation from last term, when a student was informed that \"her brother's name was 'too foreign-sounding' to be used in promotional materials\" - a fact since acknowledged by the union - and it is fairly easy to see why Wes Streeting, the NUS national president, is seeking to clear the air with an investigation. \"We do not tolerate racism or a failure to deal with it,\" he says. And we shall see.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Trying times in Banglatown - Britain's curry capital - where the well known are wondering who might be next to face calamity. The talk is of Azmal Hussain, the Brick Lane \"curry king\", who was one of George Galloway's most prominent local backers and the chair of Tower Hamlets Respect. This week he was arrested for alleged common assault and witness intimidation. Shiraj Haque, a player in the local Labour party, is wondering why, of all the curry houses in all the towns in all the world, the BBC selected Haque's famously named establishment - Clifton - for an undercover expos\u00e9, which alleged unhealthy practices in the kitchen. And this might also be meat and drink to favoured local TV stations such as Channel S, were it not for the fact that one of the channel's former bigwigs has recently been convicted of insurance fraud. Rival Bangla TV can't easily gloat either, because one of its execs is also facing some tricky legal difficulties. These are unrelated to the station itself. Nevertheless they earned him pride of place on the rival channel's main news bulletin. Nothing is proven, let us say. All may yet emerge without a stain on their characters. But if folk are treading warily down there, it's hardly surprising.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Can we just say that when we Google Harriet Harman (Labour MP for Camberwell &amp; Peckham, leader of the House of Commons, lord privy seal and minister for women and equality) or Hazel Blears (Labour MP for Salford, secretary of state for communities and local government), we do not expect to see at the very top of the page that foolishly mocked-up poster depicting a scantily-clad Hazel - along with the other one-time aspirants to the deputy leadership of the Labour party and the headline \"Attack of the 50-inch woman\". It may be, as we suspect, the work of Google-bombers - pesky types who subvert search processes for their own ends - but now that we have enjoyed our own cheap laugh we think it should stop. End of story.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>If it is true that we only have a short time to save the planet, how can the sole piece of wisdom available from Tory Green Initiative website be: \"Sorry, but you are looking for something that isn't here.\" Where's the leadership? Where's the urgency?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>And finally, from a contributor to the Pink News website, an appreciation of the work of the late Leo Abse. The Daily Mail says he was \"a very dangerous dandy\". But overall we kind of liked him. \"It takes the action of individuals to get the ball rolling and achieve the set goals by popular demand and the united voice,\" it says. \"Though his achievements were off target and did not achieve the desired Ethiopia of Equality, it established a starting point from which one could move forward.\" We agree and we note too the Oceania of grief occasioned by his passing. We shall not see his like again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>MI5 participated in the unlawful interrogation of a British resident now held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the high court found yesterday in a judgment raising serious questions about the conduct of Britain's security and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>One MI5 officer was so concerned about incriminating himself that he initially declined to answer questions from the judges even in private, the judgment reveals. Though the judges say \"no adverse conclusions\" should be drawn by the MI5 officer's plea against self-incrimination, they disclose that the officer, Witness B, was questioned about alleged war crimes under the international criminal court act, including torture. The full evidence surrounding Witness B's evidence, and the judges' findings, remain secret.</p> <p>The MI5 officer interrogated the British resident, Binyam Mohamed, while he was being held in Pakistan in 2002. Mohamed, 30, an Ethiopian national, was later secretly rendered to Morocco, where he says was tortured by having his penis cut with a razor blade. The US subsequently flew him to Afghanistan and he was transferred to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in September 2004 where he remains.</p> <p>In a passage which appears to contradict previous assurances by MI5, Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones concluded: \"The conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the United States when [Mohamed] was being detained by the United States incommunicado and without access to a lawyer.\" They added: \"Under the law of Pakistan, that detention was unlawful.\"</p> <p>Asked last month about unrelated allegations involving detainees held in Pakistan, the Home Office said on behalf of MI5: \"All security service staff have an awareness of the Human Rights Act 1998, and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the UK and overseas.\"</p> <p>It added that the security and intelligence agencies \"do not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment\".</p> <p>In their ruling yesterday, the judges found that MI5 \"continued to facilitate\" the interviewing of Mohamed at the behest of the US even after he was secretly flown out of Pakistan. It did so, they said, by providing information to America although its officers \"must also have appreciated\" he was being detained and questioned in a facility which was \"that of a foreign government\". That government is believed to be Morocco.</p> <p>The judgment contains two particularly stinging passages. The judges said Witness B worked with the US \"to the extent of making it clear to [Mohamed] that the United Kingdom government would not help [him] unless he cooperated fully with the United States authorities\". They added: \"The relationship of the United Kingdom government to the United States authorities in connection with [Mohamed] was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing.\"</p> <p>Mohamed is due to be tried for terrorist offences before a US military commission in Guant\u00e1namo Bay as a result of confessions he says were extracted by torture. He faces the death penalty if found guilty. Without information held by the British government, he could not have a fair trial \"as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions - namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment\", the judges said.</p> <p>Richard Stein, of Leigh Day, Mohamed's lawyer, said outside the court that the government was clearly committed to a fair trial and opposed to the practices of torture and extraordinary rendition. He added: \"However, unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the Americans, it waivers in this commitment\".</p> <p>David Miliband, the foreign secretary, has provided the US with documents about the case, though the US has so far refused to release them. Miliband has declined to release further evidence about the case on grounds of national security, arguing that disclosure would harm Britain's intelligence relationship with the US.</p> <p>The judges will decide which documents about the case must be released after a private court hearing next week.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said the implications of the judgment were being considered very carefully. He added: \"For strong reasons of national security, to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight, we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily.\" </p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, director of Reprieve, the legal rights group also defending Mohamed, said: \"The British government may have been accused of being Bush's poodle, but the British courts remain bulldogs when it comes to human rights.\"</p> <p>Senior security sources said last night that the judgment was being carefully looked at to see whether changes should be made in MI5's procedures. </p> <p>They added that the court recognised that Mohamed in 2002 was regarded as someone potentially significant. \"Talking to people who could provide life-saving intelligence is MI5's bread and butter,\" they said.</p>",
  "<p>Lorraine Kelly exists in a category of fame occupied not exclusively but predominantly by women who are celebrated for, above all, being nice. Like Barbara Windsor or Felicity Kendall, the presenter often attracts the accolade of \"national treasure\", and you will commonly hear her name deployed as cultural shorthand for a particular type of modern daytime television. Four mornings a week, she fills the final half hour of GMTV with a show called LK Today - a low-calorie cocktail of celebrity interviews, fashion tips, health items and human-interest stories, blended for a viewing demographic comprised chiefly of housewives.</p> <p>The discrepancy between some presenters' professional geniality and off-air personality is a perennial favourite of the tabloid gossip columns. What everyone always says about Kelly, however, is that the woman we see on the studio sofa is identical to the one in real life. It would appear to be absolutely true. She greets me in the GMTV offices with unselfconscious warmth, bustles me into her dressing room trailing giggly apologies for the mess, and blethers away generously for well over an hour. Kelly confounds all her industry's egomaniac cliches, and is impossible to dislike; according to one survey, she is the celebrity most people would like to buy a car from. And yet by the time I leave, I'm so wound up I have to go and sit by the Thames.</p> <p>Kelly has just written an autobiography, which she hopes will show people how hard she has worked to get where she is. Now aged 48 and one of the longest-serving faces of morning TV, she has been with GMTV since its launch in 1993. She grew up in working-class Glasgow, joined her local paper straight from school, then worked briefly for BBC Scotland, before becoming TV-am's Scottish correspondent in 1984. In 1989 she was invited down to London to cover for an absent studio presenter for a week - and never went back. </p> <p>I ask if she credits her working-class Glaswegian background with her instinct for the studio sofa's chatty confidences. \"I think that's got a lot to do with it,\" she agrees. \"Hopefully I can talk to people. But I don't get intimidated by people. I think, growing up, I learned that. You know, you can talk to absolutely anybody, no matter where they come from.\"</p> <p>She can certainly talk. Kelly bubbles with enthusiasm for everything, from how brilliant London looked on The Apprentice, to how easy it is to commute from Dundee since she and her husband, a cameraman, and their 14-year-old daughter moved back to Scotland in 2006. What is hard is to get her to stop for long enough to actually think about anything - or follow the logic of it through. </p> <p>Does she think, I try, that television today is recruiting enough people with her sort of background? \"Ooh. I don't know that it is. That's really interesting, I've never really thought about that properly. I don't know that it does. Because people like me tend to go into newspapers.\" She looks dismayed when I tell her that Fleet Street's recruitment is becoming increasingly selective, favouring middle-class applicants who can afford to begin their career as unpaid interns. </p> <p>\"Ooooh! Really? The Chrisabels are taking over! Oh no no no no no! Oh, we don't like that.\" Would she say TV was, by contrast, a meritocratic industry? \"I don't know. It's something I haven't really thought about.\" </p> <p>Now that she considers it, Kelly reflects cautiously, \"There's that thing of an awful lot of people coming through now, where it's all about looks and style and no substance. And yes, lovely-looking people - but can they ask the questions, can they actually ask the killer question? Because I find a lot of people on TV, naming no names, they're very self-absorbed.</p> <p>\"I think with me, I was lucky, because my boss at TV-am was a real newspaper man, and what he wanted on the sofa was a terrier. He wanted somebody who could do the job without being threatening, but who could still have the credentials, because I'd had all those years out doing Piper Alpha and Lockerbie and prison riots, and always got my story. Always, always, always. I'd go to the end of the earth to get my story. If a day went by and I wasn't on the bulletins, that was a failure. I had to have something on every day, and I worked my arse off, I really did.\"</p> <p>She invokes her frontline credentials a lot. \"I could not do this job without all that experience. Of course, one minute I'm talking about flowery fashion or whatever. But then in your ear you will hear there has been a train crash, or a bombing, or something. And instantly you have to go,\" - she claps her hands - \"'right', and you go into that mode, and that's your job, that's what you do.\" </p> <p>When Kelly talks about the \"flowery\" side of her job, her voice goes instantly girlish and giggly. \"I mean, it's fantastic to get to go and talk to George Clooney!\" But she'd never planned on becoming a daytime presenter. \"Oh no no no no no no, not at all!\" she exclaims, as if such an ambition would be almost shameful. Yet she's not embarrassed about having been an ambitious young reporter, and seems to derive her greatest professional self-esteem from current affairs. What I can't understand, therefore, is why she would want to trade it in for celebrity gossip and the latest catwalk trends.</p> <p>\"Well,\" she says brightly, \"see, to me news is news. And it doesn't matter whether you're talking about the scandal of what's happening in Zimbabwe, or you're doing something about the latest Hollywood blockbuster. It's still news. Very different - but it's still news.\"</p> <p>Is it? The idea that all media output is essentially the same is certainly popular. It's been gaining traction ever since the 90s, when a postmodern fashion began for placing Spielberg blockbusters in the same critical category as Shakespeare. But the conceit of equivalence has more or less disqualified any value judgment between the content of, say, war reporting and OK! magazine - and seems to legitimise an idea that it's fine to hold a series of opinions which all contradict each other.</p> <p>Between her two weekly tabloid newspaper columns, Kelly must write nearly 100 opinion dispatches a year. \"I'm damn sure if something's annoying me, it's annoying everybody else,\" she says - and she's probably right. But listening to her hold forth feels like overhearing the random opinions of young women on a Saturday morning in a beauty salon waiting room. It's a modern version of femininity which is lively, and affects the appearance of an opinionated mind. But it doesn't seem to recognise that taking one position should have to preclude a contradictory view a second later.</p> <p>I ask if she's ever wondered whether it's ideal for people to begin their day by sitting in front of the telly. \"I know what you mean, it's a guilty pleasure!\" she exclaims. \"It's that kind of naughtiness, isn't it, watching telly in the morning?\" So it doesn't trouble her? \"Oh no, because it's a great way of communicating and informing.\" </p> <p>She agrees that morning television has changed dramatically during her career, with the advent of shows such as Jeremy Kyle's, which engineer shouting matches between unhappy people for entertainment. \"I don't like those kind of shows at all,\" she shudders. \"Not my cup of tea, don't like those shows. And you know,\" she goes on, \"I've been dipping in and out of Big Brother, and I found it absolutely horrendous. I found it really just people screaming and shouting at one another. I found it quite upsetting. I think we've definitely crossed a line.\"</p> <p>Yet she sees no problem with disapproving of entertainment which trades on cruelty while still buying it. \"Heat magazine really makes me laugh. I love Circle of Shame!\" Circle of Shame is a photographic feature that circles and zooms in on any tiny aesthetic imperfection. \"It's just hilariously funny. I always feel so sorry for those people who spend hours and hours getting ready - and then they've got a funny toe! It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous! It's just crazy,\" she chuckles, \"it's daft.\"</p> <p>There is still loads of great stuff on TV, she enthuses. \"I love television! I'm a TV addict. Love it love it love it love it love it. Absolutely love it.\" How much does she watch? \"Oh, far too much!\" she exclaims - so I ask if she ever worries about people watching too much TV. \"There's a bit too much hand-wringing about that, I think,\" she says. \"It depends what you're watching.\" But what she and her daughter love to watch together is America's Next Top Model.</p> <p>\"I know, it's fluffy and mad and completely bubble-headed. Don't care! It's so ridiculous, but I watch it and say I would love Miss Jay to come on my show and teach me how to walk in high heels. I love him! It's such funny, daft, great telly. It really is well, well done. I mean, rubbish can be great when it's well done. It's good.\"</p> <p>Yet moments later, Kelly holds forth about the tyranny of the media's imperative to be thin, and how it affects young girls growing up. \"I've always been very careful to say that as a mother, we have a huge responsibility to our children, we must not be on diets, or counting calories, or jumping on and off scales saying, 'Does my arse look big in this?' It's wrong wrong wrong. It drives me mad. I find it insane that we live in a society where women diet themselves to look like seven-year-old boys, and then have to buy themselves breasts. It's insane, don't you think? I mean, what are we really doing? What are we doing? It's just madness. </p> <p>\"And I find this whole thing of celebrities having their babies by elective caesarean and having a tummy tuck at the same time really very damaging. I just think it's just, oooh, it makes other women feel inadequate and that's not right. It's really bad that women feel they've got to look like that.\" </p> <p>When I mention Elizabeth Hurley famously doing a swimsuit shoot within weeks of giving birth, Kelly interrupts in a funny posh voice: \"I ate a banana! Three raisins and a banana.\" She hoots at the craziness of it. But Hurley, I say, pointed out at the time that being thin was basically her job. \"Well it's a daft job,\" snorts Kelly. \"But then,\" she adds, \"having said that, I suppose you've got to take your hat off to somebody who lives off two raisins and a banana. Although it is mad. It is mad.\"</p> <p>Why would you take off your hat to something you consider mad? The second-most searched-for subject on GMTV's website is \"weight loss\", and Kelly agrees that the particular pressure on women who work in television is a serious problem. \"But,\" she adds, \"not once has anybody ever said to me this is what you have to wear or how you have to look.\" Kelly has run two London marathons and made two fitness DVDs. Does she mean she would look exactly as she does if she didn't work on TV? \"If I didn't work on television,\" she giggles, \"I'd be gigantic probably!\"</p> <p>Kelly is a sensible, smart woman. I think that's why I wind up feeling angry - because her show dripfeeds directly into the very same culture she describes as \"mad\", affecting to deride it while still lapping it up, as if a presenter who has a \"down-to-earth laugh\" about it somehow exonerates everyone from any complicity. Kelly would have Hurley on her show modelling swimwear in a flash. Has she no misgivings at all, I try one last time, about dedicating her career to that culture?</p> <p>\"Oh well, I know exactly what you mean. But I hope I'm the little voice in the wilderness, saying this is mad.</p> <p>\"You know,\" she giggles, \"I always remember when we were doing the whole thing about Paris Hilton coming out of jail. And we were buying into it, because we were covering it as well. And I always remember saying to our correspondent, do you know what I would love is if all you guys put your cameras on the ground when she came out, and all the paparazzi did as well. Wouldn't it be great? Wouldn't that be fabulous?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lorraine: Between You and Me is published by Headline Review priced 18.99</p>",
  "<p>Band break-ups can be famously acrimonious, those involving siblings particularly so. Yet when brothers David and Peter Brewis called time on their Sunderland-based trio Field Music in June 2007, it didn't involve a Gallagheresque punch-up. Instead, ignoring the fact that their album Tones of Town had just been hailed in some quarters as one of the best of last year, they simply announced that Field Music were on hiatus. And, leaving behind two albums of taut, artful and critically lauded indiepop, plus a B-sides and rarities compilation, they quietly embarked on solo albums. </p> <p>The strange thing is that each brother has continued to be involved in the other's subsequent projects. When I meet the pair, Peter has come down to London not to promote his own forthcoming solo record, as The Week That Was, but to play bass for David, in his School of Language guise. Which is all very nice, of course. Yet since each brother was responsible for his own songs within Field Music, it also brings up an obvious question: if they weren't going to change the way they worked, why on earth didn't they just carry on as Field Music? </p> <p>\"We just wanted to do something else,\" says David, shrugging, sitting outside a pub sipping that most rock'n'roll of afternoon drinks: a nice cup of tea. \"It was like, wait a second, being in a band's rubbish! What, you make a record and then tour for two years? And the best reaction you can get is 2,000 people going, 'Yeah, I know this song.' That's not what I find satisfying about music.\"</p> <p>The obligation to keep playing the same set is only one explanation for their decision to stop Field Music - or at least, transform it from a group into a vague conceptual umbrella that, as Peter puts it, encompasses \"whatever the hell we do\". Over the course of our interview, the brothers will also say that they were wary of being musically typecast; that they didn't feel the band was financially viable; that doing the album justice as a mere trio was too technically challenging to be enjoyable; that Field Music was meant to be a method of making music rather than a band; that if they had continued, they would have \"stabbed each other to death\". </p> <p>Matt Jacob of Memphis Industries, the independent label that's home to Field Music as well as both The Week That Was and School of Language, says he still doesn't quite understand himself why the Brewises stopped working under the Field Music guise. But he refuses to mark it down as an attempt at career suicide. </p> <p>\"They weren't trying to sabotage their own success,\" he says. \"They weren't even thinking about success in the first place.\" He goes on: \"They really don't give a shit about selling records at all. I know it's a cliche, but it really is all about the music.\" </p> <p>Oh really? The Brewises say that they are, on the contrary, \"very bothered\" about record sales. Indeed, they take a surprising interest in their own finances, even staying in youth hostels after gigs. Yet this is down to their belief that financial debt means ceding artistic control. However much they mind if they fail to sell any records, they wouldn't attempt to change that by, say, embarking on an arena tour with Snow Patrol - something that, as Field Music, they famously declined. Not for nothing does the School of Language MySpace site bear the tagline: \"Commercially hostile since 1999\".</p> <p>Indeed, if Field Music have failed to replicate the commercial success of two other Sunderland bands, Max\u00efmo Park and the Futureheads, it is largely their own doing. Matt Jacob says he has a hunch that watching these two bands become pigeonholed by their own success is one of the reasons behind Field Music's \"no sell-out\" attitude. </p> <p>As Peter says of the Futureheads, with whom he once played drums: \"When they did that second album, which is radically different from the first one, it was like, 'This hasn't got [their breakthrough cover version of] Hounds of Love on any more, so they're not very good.' I mean, I love the album. It sounds great.\" The brothers resist being classed alongside them, however, as some less imaginative critics have done. David adds: \"I love being associated with the Futureheads, they're my mates. But when you start to see reviews where it's like, 'Shiny happy popsters from Sunderland, Field Music,' I think, what? Who? Us?\" </p> <p>David says that across the Atlantic, he has noticed a difference when he performs as School of Language. \"The people who are into Field Music in America are the most ardent anglophiles. It's like, 'I love Field Music, I love the Kooks, I love the Kaiser Chiefs, I just love all those guys.'\" At this point, he lets his head drop into his hands in despair. \"But now [with School of Language], it's like, 'I love [avant jazz combo] Chicago Underground Duo and I love [post-rock act] Tortoise and yeah, the School of Language album is pretty cool.' It's very different.\" </p> <p>The flip side, of course, is that in shedding the Field Music name, they have also lost a good deal of their audience. I ask whether School of Language sales are down compared with Field Music and David bursts out laughing, with an emphatic: \"Oh yes, Jesus.\" </p> <p>Early signs are that things are looking slightly better for Peter's The Week That Was, a glorious record inspired by a week without TV, a diet of Paul Auster novels and experimental 80s pop: Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Tin Drum-era Japan. But even so, it's unlikely to get close to the figures achieved even by Tones of Town - which didn't even do as well as it might have done, since the band announced they were splitting shortly after. </p> <p>As they prepare to head off to the School of Language gig, I ask the brothers whether they won't tire of their new guises just as fast. David points out that they can simply think up new names (and they may need to at this rate). Peter confirms that The Week That Was is probably a one-album project, while the third Field Music member, keyboardist Andrew Moore, is apparently also embarking on a solo project as John Monroe. </p> <p>Then they drop the bombshell. Having apparently ditched a promising career as Field Music for a multi-moniker setup that almost requires a Venn diagram to explain, they now consider it \"absolutely\" possible that they'll do another Field Music album. It's a statement that makes sense only if seen through Field Music's unique internal logic, where the claim that the art comes first is more than mere rhetoric. </p> <p>\"We realised quite a long time ago: let's not fight to get on the front cover of the NME,\" explains David, in conclusion. \"If we just keep making things of quality, maybe they'll take 20 years, but people will find us. And if that means there's never any huge breakthrough, then so be it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Week That Was and School of Language are out now on Memphis Industries. The Week That Was play on August 14 at The Deaf Institute, Manchester, with School of Language, then tour.</p>",
  "<p>Spirited, funny and with a delightful transposition from the graphic novels, Persepolis deftly combines the personal and the political as the history of a feisty Iranian from childhood to adulthood takes place with a background that includes a revolution and a war. The basic style is simple, like an animated woodcut; it is highly effective and the black and white suits the country's latterday austerity. Co-directed by the author, Marjane Satrapi, the film has a lot of ground to cover, but never feels rushed and anyone expecting damnation of her homeland will find no supporting evidence in a refreshingly unmessagey piece.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardianoffers.co.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/GuardianOffers/_nmpwmx25/%2D/DVD%3A-Persepolis\">Order this DVD</a> from the Guardian</p>",
  "<p>Next month, I will have a speaking role in a monumental movie. My scene will be filmed in the sumptuous lounge of the five-star Hotel du Palais in Biarritz. Built as a palace for Princess Eugenie in the 19th century, the hotel is a perfect setting for the film, a transposition of Marcel Proust's epic seven-volume novel A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. However, before anyone feels envy or wants to borrow some money, I must stress that I will be among a cast of some 3,000 volunteers from 246 countries who will each read one page of the book. The movie will be 170 hours long. </p> <p>Veronique Aubouy, who conceived the whole project (titled Le Baiser de la Matrice), has already filmed 77 hours of sequential readings from the novel, shown non-stop (nights included) at the La Rochelle International film festival a few weeks ago. They are anonymous readers, in places chosen by themselves - an apartment, the beach, a park, a caf\u00e9, in a train etc - each reading from A la Recherche while facing the camera before fading to black as the next person takes over. In all, Aubouy has filmed 742 people since 1993, and yet only three volumes have been completed. </p> <p>A foolhardy and pointless enterprise or, indeed, le temps perdu? Far from it. There is an extremely inviting and intriguing element about this film-fleuve. Something interesting grips one in almost every image - whether it's the background, the looks of the reader and the manner in which they read - some divinely, some haltingly, some dramatically, some incomprehensibly. Amusing and moving at times, the film puts the work in perspective, and reveals something about the reader. </p> <p>In a way, this could be considered the most successful attempt to film Proust's novel of time, space and memory, a landmark in 20th-century literature. Previous films have been bleeding chunks by directors having only dared tackle one volume such as Volker Schlondorff's Swann in Love (1984), Raul Ruiz's Time Regained (1999) and Chantal Akerman's The Captive (2000). Various others have tried to bring the whole novel to the screen, only to end in tears. </p> <p>The involved history of unrealised films of the novel needs a long book in itself. After former actor and producer Nicole St\u00e9phane, who had acquired the screen rights in 1962, approached Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, he explained in a letter to a friend: \"I wrote to the woman producer that no real film-maker would allow himself to squeeze the madeleine as though it were a lemon.\" Her efforts to get Alain Resnais and Jacques Rivette came to nothing; nor did Joseph Losey's attempt (though the 1972 script by Harold Pinter has been published). Losey tried for years to get finance only to be told by one Hollywood bigwig, \"This is the age of Gene Hackman and Barbra Streisand. There are no roles for them here.\" </p> <p>The closest it came was with Luchino Visconti, that most Proustian of directors. Eight months were spent writing the script (363 pages long), and another six weeks were spent on scouting for locations. In all, the film was to last four hours and cost an astronomical 5bn lire, but when St\u00e9phane balked at the price and asked to be given more time to raise the money, Visconti, haughtily and discourteously abandoned the film. Could Aubouy's project be the definitive film version? </p> <p>Incidentally, it is still open for anyone who fancies themselves a Proustian and who wants to take part in this historic literary and cinematic enterprise. Starting at noon GMT on September 27, I will be among a multitude of people from all over the world, some in the night, some in the day, in front of their web cameras, who will be seen live on the internet. I'm not yet sure which page I'll be reading, and no matter how hard I try to sound French, I know that my English accent will come through. But it won't matter unduly; Aubouy is looking for a multiplicity of accents to lend Proust even more universality.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lebaiserdelamatrice.fr\">lebaiserdelamatrice.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>For the past 60 days or so, since about the end of June, the people of Kashmir have been free. Free in the most profound sense. They have shrugged off the terror of living their lives in the gun-sights of half a million heavily armed soldiers, in the most densely militarised zone in the world. </p> <p>After 18 years of administering a military occupation, the Indian government's worst nightmare has come true. Having declared that the militant movement has been crushed, it is now faced with a non-violent mass protest, but not the kind it knows how to manage. This one is nourished by people's memory of years of repression in which tens of thousands have been killed, thousands have been \"disappeared\", hundreds of thousands tortured, injured, and humiliated. That kind of rage, once it finds utterance, cannot easily be tamed, rebottled and sent back to where it came from. </p> <p>A sudden twist of fate, an ill-conceived move over the transfer of 100 acres of state forest land to the Amarnath Shrine Board (which manages the annual Hindu pilgrimage to a cave deep in the Kashmir Himalayas) suddenly became the equivalent of tossing a lit match into a barrel of petrol. Until 1989 the Amarnath pilgrimage used to attract about 20,000 people who travelled to the Amarnath cave over a period of about two weeks. In 1990, when the overtly Islamist militant uprising in the valley coincided with the spread of virulent Hindu nationalism (Hindutva) in the Indian plains, the number of pilgrims began to increase exponentially. By 2008 more than 500,000 pilgrims visited the Amarnath cave, in large groups, their passage often sponsored by Indian business houses. To many people in the valley this dramatic increase in numbers was seen as an aggressive political statement by an increasingly Hindu-fundamentalist Indian state. Rightly or wrongly, the land transfer was viewed as the thin edge of the wedge. It triggered an apprehension that it was the beginning of an elaborate plan to build Israeli-style settlements, and change the demography of the valley. </p> <p>Days of massive protest forced the valley to shut down completely. Within hours the protests spread from the cities to villages. Young stone pelters took to the streets and faced armed police who fired straight at them, killing several. For people as well as the government, it resurrected memories of the uprising in the early 90s. Throughout the weeks of protest, hartal (strikes) and police firing, while the Hindutva publicity machine charged Kashmiris with committing every kind of communal excess, the 500,000 Amarnath pilgrims completed their pilgrimage, not just unhurt, but touched by the hospitality they had been shown by local people.</p> <p>Eventually, taken completely by surprise at the ferocity of the response, the government revoked the land transfer. But by then the land-transfer had become what Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the most senior and also the most overtly Islamist separatist leader, called a \"non-issue\". </p> <p>Massive protests against the revocation erupted in Jammu. There, too, the issue snowballed into something much bigger. Hindus began to raise issues of neglect and discrimination by the Indian state. (For some odd reason they blamed Kashmiris for that neglect.) The protests led to the blockading of the Jammu-Srinagar highway, the only functional road-link between Kashmir and India. Truckloads of perishable fresh fruit and valley produce began to rot. </p> <p>The blockade demonstrated in no uncertain terms to people in Kashmir that they lived on sufferance, and that if they didn't behave themselves they could be put under siege, starved, deprived of essential commodities and medical supplies. </p> <p>To expect matters to end there was of course absurd. Hadn't anybody noticed that in Kashmir even minor protests about civic issues like water and electricity inevitably turned into demands for azadi, freedom? To threaten them with mass starvation amounted to committing political suicide. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the voice that the government of India has tried so hard to silence in Kashmir has massed into a deafening roar. Raised in a playground of army camps, checkpoints, and bunkers, with screams from torture chambers for a soundtrack, the young generation has suddenly discovered the power of mass protest, and above all, the dignity of being able to straighten their shoulders and speak for themselves, represent themselves. For them it is nothing short of an epiphany. Not even the fear of death seems to hold them back. And once that fear has gone, of what use is the largest or second largest army in the world? </p> <p>There have been mass rallies in the past, but none in recent memory that have been so sustained and widespread. The mainstream political parties of Kashmir - National Conference and People's Democratic party - appear dutifully for debates in New Delhi's TV studios, but can't muster the courage to appear on the streets of Kashmir. The armed militants who, through the worst years of repression were seen as the only ones carrying the torch of azadi forward, if they are around at all, seem content to take a back seat and let people do the fighting for a change. </p> <p>The separatist leaders who do appear and speak at the rallies are not leaders so much as followers, being guided by the phenomenal spontaneous energy of a caged, enraged people that has exploded on Kashmir's streets. Day after day, hundreds of thousands of people swarm around places that hold terrible memories for them. They demolish bunkers, break through cordons of concertina wire and stare straight down the barrels of soldiers' machine guns, saying what very few in India want to hear. Hum Kya Chahtey? Azadi! (We want freedom.) And, it has to be said, in equal numbers and with equal intensity: Jeevey jeevey Pakistan. (Long live Pakistan.)</p> <p>That sound reverberates through the valley like the drumbeat of steady rain on a tin roof, like the roll of thunder during an electric storm. </p> <p>On August 15, India's independence day, Lal Chowk, the nerve centre of Srinagar, was taken over by thousands of people who hoisted the Pakistani flag and wished each other \"happy belated independence day\" (Pakistan celebrates independence on August 14) and \"happy slavery day\". Humour obviously, has survived India's many torture centres and Abu Ghraibs in Kashmir.</p> <p>On August 16 more than 300,000 people marched to Pampore, to the village of the Hurriyat leader, Sheikh Abdul Aziz, who was shot down in cold blood five days earlier. </p> <p>On the night of August 17 the police sealed the city. Streets were barricaded, thousands of armed police manned the barriers. The roads leading into Srinagar were blocked. On the morning of August 18, people began pouring into Srinagar from villages and towns across the valley. In trucks, tempos, jeeps, buses and on foot. Once again, barriers were broken and people reclaimed their city. The police were faced with a choice of either stepping aside or executing a massacre. They stepped aside. Not a single bullet was fired.</p> <p>The city floated on a sea of smiles. There was ecstasy in the air. Everyone had a banner; houseboat owners, traders, students, lawyers, doctors. One said: \"We are all prisoners, set us free.\" Another said: \"Democracy without freedom is demon-crazy.\" Demon-crazy. That was a good one. Perhaps he was referring to the insanity that permits the world's largest democracy to administer the world's largest military occupation and continue to call itself a democracy.</p> <p>There was a green flag on every lamp post, every roof, every bus stop and on the top of chinar trees. A big one fluttered outside the All India Radio building. Road signs were painted over. Rawalpindi they said. Or simply Pakistan. It would be a mistake to assume that the public expression of affection for Pakistan automatically translates into a desire to accede to Pakistan. Some of it has to do with gratitude for the support - cynical or otherwise - for what Kashmiris see as their freedom struggle, and the Indian state sees as a terrorist campaign. It also has to do with mischief. With saying and doing what galls India most of all. (It's easy to scoff at the idea of a \"freedom struggle\" that wishes to distance itself from a country that is supposed to be a democracy and align itself with another that has, for the most part been ruled by military dictators. A country whose army has committed genocide in what is now Bangladesh. A country that is even now being torn apart by its own ethnic war. These are important questions, but right now perhaps it's more useful to wonder what this so-called democracy did in Kashmir to make people hate it so?)</p> <p>Everywhere there were Pakistani flags, everywhere the cry Pakistan se rishta kya? La illaha illallah. (What is our bond with Pakistan? There is no god but Allah.) Azadi ka matlab kya? La illaha illallah. (What does freedom mean? There is no god but Allah.)</p> <p>For somebody like myself, who is not Muslim, that interpretation of freedom is hard - if not impossible - to understand. I asked a young woman whether freedom for Kashmir would not mean less freedom for her, as a woman. She shrugged and said \"What kind of freedom do we have now? The freedom to be raped by Indian soldiers?\" Her reply silenced me.</p> <p>Surrounded by a sea of green flags, it was impossible to doubt or ignore the deeply Islamic fervour of the uprising taking place around me. It was equally impossible to label it a vicious, terrorist jihad. For Kashmiris it was a catharsis. A historical moment in a long and complicated struggle for freedom with all the imperfections, cruelties and confusions that freedom struggles have. This one cannot by any means call itself pristine, and will always be stigmatised by, and will some day, I hope, have to account for, among other things, the brutal killings of Kashmiri Pandits in the early years of the uprising, culminating in the exodus of almost the entire Hindu community from the Kashmir valley. </p> <p>As the crowd continued to swell I listened carefully to the slogans, because rhetoric often holds the key to all kinds of understanding. There were plenty of insults and humiliation for India: Ay jabiron ay zalimon, Kashmir hamara chhod do (Oh oppressors, Oh wicked ones, Get out of our Kashmir.) The slogan that cut through me like a knife and clean broke my heart was this one: Nanga bhookha Hindustan, jaan se pyaara Pakistan. (Naked, starving India, More precious than life itself - Pakistan.) </p> <p>Why was it so galling, so painful to listen to this? I tried to work it out and settled on three reasons. First, because we all know that the first part of the slogan is the embarrassing and unadorned truth about India, the emerging superpower. Second, because all Indians who are not nanga or bhooka are and have been complicit in complex and historical ways with the elaborate cultural and economic systems that make Indian society so cruel, so vulgarly unequal. And third, because it was painful to listen to people who have suffered so much themselves mock others who suffer, in different ways, but no less intensely, under the same oppressor. In that slogan I saw the seeds of how easily victims can become perpetrators.</p> <p>Syed Ali Shah Geelani began his address with a recitation from the Qur'an. He then said what he has said before, on hundreds of occasions. The only way for the struggle to succeed, he said, was to turn to the Qur'an for guidance. He said Islam would guide the struggle and that it was a complete social and moral code that would govern the people of a free Kashmir. He said Pakistan had been created as the home of Islam, and that that goal should never be subverted. He said just as Pakistan belonged to Kashmir, Kashmir belonged to Pakistan. He said minority communities would have full rights and their places of worship would be safe. Each point he made was applauded. </p> <p>I imagined myself standing in the heart of a Hindu nationalist rally being addressed by the Bharatiya Janata party's (BJP) LK Advani. Replace the word Islam with the word Hindutva, replace the word Pakistan with Hindustan, replace the green flags with saffron ones and we would have the BJP's nightmare vision of an ideal India. </p> <p>Is that what we should accept as our future? Monolithic religious states handing down a complete social and moral code, \"a complete way of life\"? Millions of us in India reject the Hindutva project. Our rejection springs from love, from passion, from a kind of idealism, from having enormous emotional stakes in the society in which we live. What our neighbours do, how they choose to handle their affairs does not affect our argument, it only strengthens it. </p> <p>Arguments that spring from love are also fraught with danger. It is for the people of Kashmir to agree or disagree with the Islamist project (which is as contested, in equally complex ways, all over the world by Muslims, as Hindutva is contested by Hindus). Perhaps now that the threat of violence has receded and there is some space in which to debate views and air ideas, it is time for those who are part of the struggle to outline a vision for what kind of society they are fighting for. Perhaps it is time to offer people something more than martyrs, slogans and vague generalisations. Those who wish to turn to the Qur'an for guidance will no doubt find guidance there. But what of those who do not wish to do that, or for whom the Qur'an does not make place? Do the Hindus of Jammu and other minorities also have the right to self-determination? Will the hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits living in exile, many of them in terrible poverty, have the right to return? Will they be paid reparations for the terrible losses they have suffered? Or will a free Kashmir do to its minorities what India has done to Kashmiris for 61 years? What will happen to homosexuals and adulterers and blasphemers? What of thieves and lafangas and writers who do not agree with the \"complete social and moral code\"? Will we be put to death as we are in Saudi Arabia? Will the cycle of death, repression and bloodshed continue? History offers many models for Kashmir's thinkers and intellectuals and politicians to study. What will the Kashmir of their dreams look like? Algeria? Iran? South Africa? Switzerland? Pakistan? </p> <p>At a crucial time like this, few things are more important than dreams. A lazy utopia and a flawed sense of justice will have consequences that do not bear thinking about. This is not the time for intellectual sloth or a reluctance to assess a situation clearly and honestly. </p> <p>Already the spectre of partition has reared its head. Hindutva networks are alive with rumours about Hindus in the valley being attacked and forced to flee. In response, phone calls from Jammu reported that an armed Hindu militia was threatening a massacre and that Muslims from the two Hindu majority districts were preparing to flee. Memories of the bloodbath that ensued and claimed the lives of more than a million people when India and Pakistan were partitioned have come flooding back. That nightmare will haunt all of us forever.</p> <p>However, none of these fears of what the future holds can justify the continued military occupation of a nation and a people. No more than the old colonial argument about how the natives were not ready for freedom justified the colonial project.</p> <p>Of course there are many ways for the Indian state to continue to hold on to Kashmir. It could do what it does best. Wait. And hope the people's energy will dissipate in the absence of a concrete plan. It could try and fracture the fragile coalition that is emerging. It could extinguish this non-violent uprising and re-invite armed militancy. It could increase the number of troops from half a million to a whole million. A few strategic massacres, a couple of targeted assassinations, some disappearances and a massive round of arrests should do the trick for a few more years. </p> <p>The unimaginable sums of public money that are needed to keep the military occupation of Kashmir going is money that ought by right to be spent on schools and hospitals and food for an impoverished, malnutritioned population in India. What kind of government can possibly believe that it has the right to spend it on more weapons, more concertina wire and more prisons in Kashmir?</p> <p>The Indian military occupation of Kashmir makes monsters of us all. It allows Hindu chauvinists to target and victimise Muslims in India by holding them hostage to the freedom struggle being waged by Muslims in Kashmir. </p> <p>India needs azadi from Kashmir just as much as - if not more than - Kashmir needs azadi from India.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Arundhati Roy, 2008.

  "<p>Given the bleak economic and security situation in Pakistan, it is easy to forget that 2008 has also been a year of positive events for the country. February's elections proved that it is possible to hold free and fair polls in Pakistan, that in such circumstances undemocratic leaders such as Musharraf and his allies will be trounced, and (yet again) that the notion of broad public support for the parties of the religious right is a myth.</p> <p>In the subsequent six months, the electorate has demonstrated another quality: patience. Despite sky-high inflation and crippling power shortages, Pakistan has not witnessed the sort of destabilising mass protests that history has shown Pakistanis to be capable of. Rather, frustrated though they are, people are prepared to wait. Seemingly by popular consensus, the democratic setup is being given time to find its feet.</p> <p>Similarly, the resignation of President Musharraf is not only a sign of politicians implementing a core demand of their constituents but also a remarkable departure from the past. Consider how the country's first three dictators left power: Ayub Khan passed the baton to his successor as army chief; Yahya Khan departed after a catastrophic military defeat; Zia-ul-Haq died in a suspicious air crash. But Musharraf has given way to an elected government after being told firmly, yet with considerable restraint, that he must go or face the constitutional process of impeachment.</p> <p>The volatility of Pakistan's history makes me cautious of claiming that something fundamental has changed, but I suspect it may have. Last year, images of Pakistani lawyers in suits clashing with staff-wielding police officers made the newspapers for good reason. It is significant that in a country where those in power (soldiers, tribal chiefs, bureaucrats, landlords, the wealthy) have traditionally mistreated the weak with impunity, the demand for the rule of law has gained mass support.</p> <p>So popular has this cause become that even now, almost a year after Musharraf dismissed independent-minded members of the higher judiciary, politicians cannot wriggle free of expectations for their restoration. In my memory, this is perhaps Pakistan's first example of a secular, issue-based special interest group succeeding in setting the country's political agenda by winning over the electorate and creating a vote bank that politicians know they must take seriously. It is, in other words, a rousing example of democracy in action.</p> <p>None of this would have been possible without the power of television. When I grew up, in the 1980s, public space in Pakistan was virtually nonexistent: political thugs controlled most university campuses; protest rallies were violently disrupted; being a journalist was a dangerous profession; theatre and dance were discouraged; and legal and informal rules erected hurdles to young women and men congregating together. The country's attention was kept fragmented - except for communication from the state, which exploited its monopoly on text books, radio, and television for purposes of propaganda.</p> <p>Musharraf (although he tried unsuccessfully to undo it in the end) opened up television to private ownership and allowed channels to operate freely. The impact on Pakistan cannot be overestimated. News programmes, talk shows, sitcoms, music videos, religious exegesis, cooking and fashion suddenly filled the nation's screens. A giant public space was created, and viewers flocked to it. Television has given Pakistan a truly open national forum for the first time in its history. Ideas are debated, leaders are assessed and criticised, and a nation of 170 million people is finally discovering, together, what it thinks.</p> <p>Where this will lead is difficult to predict, especially as squabbling among the country's politicians or the action of outside powers could easily derail Pakistan's promising experiment with democracy. But if this does not happen, it is likely that Pakistan will continue to become more aware of, and more responsive to, the will of its own people.</p> <p>This is no small development. The will of the people is not always a guide to what is morally right. But it is at least a guide to self-interest. And Pakistan has acted with remarkable frequency against its evident self-interest since its foundation. Failing to spend on education and health? Ignoring a chronic shortage of clean drinking water? Accepting near-universal tax evasion by the rich? Opening the borders to heroin and weapons? Whatever one's politics, it is hard to believe that these are the policies most Pakistanis believe to be in their self-interest - but these are what, until now, they have accepted.</p> <p>The world seems concerned with Pakistan primarily as an actor in global attempts to combat terrorism. As a democracy, Pakistan's role in this drama is likely to change because a great tension at the centre of the US-Pakistan alliance will increasingly be exposed. That tension, in a nutshell, is this: most Pakistanis are anti-America. For a combination of reasons, and despite evident fondness for American products and individuals, my impression is that most Pakistanis have extremely negative views of the US as a geopolitical player.</p> <p>Building an alliance on such a foundation has been difficult. In the absence of highly unlikely reversals of US positions on a whole range of international issues, Pakistan's democracy and the power of the country's new national electronic forum will make maintaining the US-Pakistan alliance trickier still. Pakistani politicians may attempt to avoid the problem by hypocritically asserting one thing to America and another to the Pakistani people. But Musharraf has already discovered that Pakistanis are becoming aware of such double-speak and finding it repugnant.</p> <p>The anti-America sentiment suggests that Pakistanis would like greater independence in their relationship with the US. But the moribund state of Pakistan's economy and the fraught nature of its security situation make the country utterly dependent on US aid and eager for hi-tech American weaponry. The challenge facing Pakistan's new leaders is to explain that Pakistanis cannot have both. If they are to satisfy their constituents, they will need to articulate a plan for increasingly putting Pakistan's interests first while gradually reducing the country's reliance on the US.</p> <p>The US, for its part, will need to adjust to a Pakistan in which anti-America sentiment could seriously undermine US interests. The US can best do this by offering Pakistan not the appearance of an alliance but the equality and mutual respect that constitutes the substance of one. Pakistan's people have already demonstrated through the ballot that they reject the Taliban worldview, and the number of Pakistanis who died in terrorist attacks last year alone exceeds the number of Americans killed on 9/11. Pakistan should be allowed to determine how best to fight extremists on its soil. Pakistani solutions are likely to be slower and more cautious than US ones, but also, crucially, more sustained and popular, and therefore more effective in the long run.</p> <p>It is by no means clear whether the US can be convinced to accept Pakistan's lead, especially as the implications for Afghanistan of doing so seem to clash with the muscular, foreign occupation-style approach being advocated by both US presidential candidates. Nor is it clear whether Pakistan's politicians can develop a strategy for delivering what voters want while addressing America's (and the powerful Pakistani military's) concerns. But democracy was never going to be easy. One can only hope that this time Pakistan's experiment with it will be allowed to succeed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mohsin Hamid is the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mohsinhamid.com\">www.mohsinhamid.com</a></p>",
  "<p>If there is a Labour party leadership election this autumn, Dick Cheney and John McCain have their candidate. Step forward David Miliband, neoconservative. The foreign secretary's aggressive posturing on the side of Washington over the Ossetian crisis has made it abundantly clear where he stands on the great divide in world politics today. He is for the US empire.</p> <p>This is bad news for those Labour party supporters who correctly believe that the party's troubles cannot be overcome without ending its witless support for US foreign policy and the calamities it is causing, of which the continuing Iraq war is the most lurid exhibit.</p> <p>There was a flutter of hope during his momentary honeymoon period last summer that Gordon Brown would make the change the party and the public wanted - he muttered about pulling troops out of Iraq and looked a study in sulkiness when visiting George Bush.</p> <p>All huff and puff, as it turned out. At least Miliband has made a point of puncturing any similar illusions in advance. His now famous manifesto in the Guardian parroted the standard Washington line on Iraq to the effect that the only problem was the failure of the invaders to prepare for the peace as well as the war, a proposition that even Donald Rumsfeld and Christopher Hitchens may by now agree with. But it is in relation to the Russia-Georgia crisis that he has most clearly broken cover.</p> <p>Mikheil Saakashvili's role in igniting the conflict is ignored or downplayed. Russia should be punished. Nato must expand headlong. The view of the peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia that they do not wish to be Georgian must be ignored. Above all, the part played by US global expansionism in provoking the crisis must go unexamined.</p> <p>Miliband has put Britain back in the centre of almost exactly the same \"coalition of the willing\" as rallied behind the Iraq infamy - Washington, London and \"new Europe\". The main difference is that this time Italy and Spain have joined France and Germany on the side of caution, leaving the British government even more isolated.</p> <p>And even more hypocritical. For Miliband to insist - as he did in an article in the Times this week - that Russia must respect international law, displays a breathtaking lack of self-awareness. Pre-Iraq, support for the UN and international legality were cornerstones of Labour's stated approach to world politics. Tony Blair put paid to that and here we are half a million or so corpses later.</p> <p>You can't play cop and robber at the same time on the world stage, just as you can't offer Labour a fresh start while clinging doggedly to the most disastrous policy of the last 11 years. Deputy chief whip Nick Brown appears to have got the message with a remarkable article on Comment is Free this week, trashing the Miliband line and Georgia's Nato aspirations.</p> <p>Perhaps he has noticed that the foreign secretary is not only echoing George Bush's approach to the Georgian crisis but even David Cameron's, whose brief flirtation with less subservience to Washington seems to have gone by the board. Indeed, Miliband seems irked that Cameron got to Tbilisi first to deliver a Russophobic rant - the Tory leader's pledge to bar Russians from Selfridges marks the only point of difference. Miliband apparently stands firm on the right to shop, come what may.</p> <p>Of course, the collateral damage done to the foreign secretary's prime ministerial pretensions is surely the least of the tragedies of the unnecessary war in the Caucasus. But it does leave an opening for any politician who can articulate the public desire for a foreign policy more independent of the US, before imperial Washington drags us into conflicts which may make even the immense suffering of Iraq seem like an appetiser.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andrew Murray is chair of the Stop the War Coalition<br><a href=\"mailto:office@stopwar.org.uk\">office@stopwar.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Gary Glitter has been moving around so much - 19 countries have so far said they will refuse him entry - that I don't know where he will be by the time you read this. But he is now said to have reluctantly agreed to get on a plane to London, where he will fall into the arms of up to 35 police officers who have been waiting patiently at Heathrow for his return. That's a lot of police officers deployed at great expense to greet one miserable, perverted, played-out old rock star, but it's proportionate to the hysteria provoked by Glitter's release from a Vietnamese prison, where he served two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for committing \"obscene acts\" with two little girls; and it's in line with the seriousness with which the British government is taking the matter.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, has even framed a new law to make sure that this \"despicable person\", as she has publicly called him, will never travel abroad again. If he gets to London, the police will make him sign the sex offenders' register and thereafter monitor his movements. Glitter has become an international pariah with no family and no friends (apart perhaps from a few other paedophiles) and will spend the foreseeable future under constant surveillance both from the police and, still more irksomely, from the media, which will give him no peace. He may well decide that life in a Vietnamese prison was better.</p> <p>One doesn't have to underrate the threat that Glitter may still pose to children, or to find him anything other than repulsive with his ghastly, self-righteous grin, to find this a disturbing state of affairs. For Glitter has a point when he protests, \"I've done my time. I'm a free man\" - or, rather, he would have a point if he had committed any other kind of crime, such as maiming or killing someone. In such a circumstance, he would, indeed, be a free man. He would have paid his debt to society with his prison term and be spared any further punishment. </p> <p>But because his crimes involved children, with the special fear and revulsion that arouses in all of us, we are happy to jettison a cherished principle of justice that has served us well for centuries. \"No country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil,\" said a Daily Mail article. \"All we can hope is that, wherever he ends up, he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children.\" But we traditionally lock people up only for crimes they have committed, not for crimes they may commit in the future. And, anyway, how will the Mail know \"when he ceases to be a threat to children\"? It can't and won't, so it presumably wants him locked up for life, just to be on the safe side.</p> <p>In an eloquent article in yesterday's Times, Carol Sarler wrote that it was time to decide whether paedophilia should be regarded as a disease, beyond the control of the person who suffers from it; for if that were the case, it would be perfectly reasonable to have someone like Glitter sectioned under the Mental Health Act and put away indefinitely to prevent him putting any other children at risk. But that's not the way the media care to look at it. They seem to regard Glitter as both responsible for his actions and incapable of stopping them, a man who is not sick but just irredeemably wicked. And they take this to justify any degree of persecution of someone who has yet to commit any new offence and claims, however implausibly, that all he wants is to go shopping and have hospital treatment for his heart. </p> <p><strong>In deciding whether or not to choose Senator Joe Biden </strong>of Delaware as his vice-presidential running mate, Barack Obama must have weighed up the possible implications of a famous plagiarism scandal of 1987, which had the improbable consequence of making Neil Kinnock a household name in the United States. Biden, who had been running for the Democratic nomination at the time, had his presidential hopes dashed after it was found that he had lifted whole sections of a campaign speech from one given by Kinnock in Britain about social inequality. </p> <p>\"Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university? Why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family ever to go to college?\" asked Biden - which was almost word for word what Kinnock had said about himself and his wife Glenys in a tear-jerking account of his deprived Welsh upbringing.</p> <p>It was more than 20 years ago that Biden suffered his humiliation, but it might still tell against him; for the Americans are very censorious about plagiarism. It wasn't always so. Until the end of the 19th century, nobody either there or in Britain thought much about it. If noticed at all, it was taken as flattery. But now accusations of plagiarism are constantly made in attempts to cast doubt on a politician's honesty and integrity. John McCain has been accused of stealing a prison story from Alexander Solzhenitsyn and lifting items from Wikipedia for his speeches, while Obama has been similarly maligned on several occasions.</p> <p>Politicians, in fact, have never balked at adopting any good phrase from any source if it suited their purpose. Franklin D Roosevelt's declaration that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" was stolen from the first-century Greek philosopher Epictetus, and President Kennedy's \"ask not what your country can do for you\" was adapted from an address in 1884 by the writer Oliver Wendell Holmes. </p> <p>I see nothing wrong in it myself, and only wish that presidential candidates would find something else to argue about than each other's characters. </p> <p><strong>This week Alexander sat </strong>on the plane back to London from Pisa next to a little girl who was engrossed throughout the flight by Summer Term at St Clare's by Enid Blyton, just voted Britain's best-loved writer: \"I would have read much more if my elder brother, in a fit of Savonarolan destruction, hadn't burned all my beloved Blyton books when I was eight.\"</p>",
  "<p>A pair of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/21/pakistan.blast/index.html\">suicide bombings earlier today that killed at least 100 people at a government arms factory</a> near Pakistan's capital Islamabad is the latest in a series of deadly attacks that have been on the rise in Pakistan. Tehrik-e-Taliban, Pakistan's Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack and promised that more would come if the Pakistani military continued its recent offensive against militant groups in the Bajaur Agency, one of the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. During the past year, violence between Pakistan's security forces and the Taliban has increased, as have the number of terrorist attacks like the one today. <br> The attack came as Pakistan's political leadership discussed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/aug/19/whatnowforpakistan1\">who will succeed former president Pervez Musharraf</a> after his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\">resignation on Monday</a>. What does Musharraf's departure mean for US policy? In the immediate term, not much. The challenges posed by Pakistan are not that different today than they were while Musharraf was in office, and if anything his exit could be a blessing in disguise.</p> <p>Pakistan remains at the nexus of the most pressing global security challenges: nuclear weapons, international terrorism, religious extremism and endemic poverty. Stability and security in Pakistan directly impact international efforts to stabilise Afghanistan, since the Taliban have used the lawless border region as a safe haven to stage attacks. US intelligence agencies have repeatedly issued intelligence estimates during the past year warning about the threat posed by <a href=\"http://washingtonindependent.com/view/taliban-al-qaeda\">al-Qaida safe havens in Pakistan</a>. Under Musharraf, Pakistan achieved little progress on these vital issues, and the US was getting very little in return for its strong support of Musharraf.<br> For far too long, the US built its Pakistan policy on the shaky foundation of personal relationships with individual leaders. Although President Bush spoke of a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2177249/\">\"freedom agenda\"</a> as his core strategy for the world \u2013 based on the notion that advancing freedom and democracy would defeat the forces of terrorism \u2013 his policies, did not match his rhetoric in Pakistan, and Pakistanis saw through the hypocrisy. When Bush remarked last year that Musharraf <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/20/AR2007112002304_pf.html\">\"truly is somebody who believes in democracy\"</a> \u2013 just after Musharraf imposed emergency rule, shut down free media outlets, sacked judges and jailed thousands of lawyers and civil society activists - some people here in Pakistan wondered if Bush was talking about the Musharraf they knew. In the span of eight years, Bush went from not even knowing Musharraf's name on the campaign trail in 2000 to not understanding who Musharraf had become as a leader.<br> With Musharraf gone, the US has an opportunity to put its approach to Pakistan on a more solid foundation, one that is less dependent on individual personalities. One immediate challenge in post-Musharraf Pakistan is selecting a new president \u2013 and the tensions between the two leading political parties, the Pakistan People's Party headed by Asif Ali Zardari and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)\">Pakistan Muslim League N</a> headed by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif \u2013 have been growing even before Musharraf's departure. Without their opposition to Musharraf to keep them together in the tenuous alliance of convenience that had emerged since February's parliamentary elections, Pakistan may see an increase in political infighting over power. The US should avoid picking sides in this political battle and instead seek to develop stronger relationships with a wide range of Pakistani leaders \u2013 including the top officials in provincial governments - as well as a range of opposition leaders. The US already has strong ties with security officials like Pakistan's army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, but it should seek to expand and broaden these relationships.<br> Perhaps more important than these relationships with a broader range of Pakistani leaders, the US should adopt a more comprehensive strategy for Pakistan \u2013 one that is less focused on conventional military tactics and one that uses the full range of America's considerable powers. In recent months, US defence secretary Robert Gates has made important, but little noticed, speeches on the need to adjust the US global strategy by investing in other aspects of US power. In a speech last November, Gates argued: \"One of the most important lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win: economic development, institution-building and the rule of law, promoting internal reconciliation, good governance, providing basic services to the people, training and equipping indigenous military and police forces, strategic communications and more \u2013 these, along with security, are essential ingredients for long-term success.\" A new strategy for Pakistan should be based on this vision. It should put at its central focus the positive lesson learned from the Bush administration's best foreign policy moment: the earthquake relief the US delivered to Pakistan's citizens in 2005. To advance stability in Pakistan, the US should prioritise the policies that most directly improve the wellbeing and prosperity of the Pakistani people. Facing impeachment proceedings and a Pakistani public who had lost faith in his leadership, Musharraf had few options but to go. The US now has an historic opportunity to make a fresh start and put its policy on Pakistan on a solid foundation. By building stronger ties with a wide range of Pakistani leaders and taking tangible steps to demonstrate to the Pakistani people that we are interested in helping them improve their security and prosperity, we can move beyond the \"war on terror\" mindset, crouched in the defensive and dependent on individual leaders like Musharraf, and project a more confident strategy that will improve our security and prosperity by putting a stronger emphasis on the prosperity of the Pakistani people.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/1117409,elexpoll082008.article\">is up in the national polls</a>. And, interestingly enough, none of my Democratic friends seem to be worried about that. I think I know why.</p> <p>People sometimes forget that the term \"campaign\" was originally a military term. Thinking of American elections as a kind of non-violent civil war can be a helpful, if crude, metaphor. And in this war we have two very different kinds of armies duking it out, with competing strategies and contingencies and tactics being developed in the lead-up to election day.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is focusing their resources on a combination of air war and guerrilla war, making big advertisement buys in key states to broadcast a steady succession of <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/31/mccain_ads_go_negative_early_on_obama/\">increasingly negative political ads</a>, while simultaneously encouraging the electronic version of a whispering campaign by viral emails that paint Barack Obama as everything from a latte-sipping elitist liberal to a radical black activist to the <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/08/19/obama-to-mccain-dont-question-my-patriotism/\">slurs on his patriotism</a> that reference his name and parentage.</p> <p>McCain's is a pretty traditional campaign. Television advertising has gotten more sophisticated and expensive since the 1960 Nixon/Kennedy debates showed the medium's potential for impact on the election. The one new factor, the insidious viral emails, have been effective largely at shoring up McCain's dwindling base and have been able to do so without much cost or accountability. The <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/08/16/mccains_fund_raising_machine_rolling_along/\">money is finally rolling in</a>, thanks to the efforts of McCain's fundraisers, and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/05/AR2008080503010.html\">he's using it on TV ads</a>.</p> <p>The McCain campaign's problem is that they are fighting this war with the tools of the last one. There's little innovation at work, and his advisers have dramatically misread the battleground. The days when you could win the hearts and minds of the American public with 30-second television spots is over for good. With the Obama campaign <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iU_P23eyGmxqE8EEa7ba6r86BpIwD92MHQ8G0\">able to match</a> - and even out-spend - McCain dollar for dollar, if the air war was the only battle that mattered, then it might, indeed, be a toss-up.</p> <p>But looking at the electorate in 2004 or even 2000 terms would be a dramatic miscalculation. While the overall demographics of America have shifted as the second world war generation dies off and the number of immigrants grows, the character of the electorate - the registered voters - will be much, much different this time around. This is largely because of Obama's ground war.</p> <p>McCain has budgeted virtually nothing for his own ground war - the volunteers and paid employees who go out on the street and convince people to vote. McCain is depending on the traditional Republican-oriented organisations (evangelicals, gun owners, anti-abortion activists) to do that job, and the fact is that those groups are ambivalent toward McCain at best. There is no great voter-registration initiative within the Republican party this year.</p> <p>Not so for Obama. Seasoned by an interminably long 50-state primary season, the Obama campaign was forced to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012802558_pf.html\">build an organisation</a>, sometimes from scratch, in every state. The campaign often eschewed the traditional Democratic party apparatus (because of the number of entrenched Hillary Clinton folks within it) and built (or co-opted) their own state organisations. That, combined with the Obama campaign's far-sighted voter-registration drive, has changed the battlefield significantly. Obama didn't put his people in mothballs after winning the nomination, or even focus them on fundraising. He had them pounding the pavement with clipboards, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121850477150231953.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">registering voters</a> everywhere they could. That's why they aren't acting worried.</p> <p>My Republican friends cackled with glee when they saw the poll numbers recently, numbers that showed McCain catching up to Obama in the national polls. If it comes down to a horserace, they reasoned, the incumbent party could probably eek out a last-second victory. I let them have their moment - it was, after all, the first sign of life in the campaign since it began. </p> <p>But they are mistaken, as are McCain's strategists, because the poll numbers targeting \"likely voters\" are flawed. They don't take into account this rapid and significant expansion of the Democratic party, the millions of new voters who will come to the polls in support of the Democrats (many of whom either don't have land-line phones or don't answer polls). Some estimates place the disparity between new voter registrations between Democrats and Republicans at close to 35 to one. That's a significantly larger battlefield than in 2004, and the wedge issues of that election - gay marriage and abortion - just aren't getting the GOP faithful excited.</p> <p>Here in North Carolina, the Obama campaign is a well-established, well-oiled machine by now. Still feeling the swell of support from the primary that put Obama over the top, the local Obama campaigners are issuing daily emails, organising weekly voter-demonstration drives across the state and (more importantly) forging a new kind of politically active Democratic community. </p> <p>These are the foot-soldiers that Obama can count on to take a few days off from work, toil 24 hours a day and drive their databases of new voters to the polls. They have an underdog mentality and constantly expect and prepare for the kind of dirty politics the south is renowned for to erupt at any moment. To my knowledge, McCain's campaign has nothing similar. Hence their emphasis on the air war.</p> <p>Talking face-to-face with Obama's volunteers, it's clear they want to leave nothing to chance. They don't want North Carolina to go red on the basis of a few hundred votes. They want to see it firmly in the Democratic camp, our electoral votes going to Obama. But even if they fail, they tell me, they won't feel it was in vain. Hundreds of state and local Democrats will benefit from the Obama campaign's diligent work, as voters vote the straight Democratic party ticket and bring them into office. And that will ensure that even if the battle for the presidency is lost here (to extend the martial metaphor) the war for control of the direction of the state and the nation will have been soundly won.</p>",

  "<p>The Republican, John McCain, who only days ago said it took an annual income of $5m to be counted among the truly rich, today came under attack for admitting he had lost track of how many homes he owned.</p> <p>In a godsend to the Democrats, McCain was caught out when asked in an interview how many homes he owned. \"I think -- I'll have my staff get to you,\" McCain told Politico, an insider publication, and then muttered something about condominiums.</p> <p>McCain's wife, Cindy, inherited one of America's biggest beer distributors and has an estimated worth of about $200m. The couple reportedly own seven homes in Arizona, California and Virginia, worth a combined total of about $13m.</p> <p>However, the McCain campaign told Politico the figure was four.</p> <p>The Obama camp has been trying to draw attention to the McCain family's wealth -- in part to defend the Democrat against Republican charges that he is elitist.</p> <p>The Democrats reacted today on several fronts. In Chester, Virginia, Obama said McCain was out of touch.</p> <p>\"Somebody asked John McCain, 'How many houses do you have?' And he said, I'm not sure. I'll have to check with my staff. True quote: I'm not sure, I'll have to check with my staff.\"</p> <p>His campaign went on to release a new television advertisement -- called Seven after the number of McCain's properties -- attacking the Republican record on the economy. </p> <p>It also lined up events around the country to keep the controversy over McCain's comments alive.</p> <p>The potential damage to McCain was magnified by previous controversies over his wife's refusal to make a full disclosure about her finances, as well as his previous comments.</p> <p>Earlier in the campaign, McCain said he believed America's economy remained strong. An adviser dismissed concern about the housing crisis and petrol prices as whining.</p> <p>On Saturday, McCain moved into even more dangerous territory when he suggested at a forum on religion at a California megachurch that it would take an annual income of more than $5m to rank as rich in America.</p> <p>Obama, asked the same question, said those making above $250,00 a year counted as wealthy.</p>",
  "<p>It has become fashionable for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/20/georgeosborne.conservatives1\">Conservative politicians</a> and others to blame the state for almost everything. The state is blamed for rising income and wealth inequalities, the banking crisis, pensioner poverty, failed regulation, housing shortages, rising utility prices, complex tax laws and almost everything else under the sun. They rarely acknowledge the role of their ideologies in creating the very failures that they complain of. </p> <p>Over the last 35 years, the UK state has been thoroughly restructured to advance the interests of the rich and major corporations. Through financial contributions, lobbying, funding of thinktanks, friendly journalists, consultancies for legislators and jobs for potential and former ministers, they have colonised public policy making. The consensus about advancing social rights, equitable distribution of wealth and developing a just society has been eschewed in favour of markets, laissez-faire, light-touch regulation, corporate profits and tax cuts for the rich. </p> <p>The state, we continue to be told, is the problem and gets in the way of market efficiency, but neoconservatives are very adept at using the state to serve their interests. The private finance initiative (PFI) developed by the Conservatives and championed by Labour, ensures that the profits of many companies are relatively risk-free and guaranteed by the taxpayer. </p> <p>Corporate thinktanks, accountancy firms and the mega-rich are closely involved with the shaping of tax laws. The state obliges by giving tax concessions to non-dom millionaires. Tax breaks are created for specialist sectors (eg farming, movies) and soon exploited by others. Tax cuts for companies and the rich have been financed by wealth transfers from the most vulnerable. The last Conservative government reduced the state pension by breaking its link with average earnings and condemned many pensioners to poverty. Labour has not yet restored the link. The recent \"10p in the \u00a3\" fiasco is a continuation of the ideology that transfers wealth to the well-off. </p> <p>The state has been used to smash trade unions and dilute worker's rights and their ability to secure an equitable share of wealth. The result is that the share of the GDP going to workers in the form of wages and salaries has been reduced from <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/article.asp?n=623\">65.1% in 1975 to 52.6% in 1996</a>. In 2006, it stood at 55.6%, a decline of 10% on 30 years. The Conservatives opposed the <a href=\"http://www.essex.ac.uk/afm/accounting/Sikka%20Essex%20working%20paper.pdf\">national minimum wage (pdf)</a> and Labour appeased the elites by setting it at a low level. This has produced record corporate profits and fat-cat salaries for few, but hardship for many. </p> <p>Seduced by the myth that private sector is somehow super-efficient, successive governments have privatised almost everything. Gas, electricity, water, telecommunications and many other industries have been sold at knockdown prices to enable a select few to become millionaires. The Conservatives bribed the electorate with few cheap shares, but none of this offered people any control over fat-cat executives, prices or quality of services. Labour has continued with the same policies. Regulators of gas, electricity, water, mobile phone and other sectors have either come from within the industry or are eyeing lucrative jobs there. All too often they see the issues through corporate lenses and have failed to protect consumers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/04/economy\">Light regulation</a> and trusting the corporate elites has been a key factor in the recurring financial crisis. Normal people have been sold dud pensions, endowment mortgages and financial products. The regulators often do too little, too late. Even though people's savings, pensions and investments were tied up in the financial system, regulators did not monitor the financial dealings of banks. They were left free to speculate and gamble on stock markets. The regulators took no action even though billions of dollars of liabilities and toxic debts were not reported in the accounts of banks. The same opponents of effective regulation are only too pleased to accept state sponsored bailouts.</p> <p>We are witnessing the results of the failed ideologies of conservatism, eagerly embraced by all the major political parties. We have bigger financial scandals, pensioner poverty, increasing income inequality and prospects of greater social strife. The dominant ideology of prioritising markets and appeasing corporate elites need to be replaced by policies that prioritise the concerns of normal people. Without this fundamental shift there is no prospect of building a fair and just society.</p>",
  "<p>A Swiss daredevil's bid to cross the English Channel propelled by a jet-powered wing strapped to his back moved a step closer yesterday with a successful 36km test flight over Switzerland. </p> <p>The flight proves that his jet-powered wing can take him far enough to make it across the channel from Calais to Dover.

If there are no technical problems, it's OK for the English Channel. I can't wait for this next challenge!\"</p> <p>His attempt had originally been thwarted by a collection of technical failures, including a leaking gas tank and two aborted flights during which the engines stopped within seconds of jumping from his support plane. He blamed these failures \u2013 which forced him to deploy his parachutes early \u2013 on \"electronic interference problems\".</p> <p>The successful flight involved him jumping out of the aircraft at 2,300m, flying horizontally under jet power from a height of 1,700m and then switching off the jet engines before deploying two parachutes at 1500m and 1200m. </p> <p>The wing does not include moving parts such as flaps to control direction, but Rossy is able to steer by shifting his weight and moving his head. </p> <p>When he reached the ground he still had 2 litres of fuel left in his wing, suggesting that he would have some margin for error during the cross-channel flight.</p> <p>Rossy is a former military pilot.

  "<p>US negotiators have not yet succeeded in getting Iraqi officials to agree to keep US troops well into the next US president's first term, the US secretary of state confirmed yesterday.</p> <p>On a surprise visit to Baghdad, Condoleezza Rice, denied earlier reports this week that the two sides had ironed out the last disputes in a heavily-contested draft agreement that is due to replace the UN mandate covering the US occupation. </p> <p>President Bush wants the pact to authorise a troop presence at least until 2011 so that he can trumpet it as proof of his policy's success. But the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al Maliki, has adopted the rising nationalism in the Iraqi parliament and public and is insisting on a clear withdrawal timetable, the lifting of judicial immunity for US troops who commit abuses, and an Iraqi veto on US military operations, including the arrest of Iraqis. </p> <p>The pact has been downgraded into a \"memorandum of understanding\" so as to avoid the need for the US Senate to approve it. In Iraq it has to go through several hurdles. \"Once a breakthrough has really been achieved, the draft will be presented to the Council of Ministers\", Raid Fahmi Jahid, the minister of science and technology told the Guardian yesterday. </p> <p>If the government approves, the Iraqi parliament will have the last word. </p> <p>The Iraqi side has been pressing for US combat troops to be pulled out of Iraqi cities by the end of next June, and for all troops to leave a year or so later. But after talks yesterday Rice said that only \"aspirational timetables\" were worth having in the agreement. </p> <p>The Bush administration was angered last month when Maliki gave broad support to senator Barack Obama's pledge to pull all combat troops out of Iraq by June 2010. This undermined his Republican rival senator John McCain's insistence, along with the Bush administration, that withdrawals be linked to achieving various political and security goals, the so-called \"conditions-based approach\" as opposed to \"artificial timetables\". </p> <p>Bush officials also insist that it is the success of the \"surge\" of an extra 30,000 US troops last year which has made talk of a troop reduction possible. They accuse Obama of underplaying the surge. The presumptive Democratic candidate argues that progress in getting political reconciliation among Iraqis was meant to go hand-in-hand with improved security and this has not happened. </p> <p>\"We're making an agreement because the surge has worked. Iraqi forces have demonstrated they are strong and getting stronger\", Rice declared yesterday. </p> <p>Addressing a press conference with Rice, Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi foreign minister, said the draft talked of the \"temporary presence and time horizon and mission of US troops\". </p> <p>Rice's visit yesterday was also aimed at getting Iraqi leaders to agree to a law setting out terms for provincial elections, another Bush benchmark for claiming success. The draft was vetoed by President Jalal Talabani last month after MPs unexpectedly tagged on an amendment putting the city of Kirkuk under joint Kurdish, Arab, and Turcoman control. The Kurds currently have a majority in the council and reacted furiously. </p> <p>The US is urging Iraqi MPs to set the Kirkuk issue aside and hold elections in the rest of Iraq anyway.</p>",
  "<p>British security services colluded in the unlawful detention and facilitated the interrogation of a UK resident detained in Pakistan six years ago, the high court ruled today.</p> <p>Two judges found that the foreign secretary had a duty to hand over to Binyam Mohamed's legal team secret information that could support his case that he was tortured in Pakistan and Morocco before being sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones found that the British security service <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/21/mohamed_full210808.pdf\">\"facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the United States incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in Pakistan\" (pdf)</a> in 2002. </p> <p>The detention was unlawful under Pakistani law, the judges said.</p> <p>Mohamed, a 30-year-old Ethiopian national who worked as a caretaker in London, was charged by the US with terror offences in May and could face the death penalty if found guilty by a military tribunal.</p> <p>The judges found the handing over of information held by the British government about the alleged torture Mohamed suffered was \"essential for him to have his case fairly considered\".</p> <p>\"Without that information, BM [Mohamed] will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces, given the confessions made by him in Bagram and Guant\u00e1namo Bay in 2004,\" the judges ruled.</p> <p>\"It is a longstanding principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial.\"</p> <p>However, the judges did not order the immediate handover, saying they wanted the foreign secretary to have the opportunity to consider the national security implications of their finding. </p> <p>The court will decide on the issue following a further hearing next week.</p> <p>The judges said the court had established that the British secret service facilitated the questioning of Mohamed. </p> <p>\"By seeking to interview BM in the circumstances found [in Pakistan] and supplying information and questions for his interviews, the relationship between the United Kingdom government and the United States authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing.\"</p> <p>During the hearing of the case, Dinah Rose QC, for Mohamed, said he was tortured after his detention in Pakistan. </p> <p>He was rendered to Morocco where he was subjected to more prolonged and brutal torture after being made to \"disappear\", she said.</p> <p>The former Kensington caretaker alleges he was repeatedly slashed in the genitals with a razor blade while being held in Morocco. Finally, he was rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where he has spent the past four years.</p> <p>Rose told the judges the US authorities denied that Mohamed had been subjected to extraordinary rendition or torture. But there were strong grounds for believing that MI6 and MI5 held independent evidence supporting his story of torture.</p> <p>Lawyers for the Foreign Office argued at the hearing that the government had acted within its powers and was not legally obliged to make the disclosures sought. The foreign secretary was entitled to proceed on the basis that the US legal system would safeguard Mohamed's rights, they said.</p> <p>To disclose the documents sought would cause serious damage to national security, it was submitted.</p> <p>A significant part of the case took place in closed session due to the sensitivity of much of the material before the court.</p> <p>Today's judgment said the foreign secretary accepted that Mohamed had established an arguable case that he was \"subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the United States\". It was also accepted that he had an arguable case that he was subject to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.</p> <p>\"The court finds on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing, the [British] security service facilitated it,\" the judgment said.</p> <p>Mohamed's solicitor, Richard Stein, of Leigh Day &amp; Co, said: \"Today's judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the United States government in the supposed 'war on terror'.</p> <p>\"It has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law. We can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to Binyam's defence team.\"</p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, who has represented Mohamed since 2005, described the ruling as a \"momentous decision\".</p> <p>\"Compelling the British government to release information that can prove Mr Mohamed's innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered.</p> <p>\"The next step is for the British government to demand an end to the charade against him in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and return him home to Britain,\" he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the department was considering the implications of the judgment very carefully.</p> <p>\"For strong reasons of national security, to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight, we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily.\"</p> <p>The ruling acknowledged that the British government last year requested that Mohamed be returned to the UK and that Britain had gone to \"great lengths\" to assist him.</p>",
  "<p>\"If a child does not want to attend school, you the parent should punish them heavily and force them into school,\" one woman told a meeting to teach community members about education for orphans and vulnerable children.</p> <p>But a man seated on the lawn a few metres away had another suggestion: \"The children also need to be taught to understand the importance of education,\" he said, as more villagers itched to have their say.</p> <p>Some parents, another man said, keep children at home to work in gardens; why don't the local council leaders punish them?</p> <p>\"To help get children with disabilities into school,\" another man suggested, \"children without disabilities should be taught not to laugh at the disabled and make them hate school.\"</p> <p>The meeting at Olwelai Primary School was one of six parish meetings that Amref is holding to encourage parents and guardians to take children \u2013 particularly orphaned and otherwise vulnerable children \u2013 to school. Amref says that although Uganda has tuition-free primary education, some children still miss out.</p> <p>Officials from the Soroti District Education office and Amref's project staff facilitated the meeting, urging the roughly 100 mothers and fathers present to keep their children in school, as well as answering any questions raised.</p> <p>Amref also intends to work with village council leaders to collect statistics of children with learning disabilities; according to Amref's project assistant for education, Molly Ameru, the NGO will use this information to advocate for special needs teachers to help such children. Katine currently has only one special needs teacher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336846652\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2008/08/21/Katine-schools-meeting-smal.jpg\" alt=\"Katine schools meeting small\" width=\"220\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mothers and their children listen during the meeting. Photograph: Richard M Kavuma</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard M Kavuma/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although barely 100 people from the parish population of 5,000 attended, they demonstrated ample knowledge of the issues that lock some children out of school. One woman wanted the government to fund school meals, since children can't learn without eating. Another suggested that a classroom with stairs should also have a ramp to ease the access for disabled children.</p> <p>There were also suggestions that classrooms should be painted so that they are more attractive to pupils; as well as questions about teachers who drive children out of school either by caning or being excessively harsh.</p> <p>Responding to the mother who wanted school meals, the Inspector of Schools for Katine sub-county, Charles Okiror, said the government had relieved parents of the burden of tuition fees so that they would only have to feed their children and buy them scholastic materials. His sentiments echoed those of Uganda's Education minister, Namirembe Bitamazire, who told me earlier this year that feeding was \"100 per cent\" the responsibility of parents.</p> <p>Okiror also urged parents to avoid marrying off their daughters at ages as young as 14, reminding them that under Ugandan law it was illegal for anyone to marry a girl below 18. But one grey-haired woman, unimpressed with Okiror's advice, retorted: \"Even if you don't marry them off, they will get pregnant before they are 18 anyway.\"</p> <p>These issues \u2013 of school meals and girls' education \u2013 epitomise some of the dilemmas facing Uganda's education system. The government says the parents must feed their children; but parents in many rural areas such as Katine say they cannot find food to pack for their children. Likewise, poor parents marrying off teenage daughters to get \"bride wealth\" or the girls being lured out of school by richer men are some of the reasons girls don't go far enough in school.</p> <p>The Soroti district deputy education officer, Everest Okello, said a meeting such as this one was highly useful because it helped parents to appreciate their roles in supporting primary schools. \"Only when the community understands that a school like this belongs to them, will they give it all the support it needs,\" Okello said.</p> <p>But Okello admitted that his under-funded department did not have a budget for outreach activities. \"In fact, the first arrangement that helped us to reach communities was the PHASE [Personal Hygiene and Sanitation in Education] programme, which was also implemented by Amref,\" he said. PHASE ended last year.</p>",
  "<p>More than a year after abortion was decriminalised in Mexico City, abortion opponents hope the Mexican supreme court will reverse the legislation in a decision that could reverberate across Mexico and Latin America.</p> <p>Mexico's highest court heard public testimony in the spring, and is expected to rule as early as this month on the constitutionality of the local abortion measure.</p> <p>The Federal District is governed by the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution. Through its control of the city assembly, the party in April 2007 legalised abortion in the city for women who are up to 12 weeks pregnant.</p> <p>The measure is unusual because it legalises abortion in the capital. Except in cases of rape or risks to the mother's life, abortion remains illegal in most of rest of this devoutly Roman Catholic nation.</p> <p>States in Mexico set their own policies on abortion rights, and only Yucatan in Mexico's far south has allowed abortion in cases of extreme poverty.</p> <p>University studies estimate between 500,000 and 1 million abortions take place in Mexico annually, but most are of questionable legality.</p> <p>The Catholic Church and anti-abortion activists want the high court to strike down the Mexico City measure. They argue that life begins at conception and carrying out an abortion amounts to a taking of life that violates Mexico's constitution.</p> <p>\"A person's life has such a great value that we cannot take it, we are not the owners,\" insists Ana Elena Cantu, a city legislator in the northern industrial city of Monterrey and an anti-abortion leader in Mexico.</p> <p>But the 11 members of Mexico's high court may look beyond the constitutional question.</p> <p>\"It is not a philosophical debate. It is mostly about the criminality. Should you or should you not be penalising it,\" said Miguel Sarre, a university law professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.</p> <p>In prior rulings, Mexico's high court declared abortion to be a crime but said it should not be penalised.</p> <p>That ruling mollified both sides, but such a broad decision is unlikely this time, Sarre said, partly because Mexico City is drawing women in from other parts of the nation for abortions.</p> <p>Since May 2007, 12 participating public hospitals in Mexico City have performed more than 12,000 free abortions, and are averaging about 35 to 40 such procedures per day, according to the city's director of emergency medical services, Dr. Arturo Gaytan. Most of the women are poor, he said.</p> <p>\"There isn't a way to measure this. What was clandestine is now authorised. We don't know what the measure is outside these medical units,\" Gaytan said.</p> <p>Women who could afford it traditionally went to private clinics for abortions that technically were illegal. Today, these clinics continue to perform the procedures, but women who visit them have more recourse.</p> <p>\"If something happens, your family or you have legal grounds to allege negligence,\" said Daphne, a 23-year-old law student who first spoke to McClatchy Newspapers in March 2007 as she readied to have an abortion just weeks before it became legal.</p> <p>Speaking again on condition that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy, Daphne said she would still choose a private clinic today for an abortion because \"people are still afraid of the (public) institutions\".</p> <p>To combat that image of poor quality, city health officials point to the number of recorded deaths of mothers during the procedure. In 2005, 15 women died during a reported abortion, eight in 2006, one in 2007 and none in 2008, Gaytan said.</p> <p>\"What this suggests is that procedures in clandestine areas have disappeared and given way to this,\" he said.</p> <p>Of the now-decriminalised abortions at public hospitals, 39 percent involved women who already have children and cannot afford another. Students represented almost 27 percent of the women seeking abortions, while 20 percent were maids and domestic workers. In 58 percent of the cases, the women seeking an abortion had an intrauterine device implanted to prevent another unwanted pregnancy.</p>",
  "<p>Official sources in Spain have been fairly quiet about the circumstances surrounding the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/spain1\">crash of the Spanair airliner</a> at Madrid Barajas airport.</p> <p>That is not unusual. Officials don't like to give any details except<br>time, place and casualty figures until they are in possession of facts \u2013 precise facts. All we really know is that something went wrong that caused the pilots to lose control of their aircraft. Spanair's representatives have drawn attention to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/madrid.spain2\">faulty valve</a> reported by the pilot before the plane's first attempt at takeoff \u2013 but technicians cleared the plane for a second attempt.</p> <p>If the black boxes that have been have discovered yield the information they should, in a few days the investigators may know what happened \u2013 in fair detail. They will know, in four dimensions (the fourth is time) all about the aircraft's short trajectory to its fatal impact: details like continual traces of its speed, height and lateral position; the precise manoeuvres the aircraft made before impact; the control inputs the pilots made to counter what was happening; which systems were working, which were not, and when and how they failed.</p> <p>For example we will know whether, indeed, the left engine failed and caught fire as alleged by witnesses, because no official source has yet confirmed this.</p> <p>But although we will know what happened, it will take much longer to<br>establish why. When something breaks, you can tell it did because you can find the pieces. The essential thing is then to establish why it broke, so you can ensure that others using the same equipment can inspect it for weaknesses.</p> <p>If it turns out to be true that this aircraft really did suffer an engine failure and fire, that alone does not explain why it crashed. Any modern aircraft has to be designed such that it can survive the total loss of an engine's power at the most critical point in the takeoff run. This point, calculated for every flight and known as the decision speed (pilots call it V1), is the point during the takeoff run when there is no longer sufficient distance in which to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway, so takeoff has to continue. Modern aircraft, including this one, have to have the performance to continue the takeoff run and get airborne using the one remaining engine, fly a circuit of the airfield, and land again safely.</p> <p>Since the pilots were unable to abandon this takeoff in time, or to take off successfully and return to land, there must have been more than a simple failure of power, otherwise the pilots would not have lost control of the aircraft.</p>",
  "<h2>Drakenstein prison</h2> <p>I am sitting at the table at which South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was drafted, in the peach-coloured prison cottage at Drakenstein. It is what Mandela called his \"gilded cage\", a halfway house between imprisonment and freedom. Around the table, key negotiators would sit \u2013 the then president FW de Klerk, minister Gerrit Viljoen, ANC members and Mandela's family.</p> <p>The cottage is now closed to the public, but the prison authorities have plans to open it as a museum after acquiring ownership of the house from the Department of Arts and Culture. </p> <p>The Simonsberg mountains stretch far into the distance beneath a clear blue sky. \"The mountain was an inspiration. He gained his strength here, orientating himself and getting a grip,\" says Manfred Jacobs, who works in the prison services. Mandela was so fond of this cottage that he ordered an exact replica of it to be built at his home in the Eastern Cape. </p> <p>Mandela marked his 71st birthday in this cottage, his last in captivity before his final walk to freedom on February 11 1990. </p> <p>Although his movement was monitored, Mandela asserted control where possible, says Jacobs: \"He said to the wardens: 'Tell me to move from A to B, but I will determine the pace'. That's exactly what he did. He stood his ground and it was not easy. He determined the pace of his release; the pace of negotiations. Some wanted to take up arms but Mandela said this is not the way to go\". </p> <p>An \"animal of habit\", Mandela refused to sleep in the large master bedroom but in a bed in his study. He read newspapers beneath the fir trees, watched four ducks paddling on the swimming pool, exercised in his gym, ate meals cooked by a personal chef. \"The officials saw him as terrorist and enemy but, when they talked to him , they realised that what they had been taught was not true\", says Jacobs.</p> <p>\"We offer this trip down memory lane at the prison house, but it is ultimately a lesson to move on. We want to move forward as a nation, we have to. We cannot do it alone. We need supporters. There is a reason why we have the delete button, bleach, washing powder. Leaders make many mistakes but we believe that we can make so much change in the nation.\" </p> <h2>The most inhospitable outpost of apartheid</h2> <p>The sun strains over choppy seas as I head towards what former ANC leader Oliver Tambo called \"the most inhospitable outpost of apartheid\": Robben Island. </p> <p>Once, it held captive those deemed to be insane, leprosy sufferers and anti-apartheid protestors. Watches were banned and time passed so slowly that political ideas were debated at length. Mesh wire fence sprawls around the buildings and I am guided by a former prisoner, Mr Siswana who shouts his story above the caw-cawing of seagulls. </p> <p>Siswana spent five years here on a charge of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts related to the uprisings of 1976. </p> <p>The prison system aimed to wear down mind and body; with hard labour in limestone quarries and psychologically disorientating strategies such as mixing political prisoners with hardened convicts. </p> <p>Regimented prison life involved waking at half past four, eating meagre food, building gravel walls. </p> <p>\"We were not supposed to think,\" Siswana says. \"We didn't adapt well to prison life. It got so out of control. Most of us were teenage high school students. When they are in one place together, anything can happen\". </p> <p>There were many altercations with the wardens as the inmates tried to improve conditions. Attempts to escape from the island were fruitless. \"Those who tried to escape were thoroughly assaulted,\" Siswana says.</p> <p>It was essential to build a sense of community, achieved through sport. \"We talked to the wardens about rugby. But we would degenerate into politics and they didn't like it. We insisted that it was them that brought politics into sport.\"</p> <p>Walking down narrow, dim corridors, I finally arrive at Mandela's cell. Through the thick white bars, there are blankets, a bucket, windows welded so they could not be opened, an attempt to prevent any communication at all. </p> <p>Robben Island is a stunning landscape, with seagulls and wagtails flying before a rich sunset. Indeed, Mandela writes in Long Walk to Freedom: \"When I perceived the beauty of even this small, closed-in corner of the world, I knew that some day my people and I would be free.\"</p> <h2>Post-Mandela</h2> <p>Mandela's 90th birthday celebrations stretch across generations as well as geography. In the township of Khayelitsha on the outskirts of Cape Town, birthday cake is being savoured by those far too young to remember apartheid. At the <a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk/saga-charitable-trust/projects/south-africa/nokhanyo-educare-centre/nokhanyo-educare-centre.asp\">Nokhanyo Saga Charitable Trust school</a>, four-year-old children sing Happy Birthday to their national hero and 16-year-old Zikhona reads a poem she has written to her country. </p> <p>Nearby, a man named Golden sells roses, daisies and lilies. Golden moved to the township with his wife Phumla and five daughters, but had no home and no work. In this area of mass unemployment, Golden makes flowers from other people's waste, crafting discarded drinks cans.</p> <p>In a nearby shack, a teenage mother clutches her sons and tells me: \"We have no money, no food. We want change. I dream of going to school and being a social worker.\"</p> <p>The Nelson Mandela Children's Fund is investigating the possibilities of youth parliaments in response to the prevalence of child-headed households. \"We are experiencing a situation where the adult population is dying off, so children are on their own,\" a spokesperson from the charity tells me. To get support, the organisation is \"trying to change the mindset of corporate companies\". </p> <p>In the corner of the room, stands a grinning statue of Mandela, draped in Santa Claus costume. \"We are asking: what theory of change are you using?\" says the spokesperson. \"How do we change societies, empower communities?\" \u2013 a crucial question for future generations.</p> <p>\u2022 Anita Sethi travelled to South Africa with <a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk/travel/General3/\">Saga Holidays</a>.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> South London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Theo Kerlin (vocals, samples), Lab 18 (instruments). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Theo Kerlin aka Master Shortie is a 19-year-old musician, MC, songwriter, part-time actor and model who had a brief stint at the Brit School. He describes himself as \"a rapper, entrepreneur, samplemeister and indie/rap pioneer\" with a congenital aversion to being stereotyped. He's toured with indie favourites Hadouken! and rap legend Erik Sermon. He's been recording raps since he was 12 and handles all promotion, record-release, styling and marketing duties himself. They're calling him \"the poster boy of a DIY underground scene\", but we're not sure what scene that is. In fact, we're totally flummoxed as to what to make of the Swindon-born Kerlin. Is he a serious UK grime boy like Kano, Wiley and Sway, a potential grindie crossover artist, an old school hip-hop revivalist, a peddler of retro electrofunk, or a plain and simple future pop star? <br> Certainly his debut single Rope Chain is all over MTV Base at the moment and his MySpace has had a bazillion hits, but we still can't tell if he's a novelty rapper or a genuine innovator. Is he subverting US bling-rap with his Day-Glo crunk-wear, baseball caps and chains, or making a serious bid to become the British Lil Wayne? Does mixing and matching worn jeans with shiny fashion-wear constitute an attempt to bridge cultures, or was he just in a rush to get dressed? Mr Shortie, can you help? \"My music is a crossover between electro, indie and hip-hop,\" he explains, just in the nick of time. \"I don't limit myself to being part of one scene or group of people. If you're an indie kid you're an indie kid, if you're a grime kid you're a grime kid, if you're into reggae then you chill with the reggae guys. Whereas me, I'm dodging in and out of different crowds because each crowd and every person has a different thing to offer me.\" That's cleared that up, then. His 2009 debut album, recorded with studio whizz Lab 18, is ready to go and is already titled: ADHD. Shortie flaunts his short attention span and flits flightily between styles and genres, namechecking Paul Simon and Prince one minute, and sampling Adam Ant's Prince Charming and what sounds like Arctic Monkeys on the track Prince Charming the next. There's the Jay Z-quoting boyband electro-soul of Under the Moon, the rapped-up riff-rock of Dead End with its power-pop guitar and falsetto vocals, the symphonic hip-hop of Rope Chain and the 80s synths and melodies of Groupie Love and Merry Go Round. Apparently, the latter tune details a disastrous early-teen flirtation with the mainstream music industry, during which he had bad experiences with regard to deals and contracts, and there were attempts to control and pigeonhole him. This made him even more determined to do everything himself. Whether or not he'll eventually have to succumb and take advice on focusing his myriad ideas, there's no denying the kid's got talent and energy to burn. <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Master Shortie's fresh, enthusiastic self-made-man approach to making and releasing his music is an inspiration. He's the Real Deal.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> The truth is, we're not sure what to make of him, his music or his garish schizoid image \u2013 at his best, he's Dizzee and Calvin in one skinny, bug-eyed body. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Keep it old school.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Go back to school.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Rope Chain is released by Odd One Out (O1O) on September 1, followed by next single Dead End in October and the debut album ADHD in January 2009. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Wiley, Kano, Unklejam, Kriss Kross. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/mastershortie\">www.myspace.com/mastershortie</a><br> <strong><br>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> El Guincho.</p>",
  "<p>First they came for your mobile phone. Now, the dog.</p> <p>The California state senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would make it illegal for drivers to keep pets on their laps.</p> <p>Visalia, California, assembly member Bill Maze has taken plenty of grief from his fellow Republicans for pushing the bill, including conservative radio star Rush Limbaugh. But Maze did not back off, calling it a safety issue.</p> <p>\"If you have an animal that gets in your face or gets tangled up in your steering wheel while you're driving, you can't properly control (the car),\" he told the Sacramento Bee earlier this year.</p> <p>The assembly has already passed the bill but must agree to minor changes before the legislation heads to governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's desk.

  "<p>Many people today are unaware of how the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_1967\">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a> \u2013 whose chief architect, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/20/labour1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=politics\">Leo Abse</a>, died on Tuesday \u2013 was met with much wailing and gnashing of teeth. And not just from homophobes. </p> <p>In the Gay Liberation Front's <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/glf-london.html\">manifesto</a> (1971), the act is mentioned in a section headed \"How we are oppressed\". It states grudgingly: \"The 1967 Sexual Offences Act gave a limited licence to adult gay men \u2026 \" </p> <p>Gay journalists still often flex their radical muscles by listing the act's limitations; I've done it many times myself. </p> <p>Abse's act did not legalise gay sex, it just partly decriminalised it. It enshrined in law a number of inequalities, that would take decades to rectify. The age of consent for gay men was set at 21 when it was 16 for straight people. There were exclusions for the armed forces and merchant seamen. The act didn't cover Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands. And there was an incredibly narrow definition of \"private\" sexual acts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/15/britishidentity.fiction\">Colin MacInnes</a> wrote a waspish satire for Gay News in 1972, where two men chat each other up, but insist on seeing birth certificates, driving licences and national insurance numbers, just to ensure they're not breaking the restrictions on age, employment, or country of residence. Many have pointed out that prosecutions for gay sex actually went up in the years immediately after the act. </p> <p>I interviewed Leo Abse for <a href=\"http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/\">Gay Times</a> last summer, to mark the 40th anniversary of the act. Abse had much else to be proud of in his parliamentary career, he championed many other then unpopular causes; the abolition of capital punishment, divorce, family planning. But I could detect a certain sadness when he talked of the Sexual Offences Act. </p> <p>Not because it led to some sort of Sodom-and-Gomorrah-on-Thames (as some in the Lords had warned) but because of how he was criticised and castigated by gay men as if he was the villain, not the hero, of this piece. </p> <p>But Leo Abse was both brave and bold. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Berkeley\">Humphry Berkeley</a>, the chief backer of decriminalisation among Conservative MPs was booted out at the 1966 election. Abse was a Labour MP but the Labour government distanced itself from him. The prime minister, Harold Wilson, insisted Abse must present his proposals as a private member's bill, not a piece of government legislation. Wilson kept well away anyway, estimating in private it could cost Labour millions of votes. Abse told me he was sent shit through the post on an almost daily basis. </p> <p><a href=\"http://lse.ac.uk/library/archive/projects/grey.htm\">Antony Grey</a>, the key gay campaigner of the 1960s, later conceded that Abse was the only MP who could have possibly got that law through parliament. It very nearly didn't pass \u2013 Labour had a wafer-thin majority. Abse won over many of his fellow Labour MPs by pandering to their prejudices. He even gave me a little parody of the things he'd tell the House: \"Look, you are the wonderful fellows, you are good family men, you have children, marvellous wives \u2013 pity these poor people, they are not like you. They are quite different.'\" </p> <p>Abse said he didn't believe a word of this. He was a Freudian who believed we were all bisexual, and that it was fear of their own homosexuality that drove people to homophobia in the public and in parliament. (It also led him to refer to gay men in the House once as \"faulty males\" \u2013 something he told me he regretted.) </p> <p>At the time, Antony Grey was often exasperated with him and Abse understood why: \"It was difficult for him to accept when I said to him 'you can't do this, you've got to adapt,' because of his conviction. He was a lobbyist and he had to do his job as a lobbyist and I had to do my job as a parliamentarian \u2013 I wasn't propagandising, I was trying to get legislation. He would come into difficulties if he was found to be supporting my compromises, as he saw it \u2013 but I knew that you had to give them carrots in order to be able to get the result you wanted \u2013 and that the thing to do was take it easy, bit by bit.\"</p> <p>When Abse's bill became law in July 1967, Lord Arran emotionally quoted Oscar Wilde: \"My Lords, Mr Wilde was right: the road has been long and the martyrdoms many, monstrous and bloody. Today \u2013 please God! \u2013 sees the end of that road.\"</p> <p>Some 40 years on, Abse's law does not seem so much an act of betrayal, but the only way of initiating a process of change. It was this or nothing. For all its flaws and faults \u2013 and the many cruel injustices that continued long after it was passed \u2013 Leo Abse had finally prised open a door.</p>",
  "<p>I found out early I wasn't headed for a life of larceny when, during my sole bout of childhood theft - boosting Panini football stickers from a Hull newsagents - I broke rule No 1 and confessed my sins (my mum marched me back down to the shop).

  "<p>\"Dealing with climate change is the number one challenge facing the world today,\" said the Lib Dems last summer when they announced ambitious plans to make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/31/deepgreenthinking\">Britain zero carbon by 2050</a>. </p> <p>Climate change is still a challenge, but energy security is a sexier topic right now, and a new leader needs a new message. Hence, Nick Clegg's shift to focus on reducing Britain's \"ever increasing dependence on vulnerable foreign energy supplies\". Climate change and energy security are two sides of the same coin, after all, and measures to address one help with the other.</p> <p>The measures may be a year old, but are they any good? They were certainly widely lauded last year, mainly because they called the Labour and Conservative bet to reduce carbon pollution 60% and 80% respectively, and went all-in with a pledge to eliminate them completely.<br> A carbon neutral Britain in a little over four decades (perhaps as few as eight parliamentary terms) would be an astounding accomplishment, given that greenhouse gas emissions from almost all aspects of UK society are rising. </p> <p>Companies and politicians promise, and sometimes deliver, cuts in emissions, but check the small print: often the reduction is only against \"business as usual\" \u2013 in other words, emissions have still gone up, just not by as much as they were expected to. </p> <p>Britain is on track to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, but only because some major carbon sources (aviation and shipping most prominently) are left off the balance sheet. By any reasonable measure, Britain produces significantly more carbon dioxide pollution than in 1990. </p> <p>The refined Lib Dem energy strategy certainly identifies the problem correctly. It focuses on our fossil-fuel dependent electricity generators and our woefully insulated houses. It wants a massive investment in renewable energy to address the first, and promises beefed up building regulations and insulation paid for by the utility companies on the second.</p> <p>A ban on nuclear and coal would place a giant demand on new renewable sources, though the Lib Dem document fails to say how much renewable capacity it aims for. The short-fall will be made up by EU-sourced natural gas, with the carbon dioxide captured and stored. Again, no hard figures \u2013 and no technical guarantee it will work on the required scale either.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=489026\">Local Government Association</a> reckons \u00a3500m a year would insulate the leakiest 12m houses and reduce household emissions by a fifth, though the utility companies will be in no mood to cough up from their weakened profits.</p> <p>The move to install smart meters looks a good one (and one the present government is poised to announce) but we cannot be sure that the promised cuts in consumer electricity use will be sustained in the long term. But the pledge to make every new home built to a zero-carbon rating in a little over two years looks unrealistic, given the costs involved and the current problems in the building industry.</p> <p>Ambitious targets can be a good thing, of course, and a reluctance to think big has certainly hampered Britain's attempts on renewables so far. Perhaps their sluggish deployment could be accelerated by a quango body similar to the<a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/work-for-2012/index.php\"> Olympic Delivery Authority</a>, as the Lib Dems suggest. But do even these ambitious promises go far enough?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/21/greentech.energyefficiency\">Nick Clegg calls today for an \"Apollo project\" to make Britain energy independent by 2050</a>. The government's renewables advisers say it will cost \u00a3100bn to boost our renewable energy provision to just 15% by 2020. The cost of the decade long Apollo programme in today's money? \u00a370bn. Compared to fighting climate change (or tackling energy security), putting a man on the moon is small change.</p>",

Because the strong rain made the ground very, very heavy, very deep and very slippery some of the athletes who are not so strong in riding were very afraid on the ground and when they were jumping.\"</p> <p>\"We will have a meeting now with the management about the competition tomorrow. If there is some more rain we may have to do something about reducing the height of the obstacles,\" he said.</p> <p>Not all the riders thought the horses were good enough, though. \"When I saw them [the horses] in the preliminaries, I knew it was going to be difficult. I feel really sorry for Svoboda who deserved a medal. To be honest the horses weren't good enough for the Olympic Games,\" said Britain's Nick Woodbridge, who finished down the field in 25th.</p> <p>Woodbridge himself had no axe to grind for his undoing had come early on. In the shooting - the first phase - he had scored 856 points and was second-last of the 36 competitors. His swimming, in which he was second, and his riding, in which he was ninth, pulled him up the rankings.</p> <p>Svoboda was by no means the only competitor undone by the riding phase. The conditions could hardly have been worse: the rain was unrelenting, and the horses were clearly unsettled by a noisy crowd of around 30,000, causing most of the riders, who drew their horses from a pool of 23, to struggle.</p> <p>Sam Weale's mount, Diandian, didn't like the look of the third fence and there were any number of refusals. Weale, who eventually finished a very respectable 10th, racked up 164 penalty points, yet still finished 18th in the riding, so high were everyone else's penalties.</p> <p>Five riders as well as Svoboda were thrown from their horses. The Frenchman John Zakrzewski suffered most when his mount threw him, dragged him through the wall one way and then took him back through it in reverse. Zakrzewski, to his credit, still completed the run.</p> <p>Dominic Mahoney, Britain's team leader, who was an Olympic bronze medallist in Seoul, was less critical. \"There are three factors, the quality of the course, the quality of the horses and the quality of the riders. Ideally, you would want one or two to go clear. I think the crowd might have spooked one or two, but our two riders handled the horses very well,\" he said.</p> <p>The same horses will be used in the women's final on Friday, by which time they may be a little more used to the roar of the crowd. It could also play to Britain's advantage. Heather Fell, who goes into that competition with a real chance of a medal, is a superb horsewoman. If the animals play up again she will be one of the riders best equipped to deal with them.<br></p>",
  "<p>The only time the pupils of class 4K feel free is when they are lost in the sensual pleasures of hip-hop, sex or violence. For the rest of the time, they are trapped not just in their classroom, a place so desolate that even the teachers refuse to visit, but in a society that has hopelessly let them down. Nigel Williams' shocking 1970s play about a London school has - in this production by Bosnia's East West Theatre Company - been relocated to modern-day Sarajevo, making the pupils children of the war.</p> <p>This updating, by Haris Pasovic, is subtle but significant. Most apparent is the switch from a single-sex boys' school to a mixed class of pubescent teenagers, none of whom - male or female - can go for long without referring to masturbation or making lewd, often violent, approaches to one another. On one level, this is just the usual hormonal excess of teenagers, but on another, it's an indication that sexuality is all these deprived youngsters have to call their own.</p> <p>Implicit in the production is the memory of the collapse of Yugoslavia. One student talks about the poverty he has endured since his father was killed in the war, another about the social malaise that has attracted him to Islamic extremism, and a third about the racial abuse she has suffered as a result of being a Christian Serb living in Muslim Bosnia. Such details give a sense of urgency to Williams' script, making more plausible the thesis that a dysfunctional society will produce a generation for whom violence is the only viable means of expression.</p> <p>For all the desk-throwing, glue-sniffing and menacing behaviour, these children are caged animals. Despite their frightening physical power, they show the neurotic mannerisms of confinement, forever rocking, twitching and hugging themselves. Amar Selimovic's formidable Iron is the class ringleader, yet the way he paces the room and drums his head on the desks shows a deeply damaged individual. At the heart of the play is the clash between Iron's nihilism and the humanism of Maja Zeco's Cobra who, against the odds, clings to her belief in positive action.</p> <p>The more it becomes apparent that \"we've all been abandoned the day we were born\", the more the violence escalates, leading to a gun-toting finale that would be laughably melodramatic if it were not also a symbolic reminder that there is where social breakdown leads.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1.30pm</strong> After two days under varying shades of grey, blue skies appaeared over the Rose Bowl this morning, <em>reports Mike Averis</em>, but the start was still delayed by 30 minutes - hence the late lunch - while the Blotter soaked up the puddles on the covers caused by overnight rain and the wicket got a decent airing.</p> <p>With Nottinghamshire and Durham sitting this round out, but 71 overs lost in the first two days, Somerset had to push on, but were held up initially by some steady bowling from James Tomlinson, leading wicket-taker in the first division, and Dimitri Mascarenhas. Tomlinson added two more victims - Arul Suppiah, surprised to be given lbw and Zander de Bruyn, who dragged on the fifth ball he facesd - but it was the new boy in the Hampshire ranks, 18-year-old Liam Dawson, who struck the biggest blow of the morning, having Marcus Trescothick caught for 65.</p> <p>Dawson, playing only his second championship match of the season, had undergone quite a rigorous examination from the former England batsman - as had most of the bowlers - and Trescothick appeared to be gliding along quite nicely. The only half chance was an edge well wide of slip off Imran Tahir and Trescothick, was adding to his overnight 19 with increasing confidence in the company of James Hildreth.</p> <p>That edge had brought up his seventh half century of the season - to add to the three 100s - and Dawson had just been put into the crowd at long on when Trescothick mistimed a sweep in the same over, giving Chris Benham all the time in the world to get under the ball at mid-wicket. By lunch, Somerset were 144 for three, still 168 short but with Hildreth still pushing on, 45 not out.</p> <p><strong>2.03pm</strong> Lancashire are up against it here, at eight for three at lunch after Kent had scored 283, reports <em>Paul Weaver at Canterbury</em>. And it is worse than that because Stuart Law, the captain, is suffering back spasms and has been unable to bat so far. \"We're working on him and we hope he will bat this afternoon,\" cricket manager Mike Watkinson said. \"It only happened this morning.\" They need Law now like they rarely have.</p> <p>This is a really competitive game which both sides badly need to win. Kent resumed this morning on 241 for six with Geraint Jones unbeaten on 80. Lancashire broke through in the third over of the morning when Amjad Khan was late on one from Glen Chapple and was lbw, without addition, for 16. That was 246 for eight and there was then a useful stand of 33 between Jones and Robbie Joseph, who also made 16 before he fell to Dominic Cork.</p> <p>Jones continued to play some excellent shots, driving especially well when Sajid Mahmood pitched it up. He reached his sixth career century for Kent and his seventh in all but he has yet to pass 108. He had got 106 here when he was last lbw padding up. When Lancashire batted the much improved Joseph bowled Paul Horton middle stump first ball, via the inside edge. And in Joseph's next over he had the returning Mal Loye caught at slip. That was two for two and it was six for three when Mark Chilton was beaten for pace and was lbw to Amjad.</p> <p><strong>4.15pm</strong> Somerset finally made it to the top of the first division, but how long they stay there for is anyone's guess, <em>reports Mike Averis</em>. With just four sessions left in the game they are still 65 behind with four first innings wickets standing and, so far, the wicket that was expected to favour spin - and Imran Tahir- is still behaving itself.</p> <p>There is the odd low bounce, but it takes a considerable leap of imagination to see either side winning from here, especially with more showers predicted.</p> <p>The Pakistani wrist spinner, who came into the match with 22 wickets from his first three matches for Hampshire and three \"five fors\", is into his 26th over and - but for the wicket of Carl Kieswetter, caught bat-pad on the stroke of a delayed tea - would have been underwhelmed by his performance.</p> <p>There have been far too many loose deliveries, one of which claimed the wicket of Wes Durston when Somerset were on the brink of 200 and the batting point which took them ahead of Nottinghamshire. Durston simply swept and missed an over pitched ball as he and Ian Blackwell looked to up the pace.</p> <p>By tea Blackwell was on 52, the third Somerset batsman to reach a half century. Marcus Trescothick fell to Liam Dawson before lunch and the 18-year-old also got rid of James Hildreth, run out by athletic fielding and a direct hit from cover point.</p> <p><strong>5 pm</strong> Kent are batting again here even though, after bowling out Lancashire for a miserable 125 in 36.5 overs to gain a first innings lead of 158, they were entitled to enforce the follow-on.</p> <p>There is more than two days left in this match but it was still a surprise that Rob Key, the Kent captain, did not decide to bowl again. His bowlers are only just warmed up and there is rain forecast tomorrow and Saturday. Especially Saturday. Key is normally a good captain but on this occasion his decision-making has been about as good as Lancashire's batting.</p> <p>The most impressive bowler today has been Robbie Joseph, 26, who must be in line for an England Lions tour after a number of impressive performances this summer. There's nothing new about Joseph - Kent first spotted him ten years ago - but it is only this season that he has looked the part.</p> <p>This has been the good side of Key's captaincy. He has really backed the fast bowler this season and the bowler has been one of the sharpest on the circuit as a result. But it was the considerably older Martin Saggers who ended the Lancashire innings by taking the last four wickets.</p> <p>After lunch, Francois Du Plessis edged to third slip and when Luke Sutton was caught at first Lancashire were 32-5. Steven Croft was lbw to Joseph without offering a stroke and then Law, who came in at eight, was caught behind as he pushed forward.</p> <p>Cork was lbw first ball and when Gary Keedy clipped a ball from Saggers to square-leg Lancashire, at 79-9, looked a shambles. It improved when Mahmood (33) and Chapple (44) added 46 for the last wicket in just 4.3 overs. They failed to avoid the follow-on figure by nine runs but in the end it didn't matter.</p> <p>Key has just got out and Kent are 14-1. Key didn't look happy with the decision. But he shouldn't have been batting anyway.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson's plans for the legacy use of the Olympic stadium in Stratford look like undermining Britain's standing in international sport once again.</p> <p>Talks over what configuration the main 2012 stadium will have after the Olympics are increasingly distant from a pledge made to the Olympic and athletics governing bodies in 2005. The bid book delivered to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore in 2005 promised it, and the International Association of Athletics Federations, that London would maintain a fit-for-purpose athletics stadium in its East End.</p> <p>But Johnson, the mayor of London whose London Development Agency has final say over post-Games use of facilities, admitted today that the athletics usage might not transpire. </p> <p>\"I will not dilate for a long time on the legacy prospects of the stadium,\" said Johnson. \"But this is still a story that is not closed; we should look at it and continue to explore all options. There has been considerable private-sector investment into the Bird's Nest [Olympic stadium in Beijing] and the investors hold a 30-year lease over the structure. This is something interesting. There are issues to do with their managing to attract football to the stadium but so far we have failed to do that in London.\"</p> <p>The IOC and IAAF trust Stratford's stadium will become a compact, 25,000-seat facility that can hold athletics meets at full capacity. But Britain could become an international pariah again if renewed plans gather pace to bolt an athletics track on to what would be a larger football stadium. Athletics could only ever fill a 40,000-plus-seat venue to capacity during an Olympics; otherwise it would stand half empty.</p> <p>London's Singapore promise was in itself an attempt to assuage opposition from within the powerful IAAF after London had to withdraw from its hosting of the 2005 world athletics championship over the collapse of the Pickett's Lock stadium project. But since taking over as London's mayor from Ken Livingstone, Johnson has repeatedly insisted cost-savings must be made around the Olympics. And the insertion of a football tenant would certainly be the most viable option.</p> <p>\"It is very, very important to remember that we won the Games at a time of economic plenty and that we must deliver it against a background of a credit crunch, a downturn and a possible recession,\" said Johnson. \"We are seeking economies where we can but that does not mean this will be a penny-pinching, austerity Games. Very considerable savings are being made.\"</p> <p>Discussions have not yet been held with the most obvious tenancy candidate, West Ham United, the local football club in the borough of Newham.</p>",
  "<p>So near and yet not quite. Woodside High, in Haringey, north London, one of 638 \"underperforming\" schools will reach the government's 30% threshold for A* to C grades if three students succeed in their appeals over results.</p> <p>Like the other schools on the list of National Challenge schools it will be closed or turned into an academy unless it reaches 30% by 2010 education secretary Ed Balls has threatened. Despite improving results the announcement undermined confidence among parents and led to a steep fall in applications for the new academic year.</p> <p>Today the school's 223 GCSE students achieved 28% A* to Cs. </p> <p>This will rise to the \"magic 30%\" that lifts it out of the underperforming category if markers boost three pupils' grades, says headteacher Joan McVittie.</p> <p>But by all accounts, this school is to be admired. Last year, just 17% of pupils achieved five A* to C grades, including maths and English.</p> <p>Half the school's pupils are on free school meals, four-fifths have English as an additional language and the intake on entry is at least one year behind the national average for most of its pupils.</p> <p>Oh, and in the last year, its sports hall burnt down and half its GCSE students were forced to sit this summer's exams in a portable building.</p> <p>Despite this, today was a cause for celebration for many Woodside pupils, including Canan Topcu, 16, from Tottenham.</p> <p>Canan achieved five As, three A*s, six Bs and four Cs and will now study biology, chemistry, maths and psychology A-levels at City and Islington College in September.</p> <p>She hopes to become a doctor. \"I'm so relieved and so happy,\" she says. \"I just remembered all the mistakes I had made before I got the results this morning.\"</p> <p>Woodside is in the underperforming category because some pupils don't take revision seriously enough, not because the school is failing them, Canan believes.</p> <p>Benjamin Biri, 16, from Tottenham came to Woodside three years ago from Canada. He achieved two As, four Bs and seven Cs today and will start a BTec national diploma in e-gaming at City and Islington College in September. He wants to be a computer programmer.</p> <p>\"I feel really relieved. I'm going to go and tell all my friends now,\" he says.<br>Stavroulla Flourentzou, 16, from Wood Green hardly had time to open her results this morning - four As, two Bs and three Cs - before rushing back to her summer job as a secretary in Bounds Green. She'll study A-levels in law, English language and literature and sociology and philosophy at City and Islington College in September. \"This school has been great for me,\" she says. \"If you want to learn, you will. It's down to the individual.\"</p> <p>This morning may have been a worrying time for Woodside's GCSE pupils as they queued to receive their results, but it was all the more so for McVittie, who took on the headship of Woodside two years ago.</p> <p>In the last year, she has been so worried about being in the underperforming category, she has been checking a pensions website to see what could happen to her if she was forced to leave.</p> <p>Parents, staff and pupils have also been fretting. \"The number of parents who want to come to us for their child's secondary education has dropped,\" she says. \"I've had to do numerous assemblies assuring pupils that their school wasn't going to close mid-year. My staff have been anxious having been told by colleagues in other schools that they were in danger of losing their jobs.\"</p> <p>The improvement in GCSE results is down to the students, a motivated staff and the tens of thousands of pounds she has received from London Challenge, which supports struggling secondaries, McVittie believes. Part of London Challenge, Education London, has sent in consultants to help teachers, which she says has been very useful.</p> <p>\"If we don't make the 30%, I don't think anything will happen immediately,\" she says. \"If I have shown that we are making progress, which we certainly are, we will continue to be supported.\"</p> <p>\"The future of this school is very bright,\" says Shane Carey, a teacher in business, maths and ICT at Woodside. \"An academy is not needed here.\"</p> <h2>Related article</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/21/gcses.schools2\">Make or break day for named and shamed schools</a></p>",
  "<p>\"A federal judge in San Jose [Jeremy Fogel] handed a victory to fair-use advocates today, refusing to dismiss a lawsuit that a Pennsylvania woman filed after Universal Music Publishing forced YouTube to remove a video of her children cavorting to an old Prince hit,\" reports the <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/08/prince-fair-use.html\">LA Times technology blog</a>.</p> <p>In this case: \"The legal skirmish centers on a 29-second video that Stephanie Lenz posted to YouTube last year that features her then-13-month-old son racing around the kitchen. The video includes a decidedly low-fi recording of Prince's Let's Go Crazy.\"</p> <p>At the moment, the ideal solution for giant copyright owners is to use automated software to check sites, then fire off takedown orders. If a human being had to make a \"fair use\" judgment about every single image, music or video file, this would involve a lot of work, and in many cases, the cost could be prohibitive.</p> <p>However, that may not be how the case turns out. The post says:</p> <blockquote> <p>But even if Fogel's decision goes unchallenged, the prohibition may be difficult to enforce. That's because, as Fogel noted, proving the kind of misrepresentation claim that Lenz is pursuing requires a plaintiff to show the copyright holder knew it was making a groundless claim of infringement (ie, it was acting in \"subjective bad faith\"). It's not what Universal should have known about the video, but what it actually knew.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the other hand, some companies may not be quite as dimwitted as Universal Music Publishing, which would have been better off regarding Lenz's \"crime\" as a valuable piece of promotional material. This is already happening on YouTube, where new Video ID software identifies videos that appear to infringe copyright. Instead of removing these (often popular) videos, the copyright owner can \"claim\" them. The LA Times story, <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/08/youtube-and-the.html\">YouTube and the irrepressible dream of Video ID</a>, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>By \"claiming\" the user-submitted copy of their content, they effectively take ownership of it and from then on can use it to glean demographic information about who's watching or even to sell advertising alongside the video and divvy up the proceeds with YouTube.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is also a good solution for the Google-owned YouTube, which has been wary of putting adverts on videos that infringe copyrights, and which therefore isn't making any money out of hosting them.</p>",
  "<p>Revellers are set to hold a party in London's Hyde Park next week in protest at the rising number of bans on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugsandalcohol\">drinking</a> in public places.</p> <p>Organised by civil liberties campaign group the Manifesto Club, the mass <a href=\"http://www.manifestoclub.com/boozebancampaign\">bank holiday picnic</a> is being promoted on the internet and a number of social networking sites, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/facebook\">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>The club claims that local authority-imposed drinking bans are infantilising and go beyond their legal remit.</p> <p>But Home Office statistics show that nearly half of all violent crime is linked to alcohol. Drinking in public is now restricted in 613 places in England and Wales.</p> <p>James Panton, a Manifesto Club founder, said: \"The picnic is an attempt to reclaim public space. Alcohol bans are the result of a top-down, bureaucratic definition of public space, and an over-the-top response to perceived antisocial behaviour and social breakdown.</p> <p>\"The longer these bans are imposed, the more each of us refuse to take responsibility for public space, and stop resolving our own issues, leading to a more antisocial society. This is not a campaign for drunkenness, it's for the public right to engage in our own space.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The police should be concerned with people breaking the law, not with these so-called preventative measures. Cultural issues are not solved with blanket bans, but by political and social engagement for which we need a vibrant public sphere.\"</p> <p>The event, dubbed a provocation picnic, follows a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/02/transport.ukcrime\">drinks party held on the Circle line</a> in May to mark the last night of legal drinking on the tube, which was also publicised via a viral campaign. The night ended with 17 arrests and assaults on seven London Underground staff.</p> <p>And last month a waterfight in Hyde Park, promoted on Facebook, also descended into violence when a woman was punched to the floor and nine people arrested, including four for alleged assaults on police.</p> <p>But Panton insisted the picnic would be peaceful. </p> <p>\"We want to raise awareness, and are expecting to attract people who are annoyed at this fundamental civil liberties issue,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens, but it's a bank holiday \u2013 all over London people will be getting drunk. Most will not be causing any trouble.\"</p> <p>The head of the charity Alcohol Concern defended councils' use of drinking bans. </p> <p>Don Shenkey, the charity's chief executive, said they were an important tool in the fight against antisocial and destructive behaviour linked to alcohol. </p> <p>He added: \"Residents in communities around the country rate this is as one of the issues they'd most like to see dealt with. By prohibiting drinking in public spaces local authorities are able send a strong signal to the minority of irresponsible adults and teenagers who take things too far and reclaim public spaces for the enjoyment of the entire community.</p> <p>\"The aim of these powers is not to criminalise drinkers or drink itself, but rather to give police added enforcement powers to seize alcohol from those posing a nuisance to those around you. They are only a potential option and in most cases tend to employed in a limited targeted manner after it has been established that a specific area poses particular problems for the community.\"</p>",

He fired five shots at the 40-year-old former Beatle outside the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan's Upper West Side, hitting him four times. Lennon was shot down in front of his wife, Yoko Ono.</p> <p>Chapman, 53, said he had come to realise the gravity of what he did and how it affected Lennon's wife and children. \"I recognised that that 25-year-old man, I don't think he really appreciated the life that he was taking, that this was a human being,\" he said. \"I feel now at 53 I have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is. I have changed a lot.\"</p> <p>He said that contrary to press reports, he did not call Lennon's name before shooting him. \"I don't recall saying 'Mr Lennon','' he said.</p> <p>\"I think that was something the press elaborated on. That didn't happen. He didn't turn. I shot him in the back.''</p> <p>The former maintenance man from Hawaii said he shot Lennon because he wanted notoriety and fame to counter his feelings of failure.</p> <p>He began planning the shooting three months earlier, after seeing Lennon on the cover of the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album.</p> <p>''I just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together, the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody,'' he said.</p> <p>\"And I said, 'Wouldn't it be something if I killed this individual?

  "<p>There are worse ways of finding out about a country than looking at its book charts. For instance, strange as it may seem, Takiji Kobayashi's Marxism-inspired Kani Kosen is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/japan\">a bestseller in Japan</a> at the moment, 79 years after it was first published. But given the currently bleak economic climate in the country, you can see why a story about the struggles of poor labourers might be appealing reading.</p> <p>Looking at the UK book market, meanwhile, is a good way to obliterate any idea of the Brits being sophisticated, stiff-upper-lip types. For one, it appears we're completely incapable of thinking for ourselves and making any decisions without Richard and Judy telling us to - two-thirds of the bestselling fiction titles of the year thus far are written by authors who've appeared on the daytime duo's sofa. We follow the trends of the US (see Stephenie Meyer, Kim Edwards, James Patterson, William Young et al). We're obsessed with reading \"real life\" tales of other people's misery (financial rather than economic at the moment, but check the charts again next year). And, for everyone else, there's those books \"written\" (ahem) by people off the telly.</p> <p>In America, it seems, you've really got to be cultivating your \"spiritual\" side. Oprah Winfrey, for instance, wants you to buy Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose. And, based on sales, more than three million Americans are duly awakening. Meanwhile, William Young's self-published religious novel, The Shack, has sold almost a million copies this year, while pastors and preachers like Rick Warren, Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer and Lee Strobel have all sold comfortably into five figures. Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray Love has also done incredibly well publication - it has \"pray\" in the title - and for those not wanting to commit themselves to one religion, there's always Rhonda Byrne's The Secret.</p> <p>What can be said of the Irish is that they are a patriotic bunch, with the likes of Ireland-born Cathy Kelly, Maeve Binchy, Sheila O'Flanagan and Marian Keyes never straying too far from the bestseller lists.</p> <p>Melbourne has just been named as <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/melbourne-hooks-the-books-20080819-3y9b.html?page=-1\">the Unesco City of Literature</a>, but I'd be very nervous about using the phrase \"literature\" to describe what's on the Australian bestseller charts. They just can't get enough of their Mills &amp; Boon, and love Nora Roberts almost as much as the Americans do. It seems the Australian public are a romantic bunch, and with Shane Warne's exploits with the ladies much publicised in the UK tabloids, there's evidence to support it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, although <a href=\"http://www.southafrica.info/business/economy/development/lfs-280308.htm\">South African unemployment rates are falling</a>, there's still hundreds of people after some cheap financial advice, choosing Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T Kiyosaki with alarming regularity.</p> <p>In France, highbrow literary fiction cracks the top 10 on a regular basis, Marc Levy in particular. Although many a thought-provoker may have occupied non-fiction bestseller lists earlier this year, the French currently can't get enough of collections of old-school brain teasers and assorted tests, while the current popularity of the book General Culture for Dummies suggests the stereotype of the French as an enlightened bunch may just be a ruse.</p> <p>In Germany, there's little room for celebrities or light-hearted works, with philosophical tomes Wer bin Ich? and Ein Mann - Ein Buch selling well. But the biggest success story this year is Feuchtgebiete, which has topped the fiction charts since March and is incredibly graphic. The novel was the talk of the London Book Fair earlier this year, and UK rights were eventually snapped up by Fourth Estate after a fierce bidding war.</p> <p>I'm not sure you'll want to know what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuchtgebiete\">Feuchtgebiete</a> means, or indeed what it reveals about Germany.</p>",

We came here in a hurry to help civilians and Russian citizens and it will take as long as it takes,\" he said.</p> <p>The spokesman said Georgia had misrepresented the ceasefire deal signed by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and that under those terms Russia could station peacekeepers in Georgia indefinitely</p> <p>\"They [the Georgians] are perverting the agreement.

Reuters news agency reported 21 tanks, rocket launchers and armoured cars moved north through the Roki tunnel that separates the Ossetia region from Russia.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Russians appeared to be strengthening their grip. Troops were seen today digging trenches and setting up mortars around the western Georgian port of Poti.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said that Russian manoeuvres reflected \"some kind of deception game\".</p> <p>\"They don't show any sign that they want to give up control,\" he told a news conference in Tbilisi. \"It looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people.\" </p> <p>Aid agencies have been trying to reach an estimated 159,000 people displaced by the conflict. The UN high commissioner for refugees reported today that 15,000 people in western Georgia were \"in dire need of assistance\" and cut off from the capital, Tbilisi.</p> <p>Nato's special envoy for the Caucasus and central Asia, Bob Simmons, arrived in Tbilisi today for talks with the government over deepening cooperation with the alliance. He was accompanied by a team of specialists in civil emergency planning to help Georgia deal with its immediate humanitarian needs, but Simmons will also be discussing the rebuilding of Georgia's armed forces and the path to full Nato membership.</p> <p>Georgia's deputy foreign minister, Giga Bokeria, welcomed comments made yesterday by David Miliband, Britain's foreign secretary, saying the formal process leading to Nato membership had already begun. </p> <p>Bokeria told the Guardian that the Russian occupation had backfired and accelerated Georgia's progress towards Nato. But he said Georgia had suffered as a result of earlier Nato indecision over its membership potential.</p> <p>\"Some European states made an honest mistake not to make a clear and ambiguous signal to Russia, and Georgia has paid the price,\" Bokeria said.</p>",
  "<p>Dear Julie,</p> <p>I'm glad you're writing about your <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/religion.anglicanism\">Christian faith</a>. Yours is the sort of voice that will help to shake things up a bit, make people question some of the media cliches surrounding religion. (Cliches exemplified by <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/09/television.television?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">the grim</a> reality show <a href=\" http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/makechristian.html\">Make me a Christian</a>.) You're not known for piety, and that's a good thing. The majority view is that religious believers are timid conformists \u2013 alas there's some truth to this, but you're right to say that the smuggest conformists of all are the atheists. As I've said here before, I think their smugness is rooted in <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/06/atheismispretentiousandcow \">intellectual cowardice</a>.</p> <p>I expect lots of the thousand comments on your article ticked you off for boasting about your voluntary work. I think it was justified to mention this: if your faith has led you to get more involved in your local community, why not say so? (In fact, reading your article reminded me to volunteer for a new local community project \u2013 so a bit of peer-pressure is sometimes a good thing, to get us off our arses.)</p> <p>I like your concluding comments \u2013 yes, Christianity is a huge undertaking that feels impossible, rather than a smugly possessed \"identity\" \u2013 and yes, it is also something to be excited about, to \"love\".</p> <p>But I want to add a few caveats to my general thumbs-up. These are not criticisms but caveats \u2013 respectful bits of advice to take care over certain things, intended in a spirit of Christian fellowship.</p> <p>I sympathise with your advocacy of Protestantism rather than Catholicism, and yet I wonder if it's meaningful in itself. \"Protestantism\" is too broad a thing to advocate. It includes evangelical fundamentalists and wet liberals. One has to try to articulate what sort of Protestantism one means. You hint that the Church of England is at present a bit wet for your liking. Where are you going with this? Please don't become an edgier Anne Atkins! What is it that makes Roman Catholicism \"wretched\" in your eyes? If it's the emphasis on rules, then please note that hardline Protestantism suffers from a different version of the same disease. If it's a liberal version of Protestantism that appeals to you, don't be ashamed of saying so, for fear of seeming wet. Don't fall for the trap of thinking that \"real\" Christians must have the guts to advocate some form of authoritarian institution.</p> <p>Also, I sympathise with your observation that Richard Dawkins is wrong to lump Christianity and Islam together. But \u2013 whoah! \u2013 let's tread carefully here. If there's one monotheism that stands out from the three, it's not Islam for being violent: it's Christianity for being non-violent.</p> <p>Don't forget that Judaism and Islam are structurally similar \u2013 they are political and military in origin, and they have a law at their heart. Christianity is the odd one out.</p> <p>Finally, if you're an Anglican, please be more honest about the current crisis. Do you or do you not agree with the current policy that discriminates against homosexuals? Please don't wave this aside as a petty irrelevance. Your suggestion that the church might be better off under Bishops Sentamu or Nazir-Ali implies that you'd like to see a more strongly conservative line. Really?</p> <p>And there are other awkward issues that an Anglican ought to face. Do you agree with its education policy? Does it bother you that a good few of your fellow worshippers are trying to get little Charlie and Lola into a good school? Do you defend the church's establishment, the presence of bishops in the House of Lords?</p> <p>These aren't little liberal-guilt issues, fuelled by atheist propaganda, they are the issues that give Christianity a bad name among liberals, and hand the atheists easy victories. We have to think about them. If we are trying to advocate Christianity with new sharpness, we can't fall back on the same old Anglican evasions.</p> <p>Yours faithfully,</p> <p>Theo</p>",

Today we have Exhibit B, this new ad going after McCain for not fully investigating, as the relevant Senate committee chairman, Jack Abramoff and Ralph Reed's disgusting swindling of Native American tribes over their casino gambling interests. Read the background and basic facts <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=\" abramoff-reed_indian_gambling_scandal\" \">here</a>.</p> <p>The very sentence I just wrote tells you the basic problem with the ad. Notice that after the words \"going after McCain for\u2026,\" I had to write another 25 words. And I described the situation about as economically as it can be described. You ought to be able to explain attacks more quickly than that. Eight or 10 words, or thereabouts. Obama \"opposes new drilling while Americans are paying through the nose for gasoline.\" That's 12 words. Much better.</p> <p>Anyway. The strategic errors in this ad are two.</p> <p>First: It assumes a great deal of knowledge on the viewer's part. It assumes that the viewer knows a) who Ralph Reed is, b) why he's a bad actor, c) that he was involved in ripping off Indian tribes and d) that he should have been investigated more completely. Now I note that this ad is running only in Reed's home state of Georgia, where he is pretty well-known. But even in Georgia, what percentage of likely voters knows all this\u2014half? 60 percent? Don't underestimate the average person's ability to forget political details from three years ago. </p> <p>Second: Mr. Axelrod seems to have forgotten his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Westen\">Drew Westen</a>. The ad appeals to reason, not emotion. Is McCain's failure to call Reed to testify really something that grabs a viewer by the gut and packs an emotional punch? Not by a light year. To be moved by this ad emotionally, you have to care passionately about\u2026congressional testimony!</p> <p>By contrast imagine this ad: photographs of poor, shoeless Native American children. Forlorn Native American music, with lonely drums and the call of the noble eagle. A voiceover quickly explaining how these children and millions like them were swindled by these fat cats. Then you cut to pictures of the fat cats. You show Abramoff's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usqSZheeWdE&amp;feature=related\">old restaurant</a>, where he and his pals dined on $40 steaks and drank $150 cognacs (I mean per glass), with speakeasy-ragtime music as your backdrop. </p> <p>You go back to the poor Indian kids. Then you show a nasty-looking picture of McCain. Voiceover: \"And John McCain, when he had the chance, didn't do a thing about it. You don't want four more years of this.\"</p> <p>That's emotions, issues and character. It ain't neurosurgery. Really. I coulda made millions.</p>",

  "<p>From his hospital bed, Alfredo Jes\u00fas Acosta Mendiola was calling out for his parents.</p> <p>The eight-year-old was one of the youngest of the 19 survivors of yesterday's plane crash at Madrid's Barajas airport in which 153 passengers and crew lost their lives.</p> <p>Alfredo's father, Alfredo Acosta Sierra, died in the crash and the body of his mother, G Rodriguez Mendiola, has not been identified.</p> <p>One of three children in hospital, Alfredo was dragged from the wreckage of the burning plane by emergency workers and suffered only a broken leg.</p> <p>Doctors at Madrid's Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas hospital, where Alfredo was being treated, described his condition as \"good\".</p> <p>One airport worker, who gave her name only as Maria, helped in Alfredo's rescue. </p> <p>\"He is in a good condition, knows what is happening. He is just asking for his parents,\" she said.</p> <p>Four of the survivors were in a critical condition and another six were in a serious condition. Investigators were searching for the remains of two others near the crash site.</p> <p>Other survivors told how they escaped death. Ligia Palomino, 41, a Colombian who fled her own country after her journalist mother received threats, said she heard strange noises as the plane took off.</p> <p>Palomino, who now lives in Madrid, suffered a broken right leg. She told El Pais newspaper: \"I grabbed the arm of my partner, Jose, and looked at Gema, my sister-in-law. Then the plane came to a sharp stop. I heard a horrible noise. I was thrown forward.\"</p> <p>She was half unconscious when an \"enormous explosion\" woke her and the plane caught fire. \"I reached for Jose, put out my hand to touch him. I saw what looked like a doll, which fell on the ground. I realised this person was dead. I knew it wasn't Jose.\"</p> <p>Palomino, a doctor who works for the emergency services, said she felt an enormous heat. All around her others were crying and pleading for help.</p> <p>When emergency workers arrived, Palomino recognised them as her colleagues. She had been travelling to Gran Canaria to spend a week's holiday and celebrate her 42nd birthday next Sunday.</p> <p>Among the other survivors was Anna Stefanides, 56, a Swedish laboratory technician who is in a serious condition in hospital with multiple injuries.</p> <p>She had travelled to Spain from her home in Norway to see friends. Today, her husband, a doctor, was travelling to Madrid to be at her bedside.</p> <p>Among relatives of the victims, there was mounting anger amid suggestions the plane had suffered problems just before flight.</p> <p>\"I'd kill the bastard who did this,\" a man shouted at Spanish state television cameras outside a makeshift morgue where families were gathering to identify the remains of relatives.</p> <p>Another person said: \"Knowing the plane was bad - it took off with my seven-year-old niece.\"</p> <p>Spanair says it does not know the cause of the crash. It says the pilot of the US-built MD-82 airliner initially reported a problem with a gauge that measures temperature outside the plane. This delayed the takeoff.</p> <p>The plane then crashed at the end of the runway during the second takeoff attempt, burning and largely disintegrating.</p> <p>The Spanish newspaper El Pais says one of the two engines failed and may have caught fire during takeoff.</p> <p>Spanair confirmed an MD-82 was forced to make an emergency landing last Saturday on a flight from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands to Madrid because of problems with both of its engines. The plane landed on the nearby island of Gran Canaria, the destination of yesterday's flight.</p> <p>A company official said he did not know if the same plane was involved in both cases.</p> <p>Identifying the bodies may take days. Only 37 have so far been formally identified. So far, no Britons have been named either as victims or survivors.</p> <p>Spanair chartered a plane from the Canary Islands to fly in relatives of people killed in the crash.</p>",

It happens in Afghanistan too ... But not to me.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said he believed that coalition forces were making \"substantial advances\" against the Taliban. </p> <p>\"We have succeeded in winning back territory. The longer term solution is that more power will be given to the Afghanistan people.\" </p> <p>Earlier the prime minister told British troops at Camp Bastion: \"You are the heroes of our country ... You are the frontline against the Taliban ... What you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of Britain.\" </p> <p>The 300 or so troops who gathered in the 39C heat at 9.30am local time (6am BST) stood emotionless as Brown told them: \"This week we are celebrating the Olympics, where we have had great success. People have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground. </p> <p>\"But this week also I believe that our Olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage, professionalism and dedication. You make our country proud every day of the week, every week of the year. You are truly the heroes of our country. </p> <p>\"I wish to say how proud I am of you today.\" </p> <p>Morale at the main UK hub in Helmand was said to be high. During Brown's 90-minute visit, the troops from 16 Air Assault Brigade, made up of 2 and 3 Battalion Parachute Regiment, 5 Battalion Royal Regiment Scotland and the Royal Irish regiment, seemed in good humour. </p> <p>Brown said afterwards: \"Morale among the troops is very strong. They are gradually extending the area which we control. We are also making great progress in training the Afghan army. The government is determined to stamp out lawlessness.\" </p> <p>Captain Phil Hobbs of 7 Armoured Company based in Germany, said that the prime minister's visit did have a positive effect on the troops. </p> <p>\"It shows we do have support for what we are doing,\" he said. \"It gives us a sense of pride.\" </p> <p>If the troops still have complaints about their equipment, they did not mention them. One told how tents previously occupied by eight people were now being used by 14 because troops were in mid-rotation and those due to replace them in the field had already arrived. </p> <p>On the upside, he said, the tents were air conditioned so the arrangement was manageable. </p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel David Reynolds, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: \"In the UK, all you see is young men dying out here. The sacrifice they make is stability back home. That is why we are here.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Afternoon everyone</strong> How goes?</p> <p><strong>That good, eh?</strong> I've just trooped across the way from my hotel, down the expressway, over the skinny footbridge, in between the crowd surrounding the ticket touts, through the security check, around the Olympic park, on past the ticket check, into the media area and down to a seat near the front of the lower tier, about three-quarters of the way up the 100m track and 10 metres back from the barriers.</p> <p><strong>Walking through the Olympic park</strong>, which I'm sure you've seen in the background of countless sideways glances at life around Beijing by Adrian Chiles on the BBC, is akin to listening Kraftwerk cover Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. Anyway, how is the Beeb's coverage back home? I'm not used to watching the Olympics without Inverdale, Barker and Brendon Foster guiding me through it. Any highlights? One thing I would like to have seen would have been Michael Johnson's post race commentary on Usain Bolt's two world records. I have just caught a quick dose of Jon Edwards, who is whispering excitedly to a colleague of his about ten yards behind me. Edwards' view: \"I mean, we're third in the medal table, that never happens!\"</p> <p><strong>It's going to be a fantastic night</strong>, starting in ten minutes time with the three heats PHILLIPS of the Women's 1500m IDOWU and then moving on to the Women's 200m Final at <strong>12.30pm BST.</strong> , A huge PHILLIPS head-to-head between IDOWU the USA and Jamaica, then we've the three 800m semi-finals, the first two heats of both PHILLIPS the Women's and the IDOWU Men's 4x100m, then, at <strong>2.20pm BST</strong>, and the Men's 400m final with Jeremy Wariner looking to beat Micheal Johnson's <em>other</em> unbeatable PHILLIPS record, and then there's the Men's IDOWU 110m hurdles final at <strong>2.40pm</strong>. Oh yes, and there's Britain's Goldie Sayers in the Women's Javelin from <strong>12.20pm</strong> and somebody called Phillips Idowu in the Men's triple jump final from <strong>1.25pm</strong> Apparently he has quite a good chance of a medal.</p> <p><strong>7.05pm</strong> and it's started. Bahrain's Maryam Jamal winning the first 1500m heat in 4.05.14. The top three in each heat are going through to the final, along with the three fastest qualifiers. GB's Susan Scott (yes, I know it didn't say that last time you looked...) goes in the next race, and Lisa Dobriskey in the third. Neither are among the three fastest this season in their races, so it may be tight.</p> <p>AndyinBrum: the Chinese crowd in the stadium are all, I'd say, middle class citizens. The tickets are certainly too expensive for a lot of Beijingers.</p> <p><strong>7.10pm</strong> Anyone care to bet as to how many medals Britain will, or may, win tonight and what colour? Here's your cast list: Goldie Sayers, Idowu and Larry Achike, Martyn Rooney. I'm already more drinks than I'd care to consume in hock to my colleague Mike Adamson, he having had the good reasoning to disagree with me when I said that Phelps wouldn't beat Spitz's record and then that Bolt wouldn't beat Johnson's. Susan Scott has been badly run out of this I'm afraid, she was up with the leaders for a couple of laps, and... oh hang on ... Scott kicks strongly in the home straight and finishes fourth in 4.14.65. I'm not sure that'll be enough to get her through.</p> <p><strong>The javelin throwers are being introduced</strong> by the ballpark style voice over guy. Just wait for hi to struggle with Onochie 'Larry' Achike's name later on. Seriously, it's great, when he has to say an Arabic name they over-dub him a different voice so they get the pronounciation right. Goldie Sayers, red in the face, gives a friendly wave. There's a Chinese thrower, Zhang Li, in the field, so there's a tremendous roar for her. And I've just found out that my, ah, hunch, was correct. The top six finishers in the first 1500m heat were all quicker than Susan Scott, so she's out.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm</strong> I've somehow ended up sitting in the L'Equipe tribune. I'm surrounded by people in horn-rimmed glasses and scarves. Again, a brilliant finish from Lisa Dobriskey, sprinting home at a furious lick and overtaking the USA's Shannon Rowbury to finish third and qualify automatically for the final. In fact she's the third fastest qualifier, which bodes well.</p> <p><strong>7.30PM</strong>. Goldie Sayers steps to the end of the javelin runway, a little put out perhaps that already two women have thrown further than her own PB. Her first effort isn't too shabby though, going out to 65m. Right, no dawdling, it's time for the women's 200m final. What a race this is. Jamaica are going for a clean sweep of all the sprint golds, and even a repeat of their 1-2-3 in the women's 100m. In the way of Veronica Campbell-Brown (the Olympic champion), Kerron Stewart and Sherone Simpson are the trio of Americans, including Olympic silver medallist Allyson Felix, as well as Muna Lee and Marshevet Hooker.</p> <p><strong>Well Campbell-Brown is on a lap of honour</strong>, trailed home by Felix and Kerron Stewart. She led throughout, and came home in a PB of 21.74 - the fastest time in a decade. Commanding stuff, and with Jamaica winning bronze as well that's, what? seven sprint medals from 12 for them?</p> <p><strong>7.40pm</strong> Turns out Sayers' first round throw was an new British record at 65.75m, impressive stuff. Anyway, we've a little breather while Usain Bolt collects his medal for last night. Please stand for the national anthem. Yes, you.</p> <p><strong>7.43pm</strong> Here goes Goldie again, currently in fourth place. Oh God. They're playing Happy Birthday on the tannoy to Usain Bolt, Sayers shuts her eyes and takes her throw anyway, and the result is 59m-odd. <strong>Time for an apology:</strong> I seem to be doing things backwards, but it's too late to turn this thing around now, so we'll have to go top-to-bottom rather than the bottom-to-top you've come to know and be indifferent to. Mmm, it's starting to rain. This could be about to get messy. OK, messier.</p> <p><strong>7.50pm</strong> And now the first 800m semi, which contains both Yuriy Borzakovskiy and Wilfred Bungei. I just can't see those names without hearing Brendan Foster's gruff voice pronounce them. Should be good anyway. Bungei leads the first lap in 54.4, and Borzakovskiy follows on his shoulder. Bungei finishes first, with Cuba's Lopez Yeiner second. Borzakovskiy will have to wait and see if he makes the two fastest losers. Oh yup, it's really raining now. The L'Equipe guys tug a plastic cover up over our desks, meaning I'm now kind of inside a tent.</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong> and Sayers, still smiling, urges the crowd to clap her on and throws out to 62.92m. She's still fourth. One thing about the efficiency of the staff at these Games - it means you are continually bombarded with A4 print-outs detailing thousands of facts you little or no use for. I've got a small tree's worth around me at the moment. The second 800 semi is underway, with Pechana of Brazil leading them through, but being overtaken by a Kenya's Alfred Yego and the Sudan's Ismail Ismail. Great name.</p> <p>Mouth: who is the greatest stylist? I'd reserve judgment until we see Dayron Robles go in the 110m later on this evening... he's that good to watch.</p> <p><strong>8.05pm</strong> Sayers will start the final three rounds of the javelin in fourth, needing to beat the national record she set with her first through to get up near the medals. Throwing is looking very tough now, what with the puddles on the approach, and her fourth throw doesn't do it. Lining up on the track now are the final eight athletes in the 800m semis, with Britain's Michael Rimmer in lane eight.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm</strong> Rimmer sits at the back of the pack as though he's got something special planned for the finish. He doesn't though, and finishes sixth.</p> <p><strong>Another medal ceremony,</strong> this time for the 20km walk. Please stand for the national anthem of Russia. Meanwhile, the blue-shirted volunteer staff hustle around with more free rain-capes for everyone. Will Britain provide free rain capes for every journalist and spectator at 2012? How much does it even cost to do something like that?</p> <p><strong>8.15pm</strong> The chaps from L'Equipe conspicuously fail to stand for the anthem. Boo. Here's Goldie again, now on her fifth throw. She's not happy with herself, grimacing and bunching her fists after the throw. It was good - 65.05m - but not good enough.</p> <p><strong>8.20pm</strong>The first heat of the 4x100m, featuring the United States 'reserve' quartet, which still features Tyson Gay and Darvis Patton (the other two are named Travis and Rodney - a fine foursome of first names). They have Nigeria inside them, and T&amp;T outside them, but we're really all waiting to watch them get taken apart by Jamaica in the final so don't drop the baton in the heats again fellas.</p> <p><strong>Well guess what?</strong> They dropped the baton. Again. On the final changeover, between Patton and Gay. T&amp;T won at a canter thanks to Richard Thompson's final leg.</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong> and the triple jumpers are being introduced. Triple jump just ever so slightly ludicrous isn't it? I like to think that all athletic events have their routes in ancient and natural activities, but actually, apart from maybe crossing a river there's not much to be said in that regard for triple jumping. More than race walking mind. Still, the first ever Olympic medal was given in triple jumping mind, to James Connolly, though the organisers actually changed it to a hop-hop-jump the night before the competition. Still, it's a serious pedigree. Mind you, they used to have the standing long jump and the tug of war too.</p> <p><strong>8.33pm</strong> Now it's Britain's turn in the 4x100, they're in lane five, inside Jamaica and outside France. All the noise is for the Chinese team in lane eight though. Honestly people, I wouldn't get your hopes up about that one. For all the paper around me, I don't have a teamsheet for this race, but Britain's team is Williamson, Edgar, Pickering and Devonish. The Jamaicans have Michael Frater and Asafa Powell on the straights. By the way, Nigeria also dropped the baton in that first heat, making Jamaica even more of a dead cert. Along as they don't dro... No, Jamiaca win with ease, Pickering powering Britain home in second place with 38.71.</p> <p><strong>Idowu has become such a serious athlete</strong>. The way in which he nailed his first qualifying jump was just stupendous. And he's done it again here. His first leap takes him to 17.51, which puts him straight into first place, and is actually better than anyone else in this field has jumped this season. Nelson Evora, reigning world champion, is his nearest competition, some twenty centimetres behind. And here's the evergreen Larry Achike, bounding out to a slightly lukewarm 16.74m. The javelin is over, with Goldie finishing fourth, a shame given she threw a PB in an Olympic final, and CZE's Barbora Spotakova in first with 71.42, pipping the Russian Maria Abakumova with her final throw.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm</strong> good grief this is relentless. There isn't an empty seat in the house, for those of you wandering. Except a few in the press tribune. The man from L'Equipe is having a very heated conversation with his editor on the phone. He smells awful. That said, I'm sure I'm not too fragrant myself. <strong>So, moving swiftly on,</strong> here's the Women's 4x100m. Britain (Kwakye, Douglas, Freeman and Ania) are in lane nine. This is brilliant. Britain finish second and qaulify behind Belgium, mainly because the USA drop the baton. Again. And again it's on the final changeover. This time, instead of moping about on the track the American anchor turned about, picked up the fallen baton, turned around again and raced to the finish, well back down the field. <strong>Already broken news that I somehow missed: Britain have been disqualified from the men's 4x100m,</strong> which rubs the smug grin off my face at least. I presume for running out of their lane, but I haven't heard for sure.</p> <p><strong>Ah, just when you think you've broken news it turns out you lot all know about it already. Crossed the line without the baton you say? Good grief.</strong> Well anyway. The triple jump has got interesting: Evora had taken the lead with 17.56m, and Idowu, feeling a little pressure, gets 17.31m with his second jump.</p> <p><strong>9pm</strong>, Idowu is now down in third place, with Cuba's Arnie Girat stealing second from him by a single centimetre. What a great final this is turning into. Here's Larry Achike, talking to himself at the start of his run. But it's a foul. The last chapter of the night's slapstick relay is ready to start now. Hmm, I wonder if Jamaica will win? Yes, yes they will. To the L'Equipe's immense disgust, their lot have dropped the baton.</p> <p><strong>9.07pm</strong> Well I don't know what you folk made of those relays from TV, but from where I was it was all thoroughly ridiculous: a total melee. Baffling.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong> Evora has fouled his third jump, and here's Idowu, in all his sweatband bound glory. He needs to pick up six cm to take the lead, but really needs to push out past 17.70m to take control of things. Oh and he likes that! He likes that a lot. He pumps his fists at the crowd and shouts with delight. That's 17.62m for Idowu, and he's back in first with his best jump of the season yet.</p> <p><strong>Right, this is going to be great</strong>, I'm just sorry I can't bring you stride-by-stride. Jeremy Wariner v LaShawn Merritt v Michael Johnson's world record of 43.18. Unless Merritt runs a huge PB, Wariner should have this in his pocket. The question is, can he finally beat his mentor's best time? He's in lane seven. For us British, there's Martyn Rooney, fresh from a PB of 44.60 in the last round, pushing for a bronze.</p> <p><strong>Well, Wariner blew it,</strong> skinned on the second corner by Merritt, who has run a PB of 43.75. Rooney, who false started, finished sixth, and David Neville produced a spectacular head-first dive at the line to clinch third and a US 1-2-3.</p> <p><strong>Johnson still has one record then</strong>, very disappointing by Wariner, who finished a full second behind in second place, with 44.74, though the conditions mitigated against a really quick time. That said, only four men have ever gone faster over 400m than Merritt did, it just so happens that one of them was racing tonight. On the far side of the stadium Larry Achike is still plugging away. He got out to 17.17m with his third jump, which puts him sixth, but his next effort was a foul.</p> <p><strong>So, at 9.35pm</strong> we're in the fourth round of the triple jump, with Phillips Idowu leading by three cm from the Bahama's Leevan Sands. Next on track is the last big final of the night, the 110m hurdles. Not that I want to curse him as well, but he should really own this race. I guess the track conditions will make things a little tricky. He's the most aesthetically pleasing hurdler I've seen since Colin Jackson (who of course never had a good Olympics), a steady head and a straight torso. It's so satisfying when you get a sprint hurdler winning through his technique rather than just his pure speed. <strong>Ah</strong> Evora has taken the lead back in the triple jump! What a contest. He's gone out to 17.67cm, which, again, is five cm ahead of Idowu.</p> <p><strong>In the triple jump,</strong> the top four places are filled by two seasons bests, one personal best and one national record. Great stuff. Idowu, goes long on his latest jump, out near 17.60m, but up goes the red flag. And now the 110m...</p> <p><strong>9.50pm</strong>. Superb. Utterly superb. 12.93 from Robles, untroubled by any of his rivals. This guy is <em>so</em> good to watch. It helps that he looks like Avon Barksdale from The Wire of course. USA pick up silver and bronze.</p> <p><strong>9.55pm</strong> the decathlon 400m races aside, the triple jump now has the stadium to itself. Idowu has two jumps remaining, and is still in second place with 17.62, five cm behind Evora, who has just registered 17.24m with his fifth jump. Robles trots by in front of me, on a rather muted lap of honour.</p> <p><strong>Nope, Idowu's fifth is no good</strong>, he'll have to do it with his last jump if he's to do it all.</p> <p><strong>I'm handed another sheet,</strong> this one featuring flash quotes from the US relay team, both Patton and Gay are claiming individual responsibility for dropping the baton., like two men arguing over who should go through a door first. Just so you know, Brian Clay is leading the decathlon, with the great Roman Sebrle down in sixth. Such a shame Canvey Island's finest Dean Machine Macey didn't make it here to join them.</p> <p><strong>The Stadium is emptying quickly</strong>, and is now less than half full. The Chinese triple jumper didn't make it through to the final round of eight so... Anyway. Achike finishes with another foul and ends up in seventh place overall.</p> <p><strong>Idowu is now guaranteed silver</strong> but can he get that gold with his last jump...? He stands at the end of the runway, pours water on his head from a squeeze bottle, urges the crowd to clap, punches his fist into his palm and runs... and gets it totally wrong. He finishes second to Evora.</p> <p><strong>Well, thanks for your company all,</strong> I'm going to wrap this up now, go outside and smoke furiously. A little disappointing for Britain, Idowu is down in front of me now, looking disconsolate. He's being hugged by Darren Campbell. No doubt he'll feel better in the morning. Right, cheerio.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, Ed Husain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/islam.religion\">accused</a> the Muslim Council of Britain of bowing to extremist pressure and succumbing to its alleged male-dominated sensibilities because it withdrew from an initiative to create a <a href=\"http://www.muslimparliament.org.uk/Documentation/Muslim%20Marriage%20Contract.pdf\">Muslim Marriage Contract</a>. Naturally I beg to differ and here are the reasons why.</p> <p>As chair of the MCB's social and family affairs committee, I regularly come across very real issues of broken families and loveless marriages. These include the very sad cases of forced marriages and domestic violence. Moreover, when two parties enter into a Muslim marriage (<em>nikah</em>) and then seek arbitration in British courts, there is very little documentation that emanates from unions conducted solely on a religious basis. Of course, these issues are not only pertinent to Muslims, but our community should have the mechanism and the wherewithal to tackle them from within the faith with as wide a consensus as possible. </p> <p>So when we were asked by the Muslim Institute, also known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Parliament\"> Muslim Parliament</a>, to endorse and promote the Muslim Marriage Contract on behalf of MCB, we readily did. Here was an opportunity to crystallise the rights and responsibilities already enshrined in Muslim marriages into a simple, usable written format. This would document evidence of rights and responsibilities of both parties to a <em>nikah</em> so that the same can, if necessary be used in British courts. Moreover, such a contract \u2013 if conducted under the wide parameters of Islamic law -\u2013 will re-iterate the free consent of the two parties which is mandatory for a marriage to be valid under Islamic law. </p> <p>Unfortunately those that the MCB had trusted to take the lead in launching the initiative misrepresented the content and claimed that it was a \"re-invention of shariah\" or, as Mr Husain puts it, to \"develop and update\" Islamic jurisprudence without recourse to or the understanding of Islam's diverse juridical viewpoints. I find it strange that while he hastens to speak out against those who condemn Islam's diversity, then proceeds to pronounce that all British Muslims must follow one school of thought, as directed by him. </p> <p>The marriage contract produced by the Muslim Insititute is simply one interpretation of shariah. It is not the shariah that needs to be re-invented, but a change in behaviour among some sections of our diverse Muslim communities. This is an onerous task that cannot be achieved through blustering demands and emphatic slogans that will only resonate in the salons of Islington and Notting Hill.</p> <p>The allegations that the MCB is \"retrogressive and insular\" are misguided and malicious. The source of these allegations causes no surprise. The MCB is a broad-based inclusive organisation of Muslim communities living in the United Kingdom. It recognises and respects the choice of Muslims to follow such interpretation of the shariah in relation to marriage as they wish. </p> <p>MCB represents and serves diverse Muslim communities. The initiative on producing marriage documentation which meets their needs is not motivated only because we feel that Muslim women need protection from abhorrent cultural practices like forced marriages but also to raise awareness about rights and responsibilities of parties under all schools of thought in Islam. Marriage governed by shariah should give women respect, protection and empowerment.</p> <p>MCB remains non-partisan on issues of theology, respecting diversity and supporting individual choices. Disappointed by the initiative, we would like to start again, create a wider consensus and deliver real change based on traditional scholarship and community buy-in. Rather than playing to the gallery, as our detractors would have us do, we need to take meaningful steps that will safeguard the rights of Muslim women in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>The US and Iraq have agreed on the need for timetables for a withdrawal of American troops, Condoleezza Rice said today although the two have yet to finalise a deal that has been the subject of protracted negotiations.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, who was making an unannounced trip to Baghdad, told a press conference that she had held fruitful talks with the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and that a final agreement was near that would \"solidify the significant gains\" in security in Iraq over the last year.</p> <p>\"We have agreed that some goals, some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold, are well worth having in such an agreement,\" Rice told reporters after meeting Iraqi officials. </p> <p>The Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, who appeared with Rice at the press conference, said Iraq's neighbours need not be concerned about the agreement.</p> <p>\"This decision is a sovereign one and Iran and other neighbouring countries have the right to ask for clarifications. ... There are clear articles [that] say that Iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighbouring countries and we already did clarify this.\"</p> <p>A key part of the US-Iraqi draft agreement envisions the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq's cities by next June 30.</p> <p>Earlier, Rice had downplayed reports that an agreement had been reached on a plan that Iraq has been pushing for that will pave the way for American troops to go home. Ahead of the trip, US officials said more fine-tuning was needed on a schedule for withdrawals, immunity from prosecution for US forces and the handling of Iraqi prisoners. </p> <p>Zebari conceded that officials had hoped to conclude the US-Iraq security pact earlier but internal political factors had prevented this.</p> <p>\"This agreement determines the principal provisions, requirements, to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon, the mission of the US forces,\" he said. \"Really, we are very, very close to closing this agreement and as we said from the beginning, there is no hidden agenda here.\"</p> <p>Iraq says it would like the agreement to include dates for US forces to withdraw from the country, with the US ceasing routine patrols on Iraqi streets by the middle of next year, and withdrawing combat troops by 2010 or 2011. Withdrawal in two years' time would be in line with proposals by the US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, who wants American troops out by mid-2010.</p> <p>The Bush administration and John McCain, the Republican candidate, do not want to commit to firm withdrawal dates, preferring vaguer terms such as \"time horizons\" and \"aspirational goals\" for a pullout. The US, which still has about 140,000 US troops in Iraq, insists that it would be wiser to set a target linked to the attainment of certain objectives that would reflect not only security improvements but also progress on the political and economic fronts.</p> <p>Other issues that need to be sorted out include immunity for US troops from Iraqi law and the status of prisoners held by American forces. The US holds some 21,000 prisoners in Iraq who it considers dangerous but have not been charged with any crime.</p> <p>Rice said she would also discuss Iraq's failure to enact an election law to allow provincial polls due on October 1 to take place on time. The election law was held up in parliament because of a dispute between Kurds and other groups over how to run the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, despite strong American pressure for Iraqi politicians to reach a deal.</p> <p>A US-Iraq security agreement deal will allow US forces to stay in Iraq beyond the end of this year, when a UN security council mandate expires. The mandate for an international presence was enacted after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.</p>",
  "<p>An NHS trust that took 42 minutes to dispatch an ambulance to aid a road accident victim was today ordered to improve its service.</p> <p>Student Rebecca Wedd, 23, was hit by a car as she walked along the A433 near Coates in Gloucestershire, with friends in May last year. </p> <p>She lay injured for 42 minutes - four times the national target of eight minutes - before she was flown by air ambulance to Frenchay hospital in Bristol, where she died the following day.</p> <p>Watchdog the Healthcare Commission launched a review into the conduct of Great Western ambulance service (GWAS) NHS trust following the death.</p> <p>Concerns had been raised about the trust's failure to meet national targets on response times before the accident, said the commission.</p> <p>Its review looked at the way GWAS handled calls, dispatched ambulances and looked after patients. The findings, published today, say that since the accident the trust had responded to concerns and made improvements to its service. </p> <p>Changes such as the introduction of a new ambulance dispatch system and a review of its vehicle fleet have reduced the risk of a similar incident recurring, the commission said. </p> <p>But it did identify areas where the trust must improve its current practice.</p> <p>The report said: \"This includes the way in which it responds to concerns from the public and how it documents its action taken in response to incidents. </p> <p>\"We have also made recommendations to ensure that staff are clear about their roles in a work environment that has seen many changes over the past few years.\" </p> <p>The commission urged the trust to continue driving down response times. </p> <p>Currently the trust responds to 72.2% of immediately life threatening incidents within eight minutes - the national target is to accomplish this for 75% of calls. </p> <p>Nigel Ellis, the commission's head of investigations, said: \"The incident that triggered this intervention is a real tragedy. It follows that the trust should continue to do everything possible to ensure it does not happen again. </p> <p>\"We are satisfied that lessons have been learned and the trust is addressing the main concerns by making changes to its systems to reduce the risk of an incident like this being repeated.\" </p> <p>The commission made five recommendations, including ensuring there is a clear system for investigating all incident and setting up a programme of regular workshops and team meetings to discuss performance issues. </p> <p>The commission will revisit the trust in six months to check progress against these recommendations.</p> <p>Dr Ossie Rawstorne, clinical director at GWAS, said: \"I wish to reassure the public that Great Western ambulance service is delivering better and faster <br>patient care than ever before. </p> <p>\"We still have challenges ahead but we have made significant improvements in the last 17 months.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We accept all five of the commission's recommendations and will have implemented four of them completely by the end of next month.\"</p>",

  "<p>Not so long ago the prospect of seeing a Ben Affleck film wasn't high on most right-minded people's to do list. But the actor, director and Oscar-winning screenwriter is now experiencing something of a career revival, and the news that he's been cast as an ambulance-chasing lawyer in the new comedy from King of the Hill creator Mike Judge will do nothing to hurt it.</p> <p>Affleck will star with fellow Hollywood renaissance man Jason Bateman, Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Mila Kunis and Kristen Wiig in the new film from the director of cult comedy Office Space, <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990868.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">according to Variety</a>. The project, titled Extract, centres on Bateman's character, the owner of a flower extract company who's facing problems at work and a nasty streak of misfortune which has culminated in his wife embarking on a love affair with a male prostitute.</p> <p>The film will also feature Clifton Collins Jr as a factory worker due a huge payout after losing a body part - one assumes this may well be where the Affleck character comes in. Judge has written the screenplay and will also take a producer's role. </p> <p>The feature is being financed by Miramax, the independent film company once owned by the Weinstein brothers, with whom Affleck has had a long affinity, going back to his break-through performance in Good Will Hunting. His critically acclaimed directing debut, this year's Gone Baby Gone, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/30/benaffleck\">also produced through the company</a>. </p> <p>Affleck has recently returned to acting after a two-year hiatus since making a cameo in the 2006 Joe Carnahan thriller Smokin' Aces. He will also appear in the comedy He's Just Not That Into You and the Hollywood big screen adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/04/news.russellcrowe\">BBC political drama series State of Play</a>. </p> <p>Extract begins shooting on Monday in Los Angeles.</p>",
  "<p>Wet weather and the high price of fuel could make the roads quieter than usual over this bank holiday weekend, transport and travel observers are predicting.</p> <p>A survey for the AA says 56% of motorists are not going to be travelling at all over the August bank holiday. One in four blames the price of petrol.</p> <p>Traffic will still be heavier than on a normal weekend, with an estimated 18m of the country's 33m cars expected to hit the roads.</p> <p>Stephen Dunk of Travelzoo.co.uk said: \"Everybody wants to get away this weekend, not only for the bank holiday, but it's the end of the school holidays too, so people want to make the most of it. It will be a double whammy.\" </p> <p>With all journeys expected to take about 50% longer than normal, Dunk offered motorists some tips to make driving less stressful:</p> <p>\u2022 Avoid the routes that always become congested: \"Roads to coastal resorts and those in Norfolk and the Lake District always clog up. Avoid them if you can. The same goes for roads near superstores.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Check online for roadworks: \"Even if you can't avoid them, knowing what to expect makes the journey more bearable.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Don't rely on your satnav: \"They don't always use the best route. Instead of inputting the final destination, use key locations along the way to ensure the best course.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Travel at odd times: \"If you are making a relatively short journey, set out late at night or very early in the morning.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Return journeys can be even worse: \"Everyone returns on Monday evening. Why not stay an extra day or two and avoid the inevitable traffic jams coming back into cities?\"</p> <p>\u2022 Plan for traffic jams: \"Ensure you have water in the car, your phone is fully charged and you have a bag of sweets and toys for the children in case you get stuck.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Find out what events are on locally: \"You may find you would rather stay at home.\"</p> <h2>Disruption travellers can expect this weekend</h2> <p><strong>Roads:</strong> In an effort to cut road journey times, the Highways Agency has suspended roadwork in 49 places from Friday to Monday, but work in 38 locations will continue.</p> <p>The M1 between J32 and J35 will be closed for most of Sunday while the Tinsley cooling towers in South Yorkshire are demolished.</p> <p>The country's busiest roads will be the M25 around London, the M1 northbound, the M6 through the west Midlands and the M5 near Bristol.</p> <p>Two major celebrations in London will also cause traffic chaos: the three-day Notting Hill carnival begins on Saturday in west London, while about 40,000 people will flood into the Mall on Sunday to celebrate the end of the Beijing Olympics and the start of London's tenure as host city for the summer games.</p> <p><strong>Rail:</strong> Travellers planning to use the trains are being advised to check their service is running before setting out as Network Rail's bank holiday works programme is affecting large parts of the network.</p> <p>Signal, track and station works are being carried out in Paddington, Rugby, Nuneaton, Derby and Manchester.</p> <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Meteorologists at the Met Office predict there will be intermittent light showers starting on Friday and moving across the country from the west by Saturday afternoon, lasting through to early Sunday. </p> <p>By Monday, another Atlantic weather system will bring rain to the UK's north-western shores.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Met Office said: \"It won't pour down, but if you're heading to the beach pack a rain mac.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was a joke going round the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Climate Camp</a> in the last days. As well as the \"wellbeing tent\", which dealt with mildly traumatised activists on the receiving end of 5am police batons, someone proposed a \"wellmeaning\" tent. It would accommodate those who'd like to include state and capitalism-based solutions in the movement to reverse climate change. The camp's outer fence would curve into the wellmeaning tent to create a round-table for stakeholders including the police (successfully kept out of the site after days of stand-offs), E.ON UK and other energy industry representatives \u2013 tea and hand-wringing optional.</p> <p>The joke was prompted by a controversial presentation by George Monbiot, in which he endorsed the use of the state as a partner in resolving the climate crisis. Monbiot held the audience rapt as he explained the fundamental incompatibility of economic growth with the emission cuts needed to avert catastrophic climate change. Yet he confessed not knowing where to turn next to solve the issues of how to generate the changes necessary to shift our sources of energy, production and consumption, and where the state and capitalism fit in. He ended by endorsing the use of the state: \"By God, let's use it\". Amid the applause, some were appalled. Let me explain why.</p> <p>Many of the organisers of the climate camps honed their skills in the anti-roads movement of the mid-1990s. Some came from the traveller, squatter and free party communities, an alliance of resistance built up to counter the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994\">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994</a>, which criminalised travellers and activists reclaiming land and buildings for social, cooperative use. These activists came from a culture of anti-authoritarian anti-capitalism \u2013 rejecting the property ladder and the commodification of living space, and embracing collective enjoyment, dance and music.</p> <p>The continuum of this culture of resistance, of a struggle for a commons, for control over one's own and one's family's life, for non-alienated labour and social interaction, stretches back to the <a href=\"http://libcom.org/history/articles/diggers-levellers-1642-52/\">Diggers, Levellers</a> and the Luddites \u2013 English radicals struggling against the monarchy, taxes, land enclosure and austerity measures designed to empower a new industrial class, funded by a feudal and colonial land-grab and slavery.</p> <p>This historical memory, and these beliefs in a global commons, in leaderless, participative organising and grassroots anti-state and anti-capitalist action run deep through the camps. They're also informed by a culture of direct action and a refusal to accept top-down solutions and a system of parliamentary democracy that reduces participation in politics to 16 \"X\"s in a box in an average lifetime.</p> <p>But did <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ib29WamKmU&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=1F2D4DCC56E3A7C4&amp;index=62\">Scargill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2000/06/09/about-george-monbiot/\">Monbiot</a> really \"get\" the camp and its cultures of resistance? The latest edition of the NUM's newsletter criticised the camp for being too middle-class, anti-miner, and alienated from \"real\", genuine working class \"realities\". Are these representations fair? Many participants in the camp could be defined as the \"precariat\" \u2013 neoliberalism's answer to the proletariat. No longer an urbanised worker in a regular job in for a majority of their working life, the precariat lives and works in a precarious state, at the mercy of a deregulated labour market. Work is dominated by casualisation, flexible and migrant labour, zero-hour contracts, temping, seasonal work, home working, self-employment and unemployment. Many at the camp form a part of this working class, no more in the control of the means of production than energy industry workers here or China or Poland.</p> <p>State solutions to the climate crisis were presented to us 10 years ago through the Kyoto protocol \u2013 what were they? To privatise the air we breathe and turn carbon emissions into commodities, to buy and sell atmospheric poison, to create a new market of trading in the means of ecological destruction. It's no wonder many at the camp reject state solutions to climate change.</p> <p>Entertaining as the two-minutes-in-a-room-full-of-poison <a href=\"http://greenmansoccasional.blogspot.com/2008/08/scargill-and-monbiot-debate-coal-and.html\">standoff</a> between Monbiot and Scargill is, this gesture politics isn't getting to the heart of the fight. The question is, who and under what conditions, controls decision-making, and has climate-changing power? Who will pay the price of exile from family and common land, water and food insecurity, as land and rivers become polluted or diverted into the energy industry's use, for bauxite, uranium, coal, and iron-ore to build new infrastructure, power nuclear energy, expand the global coal market and concomitant infrastructure to perpetuate the whole process?</p> <p>How do we bring about a transformation which empowers us all? Grassroots organising in cooperative, low-impact, sustainable ways, glimpsed at the Climate Camp, and practised daily by millions, is one way towards this. Another is to live at the sharpest end of climate chaos today.</p> <p>So how about this for a challenge, George and Arthur? Spend two months, not two minutes, (together!) living in Matlu Camp in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharsuguda\">Jharsuguda</a>, in Orissa province, India. One of the poorest states on earth, here in the heart of India's coal belt, are families displaced by mining, living in a polluted form of captivity. Where our very own Department for International Development has been restructuring governance, reinforcing the mining industries, and guiding land reforms allowing for the felling of pristine forest, more tribal resettlement and more environmental destruction.</p> <p>Changing our sources of energy without changing our sources of economic and political power will not make a difference. Neither coal nor nuclear are the \"solution\", we need a revolution.</p>",
  "<p><br>Take two guitars on tour with me? I don't think so ... Songwriter in demand Mark Ronson. Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty</p> <p>In the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/1\">In Praise of ... songwriters</a> blog on Monday, I read that \"Songwriters are being feted by the European commission which wants to extend musicians' royalty rights from 50 years to a very generous 95 years.\"</p> <p>This is a misunderstanding that I've come across quite often, especially when the European directive was applauded (or, more often, criticised) in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/18/law\">recent media coverage</a>. The misunderstanding arises from people confusing musicians with songwriters.</p> <p>Let me try and clear this up. </p> <p>Songwriters retain their copyrights for the rest of their lives, plus an additional 70 years. All the European commission is trying to do is to bring musicians' copyrights closer to those of songwriters and other copyright owners.</p> <p>Musicians' royalties get paid in a different way and by a different organisation than that of songwriters - and they have different rights too. In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.ppluk.com/\">PPL</a> collects performance royalties for musicians and <a href=\"http://www.mcps-prs-alliance.co.uk/Pages/default.aspx\">MCPS-PRS</a> collects them for songwriters.</p> <p>The article continues: \"But the commission is also moving to break up the national monopolies that collect royalties for musicians.\" Not exactly - to be more precise it should instead say songwriters, which would make the following line in the article more accurate: \"It's a question of lose some, win nothing.\" Indeed, but for songwriters. And here's why. Pay attention though, this is going to be a bit tricky ...</p> <p>Every country has its own collection society that negotiates licensing deals with local broadcasters. They belong to CISAC, the International Confederation of Authors and Composers Societies, a reciprocal network that gives broadcasters such as the BBC a one-stop shop to license a global repertoire (though not for broadcasting over the internet, which transcends national borders), while ensuring writers are paid for use of their work.</p> <p>In the EU these collection societies are vastly different. The Greek one is run by a family. The Spanish one has 466 people working for it, which makes it very good at collecting, but not necessarily as cost effective as MCPS-PRS. Many countries also tend to take a cut out of foreign royalties and give it to their indigenous writers - their argument being that they need to support local talent (MCPS-PRS doesn't, by the way).</p> <p>The French collection society has taken this a step further, by forcing its radio stations to play 40% French music during peak hours, half of which has to be by \"new talent\". The system is not perfect, by any means, and as internet licensing has become more prevalent, the industry is grappling with finding a way to create a one-stop shop for that too.</p> <p>Now the European commission has decided to get rid of the monopoly of <a href=\"http://www.contentagenda.com/articleXml/LN834293950.html?industryid=45174\">each country's collection society</a> and CISAC as a body. But, as these societies are not for profit, can competition rules apply to non-commercial bodies? They're simply there to look after songwriters' licenses, make sure they get paid and at the same time provide a service for broadcasters.</p> <p>As you have no doubt gathered, this is an issue that's so complicated that many people in the European Commission, as well as in the music industry, have a problem understanding it.</p> <p>The ruling was pushed through in mid-July and will come into effect in October. It looks like it's going to plunge the whole licensing system into chaos. Many big composers say that they'll refuse to grant permission to the societies that will license their songs at \"bargain bin\" prices, which will result in broadcasters like the BBC having to trawl around all 24 European societies to be able to play whatever music they'd like.</p> <p>The worst-case scenario would be a stand-off where most songwriters will sign up to the society that's most efficient and pays the best, while broadcasters will go to the societies that have the cheapest licenses, who by then will have very few licences to \"sell\".</p> <p>Surely the aim should be to make all music available to consumers/listeners, making it easier for broadcasters to play it and for songwriters to get paid fairly? This blunt legislation is based on a well-meaning but somewhat <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/511&amp;form\">\"broken logic\"</a>.</p> <p>The European commission doesn't fully understand the unique circumstances that exist when it comes to music. We'll see just how wrong they've got it when October comes around. Their ignorance in the matter could prove detrimental to both music listeners and songwriters all over Europe.</p>",

Thoughts, questions, anecdotes etc.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.35am</strong> The decathletes have not been spared, though, and are being forced to run their 100 metres heats in the worst conditions seen at these Games so far. The rain is pouring down and, frankly, is not helping at all. Britain's Daniel Awde ran in 11.06sec, perhaps not what he had hoped for, but he seems happy enough anyway. That's the spirit.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.39am</strong> And now to a sport which is ridiculed in many quarters - but not here of course - walking. The women's 20km is on its way. Brilliant.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.50am</strong> Let us now for a moment rejoice in the fact that China have got another medal, this time the bronze medal in the beach volleyball competition, the hosts beating Brazil in the third-place play-off. The conditions there are awful as well with the slightly random sight of the competitors wearing tiny bikinis while the crowd is wrapped up warm with loads of umbrellas around.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.52am</strong> Just over 50 minutes gone in the 10km men's swimming marathon and Britain's Davies is still in the lead. Germany's Thomas Lurz is lurking behind Davies, in third at the moment, and so is the second-placed Gianniotis.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.00am</strong> Following the recent discussion on these pages about which country has been the most successful in Beijing so far (and, obviously, to make it a bit interesting, we had to make it per capita) I was wondering which country is the worst (per capita)? </p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> <p>Davies still in the lead, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.05am</strong> Good news for the competitors (and us, to be honest as we don't want more cancelled events this morning) as the forecast says that the torrential rain should stop. We should, in fact, see some sunny periods with only a few showers and thunderstorms later in the day.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.10am</strong> A nice email arrives from Hong Kong, where Steven McGill writes: \"Commentary has to be up there with the greats. Can't think of any of the greats name right now but up there none the less.</p> <p>However one question keeps coming up. How on earth are you juggling the need to watch upteenth TV feeds, read your readers emails and respond with such panache while fitting in those 'natural breaks'?\" <br> Without getting too technical I can reveal that we have a team of highly skilled operators here in London, updating me with the latest events at Beijing and checking my copy so that I don't swear, upset anyone or make too many mistakes. As for those natural breaks - they can wait.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.14am</strong> Back at the swimming, the \"supreme tactician\" that is Vladimir Dyatchin of Russia, is making a move from down the field and could threaten Britain's Davies, who is still in the lead. The swimmers have been in the water for 75 minutes and they are still going as if they had a dangerous shark behind them. Where do they get the energy from? Remarkable stuff.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.22am</strong> Another feeding station and more \"gel down Davies' trunks\" we are told. Incredible. This man is swimming 10km with gel down his trunks? What's next? I mean, really.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.23am</strong> Germany's Lurz is moving up level with Davies, as I get an email from someone in Australia who can't be named because she is supposed to be working, not reading our MBM. Let's call her Karen, shall we?</p> <p>\"How do you know who is in the lead of the swim if they've taken their hats off to avoid detection?\"</p> <p>Well, the swimmers have their numbers painted on their backs which is easy to spot if you are sitting next to a 16\" Tosumi television in London but less easy to spot while you are swimming behind the person.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.25am</strong> The swimmers are into their final lap while, elsewhere, Britain have two divers in the 10 metre platform, Stacey powell and Tonia Couch.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.28am</strong> Josh Lanier emails regarding the worst country at the per capita Olympics: \"The worst per capita must be India. They just won their first ever summer Olympics medal. Pretty pathetic for a country of over a billion people.\"</p> <p>Now, Josh, you may have a point but calling someone, even if it is a country, pathetic, is not going to make you any friends.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.29am</strong> Incredible developments in the swimming. Thomas Lurz has raced in to the lead, overtaking Davies, who is in second. The Australian Ky Hurst, is also up there, as is Vladimir Dyatchin. This is going to be a great finish.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.34am</strong> Britain, sadly, I can reveal is not doing terribly well at the modern pentathlon. Sam Weale is in 25th after the first event, shooting, while Nick Woodbridge, is faring even worse. He is joint last at the moment. Oh well, four events to go. </p> <p>Intriguingly, no athlete who has won the shooting has gone on to win the Olympic Gold, which is bad news for David Svoboda of the Czech Republic, who is first right now. </p> <p>Next up, fencing.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.36am</strong> Andy Collings emails and is also voting for India as the worst country at the games per capita. Any other suggestions or should we crown India as the champions of this, less-than-glorious race for honours?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.38am</strong> Love this suggestions from Kim Best in Montreal. </p> <p>\"Running races would be much more exciting if they could use tactics like they do in that violent ol' water race there. No, this is not a suppressed desire to see Usain Bolt rugby tackled...\"</p> <p>How wonderful. Imagine a 100 metre runner who is falling behind suddenly throwing himself at Usain Bolt's calves, leaving Asafa Powell or someone else winning the race. Unless, he is tackled of course. Could be carnage. </p> <p>If you like the idea, email the IOC. Now.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.42am</strong> Kim also writes that she is having an unusual television experience. </p> <p>\"I currently have diving (is this happening now, or is this a lazy repeat from CBC? Anyone?) with French commentary...and despite not knowing enough French to understand it properly, I'm pretty sure the response to the Australian's poor attempt was \"And that was a beautiful belly flop from the Australian...\" Well, that was the tone of voice. I'm also intrigued as to why diving comes in French and track and field come in English... Although maybe I haven't discovered the magic button yet.\"</p> <p>Anyone who knows?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.43am</strong> 700 metres left in the swimming and Davies has taken a few-metres lead. The Liverpool-born Greek Gianniotis is still in the medal race as well. He is second now.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.46am</strong> Davies now about five or six metres ahead. he is powering down the final straight but there is still quite a long way to go. A lot can still happen.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>3.47am Oliver Pattenden asks: \"This lengthy swim, where are they exactly? Just freely lapping a pool? The regular 'Olympic' size pool, or is there like a 5k pool they go up and down once in? Surely they're not out on a lake or some such natural body of water?\"</p> <p>They are outside indeed. Remarkably. Chunyi the place is called.</p> <p>Davies still in the lead but is looking a bit tired. About 250 metres left now.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.49am </strong> You will not believe this but Davies is not going in the right direction. He is way off line. The good news is that the chasing pack is following him.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.50am</strong> He is now making a dramatic move towards the right direction. Great news.</p> <p>Oh no, Thomas Lurz has just swam past Davies.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.51am</strong> And from nowhere the Dutch swimmer, Maarten van der Weijden swims past Lurz and Davies and wins gold. Davies finishes second and Lurz is third. It is a tremendous effort by the Briton but if it had not been for his wayward directional sense on the final straight he would probably have won it. </p> <p>Wow. What a race.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.56am</strong> Davies is absolutely exhausted. What a tremendous swim. Another medal for Great Britain, silver this time. </p> <p>And never mind Davies, I am exhausted as well.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.59am</strong> No rest for the wicked though. The women's 20km walk has finished with the Russian Olga Kaniskina winning in a new Olympic record time, and Britain's Johanna Jackson doing really well as well, setting a new British record and finishing 22nd. Well done in the rain. </p> <p>I can also report that David Davies, who won silver in the 10km swim marathon, is ok and now sitting up. He was absolutely exhausted after the race and there were initially some concerns about the Welshman but he has recovered somewhat. What a performance.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.07am</strong> A quick breather for me before I tackle the latest emails in my inbox.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>4.08am A very interesting point from Owen Linderholm: \"While Josh Lanier has a point about India - surely 2 (I believe they have two medals) per about 1 billion people is still more than zero. Which is what the about 100 countries that haven't won any medals have. So surely the right answer is whichever of hte countries that have failed to win a medal is the largest in terms of population?</p> <p>A quick squint suggest that would be Pakistan - (off the top of my head) but I'm pretty sure they are in the running for medals here and there so I don't expect that to last\"</p> <p>Like your thinking!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>Scott Mellor writes a witty email, which I will copy and paste in to this slot now. It has been edited though, as he has mentioned one of our media rivals here in the UK and as we all know, there is only one website for sports coverage in this country. Ha ha, only joking. </p> <p>Good Morning,</p> <p>\"The Channel 4 website has an alternative medal table where you can choose to see the medal table by population, GDP and human rights India are bottom of the table for population and GDP</p> <p>Mind you I see the Aussies are claiming to be first combining population and per capita into the equation, dreadful state of affairs what about medals Vs other social indicators like binge drinking and teenage pregnancies I'm sure we would top those ones.\"</p> <p>Cheers</p> <p>Scott Mellor</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.13am</strong> There is, seemingly, no end to the excitement in Beijing this morning. It turns out that Svoboda set a new Olympic record in the modern pentathlon shooting earlier while in the beach volleyball final, China and the US are 14-14 in the first set. Are you watching George W Bush? Er, probably.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.16am</strong> The emails showing unrestrained support for David Davies are pouring in, you will all be pleased to hear (well, the first has arrived at least). </p> <p>Paul from Canberra writes: \"Hi Guardian, I really feel sorry for David Davies. For years we've watched him finish behind Grant Hacket in 1,500m races, and now just when he looks like winning an Olympic gold, he's mauled by a Dutch giant. Is there some kind of Welsh jinx on him? But he's a hell of a wholehearted trier.\"</p> <p>Couldn't agree more. The US are now 20-17 up in the first set in the beach volley ball final against China. The hosts call a time out, but surely there is no way back in this first set?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.20am</strong> A colleague here in London points out that the dj is perhaps not being patriotic enough at the beach volleyball, playing American music between points. And I thought the Chinese had thought about everything. Clearly not. </p> <p>Or could it be a ploy to make the American women lose their focus and start humming to \"Axel F\" or some other 80s hit. </p> <p>Well, if it is, it is not working. The US are 3-1 up in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.26am</strong> Good news from the Aquatic Centre as Britain's Stacey Powell and Tonia Couch progress to the final in the 10metre platform.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.29am</strong> Equally good news from Montreal, some us will feel, where Kim Best has gone some way to find out how her television works. Kim, you will remember, had some sports with commentary in French and some in English. </p> <p>So, what happened? (by the way, the US are now 8-6 up in the women's beach volley ball final)</p> <p>\"I have solved the Canadian telly mystery! How exciting. The English is on a different channel (in my defence at not already knowing this, not my tv), although still CBC, it is still intriguingly showing different sports. So, apparently, French Canadians will want to watch diving and Anglophone Canadians will want to watch beach volleyball and strange insert bits which seem to be CBC doing a BBC style 'let's clutch at the straws we're good at' bit? This. Is. Baffling. What, may I ask, is wrong with an interactive option, or even the choice of subtitles?</p> <p>I think I'm going to switch back to the French. If only for the beard on that presenter.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.30am</strong> Right, it is half four in the morning and I just don't believe some of the crazy emails you are sending me. But, a quick look around shows that Chris (a Pom in Sydney) is actually right about this Australian basketball player <a href=\"http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=4&amp;ContentID=93046\">moaning about the US Dream Team sledging him</a> during the defeat the other day. Ah, the irony. Not that any sledging was needed. The US won 116-85.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4.36am</strong> This beach volleyball final is a cracker. The US are now 17-15 up and a time out has been called. </p> <p>Meanwhile, an email arrives from the multi-tasking Joanne in New Zealand (working, emailing, following the olympics at the same time). </p> <p>She asks: \"A question that hopefully you or someone else can answer: how come everyone's talking about guaranteed bronzes in the boxing? As far as I can work out the Brits are through to the semis, and if they win the semis they'll be guaranteed silver or gold. But surely if they lose the semi then they have to fight the loser of the other semi for that bronze - or do both losers get a bronze medal? That seems a bit odd to me, especially given that in other sports where there's a knock-out system (eg the cycling sprints and pursuits) there's a race for bronze and some poor soul has to come fourth.\"</p> <p>The answer is, I am told, that there are two bronze medals handed out in the boxing for the losing semi-finalists, which seems fair enough.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.42am</strong> <br>Luke Howard from London emails: \"What's going on with the diving? I don't have a red button... When does the 14 year old Brit compete again?\"</p> <p>Tom Daley, my friend, is diving again on Friday noon BST and the two British women, Powell and Couch, both went through to the final. </p> <p>A question for you Luke, what on earth are you doing up at this hour?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.45am</strong> Well, the US have come out on top of this battle of the super powers, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh, have won the beach volleyball final. They are truly worthy champions. They did not drop a single set on their way to glory. We take our hats off and will soon take a look at the decathlon, which is going on in the rain.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.51am</strong> The Americans are doing well in the decathlon with Trey Hardee and Bryan Clay taking an early lead after the 100 metres and the first long jump. The inspirational banner \"All the way, Bryan Clay\" seen in the Bird's Nest must be helping. Or maybe not.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.55am</strong> Clay has now jumped 7.78 metres in his second attempt.</p> <p>Britain's Daniel Awde has reached 6.98 and 7.12 with his two efforts so far.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.57am</strong> There is some concern here in the office in London that Team GB, despite its strong showing in Beijing, may not catch up - and, indeed, overhaul - the US and China in the medals table for London 2012. </p> <p>So we want your emails on what sports we can introduce in order to close the gap. Fox hunting is one early suggestion, cricket another one. </p> <p>Any other suggestions? Dog-walking perhaps or dogs walking on their hind legs - or both?</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5.04am</strong> The teakwondo is also underway with, I am being told by one colleague, one combatant beating another combatant. Er, great stuff. I think I need to get back to you on that one with some names.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.07am</strong> There is also an intriguing match going on in the table tennis third round with Chen Weixing competing for Austria, playing Wang Hao of China. </p> <p>Chen Weixing, doesn't sound very Austrian to me? Anyone out there who knows what his story is?</p> <p>Hao won the first set, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>5.16am Ah, great suggestions for sports to increase GB's medal haul at 2012:</p> <p>Here is a good one from Matthew Reilly: \"Morris dancing is the obvious choice for the Olympics in 2012, with the inclusion of weight categories to increase your gold medal haul.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.17am</strong> Another suggestion comes from our multi-tasking favourite Aussie, who still can't be named because she is supposed to be working. </p> <p>\"Black Pudding eating, Oversized 4x4 driving in built up areas near schools.\"</p> <p>Love it.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.21am</strong> Right, here we are with some names from the gripping Teakwondo: Daniel Manz of Germany beat Rasul Abduraim of Kyrgystan in a thriller with no scores until the fourth, sudden death round. </p> <p>Also, still in the Under-68kg category, Servet Tazegul beat Gessler Viera of Cuba to reach the quarter-finals. We wish them well.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.23am</strong> I can tell you that things are looking good for the hosts in the table tennis with Wang leading Chen (of Austria) 2 sets to 0 in the third round of the men's singles. </p> <p>And I feel obliged to share this email with you all from Scott Tran in Australia, which may be described as funny in some areas of this world, but not here in the office, for obviousl reasons. </p> <p>Mr Tran writes: \"Cricket as a way of increasing your gold medal haul? Who are you kidding?\"</p> <p>KP, don't listen to him.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.28am</strong> Chris Page emails about possible sports for 2012 to overtake China and the US. </p> <p>\"Tea drinking? Darts? Use of irony?</p> <p>(Actually, I've just realised the introduction of tea drinking would play right into the hands of china... unless, of course, we insist on the inclusion of milk.)\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.37am</strong> As there is a bit of a hiatus in live sport at the moment, I will share with you all an insight in to the world of table tennis, from \"Angus Beefcake\". </p> <p>\"The table tennis [women's] is getting a touch ridiculous - basically, there are so many talented Chinese players that all but the very best can't even get<br>close to the national team, so they go overseas. Of the world's top 20,<br>17 are born in China, but only nine actually compete for China. The<br>world's top five are all competing for China still (but only three are<br>in the Olympics - that's how tough it is...imagine being world number<br>four and not being able to compete?!?), but after that in the top 10,<br>there's Chinese competing for Singapore and HK. Those are the top two<br>destinations...good money, good life....but some go as far afield as<br>Congo and Dominican Republic to get a game.</p> <p>Still, none of them will beat Zhang Yining or Wang Nan of China proper -<br>they are just too damn good, though Li Jiawei of Singapore is a danger\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.40am </strong> Just to reinforce the point made by Angus: the three Chinese women sailed through the fourth round with impressive wins:</p> <p>Wang Nan (Chn) bt Mi Young Park (Kor) 4-2<br>Zhang Yining (Chn) bt Ai Fukuhara (Jpn) 4-1<br>Guo Yue (Chn) bt Jiao Li (Ned) 4-0 </p> <p>or should that be Jiao Van der Li?</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.50am</strong> Stay with us everyone, there is more live sport coming up in just a bit. I am hoping that the sailing hasn't been suspended as well because of the bad weather - as the BMX was earlier tonight. </p> <p>Meanwhile, more suggestions for 2012 sports which would benefit Team GB:</p> <p>From Peter Young in a wet and cold Melbourne: \"What about humour - surely we'd clean up there? Men's and women's sarcasm, and possibly an open stand up event. These could always be combined with a more physical<br>discipline, such as gesturing or that game where you try to put you <br>finger through a beermat on top of a glass (the beer mat on<br>the glass I mean, obviously).\"</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.51am</strong> Britain's Daniel Awde is 17th after two events in the decathlon (100 metres and long jump), not a bad effort by the youngster.</p> <p>And with that I will list the last suggestions for new sports at the 2012 Olympics: <br>Andy Collings writes: \"What about medieval sports getting a resurrection? Shin Hacking, jousting, horseshoe tossing and that old football where you had to take a pigs bladder over to the next village. Surely GB's past results in those are unrivalled?\"</p> <p>And from James Chapman in Hong Kong: \"What about actual boat-racing (by which I don't mean any of that messing around on the river nonsense, but eight men (or women - more medal potential there for us, certainly) downing drinks in a pub)? You could have different events for different drinks - lager, bitter, guinness, wine...the russians might take us on the vodka, but we would come good again on the alcopops. And if all the rounds were done in one session, it could make for some great telly.\"</p> <p>Now we obviously don't condone that kind of behaviour here at the Guardian...</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>5.56am</strong> I like this. So many medals - and so many ways of deciding which is the best country at the Olympics. The Americans (at least Fox News) has, unsurprisingly, the US top because they have won more medals than China, whereas the rest of the world has China on top...</p> <p>Josh Nealon writes: \"I notice that Fox News has the US ahead on medals, as they use the total count, rather than the number of gold. Clearly both systems are unfair \u2013 how about the obvious 3 points, 2 points and 1 point for gold, silver and bronze? China stays top, the Russians overtake the Brits, and the French and Cubans jump a few places. Fair or unfair?\"</p> <p>I think that would probably be the most fair way of doing it.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.00am</strong> Wow, it is six o clock already - and now we have got live volleyball on the way. Come on! Stay with us. </p> <p>The US v Cuba in the first semi-final. This is more than just sport, this is a battle of ideologies. Well, maybe not. </p> <p>Still, exciting stuff and the US has just won the first set - 25-20. Follow this space.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.05am</strong> The sailing is underway and there is a chance for another gold for Britain in the Star class but more about that later. </p> <p>The Tornado sailors deserve a special mention, though. It is the last time the Tornado class is on the Olympics programme for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>A sad day indeed and even more sad as there are no British medal hopes out there.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.13am</strong> A good email arrives from Tim Maitland and, as I have now way of verifying this, I have to trust him. He claims to have met the great Chen Weixing, who sadly went out of the table tennis tournament today. He represented Austria...</p> <p>\"Marcus... I'm not sure I should admit this... but regarding Chen Weixing... I've actually met the guy and very charming he is too.<br> <br>He's actually from Inner Mongolia... and is a chopper! Choppers are great - they're defensive players who play predominantly with bottom-spin often from huge distances away from the table - because, contrary to what you might think, they create the most entertaining matches.<br> <br>On a seperate note... re: the \"Angus Beefcake\" comment... <br> <br>I agree in the broader sense that the blurring of the national boundaries needs reigning in. But at the Chinese have been migrating for economic reasons for centuries. Where does he propose drawing the line? <br>You could say the same about Afro-Caribbean sprinters, Kenyan/Ethiopian middle distance runners (USA, Qatar, etc) and, of course South African cricketers.\"</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.18am</strong> If you are just joining us I can tell you that Britain's David Davies produced a stunning performance in the men's 10km open air swimming and finished second behind the giant Dutchman Maarten van der Weijden. </p> <p>In the women's volleyball, meanwhile, the US are now a set up and 22-14 in the second. Cuba are on the brink.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.23am</strong> Bad news for the Germans in the Tornado sailing as they have apparently capsized, having been in a bronze medal position. </p> <p>That leaves Germany on 11 golds, eight silvers and nine bronzes. I mean, why even bother...</p> <p>Ha ha. Only joking. That is a very good effort by the Germans. </p> <p>Still to come: Britain's Andrew Simpson and Iain Percy have a great chance of a medal - could well be gold if they catch some Swedes - in the Star class. Will that be Britain's 17th gold? Stay with us to find out.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.28am</strong> China are so far ahead in the medals' table that it is not even funny but the Americans have had a good day. They beat China in the women's beach volleyball final and are now two sets and 3-1 up in the third in the women's volleyball semi-final. </p> <p>The American decathletes Bryan Clay and Trey Hardee are also doing well after two events, the 100 metres and the long jump.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.32am</strong> Disappointing news reach us from the world of modern pentathlon, where Britain's Nick Woodbridge is now occupying last place - 36th - after the shooting and fencing. </p> <p>On a brighter note, though, Sam Weale has climbed to 19th. </p> <p>Three events to go so there is still hope of, er, a top-15 finish. </p> <p>And with that I would like to thank everyone who has been with me for these past four hours. I will now leave you in the very capable hands of my colleague Paolo Bandini to take you through the rest of the morning's action.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.38am</strong> Hello. I fear Marcus was exaggerating just now - both about the capability of my hands and the length of the stint I will be pulling, but I shall try at least to tide you over for the next couple of hours. Anyway, let me begin by telling you that Britain's Leigh McMillan and Will Howden did win the tornado medal race, which is actually rather misleadingly named, as they still don't win an <em>actual</em> medal. Instead Spain, who finished third in this race, take gold, Australia silver and Argentina bronze.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.42am</strong> Right then, the Star class race - also known as <strong>the one Britain really ought to get a medal in</strong> - is up next and should start at 6.45am. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it'll probably start late.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.46am</strong> British broadcasting values mean I'm now watching the beach volleyball final for the third time this morning. It was a good game, actually, but really not <em>that</em> good. I know Marcus has been asking for suggestions for new sports Britain could actually win at London 2012, so let me throw my hat into the ring by nominating hoopla and bingo (we'd have as good a chance as anybody else ...)</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>6.54am</strong> Over in the indoor volleyball, USA have finally finished whupping Cuba by three sets to love. It's been a good morning for America, actually - earlier they got their first ever table tennis quarter-finallist when Wang Chen beat South Korea's Kim Kyung-ah 4-3.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7am</strong> We're now hearing that the Star won't start before 7.15. In better news my colleague Chris just found some left over cake by the water cooler.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.07am</strong> Am I the only one who thinks Britain need to stop winning medals now. I think we can safely say that Team GB have made their point, beaten Australia, and generally done everything else they set out to achieve. Doing any more now is a) just showboating and b) only going to make it impossible for London 2012 to live up to Beijing 2008.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.12am</strong> A good start - Britain have jumped out ahead of Sweden, who they need to beat to win gold.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.16am</strong> As seems to be the way in the early stages of any sailing race, nobody's really sure what's happening. Britain and Sweden both had good starts, but they're taking very different lines, so it's hard to know whose is better, or who has better wind.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.20am</strong> \"Nobody is faster than [Britain's] Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson in this sort of wind,\" asserts Ben Ainslie from the warm safety of the commentary box. Except the Swedes Ben, they're now definitely ahead of Britain. As are five other teams.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.24am</strong> \"One sport we actually might be quite good at is sea rowing,\" parps Angus Doulton. \"It takes place in real boats, as opposed to pampered cockleshells, on real water, and is currently practised to my knowledge in several parts of the south-west and maybe other places too.\" That sounds awfully close to a serious suggestion Angus, but I'll let you off because the Olympics could do with at least one sea-based sport which need never be cancelled because of a <em>lack</em> of wind.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.28am</strong> It's getting interesting in the Star, where Percy and Simpson have snuck in front of the Swedish team. They're getting a bit of help from the French, too, who have wedged themselves in-between the Swedes and one of the buoys, just to be difficult.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.32am</strong> The Beeb's commentary have forgotten the first rule of fate-tempting and started writing off the Swedes altogether, saying that the real challenge for Britain now is just making sure they finish in the top six. In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/21/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Jacques Rogge has accused Usain Bolt</a> of not showing enough respect to his opponents. Personally I couldn't agree more, but my only confusion is that Mr Rogge seems to be presenting this as a bad thing ...</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>7.36am</strong> Percy and Simpson successfully navigate their way around another flourescent pink floating postbox (\"mark\") and Ainslie seems pleased. \"Inspired by watching the madison in the velodrome on Tuesday, we've come up with a new track event for 2012,\" chimes Max Hogg. \"A 10km race with a 400m sprint every five laps. Up to 20 teams can race, with each team having two runners - a 400m specialist and a long-distance runner. It's run like a relay, with the long-distance runner (we'll call her 'Paula') handing over the baton to the 400m specialist (let's say 'Christine, for argument's sake) for the sprints. It would be fairly hardcore and fiendishly complicated, and seeing as GB seems to do quite well in the cycling, which is similarly hardcore and incomprehensible tactically, we'd be sure of gold.\" Indeed Max, especially if we follow the current madison principle of compiling a rulebook that nobody understands, thereby allowing us to simply crown ourselves winners at the end regardless of how many laps we have/haven't run.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>7.42am</strong> It's <strong>gold for Great Britain in the Star class sailing</strong> as Percy and Simpson bounce home ahead of Sweden and safely inside the top six. This is now officially the most successful Olympic regatta ever for Great Britain.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>7.49am</strong> That was Britain's 17th gold in Beijing. \"We're fully six gold medals ahead of the Germans,\" parps Adrian Chiles in a triumphant BBC studio. More importantly, we're now more than twice as good as Michael Phelps.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7.56am</strong> Britain's Daniel Awde was 31st of 32 at last check in the modern decathlon after a rotten effort in the shot put.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.04am</strong> With the BMX postponed until tomorrow on account of all the rain, there's now a fair old lull before Britain are up for another medal. Phillips Idowu is in with a good shout in the men's triple-jump final, but that isn't scheduled to start until 1.25pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.08am</strong> \"Have any of Bolt's competitors complained at this lack of respect,\" demands Simon Thomas. \"If not, then everyone else (except me) should shut up about it. I was watching the finish of the woman's triathlon and the Aussie winner clearly broke into a smile 50m before the end, the hard hearted Sheila. Typical Aussie lack of respect for the others who were nearly 100m behind.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.12am</strong> The great untold story of the 2008 Games has to be the music being played on the public address systems at China's various Olympic stadiums. So far this morning I've already heard Who Let the Dogs Out, the Macarena and Cascade's Every Time We Touch, among others. Last week there was Cotton Eye Joe at the Water Cube. For an emerging world power China really could be more advanced in the music stakes.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.20am</strong> Good news from the modern pentathlon - Nick Woodbridge, who was 36th and last after two events, just posted the second fastest time in the 200m freestyle swim. I have no idea what this means in terms of the points table, but if I find out I'll be sure to let you know.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.23am</strong> The Beeb's just noticed that Phillips Idowu is wearing the same athlete's number - 1809 - as Dame Kelly Holmes wore in Athens in 2004. All concerned seem fairly certain this means he's nailed on for gold.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.25am</strong> My small army of of helpers inform me that Woodbridge is up to 32nd after that swim (8.20am). Glorious. His Team-GB-mate Sam Weale, meanwhile, is 11th after three events.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.30am</strong> \"We should be wary of criticising the Chinese authorities' choice of music,\" points out Gary Naylor sagely. \"I suspect somewhere in the bowels of TV Centre, the sole BBC employee not racking up the expenses in Beijing is splicing together scenes of joy and tears for a Games closing montage. If they use Spandau Ballet's 'gold' as the soundtrack, my telly might not survive.\"</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>8.37am</strong> There's a bit of a love-in unfolding on the Beeb, where Team GB's entire sailing squad seem to be indulging in a giant group hug. Upon reflection this probably isn't live - several bad words have just been bleeped out. Are the sailors Britain's most foul-mouthed Olympic team?</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>8.42am</strong> All those who doubted that Phillips Idowu's assigned number 1809 would ensure him a gold medal (8.23am) might want to take note. Oliver Pattenden has just emailed me to point out that Alfred Tennyson was born in 1809.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.48am</strong> Britain's Tim Brabants is through to the final of the 500m men's flatwater kayaking after finishing third in his semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.56am</strong> Here's Paul Savage. \"Perhaps all this crass music is something else we need to focus on ahead of London 2012,\" he offers. \"What are the worst tracks we can think of to play at any event in 2012? What music would put off our competitors most? We must be good at this ...\"</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>9.04am</strong> No British action to speak of right now, so I've taken the opportunity to discover men's flatwater canoeing. The canoes themselves truly are a feat of engineering - I have genuinely no idea how a boats that small can support men that large without sinking. Brazil's Nivalter Jesus romps to victory in the first semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>9.07am</strong> More good news for Idowu (8.23am). \"Charles Darwin was also born in 1809,\" points out Adam Hendry. \"Could things be looking any rosier?\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9.11am</strong> Right, this MBM needs a fresh pair of legs, so I'm going to stand down and allow my colleague Les Roopanarine to take over. Thanks for all your emails.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>9.17am</strong> As Paolo heads off for some well-earned sleep, a very good morning to one and all. Let's start on a musical note: \"The answer to Paul Savange's question <strong>(8.56am)</strong>,\" writes Tim Maitland, \"is... Aaaaaaaa....gaaaaa...do-do-do.\" No arguments there, Tim.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>9.22am</strong> Nottingham paddler Lucy Wainwright is through to Saturday's 500m flatwater kayaking final after going one better than Tim Brabants by finishing her semi-final in second place. Paul Savage, however, has other things on his mind. \"There's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/21/painted_ladies_of_the_pool_are.html\">a great article on the synchronized swimmers by Marina Hyde today</a> that all should read,\" says Paul. \"If its staying, why not have men's synchronized swimming in 2012? There should be lots of scope for sequined swimming trunks? And again lots of music choices for themes!\" I shudder to think.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.33am</strong> Wainwright will face stiff competition in the final, if the powerful performance of Hongyan Zhong, local favourite and winner of the other semi, is anything to go by.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>9.42am</strong> \"I heard on the radio this morning that 1809, Idowu's number, reflects the Olympic triple jump record of 18.09 metres, which is obviously far more portentous than it having been Ms Holmes's number last time around,\" writes Steven Thomas. \"But it was Nicky Campbell who said this, so it's likely to be complete nonsense. Fact-check, please.\" The Olympic record is indeed 18.09, Steven - it was set by Kenny Harrison in 1996. Britain's Jonathan Edwards holds the world record, with 18.29; thanks to everyone who emailed in about this!</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>9.46am</strong> And now the news you've been waiting for: in the first of the men's K2 500m semi-finals, Canada have come through just ahead of Poland and Denmark. Meanwhile, Britain's latest sailing victors, Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson, have received their Star class gold medals at Qingdao.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.06am</strong> \"I'm all for men's synchronised swimming,\" says Jack Lee, \"provided there's a compulsory element where they have to headbang underwater to classic 70s/80s rock (AC/DC, Bon Jovi etc.) That would be fantastic.\" Which brings us neatly back to the colourfully-coiffed Phillips Idowu. \"I'm moving my mortgage onto Idowu,\" chirps Doug Falconer, \"unless he turns up with gold hair as is speculated. Look at what that did to the Romanian football team at the 98 World Cup.\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>10.20am</strong> Not much going on at the moment in terms of British interest, but I can tell you that Korea's Jae Young Koon is locked in an unusually rally-free third round table tennis clash with Austria's Werner Schlager. Oh, and they're dropping like flies in the modern pentathlon, where there have been two fallers already this morning.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>10.27am</strong> If you require proof that it's been a rainswept day in Beijing, that high jumpers go through some highly unusual warm-up routines, or that America's Mike Hazle looks very scary indeed when hurling the javelin, then check out our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/21/olympics2008?picture=336816851\">gallery of day 13's best pictures</a>.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>10.34am</strong> Not content with turning the air blue in their post-victory interviews, Britain's sailors have given Team GB sailing manager Stephen Park a celebratory dousing over in Qingdao harbour. Not that being thrown in has done much to dampen Park's spirits after Britain's six-medal haul. \"It's absolutely fantastic, I'm over the moon with the medals and the gold for the Stars is the icing on the cake,\" enthused Park, still basking in the warm afterglow of the Star class victory secured by Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson earlier today.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>10.42am</strong> While we're on the subject of medals, this from James Fergusson: \"If the Americans are putting themselves at the top of the table because they have the most medals of any colour, does that mean they are only celebrating Michael Phelps as the second most successful <br>Olympian of all time? [Former Soviet gymnast] Larissa Latynina has 18, two more than Phelps.\"</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>10.50am</strong> \"Can you update us on the Britons in the modern pentathlon,\" writes Paul Binning, \"where Bristol City goalkeeper Chris Weale's less famous - hopefully until later today - twin brother, Sam, is aiming for a medal?\" I certainly can, Paul, although it's not great news: the man from Yeovil twice failed to clear a fence and picked up 224 penalty points, leaving him well off the pace with the top three still to ride.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>10.57am</strong> Doping has cast its unwanted shadow over the Games, with four horses - including Latinus, the mount of Irish rider Denis Lynch - suspended from tonight's showjumping final in Hong Kong. \"The FEI provisionally suspends all competitors who test positive in doping or positive medication cases at the Olympic Games in the interests of the integrity of the sport,\" said a statement from the International Equestrian Federation.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.13am</strong> Taekwondo enthusiasts will doubtless be interested to hear that South Korea's Son Taejin will face America's Mark Lopez in the final. Taejin came through 7-6 against Taiwan's Sung Yu-chi, while Lopez beat Peter Lopez, of Peru, 3-1. Meanwhile, this from Martin Smith: \"Can someone tell me why both losing semi-finalists ins sports like boxing and wrestling get bronze medals, and why there is not a third-place playoff? Was the decision made by the same person who thought of banning sports day at school in case people cry when they don't win?\"</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.20am</strong> It's 0-0 after the first quarter of the women's football bronze showdown between Germany and Japan, although the Japanese have had the better of things so far. There's no score either between the Netherlands and Germany in the men's hockey semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>11.25am</strong> As confirmation filters through that Tony Andre Hansen, a member of the Norwegian team that won a showjumping bronze earlier this week, has been provisionally suspended from the Games along with Ireland's Dennis Lynch, Brazil's Bernardo Alves and Germany's Christian Ahlmann, Andrew Adams kicks off the equine quips: \"I'll bet those horses were long-faced when they found out they'd been caught.\" If you're eager to avoid any further horse-related comedy - and frankly, who wouldn't be? - check out <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/21/birds_nest_view_live_minutebym_1.html\">Andy Bull's live blog from the Bird's Nest Stadium</a>.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> It's 0-0 between Germany and Japan at half-time in the women's football, so the bronze remains firmly up for grabs. And it's still scoreless between the Netherlands and Germany in the men's hockey semi-finals. Meanwhile, Tom Morgan sheds some light on Martin Smith's boxing query (<strong>11.13am</strong>): \"The reason boxing has two bronzes is because there is a chance of losing by knockout in the semi-finals, leading to concussion and so on - which would make it dangerous to fight again. On the other hand, in the wrestling it's just because they're big girly men in leotards.\"</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.08pm</strong> Britain's Steph Twell has just started in the first heat of the women's 1500m semi-final. She's biding her time at the back of the field after lap one.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.10pm</strong> Twell is moving up the pack, and she's in fifth as they hit the final lap.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.12pm</strong> A comfortable victory for Maryam Yusuf Jamal in 4:05.14, with Spain's Natalia Rodriguez second and Siham Hilali of Morocco in third. Twell finishes sixth. Only the first three in each heat go through by right, with the three fastest losers making up the field for the final. So it's eyes down for the second heat, which has just started.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.18pm</strong> Britain's Susan Scott could only manage fourth in the second heat, but a slow race was good news from Twell's perspective - she remains in contention for now.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.24pm</strong> Lisa Dobriskey is next up for Team GB, and at the end of the third lap she's at the back of the six-strong leading group.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.25pm</strong> Mixed news for Britain after the third heat: Dobriskey storms down the finishing straight to come in third but, with the fastest qualifiers coming from this heat, Steph Twell's hopes of a place in the final are over. \"I felt really good and really relaxed. I thought I'd have to run quick to qualify but it's great,\" says a slightly breathless Dobriskey. Nancy Jebet Langat won the heat in 4:05.30.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.32pm</strong> Jamaica's Veronica Campbell-Brown wins the women's 200m final in 21.74, successfully defending her crown. America's Allyson Felix takes silver, with Kerron Stewart making it two out of three for Jamaica. Meanwhile, Tim Wood reckons he's spotted something that the walking judges didn't. \"Prompted to look at the day 13 pictures by the 10.27 MBM entry I wondered if anyone had made the same analysis as me of the walkers outside of the Bird's Nest stadium (picture 3/13). It looks to me as if the walker 3rd from right is actually in mid-air while in full stride. Isn't that classed as running?\"</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.42pm</strong> Britain's Goldie Sayers throws 65.75m to claim a national record in the women's javelin. It leaves her lying third for now. Moments later, Usain Bolt receives his gold medal for that unforgettable 200m victory, celebrating in characteristically effusive style.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.48pm</strong> \"I am in need of help as to how to fill my days next week,\" writes Matthew Williams, \"when I will no longer be able to stare at my screen pressing the refresh button to see if some fat Georgian has successfully sat on a Turk to win a gold. Counselling required.\" Speaking of being sat on by large Georgians, Revazi Mindorashvili won gold in the men's 84kg freestyle wrestling earlier with a 3-1 win over Tajikistan's Yusup Abdusalomov, who later collapsed en route to a news conference. After a 20-minute delay during which he failed to recover, he was whisked away for medical attention. Let's hope he'll be ok.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>12.55pm</strong> Moving away from the Bird's Nest, Norway will face either Hungary or Russia in the women's handball final after edging past South Korea, while Germany have beaten Japan 2-0 in the women's football to take bronze. Substitute Fatmire Bajramaj scored both of Germany's second-half goals, since you ask.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.04pm</strong> Wilfred Bungei wins the first of the men's 800m semi-final heats, but defending champion Yuriy Borzakovskiy surprisingly trails home in third and now faces an anxious wait. Meanwhile, Germany are through to the men's hockey final after beating the Netherlands 4-3 on penalties. No surprises there, then.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.12pm</strong> In the second of the men's 800m semi-final heats, Algeria's Nabil Madi claims a shock victory while both Britain's Michael Rimmer, who finishes sixth, and Sudan's Abubaker Kaki fail to qualify for the final. \"As soon as I set off I knew I was in trouble - I couldn't go any quicker and I just felt really, really bad all the way round,\" said Rimmer, who was recently hit by a stomach bug. Borzakovskiy's elimination is also confirmed.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> There'll be no javelin medal for Britain's Goldie Sayers, sadly, a fluffed final throw costing her the bronze. In the men's 4x100m, both Nigeria and the USA are out, with a dropped baton the culprit in both cases, Trouble for Matthew Williams, meanwhile. \"Just spotted that my namesake has written in to the MBM [<strong>12.48pm</strong>]. Unfortunately this means that any of my colleagues who are slacking by following the coverage will now think I'm slacking even more by taking the time to write in. Which I now am, obviously. But I wasn't earlier.\"</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.37pm</strong> You might have thought that the demise of the USA and Nigeria would be good news for Britain. Not so. Craig Pickering made a complete dog's breakfast of picking up the baton in the home straight, straying way beyond the line. It'll be a miracle if we're not disqualified. Still, all is not lost. The men's triple jump final is underway, and Phillips Idowu has safely negotiated his first jump with a comfortable 17.51m. That leaves him in first place.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.42pm</strong> Britain lie second in that heat for now, but was the changeover ok? \"Looking at the video, perhaps not,\" says Craig Pickering with some understatement. \"If we're kicked out it's my fault - not Marlon's - I'm just sorry, so sorry. It's not been a very good Olympics for me.\" Marlon Devonish, who refuses to blame his team-mate, admits: \"If we don't go through we'll be bitterly disappointed.\" And so say all of us.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Britain's 4X100m disqualification is confirmed. Let's hope the girls can do better - they're about to get underway in the first of the women's heats.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong> Britain survive a shaky first changeover to finish second and qualify for the final. But there's further mayhem as the USA crash out, dropping the baton again to complete an ignominious men's-women's double.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> Over in the sand pit, Portugal's Nelson Evora has claimed the lead from Phillips Idowu with a jump of 17.56m.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.56pm</strong> Phillips Idowu can't wrest the lead back, his second jump scoring 17.31m. \"Looking at the American sprinters is making me think Michael Phelps is very lucky that there is no baton in the swimming relays,\" quips Jon Blum as Colin Jackson helpfully explains that Craig Pickering \"went too early.\"</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> Fresh from her 200m win, Veronica Campbell-Brown streaks down the home straight to complete a comfortable win for Jamaica in the second women's 4x100m heat in 42.23. Russia come second, with Germany third. But there's plenty more dropped-baton action as Trindidad &amp; Tobago, Canada and France add further momentum to the botched changeover theme.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> \"I'm sick as a dog,\" says Goldi Sayers, reflecting on her fourth-place finish in the women's javelin. \"I feel that they started the clock on my final throw a bit early, and I wasn't ready. But no excuses. If that doesn't make me train hard over the winter then I don't know what will.\" Bad news too in the triple jump, where David Girat has recorded a jump of 17.52m to shunt Phillips Idowu into third. On a brighter note, though, Tasha Danvers has just received her women's 400m hurdles bronze.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.18pm</strong> Phillips Idowu eclipses Nelson Evora's mark of 17.56m with a gigantic third-round leap of 17.62m. He celebrates regaining the gold medal position with a joyous little jig; quite right too.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> \"I like that traffic cone they put at the end of the triple jump board to prevent the participants from starting their run-up prematurely,\" writes Elliott Wilson. \"A high-tech Olympics with an endearing M25 touch.\" It does little to obstruct the Bahama's Leevan Sands, who jumps 17.59m to move into the silver medal position behind Phillips Idowu.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.26pm</strong> An American 1-2-3 in the men's 400m final, but not in the order you might expect. LaShawn Merrit takes gold in 43.75m, almost a second ahead of Jeremy Wariner, the defending champion and red-hot favourite. David Neville flings himself head-first over the line to take silver, but Brit Martyn Rooney fails to make an impression after betraying his nerves with a false start. \"I'm disappointed,\" said Rooney. \"I just didn't do it on the day. I've got 2012 and 2016 - I'm only 21 and I've got to do better next time.\"</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.35pm</strong> \"LaShawn ran a fantastic race but I don't know what happened to everyone else,\" says Michael Johnson, the former champion and reigning world record holder. \"It was a horrible 400m. I don't know what happened. Jeremy's first 200m was great, but he did not attack the third 100m at all and then on the home stretch he looked extremely fatigued and just wasn't able to respond. He gave up at the end and I'm very disappointed with him for that.\"</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.39pm</strong> Nelson Evora reclaims the triple jump lead with a gravity-defying leap of 17.67m. Phillips Idowu has got his work cut out here.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.44pm</strong> After Leevan Sands fails to make inroads on the silver and gold positions with an effort of 17.26m, Phillips Idowu gets a red flag. He remains in second.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.50pm</strong> Cuba's Dayron Robles confirms his status as the man to beat n the men's 110m hurdles with a comfortable victory in 12.93 seconds. America's David Payne took silver in 13.17m, narrowly edging out compatriot David Oliver.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.55pm</strong> Phillips Idowu paces around pensively as triple jump leader Nelson Evora prepares to make his penultimate effort. It's a modest 17.27m. As Idowu casts off his track-suit top, he suddenly looks a whole lot more confident.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.58pm</strong> So here we go. Phillips Idowu ignores the men's 400m final medal ceremony and launches himself down the track ... only to fall short with a disappointing effort. He'll get one more attempt at unseating Evora.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>3.02pm</strong> \"Here I am in southern China, the home of the Olympics, watching Chinese TV,\" writes Jayne Skipper. \"According to your updates, the triple jump is on. Are you sure? I have seen perhaps two jumps. We are seeing lots of bird's eye views of the stadium and interesting close-ups of runners with five minutes to go before running, but no triple jumping! So far this Olympics, I have seen two of our medals live and no ceremonies.\" That sounds far from ideal, Jayne. Still, chin up - I'd imagine it makes for less unsightly viewing than that last attempt from Idowu.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong> Leevan Sands has to settle for the bronze after recording a no-jump, so Idowu is guaranteed at least a silver.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>3.12pm</strong> Phillips Idowu gets his run-up all wrong, losing his rhythm completely as he approaches the board before landing a meagre 15.41m. He takes the silver - but looks crestfallen.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>3.14pm</strong> Nelson Evora can't better his effort of 17.67m, but it matters not: he takes gold for Portugal. Idowu, though, looks inconsolable as Darren Campbell attempts to offer a few words of solace.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>3.27pm</strong> Moving away from the Bird's Nest, it's goalless after 70 in the women's football final between Brazil and the USA.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>3.50pm</strong> With seconds remaining of normal time in the the women's football final, Amy Rodriguez capitalises on a Brazilian defensive error to break through on goal. The gold medal beckons, but her attempted chip is saved and we're set for extra time. What that will bring is anyone's guess: to a woman, the players look absolutely exhausted.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>4.01pm</strong> Breakthrough in the women's football final! The USA's Carli Lloyd charges through the Brazil defence before unleashing a fierce left-footed shot from just inside the box. It bounces awkwardly in front of the goalkeeper before rippling the side netting - advantage America.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>4.15pm</strong> Time for a quick show jumping update. Despite completing a flawless round a little earlier, Ben Maher thuds into no fewer than five fences to slip out of medal contention. That ends British interest, but a desperately close contest is set to be decided by a jump-off. Or possibly a typhoon, since there's apparently one looming.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>4.25pm</strong> Back to the women's football final, where the USA's Carli Lloyd almost sealed a brace - and the gold medal - with four minutes of extra time remaining. Lloyd beat the keeper only to see her effort clatter the post. It almost proves costly for the USA when Brazil subsequently go close from a corner.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>4.29pm</strong> The USA clinch gold for the third time amid scenes of unbridled joy on the American bench. It's tears all round for Brazil, though, with the goalkeeper particularly distraught. That brings us to the end of today's marathon stint. Thanks for all your emails and apologies that we couldn't use them all.</p>"
