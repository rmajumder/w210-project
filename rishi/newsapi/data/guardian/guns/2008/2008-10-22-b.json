Luckily it proves to be a work of genius. It's a game in two parts, with a conventional (but achingly cute) platformer which combines cunning physics with a gloriously simple control system. But the most amazing element is a full-blown, unbelievably powerful yet easy to use editor, which lets you make your own levels to post on the PlayStation Network.

  "<p>Back in the days of no-holds-barred advertising by Madison Avenue's finest, anything went. Drinking alcohol made you sexy, smoking cigarettes was good for your lungs and every washing powder contained a magic ingredient that made your whites super-white.</p> <p>And guess what? Those days are back, at least for green <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising\">advertising</a>. As more and more customers demand environmental responsibility from companies, few large corporations with any sort of public profile now dare to enter the marketplace without a blizzard of sustainability audits and low-carbon-emissions targets. But that being so, the risk of being conned by slick corporate \"greenwash\" has never been greater, as the volume of complaints to the <a href=\"http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/\">Advertising Standards Authority</a> (ASA) testifies.</p> <p>The green claims coming from corporations can be absurdly general. Nearly everything we buy these days seems to be \"sustainably sourced\" or \"environmentally friendly\". Sometimes, though, they are crazily specific. Virgin Trains declares: \"Our Pendolino trains emit 76% less CO2 than cars or domestic flights.\" But which cars, which flights, and how full are the trains? </p> <p>Or plain bonkers. One brand of bottled water says its product contains \"300% more oxygen\". </p> <p>In August, the ad industry's watchdog, the ASA, rapped oil company Shell's knuckles for trying to claim, in an advertisement in the Financial Times, that its $10bn investment in sucking tar sands out of the Canadian midwest was a contribution to a sustainable energy future. Tar sands contain bitumen. It takes a great deal of energy to turn them into something you can put in a fuel tank. Overall, the emissions from mining, refining and burning tar sands are between three and 10 times greater than for conventional oil. Shell's sleight of hand was to use the much-abused word \"sustainability\" to imply a green agenda when what it was really on about was keeping a sustainable flow of fuel out of its forecourt pumps. The ASA cried foul.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, the agency also upheld complaints against Renault for branding its Twingo an \"eco\" car and picturing it with leaves blowing out of its tailpipe, even though its emissions are among the worst for a car of its size. </p> <p>Advertising, says the ASA, \"should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable, green, non-polluting and so on\". </p> <p>In the real world, we have to admit, things can be nuanced. Lots of corporate claims - about carbon neutrality, for instance - hang on exactly what activities are being audited. Take Manchester airport, which was outed in a recent report from the sustainable development organisation, Forum for the Future. Last year the airport's owners pledged to make the airport carbon-neutral, with one small caveat: the target does not include the 200,000-plus flights into and out of the airport each year. As Forum for the Future observed, \"this jars somewhat\".</p> <p>And what are we to make of Fiji Water's claims to be cutting the carbon footprint of its water by 25% and offsetting the rest? \"Every drop is green,\" it says. But isn't the whole idea of bottling water on a remote South Pacific island and shipping it to your dinner table just a tiny bit barmy? </p> <p>Equally questionable are the claims of financial institutions. Back in the days (oh, only a few weeks ago) when the City of London was concerned with something other than day-to-day corporate survival, the City of London Corporation launched a City Climate Pledge, under which finance houses would pledge to \"measure and monitor\" their carbon footprint. Good for them. Perhaps a few will follow the lead of HSBC, which has developed close links with the environment group WWF and has claimed since 2005 to be the world's first carbon-neutral bank. </p> <p>But the pledge looks suspiciously like greenwash. Companies simply have to fill out a form detailing their CO2 plans and they can use the pledge logo. \"Companies using the logo will be recognised as exemplar sustainable businesses [able to] attract consumers who are becoming more discerning about the credentials of businesses they deal with,\" says the flyer. Not bad for just filling out a form. Especially as there doesn't seem to be any follow-up or auditing process involved.</p> <p>But as with the efforts of Manchester airport and Fiji Water, there remains a rather large elephant in the living room. The carbon footprint of finance houses is not about whether they offset executive flights or put double glazing in the boardroom; it is about their investment decisions. The press release put out by the City of London said the pledge would \"encourage City organisations to use their global influence to affect the behaviour of companies around the UK and the world\". Could the City be about to impose a freeze on cash for tar sands or coal-fired power stations? Not so fast. The pledge itself makes no mention of this. </p> <p>I would have expected City institutions to be falling over themselves to sign up to the pledge. But 11 months after companies were first asked to sign the pledge, and three months after its public launch, the pledge's website is still promising that a list of signatories \"will be available shortly\", and further inquiries revealed that just one company - Deutsche Bank - had so far completed registration. Right now the pledge looks like a one-day PR wonder to green the City's image, with no substance at all. Or maybe they are all just a little busy right now. </p> <p>To try to keep up with the welter of environmental claims, test the green spin and spot the green frauds, the Guardian is launching today a regular online column, Greenwash, and calls on readers to submit their examples of the fraudulent, mendacious, confusing, ignorant or just daft claims jostling for our attention.</p> <p>Along the way, we may get to the heart of a dilemma that faces us all. Can we shop our way to sustainability? Are some products so green it is better to buy two of them rather than one? Or are our own consumer lifestyles, suffused in greenwash, the problem? Is there really no alternative to putting away our credit cards, pulling on our thickest jumper and heading for the hills?</p> <p>We won't be limiting our investigations to corporations - we'll have politicians in our sights, too. Scraping away at the green patina on the new-look, Zac Goldsmith-inspired Conservative environmental policies, puncturing Brown's grumpy greenery and unpicking the carbon contortions of the coal-loving Celts. And now that both Barack Obama and John McCain claim environmental credentials, we'll be looking for greenwash at the White House too.</p> <p>And we won't forget that, even in the corporate world, greenwash is not just a defensive mantra to help maintain business as usual. Some people are out there pushing the environmental agenda with sinister intent. Take, for example, the green rebranding of Steptoe and Son.</p> <p>Last year the EU introduced the charmingly named WEEE directive, which stands for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The aim is to prevent millions of tonnes of toxic TVs, personal computers, toasters and other electronic goods being dumped into landfill each year. Instead, they have to be recycled. You may not have noticed this because there are no laws stopping you putting that laptop into your dustbin. But corporations and retailers are charged with making sure most of our electronic waste gets recycled. The question is how.</p> <p>Some of this stuff is making its way to a handful of hi-tech metals recycling plants in Europe. But most is going to the developing world. Often it has paperwork claiming it will be refurbished and re-used, but nobody has the resources to police the system, so in practice much of it ends up in primitive workshops in India and west Africa and China, where it is stripped out, boiled up, dunked in acid or smashed to smithereens by unskilled, low-paid and frequently child labour. I have seen this \"recycling\" industry at work in Delhi, where barefooted children as young as eight dunk circuit boards in barrels of acid to remove traces of copper. </p> <p>Last month, a charity called Computer Aid tried to blow the whistle on this. Computer Aid is one of the few organisations that is genuinely and safely refurbishing and reusing old computers, many of them going to schools in Kenya. It fears this \"good\" and socially responsible recycling will be undermined by the bad guys. Why is this happening? Partly because factories in India badly want the metals in your old computer. And partly because too many European companies have a no-questions-asked policy towards every broker and cowboy willing to take troublesome waste off their hands. As one industrial supplier told me last year, \"A lot of these guys don't even have addresses, just mobile phone numbers.\"</p> <p>Recycling may be a new term, but the trade is not new. Until the 60s, recyclers plied the streets of Britain with a horse and cart collecting old stuff that could be sold on. The characters in the television show Steptoe and Son were the archetypes. They have been succeeded by a generation of car-crushers and cable-burners. Nobody called it green then: now they do. But the same wide boys are in charge, so if anybody has their mobile numbers, do please get in touch.</p> <p>We are too ready to suspend our critical faculties with anybody claiming to be green. But a great deal of recycling is not quite what it seems. What happens to recycled glass bottles, for instance? As we post them in the recycling bin, we presume they go to make new bottles and cut out the energy cost of making new glass from sand. My local supermarket bin in south London proudly proclaims that recycling one glass bottle \"saves enough energy to power a TV for 20 minutes\".</p> <p>Well, it would if they turned the glass back into new bottles. But it turns out that often they don't. Much of London's recycled glass is actually crushed and sold to construction firms as a substitute for sand, or an ingredient in a substitute for asphalt such as Glasphalt - \"specially treated so it won't puncture tyres,\" as one recycling website puts it. That's a relief, but how many assiduous recyclers trying to do their bit for the environment realise they are actually helping build new roads?</p> <p>How many more green scams, cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there? We want to name and shame them before the whole green movement gets a bad reputation. \"Green\" has another meaning after all - naive. And we cannot afford that.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/23/energy\">Greenwash: Fred Pearce on the con of green electricity</a></p> <h2>How to spot a fake</h2> <p>It's greenwash if it's ...</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ludicrously general</strong><br>All claims for products being environmentally friendly or pollution-free should have evidence that clearly supports them. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Overspecific</strong><br>Be on guard against numbers or other \"facts\" that can only be true in specific circumstances, such as Virgin Trains' claims to have 76% fewer emissions than planes or cars <strong>(see main feature)</strong>. Often these come with a discreet asterisk referencing an obscure study - look the study up, or ask the Guardian's new Greenwash column to do so on your behalf. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Reliant on nature pictures</strong><br>Most pernicious, perhaps, are attempts to green products by association, such as cars driving through verdant meadows. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Backed up by a tame boffin</strong><br>Companies like to spotlight their researchers working on renewable energy, even if it makes up less than 1% of their business. Anybody can keep a tame boffin: to mean something, such research must be a significiant part of the company's business. (Incidentally, has anyone met a researcher? We would like to hear.)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Simply absurd</strong><br>If a claim sounds absurd, it probably is. Inside knowledge can help you blow the whistle, but a nose for the absurd is just as good. </p> <h2>How to spot the real thing</h2> <p>It might just be true if ...</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>What the company says matches what they do</strong><br>Rob Harrison of Ethical Consumer thinks the most important question is: \"Is their position consistent right across the group?\" Some car manufacturers advertise their green cars but continue to lobby for lower carbon-reduction targets. Look for companies who match what they say and do, such as Peugeot, one of the only car manufacturers likely to come in under the European emissions targets in 2010. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The company is in partnership with an independent ethical organisation</strong><br>Forming a partnership with an independent organisation is voluntary and doesn't have to mean much: groups such as the Ethical Trade Initiative or the Carbon Disclosure Project have little power. All the same, it's an indicator of willingness. Some NGOs are more picky: their validation is, therefore, worth more. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They take that extra, obsessive step</strong><br>Evangelistically green companies such as Lush, Co-operative Food or Sawdays can never resist the chance to talk about the environment, and they've all taken radical steps within their own organisations. Lush uses minimal amounts of packaging and gives money to anti-road groups, Co-operative Food has clad its entire HQ in solar panels, and Sawdays publishers operates from zero-carbon offices. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They are green innovators</strong><br>DIY Kyoto came up with the Wattson, a device for measuring how much electricity your house is using. BSkyB, headed by James Murdoch, has brought in the auto-standby device, which senses if the box hasn't been used in the two hours after 11pm, and automatically goes to standby.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They set themselves targets</strong><br>Quantifiable targets set for some specific time in the future - \"we will reduce our water use by such and such by 2010\" - are an indicator of seriousness: they are handing you and the press a stick to beat them with if they miss the target. In January, Tesco, for example, pledged to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% by 2020. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They take action even if it may harm business</strong><br>Marks &amp; Spencer's decision to charge for plastic bags, British Gas's encouragement of reduced use: these are not immediately obvious comfort zones for money-making enterprises. You can be cynical, or you can clap. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They have been audited</strong><br>Some companies get a third party in to check they're doing it right: Eurostar called in Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to go over their plans with a toothcomb before they kicked off their big Tread Lightly initiative. Some companies - the Guardian, for example - are so obsessive they will even audit their social report. This could be seen as just showing off. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They make it easy for you to find all this out </strong><br>If you can't easily find the information, be suspicious and ring up the company. Other possible sources of info: Ethical Consumer, FTSE4Good Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and the ASA (which may be considering cases against the company you're looking into).</p> <p><strong>Bibi van der Zee </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Please send your examples of greenwash to <a href=\"mailto:greenwash@theguardian.com\">greenwash@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Barnsley building society is to merge with the Yorkshire building society after becoming the latest victim of the Icelandic banking crisis. </p> <p>The mutual had \u00a310m deposited with Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, the British arm of Iceland's biggest bank, and Heritable Bank, which is part of Landsbanki.</p> <p>Kaupthing and Landsbanki were nationalised a fortnight ago after the Icelandic government stepped in to take control of the country's collapsing banking sector.</p> <p>Barnsley said that although the deposits could be covered by general reserves, its board had concluded that the long-term interests of members would be best served by a merger with the Yorkshire.</p> <p>Though the deal will not yield a windfall for Barnsley members, Yorkshire said it would consider making an ex-gratia payment if money held by the Icelandic banks was recovered. The money - minus recovery costs and tax - would be given to people who were savers or borrowers with the Barnsley on October 21 and who remain members of the enlarged group until the payment is made. </p> <p>Steve Mitchell, acting chief executive of Barnsley building society, said: \"The board has made a very positive decision to lead the society into a more secure future as part of a larger society, through merger with Yorkshire building society, which shares our values and has a strong commitment to members, staff and local communities.\" </p> <p>The merger, which has been approved by the boards of both building societies, has to be cleared by the Financial Services Authority, but is expected to be completed on December 31. </p> <p>The combined society will be called the Yorkshire building society, but the Barnsley's name and branches will be retained. Barnsley mortgage customers who are on the group's standard variable rate (SVR) of 7.19% will be moved to Yorkshire's SVR, which is 6.9%. Savers will also move to the Yorkshire, although retaining the Barnsley brand, and rates and terms will be similar or better than those of the Barnsley. </p> <p>Iain Cornish, chief executive of Yorkshire building society, said the deal would benefit Yorkshire members \"as well as strengthening even further our position in our heartland area\". </p> <p>Barnsley, whose assets totalled \u00a3276m at the end of last year, is Britain's 34th-biggest society, with 60,000 members and eight branches. Its operations are dwarfed by those of the Yorkshire, the UK's third-largest building society, which boasts more than 1.3 million members, 136 branches, 64 agencies and assets of \u00a320.5bn at the end of last December. </p> <p>The merger makes the Barnsley the latest small building society to seek the protection of a larger player. </p> <p>Last month, Nationwide agreed to merge with the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies after the pair racked up losses during the first half of the year. Earlier this year, Chelsea building society merged with the Catholic building society, one of the country's smallest societies.</p> <p>British savers, universities and local councils have all been hit by the Icelandic bank collapse. It emerged last week that 123 local authorities in England and Wales had a total of \u00a3919.6m stuck in its banks.</p> <p>The IMF, which has been in talks with the Icelandic government for more than a week, is understood to be close to unveiling a $6bn (\u00a33.7bn) rescue package. The fund is likely to contribute $1bn, with further support from Scandinavia and Japan. Last week, Iceland drew on swap facilities with Denmark and Norway, tapping \u00a3150m from each to kickstart currency markets. Britain has offered a \u00a3100m loan to help it repay British depositors in Landsbanki, one of the three nationalised banks.</p>",
  "<p>The interest in George Osborne's meetings with Oleg Deripaska has revived questions for the Conservatives over a big source of their funding, Lord Ashcroft.</p> <p>Osborne and Andrew Feldman were adamant that the party would in any case not have accepted any money from the Russian oligarch, since he does not live in the UK and, while it could be channelled legally through a British company which he owns, the two declared it \"would not be appropriate to accept such a donation\".</p> <p>This invites the question: is it \"appropriate\" for the Conservatives to accept money from Ashcroft, one of the party's largest single donors and appointed deputy chairman shortly after David Cameron was elected leader. When the question was put to senior party officials yesterday, they declined to answer.</p> <p>Ashcroft is British, but it is unclear whether or not he lives in the UK or in Belize, the central American tax haven where he resided for many years and where many of his businesses are based.</p> <p>He promised to return to the UK after his nomination for a peerage was rejected in 1999, in part because of his status as a tax exile. The then Tory leader, William Hague, wrote to Downing Street asking for a change of heart because Ashcroft intended to be resident in Britain \"in order properly to fulfil his responsibilities in the House of Lords\". Hague added: \"This decision will cost him (and benefit the Treasury) tens of millions a year in tax, yet he considers it worthwhile.\" However, in 2004, five years later, Ashcroft's \"location of main residence\" was declared in the Lords expenses register to be still in Belize.</p> <p>Ashcroft has repeatedly refused to say whether he has returned or not, and it remains unclear whether he pays any UK income tax. Asked last year about domicility and tax status, his spokesman refused to answer, insisting it was \"a private matter between him and the Inland Revenue [sic]\". Asked whether he might decide to discuss the matter, the spokesman replied: \"Hell is more likely to freeze over.\" Asked again yesterday, he replied: \"Nothing's changed.\"</p> <p>With interests in telecoms, finance, and cleaning and security, Ashcroft, 62, has a personal wealth estimated at \u00a3900m. He has been a substantial donor to the Conservatives for years; in three months preceding the 2005 election one of his firms gave \u00a3540,000 to Tory candidates in more than 60 constituencies. Since the law changed eight years ago, caps on spending by parliamentary candidates come into force only once an election is called, enabling them to spend freely between elections.</p> <p>Most donations are through Bearwood Corporate Services: in August last year he donated \u00a3125,000 via this company, and a further \u00a3300,000 six months later. Bearwood's capital is reported to have been channelled from Belize through a series of other companies. This is entirely legal, and all of Ashcroft's donations comply with party funding law.</p>",
  "<p>The high court yesterday condemned as \"deeply disturbing\" a refusal by the US to disclose evidence that could prove a British resident held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay was tortured before confessing to terrorism offences.</p> <p>The court said there was \"no rational basis\" for the American failure to reveal the contents of documents essential to the defence of Binyam Mohamed, who faces the death penalty.</p> <p>In a particularly damning passage, Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones said claims by Mohamed's lawyers that the US was refusing to release the papers because \"torturers do not readily hand over evidence of their conduct\" could not be dismissed and required an answer.</p> <p>The judges said they were unaware of any precedent for such serious allegations against \"the government of a foreign friendly state and our oldest and closest ally\" as those made in this case.</p> <p>The US had not provided any explanation for its conduct, though it had had \"ample time\" to do so, the judges said. </p> <p>Thomas and Lloyd said the documents provided the \"only independent evidence\" capable of helping Mohamed and his defence. Suppressing the material \"would be to deny him the opportunity of timely justice in respect of the charges against him\", which was a principle dating back to \"at least the time of Magna Carta and which is a basic part of our common law and of democratic values\".</p> <p>They said David Miliband, the foreign secretary, conceded there was an \"arguable case\" that Mohamed had been subjected to torture and inhuman treatment. Yet Miliband also wanted to suppress relevant documents, not because they would reveal any intelligence operations but because the US claimed that if they were disclosed serious harm would be done to \"intelligence sharing\" between the UK and the US.</p> <p>The judges said it was clear Britain had \"facilitated\" Mohamed's interrogation when he was unlawfully detained in Pakistan before being secretly rendered to Morocco, Afghanistan, and then to Guant\u00e1namo. The US was using confessions made after two years of unlawful \"incommunicado detention\" on charges where the death penalty might be sought, the judges said yesterday.</p> <p>They noted that a military prosecutor at the US base had recently resigned in protest against the treatment of prisoners, including the use of a \"frequent flyer programme\". The judges described this as a \"euphemism for a sleep deprivation programme\". They added: \"This is a practice which the United Kingdom expressly prohibits.\"</p> <p>Charges against Mohamed- including that he was involved in a dirty bomb plot - have been dropped, allegedly to prevent the US from revealing torture evidence. The US authorities now planned to charge him with other offences, the judges noted yesterday.</p> <p>The judges took the extraordinary step of inviting the media to challenge previous decisions to hold many of the case's hearings in camera. \"Although the argument took place in closed session,\" they said, \"the issue is one of considerable importance in the context of open justice [and] to the rule of law.\"</p> <p>They suspended proceedings pending a case in the US courts, where defence lawyers are also trying to force disclosure. That federal court, the British judges said yesterday, might be given explanations about US conduct \"denied to this court\".</p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, the director of the charity Reprieve, described Mohamed's treatment by the US as a \"litany of misconduct\". </p> <p>\"First they tortured him, then they held him for more than six years without trial, now they want to cover up evidence that could set him free,\" he said. \"What is the point of a 'special relationship' if the UK government cannot secure basic justice for Mr Mohamed?\" </p> <p>Richard Stein, one of Mohamed's lawyers, said: \"The grave concerns expressed by the court about the dealings of the Americans in this case are not surprising, given the torture Mr Mohamed has suffered. This underlines the British government's duty to do more than gently nudge its ally across the Atlantic when it comes to criminal acts taken against a British resident.\"</p> <p>Mohamed, 30, an Ethiopian national and British resident, was held in Pakistan in 2002, when he was questioned by an MI5 officer. He was later secretly rendered to Morocco, where he says he was tortured by having his penis cut with a razor blade. The US subsequently flew him to Afghanistan and he was transferred to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in September 2004.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Attempts to get the UK courts and parliament to take notice of the case of <strong>Binyam Mohamed</strong> began more than three years ago. <strong>Clive Stafford Smith</strong>, director of the charity Reprieve, told the Guardian about a hunger strike by <strong>Guant\u00e1namo </strong><strong>Bay </strong>prisoners, including Mohamed, who was rendered to the US base in Cuba. Mohamed's case was taken up by the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, chaired by <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong> <strong>MP</strong></p> <p>UK citizens and residents held at Guant\u00e1namo were <strong>released </strong>between 2005 and 2007, but Mohamed was kept. This summer, the high court heard about the way the US and British governments tried to stop the release of <strong>evidence </strong>about his case. Defence lawyers argued that <strong>MI5</strong> misled MPs about his treatment. In August, in an interim judgment, the high court ruled that MI5 had participated in Mohamed's <strong>unlawful interrogation</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Families evicted from their homes on an island in the Indian Ocean lost their long-running battle to return yesterday when the law lords ruled by a majority of three to two in favour of the Foreign Office.</p> <p>The islanders, some of whom had travelled from their current home in Mauritius to hear the decision, were removed from the Chagos archipelago to accommodate the US military base on Diego Garcia in the 1970s.</p> <p>They greeted yesterday's ruling with dismay. \"We are deeply disappointed,\" said the Chagossians' leader, Olivier Bancoult. \"But we will never give up.\"</p> <p>Lords Hoffmann, Carswell and Rodger found in favour of the Foreign Office in its appeal against earlier court rulings that the Chagossians had a right to return. Lords Bingham and Mance dissented from the majority decision. </p> <p>In his judgment, Hoffmann said the Chagossians had been removed with \"a callous disregard\" for their interests, but that did not affect the case now. </p> <p>\"The right of abode is a creature of the law. The law gives it and the law may take it away,\" he wrote, adding: \"The deed has been done, the wrong confessed, compensation agreed and paid.\" </p> <p>Hoffmann said the UK government's obligations to the Chagossians ended in 1982 when it paid them compensation. He noted that the government had said it was acting \"in the interests of the defence of the realm, diplomatic relations with the US and the use of public funds in supporting any settlement on the islands\". </p> <p>But Bingham, in his dissenting judgment, wrote: \"It is not, I think, suggested that those whose homes are in former colonial territories may be treated in a way which would not be permissible in the case of citizens in this country.\" </p> <p>He challenged the government's claim that security issues had to be considered. \"Despite highly imaginative letters written by American officials to strengthen the secretary of state's hand in this litigation, there was no reason to apprehend that the security situation had changed.\" </p> <p>The Chagossians, their legal team and their supporters lambasted the decision. \"How can we be expected to live outside our birthplace when there are other people living there now?\" said Bancoult.</p> <p>The Chagossians are now considering taking their case to the European court of human rights. They are also looking at other ways to influence the government, which has spent \u00a35m fighting the action. </p> <p>\"The government has finally scored a narrow victory, but the victory has been achieved at a great price,\" said Richard Gifford, the solicitor who has acted for the Chagossians in the action, originally launched in 1998.</p> <p>He said that it was now up to parliament and public opinion to play their part so that the Chagossians could return.</p> <p>David Snoxell, the former high commissioner to Mauritius, said: \"This would have been a great opportunity to right a great wrong and wipe out a national shame.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, said the government's decision to appeal against the earlier decisions had been vindicated. He added: \"It is appropriate on this day that I should repeat the government's regret at the way the resettlement of the Chagossians was carried out.\"</p> <p>The Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, a leading campaigner for the Chagossians, said he was saddened by the ruling and added: \"I hope the foreign secretary understands that Olivier Bancoult will never give up.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 24 2008. An editing error gave the impression that the Chagossian islanders all come from the island of Chagos. In fact, they come from a number of islands, including Diego Garcia, in the Chagos archipelago. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Parents are increasingly employing lawyers to pursue a place at their child's chosen school, legal firms say. They report more families wanting advice on deciphering the application process, filling in forms and even when to move house into a catchment area to guarantee a place. </p> <p>Parents more commonly seek legal advice to help in an appeal when a child is rejected. The use of solicitors through the entire application process is a sign of some families' desperation, parents' groups said. </p> <p>Council leaders, who oversee applications to most state schools, said that legal advice was not necessary and accused firms of profiteering. School applications reach fever pitch this week with the deadline in most areas on Friday. </p> <p>Ian Jones, a lawyer who specialises in school admissions in Leicester, said: \"Parents want to know when they need to move house to secure a place at the best schools, they want to know how close they have to be to the school to guarantee a place, and they don't want any margin of error. </p> <p>\"They want advice on how to get in right from the beginning.\"</p> <p>Jones, who charges up to \u00a3400 to draft appeal papers, insisted that many parents felt they needed the representation to navigate the complex and emotionally charged process. </p> <p>\"They feel the system is stacked against them and they need support to get through it.\" </p> <p>Anita Chopra, of Match solicitors in London, said: \"No lawyer can guarantee your child a place at the school you want but we can help in giving them the best opportunity they can have.

  "<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the TUC are wrong to condemn Peter Mandelson, the business secretary, for looking again at the government's proposals to expand the right to request flexible working (Mandelson under fire over flexible working proposals, October 22). Flexible working's growth in recent years has been driven by a range of factors. Employers see a link with improved recruitment and retention, higher productivity and profitability and lower rates of absenteeism, while employees, looking for a better work-life balance, have been quick to demand more flexible arrangements. </p> <p>In a recent survey, 86% of Institute of Directors' members said that their organisation operates flexible working. So where is the evidence that new rights need to be enshrined in law? All that the government would achieve by expanding the right to request is the imposition of new costs on small businesses at the worst possible moment. If millions of new people are given a statutory right, as is currently proposed, any requests from these individuals would have to be dealt with under a formal procedure. This will eat up precious management time - particularly in small firms where there is no personnel manager. If the government wants small businesses to focus on getting through the tough times ahead, it needs to drop these plans now.<br><strong>Alistair Tebbit</strong><br>Head of employment policy, Institute of Directors</p> <p>As half-term approaches for children across Britain, it is regrettable that employed parents are hearing from Peter Mandelson that their access to flexible working options may become more restricted. In these times of economic insecurity, there is a risk that employed parents may become too fearful to ask for flexible hours to spend with their children. Concerns about the welfare of infants and older children should not be forgotten in future efforts to promote economy productivity. Britain is still at a very early stage in developing a modern work-family policy. It would be a shame to nip its growth in the bud, especially as other governments, for example Australia's new Labour government, are looking to our flexible working options as a way forward.<br><strong>Professor Margaret O'Brien</strong><br>Centre for Research on the Child and the Family, University of East Anglia</p> <p>Mandelson's proposal will seriously undermine the government's policies to increase employment rates for disadvantaged groups, such as lone parents and disabled people. As the government report, Ready for work: full employment in our generation, states: \"The government recognises that the availability of flexible working will be important in enabling lone parents with older children, like other parents, to juggle work and family life.\" </p> <p>In any case, since the new regulations could offer demonstrable benefits for people with childcare responsibilities, at no apparent \"cost\" - the \"right\" to request a change in working patterns would be at the discretion of the employer - the backing down on this commitment seems to be a symbolic gesture to the \"burdens-on-business\" lobby with no real winners.<br><strong>Dr David Etherington, Dr Anne Humbert, Dr Ian Roper, Professsor Suzan Lewis, Dr Mary Hartog, Heike Schroeder, Professor Eleanor Kofman, Dr Jeff Evans</strong><br>Gender Research Group, Middlesex University Business School</p> <p>The report from the Office for National Statistics (Parental splits hit children hard, October 22) is further evidence of the massive impact that stressful life events have on a child's mental health. Increasing numbers of children are forced to deal with problems that cause them anxiety and sadness, yet we are offering little support to help them cope - with very real and profound consequences for their emotional wellbeing. Support in schools is patchy, specialist mental health services are overstretched, and it sometimes appears that as a society we have forgotten the basics of bringing up mentally healthy children. <br><strong>Simon Lawton-Smith</strong><br>Head of policy, Mental Health Foundation</p>",
  "<p>Gazprom has produced record quarterly figures on the back of a 72% increase in the value of exports to Europe but the heavily indebted Russian group warned that the credit crunch could hit its cashflow.</p> <p>The world's largest gas producer earned $18.5bn (\u00a311.4bn) from European sales in the first quarter, triggering more harsh criticism in the west about its decision to establish a gas cartel with Iran and Qatar that could drive up prices further.</p> <p>Domestic sales at Gazprom grew by only 2% and are now worth less than half its European ones, while sales to former members of the Soviet Union slumped by 20%. Pre-tax profits rose by 30% to more than $14bn but the company, which has a monopoly on exports from Russia, admitted that the global liquidity squeeze would make life harder.</p> <p>\"Such circumstances could affect the ability of the group to obtain new borrowings and refinance its existing borrowings at terms and conditions similar to those applied to earlier transactions,\" Gazprom said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Deteriorating operating conditions for borrowers may also have an impact on management's cashflow forecasts and assessment of the impairment of financial and non-financial assets.\" </p> <p>Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller, said this month that he saw no short-term risks from the global financial crisis as his company was enjoying record gas prices and had no urgent need to borrow. Analysts also said the company's debts of $40bn were still relatively small, given the profits generated and the scale of its business.</p> <p>But Artyom Konchin, an analyst at Aton Capital in Moscow, said Gazprom's share price had slumped 70%, valuing the group at $100bn, in part because it had failed to convince investors that the scale of investments it wanted to make could be justified at a time when demand could be hit by the global economic slowdown. \"Minority investors in particular want to know where the value is coming from,\" he added.</p> <p>Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, announced on Monday that it was establishing a \"big gas troika\" with Iran and Qatar. It was described by the Iranian oil minister Gholamhossein Nozari as a \"gas Opec\".</p> <p>David Clark, a former special adviser to the Foreign Office and a chairman of the UK-based Russia Foundation, said he was alarmed by the move. \"It is a clear attempt by Russia and other countries to increase their leverage and use energy as a geopolitical weapon. It is time the European Union ensured that Russia was bound by a rules-based relationship that it had signed up to with the energy charter treaty.\" </p> <p>Clark said it was ominous that the three countries involved in the potential cartel specifically talked about liquefied natural gas (LNG). \"They clearly realise that LNG offers gas-importing countries different supply options and is an area they want to control,\" he added.</p> <p>The European commission said it would expect to be notified of any move to create such an arrangement, which could prompt the EU to revise its energy policy. </p> <p>\"In principle, the commission is against cartels for the sale and marketing of products, and hydrocarbons are no exception to that,\" the commission's energy spokesman, Ferr\u00e1n Tarradellas Espuny, said. \"We believe the best conditions for the sale of a product such as gas are a free and transparent market.\" </p> <p>Two of Europe's biggest gas distributors, GDF Suez and E.ON, said the troika could be useful. </p> <p>G\u00e9rard Mestrallet, chief executive of GDF Suez, France's biggest gas utility, said: \"We have the feeling that the forum project is not necessarily a cartel - if it was we would condemn it - but that it is a place for dialogue and we would be prepared to regard it favourably.\"</p> <p>Bernhard Reutersberg, E.ON Ruhr gas chairman, said he was not \"really\" concerned as his company was shielded by long-term supply contracts.</p>",
  "<p>Rude, crude and extremely profane, Rudy Ray Moore, who has died aged 81, was an underground legend of black American entertainment. \"Underground\" remains the correct adjective to describe Moore's success, as he never came near to achieving mainstream appeal. But as a stand-up comedian, film star and singer he enjoyed decades of acclaim among urban African-American communities. If his profanity-laced comedy routines and no-budget movies appeared to be made strictly for ghetto audiences, he more recently became an icon of ironic urban hip to those nostalgic for black American culture before MTV.</p> <p>Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, the first of seven children, Moore grew up doing menial work to help his family. After moving to Cleveland, Ohio, he worked as a kitchenhand and began to study tap dance. Aged 17, he moved to Milwaukee and got a job dancing in a nightclub as Prince DuMarr. This led him to join a travelling black variety show where he did his apprenticeship as a singer, dancer and comedian. Enlisted into the US military, he served in Korea and West Germany, where his performances earned him the nickname \"the Harlem hillbilly\". He settled in Seattle and began recording in the proto-rock'n'roll style then ascendant. His records never sold in sizeable quantities but he remained determined to succeed as an entertainer and moved to Los Angeles in 1959. That year he issued his first comedy album, Below the Belt. </p> <p>Moore released two more comedy albums in the early 1960s, although his popularity remained confined to South Central Los Angeles, where he worked part-time in a Watts record shop. It was there that he encountered a wino named Rico who would, in exchange for soup money, recite ribald toasts featuring a character called Dolemite. Moore was so impressed by the response Rico received from customers that he worked the wino's stories into his own material. This led to him winning much stronger responses from audiences and he developed into what he described as \"the first X-rated comedian\". His repertoire now focused on him performing rhyming toasts where he developed outlandish, amoral characters who boasted about just how bad they were. Sometimes backed by musicians, he came to be seen as a pioneer of what in the 1990s became known as gangsta rap. His 1970 comedy albums Eat Out More Often and This Pussy Belongs to Me both made it onto the Billboard R&amp;B charts and demonstrated just how large his following had become. </p> <p>Moore continued to release comedy albums regularly, their explicit content and covers marking him out as an entertainer who pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable. He would record his albums at home, inviting friends and serving drinks, and when everyone got merry, started reciting material. This won him the title \"king of the party records\". </p> <p>In 1974 he invested his $100,000 savings in the film Dolemite, in which he played his super-bad creation. Mixing low comedy with blaxploitation-style action and racial politics, Dolemite stands as one of the most amateurish films ever to win a large audience. Independently distributed, it proved a hit in black American communities and Moore went on to star in a series of films - The Human Tornado, Petey Wheatstraw: The Devil's Son-in-Law, Monkey Hustle, Disco Godfather - during the 1970s. Small and pudgy, he was an unlikely action hero, yet by serving up a formula of sex, violence and comic crudity, he won a loyal following. Aware that he lacked the talent that had taken Bill Crosby and Richard Pryor to wider audiences, he revelled in his comic persona of the ghetto avenger Dolemite. </p> <p>As tastes changed Moore retreated to working in nightclubs, still issuing albums featuring both comedy skits and him singing soul standards. The huge popularity of gangsta rap in the 1990s founds many rappers citing him as an influence, and he made guest appearances on several rap records and videos. This led to a demand for his material, and many of his albums and films were reissued. He again began appearing in low-budget films and in 2002 starred in The Return of Dolemite, picking up where he had left the character in the late 1970s. A 1992 profile in the Washington Post described him as \"an astounding renderer of 'toasts' - elaborately boastful, profane and scatological tales of life in the old-style urban sub-culture of pimps, prostitutes, gamblers and badmen. His husky, down-home voice is ideal for it.\" The superstar rapper Snoop Dog said: \"Without Dolemite, no Snoop.\" He is survived by his daughter and his 98-year-old mother. </p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong> Rudolph Frank \"Ray\" Moore, comedian and actor, born March 17 1927; died October 19 2008</p>",

With Troicki's serve vulnerable Murray took the set and a run of six straight games put him 3-0 ahead in the second set before his opponent troubled the scoreboard again. Murray ambled to the finish line but his next match is unlikely to be such a stroll. He will face the gifted young Latvian Ernests Gulbis, who beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-0, 6-2.</p> <p>The third seed, Fernando Verdasco, whom Murray beat 6-2, 6-3 in the final last year - his first trophy following a wrist injury that saw him miss the French Open and Wimbledon - reached the second round by defeating Karlis Lejnieks of Latvia 6-1, 6-3.

  "<p>The conviction of the former Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, on a corruption charge over the purchase of land in Bangkok and his sentence in absentia to two years in prison were expected. The surprise was that the supreme court had allowed Thaksin and his wife Potjaman to leave the country in the first place. They were bailed on the pretext that they should attend the opening of the Olympics in Beijing, but they flew to London instead where they have been ever since. At the time, it was speculated that the couple had been given the nod to flee into exile in the hope of ending the political crisis. But the crisis continues.</p> <p>Thaksin's second stand-in as prime minister, his brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat, is in as much trouble as his predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, who was sacked for moonlighting as a television chef. In the four weeks since he was sworn in, Somchai has been unable to enter his office, which is occupied by opposition supporters, and has been forced to climb over fences to escape protesters. Yesterday he fled an angry crowd who threw shoes and water bottles at him while shouting \"murderer\" - and they were state workers. If the rule of law were to be upheld, Britain should extradite Thaksin and his wife back to Thailand, the opposition should release its stranglehold on government and Samak should call fresh elections.</p> <p>But none of the likely outcomes are particularly appealing. Behind Thailand's violent political crisis lies a deeply entrenched power battle between an urban royalist and liberal elite, represented by the opposition, the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), and the rural poor, championed by Thaksin's People Power Party (PPP). Both claim to represent the popular will -and each time an election is held Thaksin's party wins - but neither are democratic. PAD want a parliament that is 70% appointed and 30% elected, but a return of Thaksin is also troubling. He earned his popularity in the north and north-east of the country with low-cost healthcare and village development funds, but the populist tycoon has no legitimacy to rule while he has a case to answer before a court of law.</p> <p>The more violent PAD demonstrations become, the easier it will be for Thaksin to claim before a British court that the charges against him are politically motivated. Calling another election would also do little to alter the underlying dynamic, as a new government would inevitably contain pro-Thaksin factions. But allowing the violence to escalate would only create the conditions for another military coup. There have been 10 of them since 1932. The only solution is to find a leadership capable of bridging the Thai social and political divide, but it is not yet evident where that will come from.</p>",
  "<p>The Osborne affair highlights again what muddy waters donors, politicians and party officials have to navigate when making, accepting and declaring political donations. These stories come from nowhere, dominate reporting and destabilise reputations at alarming speed; the Osborne affair has brought back memories for me of the glare of publicity I faced 11 months ago over anonymous donations to the Labour party.</p> <p>People who give time and money to politics should of course be governed by strict rules. It is also right that, in a democracy, donations should be declared and have a legitimate source. In the Osborne case, it seems the Tories felt they had to pursue the donation by whatever means they could before dropping the idea. It goes to show how desperate parties are for money, even when riding high in the polls.</p> <p>The competitive pressure in seeking donations is exacerbated, I believe, by a diminishing pool of donors. Some are simply not willing to risk having their lives and motives raked over by the media. I fell into that category, until December last year when I chose to reveal - after a week of media sleuthing had failed to find me - that I was an anonymous donor to the Labour party.</p> <p>Many donors will now be asking if giving to political parties is worth the bother; and many politicians will be asking if meeting rich people is too risky. But there is a wider question: is this state of affairs good for our democracy?</p> <p>Too many people are falling foul of the current system. As I know from my need to consult lawyers, the law is complex and unclear. There is too much scope for the media and rival politicians to cast doubt and innuendo without proving any breach of the law. I don't blame the media: the public are in on this pantomime because they like nothing better than to see politicians and the people who fund them on the rack.</p> <p>It would not surprise me, now that both major parties have been stung over the the past year by scandals, if agreement on a new set of funding rules is soon reached.

  "<p>Where were you when Obama was shot? The line we pray we will never have to say. A line that I have hesitated even to write, as if the mere inscribing of the words could invite calamity. Yet the fear preys on the back of our minds, as we see Barack Obama plunging into those crowds. I have now watched weeks of election coverage on the 24/7 television news channels in the United States, in the course of which every tiniest feature of the campaign has been examined to exhaustion, but not once have I heard this mentioned. Yet almost every day I have a private conversation in which the subject comes up, especially when talking to journalists.</p> <p>Is this self-censorship of the media right? Should I not even be writing this? There are unstable, suggestible people out there. Experts may argue about the psychological impact of media coverage of such subjects, but it clearly has some. Earlier this year, a blogger pointed out that \"assassinate Obama\" had that day appeared on a list of Google's top 100 search items.</p> <p>She suggested that newspaper stories about the danger had increased the number of such Google searches - and that her own blog might do the same. As may this column.</p> <p>Yet to ignore this subject completely, never to mention in print what so many are thinking, is to miss something important. Only against this dark background of dread can you appreciate the full irresponsibility of the turn the McCain-Palin campaign has taken towards attacking Obama's character, biography and patriotism - attacks which, in other contexts, we would not hesitate to describe as \"character assassination\". The charge made by Sarah Palin that he has been \"palling around with terrorists\"; the automated calls associating him with \"domestic terrorist\" William Ayers; the underhand insinuation that he is alien, un-, or even anti-American; rhyming Obama with Osama; the absence of instant rebuke when some idiot at a Palin rally cries out \"terrorist!\" or even \"kill him!\".</p> <p>Palin supporters might retort: this is America, not namby-pamby Europe. We fight tough, and we fight to win. A little gouging of the eyes as you roll in the dirt is just fine, in this land of real men. But more responsible Republicans disagree. They argue that, if you really put \"Country First\" - John McCain's campaign motto - you should not travel along this road and risk stirring those demons. It's no accident that Obama was given secret police protection unusually early in the primaries. Watching Colin Powell's measured and eloquent endorsement of Obama, many will have recalled that one widely reported reason Powell himself did not run for president was his wife's fear that he would be assassinated. No serious analyst would dispute that the threat to Obama, however effective his secret police protection, is greater than it would be to a white candidate.</p> <p>Of course the nutters, xenophobes and racists are out there anyway. The point is that nobody should ever be able to claim, with even a shadow of plausibility, that the Republican campaign has given them even a hint of encouragement. I feel it important to record that I have heard several white Republicans say, with real feeling, what a great thing it would be for the US to have a black president.</p> <p>This criticism of the nasty turn taken by the McCain-Palin campaign would lose some of its force if the Obama campaign had been launching comparable attacks on the character and biography of the Republican candidates. Now the Obama camp has done its share of negative campaigning, and the excellent factcheck.org finds that the candidate himself has sometimes misrepresented McCain's policy positions. But he has never resorted to such lowdown personal attacks. In the last presidential debate, he even heroically refrained from questioning Palin's qualifications to be president.</p> <p>His quiet message was: let the American people judge. So the McCain-Palin campaign has been unilaterally playing with fire.</p> <p>The stakes in this election grow higher by the day. It feels like watching a poker game with huge piles of chips accumulating on the table. Both the potential loss and the potential gain are enormous. On the upside is not just the symbolic breakthrough of electing the first African-American president - and a child of the world carrying with him the hopes of the world. It's also the arrival in the world's most important job of someone who has the potential to do it very well.</p> <p>I did not always think this. Last year he still looked inexperienced. But Obama has gained stature through every challenge. For a start, he has shown amazing stamina and strength. Due to the long drawn-out primary contest with Hillary Clinton, he has been campaigning for nearly two years, non-stop. Through all the ups and downs of the campaign, and the financial crisis of recent weeks, he has been cool as a cucumber and steady as a rock. These are qualities we'd like to see in a president.</p> <p>In the debates, he was dignified, well-informed and grownup, making a grimacing McCain look like the temperamental youngster. He greeted the old fighter pilot's attacks with an ironical smile that visibly drove McCain nuts. He has the kind of cryptic detachment that is an asset to any chairman. Personally, he seems centred and rooted. You feel this a man who knows who he is. Not because he has always known who he is, like the heir to \"a long line of McCains\", but because for a long time he didn't - and then worked it out for himself the hard way, through the search recorded in the autobiographical Dreams From My Father. He has, so to speak, the rootedness of the uprooted.</p> <p>He has also cut some of the waffle that we heard earlier in the campaign. On policy, he has demonstrated a clear intellectual grasp of the issues, an ability to absorb and synthesise expert advice, and a consistent focus on a few strategic priorities: the economic condition of the middle class, healthcare, education, energy.</p> <p>Following the last debate, some of the instant reaction pundits on CNN complained that he had been \"professorial\" (what have they got against professors?). Then the polling came in, and it turned out that undecided voters rather liked professorial. After eight years of \"the kind of guy you'd want to drink a beer with\" (W), maybe someone who showed a clear understanding of complex issues would not be so bad. Without counting his chickens before they hatch, Obama is already preparing his personnel lists and policy options for government - determined to make a better start to his first term than Bill Clinton did. With every week, my respect for him has grown.</p> <p>Of course you never know until you know. Will he be bold enough? Can he make the unwieldy machinery of Washington, including his own party's representatives in Congress, work effectively to realise his strategic goals? But everything he has shown us this autumn suggests that he has the potential to be a very good president, perhaps even a great one.</p> <p>These are just some of the reasons why no American election since 1932 has had such a deep downside of fear and such a high upside of hope.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Once it was the Kremlin that came begging to people like George Osborne for cash. In the old cold war, it secretly sold off the Soviet Union's gold reserves to pay for desperately needed grain imports. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin sought bail-out after bail-out from the west, strongly backed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Now it is the other way round: Russia sits on a vast pile of cash, and we are selling principles and self-respect.</p> <p>Even before the financial crisis, London was the global leader in the respectability business: offering rich Russians the chance to turn their ill-gotten billions into prestige. Whether you wanted an entree to high society or to popular culture, British go-betweens and highly paid PR barons were willing to provide it. Buy a football team, sponsor a charity, or make a hefty donation to a posh boarding school - and you suddenly gain the right upmarket cachet. In exchange for what are to them trivial amounts of cash, the numerous oligarchs bought priceless respectability and safety. As fugitives from Russia found, Britain is a safe place - police and bodyguards work smoothly together; Russian extradition warrants count for little.</p> <p>In retrospect, that respectability was sold rather cheaply. With the war in Chechnya and imposition of state control on Russia's once pluralist media still in full swing, the British establishment decided that Russia under Vladimir Putin was a place to do business. The Russian tycoons - some of them ex-gangsters or ex-KGB - were seen as at worst a bit roguish. Tony Blair went for nights at the opera with his \"friend\" Mr Putin, the undertaker of Russia's political freedom. Britain's elite - the Rothschilds and Murdochs, even minor members of the House of Windsor - hobnobbed lavishly and sometimes lucratively with the \"new Russians\". </p> <p>Those who found their eyebrows rising or their stomachs heaving were told not to be so fuddy-duddy. Surely we should be glad that Russia was now roughly on the right track: rough capitalist diamonds are better than communist coals. Those who refused to play along soon got discreet warnings about the litigiousness of London's new elite.</p> <p>The banks, accountants and law firms joined the rush to the trough. Instead of upholding the principles - however shaky - on which our financial system is based, they have entered into the fray of Russian business, and connived in its attempts to subvert and evade those principles. Companies that are little more than criminal conspiracies, stealing billions of dollars from the Russian people for the benefit of unnamed shareholders, have their accounts signed off by our finest auditors. Top lawyers help them to conceal their identities and bombproof their business models. Bankers handle the cash and manage the dense web of offshore companies that conceal a trail pointing tantalisingly back to the Kremlin.</p> <p>In the shadows of Whitehall, officials are aghast at the way in which Russian money is buying friends and influence in our politics, public administration, independent regulatory bodies and businesses - particularly energy. All three parties have parliamentarians who are loyal members of the Kremlin chorus. British Tories, for instance, supported an attempt to make the former KGB man Mikhail Margelov president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. </p> <p>But the Lib Dems, and particularly Labour, have little to be proud of either, as the fracas over Oleg Deripaska shows. It is not just the unsolicited non-donation to the Conservative party that is so shocking. It is that anybody claiming respectability in British public life thought it appropriate to have even social dealings with oligarchs like Mr Deripaska - who rose to power and riches first in the aluminium business in the 1990s, which witnessed some terrifying violence, and then at the court of Mr Putin.</p> <p>But even so, it cannot have escaped the notice of Peter Mandelson or George Osborne that Mr Deripaska is a man unable to enter the United States. A private briefing from the FBI - easily arranged in London - would have revealed that American officials are unhappy with some of Mr Deripaska's business associates.</p> <p>Mr Deripaska's defenders point out that he has never faced any criminal charges and blame his visa difficulties on unsubstantiated allegations from rivals. Moreover, Mr Deripaska has himself denied any wrongdoing in this and other controversies. </p> <p>A brief chat to informed British officials should have made it abundantly clear to Messrs Osborne and Rothschild, as well as Lord Mandelson, that dealings with Mr Deripaska should be limited, formal and cautious.</p> <p>The British governing class has not just mislaid its moral antenna. It has also forgotten that Russia is a national security threat: a point underlined repeatedly and publicly by MI5. Nato is now making contingency plans to defend its members from Russian attack for the first time since the end of the old cold war. Yet on the home front, we seem to have surrendered without a fight.</p> <p>\u2022 Edward Lucas is the author of The New Cold War: How the Kremlin Menaces Russia and the West <br><a href=\"http://edwardlucas.blogspot.com\">edwardlucas.blogspot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The government is preparing an about-turn on its opposition to a list of \"crown-jewel\" events where ticket resales would be banned. It has hitherto resisted sports' pleas to add ticketing to its special rules for broadcasting such events.</p> <p>Although the resale of football tickets is illegal, the purpose of that legislation was solely to maintain fan segregation and prevent a return of violence in stadiums. So far cricket, tennis and rugby have lost the argument for similar laws against ticket resales for events such as the Ashes, Wimbledon and the Six Nations. </p> <p>There has been coordinated lobbying from the secondary-ticketing industry and free-market MPs who insist that, once sold, it should be legal to offer tickets to the highest bidder. But that has led to Britain having the most highly developed scalping industry in the world. </p> <p>The culture secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham</a>, has come to recognise the effect on sports' grassroots supporter base - where only the richest can afford entry, with children often priced out of landmark sporting events - and the implications for sports bodies' incomes. He has now called for a wide-ranging consultation that will look not only at protecting consumers against rising prices in an economic downturn but also at a \"crown jewels\" extension.</p> <p><strong>Arresting development</strong></p> <p>Simon Morris, the 31-year-old former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited\">Leeds United</a> director who mounted a bid for the club jointly with the London-based investment fund Redbus last year, has been taken into police custody on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money-laundering. His home and business addresses have been raided but the arrest has nothing to do with his time at Leeds or with the City of London police's inquiry into football corruption. The Crown Prosecution Service is not expected to decide whether to pursue the latter case through the courts until next month at the earliest.</p> <p><strong>Learning the hard way</strong></p> <p>Indecision by the International Paralympic Committee over learning-disability athletes is set to put fresh pressure on UK Sport's stretched budgets. All athletes with intellectual disabilities were excluded from Paralympics after Spanish journalists infiltrated Spain's learning-disability basketball team in 2000. Since then no athlete with a learning disability has benefited from UKS funding. The IPC last month said it might reinstate learning-disability athletes. UKS says it is committed to providing financial support after reinstatement but, with grants for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/olympics2012\">London 2012</a> being set by UKS next month and the IPC not deciding for another 12 months, the world body's delay will cause chaos in budget plans.</p> <p><strong>Racing's great escape</strong><br>The British Horseracing Authority was the biggest winner from the government's decision not to sell the Tote. A consortium of owners, racecourses and Tote management offered \u00a3320m for the bookmaker in the sort of leveraged-buyout model that has proved disastrous elsewhere. But it was the BHA's own chairman, Paul Roy, a former co-president of Merrill Lynch's investment-banking division, who first pressed government not to proceed with the sale. In an open letter to the sports minister, Roy said in July: \"In 35 years in the City I've never seen the markets in such disarray and financial institutions under so much pressure. I think we've all learnt that you shouldn't believe everything that investment banks tell you.\" Prescient indeed. </p> <p><strong>Russian in no rush </strong></p> <p>Alisher Usmanov's Red &amp; White Holdings - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal\">Arsenal's</a> largest single shareholder - will support all motions the board puts forward at today's AGM. The emollient approach comes despite Usmanov, left, being unable to hold meaningful talks with the board about its lock-down agreement. Amid the turmoil in Russian stockmarkets cynics will say he merely has more important diversions but Usmanov, having given up on a takeover bid, still insists he is \"very supportive of the board and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\".</p>",

  "<p><strong>My partner and I have been together for 15 years. About six years ago, he started a relationship with another woman, which I felt jealous about, but I decided that I loved him too much to leave him. He says he loves both of us equally.</strong></p> <p><strong>Recently, he told me that he is polyamorous and is now in a relationship with a third woman. He says he needs his space, and that he doesn't want to share his other lives with me. He is very caring towards me, except when it comes to discussing this issue. We enjoy each other's company, but I constantly feel the presence of a third or fourth person.</strong></p> <p><strong>I can't stand the constant dishonesty that he indulges in to accommodate these other two women - he says he needs to deceive me as he believes he will hurt me if I find out about the specifics of his other relationships. We constantly fight about this and have had a very unhappy past few years. I feel I have a right to know about his life, especially because, by his own admission, the main thing he discusses with the other women is how our relationship is going downhill.</strong></p> <p><strong>I feel as if my privacy is not being respected, and I am expected to just learn to live with the fact that he has relationships with other women. How do I decide whether I am ready to accept that he is \"different\" or whether I am too jealous to ever be happy in this situation?</strong></p> <h2>Polyamory needs mutual consent</h2> <p>I have had polyamorous relationships for 30 years, and believe polyamory is about openness and having multiple relationships with the knowledge and consent of your partner, rather than by deceit. You are in the passenger seat here and are clearly unhappy about the inequality in the relationship and lack of shared commitment - there's no point in trying to adjust to polyamory when it is not the fundamental problem. Start being more assertive now. Leave.<br><strong>JH</strong>, via email</p> <h2>He doesn't love you as you deserve</h2> <p>You have given your partner mixed signals about how accepting you are of his other relationships: you tolerated the first \"other woman\", and have complied with his lifestyle generally since. The problem here is not that he defines himself as polyamorous - it is that he is polyamorous and you are not. When will you realise that this man does not love or respect you in the way that you deserve? <br><strong>GPA</strong>, Birmingham</p> <h2>It's a power struggle you're losing</h2> <p>Anyone who insists on having more than one relationship does so because they relish the power they have over their partner(s) and also fear, or want to avoid, any real intimacy. He's not \"different\" - he's just trying to justify being deeply selfish. Could it be that this man wants to end his relationship with you and is hoping his unreasonable behaviour will prompt you to finish it? Few women would put up with what he is putting you through.</p> <p>Ask yourself if you enjoy the hurt and fighting at some level. What stops you from ending a relationship that causes you such distress?<br><strong>Name and address withheld</strong></p> <h2>Admit you're unhappy, and leave</h2> <p>Like you, I had a partner who had another woman. We both knew about each other, yet chose to \"share\" him. I left him last year and met a man with whom I am deeply in love and we are already planning to get married. I realised that despite my rationalisations about being able to handle a polyamorous relationship, I couldn't; it made me miserable and I realised I'm worth more. </p> <p>Fear of being alone seems to stop you from moving on, but you clearly want someone to love you and you alone. Don't settle for anything else.<br><strong>JM</strong>, London</p> <h2>It's not polyamory, it's infidelity</h2> <p>I wonder which friend of your partner supplied him with this jolly word, \"polyamory\" to explain his infidelity? Your passive reaction is understandable; in that you are afraid to let him go, but you're implicitly giving him permission to cheat. He is being completely disloyal to you as well as unfaithful. </p> <p>It isn't possible to have emotional intimacy with a group of people, and it sounds as if you are not even the one with whom he is most intimate. Summon up all your strength and self-esteem and make a new life without him. By the time I left my husband, he was also involved with two women and I had wasted years waiting for him to settle down. My life improved immeasurably when I faced up to the whole sorry mess and left. <br><strong>TS</strong>, Deal, Kent</p> <h2>There's no respect nor self-respect</h2> <p>He certainly isn't \"different\" - plenty of heterosexual men are tempted to give free rein to their egos and testosterone by sleeping with any woman who expresses an interest in them. However, most men choose not to, out of love and respect for their partners. </p> <p>This man regularly breaches your trust and privacy. He is showing you no respect because he senses that you have no self-respect. You should have shown yourself a little more love six years ago by ending the relationship when he started having affairs with other women. Don't allow him to do you any more harm.<br><strong>M</strong>, via email</p> <h2>Dishonest? He's just a hypocrite</h2> <p>Your partner is not indulging in dishonesty, it's pure hypocrisy. He has set a double standard for your relationship: you are not allowed to question his behaviour, but he is free to discuss your relationship with his other partners. How would he feel if you were having other relationships and discussing him with your lovers? Polyamory is based on mutual consent, but your partner has foisted this situation upon you, and you have agreed to put up with it. You deserve an equal and respectful relationship - you are being emotionally abused and controlled. Do yourself a favour and leave him to his other relationships. <br><strong>RN</strong>, via email</p> <h2>What the expert thinks - Linda Blair </h2> <p>I suspect many of us are \"polyamorous\". There's nothing unusual about feeling sexually attracted to more than one person at a time - in that regard, your partner's not unusual. However, the way people react to their amorous feelings is a measure of maturity, self-control and their sensitivity to others. In that sense, your partner is behaving selfishly, immaturely and insensitively. Not only does he allude to the manner in which he satisfies his sexual desires, but he also titillates you by telling you just enough to arouse your interest.</p> <p>Note that your partner never offers you anything except innuendo - it's likely that he creates this uncertainty to encourage you to goad him for more information. You need to step back and think about this pattern of interaction, and why you seek to maintain it. Would you feel happier if he told you everything? He's withholding, and you're pushing for something that won't really make you happy.</p> <p>I hope you can now see that there's a bigger problem between you than either the possibility of your partner's infidelity or your jealousy. Your relationship appears to be based on deliberate hurt and negativity. That is, you push him to tell you something you know will distress you, and in turn, he deliberately exploits the power you allow him to have over you, and for more than six years, you've done nothing to break this pattern. You've neither ignored his \"other life\", nor declared an ultimatum. His response has been to enlarge his scope for upsetting you. The result? Neither of you are happy, and yet you remain locked in confrontation.</p> <p>If you really want the situation to change, you must stop expecting that change to come from someone else. Your partner's already told you that he's not willing to behave differently. Therefore you must either accept things as they are, or decide to reject the status quo wholeheartedly.</p> <p>However, before you can make any truly satisfying changes, you need to take time to decide - in clear and definite terms - how you wish your life to be. The reason that this is so important is because change without direction is ultimately as unsatisfying as feeling stuck. One way to become aware of what you want is to \"fast forward\" and imagine how you'd like things to be in 10 or 15 years' time. How do you see yourself? How do you hope to be feeling? How do you imagine you'll be spending your time? Do you wish to be still locked in these circular altercations with your partner? Given that you're the one who must make any changes, what are the steps you'll need to take to achieve your vision for the future?</p> <p>In order to be happy, it's not necessary to have a partner or to have any particular person or thing at all. It is, however, necessary to assume responsibility for your own happiness, and to establish principles for the kind of life that will make you feel proud of yourself.</p> <p>Once you've taken the time to establish what's most important to you, you'll be able to decide whether you wish to remain with your partner, and if so, on what basis you're prepared for the relationship to exist.</p> <h2>Next week </h2> <p>I am 34, and have been with my partner for nearly three years. Although we argued a lot at first, we worked on our issues and now have a very \"comfortable\" relationship. We bought a flat together last year and co-exist very happily most of the time. I would like to have a baby and am conscious that I'm not getting any younger. However, for the past year I have fluctuated between wanting to have a child with this man, and not being sure whether he is The One.</p> <p>When we first met, I was unhappy, lonely and a bit wild, and he avidly \"rescued\" me. I thought at the time that the best thing for me would be a relationship, so I let him. I have since worried that my choice was propelled by need rather than desire, although I recognise that I am the happiest and most balanced I've been for years.</p> <p>The problem is our sex life has never been brilliant - at one point I even felt my sex life was over. I had a brief affair a few months ago, which assured me this was not the case, but I'm aware that sex isn't everything and don't want to repeat this behaviour. </p> <p>I love my partner, but I am not sure I'm in love with him. I'm plagued by the thought I could find someone who ticks all the boxes. But time is ticking, and I'm afraid that if we split up, I would miss him terribly and not find my ideal partner in any case. </p> <p>Should I stay and work at our relationship, or leave now before it's too late for each of us to find Mr or Mrs Right?</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Private Lives</strong> appears every Thursday.

  "<p>Earlier this week I spent a long and, in every sense of the word, sober lunch in a trattoria in Turin with fellow jury members at the world's longest running environmental film festival, Cinemambiente, now in its 11th year. Each of us had dutifully watched the 10 shortlisted films, but how do you even begin to choose between films about, say, the societal and environmental influence of the new market economy in Mongolia, the imperialistic excesses of western gold miners in Guinea or the men who break up ships by hand on the oil-stained beaches of Bangladesh for a dollar a day?</p> <p>After three hours of hearty, if sometimes circular, debate we finally settled on a winner. The Nuclear Comeback is a documentary by New Zealand filmmaker Justin Pemberton, weighing up the pros and cons of nuclear energy in a world that urgently needs to decarbonise its economy. On paper, this sounds quite a worthy film - dull, even - but Pemberton achieves a rare feat. God only knows how he persuaded them, but the authorities at Chernobyl allowed him to film inside the now abandoned, highly radioactive control room and inner core. It is thought to be the first time a western film crew has ever been allowed so far inside. In one angst-ridden scene, Pemberton turns to his guide and asks him whether it's still safe to proceed when the radiation detector pinned to his jacket begins to bleep furiously. He is casually told to walk on.</p> <p>Pemberton also manages to get nuclear officials in Britain to admit on film that no one really knows what to do with the spent nuclear fuel that will remain radioactive \"for at least 100,000 years\". Yet equal time is given to those who argue that we don't really have much choice now other than to go nuclear. Like the best documentaries, it is engaging, nuanced and avoids preaching its cause.</p> <p>\"Balance is everything,\" says my fellow juror Ray McCormack, the Irish director of award-winning documentary A Crude Awakening: the Oil Crash. \"It was far more effective getting someone from the industry spelling out the dangers of nuclear energy than someone from Greenpeace,\" he says. </p> <p>Other environmental films that have impressed McCormack include Workingman's Death, The Future of Food and The Animals Film, which showed on Channel 4's first night. \"I've been a vegetarian ever since.\" </p> <p>Every film-maker wants the viewer to care passionately about their issue by the time the credits roll. But, sadly, good environmental films rarely make the light of day. At best, they are destined for a late-night slot on BBC4 - and that's the successful ones. </p> <p>\"Every year I watch about 1,000 environmental shorts, animations and features from around the world before choosing the shortlist for my festival,\" says Hey-Rim Hwang, programmer for the Green film festival in Seoul and another fellow juror. \"I've seen them all - good, bad and ugly. Lots of western documentaries about the exploitation of natural resources in Africa, for example, are very one-dimensional. They don't address the colonialistic attitudes of the exploiters.\" Among the best she's seen are When Clouds Clear, about a community in Ecuador battling copper miners, and Encounters at the End of the World by Werner Herzog. \"Sadly, neither are that well-known to a wider public.\"</p> <p>Ask any cinema-goer to name their favourite environmental film, and you are unlikely to get much further than An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore's Oscar-winning, yet deeply dividing film about global warming. It did a wonderful job in popularising the topic - hence the Nobel prize - but it hasn't exactly led to a wave of environmental documentaries being signed up for distribution.</p> <p>Some of the films with the most effective green messages, however, have been big-budget movies. Children and adults have lapped up Hollywood animations such as Happy Feet, Finding Nemo and Wall-E, without necessarily noticing that they are watching a powerful condemnation of, say, the damage industrial-scale trawlers are doing to global fish stocks.</p> <p>Science fiction has also provided some strong environmental statements about where humanity might be headed if we don't address some of today's problems. I was transfixed by Logan's Run as a child, and the bleak vision it painted of a world nearly destroyed by overpopulation and pollution. (A more influential film from the same era is Soylent Green.) The Day After Tomorrow might have been an often laughable Hollywood take on the perils of global warming, but it brought the issue to a wider audience than any political speech. </p> <p>Hollywood has also successfully dramatised the real-life stories of those who have fought for environmental causes with films such as Erin Brockovich, The Emerald Forest, Born Free, Gorillas in the Mist and Silkwood.</p> <p>But for me, the most powerful environmental film ever is an often-forgotten 1982 release with a near-unpronouncable title. Koyaanisqatsi, directed by Godfrey Reggio, shot by Ron Fricke and scored by Philip Glass, is a haunting meditation on the fraught relationship between humanity, technology and the natural environment. It combines striking imagery with a mind-changing message. </p> <p>Any good environmental film, as we discussed in Turin, must boast such qualities if it is to truly influence its audience.</p>",
  "<p>The offers are tempting for any self-respecting green. For a small premium, or sometimes no premium at all, you can make sure that only clean, green, renewable electricity comes down the grid into your home. But what do you get for your money? Does the planet really benefit? Is this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/greenwash\">greenwash</a>?</p> <p>Most of us are not foolish enough to suppose that our electricity supplier specially packages up \"green energy\" for us, and shoves it down the wires. We just get regular electricity, of course. But most of us would suppose that if we pay a green tariff, someone somewhere generates more renewable energy \u2013 and burns less fossil fuel - than they would if we hadn't done our bit for the environment.</p> <p>But no. In fact, we are usually subsidising the power companies to do what they are required by law to do already. Worse, despite us paying through our green noses, they still can't meet their targets. Then they rub our noses in it by selling what \"green electricity\" they do produce over and over again. <br>This is all within the law, of course. But that is because the government's green laws are a mess. In many cases, buying green electricity is not so much greenwash as a full-scale green con.  Certainly, that's the view of Virginia Graham, who six years ago drew up the first set of guidelines on green tariffs, for the industry regulator Ofgem. She is now wiser and more cynical. \"It suits the companies for people to think they are getting green electricity if they sign up to green tariffs,\" she says. \"But in most cases they are not, and people are being misled.\"</p> <p>Let me explain how the system works. Under government rules, electricity suppliers have to make sure that a certain percentage of their electricity is generated from renewable sources, like wind turbines, solar panels and burning wood or plants. This is called the renewables obligation.</p> <p>The percentage rises each year. For the year ending March 2007, the most recent for which there are published stats on how the companies performed, the obligation was 6.7%. But the companies collectively only managed to generate 4.7% of their electricity from renewables. </p> <p>Most of the big companies missed the target by a country mile. EDF managed 5%, E.On 3.6% and British Gas 4%.<br> This may not all be the fault of the suppliers. It would take another article to explain what has gone wrong with rolling out British renewables. But the fact remains that the suppliers are selling green energy, often at premium prices, to green-minded customers as if this were on top of their existing commitments. </p> <p>Npower's juice tariff offers \"clean green energy at no extra cost to you or the planet\". The company says it gets sufficient power from offshore windfarms to supply its juice customers. Maybe so. But according to its fuel-mix declaration, only 3% of its overall supplies were renewable last year \u2013 less than half its obligation.</p> <p>To shed some light on this mess, Ofgem, the industry regulator, has been talking to suppliers for over a year now about setting up a mandatory system of labelling and an independent auditor for green tariffs. </p> <p>But insiders say the industry has been watering down the proposals, and no amount of fussing over the detail is going to get round the central point. Power companies that do not meet their legal renewables obligations are telling porkies if they suggest that when you sign up for their green tariff, they will deliver more green electricity. It just isn't so. </p> <p>To be fair, some tariffs do offer something a bit more certain. They promise to plant a tree for you, or put money into research into renewables. The EDF green tariff, which advertises that it \"lets you choose renewable energy for your home\", funds solar panels on school roofs and similar projects.</p> <p>But until they meet their existing renewable obligations, and demonstrate that people buying green tariffs will push them beyond the legal minimum, they won't get an extra penny out of me. </p> <p>The story doesn't end there, however. You see, green electricity is not just for greens. Not even mainly for greens. The biggest buyers are companies. When their electricity comes with a green label, they have taken to going around calling themselves \"carbon neutral\". Which is good PR. BT has made great play of having cut its carbon emissions by more than half by buying green electricity. </p> <p>So levy payers have been very willing to pay premium prices to buy \"green electricity\". So keen, in fact, that they buy more green electricity than is being generated in the first place. It is hard to believe that this is possible within the law, but I am told it is. An electricity supplier that has access to, say, two gigawatt (GW) hours of renewable electricity, can sell 4GW-hours labelled as renewable, says Graham. \"Renewable electricity is often being sold twice, perhaps more. Double counting is enormous.\"</p> <p>The government may be starting to get a handle on all this. In August, the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, announced plans for a crackdown on companies making dodgy claims about their carbon neutrality.</p> <p>At this point, you might shrug your shoulders and walk away from this green fantasy land. But not so fast. Because it turns out we have been paying for it all. All electricity customers, regardless of what tariff they are on, pay an average premium on their bills of \u00a310 a year specifically to help pay the electricity suppliers meet their renewable obligations. </p> <p>We know they don't fully meet those obligations. But surely every scrap of green energy that they do produce is ours, paid for with our \u00a310. But instead they are selling it to others, several times over. In the end, the biggest con seems have been perpetrated not on the buyers of green electricity, but on the rest of us.</p> <p>\u2022 How many more green scams, cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there?

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool's</a> coach, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, left the Vicente Calder\u00f3n last night insisting that his side had lost two points against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> rather than gained one. The Spaniard was also hoping that the 1-1 draw would not prove even more costly, after he took off three key players only four days before the crucial Premier League match against Chelsea this weekend.</p> <p>Robbie Keane, Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso all left the pitch in the space of 22 second-half minutes and Ben\u00edtez said afterwards that each had been taken off as a precaution. He also revealed that it was unlikely that one of the last night's absentees, the former Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker Fernando Torres, would be fit to face the league leaders at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.</p> <p>\"The international break is a problem and they were tired,\" Ben\u00edtez said. \"The pitch was very soft and they were struggling with muscle problems. A few of the players had problems and I made changes to try to keep fresh legs and to try to make sure players are fit. Gerrard is not injured, or at least not seriously. I hope he and the others will not be a doubt for Sunday but we will see.</p> <p>\"We will need to check on Keane tomorrow - it is his groin that is the problem. I think it is going to be very difficult for Torres to make it, though.\"</p> <p>Keane, Liverpool's first-half goalscorer, said: \"In the first half we had quite a few chances so we knew they would come out fighting and make it difficult for us. They put us under the cosh in the second half and then they had a few chances towards the end, so all in all you have to be happy with a point.\"</p> <p>Keane missed a good opportunity to double Liverpool's lead minutes after he opened the scoring but he attempted an elaborate flick from a close-range volley and missed. \"I should have had two,\" he said. \"It's no excuse but the ball was swerving all over the place. I should have got something on it but it wasn't to be.\"</p> <p>Simao Sabrosa scored an 83rd-minute equaliser as Atl\u00e9tico fought their way back into the game in the second half. And although Ben\u00edtez's side are still top of their Champions League group, on seven points with the home match between these two sides still to come in a fortnight's time, the Spanish manager remained disappointed.</p> <p>\"If you had said to me before the game, 'You'll have seven points,' I would have said yes please, but when you have been winning for 83 minutes and had the chances we had, only to lose it, you have to look at it as two points lost,\" Ben\u00edtez said. \"We played well, I thought we had a lot of control, but they reacted in the second half.</p> <p>\"We had plenty of chances in front of goal and round the edge of the box and it is a shame that we didn't take them. It might have been different if we had had Torres but we didn't have him so there is no point in talking about that.\"</p> <p>The match was marked by a series of controversial decisions. Keane scored from an offside position, but had another chance of a second ruled out when Yossi Benayoun was wrongly ruled offside. Atl\u00e9tico also had a goal ruled out and a one-on-one pulled back - and both times the linesman's flag went up wrongly.</p> <p>There was also a penalty claim from Albert Riera but Ben\u00edtez said that he had not seen the incident; similarly his counterpart, Javier Aguirre, would not be drawn on the referee.</p> <p>\"This gentleman next to me [the Atl\u00e9tico press officer] told me the decisions were wrong, as he always does,\" said the Mexican with a grin... \"but there's no point crying about it.\"</p> <p>Such controversy, however, could not sour the atmosphere on a night when fears about crowd trouble proved unfounded. The absence of Torres wrested much of the magic from the match, as did the cold wind that whipped through the arena, but the fans of both sides were still determined to enjoy the occasion together. When the two sides emerged from the tunnel Spanish flags filled the south stand, but red and yellow was also on display among the Liverpool fans. Drinks, songs and even sandwiches were shared in the north end of the stadium.</p> <p>Before the match, supporters from both clubs had met on the Toledo Bridge and made their way to the ground together. At Casa Angel, and down along Melancholic's Way on the walk to the stadium, fans joined forces in renditions of Y Viva Espa\u00f1a and, of course, gloried in the absent Torres, the man around whom this tie had been built, until his injury. Together they chanted his name, and that of Luis Garc\u00eda at the final whistle. When Gerrard was withdrawn, he was given a generous ovation by the home fans.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas is absolutely correct to say that the real failure on immigration is the government's record on clearing the backlog of asylum cases (We have lost people's trust on immigration, minister admits, October 21). It is extremely difficult for people to get into this country legally to work, or as a spouse or dependent. When people talk of an influx, what they are really referring to are illegal immigrants and those seeking asylum. It costs around \u00a340,000 a year to keep an adult in detention. It is in everyone's interests, including the applicant, to remove as soon as possible. Making the administration more efficient is the key. Again the minister is right, if the UK Borders Agency needs more money, people or other resources to speed up processing and removals, it must be provided with that. Introducing a cap on legal immigrants or other changes in legislation is unnecessary and will have no real impact.<br><strong>Keith Vaz MP</strong><br>Chairman, home affairs select committee</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008.

  "<p>Don't worry. You can be happy. All you have to do, according to government thinktank Foresight, is follow its five-a-day programme of social and personal activities, and mental health and wellbeing shall be yours. Just as you should aim for a quintet of fruit and vegetables daily, you should now be aiming every day to connect with others, take some exercise, learn something new, take notice of your surroundings and get involved with your neighbours and local community. Manage all this and you will emerge - or so the theory goes - with a psyche as sleek and healthy as your bowels.</p> <p>My own theory is that nothing is more likely to add to the sum of human misery than excessive interaction with others, enforced exercise and a daily stare round the bleak and desolate environs in which most of us live, but perhaps that just goes to show that I need to sign up to the government plan and sluice my psyche free of the cynicism, antipathy and scepticism currently gunging up its works. So for one day only, I gave it a shot:</p> <h2>1. Connecting with friends, family, colleagues and neighbours<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338908562\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/mangan460.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy Mangan chatting with Shirley Barry, a member of her local community.

I work from home, so have no colleagues immediately to hand. My sister lives in Bristol and hates me. I've been trying to connect with my father for 34 years and he's still not interested, while if I become any more closely connected to my mother there is every chance that we will become one indivisible being, to - I assure you - absolutely no one's mental benefit. </p> <p>I ring round my friends but they are all very thoughtlessly in full-time employment and quite firmly resistant to the idea of interrupting their working lives to improve mine. </p> <p>This is the trouble with Pollyanna-style advice, of course. It generally presupposes a level of disposable income and leisure time that most people find laughable. Still, God and thinktanks love a tryer, so I head out to see if I can find some neighbours.</p> <p>I find 72-year-old Shirley Barry sitting on a bench in the sun, reading a book and minding her own business. Odd as it feels, I approach her. Is she willing to chat to, if not strictly a neighbour, a fellow local inhabitant of Beckenham? She is. \"I wasn't expecting an encounter,\" she says. \"I've lived here for 35 years and the Beckenhamians don't normally speak unless introduced.\" I'm from Catford, originally, I explain. She moved here from Hampstead and we are soon deep in conversation about the strange north-south London divide. \"I think it's because they used to keep all the unpleasant industries below the river,\" she muses. \"Gluemaking, bonemashing - the great stinks. I think it's lingered in the consciousness. But,\" she grins, \"I'm Welsh. We'll talk to everyone in all directions.\"</p> <p>Talking to Shirley doesn't just make me feel good. She makes me feel there is hope for humanity. I might start disturbing people on benches on a regular basis. Score one to Foresight.</p> <h2>2. Learn something new </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338908978\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/23/Mangan3.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan happy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Learning to spatchcock a chicken.

Most of human unhappiness occurs during the school years when you are forced to learn new skills, facts and subjects all day with only occasional success. </p> <p>I could try, I suppose, at last to discover how to work out the area under a graph, if not precisely why, but Foresight suggests mending a bike, learning a musical instrument or trying new recipes. I have a bike but it is in full working order and it seems counterproductive to break it on purpose. I check the house for forgotten grand pianos and abandoned oboes, but find none. Cooking it is.</p> <p>Don't judge me, but I've always wanted to spatchcock a chicken. I print what seem like very clear instructions off the internet, but soon have to enlist the help of a husband.</p> <p>\"'Place chicken on a flat surface breast-side down.' Is the breast the top bit?\"</p> <p>\"Do you mean, when it's running about or when it's packed in its thingy?\" he says.</p> <p>\"When it's how you buy it from the supermarket.\"</p> <p>\"Because when it's running about, its breast is at the front.\"</p> <p>\"Yes. I understand that. Most breasts are at the front. It's almost the definition of the word. But is a supermarket chicken upside-down or back-to-front or what?\"</p> <p>\"Pull all its legs out from the body and we'll see how it must have walked when it was alive. Before it became this poor, plucked, pallid affront to humanity.\"</p> <p>\"OK. I still don't get it. Go and look on the internet.\"</p> <p>\"There's a video on YouTube. You're doing it all wrong. Turn it the other way. Cut down its backbone. No, its backbone. From its neck - no, its neck - to its bum.\"</p> <p>\"Now what?\"</p> <p>\"Now turn it over. And flatten it out.\"</p> <p>I have learned something new. I feel good. But bad for the chicken.</p> <h2>3. Be active</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338909136\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/23/Mangan2.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan happy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing tennis with her mother.

I loathe exercise more than I can possibly say, so the sheer pleasure I get from our game takes me entirely by surprise. Exercising outdoors is an entirely different experience from running on the treadmill at the gym or flinging yourself about in a fuggy hall as an aerobicised automaton shouts incomprehensible instructions. The air! The space! The freedom! I cannot lie. It really is uplifting. And it has the further inestimable benefit of allowing me to smash a ball at my mother's head and pretend it was an accident. Truly, a giant step to happiness.</p> <h2>4. Take notice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338909082\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/23/Mangan1.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan happy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kicking leaves in the park. Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"What is this life if, full of care,/We have no time to stand and stare?\" William Henry Davies, writer of these famous lines, was a one-legged vagabond, so if he could stand, stare and find beauty in the world, it behoves us all to have a go. </p> <p>Foresight recommends noting the beauty of the quotidian as well as the exotic and savouring the present, so on the way to the tennis courts in the local park, I try to discern the artless beauty in the skipful of rubbish outside an abandoned shop, the bell-like clarity of the children's voices in the school playground (which survives, by the way, even when they are shouting \"Throw the ball, dickhead!\" at a tiny, hapless figure clearly destined for a lifetime of panic attacks and bad life choices) and, in keeping with seasonal tradition, kick a pile of bronzed leaves in the park. A host of ageing dog turds underneath adhere firmly to my foot for the rest of the way. </p> <p>In the park, things become easier. Even in the middle of the urban sprawl, even in the middle of this unspeakably rotten modern age, find a few trees together with a stretch of grass and suddenly, despite all mankind's best efforts, you have beauty. And, just as we are about to leave, we see a flock of the parakeets that have inexplicably established themselves over the last few years in this corner of said urban sprawl settle in the largest oak tree - the quotidian and exotic in one charming prospect. </p> <p>And because I am savouring the present, I do not think about how they are driving out native species and how soon we will have to begin a serious programme of culling the lime-green interlopers. Nor do I dwell on the fact that this portion of Foresight's advice seems to amount to \"Be happy - stop thinking.\" They would be very proud of me, and my shit-covered shoes.</p> <h2>5. Helping friends and strangers</h2> <p>I can't find any strangers to help. The only ones I see are walking musclebound dogs that they are clearly itching to set on people. I go back to see if Shirley needs her shopping carried or something, but she is gone. I hit the phone again.</p> <p>Eventually, I get through to a friend who is in need of comfort. She is sitting in a Herfortshire A&amp;E with her toddler son who greeted the new dawn by climbing out of his cot and bouncing off the radiator below. \"He looked like he's been stabbed in the head,\" she wails. \"There was blood everywhere!\"</p> <p>\"But head wounds always bleed a lot, don't they?\" I say. \"Unless you can see brain, he'll probably be all right. And there are all sorts of carpet cleaners available nowadays. The room will be as good as new if you get scrubbing as soon as you're home.\" It feels good to help.</p> <p>So how do I feel at the end of the day? I feel better. If I - and almost more importantly, all my friends and family - could find the time and inclination to do it all every day I'm sure I would feel better still. But it remains for all but a fortunate few - whom I suspect are quite happy enough already - essentially unworkable advice. You might as well instruct the nation to live in the 1950s: surely the last time there was any hope of living this way en masse. As long as you were north of the river, of course.</p>",
  "<p>Of all the feats of misdirection that have characterised the financial crisis the stealthy but sure attempt to make footballers its poster boys seems the most pathetic. Have you noticed it? You would call it a whispering campaign, were it not for culture secretary Andy Burnham quacking loudly about football having to \"reassess its relationship with money\". </p> <p>You would call it a whispering campaign, were it not for the Daily Mail running endless paparazzi pictures of Steven Gerrard's wife in a new BMW. \"What credit crunch?\" the headline demanded tartly, while the copy was full of mawkish asides about the rest of Britain \"counting the pennies\" while Alex Curran \"indulged in a spot of retail therapy\".</p> <p>You would call it a whispering campaign, were it not for the apparent consensus that Ashley Cole was deafeningly booed less for his howler which presented Kazakhstan with a goal at Wembley the other week and more because he is seen as typifying the venal culture that now sits at odds with the straitened circumstances in which we find ourselves. </p> <p>Wondering why, on the day Alistair Darling had spent \u00a3500bn of taxpayers' money bailing out the banks, the Sun had splashed on that Afghan woman living in a big house on benefits, my colleague Peter Wilby noted that the Marxist answer would be that \"the corporate-owned press and its lick-spittle journalists are trying to direct the workers' anger away from the bourgeoisie towards members of their own class.\" \"The depressing truth,\" he countered, \"is that newspapers are giving readers what they want.\" </p> <p>With very little trouble we can extend this assessment to people's apparent desire to see high-salaried footballers taken down a peg, instead of focusing their anger on the real culprits. You hear a lot about things being \"put into perspective\" these days. One of the things that ought to have been put into perspective by the economic fiasco is just how responsible footballers really are for all the problems in society. Is it OK to place them way, way behind bankers right now?</p> <p>Footballers are the most minor villains, if they have to be villains at all. Obviously none of us could warm to Cole's emetic little memoir My Defence, whose most memorable passage involved him nearly swerving off the road in some flounce about \u00a35,000 extra a week. But conflating this with the financial meltdown is witless. Similarly does the Liverpool captain buying a new car count as rewarding failure in any serious way?</p> <p>As for Andy Burnham, it is worth reminding ourselves that Andy comes to the DCMS brief after a spell as chief secretary to the treasury, a position to which he was appointed despite having no meaningful background in finance or economics. One particularly clueless interview during the run on Northern Rock saw him labelled as completely out of his depth. He is clearly more comfortable in the relative shallows of scoring cheap points about football's relationship with money. \"The game is becoming increasingly polarised,\" Andy observed last week. \"The top clubs who build on global success are in danger of becoming detached from the communities that build them\" - much as the bankers were. Has that all changed, now we plebs own them? Not so much, it seems. </p> <p>And yet, this crisis feels slightly bigger than giving a toss about what Alex Curran is driving. Cannot the Mail stick a load of snappers outside the Lloyds chief executive's house(s)? You know the guy: he announced this week that staff would be getting bonuses whatever the government said. Let us see pictures of Lloyds board members out in their new BMWs. No doubt they would protest they are not public figures - and I would agree. They are a step beyond that - they are nationalised figures and, until they find a Sepp Blatter to gibber about their being treated like slaves, they should be required to pony up the entertainment we all need in these gloomy times. </p> <p>I propose the following, which would serve the joint purpose of administering some stick, after all those carrots, and addressing the black hole in Wembley's finances. Once a month, until they have paid back what they owe, XI bank directors should play XI bank directors at Wembley. Then instead of having to wait for Ashley Cole to make some mistake, the crowd would feel licensed from the get-go to come up with all manner of imaginative insults to rain down upon the players. It would be a shame that only one side could lose, of course, but it might remind us all that footballers are not public enemy No1.</p>",
  "<p>There is a sign as you enter this exhibition, relating to Andre Stitt's 30-year career as a performance artist, advising parental consideration of whether the material is suitable for children. It is ticklish to think that any parent might pop in, have a look at the often X-rated ephemera, and think, oh yes, let the kids in. This is the assembled background to a performance artist whose work can be messy, filthy and upsetting, and the collected items have a considerable menace of their own.</p> <p>What works best are the displays of things used in Stitt's performances. This creepy assembly of items gives you a good idea of the intensity of his work. Everything is tainted, besmirched, soiled with blood and sweat, and there's a gleeful juxtaposition for maximum effect. An \"I love New York\" T-shirt, horribly stained, sits next to a strap-on penis that's clearly been used; a baby's bib shares space with sadomasochistic headwear. There is humour here, as there often is in the performances, in the form of plastic false teeth sitting in a dog bowl that says UVF.</p> <p>Beyond these are Stitt's drawings and plans for his live performances, and these also bristle with worrying details. The directions say things such as \"washing dick etc.\", \"fuck tits! chicken feet\", and \"cheap wine-spew-piss\".

  "<p>Orpha Phelan's new Opera North production of I Capuleti e i Montecchi relocates Bellini's take on Romeo and Juliet to an unspecified urban war zone in the late 20th century. The results are both potentially controversial and less than ideally successful, though Phelan is right to emphasise an aspect of the opera that most directors ignore.</p> <p>Discussions of I Capuleti usually focus on its relationship to Shakespeare and the fact that it reworks Romeo and Juliet's sources rather than the play itself. We are incessantly reminded that there is no balcony scene, that Bellini's Lorenzo is a doctor not a priest, and that Tybalt and Paris are conflated into a single figure called Tebaldo. The greatest difference is frequently glossed over, however: where Shakespeare sets the drama against the backdrop of an internecine family feud, Bellini positions his lovers on opposite sides of a senseless, if engulfing civil war.</p> <p>Phelan is determined we should never forget this for a second, though she overstates her case somewhat. Bellini, a neoclassicist at heart, kept the violence off stage. Phelan relentlessly and noisily flings it in our faces. A gun-toting child executes a captured sniper. Romeo (Sarah Connolly) may be in love with Giulietta (Marie Arnet), but he's also more than willing to allow his followers to blast the Capuleti headquarters to bits, leaving Lorenzo (Henry Waddington) and Tebaldo (Edgaras Montvidas) to deal with the wounded. All this makes for angry, disturbing theatre, though it also reveals an unwillingness on Phelan's part to allow Bellini's music and dramaturgy to generate their own tensions.</p> <p>Bellini's primary interest lay, ultimately, in the exposure of the human psyche at moments of extreme crisis, and when Phelan dispenses with the on-stage arsenal and focuses on the opera's central confrontations, things become truly overwhelming. Connolly, Arnet and Montvidas are all at their absolute best in the work, singing with remarkable lustre and refined passion. The scenes between the lovers have a tender, concentrated stillness that separates their relationship from the violence around them. Connolly's climactic encounter with Montvidas - in which each acknowledges the other's grief and hurt - is breathtakingly done. It's conducted energetically and beautifully by Manilo Benzi, too. </p> <p>Not for the faint-hearted, but highly recommended, despite its flaws.</p>",
  "<p>The US election campaign, already breaking all records for fundraising and spending, is set to breach the $1bn (\u00a3614m) mark this month, making it the costliest by far in American history. </p> <p>The two candidates had raised a combined total of $961m by the end of September, according to figures released this week. But Barack Obama alone will almost certainly push that over the $1bn mark before the November 4 election. </p> <p>The total cost of the presidential race could be as much as $2.4bn, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based organisation that tracks political fundraising.</p> <p>The group has calculated that the US elections as a whole could cost $5.3bn when combining the candidates' fundraising with the cost of the congressional election campaign and contributions from unions and other outside organisations and groups. </p> <p>\"The election will blow through historic records on a number of counts,\" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the centre.</p> <p>In 2004 John Kerry and George Bush raised $880.5m in what was the most expensive election to date.</p> <p>Obama has so much money available that he is easily outspending John McCain in advertising, which is the biggest expenditure.</p> <p>Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which monitors spending on advertising, said Obama was close to saturation point. \"There is in essence no limit to what Obama can do. He has the lion's share of spending ... he has more money than TV space to buy,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Since September Obama has bought 330,000 adverts in all the battleground states compared with 100,000 by McCain, Tracey said. </p> <p>During his political career Obama has seen spending power as a key to victory. He raised a staggering $153m in September, bringing his fundraising total to $603m so far. Of this he has spent $470m. In September alone he spent $96.9m, of which $65m went on advertising, $5m on travel, $1.1m on polling, $1.8m on postage, $1m on setting up stages and $1.2m on credit card fees.</p> <p>He spent $3m on staff wages but this does not begin to reflect the size of his campaign, which has attracted a huge volunteer base. McCain, by contrast, is struggling to attract Republican volunteers and is offering $12 an hour for canvassers in Florida.</p> <p>While Obama is free to continue with fundraising efforts this month, McCain has been hobbled by having accepted public finance of $84m that prevents him from raising funds separately. </p> <p>Having spent $37m of that in September, he had only $47m - which in normal times would have been seen as a substantial sum - for the remainder of the campaign.</p> <p>Outside Obama's campaign team, his biggest backers are the trade unions, who are spending tens of millions on advertising and campaign staff. </p> <p>The United Steelworkers union, for instance, has 120 full-time staff working on campaigning for Obama, in addition to volunteers. </p> <p>Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the union, was yesterday unable to put an immediate figure on union spending but added: \"Democracy ain't cheap.\"</p> <p>The Obama team likes to portray its fundraising as a populist movement driven mainly by small donors, contributing $200 or less. </p> <p>But in an analysis of the 800-page file on fundraising and spending submitted by Obama under election law, the Washington Post found that only a quarter of the $600m raised so far had come from small donors.</p> <p>McCain potentially has access to the $80m-plus the Republican party has in the bank but some state party officials - either because of coolness towards McCain on ideological grounds or because they do not want to waste cash on what they see as a losing campaign - have withheld funds.</p> <h2>Election inflation</h2> <p>Amount raised by all candidates in previous elections</p> <p><strong>1976 </strong>(winner Jimmy Carter)$171m</p> <p><strong>1980 </strong>(Ronald Reagan)$161.9m</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> (Reagan)$202m</p> <p><strong>1988 (</strong>George Bush)$324.4m</p> <p><strong>1992</strong> (Bill Clinton)$331.1m</p> <p><strong>1996</strong> (Clinton)$425.7m</p> <p><strong>2000</strong> (George W Bush)$528.9m</p> <p><strong>2004</strong> (Bush)$880.5m</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr\">Queens Park Rangers</a> were last night set for a power struggle which could reshape the club after the vice-chairman, Amit Bhatia, went public with a promise to reduce ticket prices but in doing so appeared to undermine the authority of the chairman, Flavio Briatore.</p> <p>Supporters reacted with delight to an open letter from Bhatia - the son-in-law of and front man for Lakshmi Mittal, the world's fourth richest man, who took a 20% stake in the club at the end of last year - saying that the \u00a350 and \u00a340 category A and B tickets for matches at Loftus Road would be scrapped with immediate effect. Bhatia has styled himself as a populist with QPR fans.</p> <p>But Briatore, who with his fellow formula one magnate Bernie Ecclestone has control of QPR, is believed to be furious at Bhatia's declaration. He will seek urgent talks to clear the air and the collateral damage could include the sporting director, Gianni Paladini, who is Briatore's prime contact at the club. Paladini was fearful last night that he might lose his job.</p> <p>The manager, Iain Dowie, is already under pressure from Briatore, who is demanding that the club are promoted to the Premier League this season. There have also been suggestions that the Mittals might seek to buy out Briatore and assume full control of the club.</p> <p>Bhatia and Mittal have been infected by the football bug and they are also conscious of what Bhatia called the \"tough economic times\". \"Many of you [the fans] don't need the added burden of higher ticket prices at select fixtures,\" he said. \"Your despair was warranted and justified. So please be assured that with immediate effect and until the end of the season, we will have no category A or B fixtures and tickets for all home fixtures at Loftus Road will be category C. We stand corrected on the ticket price increases.\"</p>",
  "<p>The battle waged between George Osborne, Nat Rothschild and Peter Mandelson isn't just a political one. It is a PR showdown as well and involves some of the biggest beasts in the game.</p> <p>Nat Rothschild has Roland Rudd in his corner. The former financial journalist founded Finsbury PR in 1994 and helped build an entire sector of City PR advisers. He is employed by Atticus, the multi-billion dollar New York-based hedge fund in which Rothschild is a partner. Rudd also has longstanding links with the New Labour hierarchy and counts Peter Mandelson and Tessa Jowell among his close friends. </p> <p>His company, which was bought by Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP in 2001 in a deal estimated at \u00a360m, has grown into one of the largest City PR agencies with a string of high profile clients. </p> <p>Representing the Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska is Tim Allan, a former New Labour spin doctor who became head of corporate communications for BSkyB before founding his own PR company Portland. (Murdoch is also linked to the unfolding drama because three of the main players - Osborne, Mandelson and Rothschild - were present at his daughter Elisabeth's 40th birthday party in Corfu over the summer.)</p> <p>Portland took on Deripaska a few months ago, with a brief to represent the oligarch in his business dealings and over a high-profile legal challenge to his wealth. Its key job has been to ram home the message that he didn't initiate any discussions about making a donation to a UK political party and counter damaging allegations made by a former partner, Michael Cherney, who is suing him in the high court. </p> <p>Cherney is represented by Bell Pottinger, the PR firm founded by Lord Bell. Seen as the father of modern political communications, it was Bell who is credited with getting Margaret Thatcher's message to the masses during the 1980s and playing a key role in inflicting three successive election defeats on Labour.</p> <p>Cherney claims to have helped Deripaska take control of the Russian aluminium industry in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Deripaska's people accuse Bell of peddling untruths about him and are preparing to sue at least two of the Sunday newspapers that printed allegations about alleged underhand activity.</p>",
  "<p>It took only four minutes for the trickery and showboating to start as Barcelona romped to a 5-0 victory over the Swiss league champions, Basle, in Group C. The result gives Barcelona the maximum nine points from their first three group games, the only club to manage that and all but guaranteeing them passage into the knockout stages.</p> <p>\"There are no easy games,\" the Barcelona coach, Pep Guardiola, said, although observers of the wreckage made of the Basle defence might be inclined to disagree. \"Only when we give the maximum are victories like this possible.\"</p> <p>Daniel Alves produced a look-away assist, chipping over the Basle defence from the right as Lionel Messi dashed in at the far post. Barcelona employed the same tactic for their second, this time a chip from Xavi to the near post found Sergi Busquets with enough time to control and pick his spot past the Basle goalkeeper, Franco Costanzo.</p> <p>Bojan Krkic scored twice, first shooting between four defenders to beat Costanzo, the second coming almost immediately after half-time as Barcelona counter-attacked to devastating effect. By the time Xavi added a fifth, Basle were demoralised.</p> <p>The Brazilian Liedson shot low and hard in the 76th minute to give Sporting Lisbon a 1-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in Group C's other game.</p> <p>In Liverpool's Group D, PSV Eindhoven claimed their first points with a 2-0 win over Marseille, who have now lost each of their three games. The result leaves the Dutch side trailing Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.</p> <p>Danny Koevermans scored both goals, first heading home Stijn Wuytens' corner. For the second Edison Mendez, drawing the defence on the right, sent in a cross that bounced into the centre of the box, where it was met by the flying head of Koevermans, who angled it past the onrushing Steve Mandanda.</p> <p>In Chelsea's Group A Bordeaux secured a 1-0 victory against CFR Cluj that allowed the Blues to open a three-point gap at the top. Bordeaux benefited from a horrendous own-goal by the full-back Ricardo Cadu, who cut in front of his goalkeeper for an attempted clearance with his foot when the ball was nearer head height. Cadu, the captain, nearly had a second own-goal after an inadvertent back-heel required a sharp save from Eduard Stancioiu.</p> <p>In Group B Jose Mourinho's Inter beat Anorthosis Famagusta 1-0 with a goal from Adriano while Panathinaikos and Werder Bremen drew 2-2.</p>",

Errrr ... Brrrrrr ... Well, yes, as I said, the banking structure is a very delicate machine, and it needs something to oil it with, like milk.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> You oil the machinery with milk?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Yes, you know, you need something that you can pour into a cup and drink, or you can give it to somebody else to drink, or you can take it away and put two straws in it, you can share.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Yes. </p> <p><strong>JB </strong>And what happens, you see, is somebody suddenly says, out of the blue, I'm not going to take any of your milk because I might think it's off. And then I'm not going to get any of your milk, and then all the milk is standing around and gets rancid and hardens, and then when you get hard milk what do you get?</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Cheese.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>No, no, no, no. It's more like a jelly. </p> <p>It wobbles. And at this point the man in the street turns to his wife and says, 'Irene,' or whatever her name happens to be, 'we can't have that new house you wanted because all the milk has turned to jelly.' I hope that's clear.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Yes. But isn't the real cause of this crisis the fact that for years the banks have been lending huge amounts of money to people who can't possibly pay it back? </p> <p><strong>JB </strong>That's very, very simplistic. A banker can't possibly know the circumstances of each individual borrower. I mean, if somebody comes for a mortgage, unknown to the bank he might have his grandfather living with him. And again, unknown to the bank, his grand-father might be incontinent. And then the borrower has to spend large chunks of his income on new underpants, on colostomy bags, on recarpeting the lounge every few weeks. And you see we have to come up with systems and ways of allowing for that. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> And what systems have you come up with for that?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Well, our boffins have thought up some very complex financial instruments. Do you know what a collateralised debt obligation is?</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>(Pause.) Do you know what a structured investment vehicle is?</p> <p><strong>JF </strong>No. </p> <p><strong>JB </strong>That's a pity, neither do I. Well, we have these things, these CDOs and SIVs and we put all the dodgy mortgages and the incontinent grandfathers in them. And then, hey presto, the credit rating agencies call them triple A.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> And what does that mean?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>It means almost zero probability of loss.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> And what happens next?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>What happens next was that the word almost came to haunt us rather and, well, it was ghastly, because at four o'clock my CDOs were triple A, and at ten past four they were all junk and they'd gone into EOD.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> EOD?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Event Of Default. Which meant they were WBA.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> WBA?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Worth Bugger All. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> So what are you going to do about it?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Well, of course, the market and the City is very resilient, very innovative, very wise; it's always found the big idea.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> And what is the big idea?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>The big idea this time was to all go and have breakfast with Gordon Brown and then to completely ignore anything he asked us to do. But at least we got a free breakfast. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Yes, but I mean this is the worst crisis in finance that we've ever had. I mean a couple of weeks ago there was a rumour that the Halifax Bank of Scotland had run out of money.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>HBOS, yes.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> And that would bring the whole system down.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Yes, but that rumour was found to be false.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Really? Well I've heard a rumour that the rumour wasn't false, the rumour was true.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>What?! Where did you hear that?</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Well there you are, you see. Don't you realise the danger to the markets when they're affected by this kind of speculation. </p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Well, a very notable commentator on the markets has said recently that banks believe they would be less vulnerable to speculation if the Bank of England made good any holes in their finances. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> So what you're saying is you can ask for any amount of public funds at any time you want.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>No, that would be ridiculous. No, we asked for the Bank of England to swap their real money for the CDOs and the things which have all the incontinent grandfathers in it. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> So if you make profits you keep them, and if you make losses we pay for them.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>That sounds good to me, yes. (Applause.)</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> But you must realise that in turn for all this public money you're going to have to accept much tighter regulations.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Oh no, that's out of the question. That would fly in the fact of the principle of free markets, which has been the basis of New Labour's economic policy for the past 11 years. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> But you're going to have to change, you have no choice.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Well yes we do. People like me who earn millions of pounds a year, we can go abroad and work, we can go to the United States and work.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> But they have their own people ruining their financial system, They don't need any more.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Well all right, OK, if we are going to be regulated we'll do it under one condition.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> Which is what?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>That the people doing the regulation are the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> But they're the people who completely failed in the case of Northern Rock.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Exactly. And I am going to move my bank's headquarters to the Shetland Islands. </p> <p><strong>JF</strong> For what reason?</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Well, if the FSA weren't prepared to go to Newcastle to check on Northern Rock, they are certainly not going to go up there, are they? (Applause.)</p> <p><strong>JF</strong> George Parr, thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>JB </strong>Pleasure.</p> <p><strong>Bremner, Bird and Fortune: Silly Money starts on November 2 on Channel 4</strong></p>",

An alarm signal was transmitted to System 2 Security at 1.35am, but Avon and Somerset fire service was not called until 6.45am. The report says a vital five hours were lost. An investigation by the pier's owners, Kerry and Michelle Michael, and their insurance company is continuing into why a 999 call was not made following the initial alarm.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Tributes paid to family killed in motorway crash</h2> <p>Colleagues and neighbours of a family of six who died in a crash on the M6 in Cheshire paid tribute to them yesterday. David Statham, 38, his wife, Michelle, 33, and their children, Reece, 13, Jay, nine, Mason, one, and 10-week-old Elouise, were returning home to Llandudno, north Wales, when the accident happened on Monday. Neighbour Lyn Claricas, 70, described the family as \"lovely people.\" Judith Leslie, bursar at St David's College, where Statham worked as a chef, said he \"always had a friendly smile\". A 46-year-old Portuguese HGV driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.<br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>'No warning' before police shot De Menezes</h2> <p>A detective who held Jean Charles de Menezes down as he was shot by police yesterday told how his colleagues almost killed him. The surveillance officer, known as Ivor, told the inquest into the Brazilian's death that he feared De Menezes was about to explode a bomb. De Menezes was killed on the London underground on July 22, 2005, a day after suicide bombers struck. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Ivor said at one stage a gun appeared to be levelled at him. He did not hear any police officer shout a direct verbal warning or challenge at De Menezes before he was shot. The inquest continues.<br><strong>Vikram Dodd</strong></p> <h2>Teenager held over death of 16-year-old cadet</h2> <p>Merseyside police investigating the murder of the 16-year-old army cadet Joseph Lappin arrested a boy of the same age, from the Kirkdale area of Liverpool, yesterday on suspicion of the killing. Detectives had been looking for two boys thought to have been the ringleaders in the gang attack, which happened in Everton on Monday evening outside the Shrewsbury House youth club, which Lappin had just attended. Lappin suffered a single stab wound to the left side of his chest which pierced his heart. A second victim, aged 17, was stabbed and another suffered minor injuries in the attack.<br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>Witness protection urged in fighting 'honour' crime</h2> <p>Witness protection schemes should be extended to victims of \"honour\" crimes and their relatives, according to senior police officers. The first strategy for dealing with \"honour\"-based violence in England and Wales was published yesterday by the Association of Chief Police Officers following high-profile cases in which forces have failed to take allegations of violence seriously. Up to 12 people a year, mostly women, are murdered in the name of honour, according to Acpo. The strategy is intended to help rationalise different forces' approaches to such offences.<br><strong>Sandra Laville</strong></p> <h2>Tobago tourists sexually assaulted and robbed</h2> <p>Two British women were sexually assaulted and robbed on the Caribbean island of Tobago, officials said. A masked intruder carrying a knife broke into the Black Rock Dreams guesthouse, where the women were staying, an employee of the hotel told a local newspaper. He added that the incident had lasted up to an hour. A Foreign Office spokesman, urging caution for travellers, said: \"We are aware that an assault took place in Tobago and are offering consular assistance.\" The attack followed the deaths less than two weeks ago of a Swedish couple during a suspected robbery on the island.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Private companies to run new 'sin bins' for pupils</h2> <p>Ministers have given the go-ahead for private companies to run small schools for excluded children in ventures in which they will be allowed to make a profit. The schools secretary, Ed Balls, will today announce 12 pilot projects of replacements for pupil referral units after an admission that the so-called \"sin bins\" are failing thousands of children. They will be replaced by new dedicated units, some run by charities and others controlled by private providers. Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"This is the creeping privatisation of education.\"<br><strong>Polly Curtis</strong></p> <h2>A first for Swindon as speed cameras scrapped</h2> <p>Swindon council last night became the first town in the UK to scrap speed cameras over concerns that the government is using them to raise money. The nine-strong cabinet of the Tory-run council voted unanimously in favour of withdrawing from the partnership that operates local safety cameras; councillors objected to the government receiving proceeds from fines while the council paid for the upkeep of the cameras. Peter Greenhalgh, councillor for highways, said other speed-reducing measures were being considered, including education for motorists and reduced speed limits in problem areas.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>MPs demand rethink on aviation emissions</h2> <p>Fifty-four Labour MPs have signed a parliamentary amendment demanding the inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping in Britain's greenhouse gas targets. The number of signatories is enough to overturn Gordon Brown's majority when the climate change bill comes before the Commons next Tuesday and reflects backbench concern that the government's plans do not reflect the true scale of the UK's contribution to global warming. The target for 80% cuts by 2050 unveiled by climate change secretary Ed Miliband last week excluded international flights and shipping. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",

  "<p>Airport security found a bottle of saline in my luggage at Heathrow Airport last month. It was a 4oz bottle, slightly above the 100 ml limit. Airport security in the United States lets me through with it all the time, but UK security was stricter. The official confiscated it, because allowing it on the airplane with me would have been too dangerous. And to demonstrate how dangerous he really thought that bottle was, he blithely tossed it in a nearby bin of similar liquid bottles and sent me on my way.</p> <p>In a sense, this is a dumb game anyway; it's an overly specific reaction to tactics instead of threats. We take away guns and bombs, so the terrorists use box cutters. We confiscate box cutters and corkscrews, so they put explosives in their sneakers. We screen footwear, so they use liquids. We take away liquids, and they're going to do something else. </p> <p>So why are we even playing? We're playing because it's politically impossible not to defend against the particular tactic the terrorists tried last year. But because we know that liquids aren't really dangerous, we don't treat them as such - which makes confiscating them completely ineffective.</p> <p>There are two classes of contraband at airport security checkpoints: the class that will get you in trouble if you try to bring it on an airplane, and the class that will cheerily be taken away from you if you try to bring it on an airplane. </p> <p>This difference is important; making security screeners confiscate anything from that second class is a waste of time and doesn't make us any safer.</p> <p>Let me explain. If you're caught at airport security with a bomb or a gun, the screeners aren't just going to take them away from you. They're going to call the police and you're going to be stuck for a few hours in an isolated room answering a lot of awkward questions. You may be arrested, and you'll almost certainly miss your flight. At best, you're going to have a very unpleasant day.</p> <p>This is why articles about how screeners don't catch every gun and bomb that goes through the checkpoints - and their track record is actually pretty mediocre - don't bother me. Perfection is impossible, and trying would be too expensive. We can't keep weapons out of prisons, how can we possibly keep them out of airports?</p> <p>But the screeners don't have to be perfect; they just have to be good enough. No terrorist is going to base his plot on getting a gun through airport security if there's a decent chance of getting caught, because the consequences of getting caught are too severe.</p> <p>Contrast that with a terrorist plot that requires a 12-oz bottle of liquid. There's no evidence that the 2006 liquid bombers actually had a workable plot, but assume for the moment that they did. If some copycat terrorists try to bring their liquid bomb through airport security and the screeners catch them - like they caught me with my opaque bottle labelled as \"saline\" - the terrorists can simply try again. In fact, they can try again and again. They can keep trying until they succeed. Because there are no consequences to trying and failing, the screeners have to be 100% effective. Even if the screeners slip up only once every hundred times, the plot can succeed.</p> <p>The same is true for knitting needles, pocket knives, scissors, corkscrews, cigarette lighters, and whatever else the airport screeners are confiscating this week. If there's no consequence to getting caught with it, then confiscating it only hurts innocent people. At best, it just mildly annoys the terrorists.</p> <p>To fix this, those in charge of airport security need to make a choice: either a 4oz bottle of saline is a potential bomb, or it isn't. If it is dangerous, treat is as dangerous and treat anyone who tries to bring one on as potentially dangerous. If it's not dangerous, stop prohibiting it from being taken onto airplanes. </p> <p>Trying to have it both ways just distracts the security screeners from actually making us safer.</p> <p>\u2022 Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and author: <a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/blog\">schneier.com/blog</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Vista SP1 or not?</strong></p> <p>I'm being reminded every day to install the Vista Service Pack. What are the advantages, as I am quite happy with my system as it is?<br><strong>Barbara Fuller</strong></p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Vista's Service Pack 1 makes no visible difference to your system (or not one I noticed), and may not make any practical difference, though your PC should run slightly faster. The main problem SP1 dealt with was slow file copying. Otherwise, there are lots of minor tweaks that improve hardware and software compatibility, networking, and reliability. Many are for laptops - such as support for n-level Wi-Fi, faster resume from sleep, and better battery life - rather than desktops. Some changes have been made to make the core operating system the same as the one used for Windows Server 2008. Some have been made to satisfy the US Justice Department. Many of the changes will already have been made if you have Windows Update turned on, as you should. For a comprehensive list, see: Notable Changes in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (bit.ly/aj0051).</p> <p>In general, it's best to install Service Packs, because all new Vista PCs will ship with SP1, and all future enhancements and all new versions of software will be tested against SP1. Since there are well over 100m PCs running Vista, some people are bound to have problems. However, the risk is fairly low, and SP1 (KB936330) can be uninstalled if necessary: see <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948537\">support.microsoft.com/kb/948537</a>.</p> <p><strong>Vista SP1, no sound</strong></p> <p>I have a Dell Dimension C521 running Vista Home Premium. After installing Vista SP1, I cannot access any sounds.<br><strong>Colin Boatman</strong></p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> In some cases, for no logical reason, Vista Service Pack 1 appears to change the default setting for sound. Go to the Control Panel, run the Sound applet and check that first. Otherwise, Microsoft has a Knowledge Base article (<a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948481\">support.microsoft.com/kb/948481</a>).</p> <p><strong>Backchat</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Peter Medhurst wanted to keep using his ageing PowerMac G5, and I suggested installing Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5), possibly in parallel to his current OS.

Rhodri Jones says: \"I have the same model of G5 with 2GB of RAM. I upgraded to Leopard and noticed a very good increase in speed with the apps I use. No problem running Safari - or Firefox, my preferred browser.\" For other old Mac owners: Leopard does not support PowerPC G3 processors, or G4 processors with clock speeds below 867MHz.</p>",

In the first of this \"groundbreaking new series\", the star of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps spends four nights at the island's Dodds Prison: a monumentally depressing institution in which deprivation replaces rehabilitation, frustrated intellects fizz like fermenting apples, and the most popular pastime involves stuffing one's foreskin with melted balls of plastic. Here, Mellor drifts around like an apologetic, superfluous ghost; scratching, saying \"mm\", weeping confusedly, and responding to tales of relentless emotional barbarism with the ashen diffidence that is the default setting of the bewildered celebrity dilettante. Mm, indeed.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I love my partner wholeheartedly. He is beautiful physically and emotionally but I have a much lower sex drive than him. I force myself to have sex, just to keep him happy, because I am afraid he will leave me if I don't. I rarely enjoy it and most of the time I fake orgasms so that it will be over quicker - sometimes it's painful because I'm not aroused. We have been together for a few years now and I have felt like this almost from the start. I'm only 33. Is it possible that I have just lost my libido, and is there anything I can do to bring it back?</strong></p> <p>Firstly, never ever go through with having painful sex; that could lead to your developing a serious sexual disorder. Has sex been fulfilling with previous partners? If so, what is different now? Are you more stressed, fatigued, angry? Less healthy, or experiencing side effects from any medications? Check it out and, if so, make changes. You should be able to get more pleasure from sex - it's a mistake to think that men just want to have easy sex with a \"perfectly responsive\" partner. A man usually notices if you're not actually excited - and his penis doesn't feel good inside you if you're too dry. Most men really appreciate a woman who shows them how to arouse her but it seems that you are too reticient or nervous to do that. You deserve to enjoy sex. Your belief that he would leave you if you were candid about wanting more out of the experience is likely to be inaccurate. When a woman is truly turned on, a man knows and loves it.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Pamela Stephenson Connolly</strong> is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p> <p>\u2022 Private Lives appears every Thursday.

  "<p>I have a friend - let's call her Hannah - who is obsessed with <strong>Banged Up Abroad</strong> (Five). \"Because they're idiots,\" she says, about the unfortunate people who end up rotting away behind bars in these godforsaken foreign hellholes. She's seen a lot (all) of these shows and knows how they normally go. </p> <p>The hero, if you can call him that, is generally some poor fool who finds himself at a low point in life - low on money, low on self-esteem, very low on common sense. Quite often there's a pretty lady involved. Come on holiday, she'll say - to Thailand, Peru or wherever - even though I'm a nine and you're a two. Oh, and I know we haven't even spoken all holiday, but now we're going home, will you strap these massive blocks of drugs to your chest?</p> <p>It's not always quite like that. Sometimes it's just a couple who've run out of money and want to get home. But there's nearly always someone attractive and persuasive, and the common theme is extreme stupidity. Still, you end up feeling very sorry for them. And you feel their fear in the reconstructions, especially when they head through customs, sweating and bulging in all the wrong places. Even though you know what's about to happen, that part is very tense. And if you've ever taken anything through customs you shouldn't have done, even an extra carton of cigarettes, then that terror comes flooding back. I'm guessing here, obviously. As is Hannah. And then there's the excitement at the end, when the camera pans back and you find out if they made it out of hell, or if they're still there, rotting away.</p> <p>They must have run out of Brits, because Daniel, our hero in this episode, is American. He's still an idiot, though, and does absolutely everything to ensure there's exactly zero possibility of not getting caught. Every time an opportunity arises for him to do something that may lessen the chances, no thanks, he turns it down. He even snuffles up enormous quantities of cocaine just before attempting to check in at Quito airport, Ecuador, so he's in a proper Scarface state of mind when they ask to see his boarding card. \"Orders? You givin' me orders? Amigo, the only thing in this world that gives orders is balls. You got that? Balls ... \"</p> <p>Well, he might as well have said that, because he was basically behaving like Tony Montana. And guess what - they take him in. But Daniel's errors don't end there. He tells them he masterminded the whole operation so that Dutch (the attractive, persuasive one and the real mastermind) can go free while he goes down.</p> <p>So, pan-back time. Is he still there, rotting away in his own idiocy, or is he now a Baptist minister in Idaho? Somewhere between the two, in fact. It seems the Ecuadorians felt sorry for Daniel, too, because \"time\" ended up being only three and a half years. And there was so much cocaine in Quito jail, it probably felt like five minutes. Now Daniel's in rehab in California. That's about as happy as the endings get in Banged Up Abroad. </p> <p>\"You know what I can't wait for?\" says Hannah. What? \"Banged Up Abroad with that couple who got caught shagging on the beach in Dubai.\" She's classy like that. But you know what? I can't wait, either. Let's hope they do it. </p> <p><strong>Desperate Housewives</strong> (Channel 4) has moved on five years from the momentous events - shootings, beatings, etc - that ended series four. Gaby is all frumpy now, and has two fat kids. Where's the joy in that? Desperate Housewives was never about reflecting reality, was it? Actually, you know what, I think I've moved on, too. This is the beginning of series five, can you believe it? And where once it was fresh, kitsch and amusing, now it just feels a bit silly. The narration, too, by the dead lady, Mary Alice Young - that was also clever once; now it just annoys. I'm not getting involved in this one.</p> <p>But I do like Gaby's attempt at making her fattest kid less fat. She puts not-so-little Juanita out of the convertible Aston Martin and makes her run after it. My mum used to do that with our fat labrador. Well, not out of the Aston, because we didn't want Sesame's muddy paws messing up the leather seats, and also because we didn't have one, but out of the Mini Clubman. </p> <p>Anyway, it backfires - the plan, not the Aston Martin. Juanita may be fat, but she's not stupid. She gets on a bus. Sesame never did that.</p>",
  "<p>Thailand's new prime minister was forced to flee angry protesters for the second time in a fortnight yesterday when he was cornered in an underground car park.</p> <p>A crowd of about 200 jeering workers from the state telecoms operator screaming \"Somchai, murderer\" pelted Somchai Wongsawat with plastic bottles and shoes as he visited the information ministry in Bangkok. As the mob surged around him, Somchai slipped into the building and emerged through the front entrance, apparently in an effort to talk to the demonstrators. But the mob threw bottles and shoes at him. Hurling shoes is insulting in Thai culture as they are associated with what is considered the dirtiest part of the body.</p> <p>Violent anti-government protests have paralysed the capital for months.

  "<p>From the mid-1930s, the arrival in Britain of \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects fleeing Europe was to have a profound and lasting effect on the course of architecture and design. Some, such as Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger and Peter Moro, arrived fully trained. Others, such as Stefan Buz\u00e1s, who has died aged 93, belonged to a later generation who were trained here but demonstrated the value of a good, central European education. His solid grounding in cultural values, combined with a modernist aesthetic, produced highly original buildings that brought sophistication and elegance to functional forms, and in doing so helped to raise design standards across the UK.</p> <p>Stefan was born in Tapolca, Hungary. On his mother's side, the family were wine producers from the Lake Balaton area. His father, a lawyer and idealistic Jewish socialist, was involved in the 100-day communist government in Budapest in 1919 and, when the Horthy counter-putsch routed the communists, the Buz\u00e1s family were forced to flee to Vienna, where Stefan was educated. He studied at the Technische Hochschule faculty of architecture, perhaps influenced by his uncle, Mano Lessner, a talented architect. However, in the spring of 1938, as the political situation deteriorated, Stefan was sent to Britain. He never saw his parents again.</p> <p>He lived briefly at Lawn Road flats, Hampstead, north London, a famous example of early modernist architecture and a haven for many refugee intellectuals, and before long he entered the Architectural Association school, where he formed lasting friendships with Oliver Cox and Leonard Manasseh. Another early friendship was with Michael Ventris, who famously deciphered the Linear B script.</p> <p>He graduated in 1940, and soon after began what was to become a long and happy association teaching at the architecture department of Kingston School of Art, where he met, and subsequently worked with, Eric Brown on several interiors and exhibition stands. </p> <p>In 1942 Stefan married the opera singer Joan Mills, with whom he had two daughters. In 1948, with a group of contemporaries, including Fello Atkinson and Dick Maitland from the Architectural Association, he set up James Cubitt &amp; Partners. Among the practice's early works were two projects designed by Stefan which, in the grey days of the 1950s, made an impact out of all proportion to their size: the South African tourist office and Qantas Airways next door, both in Piccadilly. Their sophistication and elegance set a standard of design against which other work in this field would be judged. In an article by Atkinson for the Architectural Review entitled The Disappearing Shopfront, these were the key images, and a prescient indication of how the appearance of our high streets would be changing.</p> <p>In 1951 Stefan designed and built a pair of small houses on adjoining plots at Ham Common, Surrey, one for his family. These were widely considered to be exemplars of the purest modern domestic architecture. Although now altered, they were on the visiting list of the 20th Century Society. For the Festival of Britain in 1951, he designed a section on earth sciences in the Dome of Discovery, an oasis of order and clarity in the confusion of that interior. This was followed in 1952 by the design of the Weather Window for the Time Life building in Bond Street. Beautifully detailed, with graphically presented electronic forecasting, it neatly reflected the English obsession with that subject.</p> <p>As the practice grew, it produced a string of fine buildings, including many schools for Hertfordshire under the direction of CH Aslin, the county architect. As the Cubitt partnership expanded, particularly in Africa, with offices opening in Accra and Lagos as well as Singapore, its buildings, especially those designed by Stefan, encapsulated the best functional design aspects of the modern movement and helped establish the practice's reputation. Tropical architecture at that time was flowering, with lightweight structures, gridded facades with louvred screens and balconies added to the new vocabulary, producing an elegant and functionally efficient form.</p> <p>Working in these parts of the world had its drawbacks. Expensive offices had to be set up and the fees from foreign governments and their administrators were often delayed interminably. This resulted in severe strains on the practice which started to affect the partners, who began to work in some degree of isolation. In 1955 Stefan took a year's sabbatical in the US as visiting professor in the architecture department of the University of North Carolina, where he met and formed a close friendship with the architect/engineer Eduardo Catalano. </p> <p>Back in England, he resumed working for the Cubitt partnership and in 1965, the year he left the practice, it won a major commission for the Cummins engine factory in Darlington, County Durham, designed in association with Eero Saarinen. Three years prior to this he designed the interior of the new Manchester airport. This was followed by interiors for the Standard Bank premises in Northumberland Avenue, London, and that year he and I were included in a group of four British architects, each commissioned to design a room-setting for a typical modern house at the British Exhibition in Stockholm. The pair of us opened a joint office in 1965.</p> <p>We collaborated on various projects before he retired in 1992, including interior designs for the new London offices of the merchant bankers Schroder Wagg, and then Lazards, and a series of interiors for the QE2 liner. Latterly he designed treasuries at Chichester and Norwich cathedrals, which will remain as a memorial to a highly original and sensitive architect. </p> <p>Never personally ambitious, Stefan was, when occasion demanded, decisive and outspoken. His natural fluency in languages and a gift for friendship made him a much loved companion, here and abroad. He had a strong affinity for Italy, aided by his admiration for the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa, with whom he shared a love for Sir John Soane's Museum, for which he wrote a guide book. A lifelong socialist, he detested the Thatcherite credo and the destruction it wrought on so many of the qualities he admired most in his adopted country. He became my father-in-law when his daughter Kate and I were married in 1966.</p> <p>He was a fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1961.</p> <p>His marriage ended in divorce, and he is survived by his daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 Stefan Buz\u00e1s, architect and teacher, born January 16 1915; died October 2 2008</p>",

However, the regulator said magazine distribution could work better if there were greater competition among wholesalers.

Others facing redundancy include those in advertising sales, finance, IT, conferences and marketing. No journalists will go, but FT insiders fear the loss of librarians will affect editorial quality. An FT spokeswoman said the cuts were part of the paper's streamlining and integration.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday October 24 2008</strong></p> <p>We were wrong to say in the article below that Nat Rothschild accused George Osborne of securing a \u00a350,000 donation. He accused him of soliciting a donation. Osborne denies the charge. This has been corrected.</p> <p> </p> <p>Nat Rothschild, the merchant banker who accused shadow chancellor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> of soliciting a \u00a350,000 donation from Russian oligarch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, has warned he will destroy Osborne if the Tories continue to question his account of the discussions that took place at his villa on Corfu. </p> <p>Declaring a form of uneasy truce, friends of Rothschild said he did not at this stage want to escalate the public battle with his old friend. They said Rothschild had not intended to bring Osborne down by disclosing the shadow chancellor's involvement in talks about raising money from Deripaska. Instead, the friends said, Rothschild had intended it as a \"slap on the wrist\" because he was furious that Osborne had breached confidences in an attempt to damage Labour business secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mandelson\">Lord Mandelson</a>.</p> <p>The friends added that given his deep social connections with the Conservative party, Rothschild did not want the battle to deteriorate or lead to a mutually destructive court case. </p> <p>But a source close to Rothschild said: \"If anything is put out that in any way contradicts what he has said, Nat will come back.\" Rothschild has insisted that Osborne did solicit funds, contradicting the shadow chancellor's account.</p> <p>The source added that Rothschild had written witness statements from two friends, including James Goodwin, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.</p> <p>\"This is not a white flag of surrender. He dropped his bombshell because he was angry. This is not a campaign to get George,\" the source said. </p> <p>The revelation came as Gordon Brown tried to intensify the pressure on the Conservatives by calling during prime minister's questions for an official investigation into the allegation that Osborne had conspired to break the law by trying to channel a donation from Deripaska through a British-based company he owns. </p> <p>It also emerged that David Cameron and Osborne were warned earlier this month that Mandelson knew the shadow chancellor had discussed a donation from the Russian billionaire during the Corfu holiday, Conservative sources confirmed last night. Conservatives said a warning was issued to Cameron's office after Osborne leaked details of his discussions in Corfu with Mandelson to the Sunday Times.</p> <p>Mandelson and Rothschild were enraged on October 5, two days after the former European trade commissioner was reappointed to the cabinet, when the Sunday Times reported that he had \"dripped pure poison\" into the ears of an unnamed Tory on holiday. This was sourced to Osborne, an old friend and Oxford contemporary of Rothschild.</p> <p>Mandelson brushed off Osborne's indiscretion at the time with a light-hearted warning to the shadow chancellor that he might be tempted to reveal his unflattering thoughts about the refusal of many Tories to come to terms with the modernisation of their party.</p> <p>But a stronger private message was later delivered to Ed Llewellyn, Cameron's chief of staff who is also close to Osborne. Llewellyn was told that the shadow chancellor needed to \"be careful\" because Mandelson knew about the donation discussion, according to Tories. Llewellyn was told that Mandelson had something \"explosive\" about Osborne. Tory sources confirmed that Llewellyn was told by friends of the business secretary that both sides had an interest in acting discreetly.</p> <p>The message led some Tories to conclude that Mandelson must have persuaded Rothschild to reveal Osborne's efforts to secure a donation. But Mandelson was only given a few hours' notice of Rothschild's almost impetuous plans to go public this week, and there is no suggestion that Mandelson tried to persuade Rothschild to exact revenge on Osborne. </p> <p>The disclosure came as Deripaska also decided to lower the temperature. His spokesman said the Russian oligarch had no intention of saying anything further about the controversy and only wanted to make clear that he had not initiated the discussions of a potential donation. </p> <p>Friends of Rothschild believe Osborne has recognised he was wrong to breach confidences and that his reputation for sound judgment has been damaged. </p> <p>But Labour was still trying to stoke the row. Brown surprised many on his own side when he told MPs the issue \"is a very serious matter indeed, and I hope that it is investigated by the authorities\".</p> <p>In the immediate wake of his remarks, the prime minister's spokesman did not provide a clear sense of the alleged offence or which authorities should investigate claims that Osborne, and the Tory chief executive, Andrew Feldman, may have conspired to break the law. </p> <p>But Denis MacShane, the former Foreign Office minister acting with the support of Downing Street, claimed the law could have been broken even though no donation was received. He said: \"The law is clear - you don't have to directly solicit or receive a donation from an impermissible donor to break the rules.\" </p> <p>MacShane said Osborne had admitted that he held discussions with Feldman and Rothschild on whether Deripaska could give \u00a350,000 via Leyalnd Daf, a Midlands based vehicle firm that the Russian owns. MacShane said: \"If any such discussion did take place involving Mr Osborne, he may have broken the law.\" Neither the parliamentary commissioner for standards nor the Electoral Commission have received a formal complaint.</p>",
  "<p>Navel-gazing commentators in American journalism schools love to lament the dumbing-down of US political culture, but recently they've had no cause for complaint: the focus of debate has been the very nature of reality itself. At a campaign stop last week, Sarah Palin congratulated her audience for living in \"the real America\", and spoke of her love for \"the pro-American areas\" of America, a truly mindbending concept that may cause injury if you reflect on it for too long. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as John McCain watches the once solidly Republican state of Virginia slip out of his grasp, the latest campaign talking-point is that northern Virginia - the Washington suburbs where the Democratic vote is strongest - isn't \"real Virginia\" at all. Naturally, such distinctions enrage liberals, who resent the idea that not voting Republican equals a lack of patriotism. But the McCain/Palin definition of \"reality\" caught up with a prominent Republican too this week when Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior McCain adviser, told a TV interviewer that she herself, Pfotenhauer, lived in a part of Virginia that she didn't consider to be real, whereupon she immediately vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving only an empty studio chair and the faint aroma of absurdity.</p> <p>Perhaps she's gone to \"the celebrity land\", another mystical world invoked by Palin this week. \"We were on the bus today, we were making a list of who are some celebrity singers who could come out and help us, and gosh, for the life of us, the pickins were slim there!\" the Alaska governor told a crowd. \"Who's quasi-conservative out there in the celebrity land?\" The correct answer to this question is \"the actor Robert Duvall and that guy from Metallica\". But that's hardly the point: Palin's apparent ability to perceive all these multiple dimensions raises the serious possibility that she is operating from a plane of intelligence so elevated, so completely inaccessible to all but a few of the world's leading superstring theorists, that it wrongly appears to the rest of us very much like immense stupidity.</p> <p>Contrast Palin's fondness for \"the real America\" with the disdain for reality demonstrated by the anonymous George Bush aide who famously described the president's critics as belonging to \"the reality-based community\". (\"We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality,\" the source told the journalist Ron Suskind in a now legendary 2004 New York Times article.) Which is more worrying: that the Bush White House believed reality could be ignored, or that Palin thinks her opponents aren't real? Actually, don't answer that.</p> <p><strong>Making sure people show up at the polls on election day </strong>is crucially important work, of course, and one hesitates to mock any well-meaning effort to get out the vote. But can we make an exception for Ben &amp; Jerry's, the ice-cream company whose ostentatious stance of corporate community-mindedness as a marketing tool is almost as annoying as the cutesy names of their flavours? Fresh from getting free publicity from Cherries for Change, their pro-Obama repackaging of Cherry Garcia, the firm has launched a voter-reward campaign offering a free scoop of ice-cream for anyone who can prove they voted on November 4. \"Show us your 'I Voted' sticker, a photo of you in front of your polling station, do the I Voted Dance, or just tell us you voted!\" the company's website proclaims excitedly. Which would be a marvellous democracy-enhancing wheeze were it not for the fact that offering any kind of recompense for a vote where federal candidates are on the ballot is an offence under US law. \"If I were Ben &amp; Jerry's lawyer, I'd tell them to shut this down,\" writes Rick Hasen, an expert on voting legislation at Loyola law school in Los Angeles, and also, it would appear, a crotchety spoilsport who probably just needs a few more scoops of New York Super Fudge Chunk and a big hug.</p> <p><strong>Another voter-reward scheme that may be in breach of </strong>the law: John McCain's daughter, Meghan, has told New Hampshire voters that if her father wins there she'll have the state motto, Live Free or Die, tattooed on to her body. Not many things are to John McCain's credit at the moment, but one of them is the fact that he's letting his daughter join him on the campaign trail without dictating what she says to the press - a far cry from Chelsea Clinton's message-repeating appearances, let alone Mitt Romney's five sons, who during the primaries ran a strictly on-message and vaguely terrifying weblog, the Five Brothers Blog, in support of their disconcerting father. Meghan McCain, who runs an entirely amiable website at McCainBlogette.com, has called Barack Obama \"cute\", reported drunken evenings in karaoke bars on the trail, offered candid thoughts on her father's campaign strategies (Mike Huckabee as vice-president, she noted months ago, was \"not gonna happen\"), and spoken of the perils of dating a supporter of eccentric libertarian superhero Ron Paul: \"He collected Barbie dolls. I called my girlfriends after and was like, 'That's weird, right?'\" </p> <p>Turns out that there is a straight-talkin', likable maverick named McCain after all. What a pity they nominated that short-tempered, impetuous, negative-campaigning demagogue instead!</p> <p><strong>This week Oliver watched</strong> Sarah Palin's appearance on Saturday Night Live: \"She said almost nothing, so it was a triumph.\" <strong>He also spent</strong> far too long reading rightwing American blogs: \"You wouldn't believe the things I've heard about Michelle Obama. Which is just as well, because most of them are completely made up.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Which side is he on?\" Gordon Brown taunted David Cameron in another effective performance on the financial crisis at prime minister's questions yesterday. The same question, though, must now be asked directly of Mr Brown as the battle between liberty and the power of the state prepares to take another major turning. This new battle is summed up in two recent speeches. The first was delivered last week by the home secretary Jacqui Smith, who outlined plans for a potentially vast new state database that will contain details of every phone call, text message and internet visit made by every person in this country for all time. The new database, said Ms Smith, would be an essential part of the government's revised anti-terrorist strategy. Communications data of this kind is the lifeblood of 95% of serious crime prosecutions and of almost all security service operations in recent years, she said, but it must now be carried further to allow government to store the details of internet communications, including social networking sites.</p> <p>The second speech was given on Monday by the outgoing director of public prosecutions. Sir Ken Macdonald used his final public lecture as DPP to call for a level-headed and restrained approach to the insatiable demands of the security state in dangerous times. Without it, argued Sir Ken, parliament may shortly confer enormous and irreversible powers on the state to collect and hold knowledge and information about what every citizen is doing almost every second of every day - forever. Powers of this kind would break freedom's back, he warned. We must take immense care to understand what state we may be creating before we do so. Without restraint and proportion, the DPP cautioned, the result could be unbearable. </p> <p>These two speeches reflect an unresolved argument in Whitehall. The home secretary, whose department has been reorganised with security concerns at its centre (and thus with more security personnel drafted into it), speaks for those who believe the strengthening of the state to protect the citizen is the priority. The DPP speaks for those who think that precious rights and freedoms should not be trashed if terror is to be driven back and society to be made more cohesive. As individuals, it must be acknowledged, each of them recognises that there is strength in parts of the other's case. Both speak of the importance of balance and proportionality. Ms Smith insists that the database will not contain details of communications and that there will be no trawling through it by local authorities. She has deferred a communications bill to allow more public debate and has promised that any changes will require legislation. Sir Ken, meanwhile, recognises the risks from terror, accepts the need for intelligence and even military anti-terror operations, and is proud of his \"relentless prosecutorial struggle against terrorism\" that has resulted in a conviction rate in excess of 90%.</p> <p>In the end, though, these two officials are ranged on opposite sides of a fundamental argument. If you believe it is reasonable for the state to maintain a permanent database, holding details about everyone's communications; if you believe that the state has a good record of safeguarding individual databases on benefits, health and the military; and if you are confident that Britain's anti-terrorist laws will never be used for other purposes, then you will support Ms Smith's planned bill. If, on the other hand, you agree with articles four, eight and nine of the European convention on human rights, or with the US fourth amendment, or even if you simply think that Britain's creeping surveillance society has got to be reined in before it is too late, then you will respond to Sir Ken's warning and insist that, as with 42-day detention without trial, this new degradation of our freedoms is one that parliament must never allow to pass. As the prime minister so succinctly put it: which side are you on?</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin's elevation to become John McCain's nominee for vice-president serves as a reminder that what Americans call their \"culture wars\" are rarely as fierce in old Europe. It is hard to imagine a British candidate promoting the virtues of shotgun teenage marriage. Not lately, anyway.</p> <p>But in an understated British way, sincere feelings can still run high. They did on both sides yesterday as MPs voted not to discuss pro-abortion amendments during the remaining Commons stages of the human embryology and fertilisation bill. Vocally pro-choice MPs were furious that Harriet Harman - of all people - should be the leader of the Commons to engineer the sidestepping vote. Equally ardent pro-life MPs, as opponents of legal abortion call themselves, were quietly relieved. When they used the bill to try to reduce the legal limit on abortion (currently 24 weeks) they were defeated in the Commons in May. </p> <p>They feared that, if allowed, the rival camp's attempts to liberalise the law might have prevailed.</p> <p>Of course, the bill is not about abortion, but about expanding the remit of embryology research. It is a subject dear to voters whose families are blighted by genetic disease, but also allows abortion zealots to resume their 40-year battle over the 1967 Abortion Act by tabling rival amendments.</p> <p>The bill originated in the Lords, an important point because it means the Parliament Acts could not be used to force it through in a stalemate with the upper house. But is there any risk of that happening? Ministers argue that, if pro-choice MPs vote to relax the law, anti-choice peers may do the opposite.</p> <p>That seems unlikely. The bill was improved in the Lords, but peers avoided the abortion sub-plot and there were large pro-science majorities. The Blair-reformed Lords is more liberal than it used to be. </p> <p>Politics always divide between what the Greens call \"fundies\" and \"realos\", MPs who despise compromise and those who don't.

  "<p>Gareth Hock has been given the nod for one of the few contentious positions in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandrugbyleagueteam\">England's</a> team for the opening game of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleagueworldcup2008\">World Cup</a> against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/papuanewguinearugbyleagueteam\">Papua New Guinea</a> on Saturday after convincing the coach, Tony Smith, that his wild days are behind him.</p> <p>Smith omitted the fiery Wigan second-row from the Great Britain side he selected for last autumn's home series win against New Zealand after a season in which he had struggled for form, fitness and discipline on and off the field.</p> <p>The 25-year-old has had his problems this year, too, notably a dismissal for manhandling the referee Ian Smith during a miserable Wigan defeat by Huddersfield in July, for which many thought him lucky to escape with a five-match suspension and a \u00a3500 fine.</p> <p>But he returned in time to help Wigan beat Bradford and Catalans in the Super League play-offs, earning a place in England's 24-man World Cup squad, and his performances and attitude in the</p> <p>warm-up win against Wales in Doncaster and during training on the Gold Coast over the past week have cemented a position alongside Leeds's Gareth Ellis in the second row.</p> <p>\"I admire the way Gareth has been prepared to make some sacrifices and adjustments to the way he's acted in the past,\" said Smith yesterday. \"He's big and physical and I think he'll really trouble the Kumuls, so I think he's a logical person to throw into the fray.\"</p> <p>Significantly Hock was also one of Great Britain's best players in the Gillette Tri-Nations series in Australia and New Zealand two years ago, showing the sort of pace and mobility that Smith believes are essential in the southern hemisphere, and like several other key members of the side he has experience of beating the green and golds in an historic victory against the previously peerless Australian Schoolboys in 2002 - when he was named man of the series.</p> <p>Papua's coach, Adrian Lam, the former Wigan and Sydney Roosters scrum-half, named his team yesterday, with three players from Super League given key roles: Salford's John Wilshere at full-back, Stanley Gene at loose forward and his Hull KR team-mate Makali Aizue at prop.</p> <p>\"They did us a nice favour having a game against the [Australian] prime minister's XIII a few weeks ago so we've done quite a bit of work on that,\" added Smith. \"They scored 30 points, showing what we already know, that they like to have the ball in their hands and are tough to control when they do.\"</p> <p>Smith will ask for permission to meet Shayne Hayne, the Australian who will referee the match, to discuss the differences in rule interpretation, particularly around the ruck, between the Super League and Australia's National Rugby League.</p> <p>England have already claimed one moral victory, however, because the Papuan witch doctor who was expected to meet them off the plane in Townsville did not turn up.</p>",
  "<p>The playwright and screenwriter Luther Davis, who has died aged 91, had his biggest success as the co-writer (with Charles Lederer) of the book of the Broadway musical Kismet (1953), the score of which was derived from the music of Alexander Borodin.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the exotic show was unjustly called \"a borrowed din\" by one smart-alec critic, it was a huge hit for which Davis and Lederer won a Tony, as did the musical, which starred Alfred Drake and Doretta Morrow. Furthermore, Kismet was made into an MGM movie extravaganza, directed by Vincente Minnelli in 1955, starring Howard Keel and Ann Blyth. It was adapted for television in 1967 with Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and Anna Maria Alberghetti, and was transmogrified into Timbuktu, a 1978 Broadway musical, shifted from ancient Baghdad to Africa, with an all-black cast headed by Eartha Kitt; Davis produced it and wrote the book.</p> <p>He was born in Brooklyn, the son of Charles T Davis, a businessman and inventor whose surgical supply company developed improvements in sutures. In 1921, when Luther was four, his father was in his office when he was visited by two police officers and an insurance adjuster. Apparently believing them to be robbers, he shot them, killing a police officer and wounding the others. He was convicted of manslaughter and went to prison for some years. This incident may have influenced Davis's screenplay for Lady in a Cage (1964), which seems to imply that everybody is capable of violence. \"We built cities and towns and we thought we had beaten the jungle back ... not knowing we had built the jungle in,\" says Olivia de Havilland in the title role of a wealthy woman trapped in a lift and terrorised by the dregs of society.</p> <p>There was little in Davis's background to suggest a career in show business. He studied at Culver military academy in Indiana and then at Yale, graduating in 1938. During the second world war he served in intelligence in the US Army air corps in Asia and Europe, rising to the rank of major.</p> <p>In 1945, just demobbed, he turned the novel Shore Leave, by Frederic Wakeman, into a Broadway play entitled Kiss Them for Me, about three sailors on leave in San Francisco during the war. It featured Richard Widmark and Judy Holliday, prior to their film careers, and dealt with the stress of combat with wit and sensitivity. Davis sold the play to 20th Century Fox, but by the time it was screened in 1957 (with a script by Julius Epstein), directed by Stanley Donan and starring Cary Grant and Jayne Mansfield, it had lost much of its impact and was played mostly for laughs.</p> <p>Davis's first screenplay, again adapting a Wakeman novel, was The Hucksters (1947), a smart romantic comedy-drama with Clark Gable and Deborah Kerr (her first Hollywood role) which takes swipes at radio advertising. In a speech, fast-talking sales executive Gable says: \"I want to go on record as saying that I think radio has to turn over a new leaf. We've pushed and badgered the listeners, we've sung to them and screamed at them, we've insulted them, cheated them and angered them, turned their homes into a combination grocery store, crap game and midway [funfair]. Some day, 50 million people are going to just reach out and turn off their radios...\"</p> <p>Barbara Stanwyck was the eponymous BF's Daughter (1948), from the satirical John P Marquand novel on attitudes to wealth which Davis turned into a glossy \"women's picture\" for MGM, to whom he was under contract. The last of the three movies he wrote for MGM was The Black Hand (1950), a taut melodrama and one of the first American films about the mafia. However, it suffered somewhat from Gene Kelly's unconvincing portrayal of an Italian-American pursuing a vendetta against a man who killed his father. Davis returned to the mafia more successfully and more violently 22 years later in his final screenplay, Across 110th Street (1972), in which Anthony Quinn played an ageing cop.</p> <p>A Lion Is in the Streets (1953), directed by Raoul Walsh - the best director Davis had for his screenplays - was based on the life of Huey Long, but the filming was delayed to stave off a law suit by Long's estate. It turned out to be an ideal vehicle for James Cagney as the pugnacious populist 1930s Southern demagogue.</p> <p>However, Davis's most notorious film was Lady in a Cage, his only original screenplay, a notch above the many lurid shockers featuring ageing female stars made in the wake of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, two years previously. In it, he made both the victim and her tormentors equally unsympathetic. At one point, De Havilland turns on one of her persecutors (27-year-old James Caan, in his first film role) and declares: \"You're one of the many bits of offal produced by the welfare state. You're what so much of my tax dollars goes to the care and feeding of!\"</p> <p>Davis ended his career on a high in 1989 with his book for the Broadway musical Grand Hotel (music and lyrics by Robert Wright and George Forrest, the same pair that had helped to create Kismet). Given a lively production by Tommy Tune, it won five Tonys (Davis's book was nominated) and ran for more than 1,000 performances.</p> <p>Davis is survived by his wife, the actor Jennifer Bassey, whom he married in 2005 after living together for 27 years, and two daughters by his first wife.</p> <p>\u2022 Luther Berryhill Davis, playwright and screenwriter, born August 29 1916; died July 29 2008</p>",
  "<p>In uncertain times such as these, it ought to be reassuring to turn to British successes. The UK video games industry \u2013 or at least its development, as opposed to the publishing side \u2013 is a rare example of Britain punching above its weight. At least, that's the popular perception. Speak to any independent British games developer and you will find a considerably more apocalyptic prognosis. Recently, the situation has deteriorated so badly that a coalition of British development studios, backed by developers' trade body <a href=\"http://www.tiga.org/\">Tiga</a> and <a href=\"http://www.elspa.com/\">ELSPA</a>, the publishers' body, has embarked on a campaign to lobby the government, entitled \"Games Up?\".</p> <p>Games Up? seeks two things: tax breaks for UK developers in line with those enjoyed by the film industry, and institutional change in universities, designed to re-establish a flow of graduates with skills that are relevant to the game development process. But hang on: according to Games Up?, games made in the UK between 2006 and 2008 alone are on track to generate global revenues of \u00a34bn, and the global games market is worth \u00a318bn and growing at 9% per annum. The credit crunch isn't even an undue worry: consumers are known to turn to games in difficult times, as they offer protracted entertainment for a smallish outlay. So why are UK developers looking to the government for help?</p> <p><strong>Seductive benefits</strong></p> <p>The most pressing problem is that the UK development scene has slipped down the global pecking order since several other countries decided to seduce games companies with tax breaks. Ian Livingstone, creative director and head of acquisitions at Eidos, one of the few remaining British games publishers \u2013 and not a man ordinarily given to doom-mongering \u2013 explains: \"We've recently slipped from third to fourth in world development behind Canada. We're now the most expensive country in the world in which to develop. Other countries \u2013 not just Canada, but two states in the US, Scandinavian countries, France, Singapore, Korea and others \u2013 offer salary subsidies. Canada saw games as a clear opportunity to invest in the future, as traditional manufacturing was disappearing, and made a conscious decision to invest in games. They don't see it as a handout but as an investment. They have actually given out, in salary subsidies, 37.5% to every employee in games companies, and up to 40% R&amp;D tax-credit.</p> <p>\"Over 10 years, they have invested C$500m (\u00a3244m). But that has actually generated $1.5bn of inward investment from companies like EA, Ubisoft, and Eidos. It's paying off, because they have a great infrastructure there: they've got great universities providing skilled students, and they are generally pro-games. The difference between there and here is that our government clearly sees any state support as a handout, not an investment. It seems to me the UK government would rather see our great industry go into decline than help it maintain its prominent position in the world, and that is madness.\"</p> <p>Livingstone paints a bleak picture of the future of UK games development. \"In the past six years, half of the independent UK development studios have already closed or been bought by foreign publishers who see more value in our studios and intellectual property than we do ourselves. We'll end up being a work-for-hire nation. The inherent intellectual property that is created at those studios will be foreign-owned, and they can move that IP to be produced wherever they want in the world, if it suits them.\"</p> <p>Richard Wilson, chief executive of Tiga, is the spokesman for the Games Up? campaign. He has been meeting civil servants from the departments for Culture Media and Sport, Innovation, Universities and Skills, Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Children, Schools and Families and the Treasury, among others. He doesn't, however, sound enormously optimistic that the government will heed his call for \"20% production tax credit, like that approved by the EU and already found in France\". Not to mention that enjoyed for many years by the British film industry.</p> <p>He adds that \"the government understands that UK games developers are not competing on a level playing field\" but is \"reluctant to introduce tax breaks for games production unless it can be shown that there is an issue of market failure or that there are strong cultural reasons for supporting UK games developers\".</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the economic circumstances, the various government departments proved unreceptive to inquiries; the Department of Culture, Media and Sport was particularly dismissive. The Treasury did manage to produce a stultifyingly generic response although, promisingly, it says: \"Following approval of a cultural tax relief for games in France, the government is now working with the UK gaming industry to collect and review the evidence for introducing such a credit in the UK.\"</p> <p><strong>Battle for breaks</strong></p> <p>Don Foster, Liberal Democrat spokesman on culture and media, points out that the games industry is competing with others for tax breaks, notably fashion and tourism. He also believes the games industry suffers from an unjustifiably poor image: \"I hardly play any games \u2013 I'm not from that generation \u2013 but because of my job, I had to research the industry. The vast majority of my parliamentary colleagues are always wanting to ban the latest game, but they don't know the details of the industry. Few people in this country realise how important it is to the UK economy.\" Livingstone agrees: \"We're still seen as the red-headed stepchild of the creative industries, one notch up from pornography in the eyes of most of the establishment. They forget that half of the world and half of the UK's population play games. Games help define who we are as human beings \u2013 they are as important, culturally and socially, as music and films.\"</p> <p>There's another problem, though, which Foster highlights: a shortage of university graduates with the requisite skills. Which brings us to the second prong of the Games Up? campaign. There are 81 videogames courses on offer at UK universities, but only four are accredited by <a href=\"http://www.skillset.org/\">Skillset</a> and therefore taken seriously by the games industry. Livingstone says: \"These universities are churning out people who know a bit about games design and the history of games, but what we need are computer programmers, artists and animators: people with real skills who can start work tomorrow. It's better for us to go to somewhere like Imperial College and employ someone who has just done a computer science degree and knows how to program in C++.\"</p> <p>This problem ought to be easy to solve collectively, Livingstone says: \"The government, industry and education establishments have to come together to find a way to move forward.\" But Wilson says the government seems to have difficulty grasping the nature of the skills needed.</p> <p><strong>Bad law?</strong></p> <p>Jon Hare, director of development at Ukrainian developer Nikitova (and the co-founder of legendary UK developer Sensible Software) says that legislation of a decade ago which says developers must take contractors on as full-time staff after a year, or stop using them, has been economically damaging. Previously, such contractors would be paid a fixed amount for their work on the project, whether it overran or not, which allowed small developers to control their costs. Hare argues that tax breaks would merely offset extra costs which the government has introduced by that legislation.</p> <p>The Games Up? campaign may not be perfect, but, says Foster, it needs to make its case \"robustly\". But given how beleaguered the government is by the ongoing financial and banking crisis, Livingstone is pessimistic: \"The perception is 'why do we need it, as clearly we're doing well?' But do you put a new roof on your house when it's raining? Surely you should do it when it's sunny?\"</p>",
  "<p>Jake Tapper at ABC <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/tax-expert-pali.html\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>I just got off the phone with a well-respected and well-known tax attorney who doesn't want to be identified. I asked him earlier in the day whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin can avoid paying taxes on the $150,000 worth of clothes the RNC bought her, as she and the RNC maintain. (They said the RNC now owns the clothes; she's just borrowing them.) He said that after consulting with a number of experts as his prominent firm, he thinks the RNC and Gov. Palin are wrong. \"It's probably not a 'gift,'\" he said. \"The issue is whether it counts as 'income.'\" Palin's claim that the pricey duds belong to the RNC and she's just \"borrowing\" them and will return them later reminds him, he says, of some of the issues going on in the prosecution of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. (Some of the issues, he specified, not the allegations of criminality.) \"This is exactly the issue with the Stevens case,\" he said, \"When you loan something to someone can you call it a 'loan' if upon its return it has no practical value?\" \"The consensus view is she would have to count the wardrobe as income at least in the amount of the fair value of the rental of the wardrobe,\" he said. He added that the law is clear that uniforms -- \"big brown suits with your name on them\" -- don't qualify as income, but it would be hard to make the argument that fancy dress suits from Saks Fifth Avenue and Nieman Marcus are a uniform. \"Especially since Palin is employed by the state of Alaska and not the RNC,\" he said.</p> </blockquote> <p>No practical value depends, I suppose, on the eye of the beholder. The RNC says it \"always\" intended to give the duds to charity. Couldn't you just see a poor woman making $12,000 a year with no health insurance reveling in hand-me-down Valentino? As <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001054719\">Barbara Bush might say</a>, they're underprivileged anyway, so it might work out very well for them.<br></p>",
  "<p>Liberal journalists are combing the back roads of America looking for evidence of the resurgent racism being generated by the prospect of a black man becoming president. The striking thing is how little they've turned up in a country of 300m people with plenty of racial conflict in its history.</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jj1kZCWbZuJPjZJmiXBDDMgAOJcQD93SDSC84\">how the Associated Press led a roundup story</a> on Friday: \"Race, an inescapable but explosive issue on which both presidential candidates have tread carefully if not tried to ignore, is increasingly popping up as it's becoming more likely the country will elect its first black president.\"</p> <p>But since they couldn't find anything coming from John McCain, Sarah Palin or any of their staff or surrogates that would justify such a claim, the first evidence cited was that Democratic congressmen John Murtha and John Lewis had accused Barack Obama's opponents of racism.</p> <p>Eventually the AP story got around to citing the evidence of racism directed toward Obama that its vast nationwide reporting staff had turned up:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 In San Bernardino County, California, the October newsletter of the Chaffey Community Republican Women, Federated, showed Obama's face on a phoney $10 government food stamp coupon adorned with a watermelon, ribs and a bucket of fried chicken. Diane Fedele, president of the group, apologised and she had no racist intent: \"It was just food to me. It didn't mean anything else.\" The state GOP denounced the newsletter.</p> <p>\u2022 In Nevada, Colorado and Michigan, TV ads show a clip of [the Rev Jeremiah] Wright declaring \"God damn America!\" in a sermon. \"How can we forget these hateful sermons from Obama's pastor for over 20 years?\" says one ad by the Our Country Deserves Better PAC, a Sacramento, California-based group that was formed to campaign against Obama.</p> <p>\u2022 In Danville, Virginia, The Voice, a local newspaper, published a column by McCain's Buchanan County campaign chairman, Bobby May, that mocked an Obama administration. It said he would change the national anthem to the \"Black National Anthem\" while mandating that churches teach black liberation theology. Also, it said Obama would appoint Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the Cabinet and put prominent blacks like Oprah Winfrey on currency. McCain's campaign dropped May from his job.</p> <p>\u2022 In West Plains, Missouri, a remote town of 10,000 people near the Arkansas border, a prominent highway sign by an unknown creator shows a turban-wearing cartoon caricature of Obama, with an exaggerated smile, full lips and oversized teeth. It says: \"Barack 'Hussein' Obama equals more abortions, same-sex marriages, taxes, gun regulations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So what do we have here? One unknown group in Sacramento has run some ads reminding voters that Obama's decades-long pastor and spiritual adviser is pretty radical. The fact that Wright is black doesn't make that a racist argument. If McCain had sat in the pew for 20 years <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/YELL/falwell.html\">listening to a pastor</a> who said, say, that \"the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians are responsible for the 9/11 attacks because they caused God to withdraw his protection for America,\" you can bet that would be an issue.</p> <p>Otherwise, the AP has found three individuals in remote towns who have directed racial slurs at the first black candidate with a real chance to be president. That's pretty remarkable. We've made great progress since the civil rights revolution, but who would have guessed there'd be so little backlash?</p> <p>That won't stop journalists from looking for it, though. Google \"Obama racism\", and you'll find hits like <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2198397/\">\"Racism is the only reason Obama might lose\"</a> (because of course the most liberal Democrat in the Senate would be a shoo-in otherwise) and <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2008/02/20/racist-attacks-on-obama-growing-more-heated/\">\"Racist attacks on Obama growing more heated\"</a> (yes, on white supremacist and neo-Nazi websites) and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/19/racist-obama-effigy-hung_n_135971.html\">\"Racist Obama effigy hung in Ohio\"</a> (yes, one guy in rural Ohio hung a white-sheeted ghost labelled \"Obama\" in his yard, and his white neighbours are appalled).</p> <p>On the web Sunday we got the headline <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14728.html\">\"'Socialist', 'Muslim' \u2013 Ugly reception for Obama\"</a>, who campaigned in the Cape Fear BBQ and Chicken in Fayetteville, North Carolina. But in fact it appears that there was just one woman who shouted \"socialist\" at him and also told a reporter that she suspected he was a \"closet Muslim\". The other white diners told her to quiet down and be civil. Reporters descended on her, though, and she did manage to direct a slur at General Colin Powell, who had endorsed Obama that morning: She called him \"a Rino, R-I-N-O, Republican In Name Only\".<br> Compared to the level of open <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/reader/1403962529/ref=sib_rdr_toc?ie=UTF8&amp;p=S004&amp;j=0#reader-page\">anti-Catholic bias against John Kennedy</a> in 1960, racism in the 2008 campaign is a dog that didn't bark.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/22/giulianis-nasty-robocall_n_136926.html\">new sleazy robocall from Rudy Giuliani</a>, whose text is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hi, this is Rudy Giuliani and I'm calling for John McCain and the Republican National Committee, because you need to know that Barack Obama opposes mandatory prison sentences for sex offenders, drug dealers, and murderers. It's true, I read Obama's words myself. And recently, Congressional liberals introduced a bill to eliminate mandatory prison sentences for violent criminals -- trying to give liberal judges the power to decide whether criminals are sent to jail or set free. With priorities like these, we just can't trust the inexperience and judgment of Barack Obama and his liberal allies. This call was paid for by the Republican National Committee and McCain-Palin 2008.</p> </blockquote> <p>As HuffPo notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>It should be noted that Obama has said he would \"immediately review sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the ineffective warehousing of nonviolent drug offenders.\" His stance is bolstered by several studies of criminal behavior which show that \"mandatory minimum sentences are less effective than discretionary sentencing and drug treatment in reducing drug-related crime.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Giuliani, as a New Yorker, knows this to be true with regard to non-violent drug offenders. New York is home to the infamous Rockefeller guidelines, which treated nonviolent drug offenders practically like murderers -- long, mandatory sentences. Rockfeller was Nelson Rockefeller, the GOP governor of New York back in the 60s and 70s who, in an effort to shed his moderate image, pressed for the get-tough approach. They've been a disaster for New York, as it costs billions to keep non-violent offenders in prison for 20 or 30 years. As the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_drug_laws\">Wiki entry</a> says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Both the New York and Michigan statutes came under harsh criticism from both the political left and the political right (William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative public figures in America, was staunchly against it, as well as many in law enforcement), who saw inherent unfairness in placing the non-violent crime of drug trafficking on a par with murder. The laws also drew intense opposition from civil rights advocates, who claimed that they were racist, as they were applied inordinately to African-Americans, and to a lesser extent, Latinos.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Giuliani will say anything. He forgot the part about how Obama really wants to let all urban criminals go free but wants offenders from small-town America to serve mandatory life sentences. That's a joke, folks.<br></p>",
  "<p>A detective who held Jean Charles de Menezes down as he was killed by police, today told how his colleagues almost shot him.</p> <p>The surveillance officer known only as Ivor told the inquest into De Menezes' death that he feared the innocent Brazilian's was a terrorist about to explode a bomb on a crowded London Underground carriage.</p> <p>De Menezes was held down and shot dead by police on a Tube carriage at Stockwell station on July 22 2005, a day after suicide bombers had attacked London's transport network.</p> <p>Ivor had followed the suspect, and was trying to establish whether he was Hussain Osman, one of four suspects who had staged the previous day's attacks.</p> <p>Ivor told the jury he never positively identified the man they were following as Osman and that the picture he had been issued with was of such poor quality it would have been impossible to make a positive identification.</p> <p>He followed De Menezes to Stockwell and offered to stop him before he could enter the underground network. Ivor said he was told not to, and so followed the suspect onto the Tube carriage.</p> <p>There he sat next to him and then saw armed officers on the platform, peering into the carriage looking for the suspect.</p> <p>Ivor told the jury: \"I placed my left foot against the open carriage door to prevent it shutting. I shouted 'he's here' and indicated to Mr de Menzes with my right hand.\"</p> <p>He said he could hear lots of shouting from the platform, including the word \"police\". But Ivor told the jury he did not hear any police officer shout a direct verbal warning or challenge to De Menezes before he was shot.</p> <p>As armed officers rushed on to the carriage, Ivor said the Brazilian stood up: \"As I looked at him, he appeared agitated and I noticed his hands were below his waist and slightly in front of him. He appeared to look left and right.</p> <p>\"Assessing that I may be dealing with a terrorist subject, and naturally fearing for the safety of the public on the carriage, the armed officers and myself, I grabbed Mr de Menezes, by wrapping both my arms around his torso, thereby pinning his arms to his side.</p> <p>\"I pushed him back onto the seat where he had previously been sitting. I had the right-hand side of my head pressed against the right-hand side of his torso.</p> <p>\"Obviously I had to make an assessment within seconds as to what I may be dealing with.\"</p> <p>Ivor said the appearance of armed officers made him believe \"the intelligence picture\" had dramatically changed as to the danger the suspect posed. </p> <p>That plus De Menezes' movement downward with his hands once he had got up from his seat, raised Ivor's fears. </p> <p>\"Obviously the waist band was an area of concern,\" he told the jury, a reference to a briefing officers had received that morning that the suspect they were hunting may be armed with suicide bomb belts.</p> <p>Ivor, giving evidence from behind a screen, said: \"My assessment was that he may be a terrorist subject and therefore he may be carrying arms or explosives ... My actions were instinctive and I was concerned that he may be looking to detonate some sort of device. </p> <p>\"Equally I was concerned he may be trying to access some form of weaponry.\"</p> <p>Ivor said he knew it would be painful for De Menezes' family in court to hear his testimony.</p> <p>He said that as he held De Menezes down, armed officers reached over him and opened fire. </p> <p>\"I heard a gun shot very close to my left ear, and I was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage. I recall as the gunshot went off being hit by the shockwave of the weapon. Prior to this I was aware of Mr de Menezes turning his head slightly towards me.\"</p> <p>Ivor said he heard several shots and was dragged onto the carriage floor, ending up on his knees: \"I looked up and could see an armed officer wearing a chequered cap. It was my assessment that he had assisted in dragging me away ... he had a long-barrelled weapon and at that stage it appeared to be levelled at my chest. </p> <p>\"I was also aware of being held from behind, so ... I moved to a seated position on the floor and shouted 'police' as loud as I could.\"</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",
  "<p>The high court yesterday condemned as \"deeply disturbing\" a refusal by the US government to disclose evidence that could prove a British resident in Guant\u00e1namo Bay was tortured before confessing to terrorist offences.</p> <p>The court said there was \"no rational basis\" for the US failure to reveal the contents of documents essential to the defence of Binyam Mohamed, who faces the death penalty.</p> <p>In a particularly damning passage, Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones said claims by his lawyers that the US was refusing to release the papers because \"torturers do not readily hand over evidence of their conduct\" could not be dismissed and required an answer.</p> <p>The judges said they were unaware of any precedent of such serious allegations against \"the government of a foreign friendly state and our oldest and closest ally\" as those made in this case.</p> <p>The US had not provided any explanation for its conduct though it had had \"ample time\" to do so, the judges said. </p> <p>Thomas and Lloyd said the documents provided the \"only independent evidence\" capable of helping Mohamed and his defence. Suppressing the material \"would be to deny him the opportunity of timely justice in respect of the charges against him\", which was a principle dating back to \"at least the time of Magna Carta and which is a basic part of our common law and of democratic values\".</p> <p>They said David Miliband, the foreign secretary, conceded there was an \"arguable case\" that Mohamed had been subjected to torture and inhuman treatment. Yet Miliband also wanted to suppress relevant documents, not because they would reveal any intelligence operations but because the US claimed that if they were disclosed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/usa.usforeignpolicy\">serious harm would be done</a> to \"intelligence sharing\" between the UK and the US.</p> <p>The judges said it was clear Britain had \"facilitated\" Mohamed's interrogation when he was unlawfully detained in Pakistan before he was secretly rendered to Morocco, Afghanistan, and then to Guant\u00e1namo. The US was using confessions made after two years of unlawful \"incommunicado detention\" on charges where the death penalty might be sought, the judges said yesterday.</p> <p>They noted that a military prosecutor at the US base had recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/guantanamo.terrorism\">resigned</a> in protest against the treatment of prisoners, including the use of a \"frequent flyer programme\". The judges described this as a \"euphemism for a sleep deprivation programme\". They added: \"This is a practice which the United Kingdom expressly prohibits.\"</p> <p>Charges against Mohamed\u2014 including that he was involved in a dirty bomb plot \u2014 have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/guantanamo-usa\">dropped</a>, allegedly to prevent the US from revealing torture evidence. The US authorities now planned to charge him with other offences, the judges noted yesterday.</p> <p>The judges took the extraordinary step of inviting the media to challenge previous decisions to hold many of the case's hearings in camera. </p> <p>\"Although the argument took place in closed session,\" they said, \"the issue is one of considerable importance in the context of open justice [and] to the rule of law.\"</p> <p>They suspended proceedings pending a case in the US courts where defence lawyers are also trying to force disclosure. That federal court, the British judges said yesterday, might be given explanations about US conduct \"denied to this court\".</p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, the director of the charity, Reprieve, described Mohamed's treatment by the US as a \"litany of misconduct\". </p> <p>\"First they tortured him, then they held him for more than six years without trial, now they want to cover up evidence that could set him free,\" he said. \"What is the point of a 'special relationship' if the UK Government cannot secure basic justice for Mr Mohamed?\" </p> <p>Richard Stein, one of Mohamed's lawyers, said: \"The grave concerns expressed by the court about the dealings of the Americans in this case are not surprising, given the torture Mr Mohamed has suffered. This underlines the British government's duty to do more than gently nudge its ally across the Atlantic when it comes to criminal acts taken against a British resident.\"</p> <p>Mohamed, 30, an Ethiopian national and British resident, was held in Pakistan in 2002, when he was questioned by an MI5 officer. He was later secretly rendered to Morocco, where he says he was tortured by having his penis cut with a razor blade. The US subsequently flew him to Afghanistan and he was transferred to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in September 2004.</p>",
  "<p>The last words in the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd081022/banc-8.htm\">83-page judgment</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/22/chagos-islanders-lose\">delivered on Wednesday by the law lords</a> in the case of the Chagossian islanders are those of <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/sks/kr2/kr2.htm\">Richard II</a>: \"It boots thee not to be compassionate; after our sentence plaining comes too late.\" </p> <p>Certainly, there is something of a Shakespearean tragedy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/22/lords-humanrights\">what has happened to the Chagossian islanders</a> since they were evicted from their homes to make way for the US military base on Diego Garcia nearly 40 years ago. And certainly, there has been nothing compassionate about the behaviour of the British government in the treatment of them over the years.</p> <p>The law lords have now ruled, by the narrowest of margins, that the Chagossians have no right to return. While there remains the possibility of taking the case to the European court of human rights, there is no disguising the fact that the lords' ruling is a bitter blow to the islanders. They had arrived at the lords with the wind of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/24/politics.topstories3\">two favourable judgments</a>, from the divisional and appeal courts, in their sails \u2013 and some had even pledged that they would set off by sea before Christmas had the ruling gone their way. </p> <p>It was in 2000 that the then foreign secretary, Robin Cook, made it clear that he supported the islanders' case. It seemed only a matter of time before a small number of them returned to see if it was possible to recreate what was described by their lawyer, Richard Gifford, as \"paradise lost\". Then came 9/11 and the insistence of the US that Diego Garcia, the island at the heart of the archipelago, was an essential \"linchpin\" in their security network, vital for the bombing missions on Afghanistan and, more recently, Iraq. </p> <p>What the Americans had not said was that that Diego Garcia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/03/terrorism.usforeignpolicy\">would also be used</a> for \"rendering\" prisoners en route to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>Almost everyone agrees that the Chagossians were shabbily treated, to say the least, but there does not seem to be anyone in government prepared to right the wrong. Robin Cook and that \"ethical\" foreign policy now seem as remote as the islands themselves.</p> <p><em>Was the law lords' decision on the Chagos islanders' right to return just? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/poll/2008/oct/22/law-humanrights\">Vote here</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Gazprom has produced record quarterly figures on the back of a 72% increase in the value of exports to Europe, but the heavily indebted Russian group warned the credit crunch could hit its cashflow.</p> <p>The world's largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gas\">gas</a> producer earned $18.5bn (\u00a311.4bn) from European sales in the first quarter, triggering more harsh criticism in the west about its decision to establish a gas cartel with Iran and Qatar that could drive up prices further.</p> <p>Domestic sales at Gazprom grew by only 2% and are now worth less than half its European business, while sales to former members of the Soviet Union slumped by 20%. </p> <p>Profits rose by 30% to more than $10bn but the company, which has a monopoly on exports from Russia and supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, admitted the global liquidity squeeze would make life harder.</p> <p>\"Such circumstances could affect the ability of the group to obtain new borrowings and refinance its existing borrowings at terms and conditions similar to those applied to earlier transactions,\" Gazprom said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Deteriorating operating conditions for borrowers may also have an impact on management's cashflow forecasts and assessment of the impairment of financial and non-financial assets.\" </p> <p>Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller, said earlier this month he saw no short-term risks from the global financial crisis as his company was enjoying record gas prices and had no urgent need to borrow. Analysts said the company's debts of $40bn were still relatively small, given the profits generated and the scale of its business.</p> <p>But Artyom Konchin, an analyst at Aton Capital in Moscow, said Gazprom's share price had slumped 70% to give the group a value of $100bn, partly because it had failed to convince investors that the scale of investments it wanted to make could be justified at a time when demand may be hit by global economic slowdown. </p> <p>\"Minority investors in particular want to know where the value is coming from,\" Konchin said.</p> <p>Gazprom announced on Monday it was establishing a \"big gas troika\" with Iran and Qatar, described by the Iranian oil minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, as a \"gas Opec\".</p> <p>David Clark, a former special adviser to the Foreign Office and a chairman of the UK-based Russia Foundation, said he was alarmed by the move. \"It is a clear attempt by Russia and other countries to increase their leverage and use energy as a geopolitical weapon. It is time the European Union ensured that Russia was bound by a rules-based relationship that it had signed up to with the energy charter treaty.\" </p> <p>Clark said it was ominous that the three countries involved in the potential cartel specifically talked about liquefied natural gas (LNG). \"They clearly realise that LNG offers gas-importing countries different supply options and is an area they want to control,\" he said.</p> <p>The European commission said it would expect to be notified of any move to create such an arrangement, which could prompt the EU to revise its energy policy. </p> <p>\"In principle, the commission is against cartels for the sale and marketing of products, and hydrocarbons are no exception to that,\" said the commission's energy spokesman, Ferr\u00e1n Tarradellas Espuny. \"We believe the best conditions for the sale of a product such as gas are a free and transparent market.\" </p> <p>Two of Europe's biggest gas distributors, GDF Suez and E.ON, said the troika could be useful. </p> <p>\"We have the feeling that the forum project is not necessarily a cartel \u2014 if it was we would condemn it \u2014 but that it is a place for dialogue and we would be prepared to regard it favourably,\" said G\u00e9rard Mestrallet, the chief executive of GDF Suez, France's biggest gas utility. </p> <p>Bernhard Reutersberg, the chairman of E.ON Ruhr gas, said he was not \"really\" concerned as his company was shielded by long-term supply contracts.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Gothenburg, Sweden. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Henning F\u00fcrst (music), Eric Berglund (vocals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> The Tough Alliance are a strange bunch. We say bunch, but actually there are only two of them, but this duo create more fuss, at least in their homeland, than most four or five-piece bands. Their sound is bright and breezy electro-pop, a bit like early Depeche Mode, before they went all industrial and moody and Dave Gahan swapped frilly chemises for tattoos and narcotics. Yet their songs have titles like Neo Violence and First Class Riot.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on stage they wield baseball bats and have a reputation for glorifying mindless thuggery. \"Forget about labour / It's time to wake the neighbours,\" they sing on one song, while on an early tracks of theirs, Koka-Kola Veins, frontman Berglund declares, \"We've got our own jihad, if you know what I mean.\" To be honest, we don't. Another tune offers the simple manifesto: \"Break the rules.\" Only they don't, really - in fact, musical rules are mostly strictly adhered to, although it's a bit hotchpotch, suggesting they're too young to remember, or distinguish between, who was cool out of the early-80s synthpop brigade and who was crud. This might explain why they're as likely to recall the dolorous beauty of New Order as they are someone distinctly sub-par like Howard Jones. <br> The pair, who this month appear on the front cover of the prestigious US rock-mag Fader, may make claims for subversion - \"Truly sorry, thought you'd get the wink\", they sing on Neo Violence - but it remains unclear who or what they think they're subverting. Mainstream pop? The X Factor hegemony (they make no attempt to hide the fact that they're lip-synching onstage)? Our safe notions of what constitutes musical joyousness and its mythical counterpart, \"edge\"? Certainly there is a disparity between the clean, shiny positivity of the production, choruses and hooks, and the messages of rejection and rebellion contained within the lyrics. They nod twice to Spacemen 3, they've recorded a synth-tastic version of Primal Scream's Velocity Girl under the title Velocity Boy (\"Here he comes again / With vodka in his veins / Been playing with a spike\"). They even covered 50 Cent on an early EP, and spiked an upbeat love song with the words, \"I don't give a flying fuck.\"  Unlike previous provocative electro-pop double-acts from DAF to the KLF however, they've apparently made a conscious decision to not match their lyrical barbs with brutally insistent dance beats, opting instead for lilting melodiousness, as though they want to secrete dangerous ideas into the charts. It's a bold initiative. We're just at a loss as to what the point of it all is.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Their joyous brand of Scandinavian party pop snatches the best synth music from the past three decades.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> If the music was as gorgeously melodic as the words are gritty and galvanising, we'd have no problem with it, but it's no less chirpily ingratiating than the stuff they appear to be critiquing.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Fall victim, as per their \"wonky pop\" Scandinavian peers Annie, and Alphabeat, to their own intelligence.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Achieve the pop success they appear to deconstruct yet simultaneously crave. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The album A New Chance is released on Monday by Modular. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Depeche Mode, Howard Jones, OMD, New Order.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/toughalliancemusic\">MySpace.com/toughalliancemusic</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Burning Pilot</p>",

It is not illegal to accept a donation from a registered UK company, but could be in breach of section 61 of the 2000 political parties law to enter into or \"act in furtherance of\" an arrangement which disguised an overseas donation.</p> <p>In his detailed statement last night, Osborne insisted that at no point did he or Feldman \"suggest ways of channelling a donation\".</p> <p>Rothschild, an old and close friend of Osborne's, went public after he became enraged at the way in which the shadow chancellor had abused his hospitality. He was furious that Osborne breached confidences about his conversations with Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, while the politicians were private guests at Rothschild's luxury Corfu villa in August.</p> <p>Osborne has been seen as the source of malicious newspaper stories that Mandelson had \"dripped poison\" about Gordon Brown in private conversations, and also that Mandelson held potentially controversial meetings with Deripaska on his \u00a318m yacht, moored near the villa of Rothschild, a friend and business partner of Deripaska.</p> <p>On a day when some of the biggest political reputations at Westminster were at stake, it became clear that Rothschild, the son of the merchant banker Lord Rothschild, was so infuriated by Osborne's discourtesy that he was prepared to wreck their friendship. </p> <p>This prompted Tory claims that Mandelson, bent on revenge, must have manipulated Rothschild into causing Osborne such political embarrassment. </p> <p>At lunchtime yesterday, Osborne issued a limited denial of Rothschild's claims by saying he had not solicited money from Deripaska, and no money had been taken. \"We did not ask for any money, we did not receive any,\" he said.</p> <p>Sources close to Rothschild immediately insisted this limited denial obscured the fact that Osborne and Feldman had enthusiastically discussed the possibility of securing the donation from Deripaska. Rothschild accepts there was no direct conversation with the Russian, but says the Conservatives had discussed the issue with him.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon, Osborne issued a fuller statement, admitting he had met Deripaska four times in one weekend in Corfu, and that in the presence of Rothschild, Feldman and two other witnesses he had indeed discussed a donation from Deripaska. But he portrayed Rothschild as the initiator of the discussion.</p> <p>Osborne said that, in the discussion on the terrace of the villa, \"Rothschild suggested to Feldman that his friend Mr Deripaska could be interested in making a donation.\" </p> <p>Osborne's account continued: \"Feldman at this point made clear there are very strict rules on donations to political parties in the UK. Feldman explained a political donation is only lawful if you appear as an individual on the UK electoral roll, or if the donation comes from a legitimate UK trading company.\"</p> <p>At this point, according to Osborne's account, \"Rothschild said that Mr Deripaska owned UK trading companies including Leyland DAF\", a Midlands-based vehicle firm. He insisted \"there was no discussion about how a donation could be concealed or channelled\".</p> <p>If a donation had come from the Leyland DAF board, ordered by Deripaska, it would have been arguable whether it was lawful since the company might have been acting as an agent for a foreign donor.</p> <p>After the discussion at the villa, Rothschild arranged for Osborne and Feldman to go aboard Deripaska's yacht in his company, but Osborne insists no discussion of a donation occurred at this one-hour meeting, even though Feldman, the party's chief fundraiser and an old schoolfriend of Cameron's, was present.</p> <p>Allies of Rothschild's appeared last night to corroborate this account. Osborne insists he had no further conversations on a donation, but he says Rothschild suggested in a phone call on September 18 with Feldman that Leyland DAF was interested in making a donation.</p> <p>According to the Tory account, Feldman at this point considered whether such a donation would be appropriate and after discussion with party officials decided it would not be, so ending the possibility.</p> <p>Allies of Deripaska's weighed in against Osborne's implication that he initiated talks, saying the billionaire \"has never donated to any political party in Britain and he has no intention of doing so\".</p> <p>Last night Rothschild further challenged details of Osborne's version of events, saying he had discussed the possibility of a donation from the oligarch via DAF with Osborne before they met Deripaska. In further conflict with Osborne's story, he said the issue of a donation was again raised in talk on Deripaska's yacht.</p> <p>After the meeting on the yacht, Rothschild claims the subject was raised again over dinner and \"Osborne was interested in whether and how such a donation could be secured\". </p> <p>He also claims the Tories were still interested when he raised the issue with Feldman in September. Rothschild said: \"I was left with the impression the Conservative party remained interested.\" He added that another guest at his villa, James Goodwin, a consultant, was willing to corroborate his account.</p> <p>Friends of Rothschild's last night defended his behaviour, and his decision to stand by Mandelson, a friend for 10 years, rather than Osborne, his older friend and closer political ally.</p> <p>One said: \"There is a long history in British politics in which people from other political parties meet and discuss the state of their parties and remain discreet about it. He [Rothschild] is doubly angry in that his mother had been funding Osborne's office for years.\"</p> <p>Cameron fully backed Osborne, who may yet face questioning for failing to declare he and his family had stayed at Rothschild's villa. He said: \"At no point did he ask for any money and the Conservative party didn't receive any money. That is the absolutely vital point.\"</p> <p>In his letter to the shadow chancellor, MacShane asks a series of questions about Osborne the series of events in Corfu.</p> <p>The MP demands to know:</p> <p>\u2022 if Osborne had a conversation with Rothschild about a donation to the Conservative party,</p> <p>\u2022 if Osborne arranged for Feldman to meet with Deripaska,</p> <p>\u2022 if a further discussion took place with Rothschild about a donation,</p> <p>\u2022 if Osborne knew that Deripaska was a Russian national and any donation had to be made by a UK company,</p> <p>\u2022 if Osborne was involved in a discussion about Leyland DAF,</p> <p>\u2022 if Osborne made a follow-up phone call to Rothschild to check on whether such a contribution would be made, and</p> <p>\u2022 if Osborne would confirm that it was Deripaska who decided he did not want to make a donation.</p> <p>In response, a Conservative spokesman said: \"The prime minister's statement in the Commons and Denis MacShane's letter are a desperate attempt to keep this story going. All the questions raised in Denis MacShane's letter are dealt with in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/21/georgeosborne-oleg-deripaska\">yesterday's statement from George Osborne and Andrew Feldman</a>.</p> <p>\"The person who hasn't answered any questions is Peter Mandelson, who should immediately set out a detailed account of his numerous dealings with Mr Deripaska.\"</p>",
  "<p>As you are aware, a number of serious allegations have been made against you in the media, and regardless of your repeated assertion that there has been no wrongdoing because no donation was received from Mr [Oleg] Deripaska, serious questions still need to be answered.

  "<p><strong>BECK HOME (NEARLY)</strong></p> <p>The Designated Player Rule in Major League Soccerball allows every franchise to sign one player whose personal terms are not affected by the league's salary cap regulations. Allowing clubs to compete for the very best talent in the international game, it is known colloquially as the Beckham Rule, and shatters the myth that Americans don't do irony.</p> <p>Possibly fed up with being a figure of fun across a whole continent, Beckham has seemingly decided to leave LA Galaxy and join AC Mil... oh dear. Will you look at the state of their squad! The spine of the team - club captain Paolo Maldini, star striker Gianni Rivera and Brazilian goalkeeper Moacyr Barbosa - are all getting on a bit. Defensive midfielder <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emerson_Ferreira_da_Rosa&amp;oldid=246937613\">Emerson is, according to Wikipedia, 70 years old</a>. And Andriy Shevchenko, 53, hasn't scored a competitive goal since 1999 (the same year, coincidentally, lynchpin defender Philippe Senderos is last thought to have closed his mouth).</p> <p>And now they're adding Becks to a heady mix that also includes the silky talents of Ronaldinho, when he can be bothered to use them, which is not often, bordering on never. \"Beckham wants to train and play for Milan,\" announced Adriano Galliani, the club's vice-president. \"Football today is about full stadiums and sponsors and superstars like Beckham fill them up,\" Galliani went on to explain as part of a lecture entitled Why Football Is Not Worth Bothering About Any More. Of course this move, to be effected on January 1, doesn't mean Beckham is no longer an object of extreme irony. For Milan is known as the style capital of the world, and will therefore be an interesting home for a man sporting a tattoo which looks like someone has gaffer-taped a house brick to the back of his neck.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Everyone makes mistakes\" - Mohammed Ahmed, first team coach at Al Ahli, sticks up for UAE star striker Faisal Khalil, who has been arrested on suspicion of casting \"black magic\" spells on other players in order to maintain his place in the national team.</p> <p>****************</p> <p><strong>WIN, LOSE OR SCORE</strong></p> <p><strong>Guardian Fantasy Football</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">play it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Pick the Score</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://guardian.pickthescore.co.uk/\">pick it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Soulmates</strong></p> <p>Go on, dig out <a href=\"http://dating.theguardian.com/s/\">your soulmate</a> (or at the very least, your next damp, tufty and squelchy one-night stand).</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>THE BEST IS YET TO COME</strong></p> <p>Not since The Crying Game have goods been quite so deceptively packaged. Ostensibly, tonight's Big Cup meetings between Chelsea and Roma and Atletico Madrid and Liverpool are potential humdingers, and certainly wouldn't look out of place as quarter-final fixtures. Yet in the context of the group stages their meaning is <em>this</em> close to eff all, and frankly the Fiver would rather let a freshly cattle-prodded marmot run amok in its Captain America grundies while watching <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/calumbest\">Totally Calum Best: The Best Is Yet To Come</a>, a show in which Best endeavours to \"survive\" 50 days of celibacy than endure either match. </p> <p>Uefa, like Best, is in possession of an out-of-control monster that someone needs to put under lock and key for the good of society. Yes, the G14-driven Big Cup is a fact of modern life, but then so are Tim Lovejoy, The Buk Wot Tim Lovejoy Rote, and the tragic ostracism of the comma. It doesn't make them right, and a six-strikes-and-you're-still-not-necessarily-out makes for the sort of preamble even a rambling tea-time email would baulk at. Contrast that with, for example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Cup_1978-79\">1978-79 European Cup</a>, when due to an unseeded knockout draw the champions of Europe, Liverpool, were put out of Europe even before Seasonal Affective Disorder had kicked in, by the champions of England, Nottingham Forest.</p> <p>The most relevant imponderable of the night probably relates to whether Atletico Madrid fans will boo Liverpool's black players. \"There is no problem with r@cism in Spain,\" said Liverpool's Spanish keeper Jose Reina. \"Spain is not a r@cist country and Madrid is not a r@cist city,\" he added, burying his head so far in the sand that he inadvertently made the most significant archaeological discovery of the 21st century.

  "<p>Ministers came under fire in the Commons today over \"tactics\" used to limit, and possibly block altogether, debate on abortion law. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that Harriet Harman, the leader of the Commons, was planning to block a series of parliamentary votes to liberalise Britain's abortion laws through a raft of amendments to the human fertilisation and embryology bill planned by pro-choice MPs.</p> <p>These included liberalising abortion controls by pushing for changes that would allow one doctor, rather than two, to approve an abortion and to legalise the procedure in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Anti-abortion MPs were also seeking amendments after their bid to shorten the time limit from 24 weeks was defeated earlier this year. </p> <p>They want to see a committee of both Houses of Parliament set up to investigate and report on changes to the abortion law.</p> <p>Under a timetable motion tabled by the government, MPs will have just four and a half hours to debate a raft of amendments to the human fertilisation bill. </p> <p>New clauses on the law relating to abortion are at the end of the list and unlikely to be reached.</p> <p>Backbench Labour rebel Diane Abbott, who has tabled a clause to the bill to extend the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland for the first time said: \"It seems to me that this programme motion and particularly the order of discussion is a shabby manoeuvre by ministers to stop full debate on some very important matters.\"</p> <p>It was important to be able to discuss the \"special case\" of Northern Ireland, she said.</p> <p>\"If we do not debate my new clause today, women in Northern Ireland will lose the opportunity to have the rights that women in the rest of the UK have enjoyed for 40 years. They will lose that right for a generation.\"<br> Faced with a series of protests about the timetable, the Speaker, Michael Martin, insisted that all the amendments, including those on abortion, were \"within the scope\" of the bill.</p> <p>He confirmed that the government's programme motion in effect changed the order of business and insisted: \"The house, if it so wishes, can vote that down.\"</p> <p>Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor, attacked the \"politically cynical\" move and said it was the first time MPs had been allowed the chance to discuss abortion in government time since 1990. </p> <p>The subject was \"very important\" and there was \"an enormous range of opinion\" among MPs and the public. </p> <p>He shared his suspicion that the Scottish byelections - the Glasgow East byelection in July and the forthcoming byelection in Glenrothes in two weeks' time - had determined the progress of the bill \"all the way through\".</p> <p>He said: \"Cynicism would take my breath away if I was not becoming ever more accustomed to this process on the part of a control-freak government that regards the House of Commons as an embarrassing nuisance to be silenced on all suitable occasions.\"</p> <p>The bill itself has attracted controversy for its central measures, which include allowing scientists to carry out research on human-animal hybrids, relaxing guidance to make it easier for lesbians and single women to have IVF treatment and letting parents choose \"saviour siblings\" for seriously ill children. </p> <p>Dawn Primarolo, the health minister, opening debate on the timetable, said that the bill's provisions had a potentially profound impact. </p> <p>\"One in seven couples need help with fertility treatment, 350,000 people live with Alzheimer's, every week there are five children born and three young people die from cystic fibrosis - all issues that this bill addresses.\" </p> <p>Without mentioning the abortion issue, she said today was the last opportunity for MPs to debate the bill before it returned to the Lords. </p> <p>Primarolo said: \"We have amendments which cover embryo research, the definition of embryos, the parenthood of people who receive assisted reproduction treatment, and saviour siblings. </p> <p>\"These are matters that go to the heart of the bill and need consideration before the bill finally leaves this chamber.\" </p> <p>Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrats health spokesman, said his party also had a free vote on the bill. He told MPs he would oppose the programme motion because there had been no consultation and ministers could have provided two days of debate. </p> <p>Citing newspaper reports that suggested there might have been \"some secret deal\" to avoid debate on abortion, he said: \"The government has indicated that it is not appropriate to debate these issues at this time. If that is the case, when is an appropriate occasion to debate abortion issues?\" </p> <p>Frank Field, the Labour former minister, who wants to see a reduction in abortion limits, called for a joint select committee of both houses to see how the laws could be reformed. </p> <p>He said: \"I think the way we go about in this place debating abortion, picking bits and pieces off as though we were at a bingo, is not an appropriate way to consider a major issue.\" </p> <p>He added: \"My own preference would be that we should make abortion much easier earlier on and much tougher later on.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's plenty of worry around at the moment \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/pound-recession-interest-rates\">governor of the Bank of England</a> is worried about the imminent recession. People are worried about losing their jobs and negative equity in their homes. People will be worried about the pressure then on their relationships. Worry is destructive. It consumes energy. It distracts attention from getting on with life. It keeps you awake at night. It is always worse at night.</p> <p>But it's alright. Supported by Evangelist Dawkins, atheists are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/religion-advertising\">emblazoning an answer</a> across our capital city for all to see: accept the probability that there is no God and you can stop worrying. This atheism is anything but theoretical. </p> <p>Jesus of Nazareth was in touch with real people and real life. <a href=\"https://secure.ebible.com/bible/Therefore+I+tell+you,+Do+not+worry+about+your+life,+what+you+will+eat%3B+or+about+your+body,+what+you+will+wear.+Life+is+more+than+food,+and+the+body+more+than+clothes.\">He said this</a>: \"Do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable are you than birds!\"</p> <p>For Jesus, the existence of a creator God and the evidence of his provision for birds of the air, was, contrary to what the campaign suggests, not an argument for, but specifically an argument against, worry.</p> <p>Jesus identified the origin of worry in the human desire for security and predictability. \"Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?\" He identified the human solution: to build storehouses to secure the enjoyment of life. He told of a man who built large storehouses to store his goods so that he could then take life easy. </p> <p>Jesus identified the flaw in this solution \u2013 thieves steal, moths corrupt, and death comes unannounced. </p> <p>Once in this hole, the human antidote to worry is to keep on digging: to seek ever more secure solutions. Much advertising and selling is based on this. Are you fully insured? Do you want to take out a five-year guarantee? Have you a burglar alarm?</p> <p>Jesus calls this solution folly and madness. He offers one simple antidote: God. God knows that people need food and clothes and shelter and security. God made us the way we are. \"Your Father knows you need them,\" he says. We just need to seek God's kingdom which he is pleased to give those who will receive it and \"all these things will be yours as well\".</p> <p>But will this solution be enjoyable \u2013 the other measure that bus advertisement employs? It may be secure, but will it be the security of a silent monastery?</p> <p>Jesus says there are two choices before us: life or death. He says that he offers life in abundance, overflowing, welling up, life that is eternal. </p> <p>We are faced with those who suggest that if we are not living our dream, then life is not worth living. This was tragically brought home last week with the debate around the very sad story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/17/law-switzerland\">Daniel James</a>, the rugby player, with a mum and dad, two sisters and a lovely home, who decided he did not want to live a \"second-class existence\". Who had suggested his paralysed existence was second class \u2013 in comparison with what? Jesus says: \"How much more valuable are you than birds.\" (Read Jesus' words in Luke <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A13-34\">12: 13-34</a> and <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010.10;&amp;version=31;\">John 10.10</a>).</p> <p>My late brother, an accountant, was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achondroplasia\">achondroplastic</a> \u2013 among his other accomplishments was as an actor in professional productions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Towards the end of his 54 years of life he said that in all likelihood under present legislation he might not have been allowed to live at all. Some might have considered his life, and his last six months in spinal paralysis, as second class. </p> <p>Human personhood, human enjoyment, and the value of life will always be measured. The question is, \"By what standard?\" Remove God, probably, and we are at the mercy of our own solutions to security, and other people's decisions about the value of our life. There's reason to worry.</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another eye-popping television <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/22/kerry-katona-this-morning\">chat show appearance by Kerry Katona</a>. She is currently publicising her new MTV documentary, Kerry Katona: Whole Again, in which cameras follow the progress of her recent plastic surgery, all the way to a sexy photo shoot in Marbella.</p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3mhWhUnaibw\">When she appeared on the This Morning sofa</a> opposite Philip Schofield and Fern Britton today, looking distracted and at times confused, slurring her words and almost unable to string a cogent sentence together, many viewers must have wondered what the producers were up to. The ones who weren't scrabbling for the record button and their mobile phones to tell their friends to switch to ITV1, that is.</p> <p>Yes, I know \u2013 television producers in unprincipled broadcast shocker! But there could have been no doubt that her general demeanour and specific responses (\"I am on meh-i-ay-sha an tha' swa ir iz\") pointed to a serious problem. One that producers surely can't claim they didn't notice until it was too late.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/realitytv\">reality TV</a> stalwart and former pop star was immediately defensive at the suggestion that she might have \"replaced one addiction with another\", as Britton gently put it, and could perhaps be drinking too much alcohol. Her eyes darted about as if looking for support when both Schofield and Britton tried to make the point that she's a very different girl from the one who sat opposite them a few years ago after winning ITV1's I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here.</p> <p>It was a compelling spectacle to see the once \"bubbly\" celebrity giving her interviewers the full passive-aggressive grimace as she slurred, \"Oh, I thought you were trying to say I was an alcoholic or something.\" But was it right to broadcast it?</p> <p>Surely when she arrived at the studios, production staff must've taken one look at her and seen she was incoherent, slurring and confused. So what did they do? Inform her management she wasn't fit for broadcast and send her on her way, or shove a camera in her face for viewers to lap up the grisly spectacle?</p> <p>Talking of her management, how unbelievably irresponsible do you have to be to make your 12% from the woes of a slowly disintegrating young woman? And what about our responsibility, sitting watching this ticking time bomb from the safety of our sofas?</p> <p>Without the erratic TV appearances, plastic surgery and constant stories of personal woe, you wouldn't have a product. The perfume, novels, autobiography and TV shows don't sell themselves, you know.</p> <p>What is the price of fame these days? If Katona's experience is anything to go by, all you have to do is relinquish control of your coping mechanism and let an unscrupulous management team guide you carefully through the choppy waters of tabloid intrusion and live TV. Don't worry, Kerry. You're in safe hands.</p> <p>We've all read the opinion columns likening reality TV to the open-house policy at Bedlam hospital in the darker days of British psychiatric care. But today's interview with Katona was the closest I've ever come to peering through the bars and staring at a howling unfortunate who is unable to shut the curtains and hide.</p> <p>Did producers shirk their responsibility in putting Katona on air? Or is it ultimately her own responsibility and should we stop feeling sorry for her?</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/22/georgeosborne-gordonbrown\">took Westminster by surprise this afternoon</a> when he said that he hoped the Osborne/Deripaska affair would be \"investigated by the authorities\". Briefing journalists immediately afterwards, his officials were unable to say who should investigate, or why?</p> <p>There are two bodies that tend to get involved in cases like this: the <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/\">Electoral Commission</a>; and the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/pcfs.cfm\">office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards</a>, John Lyon. But given that no money has changed hands, it could be difficult to get an inquiry off the ground.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission can investigate breaches of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the law that, among other things, bans foreign donations. But there's nothing in the act to say that soliciting a donation from a foreigner \u2013 which, of course, Osborne insists never happened anyway \u2013 is an offence. An official at the commission told me: \"We've seen no information to suggest that an offence has been committed.\"</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/andrew_porter/blog/2008/10/22/where_labour_thinks_george_osborne_has_erred\">Andrew Porter</a> reports, Denis MacShane thinks the act could apply to the Osborne case. Section 61 of the act, relating to \"offences concerned with evasion of restrictions on donations\", says a person commits an offence if he: </p> <blockquote> <p>knowingly does any act in furtherance of any arrangement which facilitates or is likely to facilitate, whether by means of any concealment or disguise or otherwise, the making of donations to a registered party by any person or body other than a permissible donor.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Again, I have to stress that Osborne does not accept soliciting, concealment, disguise etc etc. But when I put McShane's point to the Election Commission, I was told that they've looked at section 61 and that the key bit is the clause \"in furtherance of any arrangement\". The commission believes that, because no money was paid, there was no arrangement. They still think no offence has been committed.</p> <p>Lyon has a wider remit. He can investigate a complaint from anyone alleging that a member of parliament has broken the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmcode.htm\">code of conduct for MPs</a> (one document), or the rules relating to the conduct of MPs (<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmcode.htm\">another document</a>, mostly relating to the register of members' interests).</p> <p>Again, it's hard to see how anyone could get a complaint accepted. Osborne and his family spent a weekend at Nathaniel Rothschild's villa in Corfu and Osborne hasn't declared this in the register, which has a section for \"gifts, benefits and hospitality\". </p> <p>But this only covers hospitality etc that \"relates to membership of the house\". Osborne is confident that he did not need to register the visit because he was invited as an old friend of Rothschild's. There has never been an expectation that MPs should have to put something in the register whenever they stay the weekend with a mate.</p> <p>When I last checked (at 3pm) Lyon's office hadn't received a complaint. But, given what Brown said in the Commons, the Tories believe that someone is likely to try to get Lyon involved. </p> <p>The code contains plenty of generalised guff about the way MPs should behave \u2013 eg: \"Members should at all times conduct themselves in a manner which will tend to maintain and strengthen the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of parliament\" \u2013 and it's possible that a Labour backbencher (or activist) could cite this as grounds for a complaint.</p> <p>As I write, the only inquiry underway is one that MacShane has launched himself. He's written to Osborne with a series of questions. Lyon considers all the complaints he receives. But he will only launch a formal inquiry if he thinks there's a case to answer. Although a complaint may go in, it's much harder to imagine a formal investigation taking place.</p>",
  "<p>In the cold deep canyons of the Stanislaus River, James Anderson isn't worried about the stock market. The weak dollar doesn't bother him. Slumping home prices? No problem. He's got no house but a bed in the back of his 33-year-old Dodge van.</p> <p>Gold prices are up - and for Anderson and the legions of other prospectors scouring California's old mining sites, that justifies the tedious and back-breaking work.</p> <p>\"When you rinse it away and see the gold sitting there, it sends something through your blood,\" said Anderson, 68, who lives on Social Security and whatever nuggets, flakes and dust he finds in this rugged Mother Lode riverbed, near the town of Columbia in northwestern Tuolumne County. \"It's like an adrenaline shot.\"</p> <p>Stock market volatility, high metal prices and the popularity of outdoor adventure has triggered California's biggest mining boom in three decades. As gold more than doubled in the last decade - now approaching $800 an ounce - Americans are returning to the foothills, buying picks, filing mining claims and sifting for their fortune, though few ever get rich or even earn enough to pay for the gas to cover the trek.</p> <p>\"Gold's real. It is tangible, as opposed to what's in a bank. Who knows what will happen to it there?\" said Dr Eric Madrid, a Temecula, California-based physician who left the stock market and put his savings into gold coins.</p> <p>Madrid was among 80 members of the Gold Prospectors Association of America who recently gathered to dig at this historic site, named after Italian prospector Joaquin de Lucca, an illiterate but hardworking man who wore gold earrings and made a fortune in the late 1800s in this remote canyon, nicknamed \"pneumonia gulch\".</p> <p>In the past year, membership in the national club has climbed 25% - from 40,000 to 50,000. Inspired by rising gold prices and two prospecting shows on the Outdoor television channel, they arrive with pets and families. They bring picks and shovels, but also minivans, wetsuits, cellphones and generators.</p> <p>Equipment shops report a surge in business. \"We're getting phone calls from people all over the world, asking 'Where can I go? What can I do?' said Rob Goreham of 49er Mining Supplies in Columbia, California. \"They ask things like 'Where can I go to get gold?' It's nonsense. It's like another gold rush.\"</p> <p>Gold isn't as sophisticated as investments like derivatives and hedge funds. And though it's out-performed stocks in the past year - with gold rising 11% compared to stocks falling 22% - its long term track record hasn't been as lucrative: over the last two decades, gold rose 18%, while stocks on the S&amp;P 500 jumped 565%. But in uncertain economic times, gold offers deep emotional security. Even before the US Mint issued the first gold coins in 1795, Americans looked to the yellow metal as something to trust.</p> <p>\"It'll never turn into zero,\" said Ken Rucker, general manager of the prospectors association.</p> <p>For Walter Hills, who holds an explosives license and survived a rattlesnake bite while prospecting, it's about control. \"With stocks, you have to wait to see if it goes up or down. I can go out with my backhoe, dig to 9 feet, and start seeing my money right now.\"</p> <p>\"It's your own work,\" said Hills, who is retired and considers prospecting a hobby.</p> <p>That's the challenge. The early miners who came to these hills in the mid-1800s found and recovered the biggest nuggets and richest deposits. Chinese laborers followed them, recovering lower grade deposits and tailings. During the Depression, a third wave of desperate prospectors scoured these canyons.</p> <p>What's left is what those early miners, with their rudimentary techniques, couldn't find. Some fresh gold also has rinsed down hills during recent winter storms. But officials warn that only large-scale operations, handling \"tonnes of low-grade ore\", can really be profitable, according to the US Geological Survey.</p> <p>On a recent cold autumn morning in Italian Bar, after morning coffee and one verse of the national anthem, prospectors went to work. Some crouched on river rocks, panning. Others waded into the river, setting up powerful underwater vacuum cleaners called suction dredges. A few hiked steep trails with metal detectors. One team dug a deep ditch into an nearby ancient channel then fed heavy buckets of dirt into sluice boxes.</p> <p>Joking about the challenging terrain, Roy Davis of Delhi cracked: \"The rule of thumb is, if there's no poison oak, there's no gold.\"</p> <p>Buoyed by the camaraderie, they swapped romantic tales that have energised gold miners for generations. \"We found almost 10 ounces in one day - opened up the dredge box and found nothing but gold,\" said Davis.</p> <p>Recalled Rucker: \"Once I'm putting this pump back together and I look over at the waste pile - there was a piece of yellow rock, dead center. I started shaking.\"</p> <p>While many enjoy companionship, other prospectors scour the wilderness alone to stake a claim that might make them rich. More than 2,000 new mining claims were filed in California this year, according to state records. In 2005, there were 16,829 claims; now there are 24,905. It costs $170 to record a new claim, giving the holder mineral rights to the federal land.</p> <p>\"I get people coming in all the time who are out of work and desperate; intelligent people who see an advertisement for a mining claim and might try to buy it and make a living on it,\" said geologist Gregg Wilkerson of the Bureau of Land Management.</p> <p>Some people seek to live on mining claims after a home foreclosure, said Tim Carroll, also a BLM geologist. Others, taking advantage of current demand, \"just want to locate their claims to sell them on eBay or set up bogus operations to sell to the unsuspecting\".</p> <p>The new quest for gold is sending ill-prepared amateur prospectors into the state's dangerous abandoned mines, where there are still rich veins of gold, according to Wilkerson. Located in remote wilderness, they were ignored for decades; now, due to all-terrain vehicles, they are more easily accessible. In May, three young men died of carbon monoxide poisoning in an old Madera County mine. They were using a gas-powered pump to drain water from an abandoned mine.</p> <p>\"It's hard work. And people put their lives on the line,\" said Goreham.</p> <p>\"They don't realize the dangers. If you dig under a boulder, you get killed. Or shafts cave in, then next thing you know, you're dead. There could be methane gases. Or dead air. You feel fine and stir up the air, then walk out and drop dead. You never see it or smell it or nothing.\"</p> <p>In the season's fading sunlight, surrounded by the bubbling Stanislaus and russet-colored hills, Greg Foley of Kansas City, Mo., knows there are risks. He recognizes that any weekend discoveries won't offset the huge losses to his 401(k).</p> <p>\"But when I'm down in the river, I'm not worrying about anything,\" he said. \"Finding gold - that's just a bonus.\"</p>",
  "<p>The safety of Chinese products was under the spotlight again today as the UN called for \"urgent revision\" of the country's food supervision system and Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, pledged to crack down on unscrupulous suppliers.</p> <p>China has seen a spate of safety scares over goods ranging from dumplings to toys, and is already battling to shore up its exports in the face of an appreciating currency and the global downturn.</p> <p>In the most recent scandal, milk products contaminated with the chemical melamine killed four babies and left tens of thousands ill. There were product recalls and export bans around the world.</p> <p>In a report released today, the United Nations warns that China's food exports could plummet without changes including an overarching watchdog and a single food safety law covering the \"farm-to-fork\" journey.</p> <p>\"The national system needs urgent review and revision,\" said Khalid Malik, the UN's resident coordinator for China.</p> <p>The report warns that at present the onus is on officials to prove there is a problem, rather than on businesses to ensure their products are safe. It highlights weaknesses in monitoring and says poor coordination means different government departments sometimes give the public different advice.</p> <p>Jorgen Schlundt, the World Health Organisation's food safety chief, said the melamine case showed \"that a disjointed system with dispersed authority resulted in poor communication and maybe prolonged [the] outbreak with a late response\".</p> <p>Today it emerged that three more children in the Chinese territory of Macau have developed kidney stones after drinking milk from the companies involved; Hong Kong officials have found cake containing \"excessive\" amounts of melamine; and South Korea has destroyed 23 tonnes of tainted Chinese-processed egg products.</p> <p>Yesterday the Associated Press reported that 1,500 dogs in China had died after eating melamine-tainted feed.</p> <p>The chemical, often used in plastic and fertilisers, should not be added to food. Suppliers use it to hide the fact that they have illicitly watered down milk, which when tested will seem like it contains normal levels of protein. The UN report warns that safety concerns could threaten China's food exports, which reached $27bn (\u00a316.5bn) in 2006. It acknowledges that China's level of substandard exports is relatively low compared to those of other countries, and that China is overhauling its food safety regime.</p> <p>Wal-Mart, which buys around $9bn of goods from China annually, has announced rigorous new standards for suppliers covering issues from product quality to working conditions and environmental sustainability.</p> <p>Among the measures are a pledge to drive returns on defective merchandise \"virtually out of existence\" by 2012 and a promise to slash energy use in stores. Suppliers will have to tell the company the name and location of every factory they use.</p> <p>\"I firmly believe that a company that cheats on overtime and on the age of its labour, that dumps its scraps and chemicals in our rivers, that does not pay its taxes or honour its contracts, will ultimately cheat on the quality of its products,\" said Lee Scott, the company's chief executive, speaking in Beijing at a specially convened conference for suppliers.</p> <p>The company was built on rock-bottom prices, but Scott acknowledged it was \"very likely\" some of the changes would result in higher prices in stores, lower profits for the company and smaller margins for suppliers.</p> <p>\"When we have bought overseas, we have purchased historically in a very transactional manner. We need deeper, longer-term relationships with suppliers so they are not based upon the last penny but provide a quality product at a very good price.</p> <p>\"Will there be people today, who subcontract to factories we should never have brought from, who go bust? Yes.\"</p> <p>Wal-Mart is regularly accused of squeezing suppliers on cost, resulting in contractors pushing down wages. Unions are not allowed in Wal-Mart's US stores. It is the single biggest US importer of Chinese goods, and owns more than 100 stores in China itself as well as the Asda chain in Britain.</p> <p>Wal-Mart said the rules would initially apply to clothing and then be rolled out to all areas and countries by 2011.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/peterfincham\">Peter Fincham</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ITV\">ITV</a> director of television, has told advertisers that ITV1 has a \"gilt-edged\" position as the home of mass audience programming.</p> <p>He made the claim in his first presentation in the critical airtime trading season that will determine where budget-cutting companies will commit more than 90% of the \u00a33bn-plus TV ad spend for 2009.</p> <p>Fincham, the former controller of BBC1, made his presentation in London today to about 130 media agency executives who represent advertisers in negotiations with commercial broadcasters over next year's TV ad spend commitments.</p> <p>The pitch, which included presentations by the ITV managing director of brand and commercial, Rupert Howell, and its sales chief, Gary Digby, is the first of five that senior executives from the broadcaster will make in the runup to Christmas.</p> <p>\"As we head into difficult economic times entertainment is what the public is looking for us to do,\" Fincham said. </p> <p>\"[It is a] great advantage that [ITV executive chairman] Michael Grade is a TV man through and through. It is fatal to cut [programming] budgets,\" he added.</p> <p>\"I am glad at the moment we are not run by an accountant. I accept we are not in a world where next year's budgets will go galloping ahead but we are not going to take an axe to them.\"</p> <p>Fincham said that in 2008 ITV1's budget was \u00a3820m, ITV2's \u00a364m, ITV3's \u00a319m, ITV4's \u00a325.7m and CITV's \u00a33.5m.</p> <p>He added that that there was no sign that any other UK television channel would rival the \"gilt-edged stock\" of ITV1 as a \"full budget, mixed genre, huge channel with about 20% share of the market\".</p> <p>Fincham said he hoped in 2009 Law &amp; Order, the UK version of the US crime drama being made by Life on Mars producer Kudos, would be a \"long-running banker\" for ITV.</p> <p>Other shows highlighted from ITV1's 2009 schedule included the six-part remake of The Prisoner, Lynda LaPlante's Above Suspicion, the return of The Krypton Factor and the Primeval spin-off, Demons, starring Life on Mars actor Philip Glenister.</p> <p>Fincham said he hoped Demons would be an example of \"three-generational TV\" - shows that appeal to all ages. \"We are committed to finding more of that,\" he added.</p> <p>Digby told media buyers moving away from TV to media sectors such as online would be short-sighted, saying: \"TV still reaches the parts that other media can't reach.\"</p> <p>The sales chief added that in the year to the end of September, ITV had delivered 624 shows that exceeded 5 million viewers, while rival commercial broadcasters managed just seven.</p> <p>In terms of reaching ABC1 adults, Digby said ITV1 hit 8.6 million a day on average for three minutes or more, compared with 3.6 million for Facebook.</p> <p>And he added that ITV1 hit 3.9 million 15- to 34-year-old viewers a day on average compared with Facebook's 2.5 million.</p> <p>Digby admitted to media agency executives that the ITV airtime sales operation \"has sometimes faltered on the service we have given you\".</p> <p>But he said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/16/itv.advertising\">a restructure of the department</a> to make sure advertisers had better access to multiplatform opportunities would improve this.</p> <p>Howell added: \"There is a palpable goodwill toward ITV these days. A strong ITV benefits advertisers and agencies. Even in a downturn we can thrive. </p> <p>\"The question is not whether to cut - most brands will - the question is where.

  "<p>Since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India\">partition</a> in 1947, Kashmir has experienced a spectacular fall from grace. Once upon a time, its warm and soft name conjured up images of a Himalayan paradise suspended between the heavens and earth. </p> <p>Today, the mountainous state, caught between the territorial greed of India and Pakistan, evokes associations with conflict, strife and, above all, a tense standoff along a precipitous line of control between two nuclear-armed foes. Despite its troubled present, on a recent visit to Kashmir I found it still has the ability to charm \u2013 and it felt safe. </p> <p>Although the state is predominantly Muslim, its winter capital on the Indian side, Jammu, has a large and vibrant Hindu population and has provided shelter for Hindus fleeing the insurgency in the Kashmir valley. It is fondly known as the \"City of Temples\", which includes one inside Bahu fort where worshippers yearn to be splashed by the milk poured on holy goats. </p> <p>The fort and all the tourist sights in the region are complete security fortresses, reflecting an underlying official nervousness and fear of terrorist attacks. Although visitors are padded down and searched everywhere in India, in Jammu and Kashmir you must pass several checks and surrender your camera and bag, too. The never-ending army barracks not only blight the landscape but are also a nuisance to locals.</p> <p>Despite the inter-communal tensions that flare up in the city occasionally, I sensed little obvious hostility between Hindus and Muslims. Interestingly, Jammu is dotted with Sufi shrines, known as Durghahs, where people of all faiths flock to revere the Muslim mystics buried there. </p> <p>For sheer beauty and majesty, Srinagar, the state's summer capital, is the place to be. Its cool mountain atmosphere is welcome after the waterlogged air and soggy stickiness of the lower altitudes. </p> <p>The city's centrepiece is the magnificent and tranquil Dal Lake. My wife was intrigued to see whether the lake was really as icy blue as Kashmiri skies, as Salman Rushdie describes it. But it turned out that the weed and algae which are slowly choking the lake have turned it more emerald green than icy blue. Similarly, few Kashmiris actually possess eyes which are \"the astonishing blue of mountain sky,\" as Rushdie puts it. </p> <p>Since the British docked the first houseboats on Dal in Victorian times, the lake has evolved into a veritable floating community. Roving tailors, grocers, photo shops, and discreet offices also float by the houseboats on the backs of small boats called shikaras.</p> <p>Srinagar is famous for its stunning Mughal gardens, with their symmetry and flowing water. Young lovers, many arriving on the backs of motorbikes, wander together, not touching, through the parks. This phenomenon is deceptively liberal, one local explained, because most of the couples are courting within the confines of an arranged relationship. </p> <p>Although most people are friendly and welcomed us constantly to Kashmir, three religious-looking young men we passed several times caught our eyes. Their flashing white teeth and smiling beards were very different to the menacing media image of conservative Muslims. Amusingly, like other Indians we met, they struck a serious pose when we came to photograph them which, coupled with the fading sunlight, gave them a wholly undeserved sinister edge.</p> <p>Unlike the hustle and bustle of the ancient quarters of other Indian cities, Srinagar's old town is relatively peaceful. Its Sufi shrines and Sikh temples aside, the city's most intriguing architectural feature is its unique central mosque. Lacking minarets and featuring by ornate wooden ceilings, roofs and columns, the Jama Masjid conjured up images of China in my head and of the Vikings in my wife's.</p> <p>Despite the tranquillity of our surroundings, tension was never far below the surface. The Indian army and police were everywhere and the city lived by an unofficial curfew. At around 8.30 pm, all the shops would close and eateries would suddenly empty as people rushed for the shelter of their homes. Several locals told us that, although the official curfew was abolished, they do not stay out because they are still regularly hassled by the security services after dark.</p> <p>In fact, it seems the Indian army presence, which to the innocent outsider resembles a full-scale occupation force, is the subject of much resentment. We heard numerous complaints from locals about feeling constantly watched, and about the economic cost of the conflict. One told us that even many of the Kashmiris who were once happy to be a part of India have gone off the idea due to Indian heavy-handedness.</p> <p>As a reminder of the underlying volatility of the area, the army <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP96440.htm\">shut down</a> Srinagar and the entire Kashmir Valley to thwart a planned pro-independence rally. This left us wondering how it was that a country which prides itself on being the world's largest democracy could stifle free expression in such a massive way, especially as the <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PULITZER/383ab810ca7ce26eab8816f38354650a.htm\">wave of protests</a> which have swept the area since the summer have been peaceful ones, with the violence coming mainly from the army, causing the death of some <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12380885\">45 protesters</a> in the past few months. </p> <p>We suffered the minor inconvenience of not being able to enjoy a relaxing last morning on the houseboat we had rented, the rudeness of swaggering officers and the Catch-22 challenge of getting to the airport when we were allowed to move but nobody else was. </p> <p>The locals, however, were left to endure effective house arrest and a shoot-on-sight curfew. The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP348917.htm\">unwisely chose</a> this time to go and open Kashmir's first train line, triggering angry demonstrations.</p> <p>For the rest of our trip in India we monitored the country's English-language media to try to learn the latest about the situation in Kashmir. With the exception of one small paper called The Asian Age, we found no mention of the crackdown beyond a couple of news-in-brief items. With that kind of media blackout, it's little wonder than so many Indians believe the mess in Kashmir is solely Pakistan's fault.</p>",

Even though our media (this blogging internet) is newer than telly, for me there's something a bit reminiscent of listening to the football on the radio (something all chefs and cabbies and other noble professions have done a lot of) about our kitchen clickalong - it may be easier to watch the Great Scot to do it on the box (Friday, channel 4, 8pm) but as those of you out there who now know me, I LIKE doing things differently, and a bit more home-made and challenging too. Let's be honest, he's got it easy; whereas with our one YOU need to read, cook and refresh your page, and meanwhile I've got to cook, think in a creative, interesting and amusing way whilst helping you knock up your sups (with a little help from my missus with the typing)....and let's not forget that bottle of wine that needs some attention too. <br>So for tonight's supper I decided to do the Egyptian Aubergine and Tamarind Stew and a Pilaff, both from my new book LEON: Ingredients &amp; Recipes, which is indeed a DWM (Dish Without Meat ie Veggie, and please don't get facetious on me about the fish just now - I'm a bit off the word vegetarian as it turns lots of folk off instantly. Clearly this is nothing like a WMD, except... depending on your personal choice of chilli amounts, you could say both have the ability to go like a rocket). This was done firstly as I'm an inclusive kind of a girl and I didn't want anyone feeling left out, secondly it's bloody delicious (and I promise you won't be pining for bacon on the side) and thirdly as good citizens of this planet, you may have heard that we're all supposed to be eating a bit less meat. Just a bit.<br>So I'm going to be leaving you with your chopping now - I want all those obos chunked, peppers prepped and ingredients assembled before we all sing the national anthem and the ref blows his whistle for kick off: Chop Chop and see you at 8.<br>A x</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7:59pm:</strong> Hello and welcome to the first edition of McEvedy supper making. Hope you are all as excited as I am and with out further ado lets get on with it.</p> <p>Crank your oven up to 190 degrees C or just shy of 400 degrees F and if you did get hold of dried favas drain them, put them in new water and start simmering now.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>8:03pm:</strong> Get your lucky knife and give it a sharpen. Give your aubergine (mine weighs about 500g) a rinse. Cut off the green spiky top. Then cut it in half lengthways and each half in half again so you have 4 long quarters.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>8:06pm:</strong> What I like to do is, starting at the thin end, do ziggeddy cuts so that you have got fair sized chunks. Then once you get half way down the quarter split it lengthwise again and with 3 more chops you should end up with all similar sized pieces. Get it?? Then do the same with the other 3 quarters.</p> <p>None of this really matters too much you are basically just aiming for similar sized chunks for even cooking.</p> <!-- Block 6 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-356777078\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/1224702634148/Cut_your_aubergines.jpg\" alt=\"Aubergines oiled & on tray\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>8:10pm:</strong> Lightly oil a baking tray which is about the right size to hold your obo chunks. Sprinkle on some salt (sea salt is much nicer), splash on a bit more olive oil and now put them in your nice hot oven.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>8:13pm:</strong> Get a good heavy based pan (you know Le Creuset, mines about 25cm across) on a medium heat to warm through and meanwhile stick the kettle on - for stock not for tea.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8:15pm:</strong> Slice your onion. Chop your garlic (you can add more garlic if you fancy it) and for BiggestJim who left his garlic in the office, shame on you but can't you run and borrow a couple of cloves off a friendly neighbour.</p> <p>Put the olive oil in the pan, along with the onions and the garlic (there should be a satisfying sizzle and that familiar aroma we all love).</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8:18pm:</strong> Bollocks, forgot to say chuck the whole chilli in now too - I have got 2 going in but I am just like that.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8:19pm:</strong> Lower the heat a little bit now so they are still sizzling nicely but aren't in danger of catching and burning on the bottom.</p> <p>And now lets turn our attention to the pilaff.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8:21pm:</strong> Whilst not neglecting to stir your onions from time to time, put your currants, allspice, dill (washed), and spring onion into a bowl and give it a rough mix and shake. </p> <p>I've just given my onions a little move around too.</p> <p>Put a pan for the pilaff on a medium heat.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8:29pm:</strong> Sorry, small technological breakdown. </p> <p>Add the oil to the pilaff pan. Pour in the mix from the bowl - quick stir for a second - followed by the rice. Turn the heat right down and let it do the slow shuffle fry while you add your spices to the onions.</p> <!-- Block 13 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-356777079\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/1224703995318/Ingredients_into_the_pan.jpg\" alt=\"Ingredients into the pan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>8:32pm:</strong> Your pot should now look like this.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8:34pm:</strong> Now knock up your veg stock and pour onto the rice.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8:38pm:</strong> Bring your rice to a slow simmer and put a lid on. </p> <p>Tip your tomatoes into your spiced onions. Stir well and turn the heat up (technology let us down so we are going to speed up the stew a bit).</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8:39pm:</strong> Have a quick look at your aubergines in the oven. Give them a shuffle using a fish slice making sure you don't lose any nice brown bits on the bottom and put them back in again.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>8:41pm:</strong> Add some salt and pepper to your tomato base which should be bubbling away quite furiously by now and have a big slug of vino.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8:43pm:</strong> By now your tomatoes should be looking slightly more muted in colour and reduced. Stir in your pepper pieces, sweetness (fructose or a couple of tablespoons of honey/sugar) and tamarind (and to anyone who is using tamarind block take the seeds out first but you don't need to dissolve it).</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>8:46pm:</strong> Ok, now we're cooking: check your rice - it should be bubbling away nicely but still with quite a lot of liquid around the grains.

  "<p>Fed up of your wireless network? Tired of the fact that your PS3 can't seem to find your router through two walls and a radiator? You're not alone. PLC (or power line communication) adaptors utilise your home's electricity wiring to extend your broadband network and are increasing in popularity at an impressive rate. According to the <a href=\"http://www.homeplug.org/home\">Homeplug Powerline Alliance</a>, 16 million units were sold last year, eight million more than 2006 - and numbers are set to rise again this year. </p> <p>I have to admit, I knew little about the technology before I put my Xbox 360 and PS3 in the attic room a couple of months ago and found that the wireless signal from the router in my living room was degrading by something like 70%. A fellow journalist suggested PLC, so I contacted D-Link and asked to borrow a couple of their <a href=\"http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=561\">DHP-300s</a>, a 200Mbps adaptor promising complete plug-and-play performance. </p> <p>Which turned out to be accurate. I plugged one in to the mains socket near my router, connected it via an Ethernet cable, then slapped the other one in the socket two floors up, using another Ethernet cable to hook up my consoles. The two adapters found each other within about 20 seconds, and the result has been reliable, Ethernet-quality broadband access, with a huge reduction in latency. At around \u00a390 for a pack of two adaptors it's not cheap, but it meant I didn't have to install a wireless booster on the first floor, or attempt to lay an Ethernet cable between my attic and my living room. </p> <p>So is there anything newcomers should know about this technology? Well, yes, lots \u2013 some good, some bad. Here are eight key points to bear in mind\u2026<br><br><strong>Maintaining standards</strong><br>Ah, format wars \u2013 aren't they just the best part of consumer electronics? Turns out, there are two types of PLC product: Powerline, supported by the <a href=\"http://www.upaplc.org\">Univeral Powerline Association</a> and featuring a chipset manufactured by <a href=\"http://www.ds2.es/\">DS2</a>, and HomePlug, supported by the HomePlug Powerline Alliance and built around a chipset by <a href=\"http://www.intellon.com/\">Intellon</a>. These, naturally, are not compatible.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/portal/site\">IEEE</a> is attempting to ratify a single standard for PLC products, with the HPA and UPA in competition to provide the specifications. Unfortunately, at a recent meeting in Madrid, the IEEE proposal failed to garner enough votes for the standard to be put in place. On top of that, the <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/jca/hn/index.phtml\">International Telecommunications Union </a> G.hn group is attempting to drum up support for a rival standard, which places greater emphasis on interoperability and according to Andrew Mulholland, Marketing Manager for D-Link UK and Ireland, has more backing from the industry.</p> <p>You can read more <a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210605077\">here</a>.</p> <p>This doesn't mean much at the moment, but a single technological standard could make PLC technology more understandable and accessible to consumers, and may lead to overall improvements in performance. Either that or you'll discover you backed the wrong horse in the format war and your adaptors are now obsolete\u2026.</p> <p><strong>Speed counts?</strong><br>PLC adaptors tend to come in two flavours - 85mbps and 200mbps. There's some disagreement on whether you need to opt for the faster solution for gaming, though I know several tech journalists who say they get by just fine with 85mbps. It's when you're shifting HD video content around your house that you may want to upscale. As Andrew Ferguson of <a href=\"http://www.thinkbroadband.com/\">Thinkbroadband</a> confirms, \"The AV (200Mbps) units are needed if you are going to be using fast broadband in the 20Mbps to 50Mbps region, or are perhaps streaming HD video (20-30Mbps) from a home media server.\"</p> <p><strong>Distance still matters</strong><br>\"HomePlug units are range dependent, so in large houses the speeds experienced will vary,\" says Ferguson. \"From second to ground floor should be achievable normally - but I've found the AV (200Mbps) units to have a better range\". </p> <p><strong>Go for a pure connection</strong><br>Always put the adaptor straight into the wall rather than an extension socket \u2013 that'll cause 'noise' which effects speed. However, D-Link reckon new adapters can cope with crowded sockets and extensions thanks to their modulation and error recovery mechanisms.</p> <p><strong>It's more secure than wireless, but not completely secure\u2026</strong><br>There's a possibility that you may share electricity circuitry with a neighbour, so in theory, if they plug a compatible PLC adaptor into a socket, they could hitch a ride on your broadband network. However, most units come with software that lets you secure your network, granting access only to properly configured adaptors \u2013 i.e. your own. </p> <p><strong>Interfering with people</strong><br>When I asked Andrew Ferguson if there are any disadvantages to the technology, he simply replied, \"talk to radio hams\u2026\" So I did. It turns out PLC adaptors produce RF interference, which may knock out shortwave radio reception within the immediate vicinity. Radio hams aren't happy, viewing this technology an indiscriminate and clumsy airwave pollutant. There are pressure groups dedicated to securing legislation against PLC - I contacted one named <a href=\"http://mikeandsniffy.co.uk/UKQRM/\">UKQRM</a>, which has produced YouTube videos (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S__UBDaL-aE\">here</a>'s one, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAzUtN29h1A\">here</a>'s another) purporting to show the interference in action. Elsewhere, the <a href=\"http://www.rsgb.org/\">Radio Society of Great Britain</a> is pressuring OFCOM to take action.</p> <p>I asked Andrew Mulholland for a comment. He told me:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"PLC devices inject very low power into the electricity lines to avoid having interference to radio services. Additionally all D-Link devices based on <a href=\"http://www.ds2.es/home.aspx \">DS2 technology</a> have all the <a href=\"http://www.iaru.org/\">IARU</a> frequencies notched out, with an average attenuation of 40dB each. This enables the devices to be radio friendly. Furthermore, the DS2 chipset has been tested and subsequently demonstrated to Radio Amateur associations <a href=\"http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2006/03/22/1/?nc=1\">such as ARRL in the US</a>.</p> <p>\"Additionally to this, D-Link PowerLine products based on DS2 technology have the capability to add any other notch should the need arise, providing a completely programmable and flexible way to solve any interference regardless of the frequency. This is a unique feature that allows these devices to be 100% radio friendly.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I also had a chat with Jonathan Lishawa, the managing director of Comtrend, which provides Powerline adaptors for use with the BT Vision service. He assured me the company is working closely with OFCOM and BT to overcome any interference issues. \"We had to answer lots of questions from BT, we had to go through exhaustive field trials, and we had to conform to all the EMC certifcation, as well <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS_1363\">BS1363</a> parts 1,2,3. I can't stress this enough, we'd like to engage with the Radio Society, but in a constructive manner. It is a concern, but we believe we've addressed and continue to address that concern\".</p> <p>This does, however, remain a complex area with several ambiguities and uncertainties. From anecdotal evidence it seems there <em>are</em> products available that interfere with shortwave frequencies, not just amateur bands but with radio stations like the BBC World Service. I have been contacted by an ex-BBC transmissions engineer who claims to have investigated dozens of interference problems reported by radio listeners, and has been personally affected, bringing in OFCOM to remove a neighbour's PLC adapter due to 'spectrum abuse'. </p> <p>While PLC adapters may allow the 'notching out' of affected frequencies, it looks like it's up to individual users to ensure they're not blocking radio reception for all their neighbours\u2026<br> <br><strong>Interfering with your keyboard</strong><br>On a more local level, there have been instances of Comtrend Powerline adaptors interfering with wireless keyboards and mice. You'll find references to the problem <a href=\"http://beta.bt.com/bta/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=39342\">here</a>, as well as some BT tech support suggestions on how to deal with it.</p> <p>\"To put this into perspective we've shipped into the UK over half a million pairs of adaptors, and we've had 20 customers who've had interference issues \u2013 and we've managed to resolve all of those,\" says Lishawa, who adds that the solution is often to 'notch out' or block the offending frequencies via the adapter.</p> <p><strong>Interfering with your fridge</strong><br>There's also a possibility that household appliances can interfere with PLC technologies, but modern adaptors are designed to cope with this. As Mulholland states:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Despite PLC technology using OFDM modulation with FEC error recovery mechanisms, the powerline channel originally was not designed to be a clean communication medium like coaxial and there are some house appliances that could introduce some noise into the channel that vary its conditions along the time (Signal to Noise ratio). These variations are handled by the technology adapting its modulation schemes to transmit the data without losses and this can produce slight changes in the performance during the day, although continuous SW and HW enhancements are introduced into the adapters to minimize its effects in the speed and in their general performance\". </p> </blockquote> <p>Get that?</p>",

  "<p>After being treated as political kryptonite and depicted as enraged Orcs for the past seven years, Muslims and Arabs \u2013 the media's modern day Morlocks \u2013 temporarily emerged as human beings thanks to Colin Powell's Obama endorsement on Sunday.</p> <p>The former US secretary of state partially redeemed his tarnished legacy by <a href=\" http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27265369/\">asking</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>What if [Obama] is [a Muslim]? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer is: No, that's not America. Is there something wrong with some seven-year-old Muslim-American kid believing he or she can be president?</p> <p>Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion: he's a Muslim, and he might be associated with terrorists. This is not the way we should be doing it in America.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, according to an increasingly vocal, racist and Islamophobic minority, which has been shamefully aided over the years by the inexcusable silence of a complicit mainstream media, there is something fundamentally \"un-American\" about wearing the contemporary Scarlet Letter: Muslim.</p> <p>The October surprise unleashed by a desperate Republican campaign \u2013 spearheaded by mavericks John McCain and Sarah Palin \u2013 reeks from the stench of a modern day, fear-mongering McCarthyism - replacing Communism with Islam.</p> <p>Obama, that biracial, African American son of a Kenyan with an Arab name, is apparently now a \"Socialist with Islamic background\" according to anti-Muslim McCain supporters at a now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_SKyKOih7k\"> infamous McCain Virginia rally</a>. When asked to prove such an audacious claim, the rabble rouser replied: \"Well, he was raised in a madrassa [an Indonesian elementary school] \u2026there's a lot of background ... I can't do that [intelligently explain my ignorant prejudice] right now.\"</p> <p>Perhaps he received his cues from McCain and Governor Palin. Although Colin Powell swears McCain is no racist, the media conveniently forgets his obscene and unapologetic 2000 statement: \"I hate the Gooks. I will hate them as long as I live.\" Thankfully, the Vietnamese Americans at <a href=\"http://mccainhatesgooks.com/mchg/\"> McCainHatesGooks.com</a> have not. </p> <p>Therefore, is it truly surprising that McCain's running mate, Troopergate Palin, recently cast doubt on Obama's \"past\" due to his associations with Reverend Wright, his \"terrorist pal\" William Ayers, and <a href=\" http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/20/campaign.wrap/\">most recently in a speech</a> where she compared Obama to a socialist: \"Barack Obama calls it spreading the wealth \u2026 But Joe the Plumber and Ed the Dairy Man, I believe that they think that it sounds more like socialism.\" </p> <p>According to Sarah the Moose Hunter and her acolytes, such as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1008/Limbaugh_Where_are_the_inexperienced_white_liberals_Powell_has_endorsed.html?showall\">Rush the Blowhard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/16/stephen-baldwin-obama-a-c_n_135394.html\">Stephen the Untalented Baldwin</a>, Obama's Arabic name and non-existent Islamic roots emit threatening \"un-American\" and \"terrorist-y\" vibes.</p> <p>In contrast, however, Powell's surprisingly tolerant words, which he should have uttered in 2003 in lieu of his shameful UN security council \"anthrax in a vial\" speech, reflect a growing Republican self-awareness of previously unchecked \"smear by Muslim association\" rhetoric. In fact, at the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl2EndLZv7w\">same Virginia McCain rally</a>, several Conservative Christian and Muslim McCain voters chastised the \"Obama is a Muslim\" inciter as racist and unrepresentative of their beliefs.</p> <p>One wonders what took an influential American personality, such as Powell, so long to make such elementary and rational statements regarding Muslim and Arab Americans. <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/13/campbell.brown.obama/\">CNN's Campbell Brown</a> should be commended as being one of the first vocal members of the mainstream media to ask, \"Even if Obama is a Muslim \u2013 so what?\" Even actor Ben Affleck deserves applause for reminding the world on Real Time with Bill Maher that \"Arab and 'good person' are not antithetical to one another.\" </p> <p>The next evolutionary step, of course, will be \"He's Muslim \u2013 not that there's anything wrong with that.\" Followed, hopefully, by \"Why, some of my best friends are Muslim!\"</p> <p>Eventually, it will culminate with a blindingly obvious realisation that indeed Muslims \u2013 like every other group \u2013 are patriotic American citizens, just like the 20-year-old specialist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/2008/09/29/slideshow_080929_platon?slide=16\">Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan</a> mentioned in Powell's speech. Sultan, a Muslim American native of Manahawkin, New Jersey, and the recipient of the prestigious Purple Heart and Bronze Star, now rests in Arlington Cemetery after giving his life to protect and serve his country in Iraq.</p> <p>Shahed Amanullah, the editor of Altmuslim.com, <a href=\" http://blog.beliefnet.com/progressiverevival/2008/10/crescents-among-the-crosses.html \">reminds us</a> that \"according to the American Muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council, there are currently 20,000 Muslims serving with honor in the US military.\" </p> <p>Furthermore, it warrants mentioning that in 2007, the Washington DC Muslim community honored the Muslim American Veteran's Association, which was represented by Muslim soldiers who bravely fought for the US alongside their fellow American soldiers in the second world war.</p> <p>Yet, these sobering reminders of our communality are constantly drowned in a sea of divisive hate speech. Surprisingly, no one has asked: \"What do Muslim, African and Arab countries think of the anti-Obama smear campaign?\" After all, if McCain wins a major reason will be due to his campaign's use of racist and prejudicial fear mongering, as evidenced by the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/obama-mccain-election-ohio-carolina\">McCain-endorsed robocalls</a>. </p> <p>What does this rhetoric say about America, and what signal does that send to the rest of the world? In the 21st century, is the self-proclaimed beacon of democracy and defender of liberties comprised of a hypocritical and ignorant voting populace so terrified of a \"minority\" that we vote for the alternative simply due to his \"whiteness,\" which inherently affirms his professed \"American-ness?\" If indeed McCain is a maverick, reformer and a \"uniter\" unlike George Bush, how will he explain his campaign rhetoric and smearing tactics to Muslim allies, such as Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan, as we combine efforts on the \"War on Terror?\" Due to this overwhelming hysteria, are we shocked to learn that according to a comprehensive world Gallup poll - highlighted in the inestimable <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/press/17473/gallup-press.aspx\">Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think</a> - when Americans were asked, \"What do you admire about Muslims?\" a majority answered, \"I don't know\" or \"Nothing.\"</p> <p>When the US had the honour of hosting the 1996 Olympics, the pantheon of athletic talent and sportsmanship, Americans reflected a different mentality. The motto of the Olympic Games is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sadly, the Republicans have lost sight of this sentiment. However, in Atlanta 12 years ago the US - which includes Republicans, Democrats and independents - took pride in bestowing the honour of lighting the Olympic flame to a national symbol of strength and defiance. He has an Arab name. He is Muhammad Ali. </p> <p>He is an American. And a Muslim.</p>",
  "<p>Newspaper distribution will continue to be protected by an opt-out from competition law under guidance handed down today by the Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>However, the regulator said magazine distribution could work better if there were greater competition among wholesalers.</p> <p>In its latest report in a long-running investigation, the OFT also said it had reviewed the 14-year-old national newspapers code of practice and believed some restrictions on wholesalers should be eased.</p> <p>The fate of the code is now in the hands of the new business secretary, Lord Mandelson.</p> <p>And the OFT said it was minded to reject calls from independent retailers to refer the newspaper and magazine supply system to the Competition Commission.</p> <p>The OFT added that it preferred to exercise its discretion not to make such a referral and would hold a consultation on this before making a final decision next year. </p> <p>At the moment the UK's wholesalers enjoy \"absolute territorial protection\" - ATP - to distribute newspapers and magazines, which means they get exclusive access to specific areas of the country, and retailers stocking newspapers and magazines cannot choose between different wholesalers. </p> <p>The OFT said this system could be justified in the case of newspapers, because their time-sensitivity as daily publications required rapid and efficient delivery. </p> <p>However, it said magazine sales were not subject to this same pressure, meaning that there was \"greater scope\" for competition between wholesalers. </p> <p>The OFT is now leaving it to publishers, distributors and wholesalers to decide whether the current regime is compliant with competition law.</p> <p>John Fingleton, the OFT chief executive, said the watchdog had conducted \"the most detailed and thorough analysis of the sector done in recent years\". </p> <p>\"We are recommending a release from regulatory restrictions, while the industry should now take a close look at its own arrangements,\" he added.<br> \"We hope that once it has done this, our work in this important sector will enable competition to deliver even better outcomes.\"</p> <p>The PPA, the publishers' industry trade body, welcomed the OFT's protection for newspapers but said some magazines were time-sensitive too.</p> <p>\"What is missing from the opinion is a full appreciation by the OFT of the value and volume of the highly time-sensitive magazines, including TV listings magazines, classified magazines, celebrity magazines and the many weekly news and women's interests titles,\" said the PPA chief executive, Jonathan Shephard. </p> <p>\"Together, these make up a high proportion of total magazine volumes and values, running at more than half a billion copies each year.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

With no phone and no car, he would be the first to admit he doesn't own much. </p> <p>But what little he does have, he nearly lost earlier this year after he fell of a ladder while he was painting and went to the local hospital to get a herniated disc treated. Crimmins was left with a $5,000 bill; he earns $15,000. </p> <p>When he was taken to court for the money, he didn't bother showing up. \"I didn't see the point,\" he says. \"They're going to do whatever they want anyhow.\" </p> <p>So Carilion, a nonprofit private clinic that gets tax breaks in return for a commitment to provide healthcare to the poor, garnished his wages. They are also garnishing his sister's wages for money she owes them and extracting money from his mother's pay packet for care she received. \"Carilion have been trying to take me to court since I was 18,\" says Crimmins. </p> <p>Indeed, since 2003 Carilion has accounted for 40% of all the judgments at Roanoke district court. Such is the volume of its collections that the courts set aside one day a week just to deal with healthcare. They call it Carilion day.</p> <p>\"While the numbers seem large, they represent a small fraction of the 2 million patient visits to Carilion facilities each year,\" says Eric Earnhart, a spokesman for Carilion.\"</p> <p>\"But we are working hard to reduce the number of people who qualify for charity care but do not pursue it. Last year we provided approximately $43m in free care to patients who couldn't afford to pay.\"</p> <p>A local group, the Citizens Coalition for Responsible Healthcare, has been set up to challenge Carilion and raise the issue of affordable healthcare in the town.</p> <p>Ken King, the coalition president, says that if you cannot afford health insurance, \"your doctor of choice becomes the emergency room\". </p> <p>\"At that point you are probably walking into a room that has the highest cost of operation of any medical facility, any kind of care available ... If you can't pay it, you get sued. Thirty-three thousand people in Roanoke general district court in the last five years have been sued for that bill.\"</p> <p>Once a railroad town, Roanoke is now dominated by Carilion, which merged with another local hospital in the late 1980s. At the time, the justice department tried and failed to prevent the merger, warning that it would create a monopoly. </p> <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, health insurance rates in the area have risen since then from the lowest to the highest in Virginia. </p> <p>Carilion disputes this: \"A comparison of Carilion's prices with hospitals that have comparable volume, and with the state average, shows that in many if not most cases, our prices are lower,\" it says. </p> <p>Today, a colonoscopy at Carilion costs between four and 10 times what you would pay at a local endoscopy centre, while a neck CT scan is just under three times as much. Hospital care, Carilion says, is always more expensive than that provided at outpatient facilities.</p> <p>The hospital has a charity care programme through which anyone who earns twice the federal poverty level or less should pay less, or nothing. A single person earning less than $20,800 or a family of four with an income below $42,400 should qualify. Clearly, however, many fall between the cracks.<br>So Crimmins, it turned out, was eligible for assistance, and Carilion has stopped pursuing him. </p> <p>Healthcare has emerged as a huge issue in this election. With the provision of care here often tied to jobs, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\">failing economy</a> means anyone worried about their job security is, almost by definition, worried about their health. </p> <p>And this isn't just a concern for the very poor. One small business owner and cancer survivor I spoke to says she has not been for her check-ups for three years because she has no health insurance. She simply makes it a priority not to get sick. </p> <p>With 16% of the country uninsured, and 50% of bankruptcies linked to non-payment of medical bills, the issue is central to the economy.</p> <p>The numbers are staggering. \"Forty-seven million [people] - which is 35% of the population - don't have healthcare insurance in the United States right now,\" says King. \"$143bn is the administrative cost of the healthcare system, and that's simply the paperwork cost; $2tn is the annual healthcare cost in the United States ... and $7,000 per person is what it costs us. </p> <p>\"One of the things that is really a problem is that employers are beginning to say: 'We can no longer do this. We can't provide healthcare for you as an employee.' And that number is going to go way up.\"</p> <p>For the most part, that is good news for the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, who is regarded as better on health than his Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. </p> <p>\"Me, personally, I think I would put a poor man in, somebody who knows how to budget, knows how it feels to struggle,\" Crimmins says. \"[I've worked] pretty much since I was 12 years old. My mom, she was raising nine of us by herself, so she didn't have the money to get what we wanted - or what we needed, most of the time. So I always had to pitch in and help out.\"</p> <p>He has never voted, and he is not registered. But he is rooting for McCain because, he says, the Republican is more experienced. </p> <p>If she were registered, his partner, Melissa Hicks, would vote the same way. \"I don't know why I don't like Obama,\" she says. \"But it's not because he's black.\"</p>",

  "<p>Thailand's new prime minister had to flee an angry mob for the second time in a fortnight today when he was cornered in an underground car park.</p> <p>A crowd of about 200 jeering government workers pelted Somchai Wongsawat with plastic water bottles and shoes as he visited the information ministry in Bangkok.</p> <p>Bodyguards and security staff shielded Somchai and bustled him into a waiting car. They were apparently caught out by the ferocity of the protest despite having to deal with violent anti-government protests that have paralysed the capital for months.</p> <p>Somchai later tried to downplay it as a \"colourful\" incident, saying: \"It was not a serious protest.\"</p> <p>Two weeks ago Somchai had to crawl under a barbed wire fence before he was flown to safety in an army helicopter when anti-government protesters laid siege to parliament.</p> <p>The demonstrators are demanding he quit over the violent police crackdown against them. They have been backed by the Thai army chief, Anupong Paochinda.</p> <p>The protesters accuse Somchai of being a puppet of his brother-in-law, the ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinatra, who has been sentenced in his absence to two years in jail over a land deal.</p> <p>The rally today was by staff from the state telecoms operator inside the grounds of the information ministry.</p> <p>The prime minister's car dodged the crowd screaming \"Somchai, murderer\" and drove into an underground car park. But the mob surged around him waving noisy plastic hand-clappers.</p> <p>Somchai slipped into the building but emerged through the front entrance, apparently in an effort to talk to the demonstrators. But the mob threw clappers, bottles and shoes at the prime minister and his entourage.</p> <p>Hurling shoes is deeply insulting in Thai culture because the feet are considered the dirtiest part of the body.</p>",
  "<p>Taxes on draught beer in pubs should be cut to help save \"the local\" from extinction in many rural and suburban areas, MPs said today.</p> <p>They called on the government to consider different levies on beer served from a pump to those on bottled or canned beer to protect such \"national icons\".</p> <p>They hope this can combat what they see as an unfair advantage enjoyed by supermarkets, which could absorb tax rises in a way publicans on slender margins could not. Legally enforceable minimum prices for beer might be a long-term alternative, they said.</p> <p>A panel of the 400-member all-party parliamentary beer group claimed that the ability of big stores to offer beer or lager for as little as 90p for four cans - while a pint in a pub often costs drinkers seven times as much - would lead to a decline of the pub as a social centre where drinking could be controlled. </p> <p>Taxes on beer at present accounted for a third of the price. MPs said these were often absorbed by supermarkets. </p> <p>The tax changes were part of a package that included higher stake and prize-money limits for pub gambling machines, reduced business rates in return for their social role, simpler planning rules for pubs wanting to diversify, and easier licensing laws.</p> <p>The group receives office funding from 60 companies in the industry. Its panel's report, which follows a two-year inquiry, accused ministers of not paying sufficient attention to the role the local played in the social fabric. </p> <p>With pubs closing down at the \"astonishing rate\" of 36 a week, the report said communities risked losing a hub that provided local employment and sports sponsorship, bought local food, raised an average of \u00a33,300 a year for good causes and hosted services ranging from post offices, lunch clubs and shops to MPs' surgeries.</p> <p>\"This side of the pub trade has been largely overlooked in media coverage of licensing hours, law and order and binge drinking, and other problems more typically associated with large town centre pubs and bars... action taken in response to problems with perhaps 5 or 10% of the trade have caused further problems for the other 90 or 95%.\" </p> <p>Ministers should consider whether changes in tax regimes could \"reverse the trend away from drinking in public places or getting 'tanked up' at home before a night out, and back into the regulated environment of the pub.\"</p> <p>Nigel Evans, the Conservative MP for Ribble Valley and co-chair of the inquiry, said: \"We cannot sit back and let these gems disappear. They are the heart of the community. It is where all community life in some rural areas takes place.\"</p> <p>Janet Dean, the Labour MP for Burton and Uttoxeter, his fellow co-chair, said: \"There are some extraordinarily committed licensees out there, delivering a remarkable array of activities, but they are labouring against the twin evils of cheap supermarket beer and a regulatory backlash from government seeking to curb alcohol disorder problems not of their making.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the UK's higher education sector becomes ever more competitive, one wouldn't have thought that a university \u2013 especially not a relatively new one, such as <a href=\"http://www.glyndwr.ac.uk/\">Glyndwr University</a> in Wrexham \u2013 would be cavalier enough to discourage any potential student from applying for a course. </p> <p>But this appears to be what happened when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/7673675.stm\">Odgerel Hatenboer</a> tried to apply for an accountancy course at Glyndwr. Moreover, the staff member in question is alleged to have said something along the lines of:</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm not saying you're Chinese but people like you, Oriental people, tend to accept what is written in the books and what the lecturer says, whereas this kind of course is nothing like you have studied in the past, it requires more analytical skills, you will have to do more yourself.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaving aside the highly unfashionable use of the adjective \"Oriental\", this was clearly unacceptable; Mrs Hatenboer (who was born in Mongolia, and already holds a masters degree) was discouraged from applying on the basis of her ethnic background. Delving beneath the crassness, though, there's a germ of uncomfortable truth that British universities would be advised to acknowledge.</p> <p>The philosophy of education in many east Asian countries is fundamentally different from the western model. Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian cultures prioritise harmony and hierarchy over discursive analysis and informed debate. Not only is it taboo to question the views of the teacher; I have friends who never dared to ask a factual question in all their time at Asian universities. To do so would be to suggest that a teacher had missed something out, thus raising doubts about professorial authority. Even in many postgraduate courses, there is a meek acceptance of top-down, test-fuelled teaching that makes even Britain's exam-obsessed education policy look like a model of free thinking.</p> <p>But these differences may go deeper than mere education. Psychologists such as <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/news/Releases/2003/Feb03/r022703a.html\">Richard Nisbett</a> have suggested that basic cognition and understanding may be fundamentally different in people brought up in an Asian culture, from those raised under the influence of classical and Judeo-Christian thinking. And to dismiss such theories with a knee-jerk accusation of racism is to miss the point: Nisbett specifically rejects the poisonous genetic determinism of the <a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/bellcurve.shtml\">Bell Curve</a> cabal. The difference is deep-seated, but it's nurture, not nature.</p> <p>Odgerel Hatenboer was treated badly; but a university sector desperate to accept as many lucrative international students as possible should be aware that some newcomers may need to undergo some pretty profound unlearning before they can fully benefit from the British education system. To accept that is not racist. It is simply to face the fundamental paradox of multiculturalism: how can we respect cultural differences if we aren't permitted to acknowledge that those differences exist?</p>",
  "<p>There's an unwritten rule when it comes to playing iconic characters: stick to one at a time. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/seanconnery\">Sean Connery</a> understood it (at least in his classic years as 007), Christopher Reeve got it, and so, it seems, does <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danielcraig\">Daniel Craig</a>. <a href=\"http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5627&amp;Itemid=99\">According to Iesb.com</a>, the blond Bond was offered the role of Thor in Marvel's forthcoming adaptation of the adventures of the Norse god, and turned it down, reportedly stating that the dual roles would have been \"too much of a power trip\".</p> <p>The thought of having one actor playing both 007 and the son of Odin isn't the only reason why I think Craig made the right choice here. <a href=\"http://www.hecklerspray.com/kenneth-branagh-wants-to-direct-thor/200816385.php\">Thor looks set to be directed by Kenneth Branagh</a>, whose involvement immediately implies something more highbrow, but I'm struggling to see how the finished product can possibly end up being anything other than high camp. It seems to me that the respected directors who are currently signing on in their droves to bring comic book characters to the big screen have most likely been influenced by Christopher Nolan's successful attempt to excise every last gram of cheese from the Batman franchise. The problem is that Batman is an inherently more complex character, with enormous potential for pseudo-psychological analysis. I even have a book sitting, admittedly unread, next to my bed titled Batman and Philosophy, which attempts to explain many of the essential tenets of western and eastern thinking through the filter of Bruce Wayne's alter ego. </p> <p>Thor, on the other hand, is a bloody great viking who looks like a participant in a professional wrestling contest. Craig, who has worked so hard to rebuild audiences' belief in 007 as an inhabitant of the real world, would have been a laughing stock. The only similar successful figure in celluloid is Robert E Howard's Conan, the subject of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/\">John Milius's bravura 1982 epic fantasy</a> starring a perfectly cast Arnold Schwarzenegger, and one abominably cheesy sequel. But the difference is that Conan didn't have to visit the modern day real world. Thor is going to suffer hugely from what I like to call the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=D5FpADrNcNI\">Hercules in New York</a> syndrome: dress him in jeans and he looks stupid, keep him in his original garb and, well, he still looks pretty damn stupid. </p> <p>Besides, I met Craig recently and despite the buffness he's not a particularly big man in real life; I'd say he's at least six inches too short to play a Norse god. Who do you think <em>would</em> make a good Thor?</p> <p>The not-more-than-one icon rule (catchy, eh?) is the reason why I'm more than a little concerned about Christian Bale's decision to take on the role of John Connor in (shudder) <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/\">McG's Terminator: Salvation</a>. For me, when an actor takes on parts which aren't worthy of them, or just plain wrong, it ruins my enjoyment of their performances in other films, and I really want to see more of Christian Bale as Batman. </p> <p>A good example of an actor breaking this rule is Samuel L Jackson. Thanks to roles in Snakes on a Plane and the Star Wars prequels, he has become a ridiculous caricature of himself. That obscenely charismatic turn as Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction has almost haunted him; people now expect larger-than-life acting from his films, and with a few exceptions, that's exactly what they get.</p> <p>Still, Jackson could be good value as Nick Fury, <a href=\"http://reelsuave.com/2008/10/20/nick-fury-to-be-in-iron-man-2/\">a role he confirmed earlier this week</a>, in the forthcoming Iron Man 2. Those who've seen Jon Favreau's summer superhero blockbuster may remember the post credits scene in which Jackson appears as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D, a mysterious organisation aimed at fighting the world's nefarious forces. Marvel comics has already remoulded Fury to fit Jackson's appearance and personality, and the actor will no doubt get off on playing a character who is effectively immortal and has been at one time or another, a second world war colonel, a suave 60s super-spy and modern day defeater of alien invaders. The fan-boys seem to have forgiven the actor for the whole purple lightsabre debacle: hopefully the Iron Man sequel will give him enough of a part that he can remind us why he was such a fascinating screen presence in the first place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, following on from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/oct/14/incredible-hulk-marvel-comics-iron-man\">last week's discussion about the future of the Hulk in movies</a> (thanks for all your comments, by the way), Marvel top dog Kevin Feige has confirmed that the not-so-jolly green giant <a href=\"http://www.cinematical.com/2008/10/21/hulk-will-return-and-doctor-strange-will-go-solo/\">does figure in the studio's future plans</a>, although it might be a while before he gets his own outing again. </p> <p>\"The truth is that Hulk has had two films in the past five years, and it's time to give some of the other guys a turn,\" Feige told MTV News. \"But certainly what we are doing is suggesting and cross-pollinating the characters between films, and, like reading a comic, I'd like to set that expectation that anything can happen - and anyone can pop up - in anybody else's story. I would expect that people may see the Hulk again soon before he is again carrying his own film.\"</p> <p>This implies that the Hulk could, as predicted in this column, end up in the forthcoming Avengers movie, which will likely unite Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. Where that leaves Ed Norton is anybody's guess. Feige also said that Marvel were considering bringing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange\">Doctor Strange</a> to the big screen, a quite intriguing prospect. The character isn't among the comic book publisher's best known, but that could work in its favour. Strange is a sorceror who, in his most recent incarnation, serves chiefly as a supporting character that superheroes often turn to for matters concerning the supernatural. </p> <p>The fact that Strange's name is coming up at all suggests that Marvel, which, lest we forget, has only produced two films so far, is thinking beyond its current roster of Iron Man 2, Thor, The Avengers and Ant Man, which alone should take the studio up until at least 2011. That's all very well, but I hope the quality control remains high: just as actors can take on too many roles, studios can take on too many projects. These films need to be great movies, not just great comic book movies, if they are to appeal beyond fan-boy circles, as the Dark Knight and Iron Man did this summer. Perhaps Marvel should follow Craig's lead, and take things one at a time too.</p>",

Now it looks like a non-contest between the champions-elect and a shower in all but name. The book may tell us different, but the cover says Chelsea Plenty Roma 0.</p> <p>Chelsea have been utterly majestic so far this season, whether with first team or second (tonight it's a mix, with seven of the best XI plus Bridge, Mikel, Kalou and Anelka).

It's all a bit confusing, as I have the Liverpool commentary and distant Chelsea pictures. But Chelsea are going from left to right and are, at the moment, poodling about at the back.</p> <p>\"I'm assuming,\" begins Neill Brown, \"that Scolari's presented John Terry with that lovely crystal receptacle should the Chelsea captain get caught short in a [SNIP \u2013 legal team] again?\" An episode of Only Fools and Horses? Eh?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>I forgot someone very important, someone absolutely central to the popularity (sic) of theguardian.com/sport, in those ackowledgements</strong> Gary Naylor, I hope you can forgive me.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> \"This week on the UK Penguin Press Office bulletin\u2026\" says Penguin Press. That's about the standard so far, both here and at Stamford Bridge: Chelsea are playing keepball in safe areas.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> In attempting to fix my feed, the Powers That Effeverythingup have now killed the Liverpool feed as well, replacing it with the dating channel and now Cilla Black. Anyway, not much is happening at Stamford Bridge, although that's much more than's going on at the Vicente Calderon.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> The Champions League action has been replaced by the Body Balance channel - seriously - on which there is currently some octagenarian Worzel Gummidge lookalike preaching about the joys of using Marmite as a skin moisturiser, or some such. </p> <p>On that subject: \"Is Totti a European Riquelme - the world's two most Marmitey midfielders?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"Their fans really rate them, but their detractors (like me) feel they would best serve their teams by picking up a quick red card and getting out of the way to let the other ten get on with it.\" It's odd, because while Sean Ingle, for example, slates Riquelme and loves Totti (honk etc), I'm kind of the other way round, although I went off Riquelme a little after that hideously inevitable penalty miss against Arsenal. I certainly think Totti is a bit of a chancer.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> It's hard to discern, but there appears to be little going on at Chewlsea: D2-D4, E7-E5 and so on. Not even a challenging, let's-have-some G8-F6. </p> <p>\"The feed is disrupted by Gene Hackman, who uses his military skills as part of his communications attack strategy. Satellites are going down all over the boot,\" says Patrick Sullivan. \"See what you started?\" Don't blame me: it was someone, I forgot who, on that list of acknowledgements who set this MBM up.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> I'm sorry.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> We've now switched our one, distant feed to Liverpool, who have scored. Barcelona, meanwhile, are already 2-0 up in Basle and, according to Paul Walsh on AN Other Champions League Info Provider, are tearing the home side a new one.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> \"If this is all MBM can give us (see minute 17),\" says Patrick Sullivan, \"the Guardian owes all five of us online a bottle of Hendricks.\" If I don't get home to a day's supply of Laphroaig by way of compensation for this shambles, there will be blood.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Barcelona are 3-0 up. At Stamford Bridge, Mikel is taken down 25 yards out, slightly left of centre. Deco touches it off to Lampard, who wallops it off the outside of the left post. Cracking strike.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Chelsea continue to dominate possession but without <em>that</em> much in terms of penetration: Doni hasn't really made a save yet. But, while they were never quite as dull as the jealous masses liked to make out in the Mourinho years, there is no doubt they have gone up a couple of levels aesthetically, and they are playing some enjoyably rhythmic stuff.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>27 min</strong> \"Youre a hideous joke of a free service,\" says P Quigley, and even though I'd normally berate him for the missing apostrophe, I find myself unable to argue. \"Start making stuff up please. Athletico 6 - LFC 2. Roma defender breaks Lampards leg.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Kalou zips infield from the right corner of the box to work Doni with his left foot. It was a rudimentary save.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Roma have clearly come for a 0-0, with their 4-6-0 system more a 4-6-0-0. Terry and Carvalho are basically marking each other. But Chelsea, while moving the ball well enough, seem scared to overcommit, as if to do so would be to lean into a well-disguised haymaker with a neon 'HIT ME' sign on their jaw. I'm not sure Roma have anything like that in their locker.</p> <p>Malouda is booked for an unspecified offence, possibly his collective performance last season.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> \"I'm sitting alone in the uni library in Liverpool,\" says Elliott Murphy, mistaking this for Samaritans Online. \"Can't go to the pub cos i'm a Chelsea fan. You guys have let me down! Next time you're up to see a game at Anfield or Goodison, you're gonna have to up the cash you give me for looking after your car!\" He said it. Don't shoot the increasingly hapless messenger.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> A trademark, last-ditch challenge from Terry denies Brighi a highly presentable shooting chance from 18 yards after smart work from Totti.</p> <p>I'm really sorry about this.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Lampard has a pot-shot from 25 yards but, very unusually, don't hit the target or even get near to hitting it. </p> <p>I'm really sorry about this.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> The referee plays a non-existence advantage for Chelsea on the edge of the box; Roma break crisply and Totti plays a good pass down the inside-right channel for the onrushing Aquilani, whose cross-shot is blocked by Terry.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> It's times like these, against teams who park the bus, that Chelsea miss the mischief and imagination of Joe Cole. Kalou is very underrated, and Malouda has certainly improved this season, but neither really know how to go through the eye of the needle as Cole can.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half time: Chelsea 0-0 Roma</strong> That was a shambles and I can only apologise. It wasn't much better on the field, with a surprisingly listless/cautious (I can't decide which, not helped by the fact I only saw about two minutes of the game) Chelsea showing no real sign of breaking down a well-packed Roma defence.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time chit-chat while various flunkies are dismembered</strong> \"Is it me,\" begins Patrick Sullivan, \"or have Roma more stuffed in their locker than previously imagined?\" Not necessarily: there were a couple of sharp breaks, as far as I could discern, but that was all. They have been solid defensively, which is kind of what we expected, no?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>I suppose if - if - Chelwsea lost this</strong> and then the return in Roma, they might feel the heat of a potential farce on the back of their neck but, still, there's essentially nothing to worry about, as even then they would probably get through by beating Cluj at home and drawing away to Bordeaux.</p> <p>\"Just saw on ESPN that John Terry's masterful miss in the CL final last year is No5 on their 'Year's greatest Championship moments', or some tosh,\" says Damian Koblintz. \"Who said Americans don't have a sense of humour?\" The Germans have it No1, though, so.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Okay</strong>, it looks like everything will be fine for the second half. Thankfully the horse remained fast asleep while various eejits took over an hour to shut the stable door.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Off we go again. I'm so confused that I've just tried to turn the TV volume down by dragging the volume button on the Mac. Anyway, Belletti has come on for Malouda. Analyse that. It's an odd one: Belletti has gone to the right of the front three, with Kalou switching to the left.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> Belletti, trying to make lightning strike twice after Saturday's howitzer, thwangs over from 30 yards.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Belletti seems slightly unnatural in his role, as you'd expect, so he's currently taking up the positions of a wide-right player in a 4-4-2 rather than a 4-3-3. He's probably 10 yards behind Kalou on the opposite flank at any given time.</p> <p>It's a faster start from Chelsea, but so far they've only put the puff in powder puff. I accept that this is a preposterous conclusion to draw after four whole minutes of the half, but I've done it now and it's not like there's a delete button on these things, so.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Charlie Wilson serves to libel both myself and Scott Murray - two impeccable pros - in one email, and will be hearing from our lawyers quicksmart.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Brighi takes a flailing elbow from Carvalho - the Sky boys are 109% sure it was accidental; I'm not so sure - and goes down. Brighi is booed by the crowd for the heinous crime of <em>HAVING A MAN'S ELBOW RAKED ACROSS HIS NOSE</em>. These bloody foreigners, eh?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> The ref, it has to be said, is a risible jobsworth. When Carvalho, bustling for a corner, drags Mexes into the Roma net, the ref blows up so dramatically that you'd think someone had just started giving birth. Mexes, predictably, was back on his feet straight away.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> It's all Chelsea, possession-wise, but Roma are still fairly unperturbed, and Doni hasn't had to get his short-sleeved goalkeeper's jersey especially dirty. In many ways this is becoming a Mourinho game, the sort they win 1-0 through mental strength rather than technical quality.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>58 min</strong> Is there anything in the fact that Chelsea's weakest performances - Spurs, Manchester United, Roma - under Scolari have all been at home? Tactically that doesn't make much sense, but it's becoming a bit of a pattern. They've shown nothing in the final third in the last half an hour.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> Simone Perrotta comes on for the injured Aquilani.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> Lampard swings in a free-kick from the right and, with everyone dithering, Kalou thumps a header towards goal from 12 yards. Doni plunges to his left to make a decent but ultimately straightforward save.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> There's certainly a sense that the Chelsea tide is rising, but it's doing so very, very slowly. \"Hackman's curse, my friend, Hackman's curse,\" says Patrick Sullivan with an insouciant malevolence I'd be proud to call my own.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Mikel shoots from 25 yards, and puts it the same distance wide. Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> This is garbage. This is everything that's bad about the Champions League group stages, because while both sides want to do well, they don't <em>need</em> to do well. It applies to Roma, even though they've come for a 0-0: their counter-attacks are almost absent-minded, with none of the purpose and menace they would carry were this the first leg of a knockout game. The same goes for Chelsea, who are subconsciously accepting an off-night in the way they just would not do were this a knockout game.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Anelka is caught offside for the 947th time, a record only exceeded by Pippo Inzaghi in every single game he's every played.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Anelka just runs into a perfectly clean challenge from Brighi, so the dreadful referee, Kyros Vassaras, gives Chelsea a free-kick maybe 32.3 yards out. Deco touches it off, and Lampard fizzes one straight into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong> Terry is booked for high feet on Totti. It was a harsh decision, in truth, but it's worth it just to see the bewildered look on Terry's face. I wonder whether Keith Hackett will try to extend the powers of his position tomorrow to a) rescind that yellow card and b) widen the goal so that Terry's penalty in Moscow counts.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Lampard opens the game up with a smart, first-time pass to the excellent Bosingwa, who tears down the right and bullets a low cross towards the six-yard box. Christian Panucci, 97, humps it clear.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Roma (Terry 77)</strong> John Terry scores a goal born of the purest desire. Lampard clipped a corner to the near post and Terry, roaring towards the ball from a deeper, central position, flicked it across goal and into the vacant far corner. Nobody on the post eh. I'm not sure just how much Terry knew about the flick, because the momentum of the challenge flipped his body round a bit, but his desire was wonderful, and he hurt himself in the process of scoring as well.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Just before the corner was taken, the young Argentinian striker Franco Di Santo came on for Chelsea in place of er, in place of, er, in place of. We'll get back to you.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> Roma, forced to do weird things like attacking now, replace Taddei with the highly promising young French forward Jeremy Menez. Menez trots onto the field with all the enthusiastic body language of a man asked to Chippendale at an old people's home. An all-male old people's home.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Roma bring on Max Tonetto for, I think, John Arne Riise. It's not really possible to confuse anyone else with Riise, is it, but I was looking the other way.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Terry, showing that the scoring of an admirable goal need not overshadow one's not inconsiderable numpty side, eases his forearm into the chest of Mexes as the player jostle at a free-kick. With a more ostentatious ref, he might have walked. Actually there aren't any refs more ostentatious than this clown, so I presume he didn't see it.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> This game has become bitty and niggly - Panucci is whinging about all sorts, and is finally booked as a result - and that certainly suits Chelsea. This group of players have lived this scene a million times - 1-0 up with time running out - and it's hard to see a different ending this time.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Chelsea have had six shots on target. You don't really need me to tell you how many Roma have had, do you?</p> <p>Just looking at that Terry goal again, Belletti did a sort of Steve Hodge (remember how he used to lean into the last man in the wall to make space for Pearce's curled free-kicks?) on Mexes, deliberately blocking him so that Terry could get a clear run on the near post. It was certainly nowhere near as brazen as the number Carvalho did on Victor Valdes a few years ago, but it was still probably a foul. Mind you, they are never given.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Roma have nothing to offer bar a misplaced sense of grievance at the result. Chelsea are keeping the ball with ease, and deserve their victory for <em>actually trying to win the bloody game</em>.</p> <p>Three minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full time: Chelsea 1-0 Roma</strong> That's the end of a game that was a great advert for doing something else on a Wednesday night. Roma, who came for a 0-0, were to blame in moral terms, but Chelsea got nowhere near the giddy stratospheres they have reached this season, and it took a trademark goal from John Terry late on to give them the win. Thanks for your emails, and apologies again for our first-half difficulties.</p>",
  "<p>I received an intriguing email a couple of weeks ago. The <a href=\"http://www.scriptologist.com/Magazine/Tips/Logline/logline.html\">logline</a> for my first short film, Maconie's List is registered on <a href=\"http://www.inktip.com/index.php\">InkTip.com</a>. To recap, it's the story of a lonely, depressed woman who hires <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/jun/21/ladiary19lookingforaknac\">a hitman</a> to kill her on her 40th birthday, only to change her mind at the last minute when she gets asked out on date. It's not autobiographical, honest guv.</p> <p>InkTip is one of those wonderful sites that you only get to hear about through people \"in the know\"; essentially it's where producers, directors and others go to find original material. It can be lucrative too; a friend of mine here made $4,000 out of a script deal via the site.<br> So out of nowhere a girl called Grace emailed to say that she was looking for a play to perform at her college finals and wanted to know if I would let her adapt my short. <br></p> <p>Having written a couple of plays that were critiqued at the Soho Theatre, I jumped at the chance. I love that form of writing and <a href=\"http://www.crackle.com/c/Drama_Short_Films/Maconie_s_List/2098681#ml=o%3d7%26fcx%3d170%26fk%3dmaconie's%2520list%26fx%3d\">Maconie's List</a> lends itself very nicely to theatre. It's linear, the sets are simple and it's dialogue/character heavy. I have a few ideas for the adaptation which involve cherry picking the best bits of my original script with the best bits of the shooting script but ultimately, it'll be up to Grace to bring it to life. Why's that? Well, I'm in LA and she's studying performing arts at a college in Cumbria.</p> <p>I'll keep you posted on how the project develops. Meanwhile, I could have sworn I was at Barfly in Camden on Saturday for <a href=\"http://www.ardenkaywin.com/\">Arden Kaywin</a>'s album launch. She was the girl I met on the plane to New York last month and along with an enthusiastic crowd of friends, family and fans I watched her perform a short set at <a href=\"http://www.themintla.com/\">The Mint</a> on Pico. </p> <p>Strutting around the stage in her little green mini-dress, she totally rocked. I love her stuff, it's intelligent and quirky, and I'm not just saying that because she's going to read this; me and my housemate have been playing her record around the house. One of her songs from the album, The Elephant in the Room, was used in the film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713/\">The House Bunny</a>, only you won't hear it because the scene was cut. And as Arden told me with a sad face, \"that means I don't get paid\". Oh well, them's the breaks but <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/fun-stuff/17-buzz/arden-kaywin-new-album\">she's getting good press</a> and I can see her becoming a big star. </p> <p>The Mint is one of those long established LA venues, like the Formosa, that I make a point of rooting out. Owners past and present have been careful to preserve the essence of what made it special in the first place and even though some years back one set of owners bought the premises next door, it's still small enough to have that cosy rock vibe. The guy on the door was the size of a Hummer and there were vinyl records stuck to the ceiling. It was great. </p> <p>Best of all, it was very un-LA, and by that I mean that the clientele were made up of the kind of crowd you'd see at a gig anywhere. Typically at a party in LA the room will be botox deep in models, actors and other-worldly creatures so beautiful/thin/flawless that your eyes start running. I'm still in awe of the up-close effects of cosmetic surgery. It's bloody awful and I know I'll never succumb. Having said that watching someone's forehead not move during a conversation is a singular form of entertainment.</p> <p>Fortunately, I'm having a few days off from the young and the beautiful. I'm in <a href=\"http://www.filmsantabarbara.com/\">Santa Barbara</a> for a couple of days with my writer/producer friend Tanya, who is on the verge of being either very famous, or very rich, or both. I can't quite work out which but I've told her that I'll be her <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kato_Kaelin\">Kato Kaelin</a> and live in her guesthouse when she buys her fortress in the Hollywood Hills. Her dog Lily died last week, which was very sad, and I don't even like dogs. This place changes you. Pass the botox.</p>",
  "<p>How would you feel if your DNA were used without your permission to produce cloned human embryos for medical research? Regardless of whether it is right or wrong to experiment on human embryos, creating them would require either giving women high doses of drugs with unknown side effects to produce the large numbers of eggs needed for cloning research, or the placing of your genes inside cows' or pigs' eggs to produce human-animal hybrid embryos.</p> <p>So you might well expect to be asked to give your explicit permission before such a morally fraught procedure is carried out using your tissue, but the government doesn't see the need for this. At virtually the last minute, ministers added amendments to the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmbills/120/08120.67-73.html\">human fertilisation and embryology bill</a> which will receive its final vote in the Commons <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/humanfertilisationandembryology.html\">today</a>, that will allow researchers to use the DNA of tissue donated anonymously in the past to create cloned human embryos. Other amendments would permit the genes of children or of mentally incapacitated adults to be used in similar ways.</p> <p>Cloning people without their permission violates the principle of informed consent, the right we have to control what is done to or with our bodies. In the case of organ donation, even though your heart or kidneys could be of immediate and genuine benefit to another person \u2013 unlike cloning research, where the benefits, if any, are far in the future \u2013 you still have the right to refuse. Most of us remember the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/alderhey\">Alder Hey</a> scandal, in which many parents were profoundly grieved by the discovery that parts of their dead children's bodies had been removed without their permission.</p> <p>Furthermore, unlike other controversial provisions of the HFE bill, such as the creation of human-animal hybrid embryos, which went through a high-profile public consultation and debates in both houses of parliament, the government slipped in these amendments, overturning the principle of consent, at the last minute, just before the committee stage, and with so little fanfare that many MPs, let alone the general public, are unaware of the issue. The alliance of scientists, biotech enthusiasts and parliamentarians behind the amendments seem to believe that no public case needs to be made for these changes, convinced as they are that cloning is the next big thing in medical research and that the UK has to be the Silicon Valley of this new industry. The dense thicket of over 100 amendments added to the HFE bill provided the perfect opportunity to slip in provisions that would otherwise be extremely controversial.</p> <p>Should these amendments get through without proper scrutiny and debate, they could create the conditions for a scandal that would dwarf the events at Alder Hey. Those in the biomedical community who see no need for consent should bear in mind that, first, much medical research depends absolutely on public trust and confidence that researchers are motivated not only by a desire to help humanity but also by respect for donors, and, second, that should someone who objects to cloning find out they have been cloned and thus alert the general public to this possibility, then the supply of tissue donors could shrink or even dry up. Parliament should bear in mind that one of the UK's biggest ever bioscience research projects, the \u00a361m <a href=\"http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk\">Biobank</a>, which aims to improve our understanding and treaments of common diseases such as cancer and diabetes using tissue and health information from 500,000 middle-aged participants, could be undermined by a controversy over what is done to donated tissue.</p> <p>The Commons has one last chance today to uphold the principle of consent and ensure widespread continued public participation in medical research. Let's hope it takes it.</p>",

His first PMQs of the autumn was a bit of a failure; almost all commentators said it was a (rare) straight sets win for <strong>Gordon Brown</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>11.52am:</strong> He and Brown did not appear last week and today, with the Tories on the back foot over yachtgate (sorry - I just couldn't think of another shorthand for it), Cameron must feel under pressure to deliver a knock-out performance.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>11:57am:</strong> Luckily, there's a good issue for him to hand. Does Brown agree with Mervyn King that Britain is \"entering a recession\"? Brown ought to be able to deal with this by simply saying yes, but he's never admitted that we're heading into a recession before (which would amount to an admission that the era of boom and bust has returned, contrary to what we were told ad nauseam while he was at the Treasury) and he's not very good at facing up to this sort of thing. Sometimes in the past he's preferred to squirm rather than acknowledge an unpalatable truth. It'll be interesting to see what he does this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12:03pm:</strong> Brown starts with condolences to the family of a soldier killed in Afghanistan, Trooper James Munday.</p> <p>He also sends his condolences to the family of Gayle Williams, the charity worker killed by the Taliban. It was a \"barbaric act\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12:05pm: Jim Sheridan</strong> (Lab, Paisley and Renfrewshire North) asks Brown to assure him that measures will be taken to stop people losing their homes.</p> <p>Brown says he's announcing new guidance to the judiciary today that should make it easier for people to stay in their homes.</p> <p>He raises the King speech. He says that he agrees with King about the banking system coming close to collapse. He does not use the R word.</p> <p>A summit of global leaders will be announced this afternoon. Brown will attend.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12:06pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>David Cameron</strong></p> <p>The Tory leader also pays tribute to the dead soldier and aid worker.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12:06pm:</strong> In the first six months of the year the government borrowed \u00a337bn. At the end of a long boom, and just as the downturn is beginning, borrowing is going up. Is that a mistake?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12:07pm:</strong> Brown quotes Cameron on the radio earlier this week saying that borrowing does go up in a downturn. This gets a good response from the Labour side. Which side is Cameron on?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12:09pm:</strong> Cameron says of course borrowing goes up in a downturn. The problem is Brown \"racked it up to record levels\" before the downturn began. Look at the items the government's borrowing figures do not include, he says, referring to PFI etc. </p> <p>Brown could not lecture the banks on borrowing because he borrowed so much himself, and he could not lecture them on transparency either, the Tory leader says. Brown is a \"master of dodgy accounting\". There's lots of heckling. Half of the OECD had budget surpluses when they went into downturn. Did Brown have no regrets?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12:11pm:</strong> Brown says he cut the levels of debt. Does Cameron want him to close schools and hospitals? Net debt is lower than it is in countries like the US and Japan. Brown quotes Cameron again, saying \"People will want cross-party support.\" Cameron says \"one thing one week, one thing the next week\".</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12:11pm:</strong> Cameron says he has support on the banking deal, but not on borrowing. For years Brown was telling the public about \"prudence with a purpose\". Now he's going on about borrowing with a purpose. Cameron mentions King's comments and recessions and asks Brown if he will accept that the boom is being followed by a bust.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12:13pm:</strong> Brown says: \"I've already said I agree with the governor of the Bank of England.\" A coded admission that we are going into recession, I think. How very Brownish. He goes on to quote Cameron saying that opposition politicians should not talk down the economy.</p> <p>Cameron says Brown is the cause of the problem. Will Brown finally admit that he did not abolish boom and bust?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12:14pm:</strong> Again, Brown says he's already answered the point about the Bank of England governor (which is not what Cameron asked this time). Everyone knows that this is a problem that originated in America, he says. </p> <p>If the Tories are really interested in supporting small businesses, they should be supporting what the government is doing. If the Tories cannot understand the problem, they won't have a solution, the prime minister says.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12:15pm:</strong> Cameron says everyone knows that Brown took credit for the boom, and so they expect him to acknowledge the bust. He puts the question again: has Brown abolished boom and bust?</p> <p>Brown says there is no return to the days of 15% interest rates. Politicians will be judged on their decisions. He criticises Tory policy in various areas, like Northern Rock.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12:16pm:</strong> Cameron tries again: \"Why not admit, for once in your life, you have not ended boom and bust?\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12:17pm:</strong> Brown accuses Cameron of not mentioning any policies and not living up to what he said about supporting the government. The Tories have no \"constructive policies\".</p> <p><strong>Energy prices</strong></p> <p>Brown says the government will monitor energy prices, to see whether customers are benefiting from the fall in oil prices.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12:18pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong></p> <p>The Lib Dem leader also offers his condolences to the dead soldier and aid worker.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12:18pm:</strong> The public have seen the government offer a bail-out to the banks. When will there be a bail-out for pensioners facing poverty this winter, Clegg asks.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12:19pm:</strong> Brown says he has been putting liquidity into the banking system for months (implying that he did not just decide to help them at the last moment). On pensioners Brown says Clegg knows that the pension is more than \u00a330 a week - a clever reference to Clegg's conference gaffe, when he said the state pension was worth \u00a330 a week, instead of about \u00a390 a week. Brown also mentions policies that will help pensioners.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>12:21pm:</strong> Clegg says Brown is \"all at sea\", but unlike other MPs not on a luxury yacht (the only reference to yachtgate so far). </p> <p>Will Brown agree to change the way energy tariffs are priced, so that people have an incentive to use less? (This is Lib Dem policy - they don't like the way standing charges meant that people in effect pay most for the first chunk of energy they use, then less for the extra energy they use on top of that.)</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>12:23pm:</strong> Brown says the Lib Dems would have more credibility if they had not promised \u00a320bn of spending cuts.</p> <p><strong>Energy</strong></p> <p>Brown says he will not take the advice of the Tories on this. Their fuel duty stabiliser plan would mean fuel duty would now be going up.</p> <p><strong>Business rates</strong></p> <p><strong>John Whittingdale</strong> (Con, Maldon and East Chelmsford) asks Brown to reinstate business rates relief for empty property.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12:25pm:</strong> Brown says he will look at this.</p> <p><strong>Women</strong></p> <p><strong>Lynda Waltho</strong> (Lab, Stourbridge) asks Brown to promise not to hire a PR firm to get into women's \"pretty little heads\". It's a reference to the PR company advising the Tories on how to make themselves more popular with women.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12:26pm:</strong> Brown says he doesn't need to do this.</p> <p><strong>Public services</strong></p> <p>Brown says St Helen's hospital is being opened today - the 100th new hospital being built under the government's hospital renovation programme.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12:26pm:</strong><br> <strong>Ex-servicemen in prison</strong></p> <p><strong>Elfyn Llwyd</strong>, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, asks Brown to help support ex-servicemen in prison, who he says account for 10% of the prison population.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12:27pm:</strong> Brown says the government is working on this issue to get accurate data about the number of people involved, and to see what can be done to help.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>12:29pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Manchester congestion charge</strong></p> <p><strong>Graham Stringer</strong> (Lab, Manchester Blackley) asks about the referendum in Manchester on its proposed congestion charge. He's opposed to the charge and he claims the question is biased.</p> <p>Brown says the question had to be approved legally.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>12:30pm:</strong><br> <strong>Gun and knife crime</strong></p> <p><strong>Karen Buck</strong> (Lab, Regent's Park and Kensington North) says there is evidence showing that some people are carrying guns or knives because media reports about the prevalence of gun and knife crime have frightened them into thinking its necessary.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>12:31pm:</strong> Brown mentions some of the initiatives the government has taken on this. The important thing is to \"change the whole culture\" relating to carrying knives.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>12:32pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Water charges</strong></p> <p>In response to a question from <strong>Adrian Sanders</strong> (Lib Dem, Torbay) about water charges in south-west England, Brown says the region has benefited from Labour.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>12:32pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Yachtgate</strong></p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338878875\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1872537374_gdn-nat-20081022-jd-pmq-economy-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover) asks for an assurance that, however desperate the nation's finances get, Brown will never meet a Russian billionaire to try to get some money. It's a very fun, but pointed question - classic Skinner.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>12:35pm:</strong> There's lots of laughter, but Brown says it's a serious issue. He says he hopes that the matter is investigated \"by the authorities\". It's not clear what authorities he's referring to - the parliamentary commissioner for standards? - but it certainly takes the story on. No doubt we'll find out later what Brown is expecting.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>David Cameron:</strong> Good, but not his best performance. His questions about borrowing did not work well, but he challenged Brown effectively over the end of boom and bust four times in a row in a way that should play well on the news bulletins.</p> <p><strong>Gordon Brown:</strong> Is he being better briefed? He used Cameron quotes against the Tory leader quite powerfully. It undermined Cameron in the chamber, but also depicted Cameron to a wider audience as inconsistent, which is an important political message.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Brown on the recession:</strong> A non-admission admission. He never acknowledged that Britain is heading into recession in direct language, but by saying that he agreed with King he was implicitly accepting this. He made a point of saying this twice, just to make sure that we got the message. The media can now report Brown as accepting that we're going into recession. That means that when he does utter the word directly, he'll no doubt turn round and say: \"What's the big deal? I've admitted this before.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>A yachtgate probe?</strong> Dennis Skinner's question was brilliant. And, by calling for an investigation, Brown is doing his best to keep this story in the news. \"Tory sleaze\" was a fantastic vote winner for Labour in the 1990s and Brown is clearly keen for a rerun.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Nick Clegg:</strong> Clegg made a good point about pensioners and the bankers. But Brown cut his legs off with the joke about the \u00a330 pension.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong about Brown on the recession. Having checked the quotes, I see that he did utter the word directly, in relation to Britain, but it was convoluted (which is probably why I missed it). </p> <p>This is what he said: \"The governor of the Bank of England said last night that not since the first world war has the international banking system been so close to collapse, and I agree with him. Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession which is likely to cause recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the aftermath of the tragic <a href=\"http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117&amp;Itemid=166\">suicide at Dignitas</a> in Switzerland of Daniel James, the 23-year-old British man paralysed in a rugby accident, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/19/euthanasia-daniel-james-health-law\">Mary Warnock</a> made an elegantly reasoned argument for legalising assisted suicide. But I disagree with her conclusion. <br> Impassioned arguments for legalisation by other commentators often fail to consider the implications of taking such a radical step. US Supreme Court chief justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that \"hard cases make bad law\". The cases of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1682546.stm\">Diane Pretty</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7644094.stm\">Debbie Purdy</a> and Daniel James are indeed hard, involving as they do a fully functioning mind trapped in a body that is \u2013 or soon will be \u2013 an unresponsive shell. It's no coincidence that the assisted suicide cases that have been the subject of high court rulings in the UK, the US and Canada have involved patients suffering from motor neurone disease (called ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease in the US). <br> In several <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-it-must-be-right-to-let-people-decide-if-they-want-to-die-966944.html\">commentaries</a> I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/death-assistedsuicide\">have read</a>, logic has vanished into a terminological fog as disparate terms \u2013 assisted dying, assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide and mercy killing are confused and conflated. Those who disagree are labeled as religious zealots. While it's true that many opponents are motivated by religious convictions, others \u2013 such as myself \u2013 are not. <br> The rush to legalisation neglects a fundamental difference between legal and moral judgements. While what is legal and what is ethical often overlap, in compelling cases, there's a strong temptation to set a precedent that can become problematic when enshrined in laws applying to everyone and every case. I oppose legalisation, because of the unavoidable risk of abuse, a risk that is particularly clear in the American context in which I've spent most of my life. Our radical individualism undermines solidarity. Our medical culture is rife with self-interest and distrust, engendered by extreme litigiousness and insurance companies that stand between patients and their physicians.  In 1997, when the constitutionality of physician assisted suicide came before the US Supreme Court, solicitor general Walter Dellinger, representing the Clinton administration, made an argument with which I agree: terminally ill patients have a liberty interest in not having the state prevent their relief from severe pain and suffering through physician-<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EEDE1F39F93AA35752C0A961958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=dellinger%20assisted%20suicide&amp;st=cse\">assisted suicide</a>. However, this interest is trumped by the need to protect vulnerable patients. The systemic dangers are \"dramatic\" in a society that allows doctor-assisted suicide, Dellinger said. \"The least costly treatment for any illness is lethal medication.\" Although the court found no constitutionally protected right to physician-assisted suicide, individual states could choose to permit it. Eleven years on, only Oregon has made that choice. <br> Britain has been my second home long enough for me to see the solidarity of NHS fraying in the face of financial pressures. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4848646.stm\">Medical care for the elderly</a> can fall below the standard of adequacy and even common decency. Financial considerations are pervasive. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7678843.stm\">GPs are receiving incentives</a> not to refer patients to hospital. Rationing decisions for cancer drugs are often in the news. Rationing will come to resemble battlefield triage as the population ages and more expensive technologies and drugs become available. In this environment, legalised assisted suicide would allow or even invite coercion. Those who are in pain or receiving sub-standard care are in no position to make a voluntary choice. Going gently into that good night is certainly the least costly alternative. <br> The law requires bright lines. Could the line hold if Lord Joffe's bill becomes law and physician-assisted suicide is permitted for the terminally ill? One could argue that terminal illness isn't a morally relevant criterion; others who are ill \u2013 like Debbie Purdy \u2013 suffer grievously. The most acute suffering can be psychological. What about a paralysed young person who has lost the will to live \u2013 like Daniel James or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/14/international/europe/14france.html\">Vincent Humbert</a> in France? An elderly person with nothing to look forward to can also suffer \u2013 like the healthy 79-year-old <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/world/europe/03germany.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=assisted%20suicide%20german%20woman&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">German woman</a> who was helped to die? Some years ago, a Dutch jurist named <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/328/7449/1204\">Huib Drion</a> suggested that a suicide pill be made available to all 75 year olds who lived alone. Don't we find ourselves at the bottom of a slippery slope after a slide that was as incremental as it was inevitable? <br> How should British courts deal with someone who has taken a loved one to Switzerland to die and then returns to the UK? In my view, assisting a suicide requires more than accompanying someone on an airplane. The way forward is not to change the law in Britain to make it consistent with Swiss law, which allows for the actions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/05/health.law\">Dignitas</a>. Neither the Dutch nor the state of Oregon offers end-of-life services for non-residents. They require the existence of an established doctor-patient relationship through which mental state and the durability of the request can be assessed. The Swiss have sunk to the lowest common moral denominator. The British people deserve better.</p>",
  "<p>You could tell them by their bell-bottomed trousers, fringes and jauntily-tilted caps - and if you saw them, you were advised to cut and run.</p> <p>They ran the grimy streets of Manchester and filled the city's courts and police cells, while the media described their codes and gang names in lurid detail - the Bengal Tigers, the Meadow Lads and the She Battery Mob.</p> <p>But this wasn't another outbreak of modern gun crime, teenage stabbings or hoodie trouble-making. The 'scuttlers', as the whole of Britain learned to know and detest them, were a serious social problem in the 1870s and 80s. </p> <p>Influenced by an empire almost permanently at war, from the Sudan to Afghanistan, they took over music halls, openly paraded with home-made weapons and staged fights where more than 500 young people took part.</p> <p>Their history has now been chronicled by a Liverpool university academic, Dr Andrew Davies, after years in their company in the peaceful reading rooms of archives from Manchester to London. His research uncovers all the features of 21st-century concern about youth crime, but on a larger scale, and 140 years ago.</p> <p>\"There are so many records that it has taken me 15 years to pull all the material together,\" says Davies, whose book, The Gangs of Manchester: The Story of the Scuttlers, is published this month with public readings in the city and plans for a future play. </p> <p>\"Matching press reports with police, court and prison records gives a picture of relentless urban violence by young men going through the new, compulsory school system and out into the mills and factories of Manchester.\"</p> <p>The staged fights also involved \"scuttlerettes\", girls as young as 14 who were accused of raising the level of violence by flirting with rival youths and egging them on. In Liverpool, according to Davies' researches, gangs were often motivated by robbery, carried out by way of a more vicious version of Fagin's pickpockets in Oliver Twist. But in Manchester, the motive was testosterone-fuelled excitement and a hunt for status. </p> <p>\"Each gang wanted to be recognised as the toughest in the city, and scuttlers would walk as far as five miles to take on rivals,\" says Davies. \"Groups took possession of their favourite music halls and attacked any members of other gangs who came in, using sharpened belt buckles or knives as weapons.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338866410\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/GANGgroup.jpg\" alt=\"Police mugshots of Manchester gangsters\" width=\"220\" height=\"373\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some example police mugshots of Manchester gangsters, including identifying features such as \"left leg much thinner than right\"</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then as now, individuals were singled out by both police and media. One reprobate was John-Joseph Hillier, the Irish-born leader of the Deansgate Mob, who joined the gang when he was 14. He was repeatedly jailed for slashing members of the rival Casino gang with a butcher's knife and was nicknamed \"King of the Scuttlers\" by reporters.</p> <p>Delighted with the notoriety, he had the name sewn on to the front of the trademark jersey he wore with his bell-bottoms and cap. The word 'scuttle' was coined by the boys as a term for street-fighting.</p> <p>Davies says that one major difference from today's youth violence was that deaths were very rare. But the level of serious woundings - and the sheer number of young teenagers filling the newly-built Strangeways prison and other jails - led Manchester city council to petition the then home secretary for the return of flogging to punish violent crime.</p> <p>In the end, with the authorities acknowledging the effect of the 19th century's catalogue of international violence - gangs in battles such as the Rochdale Road War called themselves either 'Russians' or 'Turks' - the answer was more thoughtful. A philanthropic movement to set up Lads Clubs took root in the worst-affected areas, including the core of Salford, which Friedrich Engels had described several decades earlier as the world's classic urban slum.</p> <p>Church leaders and others, including the Manchester Guardian, recognised the role of status and competition in scuttler society and diverted it into boxing and sporting competitions, especially football. Davies says: \"They were very successful in working with younger boys who might have been expected to form the next cohort of the gangs.\"</p> <p>The book dwells on the parallels with today, and Davies says that he was fascinated by the unchanging role of dress and personal appearance as a sign of belonging to a gang. He details scuttler hairstyle, known in the 1870s as a \"donkey fringe\", which required close cropping at the back but an angled fringe at the front, with the hair longer on the right.</p> <p>Differently-coloured scarves completed the uniform. Most scuttlers added brass tips to their clogs to add an intimidating rattle to the normal clatter of the footwear on the city's cobbles. Davies says: \"You could well imagine a scuttler finding himself at a concert a hundred years later and blending right in.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the Nairobi Stock Exchange index was to plunge by the margins witnessed in major capitals across the world, you would be more likely to see celebrations in the streets than the recriminations witnessed from New York to London.</p> <p>That's simply down to the gross inequalities in Kenya where players in the stockmarket are viewed as beneficiaries of recent economic growth \u2013 to the exclusion of the vast poor majority.</p> <p>People in those parts of the country that enjoy political patronage live 16 years longer <a href=\"http://www.inequalitykenya.or.ke/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=5\">than others</a> and the 10% richest households control more than 42% of incomes while the poorest 10% make do with 0.76% \u2013 so the resentment is not surprising.</p> <p>Indeed, the opposition <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Democratic_Movement\">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) partly campaigned on a platform of ensuring greater equity at the last election and its leaders explicitly attacked players in the stockmarket as the poster boys of an economic model that fosters inequality.</p> <p>Yet despite the generally ambivalent attitude to the global economic slowdown (and occasional smug, tongue-in-cheek letter to the editor suggesting that Kenyans chip in some aid to buffeted western states) the crisis poses a significant threat to millions across sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>The danger is that remittances from Africans in the diaspora could decline as their incomes are affected in the west, with a potentially devastating effect for households in the continent and beyond.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/0,,contentMDK:21352016~isCURL:Y~menuPK:3145470~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:476883,00.html\">Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008</a> indicates that Kenya, for example, receives more cash in remittances ($1.3 billion or \u00a3748m in 2007) than it does net foreign direct investment (about $50.4m per year) or overseas development aid (roughly $200m a year).</p> <p>These inflows have a major impact on the economy. They have contributed to a real estate boom, boosted the investment of households on health and education and significantly increased household incomes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?theSitePK=1572893&amp;contentMDK=20693491&amp;pagePK=64168182&amp;piPK=6416806\">According</a> to the World Bank, money from the diaspora improved household income in Uganda by 11%, in Bangladesh by six per cent and in Ghana by five per cent. These are significant sums by any measure, and although much has been made of the fact that the troubles in the world economy may lead to a decline in commodity prices which have fuelled record growth rates in the developing world, a slowdown in the rate of remittances could have just as telling an impact.</p> <p>It could also throw up challenges to the tenuous peace in countries like Zimbabwe and Somalia where the collapse of the state means that remittances are the sole source of survival for millions and the motor for the last remaining vestiges of private sector.</p> <p>Yet this crisis could also offer an opportunity for African governments to make better use of the millions of their best-educated citizens who have emigrated to the west.</p> <p>Legislation to allow dual citizenship \u2013 lacking in many sub-Saharan countries \u2013 would mean those in the diaspora who often take up the citizenship of their host states could invest with far greater confidence in their homeland. Specific banking packages to reduce the cost of sending money back home would also be a help. Expanding the mobile phone money transfer service pioneered by the Kenyan company Safaricom would greatly expand the capacity of the millions of unbanked citizens to receive remittances.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important opportunity this crisis offers is a chance for African nations to acknowledge the existence of the vast, untapped potential in the remittances industry. Despite its contribution to economic growth, few governments actually acknowledge, much less court, the diaspora dollars as an important source of economic growth. But as aid slows down as an inevitable consequence of troubles in richer states, governments on the continent will have to change their predominant view of their citizens abroad as potential troublemakers at home because of their superior exposure, to the powerful agents of economic development that they are.</p>",
  "<p>It was founded by Benito Mussolini to promote Italian culture and over the years has played host to Ben Hur, Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York and many of Federico Fellini's best-known films. Now Rome's famous Cinecitta studios is to enter a new era after the <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994391.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">Italian government confirmed it is to sell its final stake</a> in the complex, meaning it will be entirely under private control for the first time.</p> <p>Cinecitta was set up by the Italian dictator in 1937 and was bombed by the allies during the second world war. Its 22 soundstages, including the legendary Studio 5 where Fellini worked, cover more than 2.1m square feet. </p> <p>In the 1950s Cinecitta was briefly nicknamed \"Hollywood on Tiber\" after playing host to a number of large-scale US productions, including Ben Hur and Quo Vadis. More recent productions include Spike Lee's Miracle at St Anna and Abel Ferrara's Go Go Tales. </p> <p>The privatisation process began in the 1980s after the studios came close to bankruptcy, but Silvio Berlusconi's government is now selling off its final 24% stake - with offers from outside Italy welcome - in a move which does not come as a surprise. Berlusconi's administration has taken a rather dim view of film-oriented spending since returning to power in May. The Rome film festival, which was founded only in 2006, has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/30/festivals.romefilmfestival\">threatened with budget cuts</a> by the Berlusconi-backed Gianni Alemanno, the city's new mayor and former neo-fascist youth leader.

  "<p><strong>Who are the Chagos islanders?</strong><br>Between 1967 and 1971 an estimated 2,000 Chagossians were driven from the archipelago in the Indian Ocean after Britain made a secret deal to lease the main island, Diego Garcia, to the US as an airbase.</p> <p><strong>Where did they go?</strong><br>The islanders were taken to Mauritius and Seychelles, more than 1,000 miles away, where many have lived in poverty ever since.</p> <p><strong>What was the dispute about?</strong><br>It pitted the security concerns of the US and UK against the islanders' wish to return. In 1998 a legal battle was launched in the name of one of the evicted islanders, Olivier Bancoult.</p> <p><strong>What was the result?</strong><br>After a 10-year battle, the law lords ruled that the surviving islanders do not have right to return. The outer islanders are 60 to 100 miles away from Diego Garcia.</p> <p>In November 2000, the high court ruled the initial expulsion of the islanders was illegal. In May 2007 the court of appeal found the British government guilty of abuse of power in trying to stop the islanders reclaiming their land. The law lords overturned both those rulings.</p> <p><strong>Why won't the UK let the islanders go back?</strong><br>In court, the Foreign Office said it would be \"precarious and costly\", amounting to a \"mass trespass\". The US argues that even letting the Chagossians return to other islands would present a security risk.</p> <p><strong>What is the airbase used for?</strong><br>It is a refuelling stop and base for air strikes, mostly recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p><strong>Why has the case taken so long?</strong><br>Robin Cook, who was foreign secretary, initially accepted the 2000 verdict. But after the September 11 2001 attacks, the Foreign Office fiercely resisted allowing Chagossians to return. It commissioned a feasibility study, and in 2004 issued two orders blocking their return. It also appealed against the 2000 and 2007 judgments.</p> <p><strong>Why was Britain involved?</strong><br>Chagossians are descended from 18th-century African and Indian labourers on French coconut plantations. Britain took over the islands from France in the Napoleonic wars. They were renamed the British Indian Ocean Territory in 1965.</p> <p><strong>What would have happened if the islanders won?</strong><br>An estimated 150 families would have returned.</p>",
  "<p>Let's put Yachtgate and tiffs within the Bullingdon Club aside for now and talk about something trivial for a spot of light relief: global recession and the recasting of the world's economic and political hierarchy.</p> <p>Overnight Mervyn King, ultra-cautious governor of the Bank of England, conceded that it \"now seems likely\" Britain is entering a recession. Or to put it in under-nuanced John Humphrys-speak: \"It's official; we are in recession now. You can't argue with the governor of the Bank of England,\" declared the country's most argumentative man.</p> <p>That's not all. We also learned this morning that India has launched a satellite on a moon mission, another chastening reminder in the year of the Beijing Olympics that the world order is changing. </p> <p>Yes, I know that the west overestimated the significance of the Soviet Union's launch of its pioneering Sputnik satellite. Most oldies can remember hearing that distinctive signal\u2026 \"bleep, bleep, bleep\" and wondering what it meant. </p> <p>All sorts of leftwingers who should have known better by 1957 joined in smug triumph-of-central-economic-planning rejoicing: even clever Denis Healey was reluctant to drop this one. Some things are best done by the state, space rockets, being one, bank rescues another. Most things aren't.</p> <p>A confident America, soon to be personified by JFK, took up the challenge and put a man on the moon by 1969: quite what for, we are still deciding. But Nikita Khruschev's \"we will bury you\" boast proved wide of the mark. </p> <p>Instead, the old USSR, exhausted by its Hitler war (so were we), was actually edging towards collapse, though it took 30 years (we are taking longer). China and India learned the right lessons and are developing more managed forms of capitalism than our own over-exuberant model of recent years, currently in receivership.</p> <p>If we want to be really miserable about the decline of the west \u2013 a recurring theme for 150 years - we could note in passing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008 \">Ewen MacAskill's report in today's Guardian</a> that the respected Pew research centre in the US is saying that America can no longer run an election for which 130 million voters turn up, hoping to exercise that most basic civic right. </p> <p>Inadequate and partisan electoral rolls, voter challenges, electronic but unreliable ballot boxes (remember those hanging Florida chads), all seem likely to contribute to potential mayhem on November 4-5. Just to complicate what should be a simple on-the-day act Americans are already being allowed to vote - have been for weeks regardless of the fast-changing political picture, which may change their decision.</p> <p>Dumb or what? Soon we will be asking ourselves: \"Did these people really send men to the moon once?\"</p> <p>Never mind, we have more urgent worries. Governor King's concern for inflationary pressures and for \"moral hazard\" (let the errant banks go bust) made him slow to acknowledge the enormity of the crisis. During a speech in Leeds last night he conceded that the system was closer to collapse than at any time since \u2013 wait for it \u2013 not 1929-31, but 1918.</p> <p>The Brown/Darling recapitalisation of the banks may have turned that particular corner. But the crisis is feeding through the system. Bankruptcies, corporate and personal (the two guinea word is \"deleveraging\"), will hit jobs in the wider economy. The virtuous cycle of the last 15 years is going into reverse. </p> <p>Oh yes, and global savings are leaving Britain, putting pressure on sterling. Off 6% overnight, it now trades around $1.63, compared with almost $2 when I was in the US in July. </p> <p>That will feed into inflation and hurt our over-lax trade imbalance, though \u2013 in theory \u2013 exports will also be cheaper. What exports?</p> <p>There will also be less credit around in our credit-dependent economy, where we have been busy borrowing Asian savings. </p> <p>What can King do? Lower interest rates, which he will belatedly agree to do. What can the government do? Speed up job-boosting public spending, as ministers promise to do, hastily polishing their busts of John Maynard Keynes. Actually, it's harder to do that than it looks: ministries are always underspending their budgets.</p> <p>As I type, expensive economists are disagreeing on the radio about the nature of the coming recession, its depth and length. </p> <p>It will hit the middle class south hardest, but skilled people are easier to re-employ, so it will be shallow, says jolly LSE brain, Lord Desai, a touch airily. One of his ex-pupils politely disagrees: it will be deep and nasty.</p> <p>There's always an upside to the downside, so we would do best to wish the Indians luck with their satellite and the Americans with their election, fasten our seat belts and hope for the best. In recession we may be kinder to each other, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/recession-credit-crunch-morrisons-waitrose\">nice John Harris suggests</a> in today's paper: the Morrison spirit!</p> <p>Did someone say that oil prices, now around $70 a barrel, have already fallen by half from their spot price peak a few months ago? Break open that last bottle of Asti Spumante? Not yet. Today's City pages report that Russia, Iran and Qatar, who control 60% of the world's gas deposits, are setting up a cartel. </p> <p>Welcome back Opec.</p>",

I asked Timo Soinen, CEO of development company Sulake, how Habbo became the virtual world's leading social destination for 13-16 year olds, and why gamers should be interested.<br></p> <p><strong>How do you think Habbo managed to become the leading virtual world for teenagers and so successful for so long? </strong><br>Habbo has been operating for eight years, and the user numbers around the world keep growing all the time \u2013 we still have lots of potential audience out there, we have just scratched the surface. </p> <p>Even in the early days of Habbo, one of the main advantages was that it is easy to access and play: you don't need to download any software; you just need an internet browser to log into the virtual world. Habbo is also a constantly evolving product as we bring new features to the service every month, keeping it fresh to our users. In doing this we listen and react to user feedback and do continuous research to understand our users' needs. Still, the most important factor is that Habbo is all about user generated content. It has so many active users who devote time and energy to create compelling content for their friends and other Habbos. After all, Habbo is a place for its users, and they are the ones who make Habbo what it is. </p> <p><strong>64% of British kids who use Habbo report that they have friends they've never met offline according to your Global Youth Survey. This freaks a lot of people out. What do you think has allowed this phenomenon to become possible? </strong><br>The whole concept of friendship has new meanings in the online world - in many social online services, having a lot of friends on your friendlist can be considered to be a cool thing. This can also be witnessed in how adults use Facebook and other social networks. When asked about \"real friends\", teens' answers are usually between 4 and 10. But for online services, the answer can be over a 100, and in these, there most certainly are friends that they have never met in real life. Our mission is to teach our users to safeguard their personal information and learn to be extremely careful when meeting friends from the online world.</p> <p>In general Habbo is about your virtual persona and anonymity. We don't allow our users to share their true identity in the service and encourage them not to do so in other services as well. </p> <p><strong>Why should gamers be interested in Habbo Hotel? </strong><br>This depends on what type of gamers we are talking about. As a virtual world, Habbo is a social open-ended game in itself and as such is suitable for everyone. In the Habbo world there are hundreds or even thousands of activities and quests going on all the time arranged by the users themselves. For people who like to play more traditional games, Habbo offers also a few free multiplayer games created by Sulake: SnowStorm (a virtual snow ball fight) and BattleBall, an easy to use yet in-depth strategy game where groups play against each other. There are also some casual games inside world, such as the one-on-one game WobbleSquabble, and you can also do some tricks jumping from the 100-foot high diving board. </p> <p><strong>What kinds of features are you putting into place that ensures that the content of Habbo grows with the age of the consumers? </strong><br>Habbo is typically a teen oriented virtual world; our core user age group being 13 to 16 year-olds. However, we have older users as well. Most of the content in Habbo is created by the users themselves - our role is to ensure that this content is not inappropriate and that the users follow the Habbo Way, our rules and code of conduct for the service. Our aim is not to appeal to adult users. To put it simply, Sulake offers tools for creativity and content creation and ensures that the environment to use these are as safe as possible. </p> <p><strong>You hold a lot of high-profile pop stars and branded events in Habbo (like Gorillaz' personal appearance a few years ago, etc). What do you say to parents who are concerned with the extended exposure their kids have to these messages? </strong><br>Celebrity visits have always been a really cool way for us to provide interesting content for our users. These are events that usually take place in a certain space inside the virtual world, and no one is ever forced to take part. Of course Habbo offers artists, athletes and other celebs a new and exciting way to meet their fans regardless of location. </p> <p>The way in which different brands and advertisers are part of the Habbo virtual world has always been important to us. First of all, we carefully select which brands are allowed to come to Habbo, ensuring they are a good fit. We don't belive in in-your-face advertising - we want the brands to take part in the community and not just push their commercial messages. </p> <p>Another type of brand/event exposure which is important to us is our cooperation with goodwill and youth organisations - we are working currently with over 30 different partners all over the world including Unicef, Red Cross, United Nations, NSPCC to name just a few. </p> <p><strong>Which other online community applications are you impressed with at the moment? </strong><br>Some industry experts predicted last year that 2008 would be the year of virtual worlds. Looking at the amount of applications that are currently in development you can definitely say that the experts had a point. There are lots of interesting projects on the rise, but it is hard to name any specific ones. Virtual worlds are mostly based on imaginary places, but there is one interesting project called Twinity.com, which is based on realistic 3D replicas of the world's most vibrant metropolises. It is interesting to see how it grows. Another interesting area is going to be user generated virtual spaces and mobile virtual worlds. </p> <p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong><br>Our primary focus for the future is to develop the Habbo virtual world continuously, and to listen to our users' demands in the process. We are also currently working on a few other virtual world projects, but it is too early to disclose any information on those.</p> <p>Check out the other interviews from the <a href=\"http://www.virtualworldsforum.com/\">Virtual Worlds Forum</a> interview series: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/oct/08/games.events\">Gaia Online</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/oct/09/games.events\">Dizzywood</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Chagos islanders evicted by the British government in the 1970s today lost their long-running battle to return to the Indian Ocean archipelago.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/24/politics.topstories3\"> islanders had previously won the right to return</a> to all islands except Diego Garcia, the main island, where there is a US military base.</p> <p>The 3-2 <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd081022/banc-1.htm\">ruling today by the law lords</a> overturns the islanders' victory and is the final stage of a legal battle that started 10 years ago.</p> <p>Lord Hoffmann ruled the government was entitled to legislate for a colony in the security interests of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>The US state department had argued that the islands might be useful to terrorists.</p> <p>Lord Hoffmann said: \"Some of these scenarios might be regarded as fanciful speculations, but in the current state of uncertainty the government is entitled to take the concerns of its ally into account.\"</p> <p>He rejected the argument by the Chagossians' lawyers that the government did not have the power to remove their right of abode in what is now known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). \"The law gives it and the law may take it away,\" he said.</p> <p>Lord Rodger and Lord Carswell agreed. Lord Bingham and Lord Mance dissented.</p> <p>Olivier Bancoult, the evicted islander who put his name to the legal bid when it started in 1998, said after the ruling: \"We are deeply disappointed but of course we fight on. We are consulting our legal team to see what we can do.\"</p> <p>Bancoult urged ministers to read the statements of the dissenting judges. \"They should put an end to the shameless victimisation of Chagossians and adopt a lawful policy of facilitating our return to our homeland.\"</p> <p>Britain took the Chagos islands from France in the Napoleonic wars. In 1971 the British government used an immigration ordinance to remove the inhabitants compulsorily so Diego Garcia could be used as a US base.</p> <p>Both the divisional court and the court of appeal had previously ruled that the Chagossians could return to the outer islands. The Foreign Office appealed against those judgments to the law lords.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, welcomed today's judgment as a vindication of the government's decision to appeal. </p> <p>\"We do not seek to excuse the conduct of an earlier generation. Our appeal to the House of Lords was not about what happened in the 1960s and 1970s. It was about decisions taken in the international context of 2004.</p> <p>\"This required us to take into account issues of defence [and] security of the archipelago and the fact that an independent study had come down heavily against the feasibility of lasting resettlement of the outer islands of BIOT.\"</p> <p>In his dissenting judgment, Lord Bingham declared as void and unlawful a 2004 order to declare, without the authority of parliament, that no person had the right of abode in the Chagos islands.</p> <p>The power to legislate without going to parliament was \"an anachronistic survival\", he said. \"The duty of protection cannot ordinarily be discharged by removing and excluding the citizen from his homeland.\"</p> <p>Lord Mance said factors relied on as justifying the order were based on a \"remote and unlikely risk\" of large-scale resettlement of the outer Chagos islands.</p> <p>Richard Gifford, who represented the Chagossians, said: \"It has been the misfortune of the Chagos islanders that their passionate desire to return to their homeland has been caught up in the power politics of foreign policy for the past 40 years.</p> <p>\"Sadly, their struggle to regain their paradise lost has been dismissed on legal grounds, but the political possibilities remain open for parliament the British public and the international community to continue to support.\"</p> <p>The law lords were told during the hearing in July that Diego Garcia was regarded by the US since the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a \"defence facility of the highest importance ... a linchpin for the UK's allies\".</p> <p>The Foreign Office argued that allowing the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/01/humanrights.usforeignpolicy\"> Chagossians to return would be a \"precarious and costly\" </a> operation, and the United States had said that it would also present an unacceptable risk to its base.</p> <p>While there were \"undeniably unattractive aspects\" to what had happened to the islanders in the 1970s, that was no longer what the case was about, Jonathan Crow QC, for the foreign secretary, told the lords. \"The Chagossians do not own any territory,\" Crow said. \"They have no property rights on the islands at all. What is being asserted is a right of mass trespass.\"</p> <p>Ten years ago the Chagossians began legal action for the right to return, and <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/04/ewenmacaskill\"> in 2000 the divisional court ruled their eviction illegal </a>. The foreign secretary at the time, Robin Cook, agreed they should be allowed to return to all the islands except Diego Garcia. But after the September 11 attacks in 2001, the US said Diego Garcia had become an important base for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>In 2004, the UK government issued orders in council that negated the court's ruling, but two years later the high court ruled in favour of the Chagossians. In May last year the government lost again at appeal. In November the lords granted the government leave to appeal but ordered it to pay all legal costs, regardless of the decision.</p> <p>A recent study found the small number of islanders likely to want to return to the archipelago permanently would be able to make a sustainable living.</p> <p>The study, backed by the Let Them Return campaign and written by John Howell, a former director of the Overseas Development Institute, suggested there were \"no physical, economic or environmental reasons\" to prevent resettlement on the islands of Peros Banhos and Salomon.</p> <p>Howell suggested about 150 families - fewer than 1,000 people and about a quarter of those entitled to go back - would want to return. Eco-tourism and fish exports could provide jobs and income. The total cost to the UK of resettlement would be about \u00a325m, the report said.</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday, the Guardian published an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/18/iraq-britainand911\">interview</a> with the former head of MI5, Stella Rimington in which she responded as follows to a question about the impact of the war against Iraq on the terror threat currently facing this country:</p> <blockquote> <p>Look at what those people who've been arrested or have left suicide videos say about their motivation. And most of them, as far as I'm aware, say that the war in Iraq played a significant part in persuading them that this is the right course of action to take. So I think you can't write the war in Iraq out of history. If what we're looking at is groups of disaffected young men born in this country who turn to terrorism, then I think to ignore the effect of the war in Iraq is misleading.</p> </blockquote> <p>As the interviewer, Decca Aitkenhead, noted, these views will be \"unremarkable\" to most Guardian readers. After all, numerous leaked reports in recent years have made it abundantly clear that our intelligence agencies had forewarned the government that the Iraq war would undermine our national security and worsen the terror threat. </p> <p>Back in 2003, a month before the war began, the Joint Intelligence Committee <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3101364.stm\">advised</a> prime minister Tony Blair that it ...</p> <blockquote> <p>... assessed that al-Qaida and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq.</p> </blockquote> <p>In 2006, a leaked four-page memo from the JIC entitled International Terrorism: Impact of Iraq <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article701127.ece\">said</a> that the war ...</p> <blockquote> <p>... has reinforced the determination of terrorists who were already committed to attacking the west and motivated others who were not ... Iraq is likely to be an important motivating factor for some time to come in the radicalisation of British Muslims and for those extremists who view attacks against the UK as legitimate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Again, none of this is new, and just about everyone apart from the government \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 and die-hard neocons accepts this to be the case. It is sad that our lying former prime minister is allowed to escape the consequences of his actions while touring the world lecturing on the need to uphold international law. Matters have got to such an appalling state that when documents reveal that Blair also <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9b448ace-9a52-11dd-bfe2-000077b07658.html\">lied</a> to the nation about the exemption given to Formula One from the ban on tobacco advertising, the most common response appears to be: \"Well, we never believed the rascal was telling the truth anyway.\"</p> <p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand. There can never be any justification for indiscriminate attacks on civilians anywhere in the world. Still, I think most people (not just Guardian readers) would agree that it would be foolish to deny that our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq have not quite gone to plan and indeed have contributed to making a bad situation even worse and that any serious effort at combating the terror threat must include a reappraisal of some of our policies overseas, particularly in the Middle East. </p> <p>So, why bring this up? Well, because, dear reader, recent months have seen the emergence of an odd new Muslim outfit calling itself the <a href=\"http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/\">Quilliam Foundation</a> whose leading figures have selflessly taken it upon themselves to deny the obvious and instead have been busily engaged in a rather bizarre attempt to try and whitewash the government's reckless actions overseas. </p> <p>Last Friday on Cif, the QF's Ghaffar Hussain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/islam-religion\">asked</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>... would Islamist terrorism still exist without western interventions into the Muslim world? The answer, clearly, is yes.</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer may well be yes, Mr Hussain, but the more relevant (and far less craven) question to have asked was surely whether recent western interventions have on balance helped or hindered us in the struggle against terrorism The answer from our very own intelligence services \u2013 who cannot be so casually smeared as being \"Islamists\" \u2013 should be apparent. </p> <p>In an earlier Cif <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/islam.religion\">article</a>, Ghaffar Hussain lambasted cooperation between Muslim groups and the left and accused them of being '\"westophobic\". And what is \"westophobia\"? According to Hussain it is a form of prejudice against \"western values\". </p> <p>It is true that many Muslim groups are very critical of some western policies in the Middle East and particularly US/UK support for Israel in spite of its utter disregard for international law, but that is by no means the same as saying they oppose western values. Indeed, by protesting against governmental deceit and warmongering propaganda I like to think that on this issue at least they are trying to stand up for what is the very best in western values. </p> <p>It must be entirely coincidental of course that the supine Quilliam Foundation is now being generously funded by the government. QF personnel are applying for even more sums of money from local authorities around the country under the Preventing Violent Extremism programme.</p> <p>It is hardly difficult to see why some warmongering elements in the government would want to promote the likes of the Quilliam Foundation, but it is an incredibly short-sighted policy. As the long-standing activist and now elected Respect councillor, Salma Yaqoob, has <a href=\"http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2008/9/20/are-they-really-preventing-extremism.html\">observed</a>, the message it sends out is a very damaging one:</p> <blockquote> <p>By denying the legitimacy of democratic opposition to government foreign policy from Muslims, and by promoting and recognising only those Muslims who toe the line, government policy is serving to strengthen the hands of the genuine extremists; those who say that our engagement in the democratic process is pointless or wrong ...</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>Our new immigration minister, Phil Woolas, has passed his time in parliament as an unremarkable New Labour apparatchik. Like many former presidents of the National Union of Students his career path doesn't seem to have been unduly held back by principle. But one thing has singled him out and that is a visceral line of rhetoric on race and immigration. The BNP have a big presence in his Oldham constituency and he apparently decided years ago that, while he would contest the BNP electorally, politically it was safer to pander to their views. On one occasion Woolas rushed to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/minister-calls-for-veilwearing-teaching-assistant-to-be-sacked-420313.html\">condemn a Muslim teacher</a> for wearing a veil (without waiting for the industrial tribunal finding).</p> <p>Now as immigration minister he has adopted a keynote rightwing policy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/immigrationpolicy-immigration\">setting a limit on immigration</a>. This is pernicious. People do not distinguish between asylum seekers, economic migrants, the dependents of people lawfully settled here and even bona fide British citizens (like the writer) who happen to be non-white. And, as Phil Woolas knows perfectly well, he has no power to stop people seeking asylum, which would be in breach of our obligations under the European convention on human rights. There is freedom of movement within the European Union so he cannot stem that flow of economic migrants. And British residents have the right to bring their wives and children in, whatever their colour. So for Woolas to raise expectations that he can somehow cap, or even reverse, the number of immigrants in the country is futile. </p> <p>Worse is the way that Woolas is peddling every rightwing half-truth about immigration. He claims that the government has \"to face up to voters' concerns about the level of immigration\". But the truth is that the government has done little else but pander to white fears on the subject. Since 1997 the government has passed seven separate pieces of legislation on immigration and nationality, all designed to make the system tougher. Woolas claims that it is \"too easy to get into this country\". Tell that to my constituents who wait years to be joined by their partners or dependents. Or explain this to the young children detained for months in detention centres for no other crime than being the offspring of asylum seekers. The truth is that the legislation has never been more draconian, and asylum seekers and would-be migrants have never had fewer rights. If the numbers of migrants continue to rise it is because of the \"pull factor\" of an (up until now) booming but deregulated economy sucking in cheap labour. And there has been a global rise in the millions seeking asylum from war, pestilence and famine. </p> <p>We all know that a recession <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/immigration-immigrationpolicy\">leads inexorably</a> to a rise in racism and xenophobia, but a cap on immigration is not the answer.</p>",

  "<p><strong>October 21 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong><br>The government was accused by shadow immigration minister Damian Green of being in \"chaos\" over the policy following a series of outspoken comments by immigration minister Phil Woolas. </p> <p>Green said Woolas had admitted that the government's policies had been \"a disaster\".</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, branded Tory immigration policy as a \"ragbag of half-baked ideas\". Later Woolas said it was important that the issue was debated without anyone's motives being questioned. He quipped: \"I suspect that it will not receive as many column inches as short interviews over the weekend but that is just the nature of the beast,\"</p> <p><strong>Small businesses</strong><br>Small businesses are facing the greatest threat Britain has seen for more than 70 years, the shadow business secretary, Alan Duncan, warned. He said the prognosis was \"dire\" and many firms were already predicting that economic pressures were going to \"drive them to extinction\". Duncan attacked the \"folly\" of Gordon Brown, who did not save money for the \"bad times\" during his decade-long reign as chancellor.</p> <p>Business minister Pat McFadden said: \"Faced with the threat of severe financial instability, this government has acted to restore stability to the banking system and in so doing we have protected the essential foundation upon which small and medium-sized businesses operate.\"</p> <p><strong>Thames estuary airport</strong><br>The transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, dismissed the idea of building a new airport in the Thames estuary as \"simply not practical\". He said environmental concerns and the risk of aeroplanes hitting birds were just two reasons why such a project could not go ahead.</p> <p><strong>knife crime in Cryodon</strong><br>The army should be drafted in to patrol the streets of a London borough to try to stop a spate of knife killings, independent Andrew Pelling (Croydon Central) urged. He called for the solution in a bid to prevent further deaths in his constituency and increase respect for the authorities. Croydon had a \"justified reputation\" as having the highest number of deaths caused by knives in the UK, he claimed.</p> <p><strong>Black Police Association</strong><br>The decision by the Black Police Association to discourage black and Asian people from joining the Metropolitan Police was an \"absolute disgrace\", Tory Philip Hollobone (Kettering) protested.

Howells lost his role as Middle East minister in this month's reshuffle. He takes over as chairman of the cross-party intelligence and security committee from former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, now housing minister.</p> <p><strong>Electrification of the Midland main line</strong><br>Hoon pledged to look \"very closely\" at the case for electrification of the Midland main line. Labour's Sir Peter Soulsby (Leicester S) said only by electrification could \"significant improvements\" be made to services on the route.</p> <p>The transport secretary, who represents Ashfield, said he took a \"close personal interest\" in the line, as a regular user of it. \"I certainly share my predecessor's enthusiasm for electrification.\"</p> <p><strong>Rail nationalistation</strong><br>Labour's Rob Marris (Wolverhampton SW) pressed the case for rail nationalisation, saying that to improve services and reduce congestion \"we should nationalise the railways - just as we are doing with the banks - by not renewing the franchises as they fall due\". Mr Hoon said: \"I'm sorry you take that view of the contribution made by train operating companies. I probably would, on balance, resist your invitation.\"</p> <p><strong>Non-jury inquests</strong><br>Government plans for non-jury inquests and \"specially appointed\" coroners, withdrawn from the counter-terrorism bill, came under renewed attack from Tories and Liberal Democrats. Security minister Lord West of Spithead confirmed last week that the withdrawn clauses would be included in legislation next session.</p> <p>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for Lib Dems, stressed the need for an independent coroner and jury for those shot dead by police or who had died in custody. \"It is critical for the confidence of society that it is not seen that it was some executive decision followed by an 'executive' inquest.\" For the Tories, Lord Kingsland, said: \"I share many of the hesitations expressed by Lady Miller.\"</p> <p><strong>Foreign seafarers' pay</strong><br>Ministers were urged to plug a legislative \"loophole\" that allows foreign seafarers, sailing between British ports, to be paid less than \u00a32 an hour. Labour's Gwyn Prosser (Dover) called for the \"exploitation\" to be ended by ensuring such workers were entitled to the minimum wage. Shipping minister Jim Fitzpatrick said: \"Any changes to minimum wage legislation would need to be consistent with international law. We are trying to address this question.\"</p> <p><strong>Driving instructors convicted of sexual offences</strong><br>A loophole allowing driving instructors convicted of sexual assaults to continue teaching pupils must be closed, Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie (Dunfermline and Fife W) demanded. His driving instructors convicted of sexual offences (suspension) bill would allow immediate suspension from the register of instructors convicted of sex attacks. It gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law.</p> <p><strong>Paul Myners</strong><br>City minister Paul Myners, former Marks and Spencer chairman, took his Lords seat.</p> <p><strong>NHS direct</strong><br>Each call made to NHS Direct last year cost the taxpayer more than \u00a325, it emerged. Figures disclosed by health minister Ben Bradshaw showed the average cost to the public purse of calls to the health advice line was \u00a325.53. With 4,858,000 calls in 2007-8, the total cost added up to \u00a3124,024,740.</p>",
  "<p>Today's votes on abortion make the case for a Europe-wide push to decriminalise abortion stronger than ever. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/health-abortionlaw-politics\">shameful</a> that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/health-health\">UK government announced yesterday</a> that it was not able to table three amendments to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/21/health-health1\">liberalise</a> Britain's abortion laws. One of these amendments sought to extend the rights of abortion to all UK citizens; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/northernireland-women\">women in Northern Ireland</a> still face prosecution for aborting even in cases of incest or rape.</p> <p>Access to abortion services across Europe is at best varied, at worst oppressive, misogynist and life-threatening. Abortion is in theory available in all of the EU member states except Andorra, Malta, Ireland and Poland. Yet the reality is often tempered by an absence of health facilities, lack of doctors willing to carry out abortions, repeated unnecessary medical consultations and lengthy waiting time for the procedure, all of which make access more difficult, or even impossible.</p> <p>Abortion in Europe falls under health provision, which is left to member states and something that the EU does not wish to rule on. However, access to healthcare when complications arise from a termination without fear of prosecution of either the patient or the clinician is an issue of European human rights. Women surely enjoy the fundamental freedom to be free from fear, threat and coercion as they deal with the consequences of rape and other grave human rights violations?</p> <p>These are not only my opinions but also those of the UN, the World Health Organisation, Amnesty International, the Council of Europe and the European parliament women's committee, all of whom have in recent years called for protections on a women's right to an abortion.</p> <p>This is an issue too important to be continually batted about across Europe in the never-ending game of left versus right, conservative versus liberal and religion versus secularism. Over the past 20 years countries across Europe have reversed, reinstated, liberalised and restricted abortions over and over again, often as a result of changes in government and religious influence, not as a result of scientific analysis.</p> <p>Poland reinstated some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe in 1993, following the collapse of communism and the resurgence of the powers of the Catholic and Lutheran churches. As a result of this, Polish NGOs estimate some 200,000 women endure backstreet abortions every year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, under the political radar of many, the government of <a href=\"http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/3772/context/archive\">Lithuania</a> is now seeking to create one of the most restrictive bans in all Europe. This is a country where abortion laws have changed little since independence and which has one of the lowest abortion rates amongst the Baltic nations. But if socially conservative parties win the upcoming election as predicted, Lithuanian women's access to abortion will be limited to only the most extreme cases of threat to life, criminality or severe disability.</p> <p>On the flip side, the centre-left Portuguese prime minister J\u00f3se S\u00f3crates has recently made moves to liberalise his country's abortion laws, which were previously some of the most restrictive in Europe. But this ruling is only dependent on his political status and could be reversed under a change in government. </p> <p>Where governments legislate to legalise abortion, women's rights to it are protected under European law. In a test case in March last year, the European court of human rights ruled to oblige all 46 member states of the Council of Europe to ensure that abortions are available where they are legal. An almost blind single mother of three from Warsaw, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/21/poland\">Alicia Tysiac</a>, was awarded damages by the Strasbourg-based court for being denied an abortion in 2000 when medical testimony said her pregnancy would seriously damage her failing eyesight.</p> <p>But important and helpful though this ruling is, it only protects European women who live in countries where abortion is legal. It does not apply in member states where abortion is outlawed. Pressure needs to be put on rulers of those countries by the EU to end these discriminatory laws which, incidentally, drive abortion dangerously underground.</p> <p>Previously, one of the best ways of putting pressure of EU member states' governments to change their laws on abortion was through the women's rights and gender equality committee of the European parliament, a committee on which I have sat since 2000. In 2002, this committee passed a report written by the Belgian Socialist MEP <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/committees/view.do?language=EN&amp;id=1938\">Anne Van Lancker</a>, recommending that in order to safeguard women's health, abortion should be made legal, safe and accessible to all. It also called on member state governments to refrain from prosecuting women who have undergone illegal abortions.</p> <p>Van Lancker produced a landmark report, which influenced many others, including the parliamentary assembly for the Council of Europe, which earlier this year recommended the decriminalisation of abortion across Europe. </p> <p>However, the face of the European parliament women's committee changed in 2004 with the election of rightwing, Catholic MEP <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/committees/view.do?language=EN&amp;id=23894\">Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1</a> to the chair of the committee. Now even small amendments calling for female prisoners to have the same access to abortions as their non-captive counterparts cannot get passed. Gone are the days when the women's committee could give active help to <a href=\"http://www.womenonwaves.org/\">Women on Waves</a>, the floating abortion ship which provides abortion services at sea to women from countries where abortion is not allowed.</p> <p>While abortion is generally a free vote in the UK, in Europe, parties vote fairly unanimously along party lines. All the rightwing parties in the European parliament, including the UK Conservatives, voted against section 13 of the van Lancker report, which called for the decriminalisation of women who have illegal abortions. They effectively voted to allow women to suffer from prosecution on top of the suffering they may have endured in having an illegal abortion.</p> <p>I hope those shouting for the rights of women outside the Palace of Westminster will also turn their faces and chants to Europe. Women across the continent are in desperate need of them to shout, protest and vote for their rights in the elections next year.</p>",
  "<p>In 1975 two books came from the Scottish universities. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/nov/05/scotlanddevolution.devolution\">Red Paper on Scotland</a> would establish the radical reputation of the student rector of Edinburgh, Gordon Brown; The Crime Industry by the Glasgow sociologist John Mack and his German co-author, Hans Juergen Kerner, would remain for specialists, with its argument that computers, tax havens and globalisation would blur the line between tough business practice and outright crime.</p> <p>Thirty years later, little remained of Brown's radicalism, but the Mack-Kerner thesis bobbed, iceberg-like, ahead of his economy, powered not by industry but by the speculation of the United Kingdom of London.</p> <p>\"Light-touch regulation\" stemmed from the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6081314.stm\">Big Bang</a> of 1986, codified by Brown's \"liberation\" of the Bank of England in 1997. From it followed the noughties boom in the City. This was driven by American investment bankers, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act\">Sarbanes-Oxley</a> refugees\" on the loose from a Wall Street increasingly regulated after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal\">Enron fraud</a>. They were able to operate unchecked by competing British regulators who rarely got their acts together.</p> <p>Investment banking shifted from handling the financing of industrial concerns to trading in \"derivatives\" and \"instruments\". Translated, this meant bundles of capital, some legitimate, some which had been inflated by loans to people who could never pay them off. Much of the last sort of finance had murky origins in the $1.3 trillion (and counting) returns of international crime. Bernard Shaw in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Warren's_Profession\">Mrs Warren's Profession</a> talked of the Church of England living on the profits of Mrs Warren's brothels. Brown was roughly in the same position, and for years he did little to remedy matters.</p> <p>In his study of money-laundering, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Washing-Machine-Laundering-Terrorist-Financing/dp/1587991594\">The Washing Machine</a>, Nick Kochan wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>London increasingly looks like an offshore centre serving many dubious financiers while at the same time claiming to have regulations which put it among the world's top onshore jurisdictions \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>Government has failed to invest in sufficient skilled law enforcement officers or regulators to curb its sprawling financial system. But this is no accident. The UK's economy cannot afford to curb its income from the \"invisible\" financial sector while its industrial sector becomes anorexic.</p> <p>The Tories haven't dissented, much of their funding coming from treasurer Michael Ashcroft's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/ashcroft/\">Belize ventures</a> and various spread-betting wheezes. Nice Mr Cameron has been the PR front man of fringe finance, no more than that. The winners have long cleared off to their tax havens. Look at the City matadors of the late Thatcher or Major age. Where are they now? Nowhere near the place.</p> <p>This was a culture in which fortunes were made selling packets of securities that only one or two nerds in a big bank could actually analyse. While the boom continued, happiness; when it failed \u2013 when actual houses in Phoenix or Greater Chicago couldn't be afforded and ground their 'owners' down \u2013 the derivative merchants clawed at one another in \"shorting\" the stocks of troubled firms.</p> <p>In September 2006 the Observer's Bill Keegan, last of the Keynesians, wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>All I can say is that at the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Singapore last month, one needed several hands to count the number of people who were concerned about the possibility/probability of a great Regulatory Failure! </p> </blockquote> <p>A year later, Northern Rock broke. The remedy: state intervention. In autumn 2007 Chancellor Alistair Darling threw a sum of money at the Rock that would have bought over the entire British railway system. He and Brown were therefore relatively practised when Wall Street hit its own iceberg and first Bear Stearns and then Lehman went down. The anticipation of slump spread from property to the entire economy and \"cut and run\" pervaded the dealers, to whom property had become a burden. So Halifax, the UK got hit.</p> <p>Brown thought he could do a deal with Lloyds TSB as Eric Daniels, its CEO (whose connections to Pinochet's Chile were as well-hidden as Brown's brother Andrew's position as chief PRO to Electricit\u00e9 de France, now owners of British Energy). But the City now tasted blood in the waters, like millions of potential house buyers in the suburbs who waited for their neighbour to drop the price of his place.</p> <p>Result: UK investment banking followed its American counterpart into palliative care. Brown intervened with some aplomb, having nothing to lose. Further, by smashing the Scottish banking system, he might turn humiliation at the hands of the Scottish nationalists into a personal triumph. Alex Salmond needed his old employer, the Royal Bank, as an ersatz foreign office, powering his Economic Advisory Council under Sir George Mathewson.</p> <p>So here we are in mid-October. Brown still fronts an economy in which only 14% comes from manufacturing, much lower than in Europe. Contributing little or nothing to renewable energy or sustainable transport, it is henceforth likely to contribute even less. Germany or France, with more invested in industry, and watching their market for Porsches, watches and cruise liners shrivel up, are still in the wings.<br> The whole thing might look \u2013 and the London press will make it look \u2013 like Scotland's second <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/07_july/01/darien_project.shtml\">Darien disaster</a>. But London's flawed financial elite stays in place \u2013 Stephen Hester, the new boss of RBS, is an iconic Tory Bourbon \u2013 and the condition of England has not improved. Industrial capital, however, remains powerful in Europe: the Norwegian oil fund, the manufacturing interests of the German regional banks. They must be appraising the offshore islands, matching decrepit infrastructure and disgraced management to energy potential.</p> <p>Brown didn't take the Scots with him in his City commitments, and their banks were done down by a capitalism all too close to the Mack-Kerner model. His solution, \"I value the Scottish banking tradition. I believe we can rebuild these banks' is shown up by Magnus Linklater's Times article as a lie: \"They are now British, not Scottish, banks and their future strategy will be determined from the City of London, not Edinburgh.\" And the City whose credulity, greed and incompetence got us into this? After Brown's intervention, and in the light of his past policies, the Scots owe neither him nor the UK any loyalty \u2013 and the bank layoffs and surrounding depression haven't even begun.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Kinnear has admitted he will need to remind Joey Barton of the need for calm under pressure as the controversial Newcastle United midfielder prepares to return from suspension against local rivals Sunderland on Saturday.</p> <p>The prospect of Barton starting his first game since his release from jail, where he was serving six months for assault, in the potentially tempestuous surroundings of a North-east derby is enough to make anyone apprehensive and Kinnear, the Magpies' interim manager, knows he could be asking for trouble if he does play him at the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>Although Barton, who proved his fitness playing for the reserves against Middlesbrough last night, made a brief substitute appearance at Arsenal back in August, he has not started a competitive game since he admitted to assaulting two people in a drunken rage in Liverpool last Christmas.</p> <p>The 26-year-old, who has served a six-match ban after he also admitted over the summer that he had attacked his former Manchester City teammate Ousmane Dabo following a training ground row in May 2006, was given a rough ride by supporters at the Emirates Stadium and was involved in an ugly exchange of tackles with the French winger Samir Nasri.</p> <p>He can expect to receive even worse abuse from Sunderland fans, while opposition players will also hope to provoke him into losing his temper. Kinnear, though, knows Barton must learn to control himself, even when antagonised, and the decision on whether to pick him will largely rest on the assurances he receives during a private meeting with the player.</p> <p>He said: \"Barton's in the running for sure, but it has gone through my head that such an intense fixture might be too much for him at this stage. I'll have a one-to-one with him, that's if I get a word in with him because he's a typical Scouser isn't he.</p> <p>\"Obviously, I have spoken to him about the importance of staying on the pitch against Sunderland because he trains as he plays believe it or not. I am going to sit down with Joey and explain that to him.\"</p> <p>There were concerted calls from Newcastle supporters for the club to sack Barton when he was jailed, but the player was backed by former manager Kevin Keegan. Given the threadbare nature of the squad he has inherited, Kinnear is relieved he did.</p> <p>He said: \"His fitness level is good and what has happened in the past with the lad is over and done with. I am only here to assess his ability as a player and he's a good player, he really is. He's got a big heart and is a good character. And on top of that he can play.\"</p>"
