  "<p>Zoe Heller's best-known book, Notes on a Scandal, was an exercise in the unreliable narrator, with all the information, including the information that undermined it, being given from a single point of view. Her new, fitfully brilliant novel The Believers tells its story from a wider spread of viewpoints, a more conventional approach that has a few wobbles of its own.</p> <p>The book starts with a prologue set in the London of 1962, charting the whirlwind courtship of teenager Audrey Howard and a visiting American, Joel Litvinoff, in his thirties. The narrative then jumps four decades and an ocean to resume in New York in 2002. Point of view can be a wonderfully flexible instrument. Here is Joel, now a celebrated radical lawyer, starting his day, stretching in front of a bedroom mirror: 'At 72, his nakedness was still formidable. His legs were strong. His chest, carpeted in whorls of grey hair, was broad. His penis was thick and long enough to bump companionably against his thigh as he strode out to the bathroom.' This might seem like a neutral description, but the too-adoring register suggests something different \u2013 that it is only the magic mirror of egotism which manifests this hunky senior.</p> <p>Such effects require careful control and smooth transitions between inner and outer perspectives. Heller has made things harder for herself by multiplying the points of view. Each viewpoint in a novel is like a bank of theatre lighting - by multiplying light sources, you can end up making the shadows disappear.</p> <p>At first, with Joel due to appear in court representing an Arab American accused of attending an al-Qaeda training camp, The Believers seems to promise a courtroom drama and an exploration of the conflict between pragmatism and principle. Audrey has become the family hardliner, opposing Joel's legal strategy (she feels he should be defending his client 'on grounds of legitimate Arab rage').</p> <p>In a successful piece of wrong-footing, the United States of America versus Mohammed Hassani disappears after the first chapter and Heller delivers a much more interesting book than the one she seemed to promise. On the other hand, it may take readers a little while to get their bearings when the book changes tack. It's as if the advertised symphony has been suddenly replaced by a piece of chamber music.</p> <p>Joel and Audrey may be the 'believers' of the title, but they aren't at the heart of the book. The emphasis is on the younger generation of Litvinoffs and the heavy price they pay for their parents' certainties. Karla, the older daughter, overweight and deemed to be gentle, has little hope of winning approval, though, perversely, her lowly standing in the family has only inflamed 'her ardour for the institution'.</p> <p>Rosa, on the other hand (presumably named for Rosa Luxemburg), tried for many years to be even more of an ideologue than her father. At one point, she denounced his sentimental fondness for Handel's Coronation Anthems: 'There's no such thing as aesthetic \"loveliness\" independent of politics and ideology, Dad.' 'Well, you know, Rosa, I've always said, self-contradiction is one of the occupational hazards of being an American progressive.'</p> <p>Heller is at her most confident and inventive in blackly comic passages showing the sisters' attempts to strike out on their own. Karla and her handsome husband Mike are trying to make a baby, an activity which can often kill the spontaneity of bedroom activity. It doesn't in their case because there was no spontaneity there to kill.</p> <p>Karla tries to think welcoming thoughts about Mike's incoming tadpoles, as the books recommend, but her low self-esteem sends the magic spell into reverse: 'The sperm who had set out so boisterously would grow languid and start to dawdle. Or vast mushroom-like fibroids would billow out from her womb, barring their way. Or the egg would turn out to be ensnared, like a fairy-tale princess, within an impassable thicket of endometrial scar tissue.'</p> <p>Rosa, meanwhile, explores her Jewish heritage with a sense of real discovery, though this may also be the only way she can broker an identity free of her angrily atheistic parents. Waiting to board the bus which will take her to an induction weekend, Rosa realises that although 'the outfit she had cobbled together for this occasion was modest enough to daunt the most lascivious gaze \u2026 she was in little danger of passing for an authentic, Orthodox woman. She looked like nothing so much as a mad Victorian governess trying to hide a skin disease.'</p> <p>There's one more family member, Lenny, an adopted son regarded in very different terms by the parents who have taken him in. For Joel, adoption was an exercise in radical justice, but the grown Lenny is a grotesque mess. Audrey's love for him, though, will never run out \u2013 she is emotionally committed in a way she isn't with her daughters. Oddly, Lenny's thoughts and emotions don't filter into the story. This isn't in the least a literary fault, since Lenny's character emerges with complete clarity \u2013 in fact it shows that a culling of viewpoints wouldn't have weakened the book. </p> <p>In other ways, though, Lenny feels tacked on, or developed in isolation. When he joined this amply dysfunctional family, aged seven, Lenny was much the same age as Karla \u2013 but there isn't so much as a ripple of sibling rivalry. If the book were a session of family therapy, then it would be a priority to put the sisters in touch with their anger, feelings at being displaced by a stranger who managed to tap into a great gusher of mother love in the backyard that was barren for them. In a novel, you can only feel that drafts haven't knitted fully together, to bring all of the book up to its high-level best.</p>",
  "<p>Elissa Wall can clearly remember her wedding day. She remembers the simple white dress made by her mother and sister, the sparkly tiara she wore in her hair and the ride she took in a horse-drawn carriage. But most of all, she remembers being 14 years old and trying her hardest not to cry.</p> <p>'I felt so hurt, so betrayed by these people I trusted,' she says now, eight years later. 'I was looking down at this pure white dress that should have been symbolic of a very happy moment in my life, a symbol of beautiful things and it was quite the opposite. To me, that dress was like a set of shackles being fitted.'</p> <p>She no longer has the dress. It was bagged up by police officers and used as evidence in the trial of the polygamist sect leader, Warren Jeffs, a man now serving between 10 years and life in Utah State Prison. It was Jeffs, the self-appointed head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, who forced the 14-year-old Elissa to marry her 19-year-old first cousin, Allen Steed, in 2001. And it was Jeffs who insisted, despite her tearful pleas, that she must submit to her husband 'mind, body and soul' in order to achieve godly salvation.</p> <p>For three years, Elissa, who had been raised within the FLDS to believe that marriage was the pinnacle of a woman's achievement, was routinely raped and sexually assaulted by her husband. By the age of 17, she had suffered four miscarriages and a stillborn child. At her lowest point, she attempted suicide with a handful of Ibuprofen pills.</p> <p>'I had been so sheltered, so closed-off,' she says when we meet in a cafe in Utah. 'I'd been taught to think of men as \"poisonous snakes\", so being exposed to marital relations was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. I probably had the innocence of a nine-year-old and that was brutally shattered. It broke a piece inside me that I don't think will ever be completely healed.'</p> <p>She escaped in the end, after falling in love with Lamont Barlow, a former member of the same church who persuaded her to leave her abusive marriage and set up home with him in the outside world. Freed of the beliefs that had once bound her, Elissa turned state witness against Warren Jeffs. Her evidence at his 2006 trial, given anonymously as 'Jane Doe IV', was enough to convict Jeffs of two counts of rape as an accomplice and sentence him to a minimum of 10 years in prison. It was only after his incarceration that Elissa felt safe enough to reveal her true identity and to write a harrowing memoir, Stolen Innocence, published in the UK this month.</p> <p>With the benefit of hindsight, the wedding photographs now make for disturbing illustrations. In most of them, Elissa's face is blotchy and swollen, her smile forced and uneasy. One of the pictures shows her wearing the embroidered white dress looking like a young girl playing dress-up, her youth accentuated by puppy fat. How does Elissa feel when she sees these pictures? She smiles and stares at her hands, fidgeting with the napkin in her lap as she talks.</p> <p>'People around me somehow wanted to fix this situation and they didn't know how, so they did the only thing that could make it seem good.' She looks up and the circles beneath her eyes are damp from tears. She rubs at the smudges of her eyeliner with her fingertips, apologising as she does so. 'I was so angry and hurt by those photos but now I realise that their intention in making me smile was to fix things. My mother was saying: \"You're going to be so happy someday and you're going to prize and cherish these photos,\" but for me, I felt caught in limbo between life and death.</p> <p>'My past seems almost surreal. It's like walking in someone else's footsteps and then you realise that, no, they're your own footsteps after all.'</p> <p>To meet Elissa now, aged 22 and the mother of two young children, you would have little inkling of her past. Superficially, she looks like a typical American soccer mom: straightened blonde shoulder-length hair, lip gloss and a dimpled smile. Patent scarlet stilettos peep out from the hems of her jeans. 'I just love red. We weren't allowed to wear red so when I came out, I bought so many red clothes, handbags - everything.'</p> <p>As a member of the FLDS, Elissa was expected to wear undergarments that covered every inch of flesh, from the wrist to the ankle and right up to the neck. She dressed in long-sleeved prairie dresses and grew her hair, pinning it into pioneer-style buns, believing that in heaven wives would be asked to use their hair to wash their husbands' feet. Tattoos, body piercing, make-up, modern music and television were all forbidden.</p> <p>Elissa grew up with 14 siblings and 10 half brothers and sisters. Her biological mother, Sharon Steed, was the second of her father's three wives. A typical day would involve rising before dawn and helping her mothers bake fresh bread before attending religious school where Warren Jeffs would read from the Book of Mormon each morning at 8am.</p> <p>'No matter what age you were, you were expected to attend and take notes. It was a very religious education. Every aspect of history was spun differently. They didn't believe in evolution and we were taught that dinosaurs came from a different planet. As a child in that society, you hung on every word. I remember believing in it so much it would almost consume me.'</p> <p>As far back as she can remember, Elissa was taught by Jeffs how to feel, speak, act and think. Her spare time was spent listening to cassettes of sermons delivered in Jeffs's hypnotic and insistent monotone. 'It was brainwashing,' she says. 'If you take a person, strip them of all identity, all emotions, then, yes, that's what it was.'</p> <p>The FLDS is one of the strictest religious sects in America, formed as a breakaway group after the Mormon Church officially abandoned polygamy in 1890. Its members believe that they are the chosen people who will be saved after the second coming of Christ and shun the 'evil' modern world. Highly secretive and insular, the sect operates primarily from four bases in Arizona, Utah, British Columbia and Texas.</p> <p>Plural marriage remains a central tenet - a man must take a minimum of three wives to reach the highest level of salvation - and the sect hierarchy leads by example. Rulon Jeffs, the church leader until his death aged 92 in 2002, is believed to have married 22 women, including two of Elissa's sisters, and fathered more than 60 children. His son, Warren, the current FLDS 'prophet' (viewed by the faithful as God on earth) is estimated to have more than 40 wives and some 56 children. Intermarriage and incest are rife: birth defects are viewed as evidence of a child having been especially blessed by God.</p> <p>In April this year, state authorities raided the FLDS 'Yearning for Zion' ranch in Eldorado, Texas after an anonymous tip-off that girls were being forced into underage marriage and teenage boys were being groomed to become adult abusers. More than 400 children were taken into temporary foster care but were returned six weeks later after the Texas Supreme Court ruled there was insufficient evidence of abuse.</p> <p>Although polygamy is illegal in the US, it is difficult to prosecute successfully because the FLDS faithful are rarely formally married according to state laws. This is why Elissa's testimony proved so earth-shattering: it enabled the authorities to pursue Warren Jeffs for arranging marriage to a girl under the age of legal consent, thereby becoming an accomplice to rape. It had wider ramifications too. Her court case shone a spotlight into the darkest corners of the FLDS, shattering the sect's conspiracy of silence.</p> <p>Elissa's testimony revealed that Jeffs was solely responsible for the practice of 'placing' young girls and women in marriages: each prospective union supposedly came to him through a revelation from God. Under his rule, the church leadership became noticeably stricter and the practice of marriage involving underage girls more frequent. One of his own wives was said to have been 12 years old. His power was such that if a husband proved to be unable to control his own family, Jeffs could simply reassign his wife and children to a new man.</p> <p>This is exactly what happened to Elissa's father. When he was deemed to have lost authority over his wives, Elissa, then 13, and her siblings were sent with their mother to live in a different family in order to bring them back into line. Elissa did not see her father for several years. Her new family was so large that meals had to be eaten in shift rotation. It was an experience she likens to the trauma of starting at a new school and being forced to get used to a new series of cliques and alliances.</p> <p>When her new 'father', Fred Jessop, informed her that she had been chosen by the prophet for marriage at the age of 14, she thus felt a curious mixture of terror and pride. 'I was completely shocked because there were so many girls in the home who were much older than me. But, crazy as it sounds, there was a little piece of me that thought, \"Wow, somebody finally noticed me\".'</p> <p>She had been brought up to be obedient and pious, to accept the prophet's word with unquestioning submission, and yet as the reality of her situation began to sink in, Elissa became increasingly distressed. Somewhere inside, she knew that what she was being asked to do was wrong.</p> <p>At a time when most adolescents are struggling to define the boundaries of their own identity, Elissa found herself buffeted against the ideology of an entire society. Her mind was conflicted. Although she still believed that becoming a wife and mother were the crowning achievements of a woman's life, she also felt, deep down, that she was too young to marry. Her own mother was powerless to step in: 'It's hard to explain why she just didn't pack me up and take me away,' Elissa says, 'but in her mind, making that step would have damned us both.'</p> <p>Forced into a position of isolation, she sought a meeting with Warren Jeffs to ask for two more years to prepare for marriage. For much of her childhood, Jeffs had been a remote and authoritarian figure, his spiritual omniscience underlined by his imposing 6ft 4in stature. Elissa remembers him as 'having these eyes that bore clear through into your soul. I honestly believed he could read my mind. We feared him greatly.</p> <p>'As a person, he was creepily quiet, methodical, and a very good speaker. He reminds me of many past world leaders who are able to convince entire countries to do horrible things. He was extremely narcissistic and sometimes I honestly think he believed he was God.'</p> <p>Jeffs was unmoved. He insisted that it was her 'mission and duty' to get married. 'It was very painful when I realised that no one was going to take account of how I felt,' she says. 'After a week of pleading and crying on my knees I realised this train was going to keep on going down the track at 100mph. Something inside me died.' In April 2001, during an FLDS ceremony conducted by Jeffs, Elissa was bound to her new husband 'for time and all eternity'.</p> <p>In the years that followed, her husband, Allen, routinely forced her to have sex. When she sought help from church elders, she was advised to submit and 'keep sweet' like a dutiful wife should. She suffered her miscarriages in silence, guiltily assuming that they were her punishment for her insubordination.</p> <p>She has little sympathy for Allen, even though he was barely adult himself. 'For me, as a child, he was very sexually abusive. I'm sorry for him that he was placed in that situation but he was much older than me and every human being knows right from wrong and he knew, without a doubt. He chose to hurt me in that fashion. That was his choice personally.'</p> <p>Over the three long, lonely years that followed, she sank deeper into depression, eventually choosing to spend the nights sleeping in her car rather than go home to face the daily sexual ordeal that awaited her. 'There was a feeling of compounded trauma and pain. I didn't have anywhere to go and I was still so young in mind, body and soul. I get emotional still now when I talk about it because I can't imagine going through it.'</p> <p>Estranged from her father and unable to confide in her mother, Elissa found herself alone until a chance meeting with young man called Lamont Barlow, an FLDS member who was having his own run-ins with the church hierarchy. They fell in love and, in 2005, ran away from the church.</p> <p>At first, life on the outside came as a profound shock. Not only did Elissa have no idea what clothes to wear but she had hardly ever heard pop music, watched television or, incredibly, seen a black person. Because the FLDS operated its own financial system - whereby members pay into a central fund - neither Elissa nor Lamont had any idea of how to organise a mortgage or negotiate a salary. They had been taught to view the outside world as evil and damned - Elissa remembers being 'shaken to the core' when she first met a stranger who was nice to her in a grocery store. But her sense of loss coexisted with another, more penetrating feeling, of anger.</p> <p>'This intense, burning, consuming anger affected my daily life for a while. Then I realised that by being angry I was allowing them to control my life. It's not that I'm not angry any more, but it's that I needed to get past it because it's so exhausting to carry it with you everywhere you go.'</p> <p>When she decided to testify against Warren Jeffs, the pressures became even more intense. Jeffs went on the run and as news leaked out of her betrayal, members of her own family started phoning her to persuade her to change her mind. There were anonymous threats and intimidation. Inside the compound, the church faithful were encouraged to pray for Elissa's destruction. She and Lamont were forced to enter a witness protection scheme in July 2006.</p> <p>'We never knew if we were going to be in the same place that night. We moved many, many times from a hotel to a safe house to an apartment. We're still in witness protection now. We have different identities and people don't know where we live or how to get hold of us.'</p> <p>Why did she decide to testify? 'I wanted my voice to be heard. It's not just about me. My two younger sisters [Sherry, 17, and Ally, 14] are still in the FLDS and I haven't had any contact with them for three years. They have been my inspiration and my deepest pain. I don't want to see them go through what I did.'</p> <p>Jeffs, who had been on the run from criminal charges for more than four months, was finally arrested in August 2006 by a Nevada state trooper. He was travelling in a red Cadillac found to contain $54,000 in cash, 15 mobile phones, three iPods, laptop computers, a police scanner, a stack of credit cards and two female wigs, one blonde and one brunette. In prison, Jeffs lost none of his authority or his power to terrify: because they are not allowed access to television or newspapers, many FLDS members continue to know nothing of his incarceration.</p> <p>During his two-week trial in September 2007, Elissa remembers being 'extremely overwhelmed. I still had to realise that no, he was not God on earth. Those first seconds when I took the stand and looked Warren Jeffs in the eye were the most scary, most painful, but also the most liberating seconds in my life. I was able to see him and truly feel freedom from him. It was like taking a deep breath and feeling a thousand times lighter.'</p> <p>After his conviction, Elissa refused the financial compensation offered by the court on the grounds that it would have come from the pockets of the FLDS faithful. She is, however, pursuing a $1 million civil action against Jeffs and the church in order to establish a foundation for girls who, like her, are forced into underage marriage and have nowhere to turn.</p> <p>In Texas earlier this year, she was asked by police investigators to help liaise with FLDS members and, to her dismay, found further evidence of paedophilia going unchecked.</p> <p>'Many children are in grave danger,' she says. 'They don't have a normal life and they're not allowed to be children. When they went into that compound, they found no toys. As painful as it may be to see those women and children traumatised by their separation, there is a need for protection wherever abuse occurs. It absolutely must be investigated and stopped.'</p> <p>Part of her strength of feeling comes from having children herself - Tyler, three and Emily, one - and I wonder whether motherhood has made her question the actions of her own mother, who stood silently by while her teenage daughter was sexually abused. Elissa has not seen her mother, who still belongs to the FLDS, for three years. What would she say to her if she got the chance?</p> <p>'How much I love her and feel sorry for her,' she says, with a sad smile. 'I hope she knows I've stayed true to myself and that, for once, she should be proud of me. She had no control over what happened to me but she used to say to me every single day that evil flourishes when good men do nothing. That's what helped me get through this.'</p> <p>She finishes her cappuccino and places the cup carefully back on the saucer. For all that Elissa has been through, she seems finally to have reached her own fragile truce with the past. She smiles as she walks away and her bright red shoes click-clack into the distance; one final small act of defiance.</p>",
  "<p>Returning to work part-time in retirement is one of the most talked-about trends in the workplace; not only does it give people a role to play in the community again, it also provides them with a valuable second income. </p> <p>But, all too frequently, the growing numbers of fifty- and sixtysomethings take home little more than 'pocket money'. Government statistics show that part-timers (which most older workers are) earn only 64 per cent of what full-timers get per hour, and pay slumps significantly after people pass the age of 49. To add insult to injury, women in this age group still earn much less than men, with the gender pay gap at 20 per cent for people in their fifties and 15 per cent for workers in their sixties. The Equal Pay Act has been in place for 38 years, but the gender pay gap still averages 17 per cent across all age groups. </p> <p>The Employment Equality Age Regulations will have been operating for two years next month, but we will probably have to wait several years more before the age pay gap narrows. </p> <p>The problem with discrimination is that we often commit it subconsciously. Just as it used to be acceptable to pay women less when men were seen as the main breadwinners, it may now be vaguely acceptable to pay less to older people who no longer have children to support. And Gordon Brown's focus on 'hard-working families' arguably marginalises people who fall outside this group, such as part-timers without children. His encouragement of volunteering among over-fifties may also have subtly undermined, in the eyes of employers, the rights of older people to equal pay. </p> <p>Certainly, many fiftysomethings see their pay prospects reduced by age. Fred (not his real name), who is 59, says his age 'is a tremendous disadvantage'. A journalist, he reached his earnings peak at 41, when he was paid about three times the average wage. Now, after periods of illness and working freelance, he is on benefits while he retrains as a debt adviser. </p> <p>'Whatever the law says, there is a feeling that employers won't look at you when you're much over 40,' he says. 'If I went into the private sector, potential managers would be saying about me: \"He's older than me, better qualified than me, he'd be an embarrassment\".' </p> <p>Fred's old school friends are similarly descending into under-achievement: a computer expert has become a driver and a leading technician in his field is trying to get a job as a clerk. </p> <p>However, in very specific areas, older workers may still be able to get good jobs and high pay. Half the top people in the oil and gas sector are due to resign in the next five years, according to the Association of Executive Search Agents, which says there is an extreme shortage of talent due to lack of foresight and training in the early 1980s and the retirement of baby boomers. </p> <p>Job-seekers over the age of 50 need to start by looking confident and showing initiative, says marketing consultant Steve Manton. And they need to be assertive when discussing pay. 'You need to set the price for the job at the start of the relationship,' he says. Employers would normally have in mind a salary range they would pay for a new recruit, from \u00a323,000 to \u00a326,000, for instance. Making your case for getting the top end of the range would show initiative, says Manton, and would obviously set your base pay at the top end of the scale for all the time you worked for that employer. </p> <p>Richard Lynch, negotiating officer for the Unite trade union, says: 'An awful lot of people say to themselves: \"I have been doing this job for years, it's not a big job and I am a small, little person.\" Then if they get redundancy, it's a huge blow to their self-confidence.' But if they can get someone else - an outplacement consultant, preferably - to help them work out what their actual skills are, they could get a better pay package in the next job. </p> <p>Big employers with formalised pay structures often pay more for particular skills, and smaller employers can sometimes be persuaded to do the same. Ken Mulkearn of Incomes Data Services advises people to research salaries in the sector they are applying to from the websites of trade unions, employer bodies, the Office for National Statistics and research companies such as his own. Having such information at your fingertips shows gumption - and good employers should like that. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Useful contacts: <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk\">www.tuc.org.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.incomesdata.co.uk\">www.incomesdata.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk\">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk\">www.cbi.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The story sounds at first like an episode in one of the lurid soap operas the Middle East is so addicted to: a beautiful Lebanese pop star stabbed to death in her luxury Dubai apartment by a hitman hired by a powerful Egyptian tycoon. </p> <p>But the drama is a real-life one, with its gory details recounted in the Arab media. The wealthy Egyptian is a property dealer, Hisham Talaat Moustafa, closely linked to the political elite surrounding the family and party of President Hosni Mubarak. And the victim was a popular 30-year-old singer, Susanne Tamim. </p> <p>As the story has unravelled, it has cast an unflattering light on the relationship between money and power in Egypt. Moustafa, 49, is a top ruling party official close to Mubarak's influential son, Gamal. He is a member of the National Democratic party's supreme policies council and deputy chairman of the economic committee of the Shura Council, the upper house of Egypt's parliament. </p> <p>In the past 10 years he has become one of Egypt's billionaire elite, owner of luxury hotels and beach resorts and a leading force in building Cairo's Western-style upper-class suburbs.</p> <p>Now he is in jail, charged with paying a security guard $2m to have Tamim murdered and faces a possible death sentence if found guilty. The body of Tamim, who became famous after winning a television talent show in Lebanon in 1996, was found in her Dubai flat in July. She had multiple stab wounds and her throat had been cut. Recently, her career had been plagued with marital problems and legal wrangles. She had separated from her Lebanese husband-manager, who filed lawsuits against her. Her last hit song was called 'Lovers' and was dedicated to the memory of the assassinated Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri. </p> <p>The arrest of Moustafa came as a shock for many Egyptians who have long been convinced that their government would not meddle with influential businessmen who are regarded as effectively beyond the law. That particular view seemed to have been strengthened by recent events. When Moustafa's name first appeared in media reports weeks ago, he denied any role in the affair and complained on Egyptian television that the rumours about him were damaging the economy. The government responded by promptly banning press reports on the murder, suggesting that Moustafa was indeed off limits.</p> <p>But on Tuesday, Egypt's public prosecutor accused Moustafa of taking out a $2m contract for Tamim's murder with Mohsen el-Sukkary, a former Egyptian state security officer. Moustafa was accused of taking part in the murder 'through incitement, agreement and assistance ... in killing the victim in revenge. He provided [Sukkary] with special information and amounts of money'.</p> <p>El-Sukkary worked at Cairo's Four Seasons Hotel, which is owned by Moustafa. The prosecutor said that the businessman helped to obtain visas and tickets for the hitman as he trailed the singer first to London, then to Dubai. Tamim had moved to Dubai, friends say, to break off her relationship with Moustafa, a married man. </p> <p>According to Dubai investigators, el-Sukkary stalked the singer on the morning of 28 July to her apartment in the Dubai Marina complex, overlooking a harbour full of yachts. From the lobby, he rang her video intercom, showing her an ID of the management company from which she had recently bought the apartment. She buzzed him in, police say.</p> <p>Once inside the flat he stabbed her repeatedly with a knife, then shed his overalls and cap, dumping them in a rubbish bin outside the building, the officials said. They were found by police and tested for DNA. Police say that the killer's face also appeared on security camera footage. On Thursday, Egypt's independent Al-Masri Al-Youm newspaper published transcripts of alleged telephone conversations kept by el-Sukkary and seized by the police. In one of those calls, Moustafa says that 'the agreed amount is ready' and tells the security man: 'Tomorrow she is in London and you should act.' In a later tape, el-Sukkary explains that he missed his chance in London and 'will wait to move it to Dubai'. Moustafa chides him at first and then says: 'OK, let's finish with this.'</p> <p>A senior Egyptian police official, speaking to the Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity, confirmed the transcript, because those investigation details had not been officially released.</p> <p>While other wealthy businessmen close to the ruling National Democratic party in Egypt have escaped prosecution on crimes ranging from corruption to manslaughter, the unexpected speed of the moves against Moustafa reflect the growing political discontent over the influence wielded by businessmen who dominate the government and their apparent immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>Earlier this year, there was widespread public anger when the millionaire owner of a ferry company was acquitted of negligence in a case that involved a Red Sea ferry which sank in 2005 with the death of 1,000 people.</p> <p>Pressure from Dubai also appears to have played its part in the decision to strip Moustafa of his immunity from prosecution and arrest him.</p> <p>Mustafa el-Said, the chairman of the People's Assembly Economic Committee, told Al-Ahram Weekly last week that the speed of the indictment signalled a desire to send a message to the country's business elite that its cosy relationship with those in power may be coming to an end. 'The NDP is sending the message that it will not tolerate criminal practices from businessmen, regardless of who they are or how much money they give to fund the party.'</p>",
  "<p>Up and down the country there are harvest festivals and late summer flower shows taking place in church and town halls. If there was one in the area I would be submitting my dahlias and some produce from the allotment, just for the joy of the gathering together of all those different passions and peoples. Yard-long leeks from old-timers and unnaturally straight runner beans mark the seriously competitive, as do the onions with beautifully turned over tops artfully tied with string. There are pears of all shapes and sizes, and melons that mark how good the summer has been - or not. Unblemished damsons scent the air, their powdery bloom bearing not the slightest fingerprint, and single-stem hybrid roses, as old-fashioned and immaculate as Fifties hats, sit alongside chrysanthemums with petals groomed into position. In contrast, and for those of us a little less interested in perfection, bunches of 'Mixed Garden Flowers' reveal the contents of their owners' gardens, with each as particular as handwriting.</p> <p>There is something pagan about the gathering of the summer's produce and the joy in the harvest. It must have been celebrated in some shape or form for as long as we have been cultivating ground. The feeling runs deep and I have been living it several times over since the spring. First it was with the mustards (frilly red and green, giant red and giant green), the mizuna and red pak choi in the salad beds. These were sown with the lettuce as soon as the ground was warm enough in April. The oriental greens were in the salad bowl little more than a month later, showing up the lettuce as a dawdler. I have been struggling to keep up with them ever since. Re-sowing short rows every three weeks has kept us in good supply and I am just about to sow my last crop in the hope that I can keep them under cloches and enjoy some greens well into autumn. I will be minding the slugs now that the garden is providing them with a multitude of hiding places. </p> <p>Next were the elderflowers turned into cordial. We missed our chance due to a busy week when they were at their best on the fringes of the cemetery, so friends brought a bucketful up from the country. It sat in the pantry for 24 hours, steeping with sugar, lemon and citric acid and scenting the whole of the kitchen before it was strained through muslin and bottled. Though I have yet to try it, I wonder if the liquorice-leaved elder Sambucus 'Black Lace' will produce pink syrup to match the tone of its flowers? Next year I will try to persuade the friends who are trialling the plant I don't have room for to part with some. Bartering is the order of the day and they will get a bottle of the nectar in return for the favour. </p> <p>It took a while for things to come to fruition on the allotment because I had to wait for the green manure crop to decompose after I turned it in in March. This meant that I was a whole month late putting my spuds in, but of course they caught up. I used two blight-resistant varieties, 'Lady Cristl' - a perfect, waxy tuber - and 'Robinta' - much less space hungry in its top growth and a little later, it is mealy in comparison to 'Lady Cristl', but marvellous for soaking up lashings of butter. There is nothing quite like that moment when you turn up the first spuds of the season, the dirt coming away from the pale, unblemished fruit. We ate a whole bowlful of that first harvest with nothing more than butter and sea salt.</p> <p>I planned ahead with several winter brassicas that were sown in early June, but I got the timing completely wrong as, by the time all the spuds came out, the brassicas were far too big to transplant to the newly cleared ground. The Russian kale was the fastest and we simply ate it early along with the broccoli tops and the 'Cavolo nero' in salads or lightly steamed. I then re-sowed further rows to plant up for winter. I am now hoping that my timing doesn't work against me, because I would like the pleasure of passing by the greens at the market for at least some of the coming winter. The leeks were better behaved and were perfectly sized for planting out (pencil thickness) alongside the greens, but it was a close thing, with the courgettes threatening to take over the nursery bed, reaching out their great fleshy limbs like giants stretching in the morning.</p> <p>In the herb bed things soon got out of control and, to resolve the spread of the sage, we harvested all the tips of one of the three plants and made it into pesto. I have done this with sorrel to fashion a tart garnish for fish, but the sage pesto was a very good compliment to a well done pork chop. Despite the cool summer, cosseting in the cold frame also gave me enough basil to convert into pesto, which was given a spicy undertone by the red- and green-leaved 'Violetto Aromatico' from Seeds of Italy (<a href=\"http://www.seedsofitaly.com/product/279\">seedsofitaly.com/product/279</a>), which has a peppery punch with a hint of clove and is the best thing in blog.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For regular updates on our allotment's progress, pictures and slideshows, and to share your gardening comments, questions, recipes and advice, visit <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/allotment\">blogs.theguardian.com/allotment</a></p>",
  "<p>Chardonnay is the most famous vine variety of all. Wine drinkers find it flatteringly easy to enjoy, vine growers find it easy to grow, and winemakers revel in the range of different winemaking techniques to which the grape readily submits: not just a wide range of dry white wines with more weight than most, but delicate sparkling wines and even a few extremely successful sweet white wines made with the benefit of \"noble rot\".</p> <p>All over the world, producing chardonnay is a rite of passage in new wine regions, and the grape is nothing if not adaptable. In hot regions, it can produce tropical fruit flavours; in cooler ones, apple-crisp tingle juice which, in less ripe years, can have rapier\u2011like acidity.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>In more temperate climates, chardonnay can yield some of the finest dry white wine in the world - and some very fine fizz, as in the Champagne region. The heartland of Burgundy, the Cote d'Or, is the nerve centre of this style: savoury, dense, the grape a medium through which different vineyards (and winemakers) can communicate their individual styles, often only after many years in bottle. Hazelnuts, liquorice, lemon, smoke, butter, spice are just a few of the many aromas that can develop in these full-bodied wines. Montrachet, Puligny-Montrachet, Chassagne-Montrachet, Meursault and Corton-Charlemagne are some of the most famous names.</p> <p>White Burgundy is made with exasperatingly varied levels of skill, so that one winemaker's Bourgogne Blanc, the most basic appellation, may be better than another's Montrachet, even though it costs a fraction of the price. The name of the producer is often more important than the appellation. The wines of Chablis, one of France's coolest wine regions, have a very particular flavour, reminiscent of wet stones, with some suggestion of very green fruit, but without the strong aroma and lean build of a sauvignon blanc. The Maconnais tends to produce a more new world style of chardonnay: plump, open wines that can taste of melon, or apples warmed by the sun. Chardonnay grown between the Maconnais and the Cote d'Or in the Cote Chalonnaise tends to taste somewhere between the two. Chardonnay's influence has been spreading within France as elsewhere - from the Loire to the Languedoc. </p> <h2>North America</h2> <p>Chardonnay has become synonymous with white wine in California, responsible for an ocean of off-dry, golden, easy\u2011to-drink liquid. The key to serious quality is climate. Wherever coastal fogs slow down the ripening process and keep yields in check, California can produce some very fine chardonnays, with considerable Burgundian savour but without the old world surliness in youth. The variety is grown almost everywhere in North America where it has half a chance of thriving. </p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>Australia's strong suit is the reliable quality and varied character of its middle-range chardonnays, their fruitiness being increasingly checked by more refined winemaking. Cooler areas can make examples more reminiscent of Cote d'Or wine. Tasmania makes the leanest, while the Adelaide Hills, Yarra Valley and southern vineyards of western Australia can all make top-quality chardonnays, but newer, cooler regions - notably in New South Wales - are being scouted and planted all the time. </p> <h2>New Zealand</h2> <p>Australian producers may envy the high acid levels that their counterparts in New Zealand can hardly avoid, but New Zealanders have become rather blase about their widely planted chardonnay vines. Winemaking standards have been varied, but those prepared to restrain yields and oak influence can produce subtle, sometimes exciting wines. Gisborne chardonnay has long had its followers, but there have been dramatic examples from wineries all over the North and South Islands.</p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>Chardonnay is more widely distributed than any other grape variety - even more widely than its red wine counterpart, cabernet sauvignon, which needs more sunshine to ripen it. South Africa can produce some of the world's best-value chardonnay, its Antarctic influence adding a natural crispness relatively rare in non-European examples. The vineyards of South America have also been invaded by this grape, the most promising examples so far coming from the coolest regions. Casablanca Valley, San Antonio and the odd site in Bio-Bio have made the best wines so far in Chile, while the high-altitude Valle de Uco in Mendoza, Argentina, has shown it can produce very fair copies of California's top chardonnays at a fraction of the price. In the old world, Spain and Portugal have relatively limited plantings. Oaked chardonnays have found huge admirers in Italy, though much of the fruit here is siphoned off for the spumante (sparkling) industry.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore's recommendations</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong><br> <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer Bourgogne Chardonnay 2006, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a37.99, M&amp;S</strong></p> <p>Beautifully steady and alive, like sunlight on a late summer's afternoon, this basic-level white Burgundy has had 10 months in French oak and wears it well. Creamy yet refreshing, it drinks well both with and without food.</p> <p><strong>One to lust after</strong></p> <p><strong>Cape Chamonix Chardonnay Reserve 2006, South Africa</strong> <br><strong>\u00a313.95, Swig (<a href=\"http://www.swig.co.uk\">swig.co.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>One of the most impressive South African whites I've tasted, this is <br>closely textured, aged in new French oak, and has a nutty, toasty nose. Despite its generosity, there is a Burgundian touch to it - and you'd certainly <br>struggle to find anything from Burgundy with so much tightly packed flavour at this price.<br><strong>Victoria Moore</strong></p> <h2>Drink with</h2> <p>The ultimate way to kick off a special occasion is with a glass of blanc de <br>blancs champagne and plump, freshly shucked oysters served with a squeeze of lemon or, better still, au naturel. If the budget doesn't stretch to France, no problem \u2014 there are cheaper sparkling wines from <br>around the world that will work just as well. As for chardonnay without bubbles, the leaner, more focus ed examples now available are better <br>suited to food than the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" wines that put <br>so many of you off. Piping hot oven aside, a chicken stuffed with lemon, <br>butter, garlic, salt, pepper and fresh thyme is all you need to create <br>chardonnay heaven. You need the rich, sweet fruit and spicy oak to match the flavour of the bird, the weight and length to carry the flavour, and the acidity to cut through fat and clean your palate.<br><strong>Matt Skinner</strong></p> <p><em>Champagne is the only wine that leaves a woman beautiful after <br>drinking it </em><br><strong>Madame de Pompadour</strong></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will whisk his entire cabinet off to Birmingham tomorrow to launch a 'manufacturing strategy', and remind them there is life outside the capital, where the credit crunch has caused thousands of City job losses and induced profound economic gloom.</p> <p>Manufacturing, all too easily written off as outmoded or dull, has rarely been high among Labour's priorities, and has not evinced grand-sounding measures such as the 'high-level group on city competitiveness' Brown established when he was Chancellor to safeguard the interests of London's financial services firms.</p> <p>But if there is the faintest glimmer of a silver lining to the coming economic downturn, it is that manufacturing may begin to command more interest from policymakers whose faith in the power of the City has been shaken, and that the sharp downward slide in the value of the pound should give Britain's exporters a very welcome fillip.</p> <p>Holidaymakers returning to these chilly shores will already have noticed the marked weakening of the pound, as they totted up the cost of their travels; but sterling has taken another lurch downwards in the past fortnight, given extra momentum by Alistair Darling's controversial claim from his croft in the Hebrides that the economic situation is now at its worst for 60 years.</p> <p>Veteran currency traders quip that the pound tends to go 'up the stairs and down the escalator': in other words, when it does weaken, it can happen very rapidly. Nevertheless, many analysts have been surprised at the violence of the sell-off. Since last autumn, the pound has lost 15 per cent of its value against the currencies of Britain's major trading partners.</p> <p>'Sterling's paying a bit for the honesty of the policymakers - Alistair Darling and Mervyn King have been quite blunt about the chances of recession,' says Steve Barrow of Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, believes sterling's slide is one of the few reasons for optimism in these dreary times. 'It is a bright spot, insofar as we have all been saying for years that a lower exchange rate was probably a necessary condition for a decent rebalancing of the economy, away from an excessive reliance on consumer spending, and towards exports,' he says.</p> <p>Certainly, amid the pessimism, industry surveys show confidence holding up better in the manufacturing sector than among battered retailers or estate agents. The latest quarterly assessment by EEF, the engineering employers' federation, shows that its members are still seeing strong export orders, helping to offset the collapse in domestic demand.</p> <p>For several years, economists - and Bank of England governor Mervyn King - have warned that sterling is overvalued, making exporters' lives extremely tough and helping the pound in consumers' pockets to buy more cut-price goods from overseas.</p> <p>Presenting the Bank's quarterly inflation report last month, King said it was 'not surprising that a country which has seen rapid growth of domestic demand and a large trade deficit, to which we've pointed for many years, that at some point that would lead to an adjustment in the exchange rate - and I think that's probably what's happened'.</p> <p>He predicted that the weaker exchange rate would help to boost exports, and 'rebalance' an economy that has been skewed towards consumer spending. The question is whether, after decades of grinding attrition, Britain's manufacturers have the skills, the capacity or the financing to rise to their more competitive position.</p> <p>David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says manufacturing has been unloved for many years, as employment in the sector has slipped from more than five million in the early 1980s to under three million today: 'It's not just this government; this has gone on since the 1980s. There's been this absolute fascination with the services sector. I have argued for a long time that the economy is out of balance. We need a strong manufacturing base.' </p> <p>Brown and his colleagues could hardly have chosen a better city for their first cabinet day trip. Birmingham offers a microcosm of the shifting character of Britain's economy. Its biggest employer was once the Longbridge plant, home of British car brand Rover. In the 1970s, it was the backdrop for bitter battles between employers and unions, led by Derek Robinson, or 'Red Robbo', as he was known. Thirty years later, as Longbridge tottered, Stephen Byers, the then trade and industry secretary, desperate to save the last British-owned carmaker, backed an ill-fated rescue plan by a consortium known as the Phoenix Four.</p> <p>Rover finally collapsed in 2005, and Longbridge closed with the loss of 6,000 jobs. As if to underline the changing power balance in the world economy of the 21st century, the remnants of the firm were bought up by Chinese company Nanjing Automotive, which shipped much of the production line to China. Longbridge reopened this year, to produce high-specification MG sports cars, but the plant's new owner expects to employ 250 people, a far cry from its mass production heyday.</p> <p>Even as Birmingham's reputation as the home of British carmaking waned, however, the city experienced an impressive regeneration, with smart canal-side apartments and the striking Bull Ring shopping centre, home to branches of Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.</p> <p>This tale has been repeated all over the country, as manufacturers have found themselves unable to compete with cheaper rivals in China, India and other emerging markets, or with the technical prowess of Germany and Japan, which have remained formidable exporters. </p> <p>If the cheaper pound is really to prompt a manufacturing renaissance then it will take time. There are not hundreds of mothballed factories waiting for someone to switch on the lights and start the machines humming again; an army of skilled workers has found other roles and top-flight graduates have often aspired to City salaries, instead of running a business making widgets.</p> <p>So far, there has been little evidence of strengthening exports, despite the fact that the pound has been declining for almost a year. But Martin Weale, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, says history suggests there will eventually be significant economic benefits.</p> <p>'The experience of earlier exchange-rate adjustments has been that, while the timing of an export boost is not certain, market forces do work in the end,' he says. 'The recent fall of sterling adds to the competitive edge which Britain has gained.' He says that each 10 per cent decline in sterling tends to increase economic output by half a percentage point the following year, so the 15 per cent depreciation we have now had should give GDP a much-needed 0.75 per cent boost in 2009.</p> <p>This could be a crucial extra prop to demand over the next couple of years, as other sources of growth, such as consumer spending, crumble in the face of the house price crash. Certainly, there are already many quiet manufacturing success stories, often under the wing of foreign ownership.</p> <p>It may be good news for exporters, but the shift in the pound also complicates the dilemma facing King and his colleagues at the Bank. After cutting interest rates three times in the early months of the credit crunch, they have refrained from making further reductions, despite the flood of bad news, fearing that inflation, which has shot up to 4.4 per cent - more than double the government's 2 per cent target - will run out of control.</p> <p>Sterling's slide adds an extra complication, because it will push up the price of buying imported goods and raw materials, which could boost inflation yet further in the short term. Clothing retailers have already warned that if the pound continues to weaken they may have to follow food stores in making sharp price increases over the next 12 months.</p> <p>However, higher costs only become inflationary if retailers can make those price rises stick, and the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee - led by economist David Blanchflower - believe the economy is already slowing so rapidly that inflation will not take hold.</p> <p>After the pound plunged out of the European exchange rate mechanism in autumn 1992, its value dropped sharply, but inflation remained contained, because the economy was already deep into recession.</p> <p>Weale argues that the decline in the pound will be better medicine for UK plc than the cuts in interest rates demanded by many business groups. 'The economy needs an upturn in export demand rather than a revival of consumer demand and the prospects for this are considerably better than they were only a few weeks ago,' he says.</p> <p>With the downturn that began in the US housing market increasingly manifesting itself in the euro zone, and a growing number of emerging economies contributing to the tough backdrop Darling is so concerned about, any improvement in manufacturers' fortunes is likely to be gradual and hard won. But if the decline in sterling is really the long-term adjustment King and others hope for, perhaps for once the Square Mile may not be the most exciting place in Britain's economic landscape.</p> <h2>North east optimist: but help is needed</h2> <p>Mohan Emmanuel of biotechnology firm Implants International, which makes replacement knees and hips, says it's about time firms like his won more attention from the government. 'Manufacturing for the last 15 years hasn't been considered sexy: the ethos of the service-driven economy has been at the forefront of everyone's minds.'</p> <p>Employing 36 people in the north east, Emmanuel says a weaker pound would certainly help him to sell more implants to the US and European markets. 'It's a good thing for Britain: please God may it be maintained,' he says.</p> <p>'Over the last years, the weakness of the dollar has had a significant effect on our stability vis-a-vis our US sales. The weakening of the pound against the dollar will help - and against the euro, too.'</p> <p>Despite the slowdown in the US and Europe, he anticipates continued strong growth. 'Our products are in a market that's more or less inflation-proof, and demand-proof, because people are living longer. Hips, knees, elbows, wrists are growing by 15 per cent a year in most countries. The market is very buoyant.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, he says manufacturers would benefit from government help. 'There used to be assistance for buying new capital equipment - high-productivity machines, and so on. That was abolished. All the rhetoric is not going to deliver in terms of manufacturing, unless there is tangible assistance at the grassroots.' Otherwise, he says, there will be little manufacturing left.</p> <p>Implants International is keen to exploit new markets in the developing world. It currently does all its design, development and manufacturing on-site; but it has just signed a deal which should eventually allow the manufacture of some of its products on licence in China, for distribution throughout the Pacific Rim. 'We are struggling to compete in China with products that are manufactured here: we need to be there,' Emmanuel says.</p> <h2>Burden not boon: importer suffers</h2> <p>For Ian Malcolm, managing director of German-owned gasket maker Elring Klinger, based near Redcar in the north east of England, the cheaper pound is not a boon, but a burden. Almost all his raw materials - mainly steel - are imported from Europe, and priced in euros.</p> <p>'We're suffering quite severely with the exchange rate: it will probably cost us \u00a31m over the next 12 months, and when you're talking about a \u00a312m turnover business, that's quite serious.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, Malcolm believes that a weaker currency will eventually be good for UK plc as a whole. 'On a macro scale, we will start to be more competitive again. A lot of our customers are demanding low-cost production as part of the service we offer, and we're almost becoming that low-cost manufacturer.'</p> <p>Like many other UK manufacturers which have adapted to survive in the increasingly tough global economy in recent years, Elring Klinger has had to reduce the size of its workforce, from 280 in 2002 to 130 today. 'If you go back to the times of Red Robbo, [the militant trade union leader] at Longbridge, it was very much jobs for the boys and jobs for life. But it wasn't the real world.'</p> <p>However, despite competition from cheaper locations, such as India, Malcolm says he has hung on to customers who prefer to source components from nearby: 'If you're buying from India, you've either got to air freight at great expense, or it's six weeks at sea at the very least. If our customer has a quality concern, we can get somebody into their plant in four or five hours.'</p> <p>Asked whether he looks to the government's new manufacturing strategy for help, he says: 'We won't hold our breath.' His main gripe with the policies of the past decade is the national minimum wage. When first introduced, he was paying above it, but since then he says it has begun to bite, raising his labour costs. 'How can you expect employers to match a 70 per cent increase in wage costs over the last seven years? It's unrealistic. It's making the UK less profitable.'</p> <h2>Uphill struggle: Strong euro pushes up the price of materials for maker of folded bikes</h2> <p>Will Butler-Adams, managing director of London-based Brompton Bicycle, believes there are reasons to be optimistic about manufacturing. 'If you're a British manufacturer who is involved in something which involves intellectual property, which involves a distinctive, unique selling point, which uses really clever engineering, then there's no reason why you shouldn't be really successful.'</p> <p>However, he has been forced to take drastic action this year as the price of the raw materials for the folding bikes Brompton makes has jumped. 'For the first time in our history, we've had to add a 7.5 per cent surcharge for our European customers,' he says.</p> <p>'We're buying quite a lot of our raw materials priced in euros, so we get hit by the fact that these parts are becoming more expensive. We then put a 5 per cent price increase across all of our markets.'</p> <p>Brompton has absorbed most of the rise in the cost of commodities, by accepting shrinking margins; but Butler-Adams says the financial pressures were so severe that he could not avoid asking for a 'contribution' from distributors. 'It's knocked our bottom line by about \u00a3200,000. Knowing that we're taking the brunt, they don't mind.'</p> <p>He believes the decline in sterling will be of little help. 'I don't think the pound is going to make much difference. The thing that matters is finding really good engineers, or really good designers.'</p> <p>Although the slowdown is beginning to bite in Europe, strong sales in emerging markets - including South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore - are helping to boost Brompton's performance. 'In terms of our actual market, we have seen Europe slow; but in Asia, our market has remained very, very strong. The fact that the product is manufactured in Britain - in London, even - has a real value in Asia: they really enjoy that.'</p> <p>He expects to maintain a healthy pace of expansion for the forseeable future. 'We're in a unique niche market, which is growing rapidly. We expect to grow by 25 per cent for the next few years.'</p>",
  "<p>Women are a rum do. Born everywhere without high heels - and then seeking to cripple themselves at the first opportunity by adopting them as some ludicrously alleged weapon of liberation and empowerment - 'killer' heels, my arse! Look at Posh Spice's ever-mis face - a bunion-wracked testimony to a life lived on the balls of one's trotters. The only thing high heels appear to have killed in her case is her ability to have a laugh.</p> <p>And then there is the way that, having come a good way towards freeing themselves (thanks to a combination of feminism and science) from the tyranny that heterosexual men once held over their lives, they promptly hand the reins over to gay men, the clowns!</p> <p>As I get older I think, contrary to modern assumption but in line with the old Lerner and Lowe song, that it would actually benefit both them and society if - to quote Professor Higgins - a woman could be more like a man. The different attitudes which men and women hold towards gay members of the opposite sex is a case in point. What straight men want from lesbians is very simple; they want to watch them have sex. They're quite happy to pay, even! (Don't get me wrong, I love being a hack. But when I hear about women getting paid to have sex with other women, I do wonder if I'm in the wrong business...)</p> <p>Many straight women, on the other hand, want far too much from gay men. They want them to be best friend, wardrobe mistress, facilitator, father figure... they want them to make everything all right, wiping the slate clean of all the disappointments that men who were actually vile enough to see them as sexual beings - the dirty swine! - inflicted on them.</p> <p>The latest beneficiary of this colossal collective female soppiness is Gok Wan, who like many other men, straight and gay alike, seems to have one of those magic mirrors - you know, those lunatic looking-glasses that reflect back to the ugliest of men a veritable love god who is in some way qualified to comment on the physical deficiencies of women. Mr Wan has successfully seen off the two-headed atrocity that was Trinny and Susannah with his Channel 4 show, How To Look Good Naked; wow, dig the logic there! A man who is, by definition, at best unmoved and at worst repelled by the naked female form being paid to show you sad bitches how not to make men run screaming for the sanctuary of the gay bar.</p> <p>And now we are to be treated to a new spectacle starring this strange creature; Channel 4's forthcoming Gok's Beauty Show. 'Calling all fabulous females!' went the cattle call. 'Gok Wan wants you! Are you proud of who you are and what you look like? Could you be Britain's most beautiful babe? The King of Style is launching a nationwide search. Curvaceous, slender, natural or glam, tiny to towering, unconventional beauty or model material... he wants you all for his brand new series. It's all about beauty that's more than skin deep... it's the show that every gorgeous gal should be part of...'</p> <p>Isn't life grand? No sooner do women take on board the message that there really is more to life than pleasing straight men, than they're invited to caper at the court of King Gok. No wonder that a certain type of rag-fag, seeing this weakness and willingness to please transferred from straight men to themselves, has reacted with contempt, barely disguising, and sometimes even flaunting, their misogyny. It is interesting that the women who most immerse themselves in fashion - and in taking orders from gay men - lead emotional lives of bleak desolation, as though such contortion renders heterosexual men complete strangers to them. </p> <p>It is also interesting to note that the original supermodels are now making a comeback after being dismissed in the Nineties as being 'greedy' by a gaggle of male designers who lived like Sun Kings. Linda, Claudia, Naomi, Christy, Stephanie and of course Our Kate are bagging the big campaigns and the editorial pages alike. Most notably, 43-year-old Linda Evangelista has bagged the Prada contract from 23-year-old Sasha Pivarova, who fronted the past six. The seeing off of the compliant, cheap Easterners by the bolshy homegrown workers that the credit crunch has led to in the most humdrum of jobs has found a grotesque, gilded echo in the rarefied super-strata of luxe living. With their histories of divorce, childbirth, miscarriage and drug scandals, the supers are seen as 'survivors', despite their charmed lives.</p> <p>'I suppose it's just our way of expressing ourselves,' says Keira Knightley's sad Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, in the new film The Duchess. 'You [men] have so many ways of expressing yourself, whereas we must make do with our hats and dresses.' And this lament echoes down the ages. No matter how old and glorious the models, sad indeed is the woman who sees fashion as a means of self-expression rather than an agent of social control.</p>",
  "<p>There are many who do not like Rachida Dati. The left detests her as an acolyte of Nicolas Sarkozy, France's maverick right-wing President. The employees of France's Ministry of Justice make little secret of their profound distaste for their boss's methods, views and taste for foreign travel and photoshoots in luxury hotels. A number of high-level civil servants have resigned from Dati's private office muttering about vicious personal verbal abuse, tantrums and incompetence. The fact that Dati is a Muslim of immigrant origin is enough for the extreme right; that she grew up on a tough housing estate on the outskirts of the central French city of Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne suffices for the haut bourgeois elite who still dominate vast tracts of France's economic, political and social life. </p> <p>Yet last week, Dati found herself universally popular. As so often in France, it was not the act itself that was important so much as the manner in which it was executed. Other women have become pregnant while in office - at least one while unmarried - but the paternity of the child has been at the very least identifiable. This time, not only is the father unknown, but 42-year-old Dati, who has never married and says that the birth of the infant will be the 'best day of her life', has hinted heavily that he could be one of a number of people. She is not going to say which one, however, restricting herself so far to the bald statement: 'My private life is complicated.'</p> <p>And this is the key. Because Dati has given the French what they enjoy most: an opportunity to mark the difference between them and the prudish, prurient, sexually neurotic, puritanical Anglo-Saxons, many of whom live nearby.</p> <p>So in editorial meetings across the nation, the decision has been taken to respect the French journalistic adage that 'news stops at the bedroom door'. Though rumours have been rife since Dati returned from her holiday at a luxury hotel in Morocco - ministers at the first cabinet meeting of the new political year apparently politely congratulated their colleague without actually making a direct reference to the increasingly evident bulge beneath her perfectly tailored Dior suit - no mainstream publication ran with the story until it was officially confirmed by the minister herself at a briefing of half-a-dozen female senior correspondents at the Ministry of Justice in the Place Vend\u00f4me early last week. </p> <p>There, a reportedly 'happy and calm' Dati, after a discussion about her reform plans for the French justice system, 'could not stop herself telling a small group of select correspondents the happy news'. To say the story was front page news would be an exaggeration, but it received widespread coverage in the French press, though without a single mention that the father of the child remained anonymous. Only the Anglo-Saxon press did that.</p> <p>Yet the distance with the sensationalist Britons and the family-value-obsessed Americans may be narrower than some in France like to think. The mainstream press may have behaved rather differently from their cross-Channel or transatlantic colleagues might have done, but the mass readership gossip magazines and the blogosphere have shown more interest in exactly who may be the father of the child of the 'newly happy diva de la Place Vend\u00f4me'.</p> <p>Dati has certainly known tough times. Her father was a devout and conservative Algerian-born mason, one of the hundreds of thousands of immigrant workers brought over to help with postwar reconstruction who stayed on. Her mother was an illiterate Moroccan farm girl. She grew up at Number 13, Rue Henri Dunant in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne on a grey, low-rise council estate in the shadow of a huge agricultural silo and processing plant. Dati's extraordinary drive to escape from the grey blocks, the vandalised playgrounds and the discount stores was obvious early on. Money earned as a check-out girl, in door-to-door make-up sales or as a home help for the elderly was reinvested in her economics degree.</p> <p>Just months after her graduation, she hustled her way to a meeting with the then Minister of Justice and into a job as an accountant. Seven years later, on the advice of another highly placed mentor, Simone Weil, the former minister and Holocaust survivor, she switched to law, working during the day and studying at night for her qualifications. A swift rise up the judges' ranks, more chutzpah and the same driving, steely ambition brought her to the notice of Sarkozy. 'You may not like Rachida but you can't help admiring her,' said one former associate. In France, where people still talk of coming from a 'good family', Dati is the political equivalent of an extraterrestrial.</p> <p>And her success, along with her abrasive style, has made her enemies. That she is good looking and likes expensive clothes has not helped. In the past 15 months, the attacks have come from every direction. Her ministry is one of the most high profile and a series of controversial reforms that the President, whom she continues to address with the formal 'vous' despite their close collaboration, asked her to push through has stirred up a hornet's nest of angry judges, rivals and unions.</p> <p>The trial of a brother for heroin trafficking was an excuse for more attacks. The slightest gaffe is the pretext for editorials questioning her competence. Yet Dati is still there. The reforms have been largely pushed through. </p> <p>Dati angrily says that her life 'is not a novel' - yet there are a dozen biographies already in print and rumours of films. 'The more people search to romanticise my life, the more they look to deny me legitimacy. I've worked hard, that's all,' she told one interviewer last year. 'And even people who don't like me can't take that away from me.'</p> <p>Even admirers find her hard work. Henri Guiano, the President's closest counsellor, has said she thinks everyone is looking down on her. 'It is like she has been skinned alive,' he told a reporter. When a fellow minister offered his support during the trial of her brother, calling her 'my little Rachida', she exploded. 'You would not say that to Christine Lagardere [the Finance Minister] or Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie [Minister of the Interior],' she told him. 'I don't need you or your support.' </p> <p>When another major conservative politician and rival tried to build bridges by inviting her to lunch after denigrating her publicly, she was unavailable on the date suggested 'and for ever'. To the most wounding verbal assaults, she simply says grimly: 'I have heard worse.'</p> <p>But her loyalty to Sarkozy is unshakable and has so far been rewarded not merely by the protection of the head of state but by invitations to travel with him - even on the family holiday last year that saw the Sarkozys controversially visit the American first couple on their ranch. Dati has said of rivals in the French cabinet that they serve their careers, she serves one man. </p> <p>When it came to choosing between her close friend Cecilia, the second wife of the President whom he divorced shortly after entering the Elys\u00e9e, and Sarkozy (and her political career), there was no hesitation. On her desk currently at the ministry are four pictures of her with Sarkozy and one of her with Carla Bruni, his new wife. </p> <p>Dati has said that she will stay in her post as long as possible - 'Pregnancy is not an illness,' she barked at one reporter - but is already hinting that the next step might be an assault on the Paris town hall. For the moment, whatever the mainstream newspapers say or do, the question that everyone wants answered is simple: 'Who's the daddy?'</p> <p>The frankly improbable outsiders include Sarkozy himself - there was a period of some months when Cecilia had left and before Carla had arrived during which Dati travelled frequently with the President - and Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar, the former Spanish Prime Minister and friend of Sarkozy. The latter even took the extraordinary step of denying - suspiciously rapidly, some say - that he was Dati's lover after being named by a Moroccan news website last week. </p> <p>Closer to home, Dati has been linked to two French businessmen in recent weeks. Both are described locally as 'richissime', which needs no translation. Gossip magazines have taken to frantically calculating with whom Dati was rumoured to have been on holiday at potential moments of conception. Another name in circulation is a popular television host and producer known simply as Arthur.</p> <p>Between the French viewpoint and that of the 'Anglo-Saxons' there is a middle way. The French minister, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said, was an example for single mothers everywhere. 'Her silence [on the identity of the father] contains a profoundly political message,' the newspaper told its readers. 'The woman who faces motherhood alone is no longer a sad and shameful loser but a proud woman with nothing to hide from anyone.'</p> <p>As Dati might say, there are worse things that can be said of someone.</p> <h2>The Dati lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>27 November 1965, the second of 12 children of a Moroccan mason father and an Algerian mother. Worked as a medical assistant in a private care home at 16 after leaving school, continuing her studies in the evenings and gaining degrees in both economics and law.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> Having written to the then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy in 2002 stating her desire to advise him on immigration, she became a constant and loyal figure, taking the role of spokesperson during his fight for the presidency. Her loyalty was rewarded in June 2007 when her appointment as Justice Minister made her the first person of North African descent to hold a top government post in France.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> Her mother, whom Rachida described as 'the light of my life', died at an early age, forcing her to look after her younger siblings. She has since said: 'When I lost her, I thought I had been punished.'</p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> Rejecting the notion that she is a role model: 'My life is not a beautiful story. I am not the heroine of an instructive novel to present to the people so they can shed a tear or to encourage them to work hard.'</p> <p><strong>What others say</strong> 'You'd love to have occupied it, wouldn't you?' <strong>Carla Bruni</strong> to Dati, pointing to Nicolas Sarkozy's double bed in the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Sarkozy has referred to Dati as 'ma beurette', meaning 'my little Arab girl'.</p>",
  "<p>After a week that was supposed to 'relaunch' Labour on a path to better political health, Gordon Brown heads into his second conference season as leader with more bad blood being shed around him than at any time since he became Prime Minister. On first impressions, and after little more than a year in the job, the game might already appear to be up. His party is at war with itself - as proved today by union leader Derek Simpson's extraordinary outburst against Foreign Secretary David Miliband - and seems completely unable to focus on the external enemy, David Cameron's Tories.</p> <p>The Conservatives, in their own state of desperation exactly a year ago as Brown wallowed in his long-forgotten political honeymoon, cannot believe their good fortune. 'We do not need to do anything at all. Just sit and enjoy the show,' said one Tory frontbencher.</p> <p>There will be another outbreak of internal Labour strife this week as the TUC inflicts a series of bruising defeats on a badly weakened Prime Minister, demanding a windfall tax on energy companies, a new progressive income tax system to punish the rich, an easing of pay discipline at a time when inflation is going through the roof, and a huge increase in spending on council homes.</p> <p>Dave Prentis, general secretary of Britain's largest union, Unison, and a voice of relative moderation in the union movement, set the scene for what promises to be an ugly congress, leading to an equally ugly gathering of the entire Labour party in two weeks' time. 'In everything that has happened our government has lost its way,' he said. Labour voters and trade unionists, he argued, were 'fed up to the back teeth', with a leadership that never seemed to act in their interests, while pandering to big business.</p> <p>Today TUC leader Brendan Barber weighs in by publishing a report trashing Brown's period as Chancellor and Prime Minister, which it says has failed to deliver on the objective of most Labour supporters - narrowing the income gap between rich and poor. Instead it accuses the government under Brown's stewardship of creating a 'golden age for the rich', adding: 'The hands-off policies of recent times are becoming increasingly difficult to justify ... There are clear signs that we have reached the limit of public tolerance of a society skewed so heavily in favour of the rich, irrespective of the impact on others.'</p> <p>It is not just the direction of policy that divides the party and angers MPs. The very operation of government seems to be dysfunctional under Brown. Behind the scenes, a virtual breakdown of relations between the Treasury and Number 10 (and the Prime Minister and his Chancellor, following Alistair Darling's doom-laden economic analysis) has prevented any coherent response aimed at helping the less well-off deal with the pending global recession. </p> <p>Everywhere, Labour's personal rivalries and policy differences thwart decisive action. Last week the Treasury, which had cautioned against the introduction of a stamp duty holiday to help first-time buyers, found itself overruled by Number 10 and on Tuesday one was announced - to widespread lack of enthusiasm. </p> <p>By Thursday, Brown's modest economic relaunch was in further disarray when his advisers admitted that negotiations with energy companies to extract \u00a3100 a head to help people on low incomes with fuel bills had broken down. 'This relaunch has already failed and it has not really started yet,' said one former cabinet minister gloomily.</p> <p>Calls to government departments in recent days to ask about measures to help homeowners with fuel bills - due next week - have revealed virtual paralysis in Whitehall. Number 10, meanwhile, is failing to give a lead as it conducts its own feuds. Stephen Carter, the PR man drafted in by Brown to sharpen his image and presentation, is involved in a vicious turf war with suggestions that he is about to be ousted and may be offered a peerage. Officials who are supposed to give information to the press instead seek information themselves from journalists: 'What have you heard? We don't know what is going on. We can't say if it is definitely coming next week.' </p> <p>Against this background, it was predictable that Charles Clarke, the combustible former Home Secretary, should try to fuel the flames by calling publicly, for the first time, for Brown to go 'with honour'. Clarke coupled this suggestion with an admission that no one in the cabinet was ready yet to strike against the Prime Minister. Less predictable was the response across the party. Clarke's remarks focused minds not just on the scale of the crisis - but the absence of an answer in the form of an alternative candidate for the leadership. One senior Labour MP remarked: 'What Charles did was to show that we have a crisis - but he also showed we have no one else who can solve it for us.'</p> <p>Many in the union movement and on Labour's centre-left were talking a few weeks ago of launching moves to oust Brown from office if they could persuade a credible figure such as Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary, to stand. Now they have swung back behind Brown - at least for the time being. Johnson has refused, thus far, to show what one union source described as 'even the smallest bit of leadership leg'. And on the right, David Miliband's mid-summer display of his own ambition has failed to generate the backing he would have hoped for.</p> <p>For Labour MPs, the benefits of plunging into a messy and divisive leadership contest at a time when the public expects government to be governing are not clear. Yesterday Andy Hornby, head of the UK's largest mortgage provider, HBOS, predicted that it would be 18 months before house prices would start to rise again. One backbencher said: 'Just now, in this economic climate, [a leadership contest] would seem and look irresponsible. There is a real risk that it would do us more harm than good.' </p> <p>Prentis, speaking on behalf of Unison's 800,000 public sector members, summed up the current feeling across much of the party by insisting that despite everything Brown should be given more time, not because he deserves it, but because there is no alternative. Changing leader now, Prentis said, would make 'no difference whatsoever'. 'Who has got more experience than the current Prime Minister? Who could we put in who is going to come in with the panacea to cure all these problems? They are not around. The problems are too serious.'</p> <p>If the events of recent weeks are anything to go by, however, there is scant evidence that Brown and his government will use the stay of execution to good effect. This week, Labour is due to announce a deal with the energy companies under which home owners on lower incomes will receive help with insulation.</p> <p>But it is only expected to be worth between \u00a3300m and \u00a31bn. The Local Government Association calculates that up to \u00a35bn needs to be provided over the next few years for the scheme to work. Such small-scale assistance is likely only to further anger Labour backbenchers, around 130 of whom are now backing the unions' demands for a windfall tax on the energy companies. The windfall tax issue is dividing government from top to bottom. While the Treasury and Number 10 insist that the measure is still a runner, other ministers admit that this seems to be a holding line to get the party through the conference season. John Hutton, the Blairite Business Secretary and bane of the left, would, friends believe, be prepared to resign if the plan, which he believes would drive companies and investment in new, more efficient technology abroad, were approved. There are also continuing tensions about how to assist the mortgage market, with Number 10 backing action on a \u00a3100bn extension of mortgage-backed securities while the Treasury and Bank of England remain opposed.</p> <p>Labour MPs in marginal seats and union leaders trying to justify their financial links with the party to their members want some drastic, decisive action, not piecemeal, disappointingly limited measures. Increasingly, they cite the boldness of moves being made in the US to help home buyers there as evidence of how to tackle a crisis with firm responses.</p> <p>US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was last night poised to announce an emergency taxpayer-backed rescue plan for giant mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as Washington battles to prevent the year-long credit crunch claiming fresh victims on Wall Street. </p> <p>News of the mooted rescue emerged as another regional American bank, the eleventh so far this year, collapsed in the face of losses from the housing crisis. The Silver State Bank, in Nevada, which until recently counted Andrew McCain, son of the Republican presidential candidate John McCain, on its board, was shut down by federal regulators on Friday.</p> <p>By the time MPs return to Westminster next month, the clock will be ticking again. By then higher winter fuel bills will be arriving and MPs postbags will be filling up with complaints from angry constituents. In October or early November, Labour could face another humiliating Scottish byelection reverse - this time in Glenrothes - at the hands of the resurgent Scottish Nationalists. Defeat in Brown's own political backyard would unleash another bout of speculation over the Prime Minister's future.</p> <p>Prentis and other senior party members have decided to give the Prime Minister time - but they will not wait for ever. 'We will review things at the end of the year,' he observed. 'It is a very interesting situation.'</p>",
  "<p>Scotland is calling on Westminster for help in implementing controversial plans to ban off-sale drinks to under-21s in an attempt to curb alcohol abuse across the country.</p> <p>Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has admitted that, without support from the UK government, radical moves to rein in irresponsible drinking in Scotland will be difficult to impose. But he has vowed that the Scottish parliament would not be dissuaded from pressing ahead with the proposals, which have been condemned as 'ludicrous' and 'ridiculous' by opposition MSPs and representatives from the drinks trade. </p> <p>In particular, he said help was essential in preventing the setting up of huge distribution hangars near the Scottish border, as well as stopping internet sales or lorries from England bearing three-for-two deals that could be outlawed.</p> <p>Writing in today's Observer, he pleads: 'I believe that cross-border co-operation is important. Alcohol misuse doesn't stop at the border. I don't believe there's not a problem in Carlisle or Newcastle, the same as there is in Dumfries or Edinburgh'. MacAskill has written to Westminster to state his views. </p> <p>Consultations on the proposals end this week. Plans include banning shops from selling drinks to under-21s, setting a minimum price for alcoholic drinks and introducing a 'social responsibility fee' that would require the drinks and retail trade to pay reparation if they were found to have been selling alcohol irresponsibly. The Tories have pledged to fight the plans, which are part of Alex Salmond's 'big bang' legislation package and an attempt to tackle alcohol abuse, which legislators estimate costs Scotland \u00a32.25bn each year.</p> <p>Although stopping short of calling on England and Wales to follow suit, there is clearly the hope that the rest of the UK will consider the same tough action, as they did with the smoking ban, which was successfully implemented in Scotland before being introduced elsewhere in Britain. </p> <p>But critics have claimed that it would be ludicrous to criminalise a responsible 20-year-old father - who can vote, marry and be sent to war - and who might want to buy a bottle of wine to take home to celebrate the birth of his child. </p> <p>They have said that responsible drinkers would be stigmatised by being forced to line up in a special 'drinks only' queue in supermarkets.</p> <p>The Wine and Spirit Trade Association accused the Scottish National party of 'chasing headlines' and said it would not solve social behaviour problems connected with drinking.</p> <p>Those opposed say that retailers would simply put resources into internet sales, allowing customers to flout the law and order online for home delivery from stores outside Scotland. Bootlegging would also be impossible to eradicate, they say, with van drivers stocking up in England and plying their trade through the back door in Glasgow. </p> <p>But MacAskill stressed: 'Some people may think we can be convinced not to go ahead. That is simply not the case. I want to work with our colleagues in the UK government to build on what we're doing in Scotland and make sure people can't exploit the situation and undermine our drive for tough action.'</p> <p>The proposals come at a turbulent time in Scottish politics, with Labour in turmoil, without a leader, and facing a second catastrophic by-election defeat, this time in Glenrothes.</p>",
  "<p>Walking through the hammering and banging that are the preparations of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum's imminent 'Cold War Modern' exhibition, I found myself recalling a childhood memory of the Tornados' 1962 novelty hit 'Telstar'. Perhaps the first record named after a communications satellite, it had a radiophonic character, like lyrical static from an old analogue phone line. It caught the mood of the period, somewhere between optimism and fear. And rather technophiliac.</p> <p>Now that global plagues, terrorism and meteorological calamity have replaced the Red Army as threats, the Cold War period suddenly seems almost benign. Much rather a T-54 tank on our lawn than al-Qaeda on the flightdeck. Germans call it 'Ostalgie', an irrational love of the workers' cacotopia that was Honecker's East Germany. East Berlin stank of Russian petrol and had cardboard Czech shoes in flyblown shop windows. People ate coal. As if to confirm the irrationality of consumers, just as soon as the East Germans achieved the liberation they craved, some started to yearn for the symbols of repression.</p> <p>The Lives of Others, Florian von Donnersmarck's meticulously propped East Berlin romance, was released in April 2007. Two months later, the Ostel opened in the city's fashionable Mitte district. The Ostel is styled 'Der DDR Design Hotel', and its rooms are full of refurbished Communist-era junk, acceptable now to fully ironised stylehounds. </p> <p>It's often called a Stasi hotel, but accommodation with the Staatsicherheits Polizei did not offer fast check-out facilities. The hotel has a dormitory called Pioneer Camp. The Ostshop is an in-house Konsum store selling bad plastic toys. Trabants are available for guests to drive. Magazines in the lobby carry Louis Vuitton ads showing Gorbachev slumped in a limo by the Berlin Wall. The Cold War has become collectible.</p> <p>It's thought that Don Juan Manuel was the first person to use the expression Cold War. His 'guerra fria' referred to the antagonism between Islam and Christian Europe. And that was in the 13th century. In 1938 Nation magazine referred to Hitler's Cold War. Orwell used the expression in 1945. It was popularised by Walter Lippmann's 1947 articles. In an age of sinister metaphors, the Cold War was what blew across the Iron Curtain. It began on VJ-Day, 15 August 1945, and lasted until 1962, when U-2 spyplanes found nuclear missiles on Cuba. Or did it end with Prague, 1968? Or Vietnam, 1975? Possibly Berlin, 1989. President George Bush Sr said in 1992 that the greatest American achievement was to end it. He spoke too soon.</p> <p>The American response to the stand-off was to create a fabulous world in which life could be improved by ever-increased consumption of goods. Tom Wolfe called it the American Century. American family cars sucked fuel like an Atlas launcher on lift-off. Modern furniture found a vast market in the millions of homes built in the Fifties. Magazines ran features on 'air-supported domes for all-year swimming'. </p> <p>Architecture and design became known as mid-century modern. Morris Lapidus's Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach (1954), with its boomerang shapes, was at least as typical as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building (1958), with its straight lines. There was an 800-cover dining room with a hydraulic dance floor. Guests were so swamped with luxuriosa that Lapidus said the effect was like being carried on a silver platter. Elvis liked the interior man-made mountain and waterfall. Miss Universe was staged there. </p> <p>For every Bauhaus chair in a corporate lobby there were a hell of a lot more Barcaloungers. If furniture could be obese, a Barcalounger - with built-in massagers and heaters - was obese. At home, Lippmann's Cold War became America's 'full-blooded, go-to-hell, belly-rubbing wahoo-yahoo youthful rampage', as Wolfe had it. Asked to explain his aesthetic, Harley Earl of General Motors, the man who gave the world cars inspired by intercontinental ballistic missles, said: 'I want that line to have a duflunky, to come across, have a little hook in it, and then do a rashoom or a zong.'</p> <p>And then there was Europe. The West Germans coped with increasing prosperity by applying Bauhaus design principles to consumer goods: Dieter Rams's austerity for Braun electrical products would only have been acceptable in a culture where alternatives were becoming available. Meanwhile, the Ossis (East Germans) had trouble making enamel buckets. Soviet-sector product design was charmingly bad. The Soyuzelektropribor television receiver had wobbly legs and loose knobs. That's if you could receive television.</p> <p>Yet Soviet-controlled Europe was curiously ambitious about consumerism. In 1959, at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, Vice-President Nixon sought to humiliate Khrushchev with an American dream kitchen. The pictures are priceless: fridge as symbol of ideological victory. For Eisenhower's visit to Moscow, Khrushchev commissioned the Soviet Union's sole celebrity designer, Yuri Soloviev, to make an 8,000 horsepower speedboat. 'She's bourgeois... but I like her,' the Russian said. Those Zil limos favoured by the apparatchiks were in fact cargo-cult US Packards. Late in the Cold War, Concordski aped the Anglo-French prototype.</p> <p>What are the other themes at the V&amp;A? Mawkish socialist realism versus studio modernism. The green glass Lever Building of Park Avenue up against brutish Stalinist classicism. Everywhere, it seems, molecules and atoms inspired designers. There were the Atomiums and telecom towers: Moscow's Ostankino of 1967, Berlin's from 1969. There's the ever-present rhetoric of military futurism. Ken Adam's sets for The Ipcress File and early Bond do paranoia nicely. </p> <p>But this infatuation with military sources may also have begun in America: Charles Eames learnt about moulding plywood from army medical corps splints, and the Harvard-trained architect Eliot Noyes's adroit styling of IBM's image would not have been possible without US military technology. Back in the DDR, Bauhaus austerity suited autocracy well, but it also did well in Manhattan.</p> <p>In the West, designers were meant to excite demand; in the East, they were meant to do no such thing. Walking around 'Cold War Modern', you realise how advertising and design were handmaidens in Europe and America. In the West, design and the culture of waste were inseparable. The single most affecting image is the Tower of Zinc Buckets from Wroclaw's 1948 'Exhibition of Regained Lands'. No Madison Avenue USP here. </p> <p>It's compellingly interesting material - within living memory, yet as dated as the Regency - but the stage army of academics who contribute to the catalogue (people who begin paragraphs with expressions such as 'I will argue') do not persuade me that it's a coherent subject. In parts, it's more like a Bulgarian car boot sale. For example: besides his IBM products, Noyes also designed the interior for the bizjet of Raleigh Warner, the Mobil boss for whom he also created a global stereotype of filling stations. Propaganda at the pump! </p> <p>But Noyes flying his plane through the Connecticut skies, drinking his cocktails in Country Club Road, New Canaan (one of the US's wealthiest areas) and driving his Porsche or his T-bird or his Land Rover to play golf does not have much in common with a toiling member of the All Union Association of Technical Draftsmen in the Volkseigener Betrieb Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau at work on a Trabi.</p> <p>As always in design exhibitions organised by art historians, there's more concern with foot-noting and point-scoring than engaging with the material. What does it mean? Why should we care? Exactly why is East German Tupperware in the V&amp;A? Why be afraid to say? Why structure it as a book? On the evidence here, the quality of the American and European achievement is far superior. And I don't just mean in modular kitchen storage. It's an ambition of the organisers to establish Cold War Modern as a new style-label, bravely to adjust our perceptions of schisms that might or might not have happened in architecture and design after 1945. They don't want to fetishise designers as personalities, but fetishise a historical moment instead.</p> <p>The different cultures do, however, have one thing in common: in The End of Ideology, published in 1960 and conceived at the chilly depths of the Cold War, Daniel Bell said: 'Capitalism... is a system wherein man exploits man... and Communism is vice versa.' Capitalism simply seems to do it better.</p> <p>Oh, and by the way. The greatest legacy of the Cold War? Not, I think a Trabi, drenched in ironic cuteness. Rather, it's the internet, a system designed to secure free movement of the US command structure's data in the event of a Soviet missile attack. They thought it was really going to happen. It still might.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cold War Modern: Design 1945-70 runs from 25 Sep-11 Jan 2009 at the V&amp;A, London SW1</p>",
  "<p>It's 11 years since the Hacienda nightclub lost its licence but the spirit of 'Madchester' won't die, especially not while TV and film keep the madness, music and legends alive. Next week BBC3 comedy Massive will give us Danny (Ralf Little) and Shay (Carl Rice), as they seek to honour their hometown musical heroes with newly formed label Shady Records.

  "<p>As the cost of petrol blows an ever-bigger hole in our bank accounts, more of us are hopping on to bicycles instead.</p> <p>Sales at Halfords, one of Britain's biggest bicycle vendors, improved 7.2 per cent last year; cycling is on the rise in most cities and increased in London alone by 91 per cent in the past 12 months; and the government is wedded to encouraging pedal power nationwide as a way of getting fit, beating the traffic and bringing down carbon emissions.</p> <p>In fact, there's so much going for cycling that people are increasingly inclined to ignore the dangers and how much an accident could cost them. According to accident prevention charity RoSPA, about 16,000 cyclists were injured in 2006, the latest year for which figures are available, but between 60 and 90 per cent of incidents go unreported.</p> <p>Penny Knight, who heads the cycling and sports injuries' team at solicitors Leigh Day Co, lists the most common scenarios as vehicles turning right into the path of a cyclist or emerging from a side road, and collisions on roundabouts. 'In London, lorries turning left are the greatest cause of fatalities and serious injuries for cyclists,' he says.</p> <p>Unlike drivers, cyclists don't have to have insurance and compensation tends not to be uppermost in their minds.</p> <p>Colette Smith, of south London, is a typical example; she came off her bike in February on her way to work. Fortunately, a colleague was passing and made sure an ambulance took her to A&amp;E to treat her for cuts, grazes and concussion. Although Colette has no memory of what happened, she thinks her bike slipped on debris from a building site.</p> <p>It was only when her dentist presented her with a bill for \u00a32,350 for repairing the bridge she had damaged in the accident that she started wondering if she had a case for compensation. 'It is really annoying that I am having to pay with my hard-earned cash,' she says.</p> <p>The reality is that accidents that don't involve another party are sometimes tricky to prove, but it's worth discussing any possible claim with a personal injury lawyer. 'Cyclists tend not to want to make a quick buck', says Kevin O'Sullivan of solicitors Levenes, a keen cyclist who has represented other cyclists for more than 10 years. 'But they should make a claim because costs start mounting up and the law is there to protect them.'</p> <p>Using a solicitor specialising in cycling accidents is a wise move. 'They're very used to seeing the kind of accident that cyclists have and the arguments that insurers try to make,' says O'Sullivan.</p> <p>Common objections from insurers are that a cyclist was not wearing high-visibility clothing at night or a helmet. However, neither is obligatory. The law looks less favourably on those who break the rules of the road, such as cycling the wrong way up one-way streets or jumping red lights, but it all comes down to proving negligence.</p> <p>'If cyclists can establish that a third party has been negligent they're entitled to compensation for their injuries and losses,' says Knight. 'So if you break your arm you will get compensation for that. But if you also take time off work, you will be paid for any loss of earnings.'</p> <p>The cases most likely to succeed are those where a cyclist has collided with a vehicle. Where a cyclist has hit a pothole, manhole cover or debris, the first port of call is the local authority, which might redirect the claimant to a building contractor or service provider. In the case of a hit-and-run accident or a diesel spillage, the claim will go to the Motor Insurers' Bureau, funded by motor insurers to compensate victims of negligent uninsured or untraced drivers.</p> <p>While the time limit for a personal injury claim is three years, the quicker an accident victim finds a solicitor to pull together all the evidence, the more likely he is to win. In an ideal world the victim will have called the police, taken photos (mobile-phone pictures will do) of the scene and any injuries and noted the contact details of any witnesses. Unfortunately, the cyclist is often in no fit state to do this. Even then, all is not necessarily lost. 'A competent lawyer can get information from police and hospitals,' says O'Sullivan. Ambulance records also provide useful evidence.</p> <p>Personal injury solicitors are often registered with the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, which provides an online search facility (<a href=\"http://www.apil.org.uk\">www.apil.org.uk</a>). Bodies such as the CTC, the national cyclists' organisation, and London Cycling Campaign offer legal advice as a perk of membership. Claims management companies are now regulated but still have a reputation for greed and hard-selling. They are best avoided, especially if there is no solicitor handling claims, as they will not be able to pursue compensation through the courts and could persuade you to settle for a lower out-of-court award against your best interests.</p> <p>Generally, where claimants have no legal expenses insurance, solicitors operate on a no-win, no-fee basis. This means that when you win, the other party's insurers pick up your legal bill, and if you lose, you don't have to pay your own legal fees, though you could be liable for your opponent's. A special insurance policy can cover the other side's costs.</p> <p>Avoiding an accident in the first place is, of course, the preferred outcome. 'The precautions to take are to get cycle training and maintain your bicycle,' advises Tom Bogdanowicz, campaigns and development manager at the London Cycling Campaign. 'Training helps you to be confident in traffic and adopt a road position where you can be seen, communicate clearly with other road users and be aware of traffic movements.' </p> <h2>3,000 out of court</h2> <p>Jules Richards, a research chemist from Hale, Cornwall, had only ridden his \u00a31,500 bike three times when he was involved in a collision in February. A keen triathlete, he had just begun a training ride when a car pulled out in front of him. He went straight into the side of it and bounced off the windscreen. 'I ended up in the middle of the road, sprawled out,' he says. He suffered extensive bruising to his left hip, knee and shoulder, but managed to take the motorist's insurance details.</p> <p>His local cycle shop pronounced his bike a write-off and, as Jules was a member of British Triathlon Federation, suggested he contact them. Their solicitors, Leigh Day, advised him to report the incident to police and obtain two quotes for his bike. 'I didn't think I'd be eligible for damages,' says Jules. However, he ended up with an out-of-court settlement of \u00a31,250 for his injuries and a further \u00a31,750 for his damaged bike, helmet and cycle jacket. British Triathlon paid his legal fees.</p> <p>Jules has just taken part in a five-day John o' Groats to Land's End bike ride to raise money for Penny Bond Cancer Care and Cancer Research UK.</p>",

  "<p>It's being described as a third agricultural revolution. A new generation of people living - as much as they can - off the land: swapping their inner-city gardens for hardscrabble smallholdings, the daily commute for early-morning goat milking, their domestic cats for pedigree pigs, their Blackberries for home-made compost. It's not easy, and it's not always pretty - don't imagine that this is about flowery Cath Kidston wellington boots. Most of the so-called 'greenshifters' are more bothered about potato blight and blow fly than owning the idyllic country cottage with clematis over the door. But there does seem to be something stirring in the cynical soul of the British urbanite. A shift in ambition, away from consumerism and city life, even as the credit crunch takes hold. So much so, according to the most recent State of the Countryside report, that for the first time in generations more people are moving to rural areas than are moving out of them - and crucially the newcomers are families with young children.</p> <p>The best indication that something is changing is the fact that rural land is holding its value, and this despite the slump in the property market elsewhere. Figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggest that in some areas the price of an acre has increased by 50 per cent. Many smallholders head towards Wales, Scotland and the east coast where it's still possible to find something affordable, but in places such as Devon, Britain's most expensive county, agents are charging as much as \u00a38,000 an acre. There is, perhaps, a bitter-sweet irony to the fact that strapped-for-cash farmers have realised they can make money by selling off relatively modest areas - a small-holding can be anything up to 40 acres - to people chasing the rural dream. According to rural estate agents, four out of five small farms these days are sold to newcomers. </p> <p>Robert Jeffery and David Morris used to be dairy farmers until they realised they had something more marketable than milk - their experience. They set up NewLandOwner (<a href=\"http://www.newlandowner.co.uk\">www.newlandowner.co.uk</a>), a Derbyshire-based company which runs courses on how to start a smallholding. Jeffery advises on everything from how to handle goats to how to get planning permission, to all kinds of people, from wannabe Alpaca farmers to millionaires who fancy having a go at growing their own vegetables. 'Most don't especially need to make a profit,' he says. 'They just want the business to wash its face. It's as easy to make a living on a 20-acre farm as it is on a 200-acre farm. But for the first two years it is all about investment and no income.'</p> <p>The courses have proved so popular, Jeffery now calls himself a 'twilight farmer' in that the only chance he has to work on his own farm is at the end of the day. 'I think people are motivated by the falseness of life in the city,' he says. 'They want to get back to basics.' </p> <p>While this is not the first time that young people have wanted to get back to the land, this current generation has advantages over their forbears from the Sixties and Seventies many of whom embarked on a new kind of life only to find it impossible to survive. First - no one thinks you're mad to try it any longer. The popularity of allotments and chicken-keeping (said to be the nation's fastest-growing hobby) means something that was once seen as hippy and alternative is swiftly becoming more mainstream. At the same time it's become much more accessible: there are countless smallholder books and websites; even the right equipment is more easily purchased than it used to be.</p> <p> Pat Gardiner, used to work in the port industry until he decided to fend for himself back in the Seventies. He started a self-sufficiency website (<a href=\"http://www.goselfsufficient.co.uk\">www.goselfsufficient.co.uk</a>) in his spare time. He thinks people feel out of control of their lives now, in the same way as he did in the Seventies. 'Recession, price inflation, uncertainty. The instinct to batten down the hatches and look after yourself, leave the world outside, is deeply ingrained,' he says. 'You may think it's a dream but you can actually do it.'</p> <h2>The new recruits</h2> <p><strong>Two ex-RAF trade Iraq for goats and an ice-cream parlour in Wales</strong></p> <p>Tony Knight calls them 'my ladies' and can identify every one of his goats. Each has their own personality, he tells me. There's Wolfie, the herd matriarch. Apricot who can best be described as a bolshy teenager. There are the skittish escape artists, who if there's a hole in the fencing will find it; the body surfers who have a habit of launching themselves, Pete-Doherty style, over the rest of the herd. Most memorably there's the one who might have died if Jo, Tony's wife, hadn't nursed her back to health. In their bedroom. </p> <p>When Tony came home he told her off (that's Jo, not the goat). </p> <p>The experts advise first-time smallholders to start with something easy, like chickens. Fifty- five British Toggenburg goats in a barn in the garden is a bit like having 55 teething babies in the spare room. They may be cute - a lovely mushroom grey colour, with white Gandalf beardy bits - but they also have a unique talent for disrupting a night's sleep or refusing to feed. With their high-pitched bleat, they even sound like squalling infants.</p> <p>Still, owning a herd of goats beats flying Hercules airplanes in Afghanistan and Iraq, says Tony with a grin. His old job was in the RAF. 'I've been mortared a few times, been shot at a few times as well. Somewhere out there you know there is a bullet with your name on it and every time a gun goes off, it gets one closer to you.' Different shift patterns meant that Jo, who also worked for the RAF, on the logistics side, never saw her husband. 'And it was only a matter of time before she'd be called up, too. As the Forces shrink in size, you're more likely to go. At least I was flying - on the ground it would have been even more dangerous.'</p> <p>So in 2004, after 16 years in the RAF, the couple decided to try their hand at something else. There was a long, frustrating search for the right place until they found Little Ffarm Dairy - 38 acres nestled in an idyllic spot in the countryside of Carmarthenshire. ('Turn left at the beech tree,' run the directions for my mini-cab driver.) They have a vegetable patch, an orchard, plus plenty of room for chickens, geese and ducks, some sheep and ponies. The notion of keeping goats came to Jo when they visited a small goat dairy in Aberystwyth. 'I've always fancied doing something like that,' she said to her husband. Tony replied: 'Well, why don't we? If we don't do it now, we never will.'</p> <p>This may sound impetuous, but they actually come across as an eminently sensible pair. The sale of their house in the Cotswolds, plus pensions from the RAF, helped to pay for the \u00a3350,000 farm (though they still have a mortgage). They've completed a couple of livestock courses and a career in the Forces means they know all about long hours and how to cope in a crisis. 'The training in the Air Force means we know what's needed to be done and we do it literally to perfection because that's the way we've been trained,' says Tony. </p> <p>This hasn't stopped the goats giving them the runaround on occasion. They put up video cameras in the barn, but the goats, like contestants on Big Brother, somehow learnt how to dodge them. Now they've hitched up baby monitors which means they can jump into their wellies if there's a problem in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Then there was the breach birth on their wedding anniversary that saw Tony in the barn with the distressed goat, and Jo on a phone with a poor signal trying to speak to the woman who sold them the goats in the first place to get instructions on what to do. 'Put your hand in and flick the legs forward!' she told him.</p> <p>Not long afterwards, when Tony was away, Jo wondered if she'd made the biggest mistake of her life. 'I'd had 16 years of complete routine and suddenly I was on my own, having to cope. The kids refused to feed. It seemed as though they'd rather starve than take the milk. It was half-past midnight and I was trying to get milk down their throats. I remember thinking: Bloody hell, what have I done? Talk about hell in paradise.'</p> <p>But gradually their new life is coming together. Tony has almost completed a new milking parlour, the shell made from an old Kingsmill bread lorry. Any day soon they'll be going into production with three flavours of Lovespoon, their luxury goats' milk ice cream, which Jo makes to her own recipes and without any artificial flavouring having completed a gelato course in Bologna. They've finally been given official environmental health approval. (The paperwork in farming is worse than the RAF. 'Which is saying something,' says Jo.) </p> <p>Hopefully, if the ice cream takes off, they'll finally turn a profit. For the moment, Tony has decided to take a commercial airline job to get some money in, one month on, one month off. The irony is that the neighbouring farmers envy Tony for the fact he flies airplanes whereas all he'd rather do is stay within sight of the cottage and chat to his ladies. 'We're not goat-obsessed,' insists Jo. 'I am,' says Tony.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lovespoongelato.co.uk\">www.lovespoongelato.co.uk</a></p> <h2>The novice smallholders</h2> <p><strong>The close-knit family keeping their late grandfather's dream alive</strong></p> <p>Chris Blevin, 39, is trying to plumb in two outside toilet cubicles for 200 guests ahead of their hog roast at the weekend. His mother-in-law Liz is fresh from making the latest batch of jams and chutneys which they sell to local farmer's markets and shops. Chris's wife Hannah, 34, is marshalling two of their three sons, Peter, 8, and Joel, 6, who are dressed up as a policeman and a pirate, respectively, while giving me a guided tour of their animals. She points out their pigs, Middle Whites and Large Blacks, and her favourite Muscovy ducks, as well as the vegetable beds and the fledgling orchard planted with 30 different types of tree. This is Peter's Eden Farm, three generations, living in two adjoining houses in the countryside near Boston and working on 13 acres of land. </p> <p>If it sounds idyllic, it is - and it isn't. It depends on which day you catch them. When the sun's shining and the hay's safely in, when Liz is up to speed on the latest order for jam and their sausages sell out in 28 hours - it couldn't be better. When Chris wakes and can hear the rain thrumming on the window panes for the third day in a row and Hannah has accidentally rolled the trailer into a dyke, then they wonder if it will ever get easier.</p> <p>Hannah, who used to run a veterinary laboratory, is the optimist. 'If I come down the field at sunset I do think how lucky we are.' Chris, on the other hand, is more likely to worry about the jobs left undone and the fact their mortgage is bigger now than it was when he was in full-time employment (although he still works regular days as a gearbox specialist for racing cars). 'There are more reasons to be low, than to be high.'</p> <p>Peter's Eden Farm is named after Hannah's father who died 11 years ago after a long illness and before he'd had a chance to retire from his job as a school teacher. His wife Liz, a 62-year-old retired doctors' receptionist, had always been interested in self-sufficiency. 'Oh yes,' she says. 'I always wanted the simple life. I would have been quite happy to live without electricity, to rough it. I never liked having to pay for things you could get yourself.' </p> <p>Hannah dreamt of giving her children the kind of childhood she'd enjoyed, but it took a few years before she could persuade Chris. 'There was a point after my dad died when Chris was always working in America. I just couldn't cope with it really. I kept thinking what's the point?' Finally, one evening, Chris came home to their ex-council house, dumped his bags and said: 'I've had enough. Let's do it.'</p> <p>'I didn't believe him at first,' says Hannah. 'I think he is a fantastic bloke for doing it. For taking the gamble.' But the new life didn't happen instantly. First their houses didn't sell and then, when they did, they struggled to find somewhere they could afford. In the end they found two adjoining houses. The woman in the corner shop tipped them off about the nearby land for sale. They bought it for \u00a340,000. </p> <p>They often wonder what Peter would think: his wife and daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, all living and working together off the land. On this they're all in agreement: he'd have been amazed. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.peterseden.com\">www.peterseden.com</a></p> <h2>The hobby farmers</h2> <p><strong>The urban couple who live the free-range lifestyle</strong></p> <p>Ask Shane Durston when he first thought about living off the land and he can pinpoint the exact moment 27 years ago. He grew up on council estates in Hackney and Catford. His parents were both 16 when he was born; five years later they broke up. By the time he was a teenager, he was getting into trouble with the police. Petty stuff, he recalls, like shoplifting. Finally he was given community service clearing up some woodland near where he lived. He was 15.</p> <p>'I thought it was rubbish,' he recalls. 'I thought I knew everything about everything.'</p> <p>But the quiet man who was in charge of the teenage boys for the day showed them where they could find wild mushrooms. Not only that, he picked some and took them back to his shed where he fried them in butter.</p> <p>'It stayed with me,' says Shane, 42. 'The idea of foraging, of the countryside, of getting something for nothing. There was this world out there I knew nothing about.' He stumbled across a copy of Food for Free by Richard Mabey in the library and started to find out more.</p> <p>It would be another 17 years, and one failed marriage, before he found someone who would share his dream. He met Emma at the Abbey National in Milton Keynes when she almost ran him over in the car park. He was working as an IT specialist; Emma was in the insurance department. 'I'd left school at 16, bought a house, got married, but it hadn't worked out,' says Emma, 35. 'I just sort of struggled on. </p> <p>I didn't know me. I didn't know what I wanted.' </p> <p>When the couple got together they started growing vegetables in their back garden (as well as clubbing, and driving a convertible and having foreign holidays. 'Oh, yes, we had all the toys,' says Shane). One day they went to a children's farm in Luton and, on the spur of the moment, came back with six pet hens.</p> <p>Five years on they're living in a modern three-bedroom house in a village called Spalding in Lincolnshire. The landscape is as flat as a dinner plate. The wind has a tendency to whistle through. On their 12 acres they have: 50 chickens (many of them rescued from battery farms), 14 Portland sheep, 10 pigs including Tamworths and Gloucester Old Spots, six ducks, five Dexter cows, five turkeys, two goats and two geese. Recently there's been a new addition to the menagerie. In the living room there's one baby boy, eight months. His name is Finley.</p> <p>There's a copy of John Seymour's updated classic The New Complete Book of Self Sufficiency on the coffee table. 'I don't mind the term hobby farmer,' says Shane. 'This is like my golf.' They have a small mortgage on the house which they bought for \u00a3250,000 as a result of a couple of judicious property deals in the Nineties: doing up houses and selling them on. </p> <p>'I'm a strong believer in mixing the new with the old,' says Shane. 'Look around: we've still got a big telly, but we've also got a wood-burning range. There is no reason why the two can't mix. Hobby farmer is an apt description: we mollycoddle our animals. They are a step down from pets.' Their pigs are named Del Boy, Rodney and Cassandra after the Trotter family in Only Fools and Horses</p> <p>At the moment Shane has dipped into their savings to take a year off work while Finley is a baby. But more usually you'd find them both ankle-deep in mud feeding and watering the animals at six in the morning before starting the hour-and-a-half drive into work. ('Helmets with torches on are invaluable,' says Emma.) All the jobs are shared, whether it's mucking out or taking the animals to the abattoir. They make a little extra money by advertising their pork from their website and selling jam and eggs at the gate. </p> <p>Emma loves the idea that they can sit down to a meal and know that everything they're about to eat they've either reared or grown from seed. Although not everyone agrees with her. One time some friends came to visit and when she served up one of their pigs as a roast ham their guests squeamishly pleaded to go to the pub for lunch instead. </p> <p>Ideally Shane would like to be able to cut back on his IT consultancy work and spend more time on the smallholding. He's built a biodiesel processor which means he can make 80 litres a day, all from waste vegetable oil. He hopes to run courses to show other people how to do it. Maybe, says Emma, they could do half-day chicken-keeping courses, too.</p> <p>'To be honest, if it meant that I could spend more time here,' Shane says, 'I'd flip burgers for a living. We both did our own thing before we met each other, but speaking for myself I am the happiest I have ever been.' Emma bounces Finley on her knees and nods in agreement. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.durston.co.uk\">www.durston.co.uk</a></p> <h2>The hardcore crofters</h2> <p><strong>The city professionals determined to be totally self-sufficient</strong></p> <p>Dennis and Linda Johnstone were up until 11.30 last night podding buckets of broad beans (or 'bloody broad beans' as Linda calls them) before boiling them up, blanching them, peeling them and popping them into recycled margarine boxes ready for the freezer. They toiled until Linda's fingers went black and she suggested they turn in for the night. She had to get up for the first day of the new term the following morning - she's a teacher at a nearby secondary school, and Dennis would be out in the rain at 6am feeding the pigs.</p> <p>The Johnstones may not be self sufficient, but they're as near as dammit. They live in a three-bedroom granite croft, with six acres attached, in the Aberdeenshire countryside, near a village called Insch. A Neolithic stone circle on the opposite side of the road suggests people have lived hereabouts for thousands of years. The mortgage - they bought the house in December 2003 for \u00a3200,000 - is paid by Linda's salary. Dennis, 42, stays at home to look after the house, and the youngest of their two sons, plus the vegetables and the livestock.</p> <p>He's grown enough potatoes to keep them going all year, the same goes for onions (he planted 1,200). They're rarely without the heavy-weight boxers of the veg patch - cabbage, kale, kohlrabi. Plus all the usual produce when it's in season. Most of the vegetables are grown in 14 beds on land which the previous owners used as a horse arena. Everything they don't eat immediately is frozen or pickled or made into chutney. Extra spuds are used for potato wine; spare apples, the ones that haven't been stewed and frozen, are turned into cider.</p> <p>They've whittled their weekly shopping bill for four of them down to \u00a335. 'Things like flour, oats, salt, vinegar, toilet rolls. The stuff we can't make ourselves,' says Dennis. 'The occasional exotic vegetable.' Like what? I wonder, imagining a yam or okra. 'Red peppers,' he replies.</p> <p>Dennis used to work in the media where he had all kinds of jobs from chief sub on Woman's Realm to a web specialist for the BBC to deputy editor on the Oxford Mail, but this is where he's always wanted to be ever since he grew up in Australia. 'I either wanted a farm, or a yacht.'</p> <p>At lunch time Linda, 45, pops back. She loves it here, but she's quicker than Dennis to admit it can be exhausting. 'It's like having a baby - you have no idea how hard it's going to be until you do it.' Early on, when everything kept going wrong, their friends suggested the croft might be cursed. The worst time was when their bore hole ran dry and Scottish Water refused to help them out. 'I can't remember how bad it was,' says Linda, while Dennis rustles up an omelette made with their eggs and fresh herbs, a salad from the garden. 'I've put it out of my mind.' For a month she had to shower at work and take the laundry into school. </p> <p>'It felt as though this place was fighting us,' she says. 'A lot of people who had lived here before had only lasted three or four years and at that point I thought I bloody well knew why.' The old days when she lived in Walthamstow and dressed in Nicole Farhi seemed a lifetime away. I wonder what her former colleagues in London would think. 'They'd be gobsmacked.'</p> <p>The neighbours thought they were 'mad eco hippies' when they moved in, according to Dennis. Maybe something to do with the fact that as far as possible he refuses to use any machinery. Three quarters of an acre of impacted earth destined for the potatoes was cultivated using a mattock and a crow bar; he cuts the grass with a scythe; he'd prefer to use a hoe over a tractor. 'It's a lot more satisfying,' he says. 'And it's also a money thing. Plus our carbon footprint. But we're definitely not hippies. What we're about is living more simply in a way that is satisfying to us and treading lightly at the same time.' Old nails are straightened out and used again. </p> <p>It helps, he adds, that he's bloody minded. </p> <p>'I work harder the grumpier I get,' he says. </p> <p>Solar panels mean they've cut their heating bills down. They ration their electricity consumption. The lights are turned off as much as possible. Dennis ferries the boys about on a Winther Kangaroo bike. The local police were amazed when he managed to do 26 miles an hour in a 20 mile-an-hour zone. </p> <p>Over time, the locals have come to respect the hard work they've put in. Their pedigree Berkshire weaners are snapped up when they put them up for sale. One of their ambitions is to help preserve the breed.</p> <p>'The locals know we're not dabbling,' says Dennis. 'They know we've got a mortgage. We're not like someone who has come here from the south of England and is living mortgage free and goes out to buy toy tractors and new land rovers.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dennis Johnstone's blog is at <a href=\"http://www.stonehead.wordpress.com\">stonehead.wordpress.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Phew. Just as I was starting to peer into shop windows and worry about whether trousers will have two legs again this season (and if they only have one whether that constitutes a skirt?), along comes the predictably prescriptive The One Hundred: A Guide to the Pieces Every Stylish Woman Must Own by a former fashion director of US Elle, Nina Garcia.<br>That title says it all - 'One hundred pieces every stylish woman must own' is not the same as 'One hundred stylish pieces every woman must own'. Stylish women may agree on the number of legs they prefer on a trouser, but random Everywoman is conceivably not remotely stylish and therefore needs to be told in no uncertains that her 100 pieces probably shouldn't comprise 50 pairs of control knickers, 20 wrongly sized bras, 10 pairs of jeans (really three, because four of them no longer fit and the others she wouldn't be seen dead in), five skirts (really two, etc), five frocks (yes...), one fleece, a black velvet cape, a burka, a Spanish flamenco dress (or is that just me?), three pairs of strange trousers (punk bondage? elephant cord? MC Hammer?...), a shroud and a teensy-weensy nurse's uniform...</p> <p>But fortunately Garcia hasn't taken her cue from my wardrobe, so it's a big-up for the Little Black Dress, the Crisp White Shirt, the pencil skirt (or for the fuller figure, what I like to call the 'crayon'), a tuxedo jacket, Ray-Ban Aviators, a wrap-dress and a pair of stilettos - all of which could make a non-controversial appearance in wardrobes as intriguingly diverse as those of Katie Price, Princess Anne and Helena Bonham Carter. And in the case of the latter, possibly all at once.</p> <p>But it's when we move on to the more esoteric additions that Garcia's prescriptive titular 'must' starts to sound at best optimistic, at worst deranged. Take her must-have red lipstick. I recently rediscovered an old favourite, Palomo Picasso's Mon Rouge, which I used to wear in the early Nineties accessorised by a power-bob and the job title 'Editrix' which made me feel great at 28, when I still had the skin of a 28-year-old, plus matching teeth. But lo - 15 years on and rather shockingly I was staring at Amy Winehouse after a heavy weekend and some radical lip-reduction surgery. So, without the benefit of Hollywood teeth and major cosmetic intervention, I fear my red lipstick days are over.</p> <p>And as for Garcia's essential push-up bra, I think there comes a point in a woman's life where she looks in the mirror and finds that Eva Herzigova has somehow been replaced by Eve Pollard. I have nothing but admiration for both Pollard and her magnificent embonpoint, but past a certain age I believe that great breasts, if one is fortunate enough to have them, are something to be revealed in an appropriate setting rather than being offered up like a plate of giant novelty vol-au-vents at a swingers' cocktail party. </p> <p>And how about the 'old concert T-shirt'? I can see that on Fearne Cotton an old Rolling Stones number might send out the message that in fact you can always get what you want, but if a middle-aged mother of two dons a baggy cotton rectangle advertising ELO's Balance of Power tour it is likely to say 'sad', 'pre-menstrual' and 'ELO may be having a retro-irony cool moment, but definitely not in their 1986 incarnation'. In short, it is likely that the kind of woman who purchases Garcia's book will be the person least likely to need it. </p> <p>Like every other woman I have ever met, I dream of a closet stuffed with clothes that: a) make me look and feel fabulous, always and forever; b) reference the current trends in an age and size-appropriate manner while also saying something ever-so-slightly profound to the rest of the world about who you are at any given moment; and c) whisper sweet nothings in your ear like a dream lover while easing the loneliness and pain of your darkest hours in the manner of the perfect no-strings best friend... </p> <p>Which, let's face it, whether we're talking Primark or Prada is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of even the smartest pair of three-legged trousers...

  "<p>Winning question: I'm going to throw out my make-up (bought on impulse and rarely worn) and start again. I want a small set of basics that I can wear every day, plus one or two products for evening glamour - I'm 32. I don't want to spend too much. What can you recommend? <br><strong>Elizabeth Read</strong></p> <p>This is a tall order without being able to see your face - shape, colouring, length of hair, et cetera. I was just working with a make-up artist on a photo shoot whose opinion was that only make-up base (foundation and concealer) and mascara were necessary to enhance the face. She is assuming that you will have tidied and shaped your eyebrows - vital, because they frame the face. </p> <p>My basic list would be: foundation, concealer, mascara, eyeliner or smoky brown/grey shadow, lip balm, lip gloss or lipstick, blusher, powder (loose for home) compact for handbag. I think eyebrows that are properly shaped and defined with a soft matching pencil (or you could use your brown eyeshadow if the shade was right) can mean that you make an impact with a minimum of make-up. Especially if you are naturally dark with a pale skin.</p> <p>Then I would add tools to your list because they are vital and worth spending more on. A good fat blusher brush with natural hair (choose a size that will fit into your make-up bag), a good pair of eyelash curlers (try Shiseido or Suuqu), and a compact with iridescent powder are three things I would invest in (professionals always use loose powder and a huge fat brush so that you can sweep the powder on but leave behind the lightest dusting). </p> <p>You can economise on foundation by choosing a stick formula but interestingly, I find the more expensive, big brand, liquid foundations last much longer because on good days you only need a tiny amount. You don't have to put foundation all over the face. The trick is to use it, like concealer, just on the areas that look grey, tired or uneven in colour. A smoky grey/brown eye shadow (Bobbi Brown is the master of these) is good for adding more glamour to the eyelids. You could even kill two birds with one stone by choosing a terracotta blusher (without sparkle) that you can use as eyeshadow, too. It's a colour that looks great on blue eyes and especially if you have a bit of tan.</p> <p>Then you need a blusher in a peachy or a light tan shade, a lip balm and a coloured lipstick. I have a friend who wears hardly any make-up but slaps on a really bright red lip for parties that just lifts her whole look. Really dark skin can look great subtly applied with a pink blusher. Make-up has to be learnt like speaking another language - the more you practise, the easier it is to make a few ingredients go a long way. </p> <p>You say you don't want to spend a lot, so you could buy all of these from Barbara Daly's range for Tesco. The prices are incredibly reasonable and her eye for the right shades and formulas comes from years of experience doing make-up on everyone from Mrs Thatcher to Princess Diana. But be careful picking foundations in the hideous fluorescent light common to most supermarkets. If possible you need to look at colours on your skin in daylight. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Is there a cheap, long-lasting nail varnish that doesn't chip? <br><strong>Jemima Owen</strong></p> <p>Manicurists I know each have their favourites but I find Mavala does pretty well. The truth is - it's a lot down to the preparation and application. You must use a base and a top coat and leave enough time for them all to dry. I remember once in LA I had my nails done by the Jessica, of Jessica nail varnishes. Apart from the immense care she took (not at all like slapping a coat on while you're watching TV as I might do) she put top coat on the insides and outsides of my nail tips. They looked perfect for more than a week. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you have to spend a lot of money on liquid eyeliners? The cheap ones I've tried so far flake off. <br><strong>Katie Seal</strong></p> <p>I recently had lunch with the creative director of Elle magazine and she was wearing Rimmel's Professional Liquid Eyeliner (\u00a34.29). It looked brilliant. She says it is great to use. Having said that, professional make-up artists always use cake eyeliner or a soft pencil to draw onto the lid as they say it's much easier to control. They often put a foundation or primer on the eye first, and powder the eyeliner after so that it doesn't smudge or move. Laura Mercier's is my favourite cake eyeliner, and Dior does great pencils, as does Bourjois, who I am always praising.</p> <h2>Kathy's hot products</h2> <p>This season's look involves a flawless skin and dramatic party eye make-up. Mineral make-up, which covers evenly and doesn't clog pores, is a new trend in foundation. These give you the look for less. From top: Mavala nail varnish, \u00a33.75, 01732 459412.

  "<p><em>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; </em></p> <p><em>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.</em></p> <p>This time last week everyone was still talking about the Olympics. Uplifting and occasionally awesome as that show was, much of the action from Beijing seemed choreographed rather than chaotic. Only right at the end, when a taekwondo competitor sensationally kicked a referee, was there a brief reminder that sport can deliver raw shock and drama as well as just spectacle. </p> <p>All through the Olympics the usual football-haters were chipping away at our national sport, bemoaning its behavioural standards and managing to present striving for medals as more noble and untainted, yet the last day of the summer transfer window has just shown why running and jumping and riding and rowing will never catch on. </p> <p>Quite simply, Beijing held no surprises to compared with the one Sir Alex Ferguson must have got when he heard Spurs had accepted a bid for Dimitar Berbatov from Manchester City. It is a great pity the look on the manager's face at that moment was not beamed live around the world to an audience estimated in the billions, but part of football's undying appeal is that it requires imagination on the part of the beholder and not just observation. Only what takes place on the pitch is available for close scrutiny; backstage details such as Fergie leaping into a car and abducting Berbatov at the airport have to be cherished in the mind's eye by fans and worked into folklore for the entertainment of future generations. </p> <p>Just as cherishable in their way would have been Peter Kenyon's reaction to learning Robinho had joined City and Mark Hughes coming in from the golf course to discover a \u00a332.5m Brazilian had been diverted his way. Kevin Keegan was furious when he concluded that Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise had been trying to sell his best players behind his back, and rightly so. Alan Curbishley was placed in the same untenable position by similarly hostile owners, but whereas the West Ham manager read the writing on the wall and opted out of an unhappy situation, Keegan has at least been able to take advantage of his massive popularity on Tyneside to make Ashley squirm.</p> <p>It has been reported that Ashley has been taken aback by the attitude of the fans, which is an incredible statement in itself. It can only mean the self-made billionaire must have imagined watching games in replica shirts and being caught on television having difficulty downing a pint of fizzy lager in a plastic glass was the sort of behaviour that would endear him to Newcastle supporters above a former player and manager and card-carrying Geordie legend who all too clearly is as emotionally tied to the club as the fans themselves. </p> <p>Rule one for any Newcastle owner is to keep the fans onside. Without a major trophy in almsot 40 years, and with no conspicuous optimism coursing through Tyneside at the moment, the fans, as Glenn Roeder has just remarked, are currently the only thing great about the club. It could be argued they are the only part of the Premier League equation to have kept their side of the bargain these past 10 years or so. </p> <p>Rule two for any Newcastle owner is not to welcome back Keegan as the returning Messiah then appoint a team of London-based suits to crucify him with decisions over his head. Obvious, really, though perhaps not for an owner who thinks he could win a popularity contest against Keegan.</p> <p>Rule three is when in a hole stop digging, and take the Arab money when it is offered. That is exactly what Thaksin Shinawatra has just done, making a decent profit on his investment and securing himself a role as honorary president with the blessing of Manchester City fans; yet Newcastle, too, were on the Abu Dhabi United Group's radar along with other possibly-for-sale targets including Arsenal and Liverpool. </p> <p>No business resulted because Arsenal said they would not countenance a foreign takeover, while Liverpool were temporarily unattractive as they awaited a new stadium. Newcastle would have been ideal, but the prices did not match. The City takeover cost Adug \u00a3210m for a well-supported team in a modern new stadium in a well-connected football city. Newcastle - great stadium, great fans, but bit of a way out for attracting the world's best players - might have been available for a price in the region of \u00a3400m. Apparently it did not take too long for Adug to make up their minds. Just as well, as it turned out, because they still had Robinho to buy before the transfer deadline and the opportunity to give United the fright of their lives over Berbatov. </p> <p>Now that Noel Gallagher is making jokes about United fans inadvertently boosting the City kitty every time they fill up at the petrol station and, in perhaps the biggest wet-fish-around-the-chops shock of a truly staggering week, the City fans in our pub have started revising their opinion of Cristiano Ronaldo. Now he is no longer a cheating, preening, rudeword rudeword sexual slur, but the stake that City are going to drive through the hearts of United supporters. 'If he leaves them and comes to us we'll love him for ever,' a City fan in the pub said to your correspondent. 'Well, he practically left United anyway in the summer. All he needs to do now is choose us above Real Madrid, and that shouldn't be too hard.' </p> <p>Truly, to be tired of football at the minute is to be tired of life, though it is permissable to feel a bit sorry for Everton, who have just smashed their transfer record without anyone noticing, and for their chairman, Bill Kenwright, who had to stand up at a shareholders' meeting and apologise for not being a billionaire. </p> <p>It goes without saying that everyone is feeling sorry for the happy band of brothers that used to be the Toon Army. There will be more hard luck stories by the end of the season, probably more by the end of the month, but what has happened in the past few days is not as cataclysmic as people have been trying to make out. Keegan has quit before. Phone-ins prompted by the Eastlands takeover entitled 'The Day That Football Died' would have been better aired a year ago, when Thaksin's ugly money was sponsoring the initial City revival. Ostensibly all that has happened since is that the baton has been passed to people who actually have wads of the folding stuff to spend, rather than warrants for their arrest and frozen assets in Thailand.</p> <p>The gap between the haves and have nots in the Premier League possibly just got bigger, but as it was unbridgeable in the first place what is the worst that can happen? Chelsea not getting everything their own way? Liverpool and Arsenal finding it tougher to stay in the top four? Most people would applaud those developments. </p> <p>Call me pessimistic, but I don't really think Adug will be splurging \u00a3135m on landing Ronaldo anyway. Or being in an almighty rush to make City the biggest team on the planet. No one in their right mind would put Ronaldo and Robinho in the same team, because even if two slightly flaky egotists could be accommodated the sheer number of stepovers on show would put most people off.</p> <p>Could it not be possible that Adug have simply done their homework and identified winding up United as a core City activity? They did let Berbatov join their rivals, after all. If they were willing to outbid Chelsea then they could have tried to outbid United as well, or at least launched a complaint over Ferguson's role in scuppering their deal.</p> <p>Obviously if Kaka, Fernando Torres and Rio Ferdinand arrive in the January transfer window I will have to revise that opinion, but if Adug are going to go to that sort of expense then surely it would have made more sense to buy Manchester United outright and start from there. One gets the idea the Glazer family would not reject the idea out of hand if money really was no object. But doing the obvious thing would be a bit boring, as would pumping City so full of money and star players they become hated playground bullies rather than lovable losers. </p> <p>If Adug have understood that City can be both popular and successful by picking up more neutral support than either United or Chelsea, then fair play to them. If the object of the exercise is to promote Abu Dhabi and come across as the acceptable face of unimaginable wealth then you wouldn't necessarily want to reinvent yourself as the new Chelsea. </p> <p>Everyone seems to be getting a teeny bit over-excited here because it was Chelsea who were gazumped, forgetting that Robinho was a player Real Madrid were trying to move on and that City scattergunned a few more attacking targets as deadline day approached.</p> <p>Since being dropped by Fabio Capello, Robinho was rarely central to Real's plans. The idea that Chelsea were trying to prise away one of the Bernabeu's most prized assets is a little wide of the mark; it is much more the case that Real were trying to get as much money out of Chelsea as possible, as everyone does. It is also unlikely that Roman Abramovich could have rescued the deal by bidding a little higher. Luiz Felipe Scolari seems to feel a good player was lost for want of a few more million, whereas Abramovich probably had a shrewd idea Adug would not back off. </p> <p>The point is that even had Robinho ended up at Stamford Bridge he would have been viewed as an overpriced and slightly risky capture, and there is no guarantee he will flourish at City, where Hughes can hardly be expected to be quite as simpatico to a young Brazilian as Scolari. </p> <p>City have not changed the world with one signing, but, as they were in the top four as late as Christmas last season, and have since added Robinho, Jo, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta and Tal Ben Haim to their squad, they must have a decent chance of a Champions League finish this time. A better chance than Tottenham, at the very least.</p> <p>Liverpool and Arsenal must be quite worried. It is hard to see why anyone else should be. How can the most exciting league in the world possibly be scared of Manchester City? Even revamped and refinanced, they are still Manchester City. </p> <p>One can understand a certain resentment at the way a once working-class activity has became a roped-off area for multimillionaires.</p> <p>Spending power is all that counts now, and where's the fun in that? You don't get a roar from the terraces when a chequebook is opened or a tingle of anticipation when a new chairman stretches his legs under the boardroom table. But, let's be honest, this is not new. We've been putting up with it for some time, and football seems to have survived. Owners are the new stars; get over it. Managers have had their day. </p> <p>No one is saying this is a sensible or a fair way to run things. If you want sensible and fair you can go to Germany, and almost no one from outside that country does. A time might come soon when the Premier League becomes so vertically uncompetitive that rules have to be brought in against debt or private ownership, as already happens in other countries, though before we strangle the golden goose it is as well to remember we are talking about a small corner of the entertainment industry. Not life and death.</p> <p>English football's popularity might be spiralling out of control, but no one is forced to join in, even if good people such as Curbishley and Keegan are being forced out. And we are being entertained. If it's sport you're looking for, there's always the Olympics.</p>",
  "<p>The reputation of the Scots as a hard-drinking, hard-fighting nation is not one that I am proud of. In Scotland, we have a particular problem with alcohol - a culture of drinking to get drunk. In this, we are by no means unique; other countries are also suffering the effects of alcohol misuse. But we are taking action and we sent a very clear signal last week that we will not be diverted from tackling this issue. As the First Minister said, we will introduce legislation this parliamentary term to bring in tough measures designed to turn the tide on irresponsible drinking. </p> <p>The detail of exactly what those measures will be is still being worked on. Our consultation - on minimum pricing, banning irresponsible promotions in off-sales, introducing a social responsibility fee and raising the age for the purchase of alcohol in off-sales - finishes this week. </p> <p>Some people may think we can be persuaded not to go ahead, but that is simply not the case. We have a problem that's costing us at least \u00a32.25bn a year, flooding our health service, undermining our economy and filling up our jails. The case for action is clear.</p> <p>There has been speculation that some retailers will seek ways to get round the measures. There is a suggestion, for example, that they may simply put marketing budgets into internet sales, driving customers to buy alcohol through irresponsible deals on the web which will then be delivered to their home from stores elsewhere. </p> <p>This is coupled with tales of huge distribution hangars that will be set up near the border to flood Scotland with cheap drink from England - lorries covering vast chunks of the country with the three for two deals that may be outlawed here. </p> <p>We recognise that we alone can't stop this. Neither can we alone stop other rumoured ways round our tough action on alcohol. Take bootlegging as another example: the white van man travelling to supermarkets in England and stocking up on cheap alcohol to sell behind a pub in the East End of Glasgow. It makes a change from people going from the South Coast to Calais, but that doesn't make it right and it doesn't mean we shouldn't take action.</p> <p>Much of this may be scaremongering by vested interests to try and lead us to the conclusion that we might as well not bother. But that is simply not an option. We can't legislate to stop some of these things, but we're determined to press ahead with our radical plans and look for support where we can.</p> <p>I believe that cross-border co-operation is important. Alcohol misuse doesn't stop at the border. I don't believe that there's not a problem in Carlisle or Newcastle the same as there is in Dumfries or Edinburgh. </p> <p>I want to work with our colleagues in the UK government to build on what we're doing in Scotland and make sure people can't exploit the situation and undermine our drive for tough action. Clearly the UK government's approach is slightly different, so are English and Welsh licensing laws. But they are still committed to tackling alcohol misuse and I want to work with them and make sure the whole of the United Kingdom benefits.</p> <p>Similarly, I know that many supermarkets and retailers recognise the problem with alcohol in Scotland and I welcome that. Many of them have brought in measures to become more responsible sellers of alcohol - Challenge 25 and delisting some very cheap high-strength products in some of their stores. These moves are definitely a step in the right direction.</p> <p>We are not anti-alcohol. We are anti-alcohol misuse. It's not the drink, it's how we are drinking it. I want to work with the industry to encourage more responsible consumption, promotion and retailing. But that must be in conjunction with further regulatory measures. </p> <p>We need to change the culture around alcohol in Scotland. We need to rebalance our relationship with alcohol and the time is right to do that. In my view, this is similar to the change in attitudes to smoking. Fifty years ago, smoking was a social norm - on the bus, in the cinema and in bars. It's not any more. </p> <p>At the time banning smoking in public places was being considered, the tobacco industry criticised governments for taking action, saying, for example, that there was insufficient evidence of its effects or that legislation wouldn't work - some of the same arguments we hear about alcohol today. But it did work with smoking. Culture change took time, but we now have a very different attitude to smoking. I believe it can work with alcohol misuse. I believe it's worth a try. </p> <p>The scale of the problem in Scotland is too great to sit back and do nothing. So I will to work with my colleagues in Westminster and those who sell alcohol. I will take tough action. I will stand up and be counted and try to make Scotland safer, stronger and healthier.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kenny MacAskill is the Cabinet Secretary for Justice</p>",
  "<p>The story of Milly, an eight-year-old cat who disappeared out of window in Whitstable two weeks ago, has much to tell us about the petty-minded forces that have come to replace proper policing in this country. Her owners, Stephen and Heather Cope and their son Daniel, 13, searched high and low for Milly, then, failing to find her, did what any normal person would do: put up posters to see if anyone had seen her. The next thing they heard was from one of the local council community wardens, who rang the telephone number on the poster and threatened them with a \u00a380 on-the-spot fine for antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>Seldom can there have been a more officious, twerpish enforcement of the law, but this kind of action is now one of the established parts of this dreadful government's legacy. As the police retreat from the streets, we are prey to every type of snoop, informant, busybody and vindictive martinet, all of them licensed by the government's accreditation scheme so that they may demand our names and addresses, photograph us, check car tax discs and seize alcohol, issue fines for truancy, rowdiness, graffiti and dog fouling.</p> <p>In Colchester, litter wardens are taking pictures of alleged offenders to publish them in the local paper. One local council has been reported as using officials to check car numbers outside homes to see who is sleeping with whom, for God knows what purpose. Children as young as eight are among 5,000 private citizens across the country recruited as paid 'covert human intelligences sources'.</p> <p>The speed with which our dear, familiar democracy is vanishing under the weight of totalitarian pettiness is appalling and one wonders when this easygoing nation will rise against the trends set so blithely by that authoritarian basket case Tony Blair and continued by mediocrities such as Hazel Blears and Jacqui Smith.</p> <p>Even police officers have doubts about the blurring of lines between uniformed officers of the law, whom we know to have received standard training, and these upstarts and busybodies wearing red-and-white prefect's badges. Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation said on the BBC recently that the public would not understand why someone with a 'small badge was telling them what to do'. He added: 'I think it's going to lead to confrontation.' </p> <p>I hope it does, because only then will people begin to understand what we have allowed Labour do to our society with its informer networks and child spies. Only then will we begin to question the right of a nightclub bouncer with 20 hours' training and maybe a criminal record lurking in the background to challenge citizens and issue fines. </p> <p>The mystery in all this is: where are the police? Since Labour came to power, the police have basked in the sun, though, like farmers, they always complain about their lot. The facts are these. Between 1997 and 2007, spending on law and order rose by a half a percentage point to 2.5 per cent of GDP. Last year, the criminal justice system received \u00a322.7bn, about \u00a315.13bn of which went to the police. In the past decade, the police have received a budget increase of 21 percent and the police workforce rose by 50,000, which includes an extra 15,000 officers.</p> <p>To put these figures in perspective, we spend more on law and order than any other OECD country including the United States, France, Germany and Spain. It is fair to say that Britain is in the grip of law and order obsession, yet we seem incapable of putting police officers on the beat to patrol our streets, investigate crimes and keep order with an eye to proportionate and sensible use of their powers. By that, I do not mean three officers on mountain bikes pursuing a colleague on his racer through crime-ridden Hackney to issue him with a \u00a330 fine because he had avoided dangerous roadworks by briefly using the pavement. I don't mean texting the victim of a burglary, as happened to a friend of mine, to see if she had anything more to report. </p> <p>Despite crime figures going down, we continue to spend more and lock up proportionately more people than any other free country. The most recent figures for London show falls of 14 per cent in both knife and gun crime and a 7 per cent reduction in violent crime generally. Since 1997, the official figures for the country claim a drop in the crime rate of 35 per cent. Academics suggest this figure is hugely inflated, but the downward trend is undeniable and could be claimed by Labour as a victory for its policies were it not for its sinister need to keep us in a state of permanent fear about crime.</p> <p>The estimable Cherie Booth put her finger on the problem and inadvertently (perhaps) provided a grand analysis of her husband's cynical use of crime to push his authoritarian programme. On the release of a very good report from the Howard League for Penal Reform attacking the government's policy of building Titan prisons, which will hold 2,500 brutalised souls, she used the word 'punitive' a lot and referred to 'the hysterical rhetoric of politicians attempting to ride the tiger of public opinion'. Or what is perceived as public opinion, she added.</p> <p>We have forgotten all our empirical skills when it comes to law and policing. Instead of assessing what the problems are - the fact that prisons do not reform offenders, that crime is caused by complex social issues as much as by individual moral failure, that police officers at their desks or in squad cars do not deter crime as well as those on the beat - we have allowed a blind and vengeful regime to skew our sense of reason and what is right for a liberal democracy. </p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, also came out with an excellent report last week, which attacked the creation by Labour of 3,600 new offences - nearly one for each day in power - and pointed out that England and Wales had experienced an 11 per cent drop in crime at the same time as an incredible 45 per cent increase in the prison rate. </p> <p>Last week, the prison population reached 83,000. The conclusion is clear: we are sending too many of the wrong people to prison and for too long. This impression was supported by the Chief Constable of Kent, Mike Fuller, a contender to succeed the besieged Ian Blair at the Met. He complained last week that his force was 'over-inspected' and that officers were demoralised because sentencing policy was dictated by availability of places in prisons. Criminals who deserved prison were avoiding jail.</p> <p>Huhne's report nails the politics behind the degraded policy of banging up more and more people. When Blair took over the Labour's home affairs brief in 1992, he skilfully moved on to the traditional law and order territory occupied by the Tories and so began a policy war in which the main parties tried to best each other with, as Cherie Booth put it, 'the hysterical rhetoric about crime'. David Cameron's hyperbole about a broken society and Dominic Grieve's announcement about new surveillance powers for police are both part of this competitive pessimism about our society.</p> <p>So let us start thinking logically about crime, punishment, policing and the cause of our problems. Let us end this punitive regime. Let us put policemen back on the beat, throw the likes of Jacqui and Hazel out of office and return all their spies and accredited jobsworths to the twilight of their power-crazed fantasy lives.<br><a href=\"mailto:henry.porter@observer.co.uk\"><br>henry.porter@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Should Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture be judged by the ripples it causes beyond the Wirral? The odd burst of Merseyside gaiety has registered on the national radar. I remember Ringo doing his bit, though perhaps only because he said something unflattering on TV afterwards. McCartney came and went, and then there was Klimt at the Tate, and of course Simon Rattle. No doubt there have been hundreds of excellent under-reported smaller events, vibrant and eye-catching in their way, and, yes, visitors have been flocking in to enjoy the docks and museums and parks and dancing in the street, helping to celebrate the city's proud achievements and history and enduring distinctive character. But where, you wonder, is the one big unmissable thing - the thing to boggle the collective mind? Where is the 'blimey' factor of Liverpool 08? </p> <p>Perhaps this is it. It's Wednesday morning and commuters are staring up at something dangling from a derelict 15-storey office block next to Lime Street Station. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Not with those legs. No, having tried a couple of Beatles, the moment has come for Liverpool to - ahem - roll out its spider. But this is no wee, cowering, timorous beastie. It weighs 37 tonnes and stands 50ft tall. It will remain here for the rest of the day. At night they'll have the searchlights on it, and on Thursday 'scientists' will crane it off and haul it across town. On Friday the spider will awake, beginning what promises to be 'the biggest, most spectacular piece of street theatre ever seen in the UK'... </p> <p>The idea is that the spider has emerged from the cobwebby recesses of this partly demolished building, providing a notional thread, as it were, between the ongoing celebrations and Liverpool's renaissance. But if it could talk, it wouldn't be in a Scouse accent. Rewind several weeks, to Nantes in northern France. It's a warm day and I'm wandering the site of the city's former shipyards on a sliver of an island in the Loire, a place, like Britain's own post-industrial centres, assuming a new shape and purpose with its ambient rumble of earthmovers and gentle breeze of civic awakening. Things are afoot on this grid of dusty streets lined with abandoned factory units, planted with saplings. There's a Banksy-style bit of graffiti art depicting a woman holding a chainsaw; up ahead a modish slab of office space; further, a little of the brutalist block housing much loved by the French, greenery hanging from the balconies. It has the air of a neighbourhood waiting for cool people to move in, followed by galleries, studios, hip bars, cake shops, estate agents. </p> <p>Central to all this - the magnet that has set everything twitching, and home to Liverpool's spider - are the workshops of Les Machines de l'Ile. They are busy with visitors - in the sunny caf\u00e9, exploring the high reaches of a huge fabricated tree-branch that sprouts out of the primary-coloured warehouses, or below, on the riverside concourse, admiring the merry-go-round with its winged horses and chameleons. Les Machines is the company charged with constructing a public spectacle here among the ghosts of the city's port heritage, a monumental long-term project funded out of the municipal purse, beefed up with regional and EU money. The designer and creative force is Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re, the man who also dreamed up the awesome mechanical elephant that came lumbering through the centre of London two summers ago. That project - The Sultan's Elephant - was produced by Royal de Luxe, a long-established Nantes-based theatrical company. Nantes itself seethes with impresarios of one sort or another (30-odd performing organisations in a place the size of Southampton), nurtured by an arts-loving administration that has put culture at the heart of the city's revival. If Liverpool wants something special, it has come to the right place. Inside the high workshops, the spider (dubbed La Princesse) is still being knocked into shape - a huge thing, its arrangement of hydraulics and cables and chrome levers exposed, a half-dozen mechanics clambering about up there with their spanners and chisels, others perched amid the wooden and metal armour of its great pod and folded legs, and not a hard hat in sight. Health and Safety? Pah!</p> <p>It seems unfeasibly complicated. You'd think they'd have robots to do this kind of thing, but no, it's like walking into a Stella ad - small-town 1950s Peugeot factory, sunlight raking the inner darkness, air scented with WD40 and glue and rubber and coffee and Gitanes, the hiss of pneumatic equipment, beautiful grubby women with welding torches and ill-cut hair, grease guns. It's all here bar the Tour de France whizzing by outside. </p> <p>Delarozi\u00e8re arrives and shows me round. He's a bit grubby himself, with chic pointy sideburns and the kind of wild eyes and aura of having been up half the night inventing that geniuses have. He enthuses about the Nantes development, still embryonic but open since last year to the public (for a few euros you can ride on his amazing elephant - a modified build of the London one - or inspect the new machines as they emerge from the workshop into the viewing gallery). 'There is no project like this in the world,' he says, showing me a model for an unimaginably immense tree topped by a pair of herons carrying baskets of passengers. Each heron alone will weigh 15 tonnes!</p> <p>And how about Liverpool? 'To have a piece like the spider in a city makes people see the place differently. It makes you pay attention to the space. When the big machine moves, you look at the architecture too. A building with the spider on it becomes a new object. It's like a theatre set.'</p> <p>We make our way around. There's a thrum of motors. A girl, dreadlocked and wearing goggles, is hammering a piece of metal. Another comes by, trailing a palette truck containing unidentifiable limbs. A man is marking wood with one of those big square pencils. In a few weeks' time, he says, these craftspeople - engineers, metalworkers, carpenters - will be doubling as performance artists and manipulateurs, attending and working the spider as it weaves through Liverpool. </p> <p>The work here seems more like a way of life, I say - like joining a circus. 'Yes, sure,' he says. 'We think, 70 per cent of our life is work, so it is better to make this time pleasant and constructive. People come here, I hope, to make some adventure!'</p> <p>We look round the gallery. The next big project will be a 25-metre high 'deep sea' carousel. Here's a squid and a crab and one of those big terror fish with all the teeth and bulging eyes. All feature Delarozi\u00e8re's trademark materials - unpainted wood and metal - with all the workings exposed, the levers and pulleys, the gears, chains and shafts, the myriad articulated muscles and joints. Everything looks like the work of a single mad inventor. It's quite fantastic. </p> <p>All the pieces start with a drawing, says Delarozi\u00e8re, indicating the detailed hand-drawn blueprints (think Jules Verne via Leonardo and Heath Robinson) on the wall. 'We work in the same way a painter does - if he wants to paint a body, he thinks about the bones under the skin to make it real. So we also think first about what is inside. We add layers. Then it is technical too. The object we are building becomes a kind of sculpture, with everything visible - the engine, the people who are controlling it.'</p> <p>We step outside, where the elephant is returning from its peregrinations around local streets, its trunk swaying and probing, its great leather ears flapping gently, its knee pistons flagrantly on display. It's the size of a building, but the really startling power of Delarozi\u00e8re's creations lies in their movement, which is intricate and nuanced in a way that makes them seem alive against the evidence of our own eyes that it's all just hardware and people pulling strings. 'This is the theatre of the machine,' he says. 'It is spectacular because of the movement. The movement is a show in itself. It creates the emotions.'</p> <p>The group that brought Delarozi\u00e8re's elephant to London two years ago - and has been commissioned by Liverpool to stage the spider event - is Artichoke, a creative production company run by Helen Marriage and Nicky Webb. When we meet, the two women are full of war stories about staging the elephant show - not least resistance from the authorities. </p> <p>'When we wanted to close central London, the prevailing opinion was: \"Why would we do that?\"' says Marriage. 'And yet they close central London all the time - for royal occasions, marathons, sporting triumphs, George Bush. None of these things are to do with art or culture. Someone had to step up and say: \"We have a place here, too.\" In the end it was the drip of persuasion that did it - 25 authorities, one by one. They asked why we didn't do it in Battersea Park, but the point about this work is that it is disruptive - that the city changes and comes to a standstill. There's no point doing it in a park!' </p> <p>'It's the same with Liverpool,' says Webb. 'We're putting it into the absolute centre of the city. For the authorities it's a huge pain in the arse, but that's the point.' </p> <p>The difference with Liverpool, of course, is that they have asked for it, having seen millions amazed by the London elephant. 'They wanted something with the same impact,' says Marriage. 'Something that was free, something to bring their communities together and something that wasn't about football or the Beatles - something that was cultural and powerful and on a scale that nobody could imagine. But the negotiations were still incredibly difficult. The structures themselves are huge, the disruption is enormous, you have to stop the traffic, close stations, reroute buses. It's a big ask.' </p> <p>Six weeks after Nantes, secret rehearsals for the spider are under way at the old Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, with its acres of wasteland. It was the biggest site they could find, Webb says - and the owners let them have it for nothing! Plus it's a home from home for the French, who are here creaking about on bicycles - well, those of them not already in the French-run canteen (a converted boiler room), tucking into steak frites. To the clatter of knives and forks, Webb tells me about the 16 whopping cranes, eight cherrypickers, six forklifts, 250 crew, 26 musicians needed to get the spider on the road. And the red tape! She has a file as thick as a docker's neck full of risk assessments, planning authorisations, details of road closures and removal of traffic lights - every nitpicking contingency for every centimetre of the route. 'You have to document it all. There's no agreed procedure for an event like this. You have to invent it.'</p> <p>Outside the ship-shed - rumbling with generators, sparks flying from angle grinders - the spider is shaking a leg (and, in turn, its others), watched by techies. It looks a bit stiff but eventually they have it walking, its progress tentative. It's not the scampering sort - more like one of those horrors you find stalking across your bath towel on a cold morning. Delarozi\u00e8re is here, standing with a stopwatch as they try to get it under a 'low' obstacle that, on the day, will be the Mersey Tunnel. I ask if he's nervous. 'Of course. This is the time now when one year of work is in one single moment. If you miss it... But I have a good feeling.' He smiles.</p> <p>I go and watch the spider from a distance, the better to marvel at its finely graded movements - the product of Delarozi\u00e8re's forensic study of the way spiders express themselves, translated into God knows how many permutations of hand-worked hydraulics. Through half-closed eyes the spider seems besieged by little people. If this were a movie, they'd be trying to subdue it with pitchforks. </p> <p>Behind me, under cover of a small marquee, the musicians are being conducted through the score, moving at a jaunty clip with busy bassoons, parping horns, plinking strings. It's a bit jazzy. One imagines Jacques Tati falling on his face to it. The maestro looks slightly under the cosh. For the past week he has been sleeping in a camp bed alone on site, for inspiration. You can't imagine Simon Rattle doing that.</p> <p>It's Friday morning and I'm outside the Echo Arena in Liverpool city centre opposite Albert Dock. It has been pouring with rain since dawn but the crowds are out in force, massing in the bowl between the buildings, up against the barrier, waiting for the spider to wake up. The musicians, high on forklifts and cherrypickers around the square, are beginning to drone. Fire bursts from rusty mortars, the manipulateurs climb into position, the band begins its sombre overture, and at last the spider stirs, its eyes flittering, its great legs probing the sea of umbrellas and cameraphones. But what now... why, it seems to be rising and coming forwards, but - ha, ha, surely not - because how can it, surrounded by the crowd in this confined space with old people and baby buggies to trip over? But stewards are asking us to move back and it's not until now that we really get it - the beast is actually coming up the steps, and it isn't going to stop! I don't know if this is stage management or crowd control, but it's a truly brilliant stroke. </p> <p>Now the special effects people are trying to hold it back with high pressure hoses and someone high above treats us to a sudden, massive deluge. A young man in a dripping business suit (he seems to have closed his umbrella at just the wrong moment) can't believe it: 'I only popped down here for a minute - I've got a meeting to go to. But this is just fantastic.' He looks like he's just swum the Mersey.</p> <p>At the top of the steps the spider is brought to a halt by a barrage of the most deafening firecrackers I have ever heard, leaving the scene in fog. 'Oh my God, that's amazing,' says one woman to me, her eyes like saucers, and then suddenly... 'But where's my mother?'</p> <p>The spider reverses and slowly retraces its steps. Snow is drifting now, and the spider, quieted, moves the crowd to silence, until the music - brilliantly responsive throughout - dies at last, triggering long applause.</p> <p>The rain is still pouring. This is Liverpool's 'blimey' moment, for sure. I don't think I've ever seen so many smiling faces on so many wet people. La Princesse will be off again this evening, ahead of the big procession through the city and grand finale this weekend. I can't imagine the size of the following crowd by then, but one thing's certain - and I'm afraid someone has to say it - she'll never walk alone.</p> <h2>Capital of culture: Still to come</h2> <p><strong>The Liverpool Philharmonic, 2 Oct </strong> <br>Sir Simon Rattle returns to conduct at the concert hall where his career began. </p> <p><strong>King Lear, 30 Oct-29 Nov </strong><br>Rupert Goold directs Pete Postlethwaite in the title role at the Everyman Theatre. </p> <p><strong>Ai Weiwei, 20 Sep-30 Nov </strong><br>New work from the Chinese artist and architect as part of the Liverpool Biennial's Made Up exhibition. </p> <p><strong>Guy Barker's Jazz Orchestra, 25 Sep </strong><br>Guy Barker presents dZf, a 'jazz noir' reworking of Mozart's Magic Flute. </p> <p><strong>Hope Street Festival, 8-14 Sep </strong><br>Street theatre, market stalls and 'happenings'.</p>",
  "<p>When the actor Henry Irving died just over a century ago, the country mourned him with muffled drums, a state funeral and black bows on London cabs. He reappeared shortly afterwards in a series of revivals put on by his son, HB Irving, who found himself 'being upstaged' in all his father's old parts 'by a powerful, unseen presence, grave, ironic, crafty'. Scarier still was the transformation scene in an adaptation of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, where audiences watched HB Irving as Jekyll taken over night after night by the sardonic, thin-lipped spectre of Henry Irving as Hyde in what appeared, to the actor's terrified wife, 'as a possession rather than a performance'.</p> <p>In his Strange Eventful History, Michael Holroyd seems to have been possessed by not one but six characters in search of a biographer. Henry Irving and his two sons contend for control of these pages with Ellen Terry, her daughter and her son, the actor and director Edward Gordon Craig, who owed far more to Irving than to his own absconding father. Irving and Craig dominate proceedings now as then. Both were magnetic characters, elusive, commanding, recklessly competitive and impossible to live with or, for that matter, without.</p> <p>Holroyd's book encapsulates their solitary essence in symbolic endpapers. One shows Irving in Robespierre. The play was a 'one-man piece', as Ellen Terry said tartly: 'Henry, and over 250 supers.' The other shows an austere pillared vista framing Craig's Hamlet, the role he identified with more than any other, in a production designed to reduce the rest of the cast to figments of his own dream, the first step towards a director's theatre that would eliminate 'the insuperable difficulty and expense' of actors altogether.</p> <p>Irving, too, dealt in dreams. He thought nothing of constructing an entire Gothic cathedral on stage at the Lyceum Theatre, installing a bluebell wood or hiring the Brigade of Guards to fight his mock battles. For Goethe's Faust, he had 400 ropes backstage, each with its own name and function, to raise devils, spirits and apparitions. He obliterated his actors under sumptuous costumes, obstructed them with cumbersome scenery and blinded them with bolts of lightning. Craig did much the same in a virtual theatre that rarely used more than three plain grey canvas walls and a pool of coloured light.</p> <p>Neither cramped his style by paying much attention to texts. 'The omission of passages, the modification of certain words or phrases and the transposition of scenes,' Irving wrote of Shakespeare's plays, 'are all absolutely necessary before they can be acted.' 'Disembowelled, decapitated, dismembered' was a contemporary playwright's account of his work directed by Craig. Both were totalitarian dictators. If Irving embodied the theatre of his day like no other actor before or since, Craig's vision of the future transfixed 20th-century directors from Stanislavsky and Max Reinhardt to Jean-Louis Barrault and Peter Brook.</p> <p>Between them stood Ellen Terry, who treated the entire world on and off stage as her theatre. The one period when she couldn't act - the few years of her catastrophic marriage as a child bride to the celebrity painter GF Watts - reduced her to a silent shadow, 'thin as paper and white as a ghost, with drowned eyes ... like a broken-backed bird'. </p> <p>Irving brought her to life as no one else could. 'How delighted Shakespeare would have been to see Ellen Terry perform such an Ophelia,' he said at the start of their partnership in 1878, when she was 31. Two decades later, she seems younger and fresher than ever before to Henry James, who saw her as Imogen in Cymbeline. In her 60th year, the stage collapsed before her 'like a house of cards' as she played Shaw's heroine in Captain Brassbound's Conversion. 'It was as if someone drew a bow over a ripe, richly seasoned cello,' Virginia Woolf wrote of her voice. 'It grated, it glowed and it grumbled. Then she stopped speaking. She put on her glasses. She gazed intently at the back of the settee. She had forgotten her part. But did it matter?'</p> <p>Frankly, no. The core of this book is the transforming power of pure imagination. For more than 20 years, Terry and Irving acted out the nation's subliminal desires and urges, keeping a special chair in the Lyceum's prompt corner for the Prime Minister to drop in after work, performing privately for the Queen at Windsor Castle, dining with the President in the White House, commanding wherever they went storms and swells of public emotion on a scale almost inconceivable today. </p> <p>Compared to the passionate inner authenticity of their professional careers, the highly eventful private lives of Holroyd's subjects seem relatively pallid and so do their hangers-on. Irving's wife and mistresses remained for all practical purposes bit parts, like Terry's husbands and lovers, or the many women Craig impregnated and abandoned in a lifelong bid to avenge himself by re-enacting the betrayals of a father he never met. Practicality, feasibility, the banalities of everyday actuality barely impinged on any of Holroyd's six characters, including Terry's daughter, Edith Craig, who ended up running her own theatre in Kent. 'She had the ability to uncover people's unacted parts,' writes Holroyd, and the same might be said of his own uncanny powers of balance, perception and penetration in a multiple biography that somehow recaptures an ephemeral imaginative reality more intense to its subjects and their public than life itself.</p>",
  "<p>Cash-strapped families facing budget-busting fuel bill rises could be hit with 'catch-up' bills of hundreds of pounds on estimated meter readings that have left them underpaying for gas and electricity.</p> <p>Ahead of an expected government package this week to help low-income families cope with recent double-digit increases in energy bills, households are being advised to check their bills to see if they have been paying just the estimate or the actual meter reading. In worst-case scenarios, companies could demand the difference between previous estimated readings and actual consumption, forcing households to go into debt to find the extra money.</p> <p>Under current legislation, suppliers are only required to take an actual meter reading once every two years - and even then are only required to make 'reasonable endeavours' to do so. While some try to take actual readings more frequently, there is no unanimity among suppliers and the majority of a customer's billing will be based on estimates.</p> <p>'The way things are going, consumers are looking at a hefty price increase pretty much every six months,' warns a spokesman from consumer body Energywatch. 'If you have not had your meter read for 18 months, say, there could have been at least three price increases in that time. Unless you are keenly aware of the gas and electricity bill increases, any shortfall will come as a terrible shock, especially in the face of other rising household costs.'</p> <p>Crucially, customers who have not received a bill based on actual readings since September 2006 should double-check that their 'catch-up' bill is properly broken down, with all the charges being made at the correct price levels, not all levied at the current highest rate. </p> <p>Cash readers have complained about 'catch-up' bills where every charge spanning a period of months related to the new, highest price rather than the older, cheaper units of power; only after time and money spent arguing on the telephone has the provider relented. </p> <p>'You must pay for what you have used, but suppliers should not be charging any shortfall entirely at the increased rate,' the spokesman added. 'If there has been an increase in prices in that period, the demand in the \"catch-up\" bill should include the old and new rates. A supplier should charge you the energy you used at the correct tariff at the existing time, not just on the higher rate.'</p> <p>Estimates for fuel bills plague residential customers and form 75 per cent of complaints to Energywatch. No industry body keeps a record of the proportion of customers paying either by estimate or actual reading, and suppliers are unwilling to provide such information.</p> <p>'Estimated bills are based on the supplier's view of how your energy will pattern out throughout the year based on previous records,' says Scott Byrom from price comparison service Moneysupermarket.com. 'If no records are available, the supplier may base this on average consumption.'</p> <p>The alternative is to provide a reading directly to the supplier, known as a 'self-read'. Although suppliers commit to accept the consumer's meter readings, this does not always work as well as it should, according to Energywatch, which receives a high volume of complaints from customers who say their readings were ignored by their supplier.</p> <p>The problem has prompted independent energy provider First:utility to launch a new service tomorrow to install a 'smart meter' in your home that would allow users to see how much electricity they are using. The meters also send a regularly updated accurate reading to the company, ensuring there is no mismatch between bills.</p> <p>However, the overall issue boils down to this: you either end up with debt on your energy account if you are not paying enough, or in credit if you are paying too much.</p> <p>Crucially, once the estimate has been generated, it's down to the customer to dispute this and provide the supplier with the correct reading; choose to do so and you can ask for the bill to be amended accordingly. If there is a discrepancy between the estimate and the actual reading, you will have to pay that amount if you have not paid enough, or if you've overpaid, the supplier will have to credit that amount to your next bill.</p> <p>This may sound relatively straightforward when prices are flat, but grows more complicated when you consider the number of price fluctuations we have been seeing in the energy market of late. Last month, Npower and Scottish Power rounded off a five-week provider onslaught when they announced their price hikes - of 26 and 34 per cent on gas respectively, and 14 per cent and 9 per cent on electricity. With these announcements, these suppliers became the last of the Big Six to put prices up twice this year. Overall, average prices have risen 38 per cent this year. </p> <p>But as well as the danger of a catch-up bill with estimates, there is also the cost of overpayment. 'By overpaying you are effectively giving your supplier an interest-free loan,' says the Energywatch spokesman. 'Once again, you should get a refund relative to the tariffs you have been on, so it may mean that two rates have to be calculated if there has been a price change.'</p> <p>While you can opt to have the surplus credited back to you, it is more usual for it to be carried over into next year's charges; either way, you will never get back any interest on overpayment. </p> <p>Overpayment is most likely to happen if you are paying by direct debit. Say the price of gas and electricity goes up; your supplier will review your account and increase your payment. Under the terms of the agreement your supplier must notify you, but they can take a while to adjust the new rate for their customers, so if you're on a direct debit this may go up higher than you expected because the supplier needs to catch up.</p> <p>Providers say they make every effort to get actual readings as often as possible. EDF Energy says that while the provider aims to read meters every two years, it also 'encourages its customers to give their meter readings through the \"Read, Reduce Reward Scheme\".'</p> <p>'This can help reduce bills, ensure customers receive accurate bills and be rewarded with 250 Nectar points for each read provided,' a spokesman says. A spokeswoman for Eon insists that the supplier would only bill for energy at the right rate. 'Energy used prior to a price increase would always be billed on the previous rate, regardless of when the customer pays,' she says. 'If this is based on an estimated reading, we would base the charge on the customer's average consumption, billing for the period prior to a price rise on the old rate, and after on the new rate.'</p> <p>A Npower spokesman adds that all suppliers use 'robust, sophisticated estimating routines based on previous consumption, average consumption for similar properties and the time of year in question. Any issues around matching consumption to price will be few and far between. But customers do need to realise they have a part to play by providing regular meter readings where possible.'</p> <p>The best way to proceed is by keeping a sharp eye on your usage and taking your own readings every time a quarterly bill comes in. Even if you get an annual statement, take readings once a month to keep track of what you are using so you can compare that with the statement when it arrives.</p> <p>'This helps to ensure you are paying only for the energy you use - and avoids you getting in debt with your supplier,' says Byrom.</p> <p>At the same time, sending in frequent meter readings, especially after a price change, will help to avoid overpaying.</p> <p>Finally, if you change energy supplier, you will be contacted by the new supplier to collect an actual reading.</p> <p>'This enables the new supplier to start your account accordingly,' says Byrom. 'The information is then passed on to the previous supplier who will use this to produce a final bill. But if you have not produced an actual reading before, you risk being charged a high bill if the estimates have not been sufficient to cover your usage.'</p> <p>Further, if you owe more than \u00a3100 to your current provider, you will not be able to switch until that debt is cleared- so it's worth taking actual readings to avoid this. </p> <h2>Caught out?</h2> <p>If you think that you are being asked to pay an unreasonable amount at the higher rate for a 'catch-up' bill - in the summer, say, even though you are likely to have used most of the extra units in the winter when prices were lower - you can request an investigation.</p> <p>'If you are concerned about what price the catch-up units have been allocated at, you can ask your supplier to investigate and they may reallocate the units used between the old and new tariff rates,' says an Energywatch spokesman.</p> <p>Nonetheless, if the customer is in debt to their provider, they will either have to pay back the amount in full or arrange for a payment plan to pay back the amount over a given period of time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For questions about your energy bills, contact <a href=\"http://www.energywatch.org.uk\">www.energywatch.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk\">www.direct.gov.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com\">www.uswitch.com</a>.

  "<p>Believe it or not, there is a small minority of ordinary Britons with no fear whatever of the credit crunch. The super-rich, of course, have the funds to tide them over, but there is a growing band of more modest consumers who can almost match them for confidence.</p> <p>While many people will drift into their overdraft more often than they would like or will pay credit card or utility bills a little late, some savers and spenders always stay one step ahead in the financial game. Never going into the red, rarely using a credit card, putting cash by each month for a rainy day, they are, quite simply, good with money.</p> <p>If there has been one positive outcome from the credit crunch, it has made people more aware of the value of money. According to Yorkshire Bank, 73 per cent of us say we are more careful with our money than we were 12 months ago, while 50 per cent say they are more likely to save for a big purchase than just slapping it on their credit card. </p> <p>Gary Lumby, head of retail banking at Yorkshire Bank, says: 'It seems people are finding that a more prudent approach to managing their finances brings greater rewards and satisfaction than the days of cheap credit and \"buy now, pay later\".'</p> <p>Price comparison site Moneynet.co.uk is launching a 'financial detox' programme later this year, which will aim to help people organise their money, sending them monthly 'money action plans'. </p> <p>Andrew Hagger of Moneynet says: 'A lot of people don't think they have the time to sort out their finances or that it's too tricky to get to grips with. But the key is to be organised, to know what's going in and out of your account when. Ideally, you need to get into the habit of banking online so that you can check your balance two or three times a week and transfer any excess into a savings account.'</p> <p>But is it possible to be that organised? According to Alison Fryett, a 39-year-old dispenser for Boots, it is. 'I have never been in debt,' she says. 'I always have a rough idea of how much is in my bank account at any time and I bank online so I can see exactly what is going where. I get my wages paid in, then all my direct debits for the house go out. Whatever's left goes into my savings account. I keep a little check on my husband's accounts too, as he's not so good with it.'</p> <p>Sarah James, who is in her forties, has never (that's right, never) been overdrawn. And on the rare occasions she uses her one credit card, she always clears it in full well before the interest kicks in. Until this year, she had never had a current account; her wages were paid into a building society savings account which she accessed with a cash card. 'I didn't want a current account, but my husband said we should have a joint one, so we do,' she says. 'But I just don't like that feeling that you could potentially spend what isn't actually there.'</p> <p>But Mrs James still likes to spend. She describes herself as a shopaholic - but only when she can afford to be. 'I was brought up with the understanding that you don't just go out and get something if you can't pay for it. I've had good spending habits ever since I was young.'</p> <p>When she goes shopping, Mrs James will pay with cash or put half on her credit card and pay the other half up front. She steers clear of finance purchase plans and takes advantage of reward points schemes for savings and treats (she bought free flights with some Nectar points).</p> <p>'If I've earned it, I'll spend it - but I won't spend what's not there,' she says. 'I would never get myself into debt on a credit card and I think that's the problem for many people - they buy things they can't afford or are living in houses they couldn't afford in the first place. It's easy to buy things on credit and that's why people think they can have everything they want. I wouldn't say I'm especially frugal - I love shopping for clothes and things for the house - but if I don't have the cash this month, I'll save up for it next month. You can wait for some things.'</p> <p>Both women say they learnt the value of money in their childhood. However, it can take a major setback, such as losing their job, to make other people realise it's time they sorted out their finances. Robert Parker, 42, from Forest Hill in south London, says he learnt to control his finances after being made redundant two years ago.</p> <p>'I gained a lot in terms of looking at my finances and learning how to manage,' he says. 'I realised that there was no point in having savings if I had a big mortgage, so I put all my savings towards it, leaving me with a small pot of savings for emergencies.' </p> <p>He now has a 'negligible mortgage' and saves between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400 a month: 'It's not that I'm tight with money; it's just my thinking behind it. I have a very clear idea of what I want to spend money on - travelling, music - but I'm also careful not to buy things I don't really want.'</p> <p>If you're lucky enough to have a small mortgage - or none at all - it is much easier to stay on top of things, says Hagger. 'If you don't have a mortgage you don't have the strain of a large amount being taken from your account each month. But if you have a mortgage and then have an unexpected bill - such as an emergency car repair - you're less likely to have a rainy-day fund to turn to.' </p> <p>Some say you should have an emergency fund equivalent to three months pay, but even this can be unrealistic. 'It's just important to have some savings you can get to instantly,' says Hagger. 'And if you use your credit card correctly, it can help your cash flow. It doesn't matter if you use it for an emergency and pay it off in instalments each month and get charged a little bit of interest on it. But it's a very different matter if you start using it to fund your day-to-day living and only make minimum payments - that's what you definitely shouldn't do.'</p>",
  "<p>I am walking through Manhattan on a hot Monday in August, when it first occurs to me that, at 36 and 5/6ths, I am far too old to be wearing hot pants in public. The hot pants (teal denim by American Apparel) had seemed absolutely fine when I'd popped them on that morning: acceptable, uncontroversial, bog-standard summer-in-the-city wear. But now, suddenly, with no preamble and for no good reason (no one had shouted the Yank equivalent of 'Oi! Raddled old slapper in the hot pants!' at me, or anything), they strike me as v risky. I feel unequivocally mutton.</p> <p>Officially, I do not accept received wisdom on ladies, age and clothes. I do not believe that the cut-off point for a high hemline (or a short sleeve or a tight frock) is 25; I believe that, as long as your body and your spirit hold up, then you should knock yourself out. It's all a question of confidence, no? And OMG how great did 63-year-old Helen Mirren look in a bikini and light tan on the beaches of Puglia this summer?</p> <p>And yet here I am, stranded on a sidewalk beneath a billboard advertising the opening of New York's inaugural Topshop, screamingly self-conscious, appalled by what I have only just recognised as large expanses of my extremely naked flesh, as shamed as a schoolgirl who's inadvertently tucked her skirt into her knickers en route to assembly; generally besieged by doubt.</p> <p>Who the hell do I think I am, anyway? Alexa frigging Chung? I hotfoot it back to my hotel to change, only to discover that I am now suspicious of every element of my wardrobe. If I've misjudged the hot pants, then what else? The treggings and shoe-boot combination? The T-shirt dress, the skinny jeans, the Ray-Ban Wayfarers? Are my feet too old for gladiator sandals? </p> <p>How long have I been deluded about my look? Months? Years? Or have I only just reached the tipping point on fashion? Have I entered the precise hour on the precise day of the precise year of my life when fashionable clothes stop making sense on me? Must I now renounce the whole deal and resort to monochrome investment pieces and understated timeless chic for ever and ever? How deep does this thing go?</p> <p>The debilitating phase of my fash crise only lasts another 15 minutes - as long as it takes me to climb into an excellent Vanessa Bruno day dress, and reassure myself that I probably won't get laughed out of cocktails at the Mandarin Oriental that evening. Even so, I am reeling from the hot-pant revelation. I bin the offending article; take a quiet moment to acknowledge that I've passed a milestone, sartorially speaking. And after all that, I am still left with a nagging suspicion: could I be too old for cool clothes?</p> <p>While I have never subscribed to the cult of youth - never suffered from ageorexia, or embraced diktats that mummies must be yummy, and grannies must shop at H&amp;M, never lied about my age, or coquettishly asked a bloke to guess it - I'm totally guilty of subscribing to the Cult of Cool. I watch The Mighty Boosh for clothing concepts as well as comedy, I check in with street fashion weblogs facehunter.blogspot.com and thesartorialist.com daily; and I am particularly addicted to American Apparel. </p> <p>Oh, that shop! Glorious, pick 'n' mix counter of the multicoloured jersey world, staffed by fun hipsters who prance around in outfits so insouciantly outr\u00e9, so high-waisted-leggings-over-a-racer-back-loose-fit-vest-top, that you feel entirely safe, relatively, with your own little sartorial experiments. I've been spending increasing amounts of money and time in American Apparel in the two years or so since it launched in the UK; and, since the beginning of this year, things have spiralled somewhat out of control.</p> <p>It began in earnest in January, when I found myself in the American Apparel on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles - and I decided that I could totally get away with the label's signature PVC-coated leggings, providing I wore them with tops that covered my arse. By February, American Apparel shiny stirrup tights were a central facet of my spring look - I'd picked up my first pair at the launch of the brand new Oxford Street branch. Cute! In May, I decided that the shop's Ala\u00efa-esque bodycon mini frocks (\u00a323 a pop, yay!) were entirely acceptable office wear - if I sharpened them up with a long-line boy-cut blazer. So by June, of course I'd snapped up a pair of American Apparel hot pants (along with a scoop-backed leotard and a gold lam\u00e9 bikini top, since you ask). And I'd enjoyed wearing them enormously - until the epiphany on Broadway. </p> <p>So now what? I am look-less and clueless and in danger of losing a substantial sense of my own identity. Where do I go from here? </p> <p>Apparently: Jaeger. And Russell &amp; Bromley. And the revamped Whistles. And Hobbs. According to my high-up, high-end fashion sources, these grande dames of the mid-market with their grown-up ladies' clothes are doing storming business with everyone, even the hipster classes, right now. Credit crunch be damned: monotone investment pieces and understated timeless classics are like, totally hot right now. Which might explain why I pre-ordered: a camel cashmere cape from Jaeger, and a one-shoulder cocktail dress from Whistles, and why I've owned and enjoyed a pair of R&amp;B's Chester loafers for almost an entire season now (I got them before Alexa Chung, actually). And which might also explain the grim Manhattan moment - a visceral, primal reaction to the dawning realisation that I was working a ruefully outmoded fashion concept. Apparently, as of, oh, right now or so, the coolest clothes are as middle-aged as I am, and hoorah for that! (Although - I still think I can totally get away with the PVC-coated leggings.)</p>",
  "<p>Dr Frederic Brandt has several claims to fame. He is, for instance, the largest user of injectable collagen and Botox - in the world. 'I just love fillers!' he tells me. And how. When we meet at his New York clinic he wastes no time in revealing that he regularly injects himself. </p> <p>'The last session I did was six-and-a-half vials!' His face is a smooth, jowl-free mask. Imagine a tub of frozen yoghurt, not a single line or wrinkle. He is cosmetic medicine's Peter Pan.</p> <p>In fact, in the 25 years since he began practising (Brandt set up shop in 1982 after completing both an oncology and dermatology residency at medical school in Philadelphia) he has personally tested every procedure and product he uses in his clinics - on himself.</p> <p>All of which has made the 59-year-old Brandt surreally young-looking, and very rich. He is the Baron of Botox, the King of Collagen. His clients pay up to $7,000 for a full face of injections and come to him from all over the world, some as often as six times a year. </p> <p>Now he's becoming increasingly well known as the doctor behind the 'New New Face'. He specialises in what's called the Y Lift, where filler is injected into the area just below the cheekbones. Ten years ago women wanted their cheeks and foreheads to be pulled, stretched and tightened, like vacuum-packed pieces of steak. These days they arrive in his consulting rooms demanding something more youthful and plush. Think of a plumped-up cushion. Out with pinched, in with peachy. There's a new face around - and it's a baby's.</p> <p>Jonathan Van Meter, a writer at New York magazine and US Vogue, blames fashion and celebrity glossies filled with images of teenagers for the New New aesthetic. 'Their faces are plump and dewy and flushed with youth. As thin as their bodies are, they still haven't entirely shed the baby fat on their faces. This is what women in their forties and fifties are now after: baby fat.'</p> <p>The idea that New York women want to make their faces fatter seems counter-intuitive when they're in a desperate battle to get the rest of their bodies, from the neck downwards, down to a Hot-Box-yoga-honed, 800-calories-a-day size zero, but the current theory is that what they need to keep their faces looking young is volume. </p> <p>Someone like Cher, according to Van Meter, is the essence of the old way of doing things: tight skin, trout pout, skinny nose. On the other hand, Demi Moore epitomises the New New Face - youthful skin, defined cheekbones and chin, heart-shaped face. Industry insiders report that in MST (Movie Star Time) clients want to look the way they did four films ago - or about eight years in RPT (Regular People Time). As Van Meter quips: 'The New New Face is really your old face.'</p> <p>They may say their dewy glow is all down to healthy eating and exercise, but increasingly it's more likely due to a new regime of fillers and injectables. In the US, there has been a 754 per cent increase in the number of non-surgical procedures since 1997 compared to a 114 per cent rise in surgery. Dermatologists are the new glamour doctors and Dr Brandt is one of the biggest players, with two clinics - one on East 34th Street in Manhattan, the other in Miami; two best-selling books including Ten Minutes/Ten Years: Your Definitive Guide to a Beautiful and Youthful Appearance, and a successful anti-ageing skincare range that is sold in 40 countries. </p> <p>We meet at the beginning of a typical working day - 27 clients, 10 hours, seven consulting rooms. Brandt, who gets up at 6.30am, has already done an hour and a half of Ashtanga yoga. Hanging on the wall just outside his office is a giant framed photograph by the fashion photographer Steven Klein. (Brandt is a fan of contemporary art. His collection includes Richard Prince, Damien Hirst, Gilbert &amp; George.) In the foreground, a toned, tanned, naked man lies by a pool while lurking in the background is Dr Brandt himself, wielding aloft a giant needle. </p> <p>'What can we do for you today?' Dr Brandt asks a New York society hostess, who has homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. She is, I estimate, about 50, dressed in a navy ensemble of Chanel cardigan, capri pants and ballet flats, and a diamond ring the size of a golf ball.</p> <p>'I'm a mess,' she mumbles out of the side of her mouth, which she can barely move due to the anaesthetic cream smeared all over her face. </p> <p>'I've been under such stress.' Her skin - or what I can see of it beneath all the gloop - looks great to me, much better than mine, but she is adamant that she looks awful: 'Make me look younger! Lift me up! I have to be in a photo shoot on Wednesday.' </p> <p>Brandt starts on her cheeks with Perlane, a favourite filler of his because it gives volume to the mid-face and jaw (it is a hyaluronic acid, made from the by-products of the fermentation of strep bacteria). 'It's all about having those convex surfaces to reflect light,' he trills. </p> <p>Each time the Perlane is squirted into the apple of the cheek the tissue puffs up a little and a bright spot of blood oozes out. This is dashed away with a wad of surgical tissue. Squirt. Puff. Squirt. Puff. Chanel lady's cheeks inflate like a bicycle tyre. </p> <p>'Oooh, that looks fabulous,' Brandt says, admiring his handiwork. 'Am I right?' Yes, yes, I say. She does look fabulous, in a slightly disconcerting way - the image of a Hitchcock blonde with bruised cheeks. </p> <p>Brandt's assistant, dressed in the staff uniform of black scrubs, passes another hypodermic needle, and Brandt injects amounts into the fine lines under the eye. Zap - a line disappears. Zap. There goes another. Now the Cosmoderm comes out, a collagen used to combat the very fine feather lines that form in the naso-labial area of the face. On and on it goes.</p> <p>'How about the lips?' he inquires.</p> <p>'I'm so afraid of looking puffy,' she says.</p> <p>'OK, just a little then.' Brandt squirts Juvederm around the lips just above the vermilion border.</p> <p>'I don't tell anyone, not even my daughter,' the grande dame reveals, shooting me a look as she clasps a Latex glove containing frozen peas to her bruised cheeks. 'My fianc\u00e9, who is 16 years younger than me, said, \"You wouldn't put that stuff in your face, would you?\"' She denied it. 'I don't mind getting older....' She tells me. 'As long as I don't look it.' </p> <p>Now it is time for the big guns: Botulinum toxin, better known as Botox, one of the most powerful nerve poisons known to man. Brandt uses so much of it he calls it Bo for short. </p> <p>'Frown, relax, frown, relax,' he instructs, injecting between her eyebrows and then along the imperceptible furrows of her forehead. There's a pause as he reloads with more ammunition. </p> <p>'What happened to Jocelyn?' asks the grande dame in a regretful tone of voice, referring to the ex-wife of the art dealer Alec Wildenstein whose face was made so unrecognisable by surgery that she is now known as 'the Bride of Wildenstein'. 'She's so intelligent. Why did she do that to herself? She was so beautiful.'</p> <p>'People don't see themselves,' Brandt sighs, without irony, jabbing more Botox into the taut muscles of her neck and grimacing as he pulls out the needle. 'It's the same as anorexics. They don't see themselves.' </p> <p>Chanel lady concurs. 'They become obsessed.' Later, I discover she is, incredibly, 70. </p> <p><strong>In a break between clients Brandt snacks on </strong>spinach and beans. His father owned a sweet shop in Newark, New Jersey, and died early from juvenile diabetes at the age of 47. His son, too, used to have 'the worst sweet tooth' until as an adult he decided to wean himself off sugar by embarking on a programme which has been so successful he has never come off it. It is a diet completely devoid of sugar, wheat in any form, any grains with gluten, yeast, juice, dairy, root vegetables, and most fruit, and he recommends you try it.</p> <p>He's wearing a grey and black Prince of Wales check jacket, nipped in at the waist; white Dolce &amp; Gabbana shirt covered in zips; olive green designer camouflage pants; blinding metallic Gucci sneakers; and purple Alain Mikli glasses that offset his blond hair. It's an outr\u00e9 get-up that chimes with his uncannily youthful complexion. </p> <p>When, I ask, did he first start using Botox on his clients? 'In the early Nineties.'</p> <p>How often should clients see you? 'Injectables are recommended every four to five months.'</p> <p>How young is the youngest person he has seen? 'Probably early twenties,' he says. 'I think in the mid-thirties most people start showing their age.' </p> <p>How about reports of the dangers of Botox? 'Perfectly safe.' </p> <p>At what point does he think having cosmetic procedures can go too far? 'When it's your only focus. When it becomes not a part of your life but your entire life. Instead of enhancing your life, it takes over your life. Ready to go?' </p> <p>Brandt is off again, skipping like a mountain goat. </p> <p>The next client is a chic, fine-boned wife and grandmother who divides her time between a house in Palm Beach and an apartment in New York. She has been a Brandt client for two years. </p> <p>'I'm seeing the ex-husband on Saturday, so we don't want bruising,' she teases Brandt, smiling through the anaesthetic. (This can be a teeth-grittingly painful procedure. Bruising can last anywhere between two days and two weeks.) Dressed in black skinny jeans, Chanel cardigan, white sneakers, her YSL bag on a nearby chair, she looks the picture of a youthful fiftysomething. She tells me she is 65. I nearly fall over. </p> <p>Brandt begins by injecting Perlane into her cheeks. 'This is what we're using to add volume and it pulls the whole face up. You can see that, right? It gives volume to the jaw.' </p> <p>I ask her how often she sees Dr Brandt. 'I come more often than most because I'm a little more vain,' she says. 'I've had plastic surgery. With surgery the ageing process still continues. I think this keeps you looking like you did when you first had plastic surgery, kind of fresh. It's a perfect way to maintain your appearance. It's so natural-looking.' </p> <p>'Your lips are holding up great,' Brandt says as he reaches for the Cosmoderm. </p> <p>Do the needles hurt? I wonder. 'My husband always asks that,' she replies. 'I tell him, \"However much it hurts - it's worth it\".' Why did she start? 'You think you look fine, and then one day your hair is white, and you have a cold and you're wearing no make-up, and you walk into the bakery and they ask you if you have ARP [the US equivalent of qualifying as an OAP].'</p> <p>According to Brandt, what we notice when people age is the fact that their cheeks start dripping down, and they begin to lose volume in the upper face which causes sagging in the lower face. We lose, he says, our 'youthful convexities'. What he means is that instead of having beautiful even uninterrupted cheeks, our faces end up as a series of hills and valleys. 'A facelift is good for tightening but it doesn't do anything for volume loss.' Which is where the New New face comes in.</p> <p>Next door a pretty thirtysomething New York career girl is waiting for Brandt in a state of panic because her skin has been frozen by Botox, the result of visiting another dermatologist.</p> <p>'I can't feel my eyebrows,' she wails. Her forehead is completely unlined, like a block of ice. 'I can't inject anything to take it away,' Brandt says sadly. 'But eventually the movement will come back.' He lifts her brows slightly with a couple of judiciously placed Botox injections and tells her to be patient. </p> <p>Next we see a 50-year-old New Yorker, who has had a full face and neck of injections from Brandt and looks completely overdone, her lips verging on the trout pout. 'I always tell him, \"Do it more!\" she says. 'But that's just my personality.' </p> <p>And after her we see a 26-year-old brunette from Miami who in my opinion shouldn't have been let within 10 miles of a cosmetic dermatologist's office. Tanned and eager, she holds a hand mirror two inches from her nose throughout the 10-minute session. </p> <p>'Ooh, I've never had that before!' she exclaims as Brandt uses filler on her jawline. 'Awesome. I'll get hooked. Ooh, you're so good.' </p> <p>Wasn't she too young? I asked Brandt afterwards. 'She had some fine lines around her lips,' he shrugs.</p> <p>Later we enter the room of a woman who is one of Brandt's most devoted clients. A very attractive 49-year-old wife and mother, she flies from Switzerland to New York six times a year to see him. </p> <p>'Two-and-a-half years I'm coming,' she says, eyes shining. 'She's got a lot of air miles,' Dr Brandt says, smiling. He's using an Aluma laser on her d\u00e9colletage, a non-burning laser that sucks up the skin and makes it contract, which stimulates the production of more collagen. </p> <p>'Ooh, look at that!' he says, hoovering her skin. 'I'm going to throw you off that chair and put myself on.' </p> <p>I ask her why she first decided to have cosmetic procedures. 'It's just a thing in your life,' she says, with some drama. 'You reach a certain age. It's not that we're just stupid chickens with too much money who want to look 20 or 30 years old again. It's not that your husband or your boyfriend or whatever is losing interest. There's just a point, it comes for every woman, when you reach a certain age, and the skin looks wrinkly and suddenly you're miserable. For beautiful women, this is hard.' </p> <p>She pauses for a minute. 'My mother, somehow she looked like she gave up on her life. She just did needlework and made tea. Suddenly she was closed and stopped socialising. I think surgery is a big risk, so I had to decide [whether or not to get fillers]. I would never change my doctor now.'</p> <p>She beams at Brandt. 'He listens to you. This makes you feel so good. You know, I have two children. My son and his friend were over and his friend said, \"You have a very young mother\". I felt wonderful!' </p> <p>How Dr Brandt's clients love him. As he races, sneakers flashing, between his brightly lit examining rooms you can almost feel the place throbbing with desire. You begin to see why people call this the female yuppie heroin. Every woman I see leaves his office with a beatific smile on her face, as if she was in the throes of a grand passion. It may be calamitous on the bank balance, but is it so morally reprehensible? I begin to wonder if just a little judiciously placed Botox might not be a good idea, after all.</p> <p>Between clients, I ask Dr Brandt for an assessment of my own 40-year-old skin. How would I get the New New face? 'I think you need to take care of your skin,' he says, 'make it more radiant. I think you need some volume in your cheeks,' he continues. 'And under your eyes and around your eyes.' He thinks for a minute. 'And then we could do some Botox around your eyes and your forehead... And fill in your cheeks where they're getting hollow. Those can be filled in with collagen.' He thinks again. 'And then we could do some laser treatment.' </p> <p>To say I was despondent is an understatement. </p> <p>It's 6.30pm. Among Brandt's last patients of the day are a husband and wife who sit swathed in white blankets with white anaesthetic on their faces, a slightly nervous air about them. A handsome couple, they are both successful - she is a colourist at a leading New York salon; he owns a furniture shop in SoHo. </p> <p>'How long have you two been married?' Brandt asks, skipping about the room. </p> <p>'Nineteen years,' the husband says.</p> <p>'Where do you get your energy from?' he asks Brandt, who is now singing 'Younger than Springtime'.</p> <p>'Not really from my mom or dad. But I was always a little different in my family. Everyone was quiet and reserved and there I was, putting on those Broadway plays in the living room!'</p> <p>More syringes come out for the wife, who is now wincing a little from the pain. I mention that I had witnessed one client that day, a yoga fanatic, whose pain threshold was so high she didn't have any anaesthetic cream.</p> <p>'Wow, no anaesthetic?' they both say, horrified.</p> <p>'When I inject myself I never numb,' Brandt chimes in. The last session I was six-and-a-half vials! I think I'd better stop!' Brandt is hitting his stride now. 'I always say, it's lucky I work here or I'd need to go on a payment plan!'</p> <p>The husband climbs up on the chair. 'You look like a schoolboy now!' says Brandt, syringes flying. 'You know,' he adds, 'I always say, this is the only doctor's office where if you can't move, you're happy.' </p> <h2>The New Ideal Face</h2> <p><strong>Madonna, 50, Elizabeth Hurley, 43, Demi Moore, 45, all have the perfect face</strong></p> <p><strong>Forehead </strong>is smooth and wrinkle-free (can be achieved by Botox injections).</p> <p><strong>Eyes</strong> look wide with no deep lines (this look can be achieved by injecting filler under the lower lids).</p> <p><strong>Nose</strong> is straight (an upturned tip, the sign of a nose job, is no longer in vogue).</p> <p><strong>Lips</strong> are full and turn up slightly at sides (puffy 'trout pouts' are out).</p> <p><strong>Cheeks</strong> are plump (filler can be injected just below the cheekbones to create a fuller, young shape).</p> <p>There is no suggestion that the women mentioned above have had cosmetic work.</p>",
  "<p>Your Sunday roast stands accused. According to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink\">United Nation's chief climate expert, Rajendra Pachauri</a>, that tasty piece of top rump resting on your dining table is the source of many of the world's environmental woes, in particular those involved in the dangerous warming of the planet's climate. </p> <p>Our appetite for animal flesh is boosting fertiliser production, pollution and emission of greenhouse gases to dangerous levels, Pachauri has told The Observer. Give up meat - at least for one day a week - and we can help to save the Earth, he added.</p> <p>Nor is Pachauri, the chairman of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, alone in his complaints. A host of campaigners have united to condemn meat-eaters for bringing environmental mayhem to the world. 'The human appetite for animal flesh is a driving force behind virtually every major category of environmental damage now threatening the human future: deforestation, erosion, fresh water scarcity, air and water pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, social injustice, the destabilisation of communities and the spread of disease,' the Worldwatch Institute has warned.</p> <p>These are harsh charges to bring against those of us who love our leg of lamb or the odd fillet for our dinner. And not surprisingly, the meat industry has robustly rejected the accusations. Chris Lamb, head of marketing for the pig industry group BPEX, said meat producers were being unfairly targeted while some environmentalists' proposals for cutting emissions were actually harmful. For example, keeping livestock indoors would cut carbon dioxide but damage animal welfare, he said. 'Climate change is a very young science and our view is there are a lot of very simplistic solutions being proposed.' Nevertheless, it is clear that meat-eating has been forced on to the defensive in recent months, a point highlighted by Raj Patel, author of Stuffed and Served (Portobello Books) in a recent article in Observer Food Monthly (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/22/foodanddrink.food\">Is meat off the menu?</a>, June 22) . He believes growing food for animals is a waste of resources in an overcrowded world.</p> <p>'The average meat eater in the US produces about 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide more than a vegetarian every year. That's because animals are hungry and the grain they eat takes energy, usually fossil fuels, to produce,' he says.</p> <p>The world's fertiliser industry uses natural gas as a basic ingredient and therefore contributes to global warming when it uses fossil fuel to manufacture the extra fertilisers needed to ensure cattle and other animals have sufficient food. For example, it requires 2.2 calories of fossil-fuel energy to produce a single calorie of plant protein, according to researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In turn, it takes even more plant protein to make animal protein. It requires four calories of plant protein to make one of chicken protein, while the ratio for pork is 17:1; for lamb, 50:1; and for beef, a staggering 54:1. 'That is a lot of energy and a lot of grain diverted,' adds Patel.</p> <p>In fact, it is a massive amount of energy, the journal Physics World has noted. 'The animals we eat emit 21 per cent of all the carbon dioxide that can be attributed to human activity,' it states.</p> <p>Geophysicists Gidon Eshel and Pamela Martin from the University of Chicago have even calculated that changing eating habits to become a vegetarian does more to fight global warming than switching from a gas-guzzling SUV to a fuel-efficient hybrid car, such is the amount of Co2 generated in the production of beef, pork or lamb. </p> <p>Nor is carbon dioxide the only issue. Apart from turning grain into flesh, livestock also transforms it into methane, as flatulence. And that has especially serious consequences, as the World Watch Institute stressed in 2004 in its report 'State of the World'. 'Belching, flatulent livestock emit 16 percent of the world's annual production of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas,' it noted. </p> <p>According to scientists' calculations, methane has a global warming potential that is 23 times that of carbon dioxide. This means that a gram of methane - produced from a cow's rear-end - warms the planet's atmosphere 23 times as much as a gram of CO2 produced, say, from a car engine. Thus the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has concluded that nearly a fifth of all greenhouse-gas emissions come from livestock, more than from all forms of transport.</p> <p>On top of these ecological headaches, there is the issue of rainforest clearance. Despite all efforts to halt their destruction, rainforests are still being cut down at an alarming rate. Every year, 32 million acres - an area the size of England - is destroyed or degraded. Some of this land is used to provide pasture for cows. Other areas are given over to fields for the growing of soya beans which are then used to feed cows. </p> <p>Apart from the increased amounts of methane and carbon dioxide that are produced by this type of farming, the world loses out though loss of wildlife - 90 percent of all species on Earth live in rainforests - as well as through the destruction of trees which filter our air, emit oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. Rainforests are the lungs of the Earth but we are choking them through our appetite for meat, say environmentalists.</p> <p>Nor are there any signs of improvement. In 2006, farmers produced an estimated 276 million tonnes of chicken, pork, beef and other meat: four times as much as they did in 1961, according to the Worldwatch Institute. On average, each person on the planet now eats about 43kg of animal flesh. Nor is this trend getting any better. It is estimated that meat production is destined to double from its present level by the middle of the century.</p> <p>Hence, Pachauri's urging of the world to give up meat for at least one day a week. 'In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about reductions in a short period of time, it clearly is the most attractive opportunity,' said Pachauri, an Indian economist and a vegetarian. 'Give up meat for one day [a week] initially, and decrease it from there,' he added.</p> <p>It is a fairly forceful conclusion and it has triggered an equally robust response from those who belief the lifestyle of a carnivore is perfectly acceptable, both morally and environmentally. In a counterblast to Raj Patel's Observer Food Monthly article, the distinguished food writer Joanna Blythman said that universal prescriptions for solving the world's food crisis should be treated with suspicion. 'Try telling the Masai tribesmen who have reared livestock for millennia that they should plough up scrubby Kenyan savannah and plant millet,' she argued.</p> <p>As to 'wet, green Britain', it lends itself to livestock production. 'Huge upland swathes of the country are quite incapable of growing food crops, but this otherwise useless land can be grazed by cattle, sheep, goats, deer and other game,' Blythman added.</p> <p>Certainly, in Britain, the idea that meat production is a recipe for widespread environmental destruction is not as easy to sustain as it is in other parts of the world, such as the Brazilian rainforest. As UK farmers point out, grazing animals on uplands keeps heather and grasses under control and help some of our rarest birds to survive, in particular ground-nesting birds such as the lapwing, curlew, golden plover, snipe and red grouse. And in turn, these birds provide for food for UK raptors, including the red kite and golden eagle. Take away our sheep and cows and the environmental impact could be disastrous. As a recent RSPB report stated: 'Grazing animals form an important component of the uplands.'</p> <p>Nor are birds the only concern. Heather left untamed grows out of control - stringy and lanky - and strangles the growth of other plant species. Without sheep and cattle to graze on them, heather landscapes would eventually become barren and would start to pose fire risks. Crucially, this latter problem strikes at the very heart of the relationship between farming in Britain and the issue of global warming. </p> <p>Our peatlands, which cover much of our upland regions, are massive stores of carbon dioxide. In England and Wales, they could absorb up to 41,000 tonnes of CO2 a year if they were in pristine condition. But if damaged by burning, as well as by too much draining of water and by overgrazing, as has occurred in the past, they could release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide. </p> <p>So protecting peat has become a major ecological priority for Britain, and authorities now recognise the important role that hill farmers who rear cattle and sheep play in maintaining this vital habitat.</p> <p>As to the rest of British farmland, which sits on lower ground and richer soil, there is some room for change though the benefits are obvious. </p> <p>'It is true that Britain also has extensive areas of semi-natural grassland with richer soil, currently used for livestock that could, theoretically, be drained and ploughed to grow fruit, vegetable and cereals,' says Blythman. </p> <p>'But in that process, all the carbon that is currently taken out of the atmosphere and stored in grass pasture would be released into the environment.'</p> <p>The issue of meat-eating and global warming is far from clear cut, in other words. Turning to a vegetarian diet to save the planet might produce significant cuts in carbon production in many parts of the world but it could also have damaging consequences for others, including Britain. The UK has a long, established tradition in lifestock production and its agriculture is geared to those ends. So yes, cut back on your week's intake of ham and chicken as Pachauri suggests but individuals should not feel pressured into adopting a lifestyle that is completely vegetarian in order to help to halt global warming. </p> <p>As Blythman says: 'A no-meat diet? That sounds like ideology triumphing over common sense, time-honoured custom and appetite.'</p>",
  "<p>Not so long ago, Britain and the rest of Europe were rejoicing in America's presidential choice of Barack Obama versus John McCain. The hated George W Bush would be gone and a sensible, smart leader would inhabit the White House again - whoever won. The Economist put McCain and Obama on its cover and declared, 'This is the most impressive choice America has had for a very long time.' Praise the Lord.</p> <p>Then along came Sarah Palin, the lightly travelled Christian evangelical McCain chose as his running mate. Much has been made of the soap-operatic side of the governor of Alaska: the caribou-hunting, mooseburger-eating mother-of-five who drives herself to work, her beauty queen past, her pregnant, unwed 17-year-old daughter. What really matters is what she believes in and why McCain selected her. On both counts, much of the world outside America will not be pleased.</p> <p>Palin describes herself and her family as 'typical'. But to most of the planet, she's an exotic. She's a fundamentalist Christian. She advocated teaching creationism alongside evolution in Alaska's schools. Her right-to-life convictions extend to stem cell research, which she opposes. </p> <p>She's opposed to gay marriage. She's about as right as a Republican can get. She does not believe human behaviour is responsible for global warming. She supports home schooling and other alternatives to traditional state education. She's anti-gun control; for example, she supports ending the ban on handguns that has existed in Washington DC for more than three decades.</p> <p>Palin has said she would not force her views on others. Indeed, she kept a campaign pledge not to push as governor for mandatory inclusion of creationism in her state's school curriculum. But she cannot pretend always to divorce her personal views from matters of state and governance. In praying that a natural gas pipeline would be built in Alaska, she used traditional evangelical language. She believes the US mission in Iraq is a 'task that is from God'.</p> <p>The McCain who chose Palin is not the McCain familiar to many of us outside the US. The McCain we know is a worldly, well-informed, straight-talking Republican who's a likeable fixture at policy talking shops in London and Berlin, a man at ease with men and women of international affairs across the world. His views do not always coincide with his chums in world capitals - eg, his hawkishness on Iraq - but he's long been seen as a safe and pragmatic pair of hands on big issues like trade (he's a free trader, more so than Obama) and the environment (unlike Palin, he accepts that human behaviour is a contributor to climate change).</p> <p>The McCain who chose Palin is someone who found himself in a political panic. In the weeks before the Democratic national convention, the polls put Obama and McCain head to head. Predictably, Obama got a boost after the Democratic lovefest in Denver. But even discounting that, at a time of widespread disaffection with Bush and the Republican party more generally, the inertia of public opinion heading into an election seemed to favour Obama. The natural inclination of many of McCai n's advisers was to turn to the base, the far right wing of the party, much of it evangelical, whose money, hard work and get-out-the-vote fervour could make a big difference on 4 November.</p> <p>Under other circumstances, McCain might have gone for somebody more like himself - Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a pro-Iraq war Democrat-turned-independent, or former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, chosen by Bush to be the first director of the Office of Homeland Security after 9/11. But Lieberman, who is Jewish, and Ridge, a Catholic, are supporters of abortion rights. McCain occupies a kind of middle ground: he's in favour of overturning Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court decision upholding a woman's right to abortion, but he's against prosecuting women who have abortions. If how to appeal to the base was the question, neither Lieberman nor Ridge was the answer.</p> <p>Palin was. Her inexperience is easily ridiculed, especially when Cindy McCain, John's wife, comes along and tries to portray Palin as a keen Kremlinologist ('Remember: Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia. So, it's not as if she doesn't understand what's at stake.') Palin's message to the world is much like the one she delivered last Wednesday to her detractors in America: 'Here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country.'</p> <p>The message of her candidacy, the message of McCain's choice, is equally plain. America's religious right is back. In fact, despite all the wishful thinking riding on the departure of Bush, the religious right never really went away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stryker McGuire is a contributing editor of 'Newsweek' and editor of 'International Quarterly'.</p>",
  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>My partner and I want to visit the Lofoten Islands off northern Norway, but quotes for our 10-day trip have been beyond our budget of \u00a3800-1,000 each. Could you suggest a good alternative that will offer coastline, walking, contemporary self-catering accommodation and, most importantly, peace and quiet. We are hoping to travel in the first week of October.<br><strong>Kerry Turner, by email</strong></p> <p>You could still make it to the Lofotens on your budget. Though Norway is undoubtedly expensive, there are some good-value air links, especially out of season. Norwegian (<a href=\"http://www.norwegian.no\">norwegian.no</a>) flies from Edinburgh to Bodo with return fares from \u00a3200. From there, you can hop on a ferry to Svolv\u00e6r, the most southerly of the islands, and perfect for killer whale-watching trips. There's plenty of self-catering available. Try Svinoya (<a href=\"http://www.svinoya.no\">svinoya.no</a>), which has one-bed cabins from \u00a390 per night. The islands are an inclement place to visit outside summer - in October you can expect temperatures of around 5C. Come equipped for wind and rain. Closer to home, the Hebrides have a similarly dramatic coastline and unspoilt feel. Flights from Inverness to Stornaway cost from \u00a342.50 each way. For accommodation check out <a href=\"http://www.visithebrides.com\">visithebrides.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I am going to Central America in early January, for more than two months. The trip is organised through Frontier, and the cost is already quite expensive without flights. It starts in Mexico City, so I need to fly there, and finishes in Costa Rica. In order to keep the cost down I want to book a return flight to Mexico City, but this means when we finish in Costa Rica in mid-March I need to somehow get back to Mexico City in time for my return flight. Flights seem quite expensive, and a bit unreliable, but the only other option I can think of is travelling by bus. Is this the only way?<br><strong>Alice Priestley, Horsham, West Sussex</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Options are now limited to bus or flying. Although Paul Theroux rode the rails through much of Latin America for his 1979 classic The Old Patagonian Express, not much remains of the services he took. Intercity services in Mexico and Guatemala were suspended in the late 1990s and services in El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica are very limited or nonexistent, though freight services operate in some countries.</p> <p>As it sounds like time is tight, I would make two suggestions. First, if you haven't booked your ticket yet you should be able to arrange an open-jaw route from London, into Mexico City and out of San Jos\u00e9 at little more than the cost of a regular return. Second, Taca or Mexicana fly daily from San Jos\u00e9 to Mexico City. Fares for the three-hour flight will be around \u00a3250. Buy your ticket when you get to Costa Rica. Frontier may also have some suggestions as there must be a few of you in the same position.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My husband and I would like to take a cruise for our wedding anniversary, either to South America or the Arctic, but we are worried about the environmental issues. I read something recently that said cruising was worse for the planet than flying. Is this true? And are there any cruise lines that can truly be called 'green'? We would love to see a wilderness area.<br><strong>Lucy Metcalfe, Canterbury, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> It is true that cruising - at least on the mega-ships - does have serious environmental question marks. The biggest ships are rather like floating cities, which means they generate a similar amount of waste, all of which has to go somewhere. Until recently, this was often simply emptied into the sea, but most of the cruise lines have upped their green credentials recently, with rubbish compactors and water recycling plants on board. The best answer is to opt for a smaller ship; there are several companies that operate ships with a capacity of around 150 people. You can often reach more secluded areas and the atmosphere on board is much more personal. </p> <p>If you want to see Ecuador and the Galapagos, or the Arctic, Lindblad Expeditions (00 1 212 765 7740; <a href=\"http://www.expeditions.com\">expeditions.com</a>) operates in conjunction with National Geographic, and is committed to ensuring tourism and conservation can co-exist. Ships take no more than 100 people, and the company has raised more than \u00a32.5m for conservation projects. Other ethical cruising companies are Cruise West (00 1 888 8518133; <a href=\"http://www.cruisewest.com\">cruisewest.com</a>) and Sanctuary Cruising (<a href=\"http://www.sanctuarycruising.com\">sanctuarycruising.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I read that XL Airlines has cancelled all flights to the Caribbean, citing high fuel costs. I have flights booked with XL next month and am worried, after the recent collapse of the budget airline Zoom, that XL may go under too. If it does, will I receive compensation? And are there any arrangements between airlines so that stranded - or pre-booked - passengers can transfer onto other flights?<br><strong>James Kay, Monmouth, Wales</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you book a flight directly with an airline, and that company goes bust then there is almost no chance that you will receive compensation from the airline. Occasionally other airlines will offer reduced fares to help people return home, but this is not the case with outbound flights from the UK. If you booked the flight with a credit card, the credit card company should refund you the money if the airline goes out of business. The other option is airline failure insurance, most travel agents will offer this, or talk to your own insurer. If, however, your flight is part of a package then you have nothing to worry about; all tour operator packages are Atol-protected, and if the airline fails then the tour operator you have booked with is legally required to make alternative arrangements for you. </p> <h2>Feedback</h2> <p>In response to Mrs Walker's Argentina question (Letters, last week), my friend and I were in Argentina last February and we managed to do some short hikes in the Salta area. We booked ours through Norte Trekking (which I think we found in our Lonely Planet guide). Frederico does a variety of hikes for all abilities and different durations around Chile and Argentina. He was a fantastic guide and also spoke fluent English which was a great help as our Spanish was limited at that point.

  "<p>Excitement, amusement and entertainment are not the first words one would associate with Estonia. Yet, for a country with a population of scarcely more than a million, the small state has taken to gambling in an extraordinary fashion.</p> <p>The former Soviet nation boasts 139 casinos and was one of the first to embrace the industry following post-Communist deregulation after Estonian independence in 1991. Last year Bluff Europe, the European poker magazine, heralded the Estonian capital, Tallinn, as one of the top three cities in Europe for the game.</p> <p>Estonia has been a beacon for the Eastern European economies. It pioneered the 'flat tax' - among the lowest in Europe - a model followed by eight other states, including Russia. So radically right-wing were the changes that observers said the then Estonian Prime Minister made Margaret Thatcher look like a socialist.</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that the casino industry, like many others, has grown exponentially. At least 18 gaming companies have piled in, making it a European Las Vegas. The Olympic Entertainment Group, which is partly owned by HSBC, has an estimated 45 per cent share of the Estonian market, showing how enthusiastically the locals have taken to the new gambling establishments.</p> <p>Success has made Armin Karu, the owner of OEG in Estonia, one of the country's richest men. In 2005, OEG had 16 casinos compared with 38 in neighbouring Latvia, yet still surpassed it in terms of revenue by 78 per cent. By 2007, demand was such that 35 casinos had been built and operations in Estonia accounted for more than a third - \u20ac55.3m (\u00a344m) - of OEG's revenues, despite it expanding into countries such as Belarus, Ukraine, Poland and Romania.</p> <p>However, regulation has been virtually absent. So keen was the government to attract companies to its shores after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the authorities handed out casino licences without considering the consequences. Andres Kaljo, entertainments sector analyst at Tallinn-based Evli Securities, said that until recently 'anyone could open a small casino in Estonia'.</p> <p>The adult population has paid a heavy price. Between 2004 and 2006, the government conducted a survey and found that around 6 per cent of Estonian adults are gambling addicts and 80 per cent have tried some form of gambling, including state lotteries. The number considered gambling-dependent has increased by 30 per cent in the past two years.</p> <p>The government's hand has now been forced, somewhat belatedly, into developing a strategy for dealing with the problems unregulated gambling has created. It is bringing in a law next year to restrict the number of casinos - though it is increasing the concentrations of machines and tables. </p> <p>So Estonia is likely to continue as a 'stag-do destination'. But, with the country entering a sharp economic slowdown, it should remember that stag-dos are usually followed by bad hangovers.</p>",
  "<p>Dear David and Victoria (copies to: Brad and Angelina, Johnny Depp et al). Congratulations on your new purchase. You are in distinguished company. Enclosed are instructions that will not guarantee that your vineyard will give you a lifetime of happiness, but they may prevent you from turning your big fortune into a small one. NB: these guidelines will not teach you how to become grape growers and winemakers. For that you must turn to General Viticulture by AJ Winkler et al (University of California Press). You can skip the chapters on vine physiology and the control of viral vine disease through thermal therapy - but long before you get a tattoo of your wine label etched on to your arm, get to know your Winkler.</p> <p>Because, despite the seductive word \"oenology\", despite the power of wine to awaken memories of candlelit evenings, to enhance passion and console despair, wine is at heart an agricultural product, achieved by careful farming. And, like barley, onions and leeks, to keep growing the crops, you have to sell the crop. Here is the eternal winemaker's truth: to make wine, you have to sell wine.</p> <p>That sobering thought leads me to the next truth: to sell wine, it has to be good. Good and consistent. That requires careful viticulture and the best winemaker you can find. Much will depend on the terroir. For years new world winemakers rejected the notion of terroir with their revolutionary rallying cry \"soil is dirt\". They believed it perpetuated the belief that good wine was in the lap of the gods. But that's over. Now the mantra is: good wine is made in the winery; great wine is made in the vineyard. Before you sign the cheque, taste the dirt.</p> <p>Finally, even with all the professional help money can buy, vineyards need attention from the owner. It's the old saying: the best fertiliser is the owner's footprint. In fact, vines don't need fertiliser, they thrive in crummy soil. What they need is the owner's secateurs. Even if you do it only one day a year, learn how to prune your vines. Pruning is the foundation for all that a grape grower does for the rest of the year. Every act builds on what is left on the mature vine after pruning.</p> <p>Then watch your money disappear. For a long time you won't notice. You will be having too much fun designing labels and sharing bottles with your friends who will be amazed. You will laugh as you tell them your new French oak barrels cost more than your first house. And then the day will come when your financial adviser suggests that something has to go. You have to decide between the private jet and the vines. By then it will be too late. You will have invested in a miracle that takes place every year. You will keep your vines. As you fill his glass, you will tell the money man: \"Sell the jet.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Carla Carlisle planted Wyken Vineyards in Suffolk in 1988.

  "<p>Britain's first National Problem Gambling Clinic will open next Monday. It has been a long time coming.</p> <p>For years there has been a consensus among psychiatrists worldwide on the best way to help addicted gamblers. Treatment requires a two-pronged approach: the focus is on changing the behaviour of the addicted gambler as well as tackling anxiety, depression and drug abuse often associated with the problem, which affects an estimated 300,000 Britons. Of these, 40 per cent have suicidal tendencies.</p> <p>In most developed countries treatment consists of cognitive behaviour therapies combined with help for families and debt advice. Such holistic approaches have not been available here until now, but next week the country's first centre will accept referrals. </p> <p>The Soho clinic has received \u00a3250,000 from the gambling industry, and is headed by one of the country's leading consultant psychiatrists, Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones. </p> <p>But even before the clinic opens, she has a problem: she has funding for only one year. International colleagues tell her similar centres have required at least three years' secure funding to become established. 'If you are hiring top clinical staff you can't employ them for just a year,' says Bowden-Jones, adding: 'This country has needed a medical, psychiatric response to deal with the dual diagnosis within problem gambling for some time.' </p> <p>Last week at a Gambling and Social Responsibility Forum at Manchester Metropolitan University, leading academics and treatment specialists repeatedly complained of a lack of funding to research the growing problems associated with spread betting, fixed-odds betting terminals, and internet gambling, and its effect on youngsters and families. </p> <p>The lack of secure finance goes to the heart of a row in the gambling industry: how much should bookmakers, casino bosses, internet gambling sites, bingo operators and arcade owners contribute to clear up problems associated with the industry? Last year, the industry, which turns over \u00a355bn contributed \u00a33.5m to a treatment, education and research fund. </p> <p>The debate has set the industry-funded self-help group Gamcare at odds with the distribution body, the Responsibility in Gambling Trust (RIGT). In the background is an industry so disparate that it rarely agrees on anything. It does, however, agree on one issue: gambling industry executives say they pay billions of pounds in tax to the Treasury. In addition, they pay more than \u00a316m towards the running of the new regulator, the Gambling Commission. In other words, they already pay their fair share. Behind them stands a government which, having botched the Gambling Act, wants little to do with an industry it completely mishandled and a Gambling Commission that is still finding its feet.</p> <p>The result has been serious delays in achieving RIGT funding. Shortfalls occur most years. The UK's biggest gambling firms such as Gala Coral and Ladbrokes generally stump up the difference late in the day. But uncertainty means difficulties in distributing funds to researchers and others. </p> <p>At present, Gamcare and RIGT are at loggerheads. Gamcare wants \u00a3500,000 to embark on an advertising campaign to highlight the dangers of gambling, its response to measures by the government allowing the industry to advertise.</p> <p>RIGT, however, believes there are more pressing priorities for funding and says that, in any case, Gamcare already receives 80 per cent of what was last year a \u00a33.5m budget. This year's \u00a34.5m budget has not been agreed, though a settlement could be reached by the end of the month. </p> <p>Problems finding money are further complicated by a decrease in donors. Until recently, RIGT's coffers were swelled by US operators, eager to open Las Vegas-style supercasinos, who were currying favour. Their donations dried up after Gordon Brown killed off supercasinos. In addition, recent years have seen a number of operators merge, reducing the number of large operators. </p> <p>The most serious problem, however, is that many internet companies, which are based in tax havens such as Gibraltar and the Cayman Isles, refuse to hand over cash. Small bookmaking businesses and arcade owners generally also hold off contributions knowing that larger operators will fill the void.</p> <p>The Gambling Commission is now on the point of announcing a new structure to ensure a settled three-year funding programme. The deal would see the introduction of a voluntary levy of 0.07 per cent of turnover. But there is no guarantee that agreement will be reached. However, as one senior executive said: 'No one wants a headline that says betting firms are failing to help gambling addicts.'</p> <p>There have been suggestions that if the industry cannot agree on funding, Gordon Brown, mindful of a black hole in his finances, will introduce a compulsory levy way in excess of the relatively small sums at stake. It is thought the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, is not afraid to hit the industry.</p> <p>The highest prevalence of problem gambling comes in the areas that rely most on technology: spread betting, and fixed-odds betting terminals, which are virtual casinos, and betting exchanges on which punters can be the bookmaker. These are also the most profitable parts of the gaming industry. Some Whitehall insiders believe it may be possible to persuade Internet Service Providers to place web blocks on firms that do not contribute money.</p> <p>For the gambling industry, these are high risk stakes.</p> <h2>Chips are down</h2> <p>The UK gambling sector promised huge returns for investors with the advent of internet bookies and liberalisation of the UK's betting laws. But Gordon Brown's axing of supercasinos and the US decision to ban internet sites taking credit card details from its citizens hurt the industry badly. This has been compounded by the consumer downturn even though traditionally the gambling sector has proved resilient to recession. Europe's biggest gambling firm is Gala Coral, which is owned by a collection of private equity firms, and leveraged to the hilt. Ladbrokes and William Hill, the two biggest bookmakers, have so far coped with the slowdown though there is no guarantee this will continue. And bingo operators are feeling the pinch thanks to the smoking ban.</p>",
  "<h2>Music can change all children's lives</h2> <p>We agree classical music can and does speak to children from all backgrounds, whether they live in Hackney or Harrow, 'Liverpool gets its Rattle back' (Review, last week) .</p> <p>The government wants to give all primary-age children the opportunity to learn a musical instrument and for many thousands, this will mean learning traditional classical instruments such as the violin and clarinet. To support this, we have made \u00a342m available to buy instruments.</p> <p>Our new project In Harmony, inspired by Venezuela's El Sistema, will see children come together in the 'family' of the symphony orchestra and learn traditional orchestral instruments. At the same time, they will learn social skills and discipline.</p> <p>Children and young people will inevitably choose what music they want to listen to and play, but it is my responsibility to ensure that they are exposed to the widest possible variety. Music, as well as being fun and uplifting in its own right, can change lives. <br><strong>Andrew Adonis</strong><br>Schools Minister<br>London SW1</p> <h2>Attack was unfair</h2> <p>It is a pity a balanced article about academies ('Children of the revolution', OM, last week) was spoilt by an unfair personal attack on one of our members. </p> <p>The sad truth is that some children will never be able to pass five GCSEs regardless of where they go to school, but that does not mean their teachers do not care about them and their futures. Teachers want all pupils to be able to attend schools with the best resources and facilities and the best chance to achieve their potential. </p> <p>We believe that if the money invested in academies was fairly invested across all schools, it would benefit a far greater number of children, not just the few attending those academies. <br><strong>Mary Bousted</strong><br>General Secretary<br>Association of Teachers and Lecturers <br>London WC2</p> <h2>Talk of immigration isn't racist </h2> <p>Thank you, Andrew Anthony, for raising your head above the parapet ('The time has come to say Britain is full', Comment, last week). To discuss immigration policy is not racist. Many rational people believe that increasing numbers of humans globally will exacerbate the effects of climate change and that increasing numbers in the UK will not only make it more difficult for us to put in place initiatives to fight the effects of climate change, but also make life even less pleasant than it is for those already here. </p> <p>It was clear when, in 2004, the government invited citizens of the EU accession states to seek work here, that they used only an economic template. They failed to realise that people are not automatons and that although initially single people would come, improved economic circumstances would bring their families to join them. They failed to plan for the effects of a potentially large inflow of migrants on housing, schools, the NHS, water consumption and our roads.</p> <p>Perhaps new EU citizens, and those whose countries are safe and prosperous, should be encouraged to stay at home and build up their own countries. Perhaps, too, many of us would prefer to offer a chance to some of the poorest people of the world. <br><strong>Petra Ross</strong><br>London NW3</p> <h2>Why criminals join up</h2> <p>As a social worker in youth justice, I found your piece 'Record numbers of ex-soldiers in jail as combat leaves mental scars' (News, last week) most alarming. However, I never cease to be amazed by the number of young men with whom I work who state a desire to join the armed forces despite being involved in significant offending behaviour. </p> <p>The need for fresh young recruits seems to override the need to ensure that they satisfy basic minimum standards and the potential risk they may be to others. It is alarming to think of so many troubled and troubling young men being entrusted with the right to exercise the use of lethal force. <br><strong>David Orr</strong><br>Edinburgh</p> <h2>Vowel control, Carole</h2> <p>In 'Forget Rock, make tracks for marvellous Mwnt' (Escape, 24 August), Carole Cadwalladr claims to be Welsh, but says: 'I still find myself making snarky metropolitan comments ...' She does indeed.</p> <p>She writes: 'Not to mention the strange wondrousness of the vowel-lessness of its towns: Ynysddu, Bwlchgwyn, Eglwyswrw - hello? Are you still with me? - and my very favourites, the delightful Plwmp and the marvellous Mwnt. Repeat after me, Rhosllanerchrugog, Dwygfylchi, Blaenllechau.'</p> <p>Vowellessness names, indeed! Whereas the English possesses only five - a, e, i, o, u - Welsh has seven mellifluous vowels: a, e, i, o, u, w, y.

I cannot describe how heartening it was to read that we are not alone. </p> <p>I love being in the classroom with the children: that is the only reason I continue with my job. Why can't we be allowed to do the job we trained for? </p> <p>Another effect is that not enough good teachers who would make excellent heads have any desire to do the job. This results in a minority group of people being appointed to 'lead' schools who are either not suited or even able to carry out their role effectively.

They may have alienated some fans with the indie pop of 2006's Garden Ruin but this marks a welcome return to the hushed storytelling and mariachi rhythms they know best. <br><strong>Katie Toms</strong></p> <h2>Metronomy<br>Nights Out (Because) \u00a39.99</h2> <p>Since morphing from the solo project of producer Joseph Mount into a three-piece, Metronomy have built their reputation on spellbinding live shows. But any fears that their wonky synth-pop would lose something in translation from stage to studio prove unfounded. The soundtrack to a bad weekend, Nights Out is a dark-hearted gem, filtering a broad palette of influences \u2013 Gallic house, Italo disco, Kraftwerk, Devo \u2013 through its own lo-fi prism. 'Radio Ladio' and 'My Heart Rate Rapid' are limb-twitchers, while 'Heartbreaker' reveals aching soul. <br><strong>Hugh Montgomery</strong></p> <h2>Bryn Christopher<br>My World (Polydor) \u00a311.99</h2> <p>'New Amy Winehouses' have been all the rage this year, and now here's a male version to set marketing hearts aflutter. This 21-year-old Brummie's debut certainly boasts all the right ingredients for chart glory in 2008: precision-tooled retro-soul tunes wrapped in slick Mark Ronsonesque production and presided over by a powerhouse of a voice. It's a shame there's so little of his own personality in evidence: samples from legendary soul label Stax abound, 'Smilin'' is Gnarls Barkley's 'Crazy' divested of craziness, while a sacrilegious cover of Portishead's 'Sour Times' could be a second-rate Bond theme. <br><strong>Hugh Montgomery</strong></p> <h2>Emiliana Torrini<br>Me and Armini (Rough Trade) \u00a311.99</h2> <p>She co-wrote Kylie's 'Slow', sang on the Lord of the Rings soundtrack and has six albums to her name, but Emiliana Torrini, a singer-songwriter who would appeal to fans of Dummy-era Portishead and Stina Nordenstam, has never really become common currency here. Her seventh album (the third to be released outside her native Iceland) may fix that. It begins on a series of bright notes: the upbeat reggae swing of the title track; the jubilant hit-in-the-making, 'Jungle Drum'. Only later does the mood darken \u2013 on the one-note murder ballad 'Gun' \u2013 but by then Torrini has worked her easy charm to winning effect. <br><strong>Killian Fox</strong></p> <h2>Old Crow Medicine Show<br>Tennessee Pusher (Nettwerk) \u00a310.99</h2> <p>The epitome of born-again bluegrass crusaders, the Nashville quintet seemed to lose focus when they moved from old-time covers to their own material. Third time round, with Don Was producing, they find impressive form on originals that paint a vivid portrait of the American south and a cast of hustlers, speed freaks, good-timers and losers, while 'Motel In Memphis' offers a well-judged tribute to Martin Luther King. The Crows' jug-band aesthetic is intact but their playing is more accomplished, loping easily between fiddle laments and banjo-heavy barnstormers that brag, 'If you ain't a right winger, we'll have a humdinger.' Yee-hah to that. <br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p> <h2>Allison Neale &amp; Gary Kavanagh<br>Blue Concept (33 Jazz) \u00a312.99</h2> <p>Don't let the small dynamic range of this music put you off because it more than makes up for that in subtlety and cool elegance. Allison Neale's floating alto saxophone and Gary Kavanagh's brisk trumpet make perfect partners. Four of the 11 pieces are by Gigi Gryce, an almost forgotten jazz composer of the Fifties and Sixties, whose clever but deceptively melodious themes deserve a further hearing. The whole set hangs together beautifully, with the improvised solos discreetly contained within simple, deft arrangements. Guitarist Dave Cliff, bassist Aidan O'Donnell and drummer Matt Horne complete the band. <br><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Another fancy dress foul-up by the royals</h2> <p>It was a strange sight. Princess Eugenie stepped out for supper with her mother, the Duchess of York, and sister Princess Beatrice last Monday sporting a pair of daring fake eyelashes.</p> <p>She was, in fact, already dressed and heading on to the birthday party of Amelia Bamberger, daughter of Arnaud Bamberger, the managing director of Cartier, at Kitts Club in London's Sloane Square. </p> <p>One would have thought such a family would have an exquisite sense of taste, yet the theme was a Barbie and Ken party, hence the eyelashes. </p> <p>What was surprising, however, was the entertainment. The room was drenched in pink light, with Aqua's 'Barbie Girl' playing in the background. 'Two midgets arrived on stage, dressed up as Barbie and Ken,' reports one guest. 'They did a dance and then they presented the cake to Amelia. Some people thought it hilarious, but some of us were grimacing. It was a little uncomfortable.' </p> <p>The people of short stature, as they prefer to be known, are evidently the modern Sloane's equivalent of a gorillagram. 'Her friends organised them as a surprise,' I'm told. </p> <p>The reaction or participation of Princess Eugenie, officially the smartest royal ever after her A-level results, goes unrecorded. However, royalty has always had some rather wild ideas about fancy dress.</p> <p>Princess Diana and the then Sarah Ferguson disguised themselves as police officers, with wigs and fake glasses, and attempted to gatecrash the stag-do of Sarah's intended, Prince Andrew, at Annabel's nightclub. More recent and most infamous was Prince Harry donning an Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband for a friend's 'colonial and native' birthday party three years ago.</p> <p>Cartier's MD was at a conference in the South of France on Friday and not contactable to discuss issues of taste, good or otherwise.</p> <h2>Why men toast Keira Knightley</h2> <p>Over to the premiere party for The Duchess, where its star, Keira Knightley was discussing or, rather, not discussing her weight, a subject which has become a national debate, much to her chagrin. Why has this happened? asked Pendennis. Is it that other women are jealous of her fame, money and talent? </p> <p>Knightley, wise for her years, realises that the sisterhood may not be entirely behind her. 'Women do react very strongly to me,' she said. 'I'm told they actually divide into people who love me and people who hate me, a little like Marmite. I try not to think about it.' </p> <p>She can at least be assured of the support of the brotherhood - it is still difficult to find a man who can't wax lyrical about her merits.</p> <h2>Are they by any chance related? </h2> <p>It's been a nagging question ever since Sarah Palin was announced as John McCain's running mate. Is she related to Michael Palin? It has even intrigued the Monty Python star. Palin, who dipped his toes in the Alaskan snows in his travel series Full Circle in 1997, is keen to investigate.</p> <p>'I'd like to know if we're related,' he told me at the Foyles summer party at the bookshop's Charing Cross Road headquarters in London on Wednesday. 'I'm not sure I would vote for her, but I've been lapping up all the coverage about her family and everything. I suppose we must be related if you go back far enough. Maybe the BBC will have me on Who Do You Think You Are? and then I could find out.'</p> <p>Perhaps the hockey mom should get him on board her campaign? After all, Palin wrote a great, if confusing, homage to North American culture in the form of his Monty Python song, which opens with the line: 'I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK ...' Admittedly, it was more about Canada than Alaska, but what's a bit of tundra in between?</p> <h2>Tory fundraiser turns air blue</h2> <p>David Cameron and Michael Spencer are good friends, but does the Conservative leader know his chief fundraiser's reputation in the City? Spencer, chief executive of inter-broker dealer Icap and worth around \u00a31bn, might be smooth-talking a lot of City men into donating to the Tories, but his language is not always quite so urbane. One business associate reports that his manners in the boardroom have taken even the toughest of City men aback. He has been known to rage and swear at colleagues 'in an alarming manner,' says the associate. 'He has the most explosive temperament of anyone I've encountered in decades in the Square Mile.'</p> <h2>Facebook's revenge </h2> <p>Facebook has banned one of London's most popular men. Gary Pulsifer, publisher at Arcadia Books, has had his profile removed from the social networking site for, apparently, being too popular. 'They told me that I had been banned for adding on too many friends. They have a set rate at which you can add people' says Pulsifer, who counts feminist Erica Jong, novelist Emma Tennant and Andrew Hosken, biographer of Ken Livingstone among his authors. Consumer groups in the US have noted that a number of profiles are being taken down because overactive members register are suspected by the site of being bogus or spam users. Still, it's not all bad for Pulsiver. 'I had about 1,500 friends ... it did become a bit obsessive.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Marre is away</p>",
  "<p>Pinot blanc is a white-berried mutation of the red grape pinot noir, widely planted in Alsace, northern Italy (as pinot bianco), Germany and Austria (as weissburgunder). For many years, no distinction was made between pinot blanc and chardonnay, because the two varieties can look very similar, and indeed relatively recent DNA analysis has shown that they are both members of the extended pinot family.</p> <p>In general, pinot blanc offers the body of chardonnay with rather less individuality and ageing potential. Pinot blanc has a tendency to blandness unless yields are held in check.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Pinot blanc was originally grown in Burgundy, but is no longer grown there in any quantity. Alsace is its French stronghold now, where it is regarded as something of a workhorse, providing basic dry white.</p> <h2>Austria</h2> <p>Pinot blanc has generally been held in higher esteem by the Germans than by the French - they have more plantings - but it is in Austria that the grape reaches its greatest heights. Accounting for about 6% of the country's total vineyards, it is grown in all regions, notably Burgenland. It is used to create often age-worthy dry varietals with an almond-like scent, but achieves its greatest glory in superb botrytised sweet wines, up to TBA levels (Trockenbeerenauslese - very sweet!). It is often blended, typically with welschriesling.</p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>In Italy, pinot bianco was confused with and worshipped as chardonnay for years and is still made in that vaguely round but crisp style, as well as being used extensively for sparkling wine. Germans, who have very little chardonnay planted, tend increasingly to make ambitious dry weissburgunders using all the chardonnay tricks of barrel fermentation and the like, sometimes with great success. The variety is also grown widely, sometimes called beli pinot, throughout central Europe and is increasingly treasured as an alternative to chardonnay in California. Thanks to a case of mistaken identity, some wines labelled pinot blanc in the US are actually made from the grape melon (or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/07/19\">melon de Bourgogne</a>).</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Philippe Zinck Pinot Blanc 2007 Alsace, France <br>\u00a36.99, Majestic </strong></p> <p>This is quite a rich pinot blanc for its price, with some viscosity, and orange rind and pear tart.

  "<p>The king is dead. Where is the king? It was only four months ago that Lawrence Dallaglio led Wasps to Premiership glory here amid the most emotional of scenes. The talismanic back-row forward, who captained his club with such distinction for more than a decade, has departed from the greensward and Wasps were a shadow of a side without him.</p> <p>The champions were outfought and outthought at every turn by a London Irish team who were quicker of mind and fleeter of foot and who thoroughly deserved a victory that was orchestrated by Mike Catt, pulling the strings from fly-half, and Nick Kennedy, who enjoyed a barnstorming gamed in the engine room. Two late, opportunist tries by Tom Rees and Eoin Reddan merely served to flatter Wasps, who were shapeless and rudderless for much of a game that they will wish to forget in a hurry.</p> <p>This was also, of course, the first match in which the experimental law variations - or ELVs, as they are more commonly known - were on show in the Premiership as part of a global year-long trial. Certainly it will take some time for players and officials to get used to them, and time will be the judge of whether they have been a success. The majority of them appear fair enough, such as the introduction of an offside line five metres behind the back foot of a set scrum and being able to throw backwards when taking a quick line-out. Also, there is now no gain in territory if the ball is passed back into a team's 22 and then kicked directly into touch. Fair enough.</p> <p>Additionally, there is now no restriction in the numbers that either side are permitted to employ at the line-out, which is dubious at best. But the ELV that really wrankles is the one that allows a defending side to pull down a maul. Absolute, complete and total madness. The maul is an intrinsic and valuable part of the game of rugby union - and the sooner the chumps that forced it through see the error of their ways the better.</p> <p>Moving on from that little rant, meanwhile, it was the Exiles who were first on the scoreboard in the eighth minute. And an interesting try it was, too. Not so much because Kennedy, who toured New Zealand with England in the summer, did outstandingly well to get a fingertip to a Raphael Iba\u00f1ez throw on a Wasps five-metre line-out, thereby causing Simon Shaw to palm the ball back loosely. It was interesting because Wasps used only five men at the line-out, compared with Irish's seven. And it cost them dear as Chris Hala'Ufia, the Tonga No 8 who was making his debut for the Irish, scooped up the ball and flopped over from short range. </p> <p>It was a touchdown that served to invigorate Irish, who dominated the rest of the first period, even though they were temporarily without Hala'Ufia, who was sent to the cooler for deliberately tripping Reddan after the Wasps scrum-half had taken a quick tap penalty. The Exiles actually extended their lead in his absence when Peter Hewat slotted a penalty from in front of the posts after his own searing run had turned the Wasps defence inside and out.</p> <p>With Catt keeping the opposition defence on the back foot with some intelligent kicking into open spaces and getting his backline moving to good effect with some typically adroit distribution, it was the Exiles who looked more like the defending champions. Sailosi Tagicakibau, the Samoa wing, was a handful every time he got the ball - and he saw plenty of it.</p> <p>In fact, Wasps were dire in the first period, creating very little of note in attack and allowing the Exiles to break over the gainline almost at will. Quite what Ian McGeechan and Shaun Edwards, the Wasps coaching team, said to their charges at half-time, by when Hewat had added a second penalty to increase the lead to 13-0, is anyone's guess. But it will not have been of the 'keep it up, chaps' variety, that's for sure.</p> <p>Their charges obviously weren't listening. After Delon Armitage had narrowly missed with a penalty attempt from just inside his own half, Richard Thorpe, the Exiles' blindside, broke through a couple of limp tackles directly from a line-out to help extend the Irish lead to 20-0, and that was just about that. Rees, who was one of the better Wasps players, strolled to the line on the hour mark after the ball had squirted out of a ruck on the Irish 22, but the trusty boot of Hewat kept the champions, who were slightly improved after the resumption, at arm's length.</p> <p>Did the ELVs make a difference? They certainly allowed more time and space for the attacking side at scrum time, which was a positive thing, and the tempo of the game, which was by no means a classic, was not dissimilar to a typical Premiership match last season. But there was precious little mauling. And that was sad.</p> <p><strong>Twickenham </strong>52,087</p> <p><strong>LONDON IRISH </strong>Hewat; Ojo, D Armitage, Mapusua, Tagicakibau; Catt (capt; Hickey 67), Hodgson </p> <p>(Richards 74); Corbisiero (Murphy 48), Coetzee </p> <p>(Paice 61), Rautenbach (Corbisiero 61; Buckland 78), Johnson, Kennedy, Thorpe, S Armitage, Hala'Ufia (Fisher 80)</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Hala'ufia, Thorpe <strong>Cons</strong> Hewat 2 <strong>Pens</strong> Hewat 4</p> <p><strong>WASPS </strong>Van Gisbergen (Mitchell 70); Sackey, Waldouck, Lewsey (Staunton ht), Voyce; Flutey, Reddan; Payne, Iba\u00f1ez (capt; Webber 70), Barnard (Vickery 52), Shaw, Birkett (Palmer 52), Worsley, Rees, Haskell (Hart 61)</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Rees, Reddan <strong>Cons</strong> Van Gisbergen, Staunton</p>",
  "<p>Bravo to Lily Allen for telling Elton John to 'F-off' while they were co-hosting the GQ awards. She seems to be regretting it (her Facebook page says she's 'dying inside'), but it sounds hilarious: Lily guzzling champagne and swearing while announcing winners; Elton becoming increasingly angry about her alcohol consumption, taking her aside for stern words before finally making a waspish comment in front of the audience.</p> <p>At which point, Lily said: 'Fuck off, Elton, I am 40 years younger than you and have my whole life ahead of me.' Elton spluttered back: 'I could still snort you under the table.' A fine riposte, but it was too late - the former coke/sex/whatever fiend turned self-styled saviour of celebrity souls had finally and most unambiguously been told where to get off. And with all due respect Mr John, not before time.</p> <p>Admittedly, Lily, who says she and Elton are friends, didn't exhibit the classiest of behaviour, but who does when they're roaring drunk and 23? Anyway, she made a good point. What is Elton if not a prime example of a group I've long identified as Born Again Prims? It's fine for them to misspend their youths in a blizzard of sex, cocaine and debauchery. However, after they've hit middle age and 'reformed', they seemingly dedicate their lives to trying to stop other, mainly younger, people enjoying their own wild years.</p> <p>It wouldn't matter so much, but Elton, a musical hero of mine, has form. George Michael found himself described by Elton as 'in a strange place [with] a deep-rooted unhappiness in his life' in the respected psychiatric publication Heat magazine. Robbie Williams has told of how 'weird' it felt to be frogmarched to rehab by Elton. Donatella Versace, Pete Doherty and Rufus Wainwright are all alleged recipients of what appears to be the Elton John Rehab Pyramid Scheme.</p> <p>One has to ask: who do Elton John and his husband David Furnish think they are, mooching about 'saving' people? It's as if they've become the Jehovah's Witnesses of celebrity sobriety, with everyone scared to open the door to them in case they get a fat lecture and a 12-step pamphlet. Imagine how a decadent celebrity's heart might plummet when they see that pair coming round the corner with their Holland &amp; Barrett bags of multivitamins. They probably hide behind the sofa, thinking: 'I've spent all my money on drugs, my career is over, my nose has gone all Danielle Westbrook, but I really must have hit rock bottom if Elton and David want to help.'</p> <p>Elton is not the only one. Most famously, Madonna has been much given in recent years to opining that daughter Lourdes will not be watching TV, eating ice cream or dating boys before the age of 18. Such moral rigidity, from a woman who once simulated masturbation onstage as a choreographed part of her act and cavorted with her front botty hanging out in the hilarious, much underrated book, Sex</p> <p>It doesn't have to be this way. Rock band Aerosmith were, if anything, wilder than Elton, but are clean living these days, with group members looking as if they're only held together by very weak Sellotape. They don't nag younger stars about sobriety and rehab programmes, but unfortunately they may be the exception.</p> <p>The only thing more boring than yet another picture of a 'tired and emotional' Amy Winehouse staggering about in a stained bra and pants buying ice pops at 4.30 in the morning is the thought of the tedious interviews she may give when she finally gets clean, droning away in fluent 'Californian' about 'finding herself, accepting she has a problem, blah blah. I want to warn all young people about the dangers of drugs, alcohol and having hair like a giant backcombed merkin'. The point is that maybe they don't want, or need, to be warned.</p> <p>Even five years ago, I was thinking there simply can't be a young person in Britain today, in the entertainment industry or otherwise, so thick as to think 'copious amounts of alcohol and class A drugs are a good and healthy choice for me'. Therefore, in 2008, surely any attempt to educate, change or indeed bombard them with censure, disdain and unasked-for advice at an awards ceremony would surely be the height of pointlessness.</p> <p>This is the great unwritten law of hedonism: listen to yourself, because only you will recognise the moment when you've had that magical amount 'enough'. The rest is just premature middle age forced upon you by elders who, with their pasts, shouldn't be throwing GQ awards in glasshouses. Lily was right the first time - Elton has had his fun, now it's her turn and, from where I'm sitting, she's a damn sight better behaved than he used to be.</p> <h2>If your lower limbs are beginning to wither and you're becoming dangerously obese, blame Google</h2> <p>Considering that Google is now 10 years old, how come we don't all hate it? Used by 70 per cent of browsers, worth \u00a375bn, Google seems to have somehow sidestepped the automatic global brand hatred of, say, a Microsoft or McDonald's. </p> <p>Simple, free, reliable, with adverts subtle enough not to drive you potty, Google is not only a design classic of web technology, but it appears to be our search engine friend. Why, then, do I suspect that it wants to rewire my brain and then eat it?</p> <p>It's not that there's anything bad or inefficient about Google; on the contrary, it might be too good. The better it gets, the more I seem to turn into a spoon-fed idiot who couldn't survive in the real world. As it is, I can't do much without using Google any more. I've noticed this before: whether it is finding a restaurant, sourcing products or fact-checking, I'm either Googling or I'm lost. </p> <p>This can't be healthy. Talking of which, I'm starting to wonder if Google may be guiltier than McDonald's of aggravating global obesity. On the one hand, a Big Mac with fries; on the other, barely having to move a muscle while doing things that used to entail days of sweaty exertion. I've just been organising my daughter's birthday party and all I've done is Google internet sites and - ooh, the effort - reach for a bankcard. </p> <p>Did I used to be this lazy? Well, yes, but only when I could get away with it. Now, because of Google, I nearly always get away with it. </p> <p>Indeed, I've got a terrible fear that one day I'll get off my chair and just fall to the floor, because my legs will have been rendered evolutionarily unnecessary for my ultra-sedentary Google lifestyle. They'll wither and, in their place, I'll grow two giant forefingers with which to type 'Google', and a flesh version of one of those festival hats with cans and straws. My corpse will be found in years to come, stuck fast to the keyboard, my eyes open, screaming their own terrible story. </p> <p>Is this Google's fiendish plot, to render us all helpless and dependent, then take over the world? How can we stop them? By Googling 'How to stop Google'? This needs earnestly debating before the next 10 years are up. Where's that nice David Icke when you need him?</p> <h2>Apparently, it's not in their jeans, it's in their genes</h2> <p>Grazia magazine ran a moving story last week about Tanya Rowe, 28, who is suffering from breast cancer and has only months to live. Tanya was trying to be strong and positive, despite her heartache at leaving behind son Charlie and fiance Jason, whom she'd just recently met, but who had asked her to be his wife despite her illness, and even offered to care for Charlie after her death. </p> <p>Last week, Grazia ran a follow up. Jason's other girlfriend had seen the article and rung Tanya. According to Tanya, Jason's reason for cheating was: 'It's been really tough on me with your illness. You've given me no emotional support.' Quite. It's all 'me, me, me' with these terminal cancer sufferers, isn't it? </p> <p>Understandably, Tanya does not want to waste the precious time she has left hating Jason, so I thought I'd do it for her. However, just as I was settling into a pleasant daydream imagining Jason being plunged headfirst into a cauldron of boiling oil, amid the flames of a karmic hell, a newspaper article caught my eye.</p> <p>According to a study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, certain men may be genetically programmed to be unfaithful. In what has been hailed as the 'divorce gene', it's all to with some hormonal bonding thingie called vasopressin being out of synch. So, according to the study, these unfaithful men (not women strangely) are hormonally fated to cheat on their partners and seek sex elsewhere. </p> <p>The article had some other points about how genetics was never the full story (some unsubstantiated guff about how, nevertheless, there is still personal responsibility for one's actions), but I'm afraid I stopped reading there. It was all too much. I mean, Jason, if you're reading, you tell me: does male suffering never end?</p>",
  "<p>Although she gives quite the opposite impression on meeting her, there must be something innately restless about Billie Piper. Even at school in her home town of Swindon, she was desperate to get started. 'I was freakishly ambitious. I didn't want to be a child. I wanted my own flat, to work and be a grown up.' At 15, Piper was propelled, via the Sylvia Young theatre school, into a pop career, which, according to her 2006 autobiography, Growing Pains, led to her combining chart success with anorexia. Marriage to Chris Evans was followed by the most amicable divorce in showbiz history and the career-forging role of Dr Who's assistant Rose. Last year, there was more controversy when Piper took on the role of Hannah/Belle, the high-class prostitute in Secret Diary of a Call Girl. </p> <p>Quite a lot for a young woman only just about to turn 26? 'Yes, I do think sometimes that I've lived about three different lives,' grins Piper when we meet to talk at a central London hotel. Six months pregnant, petite, with honey-brown hair, Piper is articulate, funny and self deprecating, as well as disarmingly friendly, pulling her clothes tighter to show me her bump. Filming the second series of Call Girl, they had to work around the pregnancy, her first child, with her husband, actor Laurence Fox. 'Towards the end, it was all the back of my head or in shadow, like something from The Phantom of the Opera,' she sighs in her soft, lilting voice. 'So embarrassing.'</p> <p>Is she enjoying being pregnant? Yes, says Piper, though she is clearly nervous. (Towards the end of our conversation, we get stuck into the nitty gritty of epidurals, natural childbirth and Caesareans, but I wish we hadn't - the memory of Billie's huge, apprehensive eyes haunts me for days.)</p> <p>'Some women are all about this glowing, blooming thing, aren't they?' she says. 'I haven't really tapped into that. I've basically replaced all my vices for a new one - control. I've had about 10 scans and I bought one of those baby heart monitor things. Such a bad idea - its like listening to a huge shell on the beach,' Piper smiles. 'But I do love it. The whole thing is just so sweet, tender and adorable.'</p> <p>While the first series of Call Girl concentrated almost exclusively on Belle, as she embarked on everything from lesbian romps to saddling up a client, the new one delves deep into Hannah's emotional life. 'There are still sexual encounters, but now there's one an episode instead of three.' Piper grins. 'There's going to be a lot of pissed-off men.'</p> <p>Was she taken aback by the furore surrounding the first series -it was accused of glamorising prostitution? 'I thought there would be a fuss but I didn't think people would be so up in arms,' she says. Piper was aware of the grim realities of prostitution. 'The drug-fuelled sex trafficking side of things that you read about in the media. But I met girls who have a very different story, especially the woman who wrote the book and the blog. They were adamant they didn't consider themselves victims.' What about the charge that it might inspire someone to become a prostitute? 'Did we? I think people have common sense and can tell what's real, what's right or what's wrong and work it out.'</p> <p>In fairness, Call Girl seems so glossy, so knowingly camp that it's difficult to find it any more shocking or immoral than, say, Mistresses. Nor did it shy from the fact that Belle's true amour is cash, not sex. Piper nods. 'When I met Belle, she made it clear that first and foremost it's about the cash.' In fact, Piper suspects that money was behind the reaction to Call Girl. 'The only difference between this show and Sex and the City seemed to be the money changing hands. There is so much sexual liberation, but the minute a woman lies on her back and takes cash for it, that changes everything.'</p> <p>On a different tack, surely it felt odd, playing a prostitute while pregnant? Piper confirms that she had a body double for the second series. 'My instincts had changed,' she says. 'Certain things repulsed me - just other people's bodily smells. Not that we were sniffing each other's groins or anything. It was just being that close to an actor who wasn't my husband, having people touch me. Suddenly I felt quite...' Sensitive? 'Yes.'</p> <p>Her hands flutter unthinkingly near her bump. 'And more emotional. My senses were just a lot more alive, so acute and strong.'</p> <p>Saying that, Piper felt bemused by the reaction to her sex scenes in the first series. 'I'm playing a prostitute. I have sex. If that's going to be a problem, I should have thought about it before filming. You can't turn up and be prudish on the day.' </p> <p>It's probable that Piper's huge success in Dr Who played a large part in the 'shock horror'. People don't want to see Rose playing a whore (Or they do - which is a whole other issue.) Did Piper take on Belle to avoid being typecast as Rose? 'It's more about my always wanting to do something quite far away from the last job because I get bored so easily,' says Piper, suddenly earnest. 'That's one of the best things about acting - you know, when you get to learn about all sorts of different people.'</p> <p>Born in 1982, Piper, the oldest of four siblings, was only 15 when she was handpicked for pop stardom, going to number one with 'Because We Want to'. Piper is clear eyed about her vocal talents. 'I sometimes think: would I have gone on X Factor? And no, I wouldn't - I wouldn't have been good enough. These people work so hard and they sing live. I mimed throughout my entire pop career.'</p> <p>While she was a pop star, Piper became increasingly estranged from her parents. 'I had very bad phone etiquette,' she says. 'Mostly it was because I wanted to punish them. I wanted them to just be my parents and talk about things that weren't related to what people were saying about me. Now I feel awful about some of the things I said. 'Has being pregnant made her think about her relationship with her parents? 'More and more. It's funny, isn't it?'</p> <p>What about the anorexia and poor body image? 'I think it was because I saw so many grown-ups living destructive lifestyles, maybe skipping breakfast, drinking copious amounts of coffee and Diet Coke, smoking fags and being slim and desirable and successful.' Does she worry it will return? Piper shakes her head. 'I know that what I go through now is no worse than what my best friends go through who have a relatively healthy relationship with food. Everyone's fucked these days, aren't they? Men too. I mean, men who talk about food endlessly - it's so depressing.'</p> <p>Feeling lonely, unfulfilled, and self-destructive, at 18, Piper met Evans. The next day he sent round a silver Ferrari full of roses. Six months later they were married. A huge fuss was made of their 16-year age difference and the paparazzi photographs of Billie in her pyjamas pushing trolleys full of booze out of supermarkets. You had to wonder - was she depressed? Was she in hiding? </p> <p>'People seem to consider that I had a serious meltdown,' says Piper. 'That I married an older man and got pissed in my pyjamas for two years. But these were important formative years for me. Just to relax and care about things that weren't related to what I was doing before.'</p> <p>Since their highly amicable divorce (Piper refused to take a penny in alimony), they have remained close friends, Evans eventually going on to marry golfing journalist Natasha Shishmanian, with whom he is expecting a baby. Does Piper look back on her time with Evans now as a healing period? 'I do, but not in a creepy way. I don't consider my years with Chris as some kind of rehabilitation.'</p> <p>That's offensive to him? 'Massively offensive. And really offensive to the relationship we had and continued to have. Even though he did help me, it's not as if we were spending all our time talking about our problems and then going out and getting wrecked.' She bursts out laughing. 'We were just going out and getting wrecked.'</p> <p>Once Piper's acting took off, it seemed there was no stopping her, with appearances in productions as diverse as The Canterbury Tales and Ruby in the Smoke. She was outstanding as Fanny Price in Mansfield Park. And, of course, there is her massive, award-winning success in the revitalised Dr Who. While Piper is quick to acknowledge that Rose 'put her on the map', she seems to find her Dr Who fame equal parts unnerving and amusing.</p> <p>'It can become the topic of every conversation. You'll be at a wedding and somebody will say, \"Do you remember that episode?\" And these are grown men! Sweet as it is, I do find it hard work, though very funny.'</p> <p>More recently, Piper went to Toys R Us to look at nursery equipment. 'Suddenly, all these kids are chuckling and following you around. And you turn a corner and there are dolls of you everywhere and massive pictures. It's quite frightening.' Piper smiles wryly. 'I think it must be hard being David [Tennant]. I get a certain level of attention but - I've seen it in action - he can't move for attention.'</p> <p>Where fame is concerned, Piper keeps a low profile, especially since becoming pregnant, preferring to stay at home in West Sussex with Fox (he starred in Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Gosford Park and TV's Lewis). 'I'm not trying to congratulate myself on not going to premieres, but if you don't want to court that shit every day of your life, you can avoid it.' It helps, she says, that Fox, whom she calls Lol, is 'a low-key, chilled guy. He likes doing the work, but he's not into that stuff'.</p> <p>Endearingly, Piper admits to a gossip mag habit of her own. 'I know I shouldn't!' Would she mind not being famous? 'I would find it quite strange at first, if I'm honest,' she says. 'It's all I've known for the past 10 or 11 years.'</p> <p>Another key role for Piper was Christopher Hampton's Treats, not only her West End debut, but also where she met and fell in love with Fox. Piper admits she found the play 'really hard'. 'I felt slightly out of my league, which is why I wanted to do it,' she says 'But the nature of the role was tough. Breaking down in tears every night, being the victim of this man's verbal abuse. And just being there every night, everybody knowing where you are.' Piper shakes her head. 'I was quite honest about the fact that I was finding it a hard experience when I was doing press. I think that fuelled those rumours that I was having some kind of breakdown, which wasn't true.</p> <p>'I was also falling madly in love with this guy and that makes you quite weak and vulnerable. I wanted to be good in it myself, but also for him.'</p> <p>Piper smiles shyly, pushing back a strand of hair. 'So every time I went on, there were all these things to consider and I thought: why am I doing this? It's terrifying!'</p> <p>Nevertheless, she says she'd try a stage play again. 'At first, I thought I never could, but now I really would.' Her lips twitch. 'Though not for a long run.'</p> <p>What about the intimidating-sounding 'Fox acting dynasty' (Laurence is the son of James, nephew of Edward, cousin to Emilia and all the rest of it)? 'Acting dynasty?' shrieks Piper with delight. 'I never know what that means. I go around to their house and they're just really loving. I don't find that remotely intimidating. If anything, I find it refreshing. I really want to be part of that.'</p> <p>She's quite the homebody isn't she? 'I really am. I always have been.' Does marriage stabilise her? 'I just believe in marriage. I believe in being with someone for ever. Even though my marriage to Chris didn't work, I still don't consider it a failed marriage - it just came to its natural end. It didn't make me feel like I never wanted to get married again. I like sharing things with somebody.'</p> <p>An unfair question - why didn't she have children with Chris Evans? 'I just never thought about it,' says Piper. 'I was young and I suppose we'd broken up by the time I'd have started thinking about it. It was just never an issue.' With Fox, it was different. 'When we moved in together, I did start thinking about it, on my own. You know -\"I'd love to have your baby because I just think you'd be brilliant. And I would really love to share that with you.\" But I didn't tell him.'</p> <p>Piper seems desperately in love. Does it help that they're both actors, in that they understand each other's jobs? 'I don't think anyone understands anyone's job,' laughs Piper. 'We all have the same hang-ups. I get jealous if I know Laurence is kissing someone else.' That seems a bit unfair - he has to watch you in Secret Diary of a Call Girl. 'Yes, but he's very grown up and I'm quite childish. But this actor thing - I don't think it benefits a relationship in that way. I still call up and go [she adopts a whine], \"But you said you would be back at seven.\" Even though I do exactly the same thing for a living, I still act like I simply can't understand how he can do this to me.' </p> <p>As the interview winds to a close, I realise that there's been none of the usual talk of future plans. And that's because Piper has no plans bar imminent motherhood. 'Lol is working a lot. I just imagine being with the baby on my own when he's not around. That's how I picture it.' And that's a good picture? 'Yes I like it.' </p> <p>Certainly, Piper exhibits none of the usual actor-jumpiness about the next job and says she spends her days pottering about, catching up on TV boxed sets and movies (she adores the Judd Apatow ensemble players in Superbad and Knocked Up: 'They all look so nice!').</p> <p>'I don't know how I'm going to feel when the baby comes, so I don't want to commit to anything,' says Piper, fairly reasonably. Indeed, any creative restlessness in her make-up seems dormant for now. 'You know, I just feel really content at the moment,' says Piper. 'I've done quite a lot of stuff and I don't have to feel desperate to do anything that radical or wild. I've set myself all these challenges and worked through them. I just feel I'm ready to be a mum now.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Secret Diary of a Call Girl starts on Thursday September 11, on ITV2</p> <h2>Billie Piper, a life</h2> <p><strong>1982</strong> Lianne Paul Piper is born in Swindon on 22 September to Paul Piper and Mandy Kent.</p> <p><strong>1998</strong> Becomes the youngest-ever artist to debut at number one, aged 15, with 'Because We Want To'.</p> <p><strong>1999 </strong>Receives two Brit Award nominations and Smash Hits' accolade of best female star.</p> <p><strong>2001</strong> Marries Chris Evans in secret in Las Vegas.

  "<p><strong>Hedda</strong> <br>Gate, London W11 </p> <p><strong>The Collector</strong> <br>Arcola, London E8 </p> <p><strong>Liberty</strong> <br>Globe, London SE1 </p> <p>Tom Mison is having one of the headiest months a 25-year-old actor could wish for. On telly he's getting snogged as Mr Bingley in Lost in Austen. On stage he's getting snubbed as the compliant husband in another updated classic: Lucy Kirkwood's Hedda transplants Hedda Gabler to 21st-century Notting Hill.</p> <p>Mison and his stage sibling Cath Whitefield (in Ibsen's play the character is an aunt) are the unexpected vivid centre of Carrie Cracknell's intriguing production. Earnest, unstylish and amiable, they subtly suggest shared genes and a common background. Mison has the effortful jokiness of the humourless person: he's a head-in-his-text don for whom the only alternative to seriousness is flippancy. Handed his old slippers by his sister, he wags them on his hands like glove puppets: 'My slip-slops,' he proclaims to his wincing wife. </p> <p>Kirkwood ingeniously updates Hedda's destruction of the masterpiece written by her old admirer, who's played with volcanic fervour by Adrian Bower. She creates an unexpected deed with a memory stick, a deed that's not merely clever but central to the play's imagery, and a surprise that shouldn't be spoilt by being described. Not all her modernisings are as successful. Crucially, it's not clear why this Hedda is trapped in inertia: the sleek Cara Horgan is so replete with tedium that she can hardly be bothered to lower her eyelids in disdain. She talks of herself as 'damaged', and a druggy past would make sense, but when she comes to bump herself off, she does it in 19th-century style with an improbably available pistol. </p> <p>Ibsen's brilliance was to make his vital heroine ineffective while her fluffy schoolmate behaves like a new woman. That dynamic is disrupted when it no longer seems radical to leave your husband and sort out another man's notes. So the evening is never dull but rarely disturbing.</p> <p>At the Arcola, a girl - peach-faced, with swinging hair - is seen on film, dapping from St Martins school of art to Leicester Square to a cafe. The film freezes. She's caught as in a newspaper shot, forever laughing. And then seen in less glowing flesh: bound on a bed, in a cellar room that's got up to be girly, save for the cases of dead butterflies. A man stands nearby, flatly explaining to the audience why he has imprisoned her: she is the only one for him.</p> <p>Ben Caplan's astute production of The Collector, aptly staged in a basement, goes to the chilly heart of John Fowles's novel. This is a thriller which hinges not only on sexual frustration but on a ubiquitous class consciousness: it continually shocks by the extent of its despair and its all-round dislikeableness. The abductor, a poor fish who's recently won a load of money, is emotionally inadequate and educationally deprived: 'He hasn't coloured it in yet,' he complains of an artist's sketch. His victim is troubled and casually snobbish: 'Some of my best friends come from your kind of background.' Rosalind Drury, though sometimes over-emphatic, rightly suggests she is tricky as well as tricked. Mark Fleischmann is horribly level and deliberate.</p> <p>The stage is currently laden with adaptations. The poet Glyn Maxwell has based Liberty on Anatole France's 1912 novel Les Dieux ont soif, which charts the decline of the French Revolution from idealism to terror through the figure of an artist-turned-magistrate, a surrogate Robespierre. His play features pantaloons and persiflage, tumbrils lurching through the groundlings, and some fine banter, alongside nudges towards the 21st century to do with repressing human rights in the interests of state security. </p> <p>The opening is deliciously light and pointed, helped by a droll performance by Ellie Piercy as a Revolutionary seamstress ('Where would we be without embroidery? We'd be overrun by tyrants!') and the scamper of Guy Retallack's direction: anyone who thinks the Globe can't be intimate is yet again proved wrong. But the arc of the play is predictable, the evening greatly over-extended: by the time the women are distraught in their petticoats and the hero has gone to the bad, the surprises have vanished, and you'll wish you'd brought your knitting to sit with by the guillotine.</p>",
  "<p>The small, pretty college town of Northfield, Minnesota, is only an hour's drive south of urban St Paul, site of the Republican National Convention, but it is a world away. A welcoming sign promises 'Cows, colleges and contentment'. Its main street bustles with shoppers and its town square boasts a food fair selling fried cheese curds and corn dogs on sticks.</p> <p>It is quintessential small-town America, surrounded by fields, farms and lakes and where everyone seems to boast a Scandinavian or German surname. It is in Northfield - and thousands of small towns like it - that the impact of Sarah Palin on the race for the White House will be judged. So far the jury on Palin seems to be out. 'It is easy to talk big. But delivering big is a whole different story,' said Sandy Molkenbur, as she swept the floors of the town's flower shop.</p> <p>There is no doubt that John McCain's surprising choice for Vice-President has electrified a race already long on drama. Alaska's female governor has rejuvenated the Republican party. She is wildly popular with its conservative base and has brought glamour, sex appeal and star quality to a McCain campaign lacking all three. She has revived the culture wars and put guns and God into the election. Gone are the old themes of the economy and Iraq; here are the ancient battles of abortion rights, evolution in schools and a contest to see whose faith is the most genuine. She wants to be the revenge of Middle America against what she sees as the media-dominated elites of Washington. Emerging from the suburban national psyche, she has cast herself as an avenging angel going to war against the old Republican enemies of big city liberalism and big government.</p> <p>In one week on the national stage seldom has one woman earned so many nicknames so fast. She is 'Hurricane Sarah', 'Pitbull Sarah', 'Sarah Barracuda' and 'Sarah Joan of Arc'. She has dominated the headlines in a way that even Barack Obama will find difficult to match. But Palin's new status carries a downside every bit as big as its upside. As she embarks on two months of relentless campaigning, under the spotlight of the 24-hour news cycle, the opportunities for mistakes are boundless. 'I have never heard such a divergence of views as that on Sarah Palin,' said conservative political strategist Vin Weber. 'It is either a goldmine or a disaster.'</p> <p>It is easy to forget how much Palin had been written off before last Wednesday's speech. After an avalanche of stories devoted to Palin's unmarried daughter's pregnancy and Palin's record in office, she seemed close to becoming a political disaster. In unguarded moments conservative commentators were brutally frank. Discussing Palin off-air on a TV talk show, and unaware their microphone was still on, conservative columnist Peggy Noonan and Republican strategist Mike Murphy were brutally frank only hours before Palin took the stage. 'It's not going to work,' said Murphy. 'It's over,' Noonan agreed. The clip was an instant YouTube hit.</p> <p>Those comments reflected a genuine anger among party mandarins. They saw Palin's pick as cynical marketing to tempt female voters marooned after Hillary Clinton failed to make the Democratic ticket. They grumbled that it appeared panicky. That anger increased when the flow of negative stories about Palin threatened to become a flood. Certainly it seemed she had barely been checked over. 'It is hard to believe that the McCain campaign really vetted Palin to the extent they say. It looks like they didn't even Google her,' said Roger Simon, chief political columnist of the website Politico.</p> <p>But Palin, in one of the most remarkable speeches of recent political history, turned all that around. She brought the Republican house down with a robust defence of suburban values, her family's history and a brutal attack on Obama. She painted herself as a 'hockey mom' doing battle against the elites of Washington, fighting for the little guy and doing it all in killer heels. She mocked Obama as inexperienced and even aimed a blow at his wife, Michelle. Words that seemed harmless, such as 'community organiser', became insults dripping with venom. Then, for good measure, she took on the media, slamming it for questioning her record. She was so powerful that delegates in the crowd shook their fists at the watching press boxes. It was a bravura performance, but the best news came the next day from TV ratings firm Nielsen. A staggering 37 million Americans had been watching, only one million fewer than had seen Obama deliver his convention speech. And Palin had been carried live on only six networks, compared to Obama's 10.</p> <p>The speech revealed all the positives of putting Palin on the ticket. As she cradled her baby son in her arms, few could have failed to be moved by the sight as a historic moment for women. As columnist Nancy Gibbs noted: 'You felt the shattered glass raining gently down.' But Palin also stoked the flames burning under the Republican base. She is an ideologically pure evangelical and now the party's sweetheart. There is no doubting that much of Palin's appeal rests in her biography and its presentation. She does not look like a normal politician. She looks like what she says she is at heart: a mother who got into politics via the parent-teacher association at her local school. Or to put it another way: she looks like the voters she is aiming at. That is a powerful weapon in an election where centrist women could be key. Had McCain played safely, choosing an established male figure, those voters would likely not be in play at all. Palin was a risky bet that so far has paid off. '(McCain) is an underdog. He knows he's an underdog. He has got to roll the dice,' said Dr Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.</p> <p>The gamble remains risky and full of unknowns. The pregnancy of her daughter sent a shudder through some Republicans. So did the news that her husband was once ticketed for drunk driving. Palin herself is mired in an investigation in Alaska into whether or not she tried to get a state trooper fired who was feuding with her family after a messy divorce. There is the problem of her record. Opposition researchers and teams of reporters are combing through little-known details of Alaskan politics. They are turning up gems, such as Palin and her husband's apparent sympathy with the Alaska Independence party, an obscure group that wants Alaska to break away from the US. Her husband was once a member and she spoke at the party's convention in 2006. There are a lot of questions over her time as mayor of Wasilla (pop. 9,000). Palin is now running against so-called 'pork barrel' spending where pet projects are paid for by lobbying in Washington. Yet Wasilla seemed to do very well for itself under her rule, hiring its first Washington lobbyist and netting $27m. That is a sum cities 20 times bigger struggled to match. </p> <p>There is likely to be little let-up in such stories. In the era of cable news, blogging and YouTube, nothing remains secret for long. Campaigns can do little but weather the storms. 'We have lost control of the message,' admitted Mark McKinnon, a former communications aide to McCain and Bush. The media's - and the country's - obsession with Palin will now only grow. On her first post-convention campaign stop, Palin and McCain continued their small-town America theme. They headed for Cedarburg in Wisconsin. Thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Palin (and, perhaps, McCain too). 'This turnout in Cedarburg is what our campaign is all about. We're going to go all across the small towns of America,' McCain told the crowd. That sounds like a good plan, but, with Palin still such a little explored commodity, McCain should be a little careful with what he wishes for. </p> <p>But there is little doubt that the Obama campaign has been genuinely thrown by Palin's meteoric appearance on the political scene. Just as the Democrats were finishing their elaborately staged reconciliation with Clinton's former supporters, the Republicans have made a bold pitch for women voters.</p> <p>That makes defeating Palin a difficult issue. Obama's campaign cannot afford any semblance of sexism. One cartoon, published in the Detroit News, showed the dilemma. It had Clinton forlornly looking up from below a glass ceiling on top of which Palin was now confidently striding, like Jesus walking on water. 'Damn' was the simple thought bubble emerging from Clinton's head.</p> <p>The Democrats have shied away so far from any direct criticism of Palin. Instead they have kept their focus on McCain, trying continually to link him to George Bush and the policies of the past eight years. It was remarkable how small a role Bush played at the convention. He delivered a brief speech via video link and was barely mentioned. Vice-President Dick Cheney got even less attention. That showed how nervous Republicans were about inheriting the public dislike of the Bush legacy. Thus it also becomes possibly the most fruitful line of attack.</p> <p>Yet Palin upsets that plan. Unlike McCain, she cannot be readily linked to Bush or Washington. She barely knows either. Instead Democrats are hoping that her dyed-in-the-wool conservatism will overshadow the simple fact of her gender. Many experts believe centrist women voters, attracted by her strides for women, will be equally put off by her extremist politics. What has been so pleasing to the Republican base might not be acceptable to much of mainstream America. 'It does work with Republican activists. But you need more votes than that to win an election,' said Sabato.</p> <p>Palin has expressed support for teaching creationist theories alongside evolution in schools. She has seemed sympathetic to the idea of banning certain books in libraries. She is against abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. These values are not the current concerns of suburban America. The country's 'hockey moms' are far more likely to be worried about their falling house prices, the slowing economy and the war in Iraq than issues of conservative ideology.</p> <p>The spearhead of Obama's pushback against Palin is going to be Clinton. Obama's former rival is being dispatched to the key battleground state of Florida tomorrow to make her first campaign stop post-Denver. She is set to deliver a stinging rebuke to some of the points Palin has been making. At the same time a rapid response team of senior women Democrats is going to be deployed elsewhere, also taking up the mantle of pushing home the message that Palin and McCain are simply an extension of the Bush years. The women involved include Arizona governor Janet Napolitano and Kansas governor Kathleen Sibelius. </p> <p>Who will win this area of the election is simply impossible to tell, not least because the Republicans and Democrats are in effect running two different races. Democrats are betting that rock-solid issues will decide this election. Obama's prime-time speech was laden with policy detail. The Democrats have plans to create universal healthcare, change course on Iraq and increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans. The Republicans are making the opposite bet. They believe stirring personal narratives - such as McCain's war record and Palin's working mother ethos - will decide this election. They are betting that voters are looking for people to vote for, not policies. As McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davies, openly confessed last week: 'This election is not about issues.' Only time will tell which approach is right. </p> <p>One thing is certain: Palin has shaken up the race in ways no one could have foreseen even a week ago. Nothing about her seems conventional. Even the short biographical film used to introduce her to delegates in St Paul began with the bizarre words 'mother, moose-hunter, maverick'. She has risen so far so quickly that she has already been plastered on the cover of the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer with allegations (roundly denied) of an extramarital affair. She's even got her own 'pastor problem', echoing the travails of Obama and the Rev Jeremiah Wright. Palin once attended a church in Alaska whose pastor, Ed Kalnins, has preached that critics of Bush might go to hell. It is things like that which have the Republicans keeping Palin from any but the most media-controlled setting. The campaign is refusing interview requests for her: she will appear publicly at campaign rallies and that is it. This weekend McCain, Obama and his running mate, Joe Biden, are all hitting the Sunday morning talk-show circuit. Palin is not. That cannot last: she will have to come out into the open. Only then will small-town America make its full judgment.</p> <p>Back in Northfield, Minnesota, that was certainly the view of Sandy Molkenbur, as she leaned on her broom in front of the flower shop. Palin, she said, would have to obey the laws of politics just like everyone else. 'Right now she's the darling. But she's got the debates coming, against Joe Biden. That is not going to be easy,' she said. Then Molkenbur resumed sweeping the floor.</p>",
  "<p>Stand-alone insurance against airlines going bankrupt will be available to the British public for the first time next week.</p> <p>International Passenger Protection, a company that offers financial failure insurances to the travel industry, will be offering consumers cover - from \u00a35 for 30-day protection - via its website, <a href=\"http://www.protectmyholiday.com\">protectmyholiday.com</a>. The insurance will cover the cost of the defunct flight if an airline goes into administration before the policyholder's holiday starts, or the cost of replacement flights with another airline if it goes bust after departure. </p> <p>An estimated 40,000 passengers are out of pocket after the collapse of low-cost transatlantic airline Zoom 10 days ago. Its founders, John and Hugh Boyle, urged passengers to claim compensation from travel agents, insurance companies and credit card protection schemes. Yet many people did not buy their flights from travel agents and so have no protection, while only around one in 10 travel insurance policies offers protection for an airline collapsing. </p> <p>Paying by credit card offers some protection, but will only cover the value of the ticket if it is over \u00a3100; extra costs such as replacement flights or hotels are not covered. </p> <p>Twenty-four airlines have already collapsed this year and financial analysts warn Zoom is unlikely to be the last. The airline's founders blamed 'the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate', factors affecting every other airline. </p> <p>'It's inevitable more airlines will fail, especially with fuel prices as they are and the number of new carriers competing for business,' says James Freemantle, industry affairs manager at the Airport Transport Users Council. 'It's more pressing than ever for the government to look at passing legislation protecting people from airlines going bust.' </p> <p>So what can you do to protect yourself from a travel disaster? </p> <p><strong>On a package holiday</strong></p> <p>You are unlikely to need to take any extra measures against airline collapse. The Civil Aviation Authority runs a scheme called Atol that provides financial protection for those buying their flight as part of a package, even if they have only put down a deposit. See <a href=\"http://www.atol.org.uk\">www.atol.org.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Buying flights only </strong></p> <p>Confusing rules apply, leading many wrongly to think they are covered. If you buy your ticket directly from an airline, your money isn't protected if that airline fails. If you buy from a travel agent and get your ticket within 24 hours, your money is also not protected. But if the agent takes longer than this to get you your ticket it must provide you with a document either showing that it has arranged airline failure insurance and has added this cost to the fare - typically about \u00a33 - or that it hasn't arranged any cover and you are not protected. </p> <p><strong>Travel insurance</strong></p> <p>Many people imagine, again wrongly, that they are covered by their travel insurance policy in the event of an airline collapse. In reality, few insurers include airline failure insurance in their cover because it adds to the premium and makes them appear less competitive. The Post Office is one of the few to include the cover as standard in its annual policies. It offers up to \u00a31,500 cover, but its travel insurance policies are not the cheapest. For annual worldwide cover for someone under 65 it charges \u00a367.50. This compares unfavourably with Swiftcover, which offers \u00a33,000 of airline failure insurance as an add-on to its policy at the cost of \u00a31 for single trip insurance and \u00a33 for an annual policy. Its annual policy for the same person works out at \u00a345 with airline failure cover. </p> <p>A survey of 10 providers by price comparison website Gocompare.com found only one, Travelplan Direct, that covered airline failure; its premium for the same person is \u00a342. </p> <p>'If you're not covered by the Atol protection scheme, it's worthwhile weighing up what the chances are of your airline having financial problems,' says Hayley Parsons of Gocompare.com. 'If you're flying with an airline such as British Airways it's highly unlikely you'll have any worries, but if you've booked with a smaller and perhaps less well-established airline then the extra protection of airline failure cover could be worth it.'</p> <p>If the airline goes bust before you fly, the policies cover travel and accommodation costs paid in advance, as long as they do not form part of an inclusive holiday. After departure, the policies cover the cost of replacing the original flights with similar ones from another airline, or if cutting the holiday short is unavoidable, the cost of earlier return flights to the UK.

  "<p>Oprah Winfrey, America's favourite daytime TV star, has refused to have Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin as a guest on her talk show.</p> <p>Winfrey, a prominent supporter of Democratic nominee Barack Obama, has been facing pressure from conservative commentators and pundits who say that Palin would be a perfect interview for her female-heavy audience.</p> <p>Such an appearance would be a huge coup for the John McCain campaign. Palin, the party's first female vice-presidential choice, is making a determined bid for women voters and frequently refers to herself as a 'hockey mom' who just happened to fall into politics.</p> <p>But Winfrey, responding to rumours on conservative websites like the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/\">Drudge Report</a> that her staff was divided on the issue, squashed the idea of an interview. 'When I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates,' she said in a statement.</p> <p>Some experts believe the issue, initially reported on Drudge - which first gained notoriety when it broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal - was a media ploy to drag Winfrey's backing of Obama into the election and show a media bias against the Republicans. But Winfrey's statement slammed reports on Drudge that there was a fierce debate going on among her staff about having Palin on as a guest. Winfrey called the story 'categorically untrue' and said there had been no discussion about having Palin on during the election.</p> <p>'I agree that Sarah Palin would be a fantastic interview, and I would love to have her on after the campaign is over,' Winfrey said.</p> <p>The issue shows the potential danger in Winfrey's open support for Obama, especially as he was a guest on her show several times before she came out in favour of his candidacy. It also now plays into a current Republican strategy of attacking the media as biased against their party. The story also shows the many unpredictable ways that Palin has already shaken up the presidential election. Her sex and modest family background has opened up a whole new demographic appeal for the McCain campaign which is now aggressively courting suburban and small-town American women - who are exactly Winfrey's audience.</p> <p>But her selection also has risks. Palin is a little-known political quantity and there has already been a flood of stories about her private and political life as governor of Alaska. She is also waging a ferocious legal campaign to block a bipartisan state investigation into claims she pursued a personal vendetta against a former family member. The dispute, inevitably called 'Troopergate', threatens to dog Palin as she hits the campaign trail. The complex case is looking at allegations that she dismissed the head of the Alaskan police service, safety commissioner Walt Monegan, because he refused to bow to pressure and sack Palin's former brother-in-law from the police force.</p> <p>Trooper Mike Wooten was involved in an acrimonious divorce from Palin's sister before the governor took up her post. Palin denies any impropriety, though she has acknowledged that more than 20 approaches were made to the commissioner by her husband Todd and her closest aides urging him to take disciplinary action against Wooten.</p> <p>Last week she appointed a private lawyer to represent her interests. Thomas Van Flein is an Anchorage attorney with a tough reputation who specialises in employment law. He has moved swiftly to put spokes in the wheel of Stephen Branchflower, a former state prosecutor appointed by the legislature to conduct the investigation. Seven key witnesses who had previously agreed to co-operate with Branchflower have now retracted the offer. Two other witnesses were last week interviewed by Van Flein - a spoiling technique that for legal reasons could make it more difficult for Branchflower to quiz them.</p> <p>As Palin's lawyer fights aggressively to contain one forest fire, another appears to be flaring up. New allegations have surfaced that potentially criminal acts were committed in snooping into Wooten's personal employment files. A taped telephone conversation between one of Palin's staff and a senior manager in the police department, in which complaints were made about Wooten, suggested that he had lied on an official form claiming compensation for injury at work. Wooten's union, the Public Safety Employees Association, has issued its own legal proceedings that allege such information could only have been obtained in breach of the trooper's right to confidentiality - a potential crime.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma</strong> I have a 21-year-old daughter who I believe is in a relationship with a 60-year-old man. It's been going on since she was around 17, when she began babysitting for his children. When I ask her about it, she flatly denies it, but she is an attractive girl who has never shown any interest in guys her own age, and she lies to me about where she is going. We have had a troubled relationship for a number of years, although she's still living at home. I split up from her father five years ago and although I have a reasonably amicable relationship with him, my daughter does not. He's in a new relationship and chooses to believe what he wants; he points out that she's off his hands now she is over 18. I am fed up with her lying to me, but she is my child and I want the best for her. Should I confront her with her father there, too? Should I speak to the man she is having the relationship with? I don't know what to do.</p> <p><strong> Mariella:</strong> I'm not really sure what your goal here is - and I'm fairly certain that you're equally in the dark. Is your intention to get her to end the relationship, to encourage her to confide in you in order to improve the relationship between you, or to have a family showdown? Your husband may not be all you hoped for, but he's certainly got a point. </p> <p>Your child is now an adult and any jot of juristic control that you once had over her comings and goings and general choices in life is no longer in effect. That said, she has chosen to remain under your roof and if your intention is to force her to end the affair, then I suppose that is your one trump card. Having not sought an independent lifestyle, she has to some extent forfeited her rights to one, and could potentially be pressed to disclosure under threat of eviction. </p> <p>But what exactly would that achieve? Either she would depart your house in unpleasant circumstances or you'd force an admission which you would still be powerless to act on. You say that it is her lying to you that's responsible for the barrier between you, but I'd hazard a guess that your controlling, judgmental tendencies may also have something to do with it. Not to mention the effect of a nagging concern that your divorce may have been a contributing factor to her relationship choice. </p> <p>I understand and sympathise. It's not the relationship you would want your young daughter to be having, but if you want to improve your own dealings with her, you're going to have to start showing an interest in her point of view. If she is having an affair with this older guy, it's unlikely to be coincidence that it began within a year of her parents' separation. </p> <p>She may well feel utterly rejected by her father and therefore have found what to her seems an ideal replacement. I presume that this is something you've given some thought to? At an insecure period in her life, around the time she was finishing school, another cataclysmic event took place when you and her father decided to separate. </p> <p>I'm not blaming this on the demise of your marriage - a sad scenario that many people face - merely suggesting that there may be a connection between the departure of her father and her embrace of a father figure. It will also have contributed to her feelings of low self-esteem, which also explains why she is lingering at home despite the fractious relationship with you. Her feelings of low self-worth will only be exacerbated by your antagonistic approach to her relationship. What incentive is there to confide in you when she already knows that you disapprove wholeheartedly and want to force her to end the affair? </p> <p>Applying a less judgmental and more sympathetic approach would go a long way to achieving your goal. I suggest you gently encourage her to open up by beginning conversations about unrelated matters, in the long run letting her make a positive choice to disclose rather than confessing as the result of coercion. You'll need an understanding ear and a large dollop of patience. It may take time but, quite honestly, it's the only way to move this situation forward. </p> <p>Your daughter will not end the affair just because you disapprove. You can be sure that this affair certainly won't last. Make it your goal to become her shoulder to cry on by the time it reaches its inevitable conclusion. Prolonging your aggressively opposing position will only ensure she carries on, just to spite you. </p> <p>My suggestion is that you try an altogether more holistic approach that includes, despite any resentment you might harbour, improving her relationship with her father. You need to examine all the contributing factors in order to understand why a seemingly mature and (to her) rich sugar daddy might appear an appealing option. By focusing on your daughter's point of view you may begin to understand her and in the process ensure that you become in future, the first person she turns to, rather than the last!</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> If you, too, have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats are facing an embarrassing High Court battle with a lawyer who says that the party wrongly accepted \u00a3632,000 of his money as part of a donation. Robert Mann, 60, claims that the party failed to carry out adequate checks on the money which was received as part of a \u00a32.4m gift from the financier Michael Brown. </p> <p>Money was handed to Brown as part of an investment opportunity, according to Mann. Brown's gift was used to bankroll the party's 2005 general election campaign in which the Lib Dems won a record number of seats. </p> <p>On Thursday, Mann's solicitors at the City fraud specialists Bivonas advised the party that a writ will be placed before the Royal Courts of Justice this week demanding the return of the money. It follows an exchange of legal letters last month seen by this newspaper. </p> <p>The claim will provoke more soul searching among party members just days before its annual conference. Some of the party's peers have previously called for Brown's donation to be returned.</p> <p>Brown, 42, is currently wanted by police after going on the run while awaiting a multimillion-pound fraud trial. The trial is due to take place later this month in his absence. </p> <p>Mann, a Harvard-educated lawyer from Los Angeles, said that the Lib Dems failed to make adequate checks on Brown or the money and have since snubbed his pleas for its return. </p> <p>'I am shocked that the Liberal Democrats, who run on a platform of total political accountability, would even consider not returning the funds,' he said. 'They have been on notice of this fact for several years. To continuously try to make excuses to avoid this responsibility is not the actions of an honourable political party. </p> <p>'The voters in England should consider such conduct when they select their next political representatives. I am hopeful that the powers within the Liberal Democrats will decide to do the right thing both for me and the honour of Britain.' </p> <p>Mann, an experienced player in capital markets, invested $5m with Brown's company, 5th Avenue Partners, in February 2005 as part of an investment scheme. The money was paid into a US company account controlled by Brown. A month later $1.1m - \u00a3632,000 - was transferred into the Liberal Democrat campaign fund. </p> <p>Brown, a Glasgow-born businessman whose home is in Majorca, appeared from nowhere when he approached the Liberal Democrats in December 2004 asking if they needed a donation. </p> <p>After providing the party with the biggest donation in its history, he flew in a private plane with then leader Charles Kennedy and dined with grandees. </p> <p>He gave the donation in two tranches, in February and March 2005, which the party claims was spent on poster and advertising campaigns. </p> <p>By September that year, questions were being asked about whether the donation was permissible by law because Brown did not live in Britain and was not registered to vote. Critics claimed that the Lib Dems should not have accepted the money because 5th Avenue Partners showed little evidence of trading in Britain. </p> <p>The Electoral Commission, the donations watchdog, launched an inquiry into the donation later that month. The body can take the donation into the public purse if it is found that it is not permissible. However, the commission's inquiry was suspended after police began to look into Brown and his companies.</p> <p>Brown absconded this summer while facing 18 charges including money laundering, theft and perverting the course of justice. Neighbours from his Hampstead flat said that in the weeks before he disappeared he had changed his appearance by growing a full beard and began to use the surname 'Campbell-Brown' after changing his registered name on the electoral roll. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats insist that they have now spent the money given to them by Brown, and that they accepted it in good faith after checking that the donation was permissible in law. </p> <p>A Liberal Democrat official confirmed that the party had received notification from Mann's solicitors that the money will be pursued this week through the High Court. A party spokesman said: 'All our donations from 5th Avenue Partners were received in good faith and were properly spent on the general election campaign. Our auditors have seen our legal advice on this matter and confirmed that we do not need to make provision in relation to this matter.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>What she watched:</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiona's story</strong> BBC1</p> <p><strong>The children </strong>ITV1</p> <p><strong>Lost in Austen</strong> ITV1</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for... Last week I wrote about wanting to see drama that was 'brave and moving, sumptuously-lovely-to-look-at and utterly escapist...' and lo, it came to pass, though not all in the same programme, obviously. </p> <p>On Sunday night, which is traditionally feel-good night on the grounds that the journey to work on Monday is arguably better with a spring in one's step rather than a helpline number in one's pocket, ITV1 had a feel-good banker with episode 93 of Heartbeat's 56th series (these figures may be accurate or may just feel that way), followed by Martin Clunes and his dogs, BBC1 bravely offered up 90 minutes in which Fiona (Gina McKee) and Simon (Jeremy Northam) underwent a very middle-class, restrained and stiff-upper-lip sort of marital breakdown when Simon was busted for using his credit card to download child pornography. </p> <p>As <strong>Fiona's Story</strong>'s Fiona, a full-time mother of three daughters in a marriage which appeared to have run its course even before it imploded, McKee - a wonderful actor who conveys characters' subtleties with whispers, tiny shrugs and twitches, sighs and eyes - was spectacularly unspectacular, which is a compliment, because if ever a subject appeared to demand histrionics of the plate-throwing, door-slamming variety it was one in which everything the central character thought they knew about their life partner was undone in an instant by a knock on the door from the police when the kids were in bed. </p> <p>Northam was equally good. Even if it's always all about 'the work', any actor is going to wonder if playing a narcissistic, manipulative, self-righteous excuse for a real man is going to be a smart career move, but perhaps the writing persuaded him. Kate Gabriel's script made Simon entirely plausible - occasionally all too terrifyingly so. </p> <p>'I didn't do it, Fi - it wasn't me. You can trust me on this,' eventually became, 'I feel kind of happy. No, not happy - better. Now these things are out in the open I can really be me...' </p> <p>That Simon was an emotional lost cause for Fiona, as well as simply lost, was beautifully illustrated in the scene in which she told him, 'I can't sleep with you ever again. It's over.' To which his tragicomically inappropriate response was, 'Is there someone else?' </p> <p>So Fiona was better off without Simon and Simon appeared to be better off without Fiona, what with the new 26-year-old girlfriend ('Does she know?' wondered Fiona. 'Doesn't think it's a big deal...' explained Simon with a dismissive shrug) and his blithe flouting of the post-marital rules of engagement, inviting his daughters' friends for sleepovers while Fiona skulk-stalked powerlessly outside his house in her car, alive to imagined dangers, before returning to her big house, full of empty children's beds. I may not be in Fiona's position but, none the less, with a couple of empty beds upstairs I found myself pointlessly plumping cushions and rearranging teddies when the film finished. </p> <p>The ending was a bit too neat and glib. After many months on bail Simon wasn't charged because nothing incriminating was found on his computers, though we knew he had destroyed the one on which there was. In Simon's eyes this made him innocent, but Fiona knew ('and you know that I know...'), though this didn't stop her going back to a future which included choir practice with Jimi Mistry. For any single women who are not in imminent danger of being seduced by the delectable Mistry, it felt as though Fiona only got him because the rest of us never would - generous of Kate Gabriel, but it also rather undermined the potent plausibility of the rest of her drama, which, as the credits rolled, offered a helpline number which presumably didn't go straight to Mistry's voicemail. </p> <p>In contrast to Fiona's Story, in which the children were always adjacent to but never in the middle of the action, ITV1's <strong>The Children</strong> (and the clue is in the title) put them squarely at the centre. </p> <p>This is a three-part thriller and a murder mystery - we knew that a little girl was dead from the start, and the story unfolds in flashback - but is, wittingly or otherwise, also an indictment of the sort of messy modern parenting in which step-parents and step-siblings, new babies and would-be partners are twisted and reconfigured like so many Rubik's Cubes. </p> <p>Kevin Whately is head teacher Cameron who, since the break-up of his marriage to Anne (Lesley Sharp), lives with new girlfriend Sue (Geraldine Somerville) and her eight-year-old daughter Emily, whose own father is distracted by a new baby with his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Cameron's son, 14-year-old Jack, drifts resentfully between his mother and father. </p> <p>The adults are all so focused on their personal gratification that their children are in danger of slipping under the radar. They wait to be picked up at school gates, twiddle their thumbs while parents make phone calls, and turn their backs, seethe quietly with unarticulated hurts and resentments when every adult is consumed by their own. It is mundane and horrible and reflects the lives of many, so we are both sympathetic and appalled when we discover that Jack's mum spends her evenings necking sambucas in nightclubs with her younger colleagues while her son roams the streets, but we understand how it came to pass. </p> <p>Though Kevin Whately is the star and the children (beautifully played, particularly by Freddie Boath as Jack, in his TV debut, and whose only 'fault' is that he looks every rangy inch the 17-year-old he really is) are the emotional epicentre, it is the reliably fabulous Lesley Sharp who, as with every part she plays, puts soft and easily bruisable flesh on her brittle character's bones, making her achingly human and empathetic. </p> <p>This is guilt-trip telly. It will make parents creep upstairs to sit on beds and rearrange teddies, stroke small cheeks and check the breathing of tiny babies. It is timely and very well written (by Lucy Gannon, who is extremely good at messy families), and I suspect the thriller aspect will grip to the end, but there's something that lies beneath the excellent performances and the way-we-live-now-ness of it all which feels uncomfortably too much as if it is pandering to one's baser instincts. </p> <p>There was, for example, a moment after Emily's body was found when a police officer turned to his colleague and asked: 'When's the family liaison turning up?' which was immediately punctuated by a howled 'Noooooooooooooooo!' from inside the house and a knowing look from the officer. It was wrong - a cymbal-crashing ta-da of a dramatic moment which felt cheap, lazy and unnecessarily manipulative. The Children is quite compelling enough without the addition of what amounted to a slightly sick little writerly joke. Not that that will stop me watching next week. </p> <p>Even a TV critic can hit the wall. I wanted to watch BBC2s God on Trial, I really did, and I tried, but after child abuse and child murder I just couldn't take more than 10 minutes of the Holocaust, not last week. (Thank God for iPlayer.) But the guilt, the guilt... if God on Trial was a critic's 'must-see', then ITV1's <strong>Lost in Austen </strong>was only a 'probably-ought-to-see'. </p> <p>I didn't mind the premise - Jane Austen fan Amanda Price (Jemima Rooper) slips not only back in time, but sideways, into fiction and specifically the plot of Pride and Prejudice, which she then proceeds to inadvertently disrupt despite wanting the correct happy ending - even though it was girly and twee (despite being written by a man). Fortunately it was nowhere near as wide-eyed and faux-na\u00eff as, say, Pushing Daisies, and it made me giggle - Amanda's sudden appearance ('from Hammersmith') in the Bennet household, wearing what she described to her bemused hosts as 'otter-hunting kit', was pleasingly bonkers, as was Mr Bennet's (Hugh Bonneville, clearly enjoying himself) subsequent observation to Mrs B that, meanwhile, 'Lizzie is disporting herself in the otter-strewn thoroughfares of Hammersmith...' </p> <p>With her lippy, fags, lack of skill on the dancefloor, a daring snog with Mr Bingley and noting that Mr Darcy was 'not Colin Firth. But even Colin Firth isn't Colin Firth - they had to change the shape of his head with make-up', Amanda is a likeably feisty modern single girl in possession of a (comparatively) small fortune and in want of a life... but what of Gemma Arterton's Elizabeth Bennet, currently lost not only in Hammersmith but presumably in translation too? Could Lost in Austen's budget run to a walk-on for Colin Firth, with or without the correctly shaped head, or will Lizzie end up begging outside Hammersmith tube, homeless and alone, but for her crack pipe?</p> <h2>Crash test - but no dummies</h2> <p>Apparently there have been 52,000 fewer applications for provisional driving licences this year than there were during the same period in 2007, which means those 17-year-olds who do apply are probably more likely to be taught by parents, which made BBC3's <strong>Driving Mum and Dad Mad</strong> very timely. Watching teenagers Verity and Joe compete to pass their tests and win a Corsa in just three weeks by veering into hedges and throwing strops was very funny, but it was the bittersweet conflicts between parent-teachers and pupil-kids which made it so watchable. </p> <p>Joe was straight on to busy roads with his macho dad ('Joe's gay. I'm not...'), while Verity and her saintly mum spent several days stalling in car parks. Relations inevitably broke down, while the power struggles had everything to do with control but not much to do with clutches. In the end, Verity won the prize but Joe learned the bigger life lessons. It was all surprisingly touching.</p>",
  "<p>Sauvignon blanc is an extremely popular variety making crisp, dry, aromatic and very distinctive wines all over the world, excelling in cooler climates. Many people favour its crisp acidity over the soft butteriness of a lot of chardonnays. The smell is sharp (unlike that of chardonnay) and reminds different tasters variously of gooseberries, nettles, crushed blackcurrant leaves and occasionally tomcats (yes, it has been likened to the smell of cat's pee). With age, aromas reminiscent of canned asparagus can develop.</p> <p>The smell of sauvignon (which is most of its character) is relatively simple, and it smells and tastes remarkably similar wherever it is planted. So, like gewurztramine, it is a very good starting point for learning to recognise different varieties. Some sauvignon blanc can last for several years in bottle, but very little actually improves - vibrant young fruitiness with refreshment value, rather than subtlety, is sauvignon's strong suit. </p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Sauvignon blanc's French stronghold is the upper Loire, in particular the twin appellations of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. It is here that sauvignon is found in its purest form. The best examples of these wines are drier, denser and slower-maturing than most new world sauvignon blanc, and the best genuinely express terroir with nuances dependent on the proportion of gravel and flint in the soil. Sauvignon is also grown widely downstream, notably to produce oceans of sauvignon de Touraine which, from the bestproducers, can be good value - as can the Sancerre-like wines of less famous Menetou-Salon, Reuilly and Quincy. </p> <p>Sauvignon is even more widely planted in Bordeaux and Bergerac, although it is less important here than the fatter semillon with which it is commonly blended - as elsewhere - to produce both dry wines (particularly in Pessac-L\u00e9ognan, Graves and Entre-Deux-Mers) and sweet (in Sauternes, Monbazillac and surrounds). Sauvignon supplies the aroma and acidity in greater Bordeaux's whites, and the more expensive dry wines are often aged in small oak barrels. Sauvignon and oak can be an oily mixture unless managed with a very deft hand.</p> <h2>New Zealand</h2> <p>Sauvignon blanc overtook chardonnay in New Zealand in 2003, and this relatively tiny wine industry can boast twice as much sauvignon as Australia and significantly more than either the Loire or Bordeaux. New Zealand has been so successful with its pungently herbaceous style of sauvignon blanc, heady with the tropical fruit smells of a cool, prolonged fermentation, that winemakers throughout the new and old world, especially in Chile, South Africa and the Languedoc, are now emulating it. In some vintages, fruit is deliberately picked underripe, ripe and overripe to bring different characteristics to the final blend. Marlborough, at the north end of the South Island, is New Zealand's, possibly now the world's, sauvignon capital. </p> <h2>Chile</h2> <p>Casablanca and San Antonio valleys, close to the Pacific coast, may have the potential to do the same job for Chile. Two of the coolest and newest wine regions in Chile, they are the only ones to be planted substantially with sauvignon blanc rather than the less distinctive sauvignonasse. The majority of vines originally called sauvignon by the Chileans are very likely sauvignonasse, or sauvignon vert, and occasionally sauvignon gris, rather than sauvignon blanc. </p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>In Europe, sauvignon is a speciality of Rueda in Spain, Styria in Austria and Collio in north-east Italy. Some German speakers call it muskat-silvaner. South Africa makes some delicious sauvignon blanc, perhaps because the vine has had so long to accustom itself to local conditions (it was widely planted there in the 19th century). Much of Australia is too warm for the preservation of sauvignon blanc's characteristically \"green\" (ie slightly underripe) aroma, but some fine examples have emerged from the Adelaide Hills. Sauvignon blanc has enjoyed enormous success in California since the 1980s. The state generally produces a distinct, full-bodied, often oak-aged version, and the variety has also sparkled in Texas and Washington.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Radcliffe's Sauvignon Blanc</strong><br><strong>Haut-Poitou 2007, VDQS France \u00a37.49, or \u00a34.99 on the 3 for 2 <br>deal, Threshers</strong><br> This has all the hallmarks of a Loire sauvignon blanc - the fresh-mown grass scent, nettley green notes and mountain stream freshness - but it's from a VDQS (a quality level between AOC and vin de pays) just to the south of <br>the great river, so commands a lower price. </p> <p><strong>One to lust after</strong><br> <br><strong>Blind River 2007 Marlborough, New Zealand</strong> <br><strong>\u00a310.99, Oddbins</strong><br> <br>Boisterous, full of itself and with a smell of passion fruit and ripe melons, there is no mistaking the origin of this high-impact sauvignon blanc. A tiny proportion of the wine is fermented in French oak - barely noticeable, but it adds a layer of texture, softens the edges and gives it a broader mouthfeel.<br><strong>Victoria Moore</strong> </p> <h2>Background</h2> <p><strong>Say it right</strong> Saw-vee-nyon blonk </p> <p><strong>Makes</strong> crisp, pale and pungent wines, rarely oaked </p> <p><strong>Hotspots</strong> Loire in France, Marlborough in New Zealand </p> <p><strong>Good companions</strong> Sauvignon and semillon together produce dry as well as sweet wines </p> <p><strong>Legends</strong> Sancerre and Pouilly-Fume AOCs in France; producers Montana and Cloudy Bay in NZ </p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> Sauvignon's status went up in the world when, in 1997, DNA testing revealed it is the parent, with cabernet franc, of cabernet sauvignon. Known in Pouilly-sur-Loire (the centre of the Pouilly-Fume appellation) as blanc fume, it was, in the 1970s, renamed fume blanc by Californian producer Robert Mondavi - a piece of marketing that has become part of the wine vernacular to denote an oaked-style sauvignon </p> <p><strong>If you like</strong> sauvignon blanc, try muscat</p> <h2>Drink with</h2> <p>Spring's ingredients are made for sauvignon blanc . But while all manner of variations on broad beans, peas, mint, basil, lemon, sea salt and really good, peppery olive oil are perfectly suited, it is good old goat's cheese that creates the best match. It's an incredible marriage. Two ingredients, one crisp and angular, the other pasty and chalk-like: together they seem disarmed , the hard edges smoothed out. Avoid goat's cheese rolled in ash or, worse, pepper and generally keep a lookout for the young, fresher examples.<br><strong>Matt Skinner </strong></p> <p><em>Wine is one of the most civilised things in the world and one of the most natural things of the world that has been brought to the greatest perfection </em><br><strong>Ernest Hemingway, Death in the Afternoon</strong></p>",
  "<p>The last time I stayed in a guesthouse in the UK, it was remarkable only for the fact that it was painted pink. The first guesthouse I visited in India was in the pink-painted city of Jaipur. Fortunately, the similarities ended there.</p> <p>Whereas Dreary-on-Sea featured a slightly camp host with all-too unique design skills and accommodation that exuded defeat, the Jaipur flagship of a new wave of Indian B&amp;Bs offered a glimpse of a world no ordinary hotel chain could hope to provide.</p> <p>We are sitting on wicker chairs in a small, open-sided structure at the edge of an immaculate lawn as dusk falls. What appears to be a one-legged bird is hopping clumsily across the grass, pecking industriously at the grass. Away to the east, the elephants that plough up and down the shore of the lake that surrounds the Jai Mahal palace are nearing the end of their working day. As the light fails, the city - originally painted yellow, but now repainted a deep, almost orange shade of pink - glows in the twilight.</p> <p>The lawn is bounded on two sides by the balconied wings of an imposing, beautifully decorated house, the Madhu Pushp Bhawan. Overhead, a fan is throwing mosquitoes off course.</p> <p>We are in the state of Rajasthan, which the Rough Guide warns is notoriously unwelcoming to drinkers, yet the remains of a bottle of chilled Kingfisher beer stands on the table.

The house is one of a growing chain run by the powerful Mahindra family, which also makes cars and owns a bank. It offers home stays which combine, according to the company, 'the comfort and distinction of a boutique hotel with the personal hospitality, informality and local knowledge enjoyed when staying with family friends'.</p> <p>The big selling point is the insight into Indian family life. Some people just visit the Chauhans for the afternoon, to take tea or dinner with the family, crowding into the kitchen to watch Mr Chauhan's wife, Bushbendra, and her daughter-in-law, Madhu, work their magic with spices and to pepper them with questions; others stay the night in one of the seven guest bedrooms.</p> <p>Inside, the wings head off from a vast main room. An open door reveals Jaideep's eight-year-old son sprawled on a bed watching television, while the head of a rather startled tiger pokes out from the wall above the family prayer room. 'Shot by my grandfather sometime before 1920,' Chauhan senior explains. The rooms are furnished exquisitely, finely carved furniture vying with delicate pieces of silver.</p> <p>Dinner is served upstairs. Jaideep sits across from me while Madhu hovers. She prefers to eat a little later, but sits anyway and takes a bowl of dal. Parathas arrive, warm and flaky. I watch carefully to see what order Jaideep takes the food in (a day earlier, I disgraced myself in a Delhi restaurant by dipping my bread into a bowl of tapioca which was meant to be the dessert element of a thali). After dinner, I retire to a room that is not extravagantly furnished but is on the right side of comfortable. I cannot find a top sheet, but the room is warm and I can't be bothered to disturb anyone to find me one. </p> <p>I lie down and start to fall asleep, only to be woken by an icy blast from the air-conditioning unit. I reset it, switch off the light - and 20 minutes later I'm blasted again. I give up, switch it off and opt for the ceiling fan, which does an admirable and remarkably silent job. It is my only real grumble. Oddly, in a hotel this would have driven me crazy. I would have been on the phone, demanding to move rooms. But here it would have seemed bad manners, like staying at a friend's house and asking to swap bedrooms because you didn't like the colour of the wallpaper. </p> <p>Mahindra has been signing up guesthouses across India; from havellis (large houses with an enclosed courtyard) in the north, to plantation mansions in the south. A week later, I sample what sort of experience they have to offer in the nation's capital. My taxi pulls up outside a rather unwelcoming gate in the lively (read noisy and polluted) Delhi suburb of South Extension II. A man in a vest shambles out. I'm about to tell the driver to forget it when we glean from Man A that we have found the back door.</p> <p>At the front, a slightly better attired gentleman eyes me cautiously and tells me he has no rooms. After some effort, we establish that I do indeed have a reservation and he shows me to an unprepossessing room with twin single beds. Someone has gone to fetch the owner. In the meantime, Man B stands in the doorway, trapping me in the room. I feel the urge to go home (not so far-fetched: I live about a 10-minute taxi ride away), but my escape is foiled by the owner, Sunil Saigal, who greets me with an outstretched hand. </p> <p>We sit down, I start to say hello and Man B interrupts to demand my passport. Then my name. Then my address in the UK. Then a signature.</p> <p>Mr Saigal shows me around and I note that everyone else has nicer rooms than I do. Downstairs, he explains that the guests come and go in the evenings but there is usually someone in the main living room. </p> <p>I seize the opportunity to escape for a few hours to take a stroll in the nearby Deer Park and the craft shops of Hauz Khas village, but it is apparently Lord Shiva's birthday and half of them are closed. Muttering darkly about this being just the sort of local knowledge the Mahindra hosts are supposed to have at their fingertips, I return to my room, eyeing the narrow single beds balefully and planning to hunker down until I can escape at dawn. I call my wife. 'Don't be stupid. Go out and see who is there. You'll enjoy it,' she tells me crossly.</p> <p>Reluctantly, I venture out. Mr Saigal is sitting in an armchair against the wall with a cigarette in one hand and a tumbler of whisky in the other. A bottle is fetched and a glass for me. More people appear, including a Norwegian woman dressed in a salwar kameez and Sunil's brother, Raman. Then Mrs Saigal - Rashmi - ambles in. At some point, a businessman arrives; he does something in television. More whisky appears. They are all lovely. I learn many things, then promptly forget them. If the idea is to give guests a flavour of the real India, it is working - the flavour is whisky.</p> <p>It is gone 1.30am when I grope blearily for the door handle and discover that I am physically incapable of forming letters on the page of my notebook. All I can remember is that at some point in the evening I agreed to buy a car. I have no idea what sort though, if pushed, I would guess that it was probably pink.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Mahindra Homestays currently has more than 50 properties in Delhi, and in the states of Rajasthan, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh, with plans to double the number on offer by the end of the year.

  "<p>On a sultry evening in Manhattan last month, Joseph O'Neill was to be found in the cool downtown atmosphere of the independent SoHo bookstore McNally Jackson. The occasion was a party thrown for the store's renaming (it had previously been called McNally Robinson), a champagne affair with a guest list and a doorman. A slew of hip young writers was present, but O'Neill, a trim, saturnine figure with the welcoming smile of someone familiar with anonymity, was the main attraction. In T-shirt, shorts and untied pumps, he looked like that most uncommon of urban creatures: a relaxed author. In front of him was a queue of readers - mostly young women - eager to gain his signature on their copies of his book, and all around him was the pleasing and unmistakable buzz of success.</p> <p>This is the celebrity version of the literary life: the fashionable event, the limelight, the approbation. But O'Neill, an Irishman of Turkish descent who grew up in Holland and went to university in England, is far more intimate with the other version: the long days and dark nights that form the basis of the creative process, and the quiet, frustrating obscurity of the unread author. His two previous novels, and a memoir, had slipped almost unnoticed into the bottomless void in which nearly all books sooner or later - and mostly sooner - come to reside.</p> <p>'I'd never met a disinterested third party who'd read my work,' he told me. But here, as at various readings he had attended in recent weeks, there was one big party of unknown readers lining up to tell him how much they loved his book. New York magazine had already declared O'Neill 'King of New York', and he was to be seen on video screens in the back of yellow cabs being interviewed about the cause of all the fanfare, his third novel, Netherland, the current favourite to win the Man Booker prize.</p> <p>Courtesy of his education at an international school in the Hague and Cambridge University (where he read law), O'Neill sounds like an impeccable Englishman. As if to complete the effect, he also worked until 1998 as a barrister in that most English of establishments, the Temple. Now 44, he has been living in New York for the past decade. Seven of those years he spent working on Netherland, ostensibly a slim novel concerning the small world of New York cricket. When eventually the book was finished, he was turned down by a number of agents and then, having secured an agent, he was rejected by every major New York publisher, except for one, Pantheon books. The imprint is part of the Random House empire overseen by Sonny Mehta, the great panjandrum of New York publishing, and it was O'Neill's good fortune that Mehta, a keen cricket fan, read the book and wrote a personal recommendation to booksellers.</p> <p>In any case, Netherland was greeted with extravagant praise by some of America's most influential critics. Writing in the New Yorker, James Wood called it 'one of the most remarkable post-colonial books I have ever read'. The New York Times hailed it as 'the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and most desolate work of fiction we've yet had about life in New York and London after the World Trade Center fell.'</p> <p>These were the kind of notices authors spend their bathtimes fantasising about. In Britain, critical acclaim tends to have a limited impact on sales, unless it comes from Richard and Judy. But in America, when Michiko Kakutani, of the New York Times, and James Wood rave about a book, it often provides a helpful nudge towards the bestseller list. 'I knew that I was at the tipping point,' O'Neill says. 'I knew that strangers would buy my book. That for me was a huge breakthrough. Members of your extended family are not the only ones who will read it.'</p> <p>In many respects, Netherland is an unlikely hit. First of all, any novel that describes the beauty of the square cut and cover drive does not scream out 'read me' to an American audience. As one of the characters says in the novel, 'There's a limit to what Americans understand. The limit is cricket.' Then there is the plot, which centres around a Dutch banker named Hans, his abandonment by his English wife Rachel, and his friendship with a shady Trinidadian entrepreneur called Chuck Ramkissoon. Nothing much happens in the story. The big event - Chuck's death, or rather, murder - takes place at the beginning, and thereafter the narrative meanders through Hans's troubled thoughts and his outsider's descriptions of New York.</p> <p>Yet it is a thoroughly absorbing book, not least because it grapples with the dislocated reality of 21st-century urban life, steeped in comfort and beset by fear, in which the internationally wealthy remain largely ignorant of, or indifferent to, the immigrant poor. As Hans ventures into Chuck's netherworld in the outer boroughs of New York, and learns of his scheme to introduce professional cricket to America, the Dutchman begins to see people and situations about which he previously knew nothing. Inevitably, Hans's attempt to grasp common bonds amid his emotional desolation is resonant of the wider search for community and identity that marked the anxious aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Hence, on top of its literary merits, the novel has been lauded for capturing the temper of the post-9/11 times. O'Neill acknowledges that his book arrived at just the right moment. 'It may be in tune with the zeitgeist,' he says. 'But you don't know that seven years before. One year earlier or later? If this book comes out after Obama, probably nobody cares.'</p> <p>O'Neill always wanted to be a writer. Such was his love of books that he decided not to read English at university, because literature was 'too precious to study - you want it to remain a hobby'. By the same token, he became a barrister, though not before taking a year off to write his first novel, This is the Life, about the travails of a young lawyer. 'Novel-writing is a bit like deception,' O'Neill has said. 'You lie as little as you possibly can. That's the way I do it, anyway.'</p> <p>In Netherland, Hans and his wife move into the Chelsea Hotel, the legendary bohemian refuge on West 23rd street, when they have to evacuate their Tribeca apartment after 9/11. With its cramped space and community of exiles and eccentrics, the hotel acts as a kind of idealised microcosm of Manhattan, an island unto itself. In reality, O'Neill also lives in the hotel with his wife, Sally Singer, a talented writer who is a senior editor at American Vogue, and their three young boys. The lobby, hall and staircase of the Chelsea is decorated with work by artists who live, or have lived, in the hotel. On the door of O'Neill's three-bedroom suite is an Obama sticker. Inside on the wall is a silkscreen multiple image of Sid Vicious, a former resident of the hotel who killed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen in a room downstairs.</p> <p>O'Neill met Singer back in 1991 when she was his American editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux. She turned down his second novel, though that did not prevent them from setting up home in Soho in London. Singer worked for the London Review of Books and then British Vogue, but she was tempted back to the States in 1998 by an offer from American Elle. In Manhattan's heated medialand she is a name to be reckoned with. It can't have been easy, being her seemingly non-productive other half.</p> <p>'Joe was never really interested in any of that stuff,' says Singer, a sharp-looking woman whose fascination with fashion in no way disguises her formidable intellect. 'He never wanted to go to book parties. In fact, he much preferred to hang out with his cricket friends.'</p> <p>Even so, O'Neill discovered that people in New York were more interested in his work than they had been in London. 'I thought it was normal if you're a writer to get absolutely zero encouragement from anyone you met. I thought it was normal for even your friends to express no real interest in what you were doing and to take the piss as and when the opportunity arose. Here, much to my amazement, people would say, \"Oh you're a writer, you must meet so and so. Come round for dinner.\" Whereas if you meet someone in London, and you say come round for dinner, they think you're weird. \"Don't you have friends of your own?\" \"Who's this loser who wants us to come round for dinner? Why can't he have dinner with his own pals, like everyone else?\"'</p> <p>Notwithstanding the dinner invitations, he was initially homesick for London, his friends and family. He had enjoyed being a barrister and drew a great deal of professional satisfaction from the job. Although he continued to work for a year or so on 'run-off' cases, a crunch point was waiting for him. Originally, O'Neill and Singer had planned to stay for two years and then return to London. But as that deadline loomed, he was faced with the choice of going back to the law or becoming a full-time writer. If he returned to the bar, he felt that he would have to give up writing because, as a parent, he wouldn't have time for the law, his kids and literature, too.</p> <p>'It was really hard. Everyone I spoke to said, \"That's a tough decision.\" Then my wife said: \"Why don't you go and see the shrink,\" who's an expert on the question of the crossroads. So I went to see this guy, who knows all about life's forks, and I said, \"I have this really difficult problem. On the one hand, there's the bar, years of experience, my income and my family, maybe I should support my family. Then there's the writing...\"</p> <p>'He said, \"Yes I see that is a difficult problem. Tell me, what do you want to do?\"</p> <p>'I said, \"Well, of course I want to be a writer.\" And he said: \"Well, there you are.\"</p> <p>'Nobody had authorised me, because I was, and I am, a sort of conventional soul. I felt it was self-indulgent, but as he well understood - it was a one-session problem - the price you pay for not doing what you want to do is incalculable.'</p> <p>The resolution of one problem, however, opened up another: the business of writing a novel. O'Neill's first two novels, This is the Life and The Breezes, were suffused with intelligence and good writing, but essentially comic in tone and limited in scope. He knew it was time to stretch himself.</p> <p>'My ambition right at the beginning was to write the kind of book that I like to read, which is a \"voice\". You don't really care what the preoccupations are, you just want to be with this voice. I remember talking to my friend Albert Weinstein [a fellow Chelsea Hotel inhabitant], who's now dead, and he said that's a really hard thing to write.'</p> <p>James Wood suggested O'Neill should have cried 'Eureka!' when he had the idea of writing about cricket. 'It didn't seem like that,' the Irishman recalls. 'I had no other ideas. It's not like I had War and Peace up my sleeve. I just had another tacky novel about blokes as my fallback novel, and no one would actually want to read or buy that. And there was no point in delivering a novel preparatory to something else. So I went for broke, and that's in fact the only way to write.'</p> <p>After five years, though, it was the author who was broke, not financially so much as creatively. In a log cabin in the wilds of Canada, where he had gone to focus on writing, he realised he couldn't write the book he wanted to write. He phoned Singer and told her that he was giving up.</p> <p>'I was stuck in Canada and my plane ticket didn't take me back for another couple of days, so I read for a day and I read a book that really helped me called Housekeeping, by Marilynne Robinson. She is the sort of person who spends 20 years writing a novel. It was so slow. Nothing really happened and it was so attentive just to sentences. And I suddenly thought, why don't I write exactly what I want to write and to hell with the plot points.'</p> <p>He junked the second half of the book and started again from scratch. The result is a gorgeous, ruminative prose in which every sentence feels written, not typed. Comparisons have been made to F Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece The Great Gatsby, and the poignant echo of that book can be clearly heard in a number of passages. The elegy is not commonplace in the modern English novel. There are examples, like Alan Hollinghurst's exquisite The Line of Beauty, which is also reminiscent of Gatsby, but on the whole it's an American form, inextricably tied to what Mehta, in relation to Netherland, called 'the compromised beauty of the American dream'.</p> <p>'I think Gatsby's mourning something much broader than the American dream,' says O'Neill. 'That last sentence [\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\"], he's thinking more about the tragedy of time.'</p> <p>By contrast, it could be said that in Netherland the tragedy is more concerned with space, or dislocation. Time washes back and forth like the tide, but the real struggle is for a sense of place. Chuck's dream is to build a cricket ground where no one wants it. Hans's cricket team have to fight for their small slice of park land against competing and more popular sports. Hidden in the suburbs are the forgotten foundations of New York's history. Hans spends his sleepless nights looking at Google Earth images of the house in London to which his wife and son have moved. He lives in the suspended reality of the Chelsea Hotel, a kind of urban Neverland. And Ground Zero is the empty hole that fills the city's nightmares.</p> <p>Netherland: rarely has a one-word title worked on so many levels. Indeed it's so perfect that I wondered if he had it right from the start or whether he had a 'Trimalchio moment' - Fitzgerald at one time had planned to call The Great Gatsby Trimalchio in West Egg.</p> <p>'I certainly did have a Trimalchio moment,' O'Neill confesses. 'For years the book was called The Brooklyn Dream Game, till my friend, the poet Paul Muldoon, raised a friendly eyebrow... and I thought I had a terrific title. Netherland was suggested by Sally.'</p> <p><strong>As a teenager, O'Neill played cricket for the Netherlands' </strong>under-19 side. He kept up the sport in England and, when he came to New York, he set about looking for a game. Eventually he called up the Staten Island cricket club. 'Joe,' asked the club official, 'are you a white man?' 'Yes,' O'Neill replied. 'Well,' said the official, 'you better pack a helmet.'</p> <p>As with Hans, O'Neill's teammates were largely Asian and West Indian. Though it was a 'recreational decision' to take up cricket, he soon realised that he'd stumbled across a promising milieu for a novel. 'But I knew that I would have to spend another year or two penetrating the closed world of New York cricket.'</p> <p>Did he think he'd also located a suitable fictional arena in which to investigate the 'post-colonial' tensions to which Wood had referred?</p> <p>'I think you sense the metaphorical resonance of what you're writing without analysing it too carefully,' says O'Neill. 'That leads you down dead ends. You stop imagining things and start writing towards these themes. I think if you're writing about cricket you're obviously writing about power, because cricket is such a loaded sport, much more so than soccer. And in this country it's a sport of powerlessness.'</p> <p>One of O'Neill's fellow cricketers at the Staten Island cricket club is Habib Rehman, a 43-year-old taxi driver originally from Pakistan. 'He's my brother,' Habib told me outside the Chelsea Hotel. 'I call myself half-Irish and he calls himself half-Pakistani.' Habib hadn't read Netherland. He said he was waiting for an Urdu translation.</p> <p>Habib took us out to Brooklyn in his cab to see some of the places O'Neill describes in his book. It was a Friday and he had come straight from the mosque. 'I love Brooklyn,' he told me. He reeled off the street names and districts as if they were magical legends - Flatbush, Prospect Park, Brooklyn Heights - and sung the praises of the rich mix of people on the streets. 'Here,' he said, pointing out one parade of shops, 'they're West Indian. Those women,' he said of an approaching group of hijabis, 'they're Punjabi, like me. And those there,' gesturing towards some women in brightly coloured saris, 'they're from Bangladesh.'</p> <p>He took obvious pride in the multicultural make-up of his adopted home in a way, it struck me, that is unusual in Britain. In one sense, he occupied the margins of American life, working the nightshift in a taxi, playing cricket beyond the boundaries of fashionable Manhattan, and yet he seemed enthusiastic about his life prospects. Chuck Ramkissoon, too, is a man who knows that he is estranged from conventional American success and yet he retains an engaging, if perhaps misplaced, optimism about the way forward.</p> <p>O'Neill showed me a large wooden house in the classic American suburban mould in one of the more leafy districts of Brooklyn. It was an attractive home, full of space and light and horse chestnut trees. O'Neill and his family had lived here for a while during a hiatus away from the Chelsea Hotel. But they sold up and moved back to the hotel because Singer felt cut off from the action of Manhattan.</p> <p>Perhaps it's too melodramatic to call a change of neighbourhood a crisis of identity, but if Netherland has a point it's that our surroundings shape who we are and how we feel. And the more detached we are from our environment, the more disengaged we become from ourselves. For Hans, this realisation hits home during a bizarre date with a bewitching young woman who wants to be thrashed. He glimpses a reflection of himself wielding his belt and suddenly he feels a sadness 'produced when the mirroring world no longer offers a surface in which one may recognise one's true likeness'.</p> <p>Later, he's taken to the graveyard of the 18th-century Dutch reform church in Brooklyn. Chuck expects Hans to experience some kind of tribal connection among his dead countrymen. But he feels nothing. Looking at the headstones, with names like Jansen, van Dam and de Jong, Hans asks: 'What was one supposed to do with this information?'</p> <p>It's an interesting question because O'Neill knows how ghosts from the past can weigh on the living. In Blood-Dark Track, the memoir he published shortly before 9/11, he tells the story of his Turkish grandfather who was imprisoned by the British during the Second World War, and that of his Irish grandfather who was jailed at the same time for being a member of the IRA. Among other things, it's a fascinating exploration of familial and national identity. Towards the end of the book, during an argument with his Republican uncle, O'Neill becomes 'furious' that his patriotism and Irish nationality is brought into question.</p> <p>Nowadays, he seems to have come to terms with his rootless status. Indeed, he recognises its advantages. 'You don't have a functioning substantial identity as a writer,' he says, as we follow in Hans's footsteps in the graveyard of the Dutch church. 'You have a notional identity... I used to be quite exercised by nationality, but really I was an early member of the global flotsam. And if you stop thinking in terms of countries, you're left with cities.'</p> <p>If he thinks of another city, it is London, which he describes as a 'fantastic place'. But he also harbours reservations about the narrowness of vision it can impose. Netherland makes a number of references to the temporal currents that Fitzgerald writes of in Gatsby, so it is surely worth noting when Hans observes: 'Londoners remain in the business of rowing their boats gently down the stream.'</p> <p>'It's a nihilistic thing,' says O'Neill, when I ask about this sentence. 'It's about shrinking the significance of their achievements. People find satisfaction in shrinking their lives. It's an English recipe for living. Whereas here [in New York] there is in the air an almost inexhaustible sense of possibility.'</p> <p>Perhaps it says something about the endlessly expanding nature of American horizons that just recently O'Neill has begun to think Chuck's doomed scheme to popularise cricket in the States, which represents futility in the novel, may yet come to fruition in the real world. 'I mean,' says O'Neill, 'it would surprise me still, but it's now within the bounds of imagination.'</p> <p>Americans falling for cricket? That sounds a little far-fetched to my ears. Almost as incredible, in fact, as a novel about cricket becoming an American bestseller.</p>",

With Amazon's Kindle eBook rumoured to be hitting Britain shortly as well, it seems that the UK book trade is finally embracing the long-promised 'digital revolution'.

You could save about \u00a3100, it estimates, by shopping around; the average online conveyancing quote for a house being purchased at \u00a3250,000 stands at around \u00a3950, it adds, but you could find one for \u00a3835 using the site.</p> <p>'We want the conveyancing process to be made easier and we're trying to give people a choice so that they can find the best deal,' says David Jackson, head of e-commerce at the society. 'You can seek a conveyancing company near you and can walk into if you need to speak to someone in person.'</p> <p>Conveyancing is the catch-all term for the legal transfer of the ownership of a property, from local authority searches to the exchange of contracts, and the transfer of funds and title deeds. It's also a bugbear for millions of movers every year, according to the Legal Complaints Service (LCS) that oversees disputes between solicitors and clients. There are more complaints about conveyancing than anything else, it says; in the first six months of this year, it received more than 2,000, many relating to poor information about fees. </p> <p>'It is a real concern for homebuyers if things drag on,' says Tim Miller, casework adviser for the LCS. 'Always share your timescale with your solicitor and make sure they are aware of the schedule you are aiming for, but there can be issues out of the solicitor's hands, such as delays with searches, and in that case, we would expect the solicitor to keep the client updated.'</p> <p>Both sellers and buyers need a conveyancer, as do remortgagees; solicitors can carry out conveyancing work, but there are also specialist conveyancing companies which only do such work and nothing else and their conveyancers should also be legally trained. </p> <p>Conveyancing costs differ according to property type; leasehold properties can cost more than freehold. The Council for Licensed Conveyancers (CLC) says this is because 'there is considerably more work involved with the investigation of title to a leasehold property. It is necessary to comprehensively check an often exhaustive amount of information supplied by leasehold management companies and also the terms of the lease itself to make sure that no problems will follow for the purchaser.'</p> <p>Jackson says that using <a href=\"http://www.compareconveyancers.co.uk\">compareconveyancers.co.uk</a> could potentially save you money because it cuts down on the time it takes to get a quote. </p> <p>'In most cases, the amount of time taken to provide you with the quote online is much less than it would be if you were to visit the solicitor face to face or over the telephone. Legal services are notoriously expensive, so whenever time can be saved by collecting all the essential information directly from you, the saving can be passed on to the client directly.'</p> <p>You also can save a lot of money, he advises, because much is done automatically; you are given electronic updates on email or via text message, so you shouldn't have to phone the solicitor for updates, which would otherwise also cost you.</p> <p>'Don't be afraid to ask your solicitor any questions before you instruct them,' adds Miller. 'In some cases, you may agree a fixed fee, but if the transaction is aborted and the sale or purchase falls through, they may end up charging you on an hourly basis, which can end up being even more expensive. Ultimately, moving house is one of the biggest decisions you make, so take the time to read everything your solicitor sends you, and even if the language isn't clear, don't hesitate to ask them to explain it.'</p> <p>Other conveyancing-related complaints are to do with delays and solicitors failing to respond to letters and phone calls. Technically, you could carry out your own conveyancing, though this isn't recommended. 'Unless you have the extensive legal knowledge, it's not worth even considering it,' says Jackson. 'You might be saving yourself the couple of hundred quid you'd pay to a conveyancer, but you would be putting tens of thousands at risk if you got any detail wrong.'</p> <p>Whether you choose a conveyancer or a conveyancing solicitor, ensure they are regulated and licensed to operate. Conveyancers should be licensed by the CLC, while solicitors will be regulated by the Solicitors' Regulation Authority.</p>",
  "<p>Muscat is a great and ramified family of vine varieties, which are unusual in that they produce wines that actually smell and taste of grapes. Muscat vines tend to thrive in hot climates and the grapes come in many colours, from greenish yellow through pink to dark brown, but almost all of them produce wine that was white at least in its youth (the dark-skinned black muscat, or muscat of Hamburg, is an exception). They have historically made rich, heady dessert wines, but are increasingly being made into dry(ish) table wines in the style of muscat d'Alsace.</p> <p>The finest, most ancient muscat vine is small-berried and usually light-skinned, called muscat blanc \u00e0 petits grains. This is responsible for France's most distinguished vins doux naturels (sweet wines) - muscat de Beaumes de Venise, muscat de St Jean de Minervois, muscat de Frontignan, muscat de Lunel and the more obscure muscat de Mireval. Its wines often hint at orange flowers and spice. </p> <p>This variety is grown all over central and eastern Europe, and is responsible for Greece's rich tradition of muscats and, as moscato, for north-west Italy's spumante industry. In South Africa, it is known as muskadel. </p> <p>Muscat of Alexandria makes much less distinguished wine - marmalade rather than orange blossom is a useful shorthand - although Portugal's moscatel of Setubal and its dry counterparts can be interesting. Carefully vinified, muscat can provide useful blending material, particularly for medium-dry blends, and is widely grown for Rivesaltes in Roussillon. Any Spanish wine called simply moscatel is likely to be made from this variety, and moscatels from ancient vines around Malaga can be extremely fine.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Nivole Moscato d'Asti Michele Chiarlo 2007, Italy</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99 for 37.5cl, Booths; \u00a36.99 for 37.5cl, Oddbins</strong></p> <p>Just effervescent, sweet but not cloying, and at 5%, blissfully low in alcohol, this delicately peachy wine is one to pour into large glasses and sip on a weekend afternoon.

  "<p>The defining moments of the international season came in a couple of text messages. Well, it has been a dreadfully wet summer and we are all slaves of the mobile phone now. </p> <p>On Sunday 3 August, the day after the Edgbaston Test, this appeared: 'Michael Vaughan will be giving a press conference at Loughborough today at 1pm.' The moment we received that we all knew he was going, but he had taken us by surprise. </p> <p>The text received at 10.15am on Friday 18 July at Headingley seemed even more prosaic. The ECB kindly deliver the final XI to our mobile phones on the morning of a Test match a few minutes before the toss. This particular message seemed routine enough until we alighted upon the name of Darren Pattinson. </p> <p>Both these texts suggested an England regime in disarray, with no idea which direction to take. The Australians, if they deigned to take notice, must have been guffawing heartily. '2009? No worries. Their best player has spat the dummy. And they've picked a roof tiler from Dandenong, who could hardly get a game for Victoria.' Yet we end this so-called summer bubbling with optimism. Bring on the Aussies. We have got our own Kevin now and in a charisma battle our Pietersen trumps your Rudd. </p> <p>It is a measure of Vaughan's self-possession that we could not anticipate his departure. Steve Harmison is quoted in Marcus Trescothick's book as saying that Vaughan was 'a brilliant liar'. He meant that Vaughan had the capacity to hide his feelings and, in particular, his doubts. We now know that Vaughan was ill at ease as far back as the tour of New Zealand last spring, unsure whether he should start the 2008 season as captain. He seemed pretty relaxed at the time. </p> <p>With hindsight there probably were signs. In May just before the New Zealand series, when Andrew Flintoff was still expected to be fit for the start of the international summer, Vaughan kept talking about batting the colossus at seven and playing four bowlers. We could not understand why, unless it was because the captain was so uncomfortable about dropping a batsman who had been scoring more runs than him. </p> <p>At Headingley against South Africa we were gobsmacked by the selection of Pattinson. The converted Aussie was not the captain's choice, but if Vaughan's mind had been right, he would have intervened with a quiet 'I'm not leading this side out' to the national selector or coach. Instead he merely acknowledged 'a confused selection' after the game. </p> <p>At Edgbaston a trivial little spat with the BBC's Jonathan Agnew betrayed that all was not well. There was an attempted joke that misfired. 'How many Test caps did you get?' is an argument that we have grown accustomed to Ian Botham using over the years, but not Vaughan. </p> <p>So the day after the best international cricket match of the summer Vaughan departed with dignity and a tear or two. And the wheels, we assumed, were off. </p> <p>A month later it is 'Michael who?' We are all nuts about KP. Life goes on. No one is indispensable. So a reminder: Vaughan has been England's most successful cricket captain in history; his cocktail of calmness and boldness enabled us to enjoy the most mesmerising series in living memory in 2005. His batting in Australia in 2002-03 would have made Pietersen gasp. </p> <p>To his credit he wants to return to Test cricket before taking up easier options beyond the boundary. One day he might end up guiding England as a selector, coach or director if he can avoid the pull of the Sky box. </p> <p>Matthew Hoggard, his county colleague, has faded away even more imperceptibly after 67 Test appearances and 248 Test wickets, sixth on England's list behind Botham, Bob Willis, Fred Trueman, Derek Underwood and Brian Statham. Not bad for a bloke who only ever bowled just above 80mph and swung the ball one way. Like Angus Fraser in the 1990s Hoggard maximised every ounce of limited talent. And he played one great cover drive (Trent Bridge 2005). It would be a surprise if Hoggard played for England again. </p> <p>So we move on without much sentiment. James Anderson, 34 Test wickets this summer, has Hoggard's place now and Ryan Sidebottom, recuperating after an arduous year, is the first reserve. Stuart Broad is here to stay. Flintoff and Harmison are back. Monty Panesar remains the best spinning option for Test cricket mainly because of a dearth of rivals, but there is the suspicion that he has been treading water. Any improvements with the bat and in the field appear to have stalled, and it is time he developed as a bowler. </p> <p>The crux of the summer came at Edgbaston, where the Test against South Africa fluctuated deliciously. In 2008 Graeme Smith's mind and body were more jaded than in 2003. He could not churn out the runs regularly, but he had the stomach to play one great innings that decided the series and brought about Vaughan's exit. Smith's mastery of Panesar was critical at Edgbaston. </p> <p>I have always defended Panesar's reluctance to experiment. The armchair men want him to loop the ball, to bowl more slowly, to bowl like Underwood one day, Tufnell the next. That was always asking too much of a man who does not have an intuitive feel for the game. But if Panesar was prepared to bowl the occasional arm-ball - it's not that difficult - his life would be easier. At Edgbaston Smith would not have been able to work every ball to the leg-side. In India, where the ball is expected to turn, an arm ball is also a vital piece of ammunition. </p> <p>Of the batsmen Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen provide the spine for the future. Andrew Strauss, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood are safe at the moment, but not absolutely sure. There are three, all of Asian origin, to threaten them, Owais Shah, Ravi Bopara and, rushing up on the rails, Samit Patel, pictured, who might just win a place in the Test squad for India as a batting second spinner. </p> <p>And there is Vaughan. My fear is that if he plays in the Ashes next summer it will be as a rabbit, plucked desperately out of a hat, when England are trailing badly in the series. Vaughan does not have much time to stake a claim for the India or Caribbean Tests and for the moment Pietersen may be wise to go his own way without Vaughan hovering in the background. Unless Strauss falters badly this winter the door is barely ajar for Vaughan. </p> <p>So Pietersen's personnel are in place for the next 12 months. The new captain has already identified his key assets. Flintoff and Harmison at full throttle have been tremendous on the field and in the dressing room. Both are hungry. Six years ago the news that Flintoff was looking hungry was probably a bad thing. Now when he looks hungry - and lean - that's ideal. And Harmison is bowling fast and straight and smiling. </p> <p>Both are firing because of their recent absences from international cricket. None of the players talks about burn-out anymore. Eighteen months ago they spoke of little else. The advent of Mr Stanford and the Indian Leagues has created a wall of silence on this issue. England's best will be eager to scamper over to the IPL for some cheap dollars in April and we cannot really blame them for that. Strong, sensitive management is needed. </p> <p>They may not talk about burn-out, but it still exists. How many reminders are necessary? Look at the most stalwart of recent England cricketers. There is Vaughan, whose mind, by his own admission, had 'gone'. Collingwood has more or less admitted the same. He resigned the one-day captaincy just in time to save his Test place with the second most memorable innings - after Smith's - of the summer . For Sidebottom the strain has been physical rather than mental and for a further reminder dip into Trescothick's illuminating autobiography. These are England's finest all laid low by the unrelenting volume of international cricket. </p> <p>There are intriguing challenges ahead before the next Test series with our Antipodean friends. As well as running off with the money, can Team England overcome the divisive nature of the trip to Antigua for the Twenty20 match against the Stanford Superstars? Seven ODIs in seven corners of India will be rather more taxing than the recent matches against the demoralised South Africa. There are eight Tests to be played (assuming Sri Lanka turn up in May) before we all descend upon Cardiff again for the first Ashes Test of 2009 as well as a Twenty20 world championship. Somewhere along the line Pietersen will have to demonstrate that he can deal with defeat. </p> <p>A month ago such a schedule seemed a daunting, impenetrable maze. Five victories against South Africa later, with Pietersen as sure-footed as a sapper, there is hope. The Aussies - apart from Andrew Symonds, who has gone fishing - may still be guffawing, but a little more uneasily.</p>",
  "<p>Players in trouble with the law, controversial free agency signings, a drawn-out draft, pre-season exhibitions, players changing their surnames by deed poll from Johnson to Javon Ocho Cinco - it has been quite an off-season, and that was just the Cincinnati Bengals. But 214 long days after they shocked the NFL by defeating the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLII, the New York Giants kicked off the new season of the world's most ostentatious league on Thursday night with an impressive victory over the Washington Redskins.</p> <p>The biggest shock at Giants Stadium was that Natasha Bedingfield was asked to provide the razzmatazz during the pre-game show, but ahead of the opening games for the NFL's other 30 teams there has been one even more surprising storyline - the momentous departure of future Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre from the Green Bay Packers after 15 years as the face of the franchise.</p> <p>Back in March, following the Pack's elimination by the Giants in the NFC Championship game (one step from the Super Bowl), the 38-year-old three-time Most Valuable Player made an emotional retirement from the sport. Favre, who holds every meaningful career record for quarterbacks, broke down in tears as he told America: 'I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. That's what it really comes down to. I have nothing left to give.'</p> <p>In July word seeped out that Favre had approached the Packers about a return to the team, the rumours so strong that computer game makers EA Sports depicted him in Green Bay uniform on their cover for Madden NFL 09, traditionally something of a jinx. But Green Bay claimed they wanted to take the team in a different direction and, after a month of considerable acrimony and sniping between the two parties, Favre was traded to the New York Jets, 'the largest thing to hit the Big Apple since Godzilla' according to ESPN, leaving his successor Aaron Rodgers with a considerable pair of cleats to fill.</p> <p>Favre will make his Jets debut today and, as fate would have it, his opposing quarterback will be the man he replaces in New York - the Miami Dolphins' new acquisition, Chad Pennington. </p> <p>The intriguing Dolphins v Jets match-up is the first of seven live games on British TV over the next 48 hours, highlighting the growing fascination with the NFL on these shores, its appeal rising towards the level it reached during the late 1980s and early 1990s when Dan Marino, Joe Montana and Troy Aikman were names well-known to many UK households. </p> <p>Sparking the rise in interest was last October's game at Wembley, the first played outside North America. While it was a damp squib in more ways than one, the attraction of the Giants and the Dolphins was clear as tickets sold out within minutes of going on sale. On the back of that success the NFL announced there will be one game in Britain in each of the next three seasons, and tickets have again been snapped up for this October's game at the same venue, with the San Diego Chargers and the New Orleans Saints, two of the league's most potent offensive teams, handpicked to provide fans with high-scoring entertainment. </p> <p>Those same Chargers and Saints could well meet again in another one-off showpiece: Super Bowl XLIII in Tampa Bay on 1 February. Both teams believe the trip to London is a potential good luck charm, having noted how the Giants benefited from their visit to go on to win the championship, just as the Boston Celtics won the NBA title after playing in the capital. </p> <p>There are less superstitious reasons for each team to be optimistic. The Chargers have the league's best running back, LaDainian Tomlinson, a reliable quarterback in Philip Rivers and an explosive defense led by Shawne Merriman. Merriman missed a pitiful four games in 2006 for 'violating the NFL's steroid policy', but the team's one major concern this year is over his determination to play despite having two torn ligaments in his left knee. </p> <p>More significant, however, are the injury worries to the lynchpin of each of their two main AFC rivals: the Patriots' Tom Brady, who coach Bill Belichick says will play today despite reports of a fractured foot, and the Indianapolis Colts' Peyton Manning, who has a 'burst bursa sac' in his knee. Either team could struggle without the two best quarterbacks of this era.</p> <p>New Orleans, meanwhile, have had their preparations disrupted by Hurricane Gustav. Having trained for the past week in Indianapolis, the Saints return to the city for today's opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at an emotion-charged Superdome, which was a refuge for stricken inhabitants following Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>In the NFC their closest challengers will be the Seattle Seahawks, by virtue of being in the weak West division, the Minnesota Vikings and their strong running back Adrian Peterson, the Giants, who have been hit by retirements and injuries, and the talented Dallas Cowboys, who will hope quarterback Tony Romo is not distracted by his high-profile relationship with Jessica Simpson, an accusation that was thrown at him last year. </p> <p>Such is the parity in the NFL, it is as tough to predict as ever. And perhaps it is that which is appealing more and more to a country used to the lopsided inequality of the Premier League.</p>",
  "<p>FOR NIGEL Worthington, the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu was crushing. Anxious to build on the wave of optimism and heightened expectation that had followed Northern Ireland's narrow failure to reach this summer's Euro 2008 finals in Austria and Switzerland, the manager was instead confronted by the familiar failings that afflict his side whenever they leave their Windsor Park comfort zone. </p> <p>Second-half goals - both avoidable - from Liverpool's Martin Skrtel and Marek Hamsik exposed Northern Ireland's tendency to under-perform on their travels. And while an own goal from Jan Durica, nine minutes from time, inspired an impressive late rally, it was insufficient to prevent a deflating defeat for the fifth time in their past six opening qualifying games. </p> <p>Not for the first time, the Irish must repair that damage at home, this time against Group 3 favourites Czech Republic, who toyed with England at Wembley last month. Recent history suggests that a morale-boosting win is far from beyond Worthington's side, but the true test of their hopes of qualifying for a major finals for the first time since 1986 will be their ability to prevent a repeat of this kind of defeat. </p> <p>'It was a game we should have got something from,' said Worthington. 'But through ill-discipline on set plays, we have paid a heavy price and lost the game. That's the frustrating thing. To concede two goals from set plays is very disappointing. In the first half, they had a lot of possession, but did not really hurt us. Then we go a goal down straight after half-time. That put us on the back foot and we had to get ready to go again. </p> <p>'We showed more of what we are about in the last 15-20 minutes, but it's hugely disappointing because we could have got something from the game. The Czech match was tough before this - it is even tougher now. We have to get a result.' </p> <p>The disappointment within Northern Ireland ranks was accentuated by the denial of a penalty when Chris Baird's shot appeared to hit a Slovak defender's arm. While Worthington's men protested, the home side broke, earning the free-kick that led to the second goal. </p> <p>'I don't blame referees when there are penalty shouts,' Worthington said. 'That can be seen as an excuse. If he gives it he gives it; if not, we get on with the game. If we don't concede the second goal, we go away with a point, which is a fair result and we are off the mark.' </p> <p>Worthington has attempted to transform his side's fortunes away from home by reshaping the team, drafting in Baird as a holding midfielder - and, for the first half at least, the plan appeared to work. It was Northern Ireland who carved out the better opportunities, with David Healy and Sammy Clingan threatening in the opening 10 minutes </p> <p>Healy had a second, clearer, opportunity two minutes before the interval and, given his previous exploits in a green shirt - he came into this game having scored 34 goals in 65 international appearances - he should have done better than pull his shot across the face of the goal. </p> <p>In between, though, Slovakia had asserted more control on the game, yet, despite their steady improvement, it was Northern Ireland who reached half-time with growing confidence. </p> <p>That, however, was to change dramatically 55 seconds into the second half, when Keith Gillespie - making his first appearance of the season after an ankle injury - committed a clumsy free-kick on the Irish right. The ball in was met by Skrtel, who headed powerfully past Maik Taylor in the Northern Ireland goal. </p> <p>Worse was to come when, Baird having been denied the penalty shout, Durica was allowed to head the ball back across the face of the goal, where Hamsik finished from close range for Slovakia's second in the 70th minute. </p> <p>Durica turned Chris Brunt's cross into his own goal 11 minutes later to give Northern Ireland hope and spark a late rally that could easily have earned Worthington's side a point. Defender George McCartney was convinced he had equalised when he connected with a last-minute header, but his effort was kept out by Slovakia keeper Stefan Senecky.</p>",
  "<p>The competition between Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa has become so intense that every advantage assumes increased significance as the season enters its final third. Hamilton may have taken his 11th pole position, but the mix of pleasure and relief was evident as the Englishman weighed up the benefits, psychological and practical, for the start of today's Belgian Grand Prix on one of the most demanding tracks on the calendar. </p> <p>Massa had gained an edge in the previous two races by enjoying a performance advantage for which Hamilton and McLaren had no obvious answer. Hamilton's satisfaction will have therefore been increased yesterday when Massa was honest enough to admit that his best lap had been perfect, but clearly not good enough, to the tune of 0.35 seconds - a sizeable margin even allowing for Spa-Francorchamps being the longest on the calendar and Hamilton locking his brakes going into the first corner. </p> <p>'I've been happy with all of my laps,' said Hamilton. 'I locked up going in to Turn 1 on that last lap, but kept the rest of the lap together. [Following neck problems before the previous race] I've been feeling better than ever and more and more comfortable in the car. With the package that we have, I had the feeling all along that we're going to be hard to beat. The team has been making good choices given the limited running that we've had.' </p> <p>Having had Friday afternoon's preparations compromised by a wet track, there was little chance of recovering lost ground yesterday morning when fine drizzle affected parts of the circuit during the hour of free practice. At least the drivers had a taste of the difficulties involved if, as seems possible in the micro-climate produced in this corner of the Ardennes, rain returns this afternoon. </p> <p>'We don't have traction control on the cars any more and that's going to make it very hard here if it rains,' said Hamilton when referring to the 4.5-mile track that is made up largely of what were public roads before Spa became a closed, permanent circuit two years ago. 'The white lines get very slippery and it's very important that you don't touch them if it's wet.' </p> <p>Kimi Raikkonen can vouch for the potential hazard presented by the slippery surfaces after spinning off and damaging his Ferrari on Friday. It was a bad start to a weekend during which the reigning world champion needs to reassert himself after failing to win since the Spanish Grand Prix in April. Raikkonen has won the past three races at Spa, a circuit that encourages a flair that, recently, has been cramped by his inability to make the Ferrari and its tyres work at the same efficient level achieved by Massa.</p> <p>Raikkonen's problems continued yesterday when he made a mistake during his best lap and dropped to fourth, behind the McLaren of Heikki Kovalainen. </p> <p>'That small mistake cost me valuable time and a place on the grid,' said Raikkonen. 'All the same, I'm reasonably happy with my car, which seems to be behaving the way I like. Of course, I'm a bit disappointed; fourth place is far from ideal when looking for a win. But it doesn't mean I've given up hope. We know we have good potential, especially in race trim.' </p> <p>Raikkonen has 44 laps in which to reassert himself and ensure that his points deficit is not large enough to allow Ferrari to put their championship emphasis behind Massa with five races remaining.</p> <p>Rumours continue to persist that Ferrari have not been impressed by Raikkonen's performances and the Finn may be replaced by Fernando Alonso, who did his usual impressive job with the Renault to qualify sixth behind Nick Heidfeld.</p> <p>It is an interesting juxtaposition for Alonso and BMW in the face of additional rumours that the German company have been making strong overtures to Alonso at the expense of Heidfeld. Appropriately for Heidfeld, fifth place yesterday equals his best qualifying position in another otherwise disappointing season. </p> <p>Meanwhile, FIA officials caused controversy during the GP2 race yesterday when Bruno Senna was given a drive-through penalty after his team, iSport International, had been deemed to cause the unsafe release of their driver during a pit stop. Senna had come close to colliding with another car in precisely the same way as Massa had when released from his pit in Valencia as the Force India of Adrian Sutil drew alongside. Massa was allowed to continue on his way to victory in the European Grand Prix, Ferrari later receiving a fine. </p> <p>Senna was forced to relinquish a lead he had held from the start, as he drove through the pits and rejoined in 24th place. The penalty could have cost Senna the championship. The Brazilian's only consolation as he finished out of the points in 12th place was that his main rival, Giorgio Pantano, had an eventful afternoon, spinning more than once and eventually retiring. Yesterday's dramatic race was won by Romain Grosjean, the Frenchman moving into third place in the championship, five points behind Senna with three rounds remaining.</p>",
  "<p>The world's number one footballer, Kak\u00e1, will consider joining Manchester City next summer if the newly enriched club achieve their initial target of Champions League qualification.</p> <p>Since last Sunday, City have been under the control of the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), a vehicle of a Middle East sovereign wealth fund whose representatives have promised to turn them into 'the biggest club in the world, bigger than both Real Madrid and Manchester United' by pursuing 'the biggest players in the world'.</p> <p>Kak\u00e1, Fifa's current World Player of the Year, has been seeking an exit from AC Milan and thought he would be allowed to leave for Chelsea during the summer. Milan ultimately decided against selling the 26-year-old Brazilian, but he believes the club will sanction a 100m euros transfer in a year's time. </p> <p>'Kak\u00e1 would prefer a club like Chelsea, Real Madrid or Milan, but we never know,' Kak\u00e1's representative Diogo Kotscho told The Observer. 'This season Manchester City do not have a team to win the Champions League. Maybe next season they can get into that competition - they have the prospects to be good enough. What they need to have is a big project to win the Premier League and the Champions League. It's not just about Kak\u00e1, they will only get the very best players if they attain this level. It was the same with Chelsea a few years ago - they had to prove themselves too.</p> <p>'I think Manchester City are headed in the right direction, but they have big work to do. It's no easy thing to reach the same level as the biggest clubs in the world, and it's not just about money - you have to spend it properly and build a great team. In two or three years they can be there if they do the right things.'</p> <p>In their first 24 hours as City's owners ADUG lodged British record bids of more than \u00a330m each for Tottenham's Dimitar Berbatov, Valencia's David Villa and Real Madrid's Robinho, forcing up Manchester United's expenditure on Berbatov and stealing Robinho from Chelsea's grasp. His acquisition was also intended to provide a star name with which to promote City in the Far East.</p> <p>ADUG's takeover is also understood to have caught club officials off guard. In the days preceding City's purchase, new chief executive Garry Cook had said that though the club were seeking investment, they were not for sale. Instead, Thaksin Shinawatra accepted an offer of around \u00a3200m for a club whose expenditure he could no longer afford to service. The final price will not be settled until ADUG complete due diligence on the club's books and the deal could fall through if significant problems are uncovered.</p> <p>Though Thaksin's price demands almost resulted in ADUG withdrawing from the purchase last Sunday, the former Thai prime minister could profit by as much as \u00a380m for his 14 months as owner. Thaksin has been allowed to retain a 10 per cent stake in the company and an honorary position on the board.</p> <p>ADUG forms part of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund managing an estimated $500bn worth of assets. Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan drove the move into Premier League football as a means of promoting the emirate abroad.</p> <p>The contractors on <strong>Liverpool's</strong> postponed new stadium project have denied they are considering legal action against the club. Liverpool announced an indefinite delay on construction of the \u00a3300m Anfield replacement last month, blaming 'global market conditions' yet promising to investigate increasing the stadium's capacity by 13,000 seats to 73,000.</p> <p>Liverpool have been able to begin only preliminary work on the site at Stanley Park, resulting in the European Union withdrawing grants to fund the regeneration of the surrounding area.</p> <p>Though not specifically asked about the possibility of suing Liverpool over the delays, a spokesperson for contractors Laing O'Rourke said: 'Laing O'Rourke continues to work closely with Liverpool FC in order to achieve their ambitions of constructing the new football stadium. Laing O'Rourke further wishes to clarify that it has not considered legal action against Liverpool FC.'</p> <p>Liverpool's American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, face a January deadline for refinancing the \u00a3350m loan with which they have been running the club. A Dubai-based investment fund remain prepared to buy them out for around \u00a3500m, including that debt.</p>",
  "<p>A startling new biography of Roald Dahl, published last week, reveals that the beloved children's author was involved in a string of shady sexual liaisons when he was a British spy during the war. He is said to have acquired 'several useful pieces of intelligence' by seducing women who were close to the sources of power.</p> <p>As you'll know if you've ever done a pub quiz, Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay for You Only Live Twice. This new biographical information sheds an interesting light on his keenness to get involved in the Bond canon: perhaps the screenplay was a confessional.</p> <p>These revelations could be very useful for the Broccoli family. We know they have run out of Ian Fleming plots to film. They can't keep reshooting the old ones with new actors. So why not, instead of returning to the original Fleming novels, return to the original Dahls?</p> <p>Stories are all the same, after all. 'Men's books', 'women's books', 'children's books' - they all offer right and wrong, a chase and a challenge, a crisis and a resolution. However old we are, as readers, we all want the same satisfactions. If the Broccolis need new hooks on which to hang them, a legitimate treasure trove is waiting ...</p> <p>The grey Bentley convertible, a 1933 4.5 litre with an Amherst-Villiers supercharger, purred into the mews and pulled up behind the gaunt spectacle of MI5. He entered the building and walked along the thickly carpeted corridor. The desirable Miss Moneypenny shot him an encouraging smile, so he continued through the double doors. </p> <p>'Ah, 007.' M fished something out of his waistcoat pocket. 'Ever seen one of these?'</p> <p>He tossed it across the desk towards Bond. It fell with a faint whump on the red leather. Fat. Feathery. Dead.</p> <p>'It's a chicken,' said Bond.</p> <p>'We know it's a chicken, Bond. What we want to know is: why?'</p> <p>'Tricky ... to get to the other side?'</p> <p>'Why it died, Bond. And why hundreds of others - chickens, ducks, turkeys - have simply disappeared. Vanished.'</p> <p>Bond nodded. 'Defected?'</p> <p>'We don't know. But we think he may know the answer.'</p> <p>M slid a photograph out of a thick brown folder. Bond looked down at reddish hair, a sweeping tailcoat, a wily gaze.</p> <p>'The villain in question is elusive,' advised M. 'He has created a secret underground headquarters, locatable only via a series of complex tunnels. Almost impenetrable.'</p> <p>'Do we have a name?'</p> <p>'The name's Fox. Fantastic Mr Fox.'</p> <p>Bond reached for the folder.</p> <p>'See if you can find a way in to those tunnels,' whispered M. 'Farmer Boggis tried to get at him with a bulldozer, but to no avail. Something subtler required ...'</p> <p>James Bond took out his black gunmetal cigarette box and his Ronson lighter. He lit a cigarette, one of the Macedonian blend that Morlands of Grosvenor Street made for him, then settled in the padded swivel chair and began to read.</p> <p>'Anything interesting?' asked Felix Leiter, sipping a Scotch and soda.</p> <p>'It's a dossier,' said Bond, 'on one of my target's close associates. A Mrs Twit. She has warts and a glass eye that is always looking the other way.'</p> <p>'I see,' said Leiter. He picked up the dossier and read aloud. 'A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.'</p> <p>'That's all very well,' said Bond. 'But I'm not shagging her.' </p> <p>007 emerged from the lake, unzipped his wetsuit, checked his Rolex Oyster Perpetual and started to climb the factory wall. Suddenly, and quite without warning, he was felled by a blow to the head. Something had been thrown from the lakeside: a sharpened, steel-brimmed bowler hat.</p> <p>Bond stared up at a small man - no more than five foot six, but broad and muscular in chest - who frowned, grunted, picked up the bowler hat and replaced it firmly on his head.</p> <p>'Aha,' said a voice. 'I see you have met my Oompa-Loompa.'</p> <p>When he came round for the second time, Bond found himself in a large copper pot. It was filled with chocolate. The temperature was rising fast.</p> <p>'Mr Wonka, I suppose?' </p> <p>'The same!' shouted the vision in purple before him. </p> <p>'And you expect me to talk?'</p> <p>'No, Mr Bond! I expect you to melt ...' </p> <p>Bond rummaged desperately in his pocket for the pillbox Q had given him that morning.</p> <p>('What is it?' Bond had asked suspiciously. 'A suicide pill? You know, Q, that is not really my style ...'</p> <p>'Nothing of the kind,' Q had patiently explained. 'It is a pill that tastes of tomato soup, steak pie and Christmas pudding. It's a whole three-course meal in one!')</p> <p>Bond snapped open the box and held it towards his adversary.</p> <p>'You will not win me round with that delicious morsel,' snarled Wonka. 'I know you are a spy. You are here to steal my recipes. And that is why you are going to melt ...' </p> <p>'I am a spy,' said Bond. 'But I simply want to arrest your friend Mr Fox, or possibly kill him. I have no interest in the recipes.'</p> <p>'Well, well, why didn't you say?' chuckled Wonka. 'Hop out of that pot and take the Great Glass Elevator - you'll find him in the basement.'</p> <p>Bond's pocket bleeped. He extracted the responsible gadget and barked: 'James Bond.'</p> <p>'Where on earth are you, 007?' came the exasperated voice of M.</p> <p>Bond looked around him. </p> <p>Fantastic Mr Fox belched and picked his teeth with a feather. </p> <p>Mrs Twit removed her glass eye from a beaker of port and took a swig. </p> <p>Willy Wonka helped himself to pudding - a giant peach cobbler.</p> <p>Bond reached for another steaming portion of duck, turkey and chicken.</p> <p>'Everything is under control, M. There are no defections. I'll report back on Tuesday. Meanwhile, let's just say I am enjoying some lovely breasts ...' </p> <p>THE END</p>",
  "<p>If you walk the length of the diplodocus in Alfred Waterhouse's still extraordinary Victorian entrance hall to the Natural History Museum and then follow the curve of its tail you will soon be faced with a comparable surprise: the largest cocoon ever made by man. The cocoon, which has grown quietly in west London since it was first conceived in 2001, will be revealed at the beginning of 2009, in time for Darwin's 200th birthday - 60m long, and eight storeys high, bulging within a huge glass box.</p> <p>Last month I was standing in the shadow of the concrete cocoon with Anna Maria Indrio. Indrio, an Italian, is a partner in the Danish architectural practice CF M\u00f8ller, which has designed the new Darwin extension to the museum. She is herself a force of nature, full of proprietory excitement at her creation: 'Most of all we wanted,' she says, 'to create a skin, a shell for all this fantastic treasure!'</p> <p>The cocoon will house not one insect but 17m of them, all carefully filed and annotated (along with 3m flowering plant specimens) - but it is not just this unparalleled archive that will be stored together for the first time. In the heart of the new building the Natural History Museum will also be putting its greatest living wonders on show: its staff of 220 scientists will be presented in full view of the public.</p> <p>At intervals, along the winding descent through the dramatic cocoon, these rare creatures will be viewed behind glass at their work stations, preparing petri-dishes, peering through microscopes, eating lunch, perhaps grabbing an afternoon nap. At various points the public will have the opportunity to interact directly with them, to ask questions and to examine experiments. </p> <p>The museum believes this initiative will radically change the way it is perceived - that it will shift overnight in the popular imagination from being a home to fabulous old bones to being seen as a living and breathing organism. 'It has sometimes seemed an introverted space,' director of science Richard Lane tells me. 'Now the place will be an extrovert suddenly; there will be a new openness about what we do.'</p> <p>To get a sense of what this new openness might mean I sought out various curators in their corners of the current building, which has, over the last century, spawned its own intricate ecosystem. The scientists are squirrelled away, in Victorian rooms that smell sharply of naphthalene, behind vast oak doors. Labs and desks have grown among the crevices and nooks of 7.5km of mahogany drawers. The beetle men are separated from the botanists, and the botanists can be quietly sniffy about the flashy lepidopterists.</p> <p>Wandering the corridors of this place, within which the vast cocoon is taking shape, I occasionally catch the uncanny atmosphere of David Cronenburg's The Fly, or of Kafka's Metamorphosis. There is no building in London that makes you feel more a human animal than this one. I've always envied the neurologist Oliver Sacks's account of hiding in the Natural History Museum as a boy and spending the night among dinosaur bones: 'Even familiar animals became fearful, uncanny, as I prowled that night,' he recalled, 40 years later, 'their faces suddenly looming out of the darkness or hovering ghostlike at the periphery of the flashlight. The museum, lightless, was a place of delirium, and I was not wholly sorry when morning came ...'</p> <p>Though there is much that is dead in the museum, the scientists are what alchemise it into life. I come across Mark Spencer, curator of plants, floppy haired and T-shirted in the museum's inner sanctum, its holy of holies, the Sloane Herbarium, where all of this began. Hans Sloane, royal physician of the 17th century, bequeathed the first 5,000 specimens to the collection, which prompted Linnaeus to invent his classification system and, with it, botany. Spencer pulls down a leather-bound volume from the stacks around the walls and opens it at random. Pressed and labelled in a neat inked hand is a lilac specimen collected by the Reverend Adam Buddle, the original country pastor and amateur botanist, after whom Linnaeus named the butterfly bush (Buddleia).</p> <p>Spencer's eyes light up. 'We used to think,' he says, 'of British botany as something that was pretty much done and dusted, but now with climate change these books are becoming incredibly important. Among other things they offer an invaluable time series. You can mine them for flowering cycles, carbon content, density of stoma on leaves which changes according to the amount of CO2 in the air - all of that.'</p> <p>Like all the curators I meet, Spencer is clearly in the grip of something of a lifelong obsession. This is much more than a vocation. It was his 40th birthday recently, he explains, and his mum was recalling how she would lie him down on the grass as a baby and he would crawl over to the flower bed and pull off flower heads, start collecting and examining specimens. He has never stopped.</p> <p>He was a gardener at Kew, but after a PhD in fungal evolution he found himself here, in charge of 3m pressed flowers. He spent the first two years studying Linnaeus's seaweed names, finding arcane errors, putting them right. The history of nomenclature, which is one of the functions of this museum, has in part been a story of Chinese whispers, he suggests. It is expensive and embarrassing when you don't get it right. He points to a classic example recently of researchers who, having done an enormous amount of work with medicinal leeches, could not explain their weird data. It turned out, because of a spelling error, they had been using the wrong species for years.</p> <p>In order to keep the archive correct and alive Spencer relies in part on a quiet army of like-minded volunteers. The tradition of the amateur botanist, of Adam Buddle, is alive and well. 'David for example,' he gestures round the corner, where an elderly man is intent at a microscope 'is an expert on hawkweeds and he looks after those for me. There are dozens of people like him.' But still, the collection is not as open as Spencer would like it to be. 'The aim is always if a member of public says, \"I want to look at the plants in my area,\" within reason we will allow that.'</p> <p>The new Darwin cocoon will allow this interaction to go much further. In the coming years Spencer believes we will need to be ever more vigilant about the ways in which our plant life is changing and the museum hopes to enlist the public in its data collection efforts. The current bluebell project - an attempt to discover the extent of the spread of the invasive Spanish variety and the threat to our native flower - run by Spencer, is a case in point. 'Scientists can't collect all the data, but we now have thousands of people helping - and children can learn basic science by getting involved.' Bumble-bee and earthworm projects will follow.</p> <p>This public involvement might prove invaluable in the arguments about climate change, Spencer thinks. 'When the systems really start breaking down, Dutch elm disease-type events will be happening all around. In the last five years there have been profound shifts in the London area, for example. Tree of heaven would never self-set in London. It is increasingly a huge problem now because it is growing everywhere. We have avocado flowering and fruiting. Bougainvillea overwintering on King's Cross Road.'</p> <p>Life thrives on perturbation but the chaos we are going to put ourselves through in the next 50 years will be too much for many native species, Spencer believes. For the time being, though, he has more than enough to keep him happy. Does he have a favourite plant? 'The Lizard peninsula is full of amazing things,' he says. 'There's a little squitty thing called fringed rupture wort which is just like a little green mat on a rock, but it's an endlessly fascinating thing to me. A lot of science is people looking at a plant or whatever and thinking: how on earth does it do that? It is like art: why is something wondrous to people?'</p> <p>This question seems particularly challenging later that afternoon when I meet Dr Martin Hall, who has some of the more extreme insights into all creatures great and small at the museum. Hall is the country's leading forensic scientist, his speciality being the study of maggots in flesh wounds to discover the precise time of a murder.</p> <p>He is a wry and engaging figure, a man who should be a TV drama series. He greets me with a selection of fattened maggots in pots, a kind of juju necklace of maggots removed from the rear end of a sheep, and a series of graphic photographs of wounds (mostly in live animals) in which maggots are making hay. In among the photographs are a couple of pictures of his own legs and arms with livid sores.</p> <p>'I had a personal experience of some of this after I came back from Bolivia one time,' he explains matter of factly, 'along with the maggot of a botfly in my leg. They can eventually get quite large,' - he opens a 2in gap between thumb and forefinger - 'so I could feel this movement and I could see the tip of the maggot coming up to breathe and going back down.'</p> <p>What did he do?</p> <p>'Well you can't really squeeze them out, because they have these backward facing spines. You need surgery. I had a couple in my arm, too. I discovered if you put Vaseline over them they can't breathe and tend to back out of their own accord, eventually.'</p> <p>One of the numerous practical applications of the entomology department - I also come across several scientists devoted to the eradication of the kind of crop pests that can wreck national economies or experts in mosquito behaviour who are helping fight endemic disease - is in criminology. The museum has led the way in this field for the past 25 years. Hall's predecessor wrote the seminal book on the subject. 'Our involvement is three pronged,' Hall says, 'we do research, training and casework.'</p> <p>The casework involves attending the crime scene of around 20 murders a year, some of them extremely high profile. Pathologists are not precise in estimating the time of death, but Hall has developed a method that is pretty foolproof. He collects any insect life or maggots from a corpse and does calculations based on their size correlated against temperature. 'Obviously a crime scene is not a controlled environment but I work out how big they are, and within a range I can usually get to an answer.'</p> <p>I wonder how easy it is to get some of the things he witnesses out of his head. How do you avoid disgust? 'Sometimes it is extremely hard, but there is still a sense of profound curiosity about it all,' he adds, brightly. The point is, he says, that he has 'a huge amount of admiration for these kinds of flies'. There are, too, varieties that have developed only to live in particularly safe places - the nostril of a camel, or the stomach of a rhino. 'The fact is, all the time, you have to take your hat off to evolution.'</p> <p>That phrase might make a good motto for the museum as a whole. The more of its latest exhibits I meet - dragonfly expert Steve Brooks, and curator of arachnids Jan Beccaloni, a woman with a spidery tangle of hair and a line in gothic jewellery - the more I get a sense of the kind of passion for natural wonder that the 'exhibition of scientists' will project. I travel down to Southfields, in south London, to see Blanca Huertas, who is holed up in a warehouse with 3m butterflies in cases. Huertas, a woman who knows an awful lot about cocoons, cannot wait to move to the new building, though the task of transporting the collection is daunting. She is used to a challenge, however.</p> <p>Huertas grew up in Columbia and is engaged in an ongoing study of the butterfly life of some of her homeland's uncharted northern jungles. Her field trips generally involve her being dropped out of a helicopter in the remotest of places with a tent and a butterfly net. She comes back with a few thousand butterflies to catalogue. A couple of years ago she discovered both a new species of butterfly and a new species of bird in these forests. Some of the moths favour coca plants however, and the field work, she says, ruefully, is hampered a little by the presence of drug cartels.</p> <p>Huertas came to the museum first as a volunteer, but she has stayed, inspired by the history of the collection and its extraordinary range. As we talk she pulls open drawers from memory - here are some of Nabokov's radiant blue butterflies, here is a Queen Alexandra butterfly so big that in the 18th century when the first one was discovered the collector shot</p> <p>it with a gun, thinking it was a bird. It still has the hole through its wing. 'The thing is,' Huertas says, 'I believe you can explain everything with butterflies.' She was a teacher in Columbia for a while. 'It is,' she says, 'quite hard in Colombia to earn a full-time living as a butterfly collector. But as a teacher all I needed was butterflies: with them my students learned all about genetics, taxonomy, camouflage, evolution, physics, life and death ...'</p> <p>It is this kind of knowledge that she hopes the big cocoon will inspire. 'It's there to encourage a next generation of scientists, to prove that we are not boring men with lab coats or girls with awful glasses.'</p> <p>That may be the future but, for the time being, the closest the museum gets to proper interactivity is in the broom-cupboard office of the Insect Information Service. Stuart Hine sits surrounded by matchboxes and jiffy bags full of unusual creepy-crawlies that the great British public have found under their pillows or in their sock drawers. He and a colleague deal with about 4,000 such enquiries a year, plus a lively line in identifying refugees in imported foodstuffs: black widows in banana boxes, tarantulas in orange crates.</p> <p>Hine goes through his unusual in-tray. They have had a run on hornets ever since the BBC did a documentary about a giant oriental species, and everyone believes they have found one. In one bag is a bee with hairy feet - 'a hairy-footed flower bee'. And there is a strange collection of what look like dried dates: 'A chap in a jungle in India was recovering an engine from a Spitfire that crashed in the war and they discovered these - pupa cases from solitary bees.'</p> <p>Sometimes Hine is called to the front desk to be confronted with a live scorpion someone has found in their shoe after a holiday. Once, a man brought in something he'd found on his person in Richmond Park. Hine had to sit him down to explain it was a parasitic crab louse.</p> <p>Often it seems he is the 'go to' man for the whole world's bugs. 'We get in fruit flies that can devastate a whole country in the developing world, and because of the expertise here and the breadth of the collection, no one else can help - though these things evolve so fast that often they're new even to the specialists here.'</p> <p>At the other end of the scale there are plenty of regulars. 'A few old ladies with a bit of time on their hands will call to say, \"Ooh Stuart, I've found another one.\"' Whatever the enquiry, Hine clearly loves every minute of it. 'There are 23,500 insects and spiders in Britain and no one knows all of them, but I know most.' His purpose, and the purpose of the museum is clear. 'My single mission in life is to make people more aware of the life around them. It mystifies me that people are interested in what's on Mars when all of this stuff is at their feet to be handled and touched.'</p> <p>It feels very much like a quiet crusade, all of this; in fact just the kind of determined crusade, carried over four centuries, that might evolve a giant cocoon that will soon contain more of the planet's DNA than any other building on earth.</p> <h2>The curators</h2> <p><strong>Blanca Huertas, curator of butterflies</strong></p> <p>'I grew up in Bogota and when I was 12 I started collecting butterflies. By the age of 15 it was pretty much my obsession. I still go out into the field every six months. I don't go to research stations; I try to go to the really wild places. We have had a project since 2003 in Colombia, but now the drug gangs are there so it is a bit harder to go.</p> <p>You don't know immediately in the field that you have found a new species, but you have a good idea. You definitely start to be suspicious - it is something new, and sometimes: 'bingo!' Some people auction names of new butterflies to fund their collections, but we don't do that.</p> <p>I love the fact you can explain everything with them. It is quite hard in Columbia to earn a full-time living as a butterfly collector. But as a teacher I could explain everything with butterflies: genetics, taxonomy, camouflage, life and death.'</p> <p><strong>Martin Hall, forensic entomologist</strong></p> <p>'I get called in when the timing of death becomes an issue in a murder case. You collect maggots from the body and check their size, work out their gestation and correlate it against likely temperature. A crime scene is not a controlled environment, but within a range I can usually get to an answer. During the summer flies find the body very quickly and the process is speeded up.</p> <p>We just got a big grant from the government to get some imaging equipment that will allow us to look more closely at specimens, so we can collect more unusual visitors to a wound. The great thing here is that I can call on all the staff to help me to identify something. There is always someone who knows, even if I don't. It's not a new art though. There is evidence of forensic entymology being used in China in the 14th century. The suspects were lined up and the flies began to settle on the sickle of man who had committed the murder.'</p> <p><strong>Mark Spencer, curator of British and European herbariums</strong></p> <p>'One of the problems with the current building is that we have a 45C annual temperature range, which makes it hard to preserve the plants. The most ever-present danger are the little beetles. They love the daisy family and the carrot family; they'd happily munch through the entire collection. We are creating a pest-controlled environment in the cocoon - but beetles are cunning, and a few will no doubt get in.</p> <p>What I try to get across to people is the scale of the threat British plants are facing. The talk of the biodiversity crisis is not restricted to the Tropics. Take the stinging nettle, up until the late 18th century it was a very patchy and localised plant; but stinging nettles love nitrogen, and now because of the use of nitrate fertilisers their levels have gone through the roof. Two hundred years ago your average British ditch would have been full of a huge diversity of plants. That has all gone. Now it's full of nettles.'</p> <p><strong>Jan Beccaloni, curator of arachnids</strong></p> <p>'I look after all the things with eight legs, two body parts, no wings and jaws. The larger scorpions tend to be a wonderful kind of British racing green colour, but they lose that when they are dead. The best thing about them is that they fluoresce.</p> <p>It makes collecting them so easy. Once, we went out at night in South Africa and just held up a UV light and we saw them all running up trees and across the ground. Oddly, I'm a bit scared of the dark, and you have to be careful that when looking for scorpions you don't tread on something really unpleasant, that doesn't fluoresce, like a snake.</p> <p>Aside from the scorpions it's the big spiders that really take my fancy. But I'll have a go at anything really. I've been doing some work with the mite collection lately. It's one of those classic jobs - 'What did you do at the office today, darling?' 'Actually I spent the afternoon measuring a mite's anus.' But then my husband is the curator of cockroaches, so he's used to it. We tend to go on holidays to places where we can collect specimens - sometimes you feel you don't really need to leave your hotel room to get a good range of things.'</p> <p><strong>Steve Brooks, researcher in midges and climate change</strong></p> <p>'I've spent the past 15 years identifying the heads of midge larvae taken from the sediment in lakes and, with a knowledge of the environments different midges favour, looking at how the temperature has changed - with an accuracy of about one degree centigrade.</p> <p>We concentrate on the last 2.5m years. We know from the midges, for example, that the temperatures in Scotland fell by 5C in five or 10 years before the last Ice Age</p> <p>My real passion, though, is dragonflies. Ever since I can remember I have loved them. I used to go out pond dipping with my dad in Coventry and I got into the larvae mainly because they are really mean and they will eat anything you put in a container with them. I quite liked that. The adult emerging is a wonderful transformation that you can witness on your windowsill in the early hours of the morning. Oddly, these days things are actually looking up for dragonflies - climate change has definitely benefited them.'</p>",
  "<p>Wasps endured a torrid start to their Guinness Premiership title defence with London Irish emerging easy winners from the season's curtain-raiser at Twickenham.</p> <p>The champions' frailties at the lineout were exposed by Chris Hala'ufia and Richard Thorpe who crossed for Irish after capitalising on errors at the set-piece. Ian McGeechan's side are traditionally slow starters - last season they left their revival later than ever - and today they were off the pace and shapeless in attack. </p> <p>Irish were left reeling after finishing seventh last term, a position which meant they missed out on qualification for the Heineken Cup, but their rout at Twickenham was an impressive declaration of intent. They were a far more threatening side, showing a creative spark in attack matched by a tigerish work ethic in the loose which left Wasps living off scraps.</p> <p>Australian full-back Peter Hewat finished the afternoon with 16 points, successfully completing every kick at goal, and his haul ultimately proved the deciding factor. Final-quarter tries from Tom Rees and Eoin Reddan gave the score respectability but Hewat's boot meant the outcome was never in doubt.<br>The Experimental Law Variations have been the main talking point in the build-up to the season and one of the new rules was in evidence as Wasps paid the price for dropping numbers at the lineout.</p> <p>They used two less players in the sixth-minute set-piece and looked on in horror as Richard Birkett's attempted catch deflected into the hands of Hala'ufia who burrowed over from close range. But the Tongan number eight was quickly transformed from hero to villain when he was caught tripping Reddan at a free-kick and was dispatched to the sin bin.</p> <p>Hewat slotted a penalty to add to his earlier conversion, nudging Irish 10-0 ahead, after showing a neat side-step to open Wasps' defence. Conditions were slippery with a fresh downpour making play even trickier as England number eight James Haskell dropped a quick tap free-kick to emphasise the point.</p> <p>Player coach Mike Catt, starting at fly-half in place of the injured Shane Geraghty, showed smart reactions to set up a chance for Topsy Ojo but the England winger ran out of space. Irish maintained the pressure and were rewarded with another Hewat penalty but soon breathed a sigh of relief when Riki Flutey dropped the ball just short of the line after dancing through two tackles.</p> <p>Poor hands were also responsible as a daring Exiles breakout from their own 22 ended inches short of Wasps' whitewash with Sailosi Tagicakibau guilty of taking the wrong option. The champions' problems at the lineout proved costly once again in the 54th minute when Thorpe came up with the ball before swatting aside a poor tackle from Tom Voyce to cross.</p> <p>Rees got Wasps off the mark as the match entered the final quarter, showing initiative to scamper through a static defence.

  "<p>The mother of millionaire businessman Christopher Foster today spoke of her grief and shock at the loss of her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. </p> <p>In a short statement issued by West Mercia Police, Enid Foster said she could not condone the actions of her son, who killed his wife and daughter before taking his own life at their mansion in Maesbrook, Shropshire. </p> <p>Foster, who lives in south Shropshire, said her son had not talked to anyone about his financial troubles, and may not have been able to face telling his family that they were to lose their home. </p> <p>In the statement Foster, who is thought to aged 78, also paid tribute to her \"beautiful\" granddaughter Kirstie, 15, and said she was finding it hard to understand how her son could have done what he did. </p> <p>Foster said: \"I can't condone what he's done, but I've lost a dearly-loved son, daughter-in-law and beautiful granddaughter. </p> <p>\"He talked to nobody, we knew nothing about his financial situation and it's come as a tremendous shock. So many of his friends have told me that, had they known, they would have helped him however they could. </p> <p>\"They were a very close, loving family unit and I don't think he could face telling them they were going to lose everything, but I am in no way condoning what he's done. It's very hard.\" </p> <p>Mrs Foster also recalled how Kirstie had \"absolutely loved\" her horses and was an excellent rider. \"Kirstie was just a lovely girl,\" she said. \"Kirstie took part in the Berriew Show the weekend before. Her last ever show and she got first place in the championship.\" </p> <p>Foster, who has another son, Andrew, concluded her statement by saying: \"Life will never be the same without them. We're finding it very difficult to come to terms with.\" </p> <p>Police confirmed earlier this week that they believed Christopher Foster, 50, killed himself after killing Kirstie and his wife, Jill, and setting fire to their \u00a31.2m home and its outbuildings. </p> <p>Jill Foster, 49, was shot in the head, and the cause of Kirstie's death has yet to be established.</p>",
  "<p>Immigrant families in Britain often have very rigid ideas about what constitutes a respectable career path for their sons and daughters, according to Nesrine Malik in her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/31/careerseducation.immigrationandpublicservices\">article for Cif</a> a few days ago. As a result, she says, students of Asian origin tend to opt for science subjects rather than the arts in the belief that this will lead them to \"a proper job\" - and sacrifice a broadening of their horizons in the process.</p> <p>As a young woman from a Pakistani background who took a degree in English literature with the full support of my parents and extended family, I think Nesrine has missed several points. My mother and uncle are both writers, and most of my cousins (who hail from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India) are studying for arts degrees. Yes, we are from a fairly affluent and liberal background, but I think this illustrates that generalising solely along cultural lines is inaccurate and misleading. Views of education are more likely to be determined by social background than race or religion: surely in every culture, enlarging the mind by education for its own sake is a luxury traditionally enjoyed only by the privileged few \u2013 or not, since they have the freedom to decide.</p> <p>Nesrine describes teenagers on a Muslim mentoring scheme who immediately ask her how much she earns, and argues that this is indicative of a materialistic attitude to education. It certainly is, but I'd be willing to bet that white teenagers from the same disadvantaged area would share this emphasis upon earnings as a marker of success, and education as a means to attain it. A recent episode of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/S/secret_millionaire/index.html\">The Secret Millionaire</a> showed an unsuspecting teen tearaway telling the disguised millionaire that he had no authority as a youth adviser because \"you're not earning lots of money \u2013 I've seen your car\". </p> <p>In fact, among some white working class people, education is seen as a luxury. A schoolfriend of my brother, for example, was told by his family in no uncertain terms that staying on at school for A-levels was not an option because he had to start paying rent. This is by no means uncommon. As far back as 1965, Douglas and Kahl, in <a href=\"http://www.sociology.org.uk/revtece1.htm?tece1ec.htm\">Some Measures of Academic Orientation</a>, argued that white working-class children were less interested in education than their middle-class peers as they were encouraged to leave school as soon as possible to begin earning. This was termed \"immediate gratification\". Middle-class parents tended to offset the delay in income with the social standing that comes with a degree.</p> <p>This is not to say that we haven't moved on since the 1960s. It's certainly true that the expansion of the higher education system since the 1950s has resulted in wider access to a university education. One could even argue that the government's emphasis on \"education, education, education\" as an end in itself is starting to filter down as, increasingly, it is being a graduate that matters, regardless of the discipline. But it's important to remember that no such change has taken place in the developing world, where access to any kind of higher education remains very limited.</p> <p>The emphasis on an education that leads to a universally respected career is, for immigrant families, a gateway to cultural integration: finance, medicine, the law. Recent immigrants, unlikely to be highly educated themselves, will in general want three things: for their children to take advantage of the opportunities which they did not have, to use this for social mobility, and to erode their sense of otherness by becoming part of western society (while retaining a sense of their own heritage).</p> <p>The focus on the practical facets of education, then, is not evidence of inherent cultural narrow-mindedness, as Nesrine seems to have it, but is largely born of necessity and pragmatism. Across different cultures, education is a tool for success, and gaining a qualification in accountancy or medicine is a much clearer path to that success than an arts degree. While it's true that it's possible to gain a degree in the arts and go on to do a subsequent qualification in law or finance, the extra years of fees, debt, and no income are simply not feasible or appealing to those from a family without spare cash, regardless of their religion or culture. Just as Douglas found in 1965, an immediate professional qualification provides a fusion of the social mobility afforded by education and the gratification of a definite income at the end of it.</p> <p>I find the article's suggestion that Asians and Arabs consider the study of the arts or literature evidence of \"perturbingly unique thought that breeds moral suspicion\" profoundly worrying. This implies religious undertones in Asian attitudes to education, perpetrating a dangerous conception that Islamic countries oppress freedom of thought in every way. I dispute this. While culturally it might not be so much the norm to study say, literature or history as it is in the UK, those who pursue literary, religious, or political study are not morally suspect. In fact, in some families such study, particularly in fields relating to their own culture, such as Arabic or Urdu literature, are a source of great pride as integration is fused with a connection to one's own culture. My extended family, who are all practising Muslims, have expressed nothing but pride at my English degree, and far from being suspicious about my morality, have encouraged my interest in the arts, forcing family friends to read every article I've written.</p> <p>The pursuit of purely academic study has a lot more to do with social positioning, family background, and income than with religion or skin colour. So, yes, those from a South Asian background will often gravitate towards solid professional qualifications. However, this decision-making process tends to be influenced by socio-economic factors rather than moral ones, just as the lower proportion of white working-class teenagers studying to degree level has little to do with a repressive morality. Asians or Arabs of a certain class who choose to pursue purely academic study are not condemned as outcasts: they would simply be viewed with the same confusion as a young white man from a Peckham estate who decided to dedicate three years to the study of Renaissance verse.</p>",
  "<p>The 2008 Paralympics got underway in Beijing with a dazzling opening ceremony in the Bird's Nest stadium.</p> <p>The three-hour long ceremony, focusing on themes of time, space and life is expected to feature 6,000 performers and 4,000 disabled athletes from 148 countries. Britain's team of 206 athletes was led into the stadium by flag-bearer Danny Crates, who won gold in the 800m in Athens four years ago. Organiser Wang Wei said: \"We present two Games of equal splendour as a solemn commitment to the entire world.\"</p> <p>China welcomed world leaders to the ceremony, eager for another chance to cement its role as a global player to an international audience. The guest list included Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, German president Horst Koehler and South Korean prime minister Han Seung-soo. They shook hands and posed for photos with Chinese president Hu Jintao at the Great Hall of the People, the seat of China's legislature in Beijing before Hu gave a brief speech and toasted the Games.</p> <p>\"Caring for the disabled is an important symbol for social civilization and progress,\" Hu said before raising his glass. \"China's people and government have always attached great importance to the cause of the disabled. We insist on putting people first, carrying forward a humanitarian spirit and advocating equality and opposing discrimination.\" </p> <p>Opening just two weeks after the Beijing Olympics ended, the Paralympics are designed to be a parallel games for athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. The 10-day competition begins Sunday and will run until September 17, featuring 20 different sports and and 472 medal events - 170 more than the Olympics.</p> <p>China is keen to use the Paralympics to underscore what it says it has done for the country's 83 million disabled citizens. The official Xinhua News Agency said Beijing used much of its $100m budget for the Paralympics to improve handicapped facilities in competition venues, airports, the public traffic system, hotels, hospitals and tourist attractions like the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. An editorial on the front page of the ruling Communist Party's People Daily newspaper hailed the Games as a \"stage for the world's handicapped people to realize their dreams.\" </p> <p>But the country has also had a contentious history with dealing with its disabled population. The government has long advocated sterilising mentally handicapped people. In the early 1990s, a draft law was presented to the legislature to reduce the number of disabled through abortion and sterilisation, a move that unleashed international criticism. In 1994, China ratified a law calling for the abortion of foetuses carrying hereditary diseases and restrictions on marriages among people suffering mental problems or contagious diseases.</p> <p>More recently, Beijing Olympic organisers issued an apology in June for clumsy stereotypes used to describe disabled athletes in an English-language manual compiled for thousands of volunteers. One section described the physically disabled as \"isolated, unsocial and introspective; they usually do not volunteer to contact people. They can be stubborn and controlling.\"</p>",
  "<p>As Gordon Brown's tribulations mount, prompting among other things a reappraisal of his time at the Treasury, it is perhaps not surprising that even his most widely-celebrated policy innovation \u2013 the \"independent\" central bank \u2013 should <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/05/economics.economy\">come under scrutiny</a>. What is even more surprising, however, is why it was almost universally believed to be such a good thing in the first place.</p> <p>The independent central bank was seen as an important weapon in the monetarist armoury. Monetarism is, after all, an expression of an extreme belief in the infallibility of the market \u2013 an article of faith for New Labour. Governments cannot be allowed to intervene since any such intervention will frustrate the market's unfettered operation. What could be more natural, therefore, than to ensure that elected politicians are excluded from the formulation of monetary policy?</p> <p>This is not, of course, quite how the independent central bank is presented to the public. The public have been sold on the idea that an independent bank is necessary if inflation is to be controlled, since politicians cannot be trusted to take the hard decisions that are necessary. But a careful study of the recent history of the battle against inflation suggests that it has very little to do with the independence or otherwise of the central bank. Inflation in the 1970s was a worldwide phenomenon, but by the mid-1980s \u2013 reflecting world conditions \u2013 it had largely been brought under control. The claim that an independent central bank is essential if inflation is to be controlled in any case looks less convincing today, with inflation running at over 4%. </p> <p>But what is really remarkable about an independent central bank is that it is a major step away from democratic government. The price we pay, in other words, is not just an economic one, but is a significant weakening of our democratic institutions. What is identified as the over-riding issue in economic policy is now the exclusive preserve, not of elected governments, but of unaccountable officials. </p> <p>How this has been accepted is even more of a mystery when one considers that the \"independent\" central bank is in no sense objective or neutral. It is a bank. Its main clients are banks. It is staffed by bankers. It can be relied upon always to put the interests of the financial establishment ahead of those operating in the rest of the economy. Our economic policy is, in a very real sense, made in the interests of the holders of existing assets rather than of those who live and work in the real economy where new wealth is created.</p> <p>This bias seems more extreme the longer one looks at it. Not only has the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/overview.htm\">Monetary Policy Committee</a> ensured that the productive sector should bear the burden of its counter-inflationary measures but it seems also to have deliberately averted its gaze from the factor that really is the primary cause of inflation \u2013 the huge rise in bank lending. </p> <p>How have we arrived at this remarkable situation? It is not surprising that the bankers themselves should support and welcome it. Economists, too, will naturally feel that the authority and credibility of their profession have been underpinned by this recognition that it is only the high priesthood that is competent to address these important issues.</p> <p>But why have politicians so readily accepted this substantial diminution of their powers? The answer is that it is very convenient for politicians to be able to contract out the most difficult decisions they are faced with. How useful it has been for ministers to be able to pin responsibility on the Bank and to claim that the travails of the economy are caused by the mechanistic workings of the market and of essential monetarist disciplines rather than actual policy decisions.</p> <p>But is it not time that we reminded them of their responsibilities? If they want to exercise power in a democratic society, they should not be allowed to pick and choose which responsibilities they accept. </p> <p>There is, of course, an important role for an effective central bank. A central bank is essential to maintain a proper prudential supervision of banks and of the financial sector more generally \u2013 something that has been sadly missing from the scene over recent years. A central bank will regulate and enable the banks to interact in an efficient way that benefits the economy as a whole. The central bank will be an important source of advice on financial matters. But none of this requires the central bank to be immune from challenge or that its actions should be free from debate and discussion, particularly when it is uniquely entrusted with the power to give expression to a narrow and bank-dominated view of the true purpose of economic policy. </p> <p>The growing economic crisis demands that sacred cows should no longer be immune. Even in New Zealand, where the modern fashion for an \"independent\" central bank first surfaced, the debate is being re-opened. If we want an economy that more faithfully serves the interests of all of us, and not just those of a small, self-interested minority, economic policy should be restored to the democratic arena.</p>",

Walcott zips down the right immediately and slides the ball across into the six-yard area. Lampard and Defoe go in for the ball but Koldo gets there first. At which point Defoe's boot connects with the keeper, causing a minor melee involving about ten players. \"Please stop it, you gaggle of dim goons, you're all grown men,\" the referee should say, but doesn't.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Another fine piece of play by Walcott, who uses his pace and no little strength to get ahead of Txema down the inside-right channel and lift a shot over Koldo... and over the bar. A bright start from Walcott.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> A hilarious game of knee pinball is played out in the Andorra box. Eventually the ball breaks out towards Johnson, whose rasping shot is deflected wide. What follows is a perfect English corner, in the sense that it's hoofed witlessly over everyone's head, causing no danger whatsoever. \"Re Mac's point,\" begins Gary Naylor, \"I'm glad to see that England are not complacent about their fear of failure.

It's hard to believe, isn't it.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Ah yes, patience. John Terry takes the initiative and attempts a Steven Gerrardesque raking 40-yard crossfield pass to Ashley Cole on the left. It's a perfect facsimile of a Gerrard ball, as it flies into the stands about ten yards over Cole's head. Patience!</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Andy Murray, already one set up against Rafa Nadal in the semi-final of the US Open, has just served out to take the second set to a tie-brea... hold on, I'm supposed to be watching the football... England win a corner, Barry's long pass forward pinging off Andorra. The corner comes to nothing, but Terry does his bit by nutting Tony Lima by accident. Hold on, wasn't Tony Lima a golfer who died in an air crash in the 1960s?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Rooney has a slash from 20 yards; it's high, wide and very, very useless. \"Is it a fear of failure or are they just not very good at what they do?\" wonders Mark Judd. \"Discuss.\" I'm staying out of this.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Walcott has been bodychecked by Tony Lima. He stays down for a couple of minutes, but eventually gets up. There really isn't a lot to report, I'm so very sorry.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> This is a thundering non-event, another extremely flat performance by England. Who, for all their possession, haven't created much of note against the team ranked 183rd in the world.

Defoe, standing in the D, swings a boot at it and flays it way over the bar. This is far from impressive.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Here, I've forgotten to tell you how badly Frank Lampard is playing. I'm not sure if he's touched the ball once. Still, I'm not going to upbraid him for it, not while Paul Silton can do the job: \"Can you please ask any Chelsea fans out there if it is just televised matches that Frank Lampard goes missing in, or is he not that fussy?\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Credit where credit's due, though. Lampard takes a corner from the left: it's deep, and very dangerous indeed, finding Lescott at the far post. The central defender heads the ball neatly back into the path of Barry, who screws his shot wide left when it was surely easier to score. Fantastic dead-ball delivery from Lampard, and so nearly the first goal.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> As Downing swings a terrible cross through the area and out of play, Rooney almost breaking his neck to watch it sail out of play, the boos begin to ring out from the England end.

Joe Cole replaces Downing, while Emile Heskey replaces Defoe.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>46 min: </strong> Heskey's first contribution is to clatter into Pujol and concede a free kick. Seconds later Barry bowls the same player over. This is supremely witless.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>48 min: GOAL!!! Andorra 0-1 England.</strong> Silva upends Johnson - booking. The free kick is sent into the area from the right by Lampard, guided back across the face of goal by Lescott to Joe Cole, who is in acres and wallops the ball high into the net. Three minutes, that took him. He's well within his rights to look pleased, but the same can't be said of the players hugging him, none of whom have the decency to look sheepish or ashamed.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>51 min: </strong> Now Marcio picks up a yellow after tugging away on Heskey's shirt in the centre circle.

Andorra 0-2 Joe Cole.</strong> A lovely goal, this, straight down the middle of the pitch. Barry slips the ball along the ground to Rooney, who immediately helps it further down the pitch, splitting the Andorra back line and releasing Joe Cole in the box. He makes no mistake in forcing the ball past the advancing Koldo and into the net. This is quite a substitution, two goals in nine minutes. The rest of them want to hang their heads in shame.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>57 min: </strong> Tony Lima is booked for asking the referee to caution Heskey. Why? I have no idea, nor any desire to wing it.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>61 min: </strong> Poor Glen Johnson: from the right-hand side of the area he hammers a low shot into the bottom left corner, threading the ball through about ten bodies but somehow missing them all.

James Austen, however, is in a pub where the satellite signal was lost for the vast majority of the first half. \"Only a few people have left; the punters remaining loyal in the teeth of frustration. My evening has become something of a scene from a wartime movie where small audiences huddle around a radio listening for news of victory.

Things would have to be very bad in your life at the moment for you to derive any sort of pleasure or contentment from two goals in nine minutes against Andorra.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>67 min: </strong> Andorra win a corner. From it, Lescott wrestles Tony Lima to the ground, which looks like a penalty to me. It's not given, though. \"Is Andorra a real place then?\" wonders Chris Taylor. \"I assumed it was one of those made up towns like Timbuktu, or Tipperary. Still, well done Joe Cole.

He passes two before the ball is whipped off his toe. It really isn't that pleasant an experience to watch Frank Lampard sashay, incidentally.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>80 min: </strong> To wild cheers, Lampard is taken off while Beckham runs on. Once again, Lampard looks far from happy at being taken off.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>83 min: </strong> Rooney tries to lift a cross from the right to Heskey at the far post, but it's woefully off target and sails out of play. Apart from helping on Barry's ball for Joe Cole's second goal, he has done absolutely nothing.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Beckham swings a free kick into the area from the left. Terry gets his head to it but can't keep the ball down, sending it miles over the bar from eight yards. This has been a lumpen display, though things could be worse.

The heady days of Georgi Kinkladze, Shota Arveladze and Temuri Ketsbaia are over. </p> <p>There is a notable name on the bench, however: Georgia are managed by the Argentinian H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper, who has previously managed in Italy and Spain and won five caps as a player.</p> <p>Obviously there's also been some political rumblings going on in the homeland of late, about which I don't know enough to comment and am intending not to mention further than suggesting you read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/06/worldcup2010qualifiers.georgia\">this interview with Irakli Klimiashvili from today's Guardian</a>, which is headlined \"The Georgian mentality is pride and defiance\", which says much.</p> <p>Still Georgia are ranked 77th in Fifa's comedy world rankings, with Ireland 38th. There's no riotous home support for either nation in Mainz just, presumably, some baffled FSV Mainz season-ticket holders wondering when J\u00f8rn Andersen's men are going to be taking to the field. It should be comfortable enough for Trapattoni's men.</p> <p>Feel free to email. The address is up there.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>4.43pm:</strong> The Press Association or, indeed, any of their newswire rivals, haven't deemed it important enough to provide us with the team line-ups for this one yet. But I'm hitting refresh a lot, and hoping that my toil will pay imminent dividends.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4.47pm:</strong> If it's any help, these were the \"probable\" teams printed in the paper this morning. I don't know how certain David Hytner was when he wrote that piece, but it's better than nothing, which is our other option.</p> <p><strong>Georgia </strong>(probable, 4-4-2) Loria; Lobjanidze, Khizanishvili, Kaladze, Shashiashvili; Menteshashvili, Kenia, Kobiashvili, Siradze; Iashvili, Mchedlidze.

The Reading midfielder, as expected, took the place of the injured Damien Duff in the only change to the side which ran out for last month's friendly in Norway. Wigan full-back Kevin Kilbane made his 49th consecutive competitive appearance wearing a protective mask over his fractured cheekbone. Georgia boss Hector Cuper made four changes to the side which beat Wales 2-1 last month, one of which saw AC Milan defender Kakha Kaladze return.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Anthemwatch:</strong> Although respectfully chuntered by the crowd, the Irish Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann (The Soldier's Song) is spanked by the operatic Georgian equivalent Tavisupleba, which translates as Liberty.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> The first email is in, and Oliver Parry bangs me to rights: \"'The heady days of Georgi Kinkladze, Shota Arveladze and Temuri Ketsbaia are over.',\" he says, quoting the intro. \"So Georgia these days have to persevere with such mediocre journeymen as Champion's League winner Kakha Kaladze of Milan? I think what you mean is the heady days of Georgian players that play in the UK are over.\" Yes. That actually is what I meant.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 mins:</strong> And we're off. Stephen Hunt gets himself into a promising position early on, but a despairing lunge from the Georgian centre back blocks him. The wires still haven't published the full team lists, and I'm too daunted by the prospect of typing out all the Georgian names. Bear with us another couple of minutes.</p> <p>\"Kevin Kilbane's making his 49th consecutive competitive appearance wearing a protective mask?\" says Mac Millings. \"After all that time, you'd have thought his cheekbone would have healed by now. He should see a doctor about that.\" Not my words, Mac. The words of Damien Spellman, PA Sport in Mainz.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins: </strong>AC Milan's Kakha Kaladze deals comfortably with a break down the left from Reading's Kevin Doyle. Meanwhile, protective masks for footballers have really come on leaps and bounds: Kilbane's is practically invisible, but for the white padding either side of his cheeks.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 mins: </strong>Georgia whip in a decent-ish cross from a left-wing free kick. Given gathers comfortably. No real shape to proceedings as yet, although a couple of hefty challenges from Georgia, most recently on Kilbane.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 mins: </strong>The Georgia No9, who I think is Iashvili although I don't know for sure because the team lists still haven't been published anywhere I can copy-paste them from, finds some room in the Irish box but drags a tame shot wide.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins: GOAL! Georgia 0 Ireland 1</strong><br>Splendid stuff from Ireland who take the lead with their first meaningful attack. Robbie Keane holds onto the ball on the edge of the box long enough for Aiden McGeady to take a dart outside him down the right. McGeady puts in a perfect first-time cross and Kevin Doyle is there to nod in from three yards. Easy.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>16 mins:</strong> And here's who's playing:<br><strong>Georgia:</strong> Loria, Lobjanidze, Kaladze, Shashiashvili, Kenia, Aleksidze, Iashvili, Kobiashvili, Khizanishvili, Odikadze, Menteshashvili.<br>Subs: Makaridze, Salukvadze, Siradze, McHedlidze, Asatiani, Mchedildze.</p> <p><strong>Rep of Ireland:</strong> Given, Finnan, Kilbane, O'Shea, Dunne, Whelan, McGeady, Steven Reid, Doyle, Keane, Hunt.<br>Subs: Kiely, Andy Reid, Miller, McShane, Delaney, Keogh, Murphy.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> The 18-year-old Georgian goalkeeper Loria gets his name in lights - a Channel 5 on-screen caption, at least - for a double save after an Ireland corner. He kind of flaps at the first effort, then makes a diving save somewhere near his penalty spot when Glenn Whelan drives one in from 30 yards. Ruchard Dunne skews his chance wide. Ireland then win another corner, which Loria catches as unconvincingly as a catch can be.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 mins: </strong>Giovanni Trapattoni is barking orders from the bench, although Ireland are already looking remarkably comfortable here, with the Georgian midfield struggling to control even the simplest ball. Aiden McGeady is finding plenty of space down the right.</p> <p>Mac Millings has a riff, and he's going to ride it: \"One of the keys to improving medical equipment, including face masks, is long-term use by patients; hence, after 49 consecutive cheek-protected appearances, Kevin Kilbane wears the world's most advanced invisible face mask. It's the face mask against which all others must now be judged.\" See 5.05pm update for part one. Although it might not be worth the scrolling time.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>29 mins:</strong> Steven Reid is pulling the strings in midfield and sends Stephen Hunt on a hurtle down the left. It's stopped in agricultural fashion by Khizanishvili, who picks up a yellow card for depositing Hunt on the turf. Reid steps up and sends a thundering grasscutter through the wall at Loria, who dives to his left and saves. Again, massively unconvincingly.</p> <p>From the high-brow end of the mailbox comes Gary Naylor: \"I know there's a bit of baggage with this statement, but as an Englishman, do I owe my country's two greatest victories in no small part to Georgians? I refer, of course, to the linesman of 1966 and the psychopathic General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of 1941 - 1945.\"</p> <p>And in the gutter: \"With all them Villies, its odd that Georgia can't get better penetration.\" Peering at the stars is Brian Foley.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>33 mins:</strong> Some good versatility here from Ireland who are actually looking like they have some genuine invention coming from their silver-haired manager. Hunt and McGeady are swapping wings and attacking with pace and Doyle is prowling the box. Good stuff.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Richard Dunne deals with two left wing crosses from Iashvili, the first time out-muscling Aleksidze in the air, and then getting in front of him to clear with his feet. Given untroubled, as he was moments later when Iashvili blasts one over the bar having left John O'Shea for dead.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Kenia, who has an agreeable name to the MBM reporter, cons the referee into awarding a free kick when Stephen Hunt slides in and takes the ball. It's about 40 yards out, centre. The free kick is thumped into the wall and off for a corner which, in turn, is wasted when Iashvili puts a free header over the bar from six yards. He's totally unmarked and should have buried that one.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>40 mins: </strong>If this isn't your thing, and you prefer former Bluebells and Commotions bassists live blogging on Scottish tennis sensations playing Spanish minotaurs in New York, then you <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/09/06/us_open_semifinal_nadal_v_murr.html\">could always follow Lawrence Donegan on Andy Murray's US Open semi-final</a>, which has just started.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Aiden McGeady is out left now, but isn't having muc joy over there. Georgia are now closing down much quicker than the slip-shod earlier stages. Kobiashvili finds the chance to charge forward, but Reid gets a toe in and Ireland clear.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45+2 mins:</strong> McGeady again goes on a scamper down the left but finds the 311th and 312th Georgia defenders just too many to beat on one dribble and is double-teamed out of it. Reid blasts the free kick to Frankfurt. And then peep, peep, peep: that's the end of a largely satisfactory first 45 in Mainz.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong> Colin Murray. Pat Nevin. David O'Leary. Channel Five. In better news, Murray has broken Nadal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half time:</strong> \"At the risk of displaying insufferable pedantry,\" begins Oliver Parry, who need not apologise to the loyal army of MBM pedants. \"I have to point out that the 'Russian linesman' that called Geoff Hurst's non-existent second goal in 1966, was Azerbaijani not Georgian. His name was Tofik Bakhramov and he is also revered in his home country, with the national football stadium named after him.\" To be repeated in pubs up and down the land tonight.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Peeeeeep. And we're off again. No substitutes at half-time, Georgia are playing in their traditional all white; Ireland all green. Georgia are kicking from left to right on this TV screen.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>49 mins: </strong>Thrilling intrigue from the pitch-side reporter, who, at half-time, thought Shay Given might be injured because Dean Kiely was called to the dressing room from the half-time substitutes' warm-up. Turns out, chuckle, chuckle, that Given had ripped his shirt and they couldn't find a replacement, meaning Kiely was going to have to give his up. But fear not, they found the replacement and that's the end of that non-story. On the pitch, Robbie Keane is fouled about 30 yards out, and the free-kick is bent into the box, forcing Loria in the Georgia goal to claw it clear. Ireland then have successive corners and the second one finds John O'Shea totally in the clear six yards out, but his hopeless header is over.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>52 mins: </strong>The former Chelsea striker Aleksidze leaps with John O'Shea and Richard Dunne at the back, but his is a hopeless Maradona impression as his handball is not only completely obvious, but directs it meekly into the ground.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>55 mins: Post! </strong>Inches away from 2-0 for Ireland, after Champions League winning defender Kakha Kaladze sends a woeful backpass trickling towards his keeper. Robbie Keane is on to it, rounds the keeper, but is off balance and at an acute angle as he tries to steer it into the empty net. It hits the post and pings out to Aiden McGeady, who drives his chance wide.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>60 mins: </strong>A couple of missed chances in the past ten minutes, then, for Ireland. O'Shea's was far the worst, but with one goal in four years for his country, no one can be surprised. The former Chelsea man Aleksidze is subbed for Georgia, replaced by David Siradze.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> OK, O'Shea is back in the good books after he makes a terrific interception when a cross comes pinging into the box and a Georgian striker is lurking with intent. O'Shea lurches forward and cuts out the danger. But Georgia are now looking far the brighter.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Richard Dunne manages to clear some more Georgia pressure with his rear-end as a long free kick goes into the far post, has the Manchester City man spinning hopelessly underneath it and it lands with Khizanishvili. His dab towards goal ricochets off the pirouetting Dunne and off for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>69 mins: </strong>Some trademark Robbie Keane whingeing - arms flailing in perceived injustice - is prompted by Aiden McGeady taking a tumble on the edge of the box. Nothing given but is doesn't matter because...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>70 mins: GOAL! Georgia 0-2 Ireland: </strong>Glenn Whelan finds plenty of space 30 yards out and has no other options but to have a speculative shy at goal. It's looking for all the world like a comfortable gather for the goalkeeper, but he only manages to scoop it into his own net in slapstick fashion.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> An Irish reveller, possibly with more alcohol in his blood than would allow him to drive legally in most countries, makes a mad dash for the pitch with a number of German stewards in hot pursuit. Cue much sanctimony from the commentary box, whistles from the crowd and super slo-mo of a man in an orange bib tumbling over an advertising hoarding.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>77 mins: </strong>Liam Miller is on for Kevin Doyle, and No5 is on for Iashvili for Georgia.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Espanyol's Steve Finnan is replaced by Maplins' Paul McShane. Stephen Hunt drifts into the Georgia box from the left, but can't pick out Robbie Keane with his cross. It's fairly pedestrian stuff now, with Ireland confident that they've done enough.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>82 mins:</strong> Asatiani comes on in place of Khizanishvili, a saving of five letters. Georgia have all the possession in midfield, but can't penetrate, Richard Dunne hacking clear when they do manage to lump the ball into the box.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Ireland are edging towards a comfortable victory, while England, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/06/worldcup2010qualifiers.englandfootballteam\">according to Scott Murray's minute-by-minute pre-match build up</a>, have gone with Joleon Lescott and Theo Walcott for their match against Andorra. Scotland earlier lost to Macedonia and now Northern Ireland have gone and got themselves beat by Slovakia. Andy Murray is a set up against Rafael Nadal.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>89 mins: </strong>Andy Keogh is on for Aiden McGeady, who was tireless until he got tired and went off. Kevin Kilbane clears what passes for danger in the Ireland box this match when he heads a deep cross clear. Three minutes of injury time.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>90+1 mins: </strong>Some too late for this now ping-pong in the Ireland box, ends with Richard Dunne hacking clear for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins: GOAL! Georgia 1-2 Ireland </strong>- Ah, yes, it's never too late to grab a goal against Ireland, as Kenia proves. The corner is low and not especially powerful, but somehow Kenia manages to take it, sidestep John O'Shea and thump it past both Shay Given and Paul McShane on the line.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins: Peep, peep, peep. </strong> That's it: it's over. Ireland try to capitulate right at the death but leave it <em>just</em> too late for a heroic collapse. It's 2-1, thanks to goals from Kevin Doyle and Glenn Whelan and Trapattoni is out of the traps with a win. Thanks for your emails.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 2pm. Scott will be here from 1.30pm. Although he just texted in to say his train was delayed, so make that 1.47pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.47pm:</strong> Tom Lutz wasn't wrong. How queer.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Oh how I love you, Lisa Gray, PA Sport Chief Scottish Football Writer, Skopje:</strong> \"There were no real surprises in George Burley's team selection for Scotland's World Cup qualifying opener against Macedonia.<br>Kenny Miller and James McFadden both started and were given the task of getting the goals despite a less than inspiring partnership in last month's friendly against Northern Ireland at Hampden. With West Brom's James Morrison injured, Barry Robson was given the nod in midfield alongside Celtic team-mates Paul Hartley and Scott Brown, as well as Darren Fletcher. As expected, stand-in skipper Stephen McManus was able to shake of a knock he picked up in last week's Old Firm derby to take his place in the heart of defence with Gary Caldwell. Kirk Broadfoot was named among the substitutes after his surprise call-up earlier in the week.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>At last, they bother to send the teams through, though I can hardly bang on about other folk being tardy this afternoon. Anyway, FYR Macedonia: </strong>Milosevski, Noveski, Petrov, Sedloski, Mitreski, Lazarevski, Georgievski, Shumulikoski, Maznov, Pandev, Naumoski.<br>Subs: Pacovski, Polozani, Tasevski, Demiri, Trajanov, Grncarov, Ristic.</p> <p><strong>Scotland:</strong> Gordon, Alexander, Naysmith, McManus, Caldwell, Hartley, Fletcher, Brown, Miller, McFadden, Robson.<br>Subs: McGregor, Boyd, Broadfoot, Maloney, Commons, Stewart, Berra.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Pavel Kralovec (Czech Republic)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The way I look at it is this:</strong> One of the Official Rules Of All Football is that Scotland are only ever any good when there is absolutely no expectation whatsoever. In fact, that's rule one. So I think it's only fair to note that the couple of wins against France in the Euro qualifiers - while wholly hilarious, mainly due to the petulant reaction of Tinyears Thierry - represented a couple of blips, rather than an upward trend that can be extrapolated to World Cup glory (see graph). Scotland have since been terrible, pretty much, so. There, if that doesn't guarantee a 6-0 win for the Scots, nothing will.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>The Macedonian national anthem:</strong> Is quite an amazing piece of music. It sounds like a haunting Norwegian folk anthem, the sort of thing a young girl sings when she finds out her father isn't coming back, there's been a disaster on the whaling boat. Fantastic stuff, a genuinely moving solo turn. There's quite an atmosphere in the stadium. The atmosphere of a hospital chapel, admittedly, but an atmosphere nonetheless.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Not much happening so far, though Gary Caldwell has already put in one reducer on Pandev. \"Sometime in the 17 minutes between when you were first expected and when you actually started,\" begins Gavin Speirs, setting the tone, though he really wants to have a pop at First Capital Connect, not me, \"bored of Jim Traynor's opinions and not interested in Craig Burley's, I noticed the qualifying table on the left of the page showing Macedonia top and Scotland bottom. Is this to set realistic expectations ahead of our dismal 2-0 defeat? Is it to give us the chance to say Kenny Miller's 53rd minute tap-in saw us beat the top team? Or has the alphabet been updated recently?\" You got it right first time, Gavin. The only way is up. That's the way we like it round here.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Scotland have started steadily enough, Hartley, Brown and Fletcher seeing plenty of the ball. Ah hold on, McManus has just taken Maznov down five yards from the area. Damn. \"Thanks for trying with the Official Rules, Scott,\" writes Billy Clark. \"All was going well with that comment until you went and predicted a 6-0 win at the end of it. We're doomed. Doomed, I tell ye!\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min: DOOMED! Macedonia 1-0 Scotland.</strong> Well Billy Clark called that one damn straight. Sedloski hammers a low shot towards the bottom left corner which Gordon does wonderfully well to fingertip onto the post. The luck's not with him, though, the ball bouncing straight back, allowing Ilco Naumoski to sidefoot home from three or four yards. Whoosh! There goes that World Cup!</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Five minutes, that campaign lasted.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Right, the comeback is on! Scotland win a free kick 25 yards out, just to the right! Robson tries to replicate Sedloski's daisycutter... but you couldn't slice through melted butter with the weak effort he dispatches into Milosevski's arms. The comeback is not on!</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Jinking Genius James McFadden fiddles around down the right touchline. It's pretty, but he's going nowhere, just like the rest of them. \"My nerves are shot, Burley has to go,\" announces Chris MacFarlane. \"He's had 10 minutes already.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> A majestic piece of thuggery from Caldwell, who has clearly been watching Kirk Broadfoot at close quarters in training. He slides in late on Pandev - about 20 minutes late, and halfway up his leg. He's a very lucky lad not to pick up a yellow for that. It was more clumsy than malicious, though.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> \"That Macedonian anthem is a real tubthumper,\" agrees Al O'Neill. \"It's bound to get 'em all going - to a darkened room with a nice new set of razor blades.\" Interestingly enough, it is Scotland who look thoroughly depressed at the moment. They can't get hold of the ball at all. I miss the tactical nous of Alex McLeish, that it's come to this.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Shumulikoski has a dig from 25 yards out. It flies way right and is utterly harmless, but Macedonia were allowed acres of space in midfield there. Scotland need to get their gamefaces on, and quick, because after a bright start which lasted, ooh, three minutes, they have been pretty abject here.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Maznov nearly latches on to a long hoof in the Scotland area, but McManus eases him out of the way. That's good defending, because that looked dangerous for a split second.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Robson has looked pretty lively, though, I guess, and here he twists and turns, back and forth twice, down the wing, like a Scottish Garrincha, to win a corner. Nothing comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Naumoski is afforded the entire Scottish half, running onto another raking upfield punt. What on earth was Naysmith doing there? Caldwell comes across to mop up, but again, for a while that looked dangerous. Again. If there's going to be another goal soon, only one team look like scoring it.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Pandev twists and turns down the wing, like a Brazilian Garrincha rather than a Scottish one. The difference is instructive, because when he crosses from the right into the centre, it needs a desperate pair of eyebrows from McManus to glance a header away with Maznov waiting to crash a header home from six yards. Scotland are now officially All Over The Shop.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Shumulikoski is yellow-carded for flipping Fletcher into the air like an egg. He should have been congratulated for that, because he has reminded everyone that the Manchester United \"star\" is indeed on the pitch. He joins Naumoski in the book, by the way, as the goalscorer had his name taken for the grave crime of being happy and celebrating his strike.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Scotland string a few passes together at last, but they're all across the back. The minute it's pinged forward, the ball is lost. Really, this isn't good enough.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>30 min: SCOTLAND DO SOMETHING UP FRONT!</strong> Don't get too excited, it's not much, McFadden picking up the ball to the right of the Macedonian box and dribbling across the area, before finally getting a low shot in on goal. Mitreski slides in to block the effort. There, that's a wee bit better.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Pandev goes in to challenge Gordon for the ball and dives over the keeper's hands, claiming a penalty. The referee is having not a bar of it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> This is terrible from the Scots. Utterly awful. They're doing nothing. I've got the funk on, right here. So it's just as well it's <strong>OPTIMISM TIME with Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Had Scotland scored that goal, we'd all be speculating that it had been scored too early and that Scotland wouldn't be able to hold out for 85 minutes. Can't we apply this logic in reverse? Thought not.\" That didn't have the required effect, really, did it.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Robson, taking his Celtic form into the international arena, has been Scotland's one shining light here. Again he jinks around a bit, this time straight down the centre of the pitch, and slaps another shot in on target. Straight at Milosevski admittedly, but at least he's doing something positive, which is more than can be said for the rest of the shower.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> A delicious Robson dinked pass down the left nearly sets Naysmith free, but he's harried out of it before he can send a cross towards Miller in the centre. Then Robson takes another shot. Then McFadden wins a corner down the right with a cross-cum-shot which causes Milosevski to fumble at his near post. Robson - can you sense that he's Scotland's star man? - takes two corners in a row, both which cause mild trouble in the area. This is much better.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> And sure enough, after playing their best few minutes of the match, Scotland nearly go 2-0 down, Maznov streaking clear only to be denied by a telescopic leg from Caldwell at the death, allowing Gordon to snaffle the ball into his arms. Gotta love Scotland and the joy they bring!</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Caldwell got away with a handball on the edge of the area there, as Naumoski nearly sets Maznov free with a clever pass. Macedonia look dangerous every time they come forward. \"Calm down, guys,\" writes Billy Clark. \"Surely the aim is to make things hard so we can show our great fighting spirit and come back to almost not lose in the last minute?\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> McFadden is lucky to escape a booking after wafting a leg in the general direction of Lazarevski's shin. He did, in fairness, cop one in the face from the aforementioned Macedonian defender's forearm, though it was unintentional. \"In all honesty,\" harumphs Chris McFarlane, \"considering Celtic have never so much as taken a point away from home in the Champions League, why are we starting with five of them in our opening away fixture?\" The dictionary definition of a fair point, well made.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min +1:</strong> DARREN FLETCHER HAS TOUCHED THE BALL! YES, HE REALLY HAS TOUCHED IT!!! He passes to Brown, who attempts to rake one in from 40 yards. Yep. \"I know why we are losing,\" writes David Thompson. \"The weather people in Macedonia said that it is almost 100 degrees there. It has been scientifically proven that the melting temperature of a Scotsman is 78 degrees, any hotter than this and our limbs go floppy and we cant run.\" Now do you fancy explaining away Scotland's record at sun-kissed Hampden?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half time: Macedonia 1-0 Scotland.</strong> Well that wasn't too far from terrible, not too far at all. Just to make it absolutely clear, Kenny Miller is indeed on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>The gospel according to Rev Stuart Campbell:</strong> \"For Gawd's sake,\" he begins, which looks suspiciously like taking His name in vain to me, \"leave off with the relentless negativity.\" Sorry. But you'll forgive me, right? \"Scotland have been woeful and look like they're playing in diver's boots in the tropical conditions, but we don't need it painted even worse than it is. Macedonia should never have had the free-kick for the goal, and the ball was nowhere NEAR Caldwell's hand on 41 mins. They're not actually any better than us, and there's definitely at least a point here for the taking.\" Fair points: 45 minutes of happiness coming your way. (Incidentally, for any fans of architecture out there, the Official theguardian.com Pulpit from which the Rev preaches is in the baroque style.)</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Several members of the Tartan Army are wearing amusing hats. Actually, one of them really is quite amusing, shaped like the sort of old-school kettle you'd stick on top of a hob, or perchance an Aga. I think it actually might be a real kettle. It's hard to tell, though, because it's tartan in colour. Is tartan a colour? No. Scotland force a corner immediately from kick off, by the way, a passage of play I missed because I was wittering on about Agas and tartan kettles. Apologies again, but what can you do? Anyway, the corner was wasted and easily cleared, so you've missed nothing.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Alexander battles well down the right. I reckon he wins another corner, besting Pandev in a tussle, but the Macedonian falls over and the referee awards the home side a free kick. This is a much more determined Scotland we've got here; hope they can keep it up for the next 43 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Another corner for Scotland. Robson swings it in from the right; it nearly flies straight into the top left corner of the net (think Kenny Dalglish v Ipswich in 1983/4) but Milosevski tips over. Hartley's effort from the other side causes less bother.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Much, much, much better from Scotland, and from Brown, whose career has stood still for the best part of the last year. He surges forward from the right, cuts inside, passes to McFadden and lashes the return goalwards. That's keeper's ball, but applause for the move. Is this the same man who was ambling around in a dizzy haze in the first half? Is this the same team? Scotland are making it very easy for me to keep Reverend Campbell happy.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> After another Brown surge down the right, Robson goes over a Macedonian leg in the area, but that's never a penalty. The ref agrees and play continues, the Tartan Army making incredulous sounds in the background.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>54 min: WHAT A MISS BY FLETCHER!</strong> Robson feeds Naysmith down the left. Naysmith's curling cross into the six-yard box is a peach, right on Fletcher's head, but somehow he fails to connect and the chance is gone. That should have been the equaliser. Fletcher has been referred to as Manchester United's Darren Fletcher every time he's touched the ball by Setanta's commentators, so it's quite instructive that when he cocks it up, he suddenly becomes \"the Scottish midfielder\".</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>56 min: WHAT A SAVE BY GORDON!</strong> Macedonia go straight up the other end and win a couple of corners. From the second, the ball drops to Shumulikoski, at the right-hand corner of the area. He unleashes a rising screamer which Gordon does amazingly well to tip over the bar. Such a fantastic save. After years of \"amusing\" jokes, England must be wishing they had a keeper as good as this. I wonder what Jimmy Greaves thinks about it all?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> After a decent start to the half, Scotland seem to have blown themselves out a wee bit. Meanwhile the Reverend Campbell is not going to like this rant from Peter Newlands: \"We've been absolutely shocking and I'm slightly embarrassed that we're seeded well above Macedonia. As a Celtic fan it's good to see as few Rangers players in the line up but McManus and Caldwell are two of the most shockingly bad centre-halves I've ever seen at Parkhead. I was at the old firm game and we could have just picked two guys out of the crowd, even out of the Rangers end, and they'd have played better. So good to see them both pulling on the white and horrendous baby blue saltire of Scotland.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Pandev is booked for diving over Caldwell's leg. Setanta's on-screen clock reads \"Mac 1-0 Sco\". I keep momentarily thinking Scotland are losing 1-0 to Macclesfield. It's not beyond the realms of possibility, though, is it.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> George Burley is screaming at Darren Fletcher, who knows why. He can't get his attention, though, screaming \"Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren! Darren!\" for what seems like ages. It is quite pitiful, reminiscent of Alan Partridge's Dan-related car-park meltdown.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Commons comes on for Hartley, and immediately gets a cross in from the left. It is terrible. Then Naysmith has a go, and nearly finds Fletcher in the centre, though given what Fletcher did with his last cross, you could forgive him for not bothering.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Trajanov comes on for the goalscorer Naumoski.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> After an incredibly impressive period of play from Scotland, half the team sweeping the ball left and right and back again along the front of the Macedonian box, McFadden and Miller burst into the box in tandem. And are both upended! First Miller goes over the leg of Mitreski, then McFadden is hauled down by the hands of Milosevski. Either could have been a penalty; neither are given. Scotland very, very unfortunate there.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> I still can't believe Scotland didn't get a penalty there. McFadden was booked for protesting, though you can hardly blame him for slipping into a boiling funk.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Petrov is down with cramp. Barry Robson - who has on the whole been excellent today - is replaced by Shaun Maloney. They're showing the non-penalty decisions again. Utterly outrageous.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Yet Scotland aren't helping themselves. Commons skins Petrov down the right, some truly fantastic skill tight on the touchline. He fires a low cross into the six-yard box, which is spilled by Milosevski, but nobody's there to sweep home because Miller, McFadden and Fletcher have all run in exactly the same direction, like Charles 'Charlie' Charles's Arsenal team in that Harry Enfield sketch.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Petrov, perhaps in shame at being skinned by Kris Commons, is replaced by Grncarov. A minute or so later, Miller buggers off and allows Kris Boyd, who is hilariously lazy but always seems to score, to come on.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Maloney is in miles of space down the right. Fletcher tries to find him but plays the ball about 10 yards behind the player. He starts throwing his arms around in frustration, Thierry Henry style.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Tasevski comes on for... er... erm...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> McFadden twiddles around down the left and scoots into the area, but his low cross is easily swept clear. Scotland are running out of ideas.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> As if to prove it, the ball is lumped towards Boyd, in the hope he'll win a header. Nope.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Hoof. Hope. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hoof. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hoof.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Maloney tries to catch Milosevski out with a quick free kick: everyone's expecting him to swing it in the area, but he fires towards the top-left corner. It's high and wide, but quick, clever thinking. Then a minute later he has a rasp from 30-plus yards. It was heading into the top right, but Milosevski parries wonderfully. Shame he didn't come on a bit earlier.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be four minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> Maloney then McFadden take turns to skidaddle down the left, but neither can deliver a killer cross.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Full time: Macedonia 1-0 Scotland.</strong> A much better second-half performance from George Burley's side - they should have had a penalty when Miller and McFadden were both taken down within the space of 0.0000045 seconds, but you make your own luck, and their first-half performance was a sorry shambles.

  "<p>A newcomer to British politics might be forgiven for imagining a wizard resides in the north. No, not Gordon Brown; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond</a>. The Scottish National Party leader's sleekit charm and verbal fluency have long wowed commentators who visit Scotland only during the Edinburgh festival. But since becoming first minister his magnetic effect on the naive has intensified to imitate that of the <a href=\"http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html\">Large Hadron Collider</a>. Regrettably, while the technology at Cern is feared but safe, Salmond is dangerous and widely admired.</p> <p>He relishes it, taking care to maintain his profile on network radio and television despite his ambition to take Scotland beyond its footprint. Readers familiar with the first minister's chameleon charisma will not be surprised that he even has a special Today programme accent, much less Banff than the one he deploys on Good Morning Scotland. </p> <p>But with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/scotland.snp\">proposal</a> to replace the council tax in Scotland with a new layer of income tax, clever Alex has taken a gamble that may expose the substance-vacuum at the core of <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/\">SNP politics</a>. Previous strokes of genius \u2013 what he calls \"making Westminster dance to a Scottish jig\" \u2013 have involved little more than allocating large sums of money to policies the UK government is honest enough to admit it cannot afford. <br> England could also have abolished student fees, reduced prescription charges and reduced business rates if another jurisdiction, Switzerland perhaps, was willing to subsidise it. But England does not have the luxury of being a devolved component of another state that grants it autonomy while continuing to pay its bills. Shame; it would be the answer to many prayers during our nasty new recession.</p> <p>Salmond's error is to pick a fight with Westminster over a proposed local income tax that is neither local nor democratic and which clearly ignores the law. The details are plain. Under the <a href=\"http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/devolution/\">devolution settlement</a>, local government is a devolved matter. Holyrood can reform local taxation if a majority of MSPs backs the plan. It cannot reform income tax, only vary the base rate by a maximum of 3p in the pound.</p> <p>With less than masterly sleight of hand Alex and his finance minister John Swinney have proposed using the power to vary income tax as a mechanism to reform local government finance. Their scheme would destroy local accountability because the tax would be set centrally, by Swinney, and not in council chambers by councillors. </p> <p>This is an abysmally centralising idea from a party that exists to prove that local communities should govern themselves. Granted, Scottish councils already get the majority of their income from central government, as do their English counterparts. But the power to set the council tax is what makes local democracy real. Without it, councillors become little more than middlemen, elected to do the will of central government even if they are elected on entirely distinct manifestos. </p> <p>Most democrats accept that the American revolutionary principle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_without_representation\">no taxation without representation</a> should also work in reverse: accountability cannot exist unless elected representatives have responsibility for the funds they disburse. Apparently Salmond does not.</p> <p>But of course that is not true. He demands the right to control central taxation in Scotland on exactly those grounds, but he cares not a whit for local democracy \u2013 only for the delicious confrontation with Westminster that is now looming. It is one he must lose. He is trying to declare the right to revise the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_1\">Scotland Act</a> unilaterally. No UK government of any complexion can tolerate that. It would amount to independence without consent.</p>",
  "<p>So England can win under the rain at Wembley after all. As was the case against Croatia in November, the heavens opened above north London's most famous football ground last night but this time there was no defeat, no despair and no wally with the brolly.</p> <p>Stuart Pearce's team toiled at times but ultimately deserved the outcome, one that moves them ever closer to next summer's European Championship in Sweden. A two-legged play-off in October awaits but, having finished top of their qualifying group and remained undefeated throughout, England will go into the tie confident of progressing.</p> <p>This was a commanding performance against a team widely viewed as one of the world's best at this level. Indeed, Portugal showed their class early on by moving the ball with a swiftness that set the pulse racing but, having survived that push, England took control and eventually the lead just before half-time thanks to James Milner's penalty.</p> <p>It was the 22-year-old's fifth goal of the qualifying campaign and it came at the end of a week during which the player has had to deal with the acrimonious switching of clubs. A clutch of other England youngsters, most notably Mark Noble and Steven Taylor, have experienced turbulence at their clubs and Pearce was full of praise for them afterwards.</p> <p>\"We played very well and I was particularly pleased the lads put into practice everything I asked of them in the build-up,\" he said. \"A lot has happened in football this week and some of my players have had to deal with that but they showed no disruption. There is no doubting we have a very good spirit in our dressing room.\"</p> <p>The most satisfied member of Pearce's squad could well be Gabriel Agbonlahor who recovered from a virus to play here and was rewarded for his efforts when he sealed the victory with a side-footed shot past Rui Patricio in the Portugal goal on 63 minutes. Other chances followed, most notably a drive from Noble in stoppage time that crept just wide of the post, but by that stage it was obvious England had done enough and the drenched crowd departed in celebratory mood.</p> <p>As did Pearce who, after joining up with the senior side for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers, will head to Malmo to see which team England will face in the play-offs. He should travel with no fear.</p>"
