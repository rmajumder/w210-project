  "<p>\"Ireland will soon be the abode of bliss, as it is now of loyalty.\" - Morning Post</p> <p>On Wednesday night upwards of two hundred misguided wretches, mostly armed, many of them mounted on horseback, surrounded the house of Mr. John Ives, a tithe-proctor, at Inchirourke, near Askeaton. After dragging him out of the house, they proceeded to administer oaths prohibiting him from interfering in tithe business; and while thus employed, a party of Mr. Going's police, consisting of seventeen sub-constables, approached the house, having received information that such proceedings would take place.</p> <p>On being challenged, and commanded to surrender, they commenced firing on the police. In that discharge, one of the police was shot dead. Mr. Doolan [chief police officer] ordered his party to fire in return and a regular volley obliged the assailants to break line, and disperse.</p> <p>A charge was then made by the police, who succeeded in taking three prisoners: two were also found dead. Many skirmishes occurred, in which sixty shots were fired by the police.</p> <p>Great numbers have been wounded and several dead bodies are concealed in the neighbourhood. Those found by the police were interred, without coffins. </p> <p>Another of the gang died last night in a hut on the mountain; he was shot through the abdomen. The roads in the neighbourhood of Askeaton present a most horrid appearance, streams of blood in various parts, and the different gaps across which the wounded were borne away, are all besmeared with blood. Many of [the horses] were dreadfully wounded.</p> <p>--------</p> <p>The preceding account will give our readers a tolerably correct idea of the \"bliss\" which pervades Ireland. Outrages and murders, not committed by a few skulking assassins, but in which the whole labouring population of whole districts is implicated; an utter contempt and defiance of the law on the one hand, and on the other, a perfect indifference as to the sufferings of a starving and degraded peasantry: these are the most prominent features in the present blissful condition of that ill-fated country.</p> <p>The King may visit Dublin, and carouse with its wealthy inhabitants; the Catholics and Protestants may decorate each other with ribbons and gew-gaws; the whole nation may \"stand prostrate\" before the Marquis of Londonderry; and the press of Ireland may out-vie the venal press of England in adulation and absurdity - but Ireland will still remain a poor, degraded, oppressed and distracted country.</p>",
  "<p>City authorities in St Paul had been preparing for this week's Republican national convention for almost two years. In expectation of 30,000 delegates and 15,000 members of the media, along with protesters, they had assembled the biggest police force in Minnesota's history, and worked out a complex programme of road closures. </p> <p>They had scrambled to help visitors deal with a desperate hotel room shortage, weeded 4,300 acres of parks, and cleared space in the county jail. But yesterday, as Hurricane Gustav approached the gulf coast, the city was waiting to discover if the event would bear any resemblance at all to the original plan.</p> <p>The Republicans' choice of St Paul - a city of fewer than 300,000 people that is dwarfed by its neighbouring twin city, Minneapolis - had been expected to bring up to $160m to the region.</p> <p>Much of that income boost may still materialise: although George Bush and Dick Cheney now seem certain to be absent, many of the politicians and journalists involved had arrived before disruption to the week's events became a serious possibility. </p> <p>\"It's the biggest thing that's happened in St Paul's 150-year history,\" former mayor George Latimer said.</p> <p>Plans for anti-Republican protests - and police efforts to thwart the possibility of violence - were also already underway.</p> <p>At the weekend, local police reportedly armed with semi-automatic rifles raided several houses and a building used by the RNC Welcoming Committee, an anarchist group that has pledged to disrupt the convention. Five people were arrested.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, yesterday defended his choice of running mate, Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, in the face of widespread scorn that she lacks experience, especially in foreign policy.</p> <p>Asked about her lack of experience on Fox News Sunday, McCain said: \"She's been commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard ... she's had judgment on these issues. She's had 12 years of elected office experience, including travelling to Kuwait.\"</p> <p>Republicans accused Palin's critics of being sexist in their readiness to dismiss her. The appointment of the social conservative as vice-presidential nominee, has been enthusiastically greeted by the party's rightwing.</p> <p><br>One of McCain's closest advisers, Senator Lindsey Graham, said she had more experience than McCain's presidential opponent, Barack Obama. \"She's been a governor ... that's more than Obama.\"</p> <p>Palin's appointment came as a surprise to Obama's campaign team, which immediately criticised her lack of experience. But Obama later changed the tone to politely welcome the historic nature of having the first woman on a Republican ticket. His campaign team dispatched staff to Alaska to look into her background, including her initial support for the state's expensive and infamous Ketchikan bridge, known better as the Bridge to Nowhere.</p> <p>Although opinion polls taken over the weekend are being eagerly awaited by both camps, Real Clear Politics, a website that tracks major polls and provides a running average, yesterday had Obama on 47% and McCain on 44%. In the battlefield states, Obama was ahead in Pennsylvania and McCain in Florida, with the two tied in Ohio.</p> <p>In a theme echoed by other Democrats throughout the day, Senator John Kerry, the failed Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2004, described Palin as having been picked to placate the Republican party's rightwing, which is suspicious of McCain. Kerry told ABC News: \"He's chosen somebody who doesn't believe climate change is man-made.\"</p> <p>He said it was insulting to Hillary Clinton supporters to suggest that Palin, given her anti-abortion and other socially conservative views, might woo them.</p> <p>The former Democratic Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, described the appointment as \"inexplicable\".</p> <p>But Rush Limbaugh, whose radio show attracts millions of rightwing listeners, enthusiastically welcomed her. \"Palin equals guns, babies, Jesus ... Obama just lost blue-collar, white Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and other states,\" Limbaugh said. James Dobson, the conservative Christian leader who had been opposed to McCain, said the selection of Palin had won him over. </p> <p>After appearing with McCain at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, on Friday, Palin made her second campaign speech on Saturday near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her stop in Pittsburgh showed a vulnerability that could be a worry for McCain. Some of the audience left as she was speaking and there was booing when, in an appeal to Democratic voters to switch to McCain, she mentioned Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the Republicans wheel out their latest asset, there is still disagreement on how to deploy one of their oldest: the incumbent president. As George Bush ends his second term in office, he has acquired the distinction among the general American population of being one of the most disliked presidents in history, alongside Harry Truman and Richard Nixon, with his popularity rating at about 28%.</p> <p>Although polls show that two out of three Republican loyalists still continue to think highly of Bush, the loathing with which he is now regarded by huge swaths of the country has a direct bearing on the re-election hopes of scores of Republican members of Congress in swing states. Unless Bush is kept in the shadows their jobs could be on the line in November.</p> <p>While part of the alliance of interests in the so-called Reagan coalition continue to adore the president, others are disillusioned by him. Top of the list of the disgruntled are the economic conservatives, for whom tight public spending, tax cuts and balanced budgets are key.</p> <p>Equally livid is the libertarian wing that has been an influential part of the movement since the 1960s. It defines conservatism as vesting power in the individual, free of government interference, but blames Bush for having extended the reach of Washington more than any other president since Lyndon Johnson. On the other side of the widening rift within US conservatism, the Christian right remains broadly supportive of the president.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 1 2008. We incorrectly gave the name of Senator Lindsey Graham as Senator Graham Lindsey. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Elliott is livid. The man who founded London listings magazine Time Out four decades ago is a long-time supporter of the BBC - but he now finds himself at war with a corporation he believes has stepped well beyond its boundaries with the \u00a375m acquisition of the rival travel guide publisher Lonely Planet. It's a fight that broke out spectacularly at last week's Edinburgh TV festival, where Elliott called publicly for the broadcaster's commercial arm BBC Worldwide to be broken up and sold, and he now intends to take his argument direct to parliament, as a committee of MPs prepares to scrutinise a deal that has infuriated the publishing industry.</p> <p>\"The Lonely Planet thing has clearly triggered a lot of people thinking 'What the fuck is going on at BBC Worldwide?' and they have started asking questions,\" says the 61-year-old publisher, seated in his office at the heart of Time Out's headquarters on Tottenham Court Road.</p> <p>Elliott, who has something of the ageing hipster about him, not least because of the flowery shirt he is wearing, is at the centre of a growing band of lobbyists who think BBC Worldwide is out of control - threatening to use the massive marketing and brand muscle the BBC has built up with licence fee money to pulverise commercial companies that operate in sectors far removed from the corporation's core business of TV and radio.</p> <p>\"I think the BBC is fantastic,\" he says. \"But I think that BBC Worldwide should be broken up. I think that things that they do which are a logical extension of the broadcasting side - selling the programmes or formats - should continue to exist and be part of the BBC, but all the other stuff should be sold off. My gut feeling is that may well end up having to happen.\"</p> <p>The catalyst, he hopes, will be the upcoming investigation into the BBC's commercial operations by the culture, media and sport select committee. Elliott, a compulsive hoarder who within seconds can put his hands on Time Out's forerunner, an arts magazine he edited at Keele University in the 1960s, is already preparing his extensive submission to put before MPs. \"I cannot believe that these people are going to say to the BBC 'just carry on',\" he says. Alongside Time Out will be Penguin, owner of the Rough Guide franchise, which has already tried - in vain - to get the BBC Trust to explain why it approved the deal last October as fitting with the BBC's public purpose.</p> <p>Some within the BBC privately believe Elliott's anger is due to the fact that he had been in on-off talks for several years about making Time Out's listings available to the corporation. Elliott admits that he always felt the BBC would be a \"perfect partner\" for the magazine he famously started on a kitchen table in his mother's house in Gloucester Road with \u00a370 from his aunt, but \"BBC Worldwide were not really prepared to entertain, let's call it a joint venture, of any description\".</p> <p>\"Really what they wanted, in the two or three times we talked about it seriously, was to own the business and I was not interested in selling the business. We just never got anywhere and then they went off and bought Lonely Planet, which pissed us off to say the least.\"</p> <p>After 40 years in the publishing business, during which Time Out has expanded from a London-based listings magazine to a global empire with 23 magazines in 16 countries and more than 40 regularly updated city guides, parallels with current events come easily to mind for Elliott: \"Elements of this feel very similar to the TV listings thing, there are clearly aspects of this that do not feel right. Somebody, ie the government, needs to take a view on this.\"</p> <p>That \"TV listings thing\" was a near decade-long battle against the duopoly over programme information held by the Radio Times and TV Times, which was eventually ended by the then Tory government in 1991. Time Out set the ball rolling when it published full TV listings to coincide with the launch of Channel 4 in 1982. The magazine ended up being taken to court.</p> <p>That fight came just a year after Elliott faced his own internal dispute as staff mutinied over pay, leading to a vicious strike that halted publication and eventually saw about four-fifths of his staffers, including the Guardian's cartoonist Steve Bell, quit to set up a rival publication, City Limits, with backing from Ken Livingstone and the GLC. The strike still rankles with Elliott: \"It was a tribal split and the reality is that a big group within that group should have left the company two or three years earlier, and fucked off and done their own magazine instead of staying in place and constantly warring about editorial control and direction. It was a bit of a misery.\" </p> <p>This battling Elliott is a far cry from the man described by his ex-wife Janet Street-Porter, who was with him in the mid-1970s. In her book Fall Out she portrays him as rather self-effacing and shy. \"I was a lot shyer then,\" he remembers. \"I have got much better. As you get older you get more confident.\"</p> <p>\"Fights are easy because they are black and white, but having casual conversations with complete strangers about nothing in particular is extremely hard work and I am not very good at that at all. I think that comes from what kind of background you come from.\"</p> <p>Elliott grew up in what he describes as \"one of those very silent non-speaking families\". His relationship with a father who walked out when he was 18 was \"terrible\" and it was the move from being a boarder at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire to Westminster college, where he fell in with a group of older students who were regularly visiting art galleries and clubs, that helped draw him out of himself.</p> <p>\"I went immediately from Stowe which was a very rigid, conventional, traditional in a way, public school, into an environment that was like being at university, and hooked up with a bunch of people from London who were sophisticated and it completely changed my life.\"</p> <p>He went to Keele University to study French and history, and worked on the student magazine Unit. On becoming editor in 1967 he decided to break it out of its parochial roots, print more copies and start selling in London's underground hangouts. The magazine included interviews with Jimi Hendrix, Yoko Ono and film director Joseph Losey as well as artist Keith Albarn, father of Blur frontman Damon Albarn.</p> <p>Rather than complete his degree, Elliott returned to London in 1968 with plans to produce a magazine. Before the first issue hit newsstands on August 12 1968, he had toyed with the idea of making it free. Forty years on that idea is back. As the internet draws more traffic, Time Out is looking at slimming down as a magazine and putting its listings info on the web. With nearly 2 million unique users per month for its UK site and twice that across all its properties, it already has a sizeable readership.</p> <p>\"We are in quite an intensive period of thinking and researching to re-plan for the future. The issue is, if you have got a situation in two to three years where the comprehensive role that we play is online, the question is what shape does the print magazine take? Do we have a smaller magazine that is cheaper? Also we have to look at the free route. I am not sure, but there are people in the building who say 'maybe we should look at free'. There is an audience out there, younger people, who because of online do not expect to pay for things. The downside is that advertisers in general do not like free.\"</p> <p>Transformation in any form is going to cost money - and in the current advertising downturn Time Out is already cutting costs. So Elliott is looking for some funding, not least because he would like to buy out the investors in Time Out New York who have been there since 1995. The trouble is, everyone who has approached him over the past few years - such as private equity players - have wanted control, with a firm timetable to a full exit, probably through a flotation. Elliott has radically different ideas.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely true that every aspect of the business would benefit from having more working capital and it would make sense to widen the ownership of the business,\" he admits. \"But in a perfect world I would like this business to remain independent long, long, long term.\"</p> <p>Achieving that ambition may prove to be his hardest battle yet.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 61<br><strong>Education</strong> Stowe School, Buckinghamshire; Westminster college, London; Keele University (French and history)<br><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1968 </strong>Started Time Out from his mother's kitchen in Gloucester Road, London.

  "<p>'Some nations have a gift for ceremonial,\" wrote the future third Marquess of Salisbury, Lord Robert Cecil, after watching Queen Victoria open parliament. \"No poverty of means or absence of splendour inhibits them from making any pageant in which they take part both real and impressive. Everybody falls naturally into his proper place, throws himself without effort into the spirit of the little drama he is enacting and instinctively represses all appearance of constraint or distracted attention.\"</p> <p>What was arguably true for 19th century Britain (Cecil, as it happens, believed that Britain did not possess that gift) is no less so for 21st century America. As one party convention ends and another begins (hurricane permitting), we are halfway through a fortnight of ticker tape, talking points, balloons and bluster. </p> <p>There was a time when these conventions meant something more than mere pageantry. They were the place where arguments were made, platforms thrashed out and delegates wooed with policy. But like British party conferences, conventions are now essentially media events at which the media enjoys neither particular access, information nor, for the most part, insight. The result is two weeks of propaganda rolled out like a well-choreographed marketing campaign and faithfully transmitted by supine outlets.</p> <p>Like most acts of ceremony, form has long surpassed content. The further they have strayed from the substance the more the symbols matter. Strip away the high-minded commentary and you are left with two patriotic parades steeped in electoral rivalry and masquerading as a celebration of democratic culture. </p> <p>As far as pageantry goes, they could certainly be worse. At least in these there are no gilded coaches, crowns, ermine or wigs. And yet despite the slew of historic candidacies - first Barack Obama and now Sarah Palin - it seems as though this year America's political class has less to celebrate than ever. </p> <p>For the conventions do not just mark the beginning of a new presidential cycle but the passing of an old one. The fact that this administration has been criminally incompetent is now the stuff of water-cooler orthodoxy. The fact that it has been plain criminal is not. But it should be. Under George Bush the US has tortured, disenfranchised, lied, spied and, on more than one occasion, flouted its own constitution. Those who would not go along were fired or demoted. Those rulings it could not garner support for it simply classified or hid. Those inquiries it could not prevent it thwarted. When Major General Antonio Taguba tried to pursue his investigation of Abu Ghraib up the chain of command he was stopped. \"I was legally prevented from further investigation into higher authority,\" he told the New Yorker. </p> <p>Its violation of international law is ultimately a matter for the international community. But its violation of American laws is a matter for the American public. However, it is now clear that the political consequences of these transgressions will range from negligible to non-existent. The Bush administration should be led away in handcuffs - either indicted or impeached. Instead it is about to leave the scene of the crime in broad daylight while those tasked to police this democracy - notably politicians and the press - blind themselves with confetti. </p> <p>Those who regard impeachment as merely a vindictive attempt to adjudicate the past display a chronic lack of imagination. True, it is not going to happen. But that makes it no less morally compelling or politically relevant to argue that it should. Trying to look ahead without acknowledging how you got to where you are is a surefire way to end up wandering around in circles. And the last place the Democrats want to be is where they were.</p> <p>Take voter registration. Around this time last year the attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, was forced to resign amid allegations of perjury before Congress over his role in the politically motivated firing of seven attorneys. They were replaced by what his then chief of staff referred to as \"loyal Bushies\" on the advice of the White House. Five of the fired attorneys were in battleground states. They had irritated local Republicans by refusing to bring voter fraud cases targeted at loyal Democratic groups because of lack of evidence. </p> <p>The congressional hearings were a farce. Gonzales said he \"could not recall\" more than 71 times in one day. Clearly he hoped we would forget too. </p> <p>But in a year when voter rolls are swelling with the expectation of an unprecedented turnout it is crucial that we remember. A few weeks ago John McCain's campaign attorneys attended a national training session for Republican lawyers on election law, which included a session on identifying and responding to instances of voter fraud. Despite the justice department's own studies showing that voter fraud is extremely rare, Republicans are gearing up for mass intimidation in minority areas on election day. If the election is close expect to see Florida 2000 replayed from Virginia to Nevada. And if the challenges go to court, Gonzales's \"loyal Bushies\" will be there to hear the cases.</p> <p>Such are the lasting consequences of Bush's crooked tenure. Casting him as inept and unethical is not difficult. He is the most unpopular president for six decades. Some have been loathed more - but none by so many for so long. But understanding how he managed to do it demands a wider lens. </p> <p>For he could not do it alone. The US is not an elected dictatorship. The president is supposed to stand at the helm of a system of checks and balances. The reason there was no balance was because there were no checks. The real problem with the Bush years is not so much that he did what he did, but that he managed to gain the consent of America's political class in enabling him to do it. His political estrangement is not because he tried, only because he failed. </p> <p>This has more or less been conceded by none other than the leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who voted against the war in Iraq. When asked recently by the Nation why she took impeachment off the table before the 2006 elections, Pelosi answered: \"What about these other people who voted for that war with no evidence ... Are they going to be voting with us to impeach the president? Where are these Democrats going to be? Are they going to be voting for us to impeach a president who took us to war on information that they had also?\" In other words, for the Democrats to impeach the president they would first have to implicate themselves.</p> <p>This is not to say the Democrats were equally culpable. But they were differently responsible, and cowed by accusations of lack of patriotism most of them abdicated that responsibility.</p> <p>Asked to explain the administration's use of torture, the director of the 9/11 commission, Philip Zelikow, said: \"Fear and anxiety exploited by zealots and fools.\" But there is, it seems, no price to pay for being a zealot or a fool in power. America will no doubt be anxious and fearful again some day. And for all the ceremonial hyperbole of this convention season, there is little to suggest that when that day comes the fools and zealots won't once again come out on top.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>After three weeks in Georgia reporting on the war and its aftermath, I find one conversation sticks with me. I had arrived in Karaleti, a Georgian village north of Gori. I had gone there with a group of foreign journalists in a Russian army truck; our ultimate destination was Tskhinvali, in South Ossetia. Several houses along the main road had been burned down; an abandoned Lada lay in a ditch; someone had looted the local school.</p> <p>Refugees from Karaleti and nearby villages gave the same account: South Ossetian militias had swept in on August 12, killing, burning, stealing and kidnapping. Sasha, our Kremlin minder, however, had a different explanation. \"Georgian special commandos burned the houses,\" he told us. I demurred, pointing out that it was unlikely Georgian special commandos would have burned down Georgian villages north of Tskhinvali, deep inside rebel-held South Ossetia. Sasha's face grew dark; he wasn't used to contradiction. \"Those houses suffered from a gas or electricity leak,\" he answered majestically. </p> <p>Despite Sasha's inventive attempts to lie, it's evident what is currently happening in Georgia: South Ossetian militias, facilitated by the Russian army, are carrying out the worst ethnic cleansing since the war in former Yugoslavia. Despite the random nature of these attacks, the overall aim is clear: to create a mono-ethnic greater South Ossetia in which Georgians no longer exist. </p> <p>Before Georgia's attack on Tskhinvali on August 7/8, South Ossetia was a small but heterogeneous region, a patchwork of picturesque Georgian and Ossetian villages. Georgia's government controlled a third; the separatists and their handlers from Russia's spy agencies controlled another third, principally around the town of Tskhinvali; the other third was under nobody's control. Surprisingly, both groups coexisted in South Ossetia. </p> <p>A week after the conflict started I drove up to Akhalgori, a mountain town, 41km north-west of Tbilisi. South Ossetian militias, together with Russian soldiers from Dagestan, had captured the town the previous evening. Most residents had already fled; by the bus stop I found a group of women waiting for a lift. The town had no history of ethnic conflict, they said. Its population was mixed. Now almost all the Georgians had fled. I asked a militia leader, Captain Elrus, whether his men had ethnically cleansed Georgian villages between Tskhinvali and Gori. \"We did carry out cleaning operations, yes,\" he admitted. </p> <p>The Kremlin's South Ossetian allies have re-established the old Soviet borders of South Ossetia. This new, greater territory will, as South Ossetia's parliamentary speaker made clear on Friday, become part of the Russian Federation: a large Georgian-free enclave stretching almost to the suburbs of Tbilisi. </p> <p>Back in Karaleti, meanwhile, villagers are continuing to flee. After August 12, dozens escaped on foot, walking for three days across the fields, hiding from the militias and eating wild plums. South Ossetian gunmen are preventing refugees from returning, and forcing the few elderly residents who remain to leave as well. The Russian military has done nothing to stop this. Its peacekeeping mandate is little more than a pretext for occupation. There are Russian checkpoints between Gori and Tskhinvali. </p> <p>EU leaders meet today in Brussels to discuss how to respond to Russia's invasion and occupation of Georgia, and President Dmitry Medvedev's unilateral recognition of South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence. Already the European appetite for sanctions appears to be fading, with the French and the Germans signalling an unwillingness to punish Moscow. But the EU needs to be clear about what is happening. Russia is not merely redrawing the map of Europe but changing its human geography too. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:luke.harding@theguardian.com\">luke.harding@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is impossible to know whether the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Tarique Ghaffur, is justified in claiming himself a victim of racial, religious and age discrimination. There is no way of guessing whether his decision to hire private security guards to protect himself against death threats represents realism or a public relations gambit.</p> <p>What is for sure is that any business that has ever employed workers from minorities, or indeed women, has experience of the legal minefield this represents. In my days as an editor, I once decided to remove a woman from her important and sensitive job, only to discover that she was pregnant. I accepted our lawyers' recommendation, that we should pay almost double her legal entitlement in redundancy money, to avoid an otherwise inevitable claim of discrimination.</p> <p>Likewise, when I sacked a gay executive, he threatened to go to court, despite the fact that we were simultaneously threatened with litigation by several of his women subordinates, who claimed that he had persecuted them. Every modern company is familiar with these predicaments. Anybody who loses their job, or indeed fails to advance in accordance with their ambitions, is bitter. Unsurprisingly, they seek to exploit the law to gain maximum possible compensation.</p> <p>Members of minorities enjoy exceptional opportunities in terms of litigation. Yet this does not, of course, mean that their grievances are ill-founded. I remember a conversation with a group of soldiers a decade or so ago, about the first overtly gay soldier to join the Brigade of Guards. After a few minutes ribaldry, a Guardsman said cheerfully: \"It'll be the same as it was with the blacks, sir. They'll go on falling downstairs until they get the message.\"</p> <p>The army has moved a long way since that exchange, but it would be naive not to recognise that racism and sexism persist in the military - as they do in the police. By their nature, both recruit from a stratum of society in which casual prejudice remains widespread. </p> <p>Great institutional efforts have been made to eliminate this, but problems remain. The \"canteen culture\" is not dead. Few senior policemen are anything like as impressive as their counterparts in the armed forces, and their limitations trickle all the way down.</p> <p>Britain's police service operates in a climate of rancour. Many of its members feel themselves unloved, obliged to operate in a mire of bureaucracy, political correctness, and constantly shifting targets and constraints. When white officers feel aggrieved, as they often do, Asian, black and woman colleagues provide easy scapegoats.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to spend most of my own office life in places where women were respected and indeed highly valued. But one was always aware of other times and other places. My mother left university in 1933, in the depth of the depression, a bad time to look for work. A friend of her parents was a director of the biscuit manufacturers, Huntley &amp; Palmer. He agreed to see her, but said immediately at the interview: \"We do not employ women, Anne, except at factory level, and we have no present intention of doing so. Women aren't good at business, and it wouldn't be fair on the men.\" She asked: was there not the humblest opening in the office ? \"No, only in the factory and that leads nowhere. Your mother tells me you went to Oxford. Frankly, that's a disadvantage. There is no room in industry for educated women. The men don't like them.\"</p> <p>My mother ended up working in newspapers, not biscuits, but always felt herself fighting an assertively macho culture. Even today, many working women would state that, while law and cultural trends are on their side, there are still plenty of workplaces where they are abused and harassed. Patently frivolous cases which sometimes reach tribunals, and are widely reported in the media, do not disprove the reality of discrimination.</p> <p>One of my own fondest memories of editorship is that it taught me to work in close and often warm relationships with women, devoid of any hint of sexuality. It was a revelation to cast aside all the adolescent, and indeed post-adolescent, male baggage of perceiving every female as a prospective object of desire. But some men still find this hard to do, and the consequences are seen daily at employment tribunals.</p> <p>To understand alleged workplace discrimination, it seems essential first to acknowledge the arbitrariness of all hirings and firings, inseparable from the unfairness of life. Every day in every company and institution bosses make choices about appointments, promotions and dismissals. These are as flawed as all human decisions. However hard society strives to impose objective scrutiny and impartial criteria, in the end who gets on and who gets off is determined by personal judgment.</p> <p>White middle-class males have less scope to seek legal redress than do members of minorities. But they should not allow that to blind them to the fact that they are also less likely to suffer genuine injustice. Back in the early 1990s when John Birt as director general introduced a policy of positive discrimination at the BBC, I thought he was wrong.</p> <p>I later changed my mind. I became very conscious of the embarrassing whiteness of the newspaper offices over which I myself presided. It was not that we discriminated against black and Asian job candidates, it was that hardly any came forward. In a very modest fashion, I set about recruiting some black and Asian journalists, because it was plain that unless we took the initiative, nothing would happen.</p> <p>Today, many employers up and down Britain do the same. The police and army have made big efforts to increase recruitment from minorities. The Ghaffur case, however, deals a sharp blow to the process. Britain's highest-ranking policeman proclaims himself the victim of discrimination. Whether or not this is true, it can scarcely fail to damage the Met.</p> <p>For years, whether he liked it or not, Tarique Ghaffur has walked into every room knowing that he was perceived not merely as himself, but as Britain's top Asian cop. It is unsurprising that, bearing this burden, he feels a special bitterness about being denied further advancement. The most likely outcome, as in all such cases, is that he will now be paid a lot of money to go away. It is all a great pity, because in many respects race relations in Britain are progressing better than any of us might have expected a generation ago.</p> <p>The key workplace issue, with women as with black people and Asians, is that while some have risen high, virtually none have got to the very top. Until they do so the perception, if not the reality, of discrimination will persist. It may well be true that Tarique Ghaffur has progressed as far in the Metropolitan police as his merits entitle him to do. But until some Asians and black people and more women occupy the most senior roles in Britain's companies and institutions, people like Ghaffur will continue to believe that the path to the very top is blocked not only for them, but for others. Until evidence is there to gainsay this, Britain will not be perceived as a fair society.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"The big teams, even when they play badly, they take points,\" said Norwich City's Dejan Stefanovic after Birmingham City escaped with a scarcely deserved draw. Norwich were left cursing their inability to take advantage of their dominance, but it bodes ill for the rest of the Championship that Alex McLeish's Blues are not yet at full throttle.</p> <p>Birmingham have stumbled to 10 points from a possible 12. Six goals in four games is a mediocre return for a team with a supposed embarrassment of attacking riches but still they are undefeated and equal top on points. \"Every team we've played has made it tough,\" said James McFadden. \"In the end it's probably a good result.\"</p> <p>At half-time Birmingham must wondered how they were ahead. By full-time the mystery was how they had failed to take three points. Kevin Phillips had scored clinching goals in all three league games prior to this and was clean through as the seconds ticked down. \"I would have put my house on him scoring,\" said McLeish. David Marshall's excellent save from the former West Brom striker meant an end to Birmingham's 100% start, but that record had already begun to flatter. </p> <p>McLeish has much to ponder. Finding a compatible partner for Lee Carsley in midfield remains a priority, Sebastian Larsson still appears shell-shocked at the rough-and-tumble of this division, and Blues' attacking options are yet to gel.</p> <p>It took 35 minutes for Birmingham to carve out a chance, Phillips blasting over, but five minutes later they were ahead. McFadden drove in a free-kick and Larsson broke loose to head home. Darel Russell equalised just after the interval and even if Norwich, who are expected to take Bolton's Heidar Helguson on loan for the season, could not muster their first-half control they were comfortable until Gary McSheffrey volleyed over late on.</p> <p>\"We played against the top side and for 90 minutes we were the better side,\" said Stefanovic. \"We deserved to win the game.\" But, as Birmingham will testify, you do not always get what you deserve.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Ryan Bertrand (Norwich City)</p>",
  "<p>Leaky ships have been at the front of my mind lately, as I've been writing a chapter for a media law book about the protection of journalists' sources and reading Moby-Dick. The two turned out to have more in common than I thought. </p> <p>Great chunks of Moby-Dick are devoted to the business of classifying whales, and to the task of defining and explaining whaling terms. So the reader learns that a \"gam\" took place when two whaling ships pulled alongside one another for a chat; \"fluke\" is not just something that happens by chance, as it also means a whale's tail; the Heidelburgh Tun is inside the whale's head; and \"Town-ho\" is not an insult, but one of the calls made by a 19th-century sailor from the masthead when he spotted a whale. </p> <p>Melville is equally meticulous about revealing his sources. He lists dozens at the beginning of the book, and then regularly backs up his story with facts and figures and more sources. From this point of view he's a solid reporter. But writers of news stories are very often not in a position to say where they got their information. Confidential material is usually leaked on the basis that the identity of the person who provided it will stay secret. The moral obligation to protect confidential sources is a basic tenet of journalistic ethics, and the understanding between the writer and the source may not need to be spoken. </p> <p>When a law enforcement agency, government department or business discovers a leak, the court is the first port of call. Boats are lowered, harpoons got ready and an order is sought requiring the journalist to disclose information so that the source can be hunted down. Inevitably there's a struggle. Journalists enjoy qualified legal rights to protect their sources and have exercised them with varying degrees of success. </p> <p>Rights under article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which protects free speech, are always asserted and journalists rely on the Contempt of Court Act 1981, which prevents an order for disclosure being made unless it is \"necessary in the interest of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime\". But at this point in the discussion we hit a stumbling block. Who is a journalist in an era of mass self-publishing? </p> <p>The answer matters because case law tends to talk in terms of freedom of the press and journalistic privilege rather than everyone's privilege. \"Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom,\" said the European court of human rights in the Goodwin case 12 years ago. \"Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public in matters of public interest. As a result the vital watchdog role of the press may be undermined.\" While this holds true, the task of ensuring the free flow of information is no longer the sole preserve of journalists.</p> <p>In the US, Congress is considering a federal shield law to allow journalists to protect their confidential sources. Clay Shirky, in his book Here Comes Everybody, which describes how technologies have given rise to \"group-forming networks\" of people who don't need traditional organisations to operate, considers the problem of defining \"journalist\" so as to frame a law. \"If anyone can be a publisher, then anyone can be a journalist,\" he says. \"And if anyone can be a journalist, then journalistic privilege suddenly becomes a loophole too large to be borne by society.\"</p> <p>Shirky adds: \"Journalistic privilege has to be applied to a minority of people, in order to preserve the law's ability to uncover and prosecute wrongdoing while allowing a safety valve for investigative reporting.\" But he doesn't believe the solution is to exclude bloggers. \"The simple answer is that there is no simple answer,\" he says.</p> <p>It seems likely that lawyers will have to come up with new classifications and definitions in cases where writers resist disclosure orders. Whatever the outcome, it's unlikely that journalists will be heard to shout \"thar she blows\" if ordered to point to a source. Potential informants would have no reason to trust them if they did. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:reader@theguardian.com\">reader@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I suppose we should be used to it by now, but sometimes the hypocrisy of newspapers takes the breath away. Writing about Paul Gadd (alias Gary Glitter), recently released from a Vietnamese jail where he served nearly three years for sexual offences against girls of 10 and 11, the Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell demanded: \"Who gave this reptilian exhibitionist the oxygen of publicity? Who propelled him to world notoriety and made his claims for state protection legitimate?\"</p> <p>Well, let's a hazard few guesses. Could it be the Sun's Virginia Wheeler who got to sit next to Gadd on a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok and reported how she \"shuddered\" as he \"stroked my arm and called me 'sweetie'\"? Or some of the 20 or so other hacks on the flight? Or the Mirror which revealed how he \"shamelessly acted the prima donna by signing autographs\" on the flight? Could it even be the Mail itself which pictured Gadd on the front page, alongside the Olympic winner Christine Ohuruogu under the headline \"Best of British, Worst of British\"?</p> <p>None of these. According to Platell, the guilty party was the home secretary Jacqui Smith who announced, as Gadd left Vietnam, that she wanted to stop convicted paedophiles travelling abroad - which was exactly what a Sun leader demanded the same morning. This was \"sickening opportunism\" and \"high-profile paedo-bashing\" which \"helped whip up\" a \"frenzy\" that will mean taxpayers have to pay to protect him, said Platell. No doubt it was Smith who provoked the Sun into putting Gadd on its front page five times in the past two weeks; the Mail into tracking down a son he left in Cuba after an eight-year affair; the News of the World into interviewing - with their faces fully exposed in a two-column picture - the two Vietnamese girls he molested.</p> <p>As John Junor used to say, \"pass the sickbag, Alice\". Last week, the Sun, whose editor Rebekah Wade is said to be passionate about protecting children, devoted considerable resources to tracking Gadd's whereabouts on his return to the UK. It found him in Hampshire and pictured him disguised by \"an absurd ginger wig and straw hat\". The headline was \"You can run but you can't hide.\" Wade would argue her paper was performing a service by informing the local community of Gadd's presence - \"disturbingly, kids' toys litter the front lawn. . . next door\" - and stopping him molesting more children while living incognito. But the disguise is made necessary by the hatred created by media coverage, which threatens mob violence and even murder - and surely makes it more likely that Gadd will eventually move somewhere the Sun can't find him, adopt an effective disguise and thus get more opportunities to attack children, possibly overseas. </p> <p>That leaves two solutions: either Gadd - who has been found guilty only of downloading child pornography under British law - is locked up for life, or he is left to the mercy of what the Telegraph columnist Simon Heffer calls \"most rational people [who] would find it quite acceptable if he were to be taken out and shot in the back of the head\".</p> <p>But \"pervs\" will always be a subject of redtop fascination. This applies particularly to those, such as Gadd, who have fallen from the pinnacle of success. As Sam Warner, a psychologist, suggested in the Independent on Sunday, Gadd embodies elemental public fears about paedophiles who worm their way into our lives, behaving oddly but quite lovably, while secretly planning to damage our children. In his 1970s heyday, Gary Glitter was hugely popular with under-16s while being regarded by anybody older (and more sophisticated children) as a bit of a laugh, if a harmless one.</p> <p>The press colluded in creating that image. In 1973, for example, the Sun interviewed \"the rock 'n' roll Daddy who makes little girls ask to see more of his hairy chest\", a wish the paper happily granted with a picture. The Sun added, innocently (well, if it wasn't innocent, it's a scandal): \"Gary Glitter thinks a lot about kids.\" In the same year, the Mail's Roderick Gilchrist was sold a tale about a \"wild man of rock\" who, in \"real\" life, discussed Marx and Lenin, played Beethoven's violin concerto (\"it has humour and tenderness\", Glitter confided) and went fishing in the country. The headline, again presumably innocent, was \"When a pop star stops rocking, you'd be surprised at what he gets up to\". Glitter was even interviewed in 1977 by the Express's Jean Rook, then known as \"the first lady of Fleet Street\". She found him \"astonishingly modest and gentle\".</p> <p>Reading it all now sends shivers down the spine - but it was a standard example of the PR fluff fed to the press, then as now, about most celebrities. No wonder newspapers sound as if they have been almost personally violated.</p> <p>Moreover, \"pervs\" play an important role in defining the boundary between the respectable folk who read and produce redtop papers and what sociologists call \"the other\". The Sun may publish revealing pictures of women just above the age of consent, as well as of flat-chested models, sometimes dressed as young schoolgirls. Anybody who objects is roundly denounced as \"politically correct\". But to assure us they are not encouraging paedophilia, the redtops must denounce, even more vehemently, anybody who lays a finger on anyone aged 15 years 364 days or less. This explains why Glitter's name can never appear without being shepherded by such words as brute, evil, foul, depraved, monster, scum and, specially brought out by the Sun's Lorraine Kelly for the occasion,\"toxic effluent\".</p> <p>Because nobody wants to be accused of even a smidgen of sympathy for paedophiles, it is hard, from what we are told of his misdemeanours, to defend Gadd or argue that people like him deserve human rights. </p> <p>Since I never liked the look (still less the music) of Glitter anyway, I'm not even going to try. But popular hatred, once aroused, can be hard to control. The Sun implicitly invited readers to look out for Gadd, asking for pictures of him \"out and about\". The false sightings could exceed those of Madeleine McCann. Let us hope that one of Heffer's \"rational people\" doesn't get the wrong person.</p> <p><strong>Subs are the future</strong></p> <p>After 15 years, it seems the newspaper price war, in the quality market at least, is over. By raising the Times cover price to 80p, Rupert Murdoch has brought it back into line with its rivals. The surprising thing is it has taken him so long. The price cut gave the Times a dramatic boost, moving its circulation ahead of the Guardian and Independent, but never, as Murdoch hoped, threatening the Telegraph. That paper kept sales buoyant with a heavily-discounted subscription scheme, binding readers of the daily paper into taking the weaker Sunday as well. </p> <p>Now Murdoch has followed with his own seven-day, voucher-based subscription scheme, more flexible than the Telegraph's, which doesn't give you a voucher you can use at different newsagents. Readers pay \u00a35.50 a week for the two papers, instead of \u00a36.90. He has also copied the Independent's offer of free home deliveries. The clear message is that, for qualities, subscriptions is where the future action lies.</p>",
  "<p>Political inaction on global warming has become so dire that nations must now consider extreme technical solutions - such as blocking out the sun - to address catastrophic temperature rises, scientists from around the world warn today.</p> <p>The experts say a reluctance \"at virtually all levels\" to address soaring greenhouse gas emissions means carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are on track to pass 650 parts-per-million (ppm), which could bring an average global temperature rise of 4C. They call for more research on geo-engineering options to cool the Earth, such as dumping massive quantities of iron into oceans to boost plankton growth, and seeding artificial clouds over oceans to reflect sunlight back into space.</p> <p>Writing the introduction to a special collection of scientific papers on the subject, published today by the Royal Society, Brian Launder of the University of Manchester and Michael Thompson of the University of Cambridge say: \"While such geoscale interventions may be risky, the time may well come when they are accepted as less risky than doing nothing.\"</p> <p>They add: \"There is increasingly the sense that governments are failing to come to grips with the urgency of setting in place measures that will assuredly lead to our planet reaching a safe equilibrium.\"</p> <p>Professor Launder, a mechanical engineer, told the Guardian: \"The carbon numbers just don't add up and we need to be looking at other options, namely geo-engineering, to give us time to let the world come to its senses.\" He said it was important to research and develop the technologies so that they could be deployed if necessary. \"At the moment it's almost like talking about how we could stop world war two with an atomic bomb, but we haven't done the research to develop nuclear fission.\"</p> <p>Such geo-engineering options have been talked about for years as a possible last-ditch attempt to control global temperatures, if efforts to constrain emissions fail. Critics argue they are a dangerous distraction from attempts to limit carbon pollution, and that they could have disastrous side-effects. They would also do nothing to prevent ecological damage caused by the growing acidification of the oceans, caused when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change dismissed geo-engineering as \"largely speculative and unproven and with the risk of unknown side-effects\".</p> <p>Dr Alice Bows of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester said: \"I'm not a huge fan of messing with the atmosphere in an geo-engineering sense because there could be unpredictable consequences. But there are also a lot of unpredictable consequences of temperature increase. It does appear that we're failing to act [on emissions]. And if we are failing to act, then we have to consider some of the other options.\"</p> <p>In a strongly worded paper with colleague Kevin Anderson in today's special edition of the society's Philosophical Transactions journal, Bows says politicians have significantly underestimated the scale of the climate challenge. They say this year's G8 pledge to cut global emissions 50% by 2050, in an effort to limit global warming to 2C, has no scientific basis and could lead to \"dangerously misguided\" policies.</p> <p>The scientists say global carbon emissions are rising so fast that they would need to peak by 2015 and then decrease by up to 6.5% each year for atmospheric CO2 levels to stabilise at 450ppm, which might limit temperature rise to 2C. Even a goal of 650ppm - way above most government projections - would need world emissions to peak in 2020 and then reduce 3% each year.</p> <p>Globally, a 4C temperature rise would have a catastrophic impact. According to the government's Stern review on the economics of climate change in 2006, between 7 million and 300 million more people would be affected by coastal flooding each year, there would be a 30-50% reduction in water availability in southern Africa and the Mediterranean, agricultural yields would decline 15-35% in Africa and 20-50% of animal and plant species would face extinction.</p> <p>Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society, said: \"It's not clear which of these geo-engineering technologies might work, still less what environmental and social impacts they might have, or whether it could ever be prudent or politically acceptable to adopt any of them. But it is worth devoting effort to clarifying both the feasibility and any potential downsides of the various options. None of these technologies will provide a 'get out of jail free card' and they must not divert attention away from efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\"</p> <p>Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth said: \"We can't afford to wait for magical geo-engineering solutions to get us out of the hole we have dug ourselves into. The solutions that exist now, such as a large-scale energy efficiency programme and investment in wind, wave and solar power, can do the job if we deploy them at the scale and urgency that is needed.\"</p>",
  "<p>An opposition internet news site owner in Russia's troubled Ingushetia region was fatally shot yesterday after being detained by police. Magomed Yevloyev was one of the most high-profile journalists to be killed in Russia since the investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead near her Moscow apartment in 2006, provoking condemnation of Russia's record on media freedom.</p> <p>Yevloyev, who owned the website <a href=\"http://www.Ingushetiya.ru\">Ingushetiya.ru</a>, was a vocal critic of the region's Kremlin-backed administration, accused by opponents of crushing dissent and free speech.</p> <p>A lawyer for the repeated official attempts to close it down, said police met Yevloyev at the steps of an aircraft after he flew into Ingushetia's airport and drove him away in a Volga car. \"As they drove he was shot in the temple ... They threw him out of the car near the hospital,\" Kaloi Akhilgov told Reuters by telephone. \"He was discovered there and they quickly put him on the operating table, which is where he died.\"</p> <p>Akhilgov said Yevloyev, who was in his 30s, had flown from Moscow to Nazran on the same flight as the Kremlin-backed local leader, Murat Zyazikov, who has been struggling to contain a low-level insurgency by Islamist militants. A spokesman for Zyazikov could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>Interfax news agency cited an unnamed law enforcement source as saying that Yevloyev was shot by accident, and said prosecutors had opened a criminal case for causing the death by carelessness.</p> <p>In Moscow, Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the investigations unit of the prosecutor general's office, said only: \"A preliminary investigation is being carried out into the incident.\"</p>",
  "<p>It took a performance of admirable valour by Hull to produce a response worthy of rugby league's grandest stage - and it came from a St Helens team who will now be recognised as one of the finest to grace the Wembley turf.</p> <p>In the 111-year history of rugby's oldest knockout competition only Wigan had previously won three consecutive cup finals, and although they extended that run to eight between 1988 and 1995, that was largely down to a unique set of circumstances in which they had become the first club to employ their players as full-time professionals.</p> <p>\"That's not going to happen again,\" said Leon Pryce, the stand-off who was the key figure in dragging Saints out of their stickiest spot of any of their three final victories. \"It's nothing like Wigan's days any more, nowadays it's such a tight competition - the salary cap has made sure of that. So to win three Challenge Cup finals is a great achievement for us and a great thing to be part of. It may never happen again. That's why this was definitely my favourite.\"</p> <p>It also carried the reward for the Saints players of a short break in Madrid between their last league game of the season, against Wigan on Friday, and the first match of the play-offs against Leeds a fortnight later - payback after they held a January training camp in Cardiff when most rivals were preparing abroad. </p> <p>\"We're a lot better placed this year,\" added Pryce, whose post-Wembley warning last year that Leeds should be favourites to win the grand final at Old Trafford in October proved spot-on. \"Last year was so tough for us mentally and physically that we were shattered by the grand final. This year we're going to Spain for three days to relax and there's a different determination about winning the big games.\"</p> <p>That sets the stage for a couple of titanic showdowns against the World Club Challenge winners, Leeds. The two sides who stand apart from the rest of the Super League have one trophy each so far this year, setting things up beautifully for an autumn Old Trafford decider.</p> <p>Pryce conceded that Saturday's win carried extra satisfaction because Saints had been forced to dig so deep to earn it. That was partly down to the broiling heat which turned the second final at the new Wembley into a battle of attrition. \"It will be remembered as a struggle rather than a day for football purists,\" said Hull's coach Richard Agar. But the second half was compelling thanks to Hull's response to a 10-0 deficit.</p> <p>Kirk Yeaman was their headline figure in scoring two tries - the first an 80-metre interception, the second a powerful centre's finish - but Hull's courage was personified by Richard Horne. The 26-year-old half-back volunteered to make his first appearance since a career-threatening neck injury in April and threw himself into the battle after surviving a juddering James Graham tackle on his second touch that would have made lesser characters retreat quietly to the background.</p> <p>When Danny Tickle followed Yeaman's second try with another cool conversion, Hull held an improbable 12-10 lead with only 17 minutes left - the first time Saints have trailed in the second half of any of their final wins. \"I had a real bad feeling,\" admitted their coach, Daniel Anderson. \"We're a good front-running team, but we had squandered so many opportunities in the first half and it looked like that was going to bite us on the backside.\" </p> <p>However, as Anderson has said so often during four outstandingly successful seasons, \"our big players came up with big plays\". The powerful Samoan wing Francis Meli had been the lead man in the first half, plucking a pass from his ankles in the build-up to Matt Gidley's opening try and surging 80 metres for the second after a quick-thinking restart. But when the pressure was really on it was Pryce who did the business, striding through Hull's exhausted right-wing defence to lay on a simple second for Meli.</p> <p>Jon Wilkin, Saints' Hull-born second-row, then charged down a Danny Washbrook kick to extend the lead to 22-12, and although Hull hit back again, Pryce had the last word with one of the long-striding diagonal bursts that have become his trademark.</p> <p>His celebrations were extravagant, as the tension of the contest was finally released. \"When I was nine or 10 years old, that was my dream, to score a try that means you've won the Challenge Cup,\" he said. \"I'll savour that moment for a long time.\" After watching Wigan's dominance as a boy, Pryce knows that this St Helens team will long be remembered, too.</p> <p><strong>St Helens</strong> Wellens; Gardner, Gidley, Talau, Meli; Pryce, Long; Hargreaves, Cunningham (capt), Graham, Flannery, Wilkin, Sculthorpe. <strong>Interchange</strong> Gilmour, Roby, Clough, Fa'asavalu.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Gidley, Meli 2, Wilkin, Pryce. <strong>Goals</strong> Long 4.</p> <p><strong>Hull</strong> Byrne; Sing, G Horne, Yeaman, Raynor; Washbrook, Lee; Dowes, Berrigan, Cusack, Manu, Tickle, Radford. </p> <p><strong>Interchange</strong>: R Horne, Carvell, Briscoe, Thackray.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Yeaman 2, Raynor.

  "<p>Supermarkets have dramatically increased cut-price promotions of cheap sugary and fatty food as the credit crunch bites, a consumer watchdog says today.</p> <p>Incentives including \"buy one get one free\" offers could directly influence people's eating habits, according to a report by the government-funded National Consumer Council (NCC).</p> <p>It says money-saving opportunities are particularly important for lower-income families who are likely to be feeling the pinch more than most, and these deals are making it more attractive for consumers to choose more foods that contribute to an unhealthy diet.</p> <p>The NCC conducted a spot-check on branches of the top eight English chains in Sheffield before Easter, with Easter-related promotions not counted.</p> <p>It found more than 4,300 promotions - a sixth more than in the last snapshot survey in 2006. Previous checks conducted by the NCC have been at branches around England.</p> <p>More than half the promotions - 54% - related to foods high in fat and sugar, despite Food Standards Agency (FSA) advice that these foods should make up just 7% of diets. Only one in eight promotions featured fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>Lucy Yates, author of the report, entitled \"Cut-price, What Cost?\", said the volume of promotions for fatty and sugary foods was \"staggering\". She added: \"We expected to see evidence of big improvements since our last investigation, but we've been sadly disappointed. With so many of us buying our foods at these supermarkets, their collective behaviour can heavily influence the nation's eating habits. Despite their claims, the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose and enjoy a healthy diet.\"</p> <p>The NCC ranks supermarkets according to four health indicators, which cover nutritional content of own-labelled processed food, labelling information and customer advice, as well as promotions. Overall, Sainsbury's came top for the second time in a row, with the Co-op second, Waitrose third, Marks &amp; Spencer fourth, Asda and Tesco joint fifth, Somerfield seventh and Morrisons last for the fourth time in a row.</p> <p>The report says at least a third of price promotions should be for fruit and vegetables, with fewer involving fatty and sugary foods. Stores should move faster to reduce salt, sugar and fat levels in their brands. It commends the Co-op, Tesco and Waitrose for not having sweets at the checkouts.</p> <p>Sainsbury's, the Co-op and M&amp;S had taken on previous recommendations, the report said. \"These retailers have shown a real commitment to more responsible retailing and making their customers' health a priority, although more work needs to be done across the sector to curb unhealthy food promotion.\"</p> <p>However, the British Retail Consortium rubbished the report, saying the \"one-off snap shot ... in one English city last March\" used \"misleading comparisons to unfairly criticise retailers' records on encouraging healthier food choices\".</p> <p>It said promotions were balanced across the year. \"Customers will have seen for themselves the current high-profile price war centred on fruit and vegetables.\"</p> <p>Tesco questioned the NCC's method of judging nutrition labelling, saying its bias towards one colour-coded system recommended by the FSA clouded the facts. </p> <p>Morrisons also rejected the findings, saying: \"It's six months out of date, contains a number of inaccuracies and is a largely subjective assessment.\"</p> <p>But a spokeswoman for the NCC discounted the seasonal argument. \"We include frozen and tinned fruit and vegetables. Supermarkets could discount what is there and we did not find they were doing so. A spot-check like this is totally fair. We set out to replicate what it is like for a normal shopper.\"</p>",
  "<p>Detectives investigating a fire at the home of millionaire businessman Christopher Foster launched a murder investigation last night after it emerged that his wife Jill, whose body was found in the wreckage of the mansion, died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p> <p>Police said a second body, which was found nearby, along with a rifle owned by Foster, is that of a man who has yet to be identified.</p> <p>Superintendent Gary Higgins, of West Mercia constabulary, said: \"The two bodies were found close to one another and the body of another dog found nearby. The dog has also been subject of a post-mortem examination, which revealed it too had been shot.\"</p> <p>Foster, 50, his wife, 49, and 15-year-old daughter, Kirstie, have been missing since fire swept through Osbaston House in Maesbrook on the Welsh borders early on Tuesday. </p> <p>The family had been at a friend's barbecue and had returned to the three-storey mansion on Monday evening. It is understood that Kirstie, who is still missing, was using an internet chatroom until 1am on Tuesday morning when the power was cut. </p> <p>Detectives say the fire started a few hours later, engulfing the house and outbuildings on the \u00a31.2m estate. When emergency services arrived they found a horsebox had been parked in front of the electronic gates, with its tyres punctured.</p> <p>Yesterday there was speculation that Foster, an oil tycoon who owed hundreds of thousands of pounds, may have killed his wife and daughter before setting fire to the house and turning the gun on himself. Another theory was that the family had been killed by one of Foster's business associates who was owed money.</p> <p>But Terence Baines, a former director of Foster's company, Ulva Ltd, said he thought that was unlikely. \"It's anyone's guess, but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and I can't see them behind something like this,\" said Baines. \"[Maybe] he just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him.\" </p> <p>Last night detectives said they were following up several lines of inquiry. An all-port alert remains in place. \"Although it is now being treated as a murder, we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident,\" said Detective Superintendent Jon Groves of West Mercia constabulary's major investigation unit. \"Police continue to work around the clock to establish the facts on what happened at Osbaston House that morning.\"</p> <p>Foster made his money developing insulation technology for oil rigs. But the businessman was branded \"bereft of the basic instincts of commercial morality\" by a high court judge this year. </p> <p>Court documents show Foster's company, Ulva Ltd, which had gone into liquidation, faced legal action from one of its suppliers for thousands of pounds, and also owed about \u00a3800,000 in tax.</p> <p>Forensic teams entered the house on Friday but the fingertip search had to be halted on Saturday night amid fears that a section of the building could collapse. </p> <p>According to local people, Foster was a well-known and apparently popular figure, with his wife acting as company secretary for the family business. Neighbours said he drove two Porsches and an Aston Martin and had moved to Maesbrook from Telford about four years ago.</p> <p>Yesterday people gathered to say prayers for the family at nearby St John's church. Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Prebendary David Austerberry said residents had been \"bewildered and stunned\" by the tragedy. \"It is hard to grasp exactly what has happened and it is clearly going to be some time before everything is revealed but today we pray for the Fosters and their family and friends who must be devastated by the events of early last Tuesday morning.\" </p> <p>He asked for the family of the Fosters \"not to be overwhelmed by the uncertainties of last week\" adding that those living in \"idyllic\" Maesbrook wanted to show their support for them and those involved in investigating the fire.</p> <p>Speaking after the service, retired farmer Sandy Simpson, 82, said: \"We are shocked, absolutely shocked. It's not the sort of thing that occurs in a country district like this.\" </p> <p>Bryan Edwards, of Melverley, said: \"Everybody is stunned. We want to support the people involved. It's very sad.\"</p>",
  "<p>Again is as short as 8-1 for next year's 1,000 Guineas after winning yesterday's Moyglare Stud Stakes in the style of a horse who will be better in time. The two-year-old filly was making her fourth racecourse appearance but still looked gangly and green, taking time to find her stride before running on strongly enough to hold off the previously unbeaten Shimah.</p> <p>Trainer David Wachman was winning his second Group One in eight days, after Bushranger's success in the Prix Morny at Deauville. Again's victory was also yet another source of satisfaction for the Coolmore organisation - one partner, Michael Tabor, owns the horse while another, John Magnier, is father-in-law to the trainer.</p> <p>\"I was very concerned this may have come a bit too quickly for her, but she did it really nicely,\" said Wachman. \"She's really a horse for next year because she's still big and weak.\" </p> <p>Trainer Jim Bolger may also have a challenger for next year's Guineas after his filly Maoineach was a surprise winner of a Group Three race on her debut earlier on the card. Her immediate target was given as the Prix Marcel Boussac on Arc day.</p> <p>Bolger won that race two years ago with subsequent dual Guineas heroine Finsceal Beo, but that filly's career may now be at an end after she finished unplaced in a Listed race yesterday.</p> <p>By contrast, Look Busy goes from strength to strength. Alan Berry's three-year-old ran away with the Group Three Flying Five Stakes, her sixth success from nine starts this year.</p>",
  "<p>With decent wings anybody can fly - pigs possibly, Wolves certainly. Under Stan Cullis in the 50s, with Johnny Hancocks and Jimmy Mullen, Wolves were the highest flyers of all. With Michael Kightly and Matt Jarvis they could reach those heights again. For the time being the top of the Championship will do.</p> <p>Mick McCarthy was almost excited. \"I had this thought last season when I signed Jarvo [from Gillingham]. That was how I wanted to play but one, then the other was injured and we never got both on the pitch at the same time. It's as good a performance for 45 minutes as I've seen from a team of mine for a long time.\" That in itself is not saying much. By any yardstick, though, the first half was scintillating. Forest were relieved not to be hit harder.</p> <p>Kightly, picked up from Grays Athletic, quickly attained England Under-21 recognition. His two goals here showed his versatility - a right-foot blast from 25 yards from a lay-back, then a left-foot chip inside the far post. Jarvis is more famous for now for being the son of British No1 table tennis players. Both players are 22, comfortable on either flank and ready to take on full-backs on the outside. Wolves have lengthened their pitch by five metres.</p> <p>Having got Luke Chambers expecting the knock and sprint, Jarvis started coming inside. The full-back's substitution was his only blessing. He may still be untangling mind and body. Jarvis left him for dead before crossing for the<br>fourth goal, tapped in by Chris Iwelumo.</p> <p>Iwelumo is the tall half of an imposing central strike force with Sylvan Ebanks-Blake. Both are 13stone plus but, whereas Iwelumo's 13 are spread through a shambling but coordinated 6ft 4in frame, his partner, 6in shorter, packs his in formidable thighs and rear that lend themselves to shielding the ball but do not seem to prevent mobility. They combined to set up the first goal for David Jones from another lay-off. Ebanks-Blake joins Kightly in Stuart Pearce's England Under-21 squad to play Portugal on Friday.</p> <p>Wolves had lost key defenders Jody Craddock and George Elokobi to long-term injuries on the previous weekends but such was their attacking verve and speed that it hardly showed. Nonetheless McCarthy hopes to bring in Matt Hill from Preston and perhaps Danny Higginbotham from Sunderland before midnight. </p> <p>For Saturday at left-back he had promised \"a secret weapon up his sleeve\". The forward Stephen Ward made a shaky opening, but thereafter Wolves were in control. Their other goal came from Paul Smith punching a free-kick on to the back of Wes Morgan's head for an own-goal. Later Wayne Hennessey did the same freakish thing, off Richard Stearman's head. It was the only thing Forest matched.</p> <p>Sunderland needed extra-time to beat Forest in the Carling Cup, drawing praise from Roy Keane. Perhaps it went to their heads. The Forest manager, Colin Calderwood, could only say here: \"We lost our imagination. We just couldn't compete.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Matt Jarvis (Wolves)</p>",
  "<p>The Family, launched amid much fanfare last week by Channel 4, is an everyday programme about everyday folk. Starring dad Simon, mum Jane and their three teenage children, the eight-parter has been heralded as a return to the early days of reality TV when the BBC2 series whose name it borrows was credited with inventing fly-on-the-wall techniques.</p> <p>Director Jonathan Smith filmed the Hugheses over 100 days and 5,000 hours. His edits are leisurely and his narratives simple, from squabbling teens to Simon's recent redundancy. It appears to be everything good public service programming should be.</p> <p>So does The Family represent a return to public service values after a decade or extraordinary exploits, or the final genre-crushing victory by the panzer tank of reality TV? The series was assembled using technology created for the Big Brother house, with bedroom cameras capturing moving conversations between husband and wife as they discuss emotional catastrophes. The attempt by its creators to absent themselves from the show suggests it is more the child of John De Mol, Big Brother's creator, than many would care to admit.</p> <p>Smith set out to make the distinction between reality TV and the documentary form clear. \"I think there is a pressure on documentaries to tick every possible box - popular, public service, true, real, entertaining,\" he says. And, with The Family occupying C4's prime 9pm slot on Wednesday evenings, the pressure on the Bafta-winning director will be intense.</p> <p>Smith adds: \"That's especially true after the recent rows about faking. I had hoped that some clarity would emerge about documentary versus reality after the scandal over The Queen, but it doesn't seem to have cleared anything up.\"</p> <p>As a result, he was keen for the series to feel as if it was set in a real home, \"not the jungle or an artificial house\". He was careful to avoid interviewing the family on screen, worried it would feel like a diary room. </p> <p>Indeed, the show has no mediated interaction between documentary maker and subject at all. \"We met the family for a beer and a takeaway once a week and we'd chat off camera,\" Smith explains.</p> <p>\"At the beginning I did interview them, but we found over time that what they were saying in the interviews they were also saying in conversations. I hoped you would get lots of detail and not need a voice-over telling you what you've just seen and what you're about to see all the time. With an argument between a brother and a sister, you can follow it as it builds up over a few days and everyone's experienced something like it so they don't need to be told. Simon and Jane talking in bed wouldn't have worked with the old fly on the wall crews, because you'd have to knock on the door, say 'are you in bed now?' and then lug the camera in.\"</p> <p>It was left to Simon Dickson, deputy head of documentaries at a channel aiming for public funding, to say: \"It's not a piece of reality TV. It's real TV. It's lovingly crafted.\" </p> <p>C4's adland clients welcome this approach. \"Reality television is a bit of a busted flush at the moment,\" argues Tom Morton, executive planning director at TBWA, the ad agency for Playstation, Mueller and Mars. \"It's like the National Lottery, it's a phenomenon, then an institution, then familiarity breeds contempt. The two main types of show are heading in different directions: bear pit shows, where you create a situation and wait for people to explode, like Big Brother and Celeb Air, seem to be searching for new lows. Life lesson programmes, like Dragons' Den and The Apprentice, on the other hand, are pulling in viewers and leave you feeling better. At the moment, it's quality that's attracting the big audiences. </p> <p>\"Hopefully The Family can bring that life lesson audience that the BBC has mastered over to commercial television. The problem is that we've had a decade of human-interest stories, from reality to Bella and Chat and GMTV, so it's unlikely to have the same power as the 70s original. If it really works, however, the audience will identify their own hopes, problems and aspirations in the family.\"</p> <p>Richard Klein, head of independent comissioning at BBC Knowledge, says: \"I think we do have a slight return to observational documentaries but with one crucial element added - we set up an intelligent trigger in the form of a question, pull the trigger and then observe what happens - which does come from reality formats. For instance, in The Choir - can music help children gain self-esteem? The audience are a little tired of overly gameshow style factual - but this is a more intelligent version.\"</p> <p>Michelle Davies, assistant editor at Grazia who worked at Heat in the years when it actively championed reality TV, goes further. \"I think you can smell the desperation coming from the TV companies,\" she suggests. \"So much has happened on this Big Brother, two people got thrown off the show, there have been constant rows, but it still feels like it's ending on a whimper not a bang. </p> <p>\"The same is true for the talent shows. Last Choir Standing is really wringing the format dry. Property shows are struggling. The water cooler programming, we're finding, is quality drama: Mutual Friends, for instance, has real word of mouth buzz as do Mad Men, Damages and The Wire. The problem The Family may find is that even though the intention may have been to make cerebral back to basics factual, it's being marketed like a reality show, the stroppy teen, the put-upon mum. You get the sense that it's TV companies saying 'we know you're fed up with wannabes, so we've picked a real family - so it's not Big Brother but secretly it's still got those reality rows you love'.\"</p> <p>In other words, reality TV has returned to its non-fiction birthplace - documentary - after invading light entertainment with The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing, arts with Operatunity, cookery and even business with The Apprentice and Dragons' Den. Entertainment shows, factual formats and reality have become so intertwined that, like pigs and humans in Big Brother creator George Orwell's Animal Farm, it's impossible to tell the difference - with the exception of Wife Swap which exists in a very specific genre known as Car Crash TV.</p> <p>In part, this is about the failure of the gameshow in the early 1990s. If a medium can be defined by the content it invented, theatre and the play, the printing press and the novel, then broadcast and the gameshow are entirely co-dependent.</p> <p>At the beginning of television's bawdy life, the gameshow was all about winning. An awestruck postwar west saw colour TVs, refrigerators and even family cars snapped up by contestants who answered the questions, spun the wheel and screamed with delight. By the late 1980s, the vast majority of viewers owned all of the above and more. Producers experimented with uberprizes, ITV's unsuccessful 1995 show Raise the Roof giving away an entire house; but ratings fell and shows were cancelled until Capital Radio's promotions manager David Briggs re-versioned the Bong Game, a breakfast show staple, and created Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.</p> <p>Millionaire wasn't about winning, it was about losing. The show's tension was created when a contestant gambled and lost. They called it jeopardy and commissioning editors couldn't get enough, from Weakest Link to Deal or No Deal. </p> <p>Around the same time, Peter Bazalgette created Changing Rooms and realised it too relied on jeopardy. \"It's the possibility that part of your home is out of your control and someone else will ruin it for you,\" he said at the time.</p> <p>Bazalgette's production company was absorbed by Big Brother producer Endemol and the company's UK chief executive, Tim Hincks, believes that all non-scripted TV is now about jeopardy.</p> <p>\"Shows like The Apprentice and Operatunity are reality shows for posh people,\" he argues. \"If they really were business programmes or arts programmes they wouldn't be hits. That's because audiences don't think like broadcasters and say 'I'm a specialist factual viewer', they want the journey and the jeopardy. That's what links Big Brother to Dragons' Den and that's why it's futile to ask if reality television is over. Whatever name or form it uses, the key element will always remain. What I think will change is the mediator. From a man in a dinner jacket explaining the world to you, we now have streamed rushes for Big Brother on E4. Online, that's even more obvious. That's exciting for creatives, especially for those who think that, like sexual intercourse, TV is better if you just get on and do it rather than talking about it all night.\"</p> <p>With The Family, Smith's removal of the crew and addition of 24/7 cameras supports Hincks's theory, although there is doubtless an acre or two of academic analysis about the role of editor as mediator to be written. And maybe the mounting irritation Morton and Davies feel at \"bear pit\" shows is because wannabes are playing to win. What they don't realise is that the British public may prefer to watch a loser.</p> <p><strong>Where did it all go wrong?</strong></p> <p><strong>1964<br>Seven Up!</strong><br>British reality TV is born - the first episode of Michael Apted's series introduced 14 British seven-year-olds, visiting them again every seven years - 56 Up is due in 2012. </p> <p><strong>1974 The Family</strong></p> <p>The BBC's fly-on-the-wall series films the Wilkinses as they go about their lives in Reading.

  "<p>When German publishing magnate Heinz Bauer snapped up Emap earlier this year, senior executives barely had a chance to shake hands with their new employers before one thing was made clear: the first rule of working for Bauer is that you don't talk about working for Bauer.</p> <p>Given the size of the company - in 2007 it was projected to turn over \u20ac1.79bn - it is surprising just how little leaks out of Bauer; publicly available information could fit on a side of A4. In fact, one morning after the takeover, Emap employees found a company biography of exactly that size on their desks: Bauer is a family-run company that owns 238 magazines in 15 countries and is now the largest consumer magazine publisher in the UK. It has TV and radio interests internationally too, with 12 million listeners in the UK following the Emap acquisition - and Magic in particular is now performing well at breakfast time with Neil Fox. They have been told little else since.</p> <p>Former Emap employees are not alone in wondering about the Bauers - since the company agreed to aquire Emap in December last year, the magazine and radio industries have been speculating about Bauer's plans for its UK acquisitions. But little has actually happened: two Emap magazines, First and NW (formerly New Woman) closed in February, but that decision had been in the pipeline long before Bauer took over. \"It was just a case of Bauer ratifying the decision really,\" said one source.</p> <p>A few executives have moved on, but it seems to be business as usual. Q magazine is being revamped, according to sources, and the firm is working hard on further integrating the magazines with their websites and radio stations. But Bauer HQ refuses to elaborate: \"Our ambitions for the business remain the same; to be media innovators who create and deliver influential brands that connect audiences with excellent content wherever, whenever and however they want it.\"</p> <p>But if the company is remaining tight-lipped about plans for its magazines and radio stations, it is even tighter lipped about the family behind Bauer. </p> <p>Many Bauer senior executives are made to sign a non-disclosure agreement on departure - and when MediaGuardian asked to interview Heinz Bauer, the firm's owner and chair since taking over from his father in 1963, following the \u00a31.14bn acquisition earlier this year, spokesman Christian Sommer said: \"That will not be possible. Bauer does not give interviews, ever. Each Christmas he holds a short press conference in Hamburg, where he gives out a few basic details on what the firm has been doing that year, and that is all.\"</p> <p>As the chairman of a wholly family-owned, private firm, which was started by his great-grandfather in 1875, of course, he doesn't even have do that. And according to one senior Bauer source: \"They guard their privacy incredibly jealously and take it very seriously. They are a private company in every sense of the word.\"</p> <p>Lori Miles, who left Bauer in 2004 after a 15-year stint working for the company during which she launched several magazines including Take A Break and TVChoice, is one of the few former employees happy to talk on the record. \"I have met Mr Bauer. He is a very shy man; that's probably why he has such a low profile,\" says Miles.\"He is softly spoken and is a proper, charming gentleman. But despite being quiet, there is no doubt when you meet him that he is a powerful man. Do you know that phrase, 'he speaks quietly, but he carries a big stick'? Well, that's Mr Bauer.\"</p> <p>A few months after the Emap deal, Bauer journalists in the UK said that few, if any, of the editors of what were Emap's prize possessions - super-selling consumer magazines such as Heat, FHM and Closer - had met Bauer, though the press office said that some senior managers and editors attended a Bauer conference in Hamburg in April. What is clear is that the key editors were taken for lunch in the UK by Saskia Bauer, the youngest of the four Bauer daughters (all of whom work for the firm - although in what capacity is debated.)</p> <p>According to several senior sources, at these lunches Saskia was not introduced as a Bauer employee, but as her father's emissary. \"As far as we've been told, she doesn't have an official role,\" said one. Others are adamant she was the architect of the Emap deal. All the Bauer press office will say is: \"[Saskia] assists her father across the entire Bauer portfolio, not just Bauer Consumer Media.\"</p> <p>Still only in her late 20s, Saskia is the daughter thought to be most likely to take over her father's job when he eventually retires. However, this may not be for some time - at 68, Bauer is said to remain an extremely smart and fit man. At his annual press conference last Christmas he emphasised he was not yet ready to retreat to an \"altenteil\" (a cottage on an estate reserved for parents). As for Bauer's other daughters, Nicola, one of the middle daughters, edits German gossip magazine In Touch; Mirja, the eldest, is publisher of German title Life &amp; Style - her husband, Sven-Olaf Reimer, is in charge of Bauer's online division; and Yvonne also works for the family in an executive role.</p> <p>But despite his daughters being on hand, Bauer is very much in the driving seat. According to one source, he flies over to London about once a month to check on the radio business, and went from desk to desk in at least one of the radio offices three months ago, introducing himself. \"I have spoken to Bauer at length about why he bought Emap and he says that actually it was the radio side of the business that they were most interested in,\" said the source. \"They are quite interested in the idea of taking a brand and transferring it across platforms, and in Europe Emap was a good example of doing it well. I think that was one of the core things that they were interested in.\" </p> <p>So while the brouhaha over the Emap sale focused on the magazines, it was the radio operation that held most allure for the Bauers, who previously only had minor radio interests with some stations in Poland. Another of the family's interests is flying: both Bauer and his wife have pilot's licences and own several planes and helicopters. Famously, Bauer once personally flew workers over a picket line during a strike. \"I remember going on one business trip to New Jersey, where Bauer flew us all over the Atlantic in his private plane,\" says Miles. \"He was the pilot and Mrs Bauer was the air hostess, serving us snacks and champagne.\"</p> <p>But, despite these extravagances, the Bauers have a reputation for parsimony, if not stinginess. \"We don't count beans, we count half beans,\" one German editor told Focus magazine. A Bauer insider told the Guardian that while Bauer is at No 410 on the Forbes rich list, with a net worth of \u00a31.9bn, he is not an ostentatious man. \"Whenever he used to visit New York his people had to make special arrangements so that he never found out the true cost of his hotel room. They would make arrangements in advance with the hotel management to change the room tariff on the back of his door.\"</p> <p>But editors from the \"old\" Bauer fold - which includes Bella and Take A Break - say no expense was spared on editorial. \"They let the creative people be creative and the money people do the money. I was once told 'Don't you ever tell me that you could have done something better if you had had more money',\" says Miles.</p> <p>An insider recalls the time a UK team went over to Germany to pitch a launch to Bauer. \"Before they even had chance to get out the dummies, he interrupted them and said 'will it work?'. They said yes, showed him the numbers, and without even looking through the dummies, he gave them the go-ahead.\"Bauer will take risks, as long as he is confident of the numbers.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street and the Treasury were forced to dismiss speculation of a rift between Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling after a Guardian interview by the chancellor prompted claims that the government had become dysfunctional.</p> <p>\"Relations between Gordon and Alistair are absolutely fine,\" said one No 10 source, while Treasury sources were also at pains to make clear there were no tensions.</p> <p>But the upbeat remarks glossed over a tense weekend in which Downing Street reacted with irritation to Darling's claim in his Guardian interview that the world economy is facing \"arguably the worst\" conditions in 60 years. Brown felt Darling had broken the first rule of law for chancellors: never speak in graphic terms. </p> <p>The chancellor's intervention could not have come at a worse time for Brown as he attempts to steady the ship following a rocky summer for the government. The contrast in tone between Darling and Brown, who always speaks cautiously about the economy, was seized on by the Tories even before the Guardian hit the news stands.</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, released a statement at 11.30pm on Friday accusing him of having \"let the cat out of the bag\" about the serious state of the economy. Osborne intensified his attack the following morning when he said that the contrasting language from Brown and Darling showed that the government was \"dysfunctional\".</p> <p>Darling's remarks were also greeted with incredulity by some in the Labour party, with one senior figure telling the Guardian: \"Alistair must be insane. There is no rhyme nor reason why he would want to talk like that. This really does show that we have a cabinet without leadership and which has given up the ghost.\"</p> <p>Brown spoke to Darling on Saturday morning and within hours a clearly chastened looking chancellor was wheeled out before the television cameras to deliver a prepared statement emphasising the government's two key messages: that Britain is suffering from a global economic downturn and that the government will be proposing measures to help people out.</p> <p>The two most senior members of the government were forced into action because they have been around long enough to understand one of the iron rules of British politics: if relations between Nos 10 and 11 deteriorate then the government as a whole has a limited shelf life. </p> <p>That was the lesson from Margaret Thatcher's downfall in 1990, which was triggered by the resignation of her chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1989. Osborne's use of the word dysfunctional was designed to draw a comparison with 1989 and 1990.</p> <p>It may be overblown to draw comparisons between Thatcher's relations with her chancellors and the current occupants of Nos 10 and 11 - Thatcher disagreed fundamentally with Lawson over key government policy on Europe and the poll tax.</p> <p>But while Brown and Darling share a virtually identical political outlook it is an open secret at Westminster that there have been tensions between the two men over the past year, though these have not become terminal. Darling believes he identified serious problems soon after entering the Treasury last year but was unable to win Brown's support for action before it was too late. The strongest example was the abolition of the 10p starting tax rate of tax, introduced by Brown in his last budget as chancellor last year.</p> <p>Darling pressed for early action on the grounds that it would hit the less well off. Brown said there was not a problem, a position he held to until Darling eventually borrowed \u00a32.7bn to solve the problem in May. It was against this background that Darling changed his operation earlier this year. He sharpened up his press team by hiring his old friend Catherine MacLeod, the respected former political editor of the Herald, to be his special adviser.</p> <p>The chancellor made clear that he was not attempting to brief against the prime minister. His aim was simply to carve out his own - loyal - identity which would strengthen his, and therefore the government's, position. The new approach explains why Darling agreed to break the rule of a lifetime and conduct an in-depth personal interview with the Guardian. Under the influence of his vivacious and razor sharp wife Maggie - a former Sunday Times investigative journalist who is also an old friend of MacLeod - Darling spent two days at his croft on the Isle of Lewis talking about life and politics to the Guardian's Decca Aitkenhead.</p> <p>Opinions were divided in the Labour party about the wisdom of such an interview. One former minister said: \"I thought Alistair talked very honestly. He is a very straightforward highly regarded member of the cabinet. But he must be feeling under pressure from the economy.\"</p> <p>MPs and ministers who believe that Brown has to stand down if Labour is to have a chance of winning the next election will use the Darling interview to claim that the centre is beginning to crumble. But they will keep their powder dry until after the party conference season. \"Gordon has a clear run until parliament returns in October,\" one senior MP said.</p>",
  "<p>Kelly Sotherton yesterday predicted that the man set to replace the national <br>performance director, Dave Collins, would shake up the sport. Collins will be officially relieved of his position today with immediate effect, six months before the end of his four-year contract, and Charles van Commenee, the Dutchman who guided Denise Lewis to Olympic heptathlon gold in 2000 and Sotherton to bronze four years later, is expected to take control.</p> <p>\"Some people will have a rude awakening,\" said Sotherton. \"He is a great coach, he has coached world and Olympic champions, he is very tough and he is not short of words.\"</p> <p>Infamously in 2004, minutes after Sotherton won the Olympic heptathlon bronze, Van Commenee said that she \"ran like a weasel\" in the 800m, the final event, and that she could have won silver. Sotherton burst into tears but later admitted he was right.</p> <p>Van Commenee, 50, the chef de mission of the Netherlands team at the Beijing Olympics, had been favourite for the position of UK performance director in 2004. At the time he was UKA's multi-events director but his no-nonsense style was seen by the sport's then regime as being too ruthless.</p> <p>\"Athletes are going in the right direction and he can add another dimension,\" said Sotherton after finishing sixth in the 100m hurdles in Gateshead. \"He did a great job in Holland. It is a shame he did not come here four years ago. There are only a few of us who know what he is like. He knows how to get results. He works hard and does not wait for things to happen. Nothing happens by chance with Charles - things happen because he makes them happen.\"</p> <p>Van Commenee is also a technical director of the Netherlands Olympic Committee. In Beijing the team won 16 medals, with seven golds, and finished 12th in the table, their second best Olympic performance. Last night he was unavailable for comment, but sources close to UKA insist he is the favourite for the position.</p> <p>Collins, a former sports psychologist, replaced Max Jones after the Olympics in Athens and always insisted that he should be judged after Beijing. Athletics has been handed more National Lottery funds in the past four years - \u00a326.5m - than any other Olympic sport but won only one gold in China, through Christine Ohuruogu in the 400m. The sport won four medals in total, one short of its target, but was overshadowed by cycling, among others, which won eight golds out of Britain's total of 19.</p> <p>The Olympics in London in 2012 will put a greater focus on athletics and Steve Ovett is interested in playing a role. It is 28 years since Ovett, now 52, won the Olympic 800m gold medal in Moscow but he said: \"If you can get guys like Charles, you need someone to back him up. I would love the job, there's no question about that, but you have to weigh up your life. I was thinking I could do it and I would love the job, but it's a question if I want it or not. There are a lot of people who could do that job.\"</p> <p>Ovett, speaking on BBC radio, said athletes must have a no-nonsense approach. \"They need a severe reality check as to what you need to do to survive and what you need to do to win,\" he said. \"But they need someone that, when they're out on the warm-up track just about to go out into the Olympic stadium, tells them: 'This is what you've got to do. No messing around, you're not going to fall off the back of the pace and just hang around and finish in eighth or ninth. We've supported you, you're good enough, get out there and start winning medals.'\"</p>",
  "<p>When you've been working with bullshit for as long as I have, you start to spot recurring themes: quacks and the pharmaceutical industry use the exact same tricks to sell their pills, everybody loves a \"science bit\" - even if it's wrong - and when people introduce pseudoscience into any explanation, it's usually because there's something else they're trying desperately not to talk about. But my favourite is this: alternative therapists, the media, and the drug industry all conspire to sell us reductionist, bio-medical explanations for problems that might more sensibly and constructively be thought of as social, political, or personal. And this medicalisation of everyday life isn't done to us; in fact, we eat it up. </p> <p>In 2007 the British Medical Journal published a large, well-conducted, randomised controlled trial, performed at lots of different locations, run by publicly funded scientists, that delivered a strikingly positive result: it showed that one treatment could significantly improve children's antisocial behaviour. The treatment was entirely safe, and the study was even accompanied by a very compelling cost-effectiveness analysis.</p> <p>Did this story get reported as front-page news in the Daily Mail, natural home of miracle cures (and sinister hidden scares)? Was it followed up on the health pages, with an accompanying photo feature, describing one child's miraculous recovery, and an interview with an attractive happy mother with whom we could all identify?</p> <p>No. This story was unanimously ignored by the entire British news media, despite their preoccupation with antisocial behaviour, school performance and miracle cures, for one very simple reason: the research was not about a pill. It was about a cheap, practical parenting programme.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for over five years now, newspapers and television stations have tried to persuade us, with \"science\", that fish-oil pills have been proven to improve children's school performance, IQ, behaviour, attention, and more. As I have documented with almost farcical repetitiveness in this paper, these <br>so-called \"fish-oil trials\" were so badly designed that they amounted to little more than a sham. In the case of the biggest, \"the Durham trial\", the county council has refused even to release the results, which I have every reason to believe were unflattering.</p> <p>I'm not desperately interested in whether fish-oil capsules improve children's IQ, and I say this for a number of reasons. Firstly, I'm not a consumer journalist, or a lifestyle guru, and I am not in the business of handing out \"readers' health advice\". Also, if you think about it rationally, any beneficial effects of fish oil on school performance will probably not be all that dramatic. We do not have an epidemic of thick vegetarians, and humans have shown themselves to be as versatile as their diets are diverse, from Alaska to the Sinai desert.</p> <p>But I wouldn't start with molecules, or pills, as a solution to these kinds of problems. The capsules Durham are promoting cost 80p per child per day, while it spends only 65p per child per day on school meals, so you might start there. Or you might restrict junk-food advertising to children, as the government has recently done. You might look at education and awareness about food and diet, as Jamie Oliver recently did very well, without recourse to dodgy pseudoscience or miracle pills. </p> <p>But you might also step away from obsessing over food just for once and look at parenting skills, teacher recruitment and retention, orsocial exclusion, or classroom size, or social inequality and the widening income gap. Or parenting programmes, as we said right at the beginning. In fact, Durham's GCSE results, where the \"trial\" was performed, improved far more in the year before the fish-oil pills were introduced, after a huge input of extra funding and, more importantly, extra effort from local teachers and the community. But the media don't report stories like that: because \"pill solves complex social problem\", even if it's not true, is a much better angle. </p> <p>The fish-oil story is by no means unique: repeatedly, in a bid to sell pills, people sell a wider explanatory framework, and as George Orwell first noted, the true genius in advertising is to sell you the solution and the problem. Pharmaceutical companies with serotonergic antidepressant drugs to sell have worked hard, in their direct-to-consumer advertisements and their lobbying, to push the \"serotonin hypothesis\" for depression - the idea that low serotonin causes low mood - even though the scientific evidence for this theory is growing thinner every year. Meanwhile the nutrition supplements industry promotes dietary deficiencies as their treatable cause for low mood.</p> <p>But this fish-oil story is also a classic example of a phenomenon more widely described as \"medicalisation\", the expansion of the biomedical remit into domains where it may not be helpful or necessary. In the past, commentators have portrayed this as something that doctors inflict on a passive and unsuspecting world, an expansion of the medical empire; in reality, it seems that these reductionist biomedical stories can appeal to us all, because complex problems often have depressingly complex causes, and the solutions can be taxing and unsatisfactory.</p> <p>In its most aggressive form, this process has been characterised as \"disease-mongering\". It can be seen throughout the world of quack cures - and being alive to it is like having the scales removed from your eyes - but to understand its relevance to the pharmaceutical industry, we need a quick primer in medical history. </p> <p>Before 1935 doctors were basically useless. We had insulin, morphine for pain relief - a drug with superficial charm, at least - and we could do operations fairly cleanly, although with huge doses of anaesthetics, because we hadn't yet sorted out well-targeted muscle-relaxant drugs. Then suddenly, between the 1930s and the 1970s, science poured out an almost constant stream of miracle cures. </p> <p>Everything we associate with modern medicine happened in that time: antibiotics, dialysis, transplants, intensive-care units, heart surgery, every drug you've ever heard of, and more. For people who were ill, the difference was spectacular. If you got TB in the 1920s you died, pale and emaciated, in the style of a romantic poet. If you got TB in the 1970s, then in all likelihood you would live to a ripe old age. You might have to take rifampicin and isoniazid for months on end - they're not nice drugs, and the side-effects make your eyeballs and urine turn pink - but if all goes well you will live to see inventions unimaginable in your childhood.</p> <p>Times have changed. The pharmaceutical industry is in trouble: the golden age of medicine has creaked to a halt, the low-hanging fruit of medical research has all been harvested, and the industry is rapidly running out of new drugs. Fifty \"novel molecular entities\" a year were registered in the 1990s, but now it's down to 20, and many of those are just copies of other companies' products, changed only enough to justify a new patent. So the story of \"disease mongering\" goes like this: because they cannot find new treatments for the diseases we already have, the pill companies have instead had to invent new diseases for the treatments they already have. </p> <p>Recent favourites include social anxiety disorder (a new use for SSRI antidepressant drugs), female sexual dysfunction (a new use for Viagra in women), the widening diagnostic boundaries of \"restless leg syndrome\", and of course \"night eating syndrome\" (another attempt to sell SSRI medication, bordering on self-parody) to name just a few: all problems, in a very real sense, but perhaps not necessarily the stuff of pills, and perhaps not all best viewed in reductionist biomedical terms. In fact, you might consider that reframing intelligence, loss of libido, shyness and tiredness as medical pill problems is a crass, exploitative, and frankly disempowering act.</p> <p>Selling us crude biomedical mechanisms may well enhance the placebo benefits from pills, but these stories are also seductive precisely because of what they edit out. In the media coverage around the rebranding of Viagra as a treatment for women in the early noughties, and the invention of female sexual dysfunction, for example, it wasn't just the tablets that were being sold: it was the explanation. </p> <p>Glossy magazines told stories about couples with relationship problems who went to their GP, and the GP didn't understand their problem (the first paragraph of any medical story in the media). Then they went to the specialist, and he didn't help either. But then they went to a private clinic. Here they did blood tests - hormone profiles, esoteric imaging studies of clitoral bloodflow - and then they understood. The solution was in a pill, but that was only half the story, and the diagnosis was almost more important: she had a mechanical problem Rarely was there a mention of any other factors, that she was feeling tired from overwork, that he was exhausted from being a new father, or finding it hard to come to terms with the fact that his wife was now the milky mother of his children, and no longer the nubile sex vixen he first snogged on the floor of the student union building to the sound of Don't You Want Me? by the Human League in 1983. </p> <p>This is because we don't want to talk about these issues, any more than we want to talk about social inequality, the disintegration of local communities, the breakdown of the family, the impact of employment uncertainty, changing expectations and notions of personhood, or any of the other complex, difficult factors that play into the apparent rise of antisocial behaviour in schools.</p> <p>This wishful deafness to the clamour of reality reaches its purest form in our newfound obsession with food, as if it was the most important lifestyle risk factor for ill health, as if every technical detail should be devoured and acted on, for the promise of eternal zest. From the Daily Mail's ongoing project to divide all the inanimate objects in the world into ones that either cause or cure cancer, to daytime television's obsession with the healing power of this week's magic berry, there is no end to this material. Should you believe it? No. I have demonstrated time and again how these claims are flawed in their own specific cases. But something more interesting is being ignored in the background. </p> <p>The World Health Organisation's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health reported this week, and it contained some chilling figures. Life expectancy in the poorest area of Glasgow - Calton - is 28 years less than in Lenzie, a middle-class area just eight miles away. That is a lot less life, and it isn't just because the people in Lenzie are careful to eat goji berries for extra antioxidants, and a handful of brazil nuts every day, thus ensuring they're not deficient in selenium, as per nutritionists' advice. </p> <p>People die at different rates because of a complex nexus of interlocking social and political issues including work life, employment status, social stability, family support, housing, smoking, drugs, and possibly diet, although the evidence on that, frankly, is pretty thin, and you certainly wouldn't start there. </p> <p>But we do, because it's such a delicious fantasy, because it's commodifiable and pushed by expert PR agencies, and in some respects this is one of the most destructive features of the whole nutritionist project, graphically exemplified by figures such as Dr Gillian McKeith PhD. Food has become a distraction from the real causes of ill health, and also, in some respects, a manifesto of rightwing individualism. You are what you eat, and people die young because they deserve it. You hear it from people as they walk past the local council estate and point at a mother feeding her child crisps: \"Well, when you look at what they feed them,\" they say, \"it's got to be diet, hasn't it?\" They choose death, through ignorance and laziness, but you choose life, fresh fish, olive oil, and that's why you're healthy. You're going to see 80. You deserve it. Not like them.</p> <p>Genuine public-health interventions to address the social and lifestyle causes of disease are far less lucrative, and far less of a spectacle, than anything a lifestyle magazine editor or television commissioner would dare to touch. What prime-time TV show looks at food deserts created by giant supermarket chains, the very companies with which the stellar media nutritionists so often have their lucrative commercial contracts? What glossy magazine focuses on how social inequality drives health inequality? Where's the human interest in prohibiting the promotion of bad foods, facilitating access to healthier foods by means of taxation, or maintaining a clear labelling system? </p> <p>There is no glamour in \"enabling environments\" that naturally promote exercise, or urban planning measures that prioritise cyclists, pedestrians and public transport over the car. There are no votes, it seems, in reducing the ever-increasing inequality between senior executive and shop-floor pay. When do you ever hear about elegant ideas like \"walking school buses\"? Somewhere near you, a softly spoken public-health official has probably tried to interest your local paper in a story on them; presumably the latest urgent food-fad news left no space.</p> <p>We love this stuff. It isn't done to us, we invite it, and we buy it, because we want to live in a simple universe of rules with justice, easy answers and predictable consequences. We want pills to solve complex social problems like school performance. We want berries to stop us from dying and to delineate the difference between us and the lumpen peasants around us. We want nice simple stories that make sense of the world.nd if you make us think about anything else more complicated, we will open our mouths, let out a bubble or two, and float off - bored and entirely unphased - to huddle at the other end of our shiny little fishbowl eating goji berries.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This is an edited extract from Bad Science by Ben Goldacre, published by Fourth Estate today at \u00a312.99.

  "<p>When Sheila Fitzgerald, 50, went back to work last year, she was a full-time mother who had not set foot in an office for 10 years. \"It felt daunting because the workplace had moved on, as well as the technology,\" she says. \"I was concerned about not fitting in, I was concerned not exactly about being old ... but about not being a new young recruit.\"</p> <p>Fitzgerald is the mother of three daughters, aged between 10 and 15; her husband Brian Lysaght, 47, works for Bloomberg News. It took her five years in all to find a job similar to the one in corporate communications that she had left a decade before - she is now a manager in a technology company in south west London. \"It wasn't an all-out job hunt but when I saw something, I'd apply, with basically no results. I just got rejections. It did undermine my confidence because I wondered about my age and the gap in employment.\"</p> <p>Three years ago, she read about Women Like Us, a recruitment company in north London, her local area, which specialises in retraining. \"I remember thinking, I'm a professional - I wouldn't really require that sort of assistance. I know how to write a CV. But then a couple more years went by, I was feeling desperate and questioning my employability. I went to some of their interview workshops which were incredibly helpful.\"</p> <p>No one really talks about working life after full-time motherhood. It is just assumed that women might eventually drift into badly paid part-time work - if they can land a job at all. But there are growing signs that women are unhappy with this limp status quo and are instead seeking second-chance careers where they can actually use their skills. In America the trend already has a name: relaunching. Last year a guide to being a \"woman returner\" came out called Back on the Career Track, by Carol Fishman Cohen and Vivian Steir, two mothers who had six-year career breaks before going back into investment banking and head-hunting. And last month, New York-based novelist Meg Wolitzer, 49 - who has been described as the female Philip Roth - took on the subject. The Ten Year Nap is an addictive examination of the minutiae of the lives of four women friends who find themselves at odds over what to do after 10 years out of the workplace.</p> <p>Wolitzer herself has two sons, Gabriel, 17, and Charlie, 13, and is married to science writer Richard Panek, 50. She never stopped working - it's easier for a writer, she admits over the phone - but was fascinated by the lives of the high-flyers turned stay-at-home mums she met at the school gates. </p> <p>The \"nap\" of the title has raised hackles. It is not meant to be a dig, Wolitzer says: in fact, one of the recurring jokes in the book is that these full-time mothers live their lives on a tight schedule. Their alarm clocks go off before their husbands' so that they can get up and make packed lunches, and they are constantly rushing between pick-ups and playdates. \"The rest of the world doesn't fall away when you have children,\" says Wolitzer, \"But your priorities are with your family. You're not exactly asleep but you're in the dream of family life. I wanted to ask - what happens when that shifts and the world returns to you?\" Wolitzer had some concerns about writing about a privileged minority: those who can afford not to work. \"I'd been judgmental before I really got to know some of these women,\" she says. \"They were mostly women who had worked in the corporate world and realised when they had children that the idea of going back to a world that they hadn't loved - and which hadn't loved them - made them feel more than reluctant. I'd always felt that everybody would find their passion in life and it was kind of na\u00efve to think that was true. I was very moved by some of these women's lives and their conflicts.\"</p> <p>In the UK, 55% of women with a child under the age of five are employed (according to the Office for National Statistics). The figure rises to 79% when the youngest child reaches 16. On some level then, re-launching has always happened. But the fact is that we very rarely hear about these women or the obstacles they face, says Kate Grussing, founder of recruitment consultancy, Sapphire Partners. Grussing, 44, is a former banker with four children aged between seven and 13. She set up her company in 2005, and it specialises in finding people flexible work, job shares and maternity cover, recruiting and headhunting for City firms, law companies and corporates such as Pepsi and Colgate. </p> <p>Many of the women on her books have had a \"nap\" of at least five years - some as many as 10. \"It's incredibly common here but even more so in the US. Over there, maternity leaves are short, vacation time is non-existent and childcare is poor. The factors are different in the UK but there are thousands of women in the same boat. We see a huge number of women who planned to go back after the second baby but then moved house or had elder-care issues and suddenly they look up and five, seven, 10 years have passed.\"</p> <p>One of Sapphire Partners' own recruitment consultants, Alison Downey, 48, has had two eight-year career breaks in between raising her two daughters, now 18 and 21. Originally a solicitor, she has reinvented herself to get back into work: \"I never took a conscious decision to stay out that long. Each time I've gone back has been through personal contacts: I'd always kept talking to people and when something came up that I wanted to do, I did it.\"</p> <p>She wishes now that she had kept her hand in a bit more to facilitate the return. \"There are a lot of challenges. Your confidence ebbs when you're away. You come back and things have changed: for example, this time when I came back I was working in an open-plan office for the first time ever. But there are advantages too. When you're on a career ladder, it's difficult to step back and think about what you really want to do.\"</p> <p>There is a downside to all this, says Lynda Gratton, professor of management practice at London Business School. \"It drives me mad that we talk about \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" for women [ways to make leaving and returning easier]. Men want them too. Why should women be the ones who are expected to look after the children? This is the problem in our society - and business colludes with it.\" Career breaks and reinventing yourself are not just for women or for parents, she argues, but for everyone. After all, in the future it's expected that many more people will take sabbaticals and downtime. \"Most of us will work into our late 60s,\" says Gratton, \"and careers are becoming more fragmented. But anybody who takes a break is always going to find it difficult to get back in. You need to have a strategy - do part-time work, stay in touch with your work community, go on training programmes. You can't take five years off, turn up and say, 'Now I want to start again.'\"</p> <p>Heather Stork, 38, from Guildford, Surrey, is all too aware of this and is putting her strategy in place. The mother of Annabel, five, and Thomas, three, she has not worked for seven years (her husband, Matthew, 39, is managing director of a medical company). Stork was laid off from her job in investment banking at Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis of 2001 and had not found another job by the time she became pregnant with her daughter. \"Once I had my children it was very difficult to think about leaving them to go back to work,\" she says. \"If you have maternity leave you have something to go back to. Otherwise you just get used to family life. I was incredibly focused on making sure that my children could get the best care possible ... Now they are on their way to school and I see there is the possibility of relaunching a version of the career I had.\" She doesn't think it would be possible to get back into investment banking, though, because the hours are so long. \"I would be looking at getting two nannies.\"</p> <p>She started her job search earlier this year, looking for something in financial consulting. She has had three interviews and has not quite found what she is looking for yet. \"It's difficult to read people's reactions. Two of the companies didn't focus on my career break at all. But at the other place they were very interested in what I did during the time off. It's hard to explain without seeming like you've been so in charge of the household that you don't want to leave it.\" She plays up the advantages of her time off: \"In many ways I do feel my skills have increased: I have done fundraising, been involved in my daughter's school and I have helped friends start small businesses. It's just a matter of convincing an employer that I have not been completely out of touch with what's going on in the world. Which I think is a real misconception anyway: there are loads of women who are intelligent and ambitious but not out there earning money.\"</p> <p>It is these very women that have started to interest big business. Susie Mullan, HR director at management consulting company Accenture, explains: \"The upside is that you are recruiting people with multiple years of experience before their career break - so you are getting that intellectual capital back. We are looking at ways to connect with women who might have been out of the workplace for longer than a year or two. If we can't find a way to stay connected to them, we lose the opportunity to retain some key talent.\" But companies are just as keen not to lose these women in the first place: \"We do see a lot of people off-ramping to two or three days a week, working flexibly or taking a less high-profile role. As their children get older, then they start back on the career track.\"</p> <p>Women can't possibly hope to go back in at the level they were when they left, though, can they? \"Correct,\" says Grussing, curtly. But employers do appreciate the maturity, loyalty and enthusiasm these women have, she adds. And they get executive-level skills at a negotiable price (usually as a trade for flexibility): \"I'll be honest - it's far easier for us to place a woman who has had a shorter career break. The average is three years. For the women at the 10-year end of the spectrum, their experience is probably not as relevant. But we should give these women help because it's important for the economy. Plus, we see a lot of women who have taken time out and never plan to go back. And then, guess what? They're widowed or divorced.\"</p> <p>Often these \"napping\" women are doing executive-level things anyway. \"One City woman I know took a career break after her second child and ran the PTA at the largest independent school in London for three years,\" says Grussing. \"She has been managing diverse stakeholder groups and doing a lot of fundraising. And she inherited money where she has a trustee responsibility and so had to get up to speed on charity laws. She has this fantastic experience. Schools, churches and voluntary organisations benefit hugely from this pool of women.\"</p> <p>Relaunching is not just about getting back into the City, though. Nina Goldsack, 42, has three boys under the age of eight. An army wife from Wiltshire, she left her career in risk-management consultancy because her husband was posted abroad. Now back in the UK, after nine years not working she is re-training to be a maths teacher. \"The whole 'going back to work' thing is a big deal,\" she says. \"When I applied for the course, I found myself saying, 'Well, I did a maths degree 20 years ago and I can provide you with a reference from someone I worked with 18 years ago . . .' You start to wonder if you are bringing anything valuable to them. But it seems a lot of people are in this situation. Some of the teachers I have been with so far are people who have come to it mid-life as a second career, so that helps.\"</p> <p>It took Goldsack years to reach the decision to go back to work at all. \"It became a massive soul-searching exercise. Did I want to go back to what I did before, but in a compromised way? You realise that you will have to retrain, be at a lower level and give up a lot of what you've had with the children. I thought I didn't want that enough. You think: how much am I prepared to give up? Do I have to spend thousands of pounds on courses, take five years to qualify and then find I have a new career where I will not be there for the children at all?\"</p> <p>She is currently taking a PGCE with the Open University. \"It has definitely worked out for me: it is so stimulating and I do want to go out and do something. But I talk to other mothers and they don't necessarily agree. Having come this far and compromised a lot, they feel they don't want to compromise anything at all. I know other people who tried to go back and said to me, 'It's really difficult. The sooner the better.' It's mainly to do with the experience you had being worth virtually nothing because it's too long ago. But I know a lot of people who are retraining. It has been a huge shock for me to realise that most of my friends have not let themselves get into this position. They have kept something going that is rewarding - they have not taken several steps down the ladder.\"</p> <p>At the end of The Ten Year Nap the message is deliberately ambiguous. It is a novel, after all. \"This wasn't going to be a polemic or a handbook about how you should live your life,\" says Wolitzer. Two of the women - including Amy, the main character - go back to work full-time. Two decide to remain full-time mothers. But none of them really achieve what they had imagined for themselves 10 years previously. That, Wolitzer, suggests, is life: none of us get what we want. But she is obviously partisan, concluding in the book that, when it comes to a career: \"One day you just woke up and knew there was somewhere you needed to be.\" </p> <p>Wolitzer suspects the culture may have moved on since she finished writing the book anyway. \"I wanted to mark this moment in time, but I think it is changing. I did a radio show recently and fathers were calling in and saying things like, 'I have an equal partnership with my wife.' This hasn't happened for the men I know in their forties but I can see it happening with younger guys. Men are finding great pleasure in being home with their children.\" Maybe in the future we'll all be taking 10-year naps.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>More about women in the workplace <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/money\">theguardian.com/money</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Television</strong><br><strong>Go west, young exec</strong><br>The law of America states a successful British executive will eventually try their luck across the Atlantic. And so it is that BBC fiction controller Jane Tranter is considering a job running BBC Worldwide's productions in Los Angeles.</p> <p>But, to paraphrase Mrs Merton, just what is it that attracts the Brits to the glamorous, sun-soaked lifestyle and big pay packets of the US TV industry?</p> <p>Stories are rife of showrunners and executive producers on big shows such as American Idol earning north of $500,000 (\u00a3274,000) an episode. And with rewards that make Jonathan Ross's wages look like peanuts, it's no wonder British producers are tempted to cross the pond. Management earn less than those behind the camera, but still, US companies pay around double UK salaries. One British executive who worked for a major network was earning more than $1m a year before family commitments forced him back to these shores. </p> <p>US networks pay more because they have a bigger market - they invest around $250m on pilots they expect to shelve. As Tom Gutteridge, the founder of LA and London-based Vine Media, says: \"They also commission faster. And have more resources. When I worked on Paradise Hotel in America, we had 24 edit suites, compared with the two you usually get in the UK.\"</p> <p>Plenty of Brits have made it in the US, such as ex-The Last Resort producer, now HBO Films chief, Colin Callender. And Nigel Lythgoe, former Big Brother producer Conrad Green, ex-Gladiators producer Ken Warwick and former Ant and Dec producer Georgie Hurford-Jones have, between them, overseen American Idol, America's Got Talent, and Dancing with the Stars. </p> <p>But if you make the move, don't brag too much. In the ruthless US market your show can be axed instantly - leaving you shamefaced on the next plane home.</p> <p>Writer Steven Moffat only found out NBC was cancelling the US version of Coupling \"when I read it on the internet\". Michael Grade flopped as an independent TV producer in LA in the early 80s. He admitted: \"I thought I was tough, and by British standards I was, but in LA I was out of my depth.\"</p> <p>But Tranter is renowned for her resilience. Plus she will have the backing of BBC Worldwide. It seems unlikely she will end up agreeing with Moffat's description of working in LA: \"We thought it was not much fun. Frankly, we should get off our knees about America.\"<br><strong>Tara Conlan</strong></p> <p><strong>China</strong><br><strong>Cool commission</strong><br>As the dust settles after the Beijing Olympics and reporters move on, media executives are left looking for business opportunities in the People's Republic of China. ITN On - the multimedia wing of ITN - has signed a deal with the Shanghai Media Group to produce 50% of the content for a new show, Cool Edition, on the country's largest English-language channel. </p> <p>The 10-minute-long, magazine-style show will air at 6.30pm Monday to Friday on ICS, which has a daily reach of 18 million. It is aimed at a young, professional, English-speaking Shanghai elite, and will carry details of - you guessed it - all things \"cool\", from west to east. </p> <p>The International Programme Content Network (IPCN), the 14-month-old independently owned company that brokered the deal, believe this is the largest commission from China for any UK company. </p> <p>ITN On's contribution to Cool Edition will feature fashion, music, sport, celebrities, and \"the five coolest facts of the day\" from the UK, according to Mick Desmond, the chairman of IPCN. A Chinese producer will mix the British broadcast with local content. </p> <p>\"If there is something fantastically cool that has happened in the world that day, that will be reported as well. But there is so much going on both in the UK and China that there will be enough fantastic facts and cool stories each day. It's easy to put together,\" says Desmond.</p> <p>An advert on the IPCN website calls for a presenter for the show who can demonstrate \"trendy, funky, cool, attractive presenting styles\".</p> <p>Doing business in China is not a simple process, and there are plenty of regulatory flashpoints for media hopefuls. A magazine-style show about east/west coolness is safe enough to get past the censors, but, Desmond admits, \"hard news would be a very different proposition\".</p> <p>Nicholas Wheeler, managing director of ITN On, is confident that Shanghai-dwellers are just itching to watch what's going on in Cool Britannia. He believes that the success of the Olympics is evidence that the Chinese are learning English on a large scale and are \"interested in the rest of the world and how it works and what we do\". </p> <p>He also points out that \"Shanghai is a very westernised, urban, groovy sort of place\".</p> <p>So, as long as what's \"cool\" in the UK continues to revolve around celebrities, sport and fashion rather than, say, democratic freedoms, Cool Edition looks set to be a success.<br><strong>Heidi Blake</strong></p> <p><strong>Student press</strong><br><strong>What Bullingdon pic?</strong><br>Politicians are no strangers to old stories from their student days resurfacing - from Bill Clinton not inhaling to Tony Blair's Ugly Rumours - but today's students are acting to expunge any potentially damaging skeletons in their digital closets even before they are famous.</p> <p>As editor of the Oxford Student newspaper last year, I received a call at least once a week from students past and present asking to remove their names from online articles. The calls increased after the photograph of David Cameron and Boris Johnson trussed up in \u00a31,200 tailcoats for the 1987 portrait of the Bullingdon Club turned up. </p> <p>It's unlikely that the young Cameron had considered the fact that membership of this highly elitist club might damage an attempt to rebrand the Conservative party several decades later, but current members of a university that has provided 25 prime ministers obviously are. Last March, news organisations were banned from republishing the 1987 photos.</p> <p>When, during his leadership bid, journalists unearthed an article the Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne wrote for Isis magazine condoning the use of hard drugs, Huhne said he didn't remember writing it, although it bears his byline. </p> <p>Last year, one former history student took issue with a gossip page from 2003 that claimed she slept with someone because of her involvement in student politics. Now hoping to progress in a political career, she said: \"I hope to be pretty high profile and this won't look good if I succeed.\"</p> <p>Student misdemeanours can attract a lot of attention, as Ben Tansey, PPE student and ex-president of the Oxford Union knows. Last year, a penchant for drunken naked wrestling landed him in the student papers - and the Daily Mail. \"Last summer I had an internship at a major bank and was reprimanded for my appearance in the press,\" he said.</p> <p>Oxford Gossip, an online forum where people could anonymously post gossip about their peers, was recently forced to delete all content, and shut down last year amid threats of legal action.</p> <p>Perhaps Oxford students are sensible to limit the fallout before it happens. On the other hand, Boris Johnson freely admitted that after the Bullingdon Club photo was taken, \"the party ended up with a number of us crawling on all fours through the hedges of the botanical gardens trying to escape police dogs\". Last time I checked, he was doing fine.<br><strong>Samira Shackle</strong></p>",
  "<p>Kenny Miller returned to haunt Celtic yesterday, scoring twice in his first Old Firm derby since returning to Rangers in a dramatic match that saw both sides reduced to 10 men. Victory was just the tonic Rangers needed after their disappointing start to the season.</p> <p>After an embarrassing Champions League exit to Kaunas in the second qualifying round and the subsequent sale of his club's best player, Carlos Cu\u00e9llar, Walter Smith could have been for forgiven for facing this match with some trepidation.</p> <p>But the Rangers manager need not have worried. His players were inspired by Pedro Mendes, a player whose \u00a33m arrival from Portsmouth was facilitated by Cu\u00e9llar's \u00a37.8m exit, and scored four at Parkhead for the first time since New Year's Day in 1994.</p> <p>Miller, back at his old stamping ground, can now lay claim to a unique double, having broken his duck for Celtic in this very fixture two years ago. \"If that doesn't win the fans over, I don't know what Kenny needs to do,\" said Smith of the Scotland striker, whose summer move back to Rangers prompted dissenting words among the Ibrox club's support. \"We were just pleased to get the goals, no matter who scored them, but it is funny how things like that happen in football.\"</p> <p>Miller's latest East End show had been rather upstaged before kick-off by the news that Daniel Cousin would partner him in attack. It proved a masterstroke by Smith, Cousin opening the scoring, although he was later dismissed for collecting a second yellow card. Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink made it 10 men apiece moments later after kicking out at Kirk Broadfoot.</p> <p>Smith described Cousin's second yellow card as \"innocuous\" but the Gabon forward was guilty at least of poor judgment in jumping into Stephen McManus having already been booked. \"The referee had a good game,\" added Gordon Strachan, the Celtic manager, apparently content that the normally placid Vennegoor of Hesselink had been similarly reckless.</p> <p>Cousin brought a mundane first half to life on 37 minutes, ghosting past Mark Wilson on the Rangers right before shooting low past Artur Boruc at his near post. The hosts were level within two minutes, though, Georgios Samaras capitalising on Sasa Papac's inability to clear by finishing from close range.</p> <p>What Strachan described as \"some bizarre goals and one excellent strike\" followed, but not before Shaun Maloney came within inches of edging Celtic in front. Miller went one better, meeting Kevin Thomson's cross with a sweet angled volley that left Boruc helpless.</p> <p>Crucially, the creative skills of Mendes came to the fore while those charged with generating guile for Celtic, namely Aiden McGeady and Scott Brown, cut anonymous figures. Unsurprisingly it was Mendes who produced the brilliance Strachan later lamented. Just after the hour mark the midfielder, who earned a recall for Portugal last week, met a Steven Davis corner first time, thundering in a low shot from 30 yards. </p> <p>Cousin's final indiscretion arrived 15 minutes from time, though Celtic's hopes of taking advantage were soon dashed by Vennegoor of Hesselink, on as a substitute just five minutes earlier. Worse was to follow as Boruc dropped a routine Broadfoot cross right at Miller's feet, and the striker needed no second invitation. The muted response of Shunsuke Nakamura as he curled a stoppage-time free-kick home said it all: this not was Celtic's day. </p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Kenny Miller (Rangers)</p> <h2>The dismissal derbies</h2> <p><strong>August 31 2008 Celtic 2 Rangers 4</strong></p> <p>Rangers goalscorer Daniel Cousin gets two yellows and Celtic substitute Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink evens things up after four minutes on the pitch</p> <p><strong>February 7 2001 Celtic 3 Rangers 1 </strong></p> <p>In this CIS Cup semi-final a brawl sees Claudio Reyna, Michael Mols and Lubo Moravcik get their marching orders as a Henrik Larsson-inspired Celtic </p> <p>sweep past their Old Firm rivals </p> <p><strong>March 29 1997 Celtic 0 Rangers 1 </strong></p> <p>Rangers striker Mark Hateley and Celtic's Malky Mackay ensure a 10-a-side affair, while Paolo Di Canio and Ian Ferguson engage in wrestling</p> <p><strong>March 17 1991 Celtic 2 Rangers 0</strong></p> <p>This Scottish Cup quarter-final at Celtic Park, dubbed the St Patrick's Day massacre, descended into farce with the Rangers trio of Englishman Terry Hurlock, Mark Walters and Mark Hateley sent off, while the Celtic midfielder Peter Grant also enjoyed an early bath.

  "<h2>Poland</h2> <p>The Polish film poster has a unique place in the world. The circumstances of modern Polish history have conspired to create an environment where the advertising of cultural events was able to dominate the popular visual culture of the post-war period.</p> <p>The annexation of Poland by the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the second world war and after the brutal period of German occupation, condemned the country to a further period of totalitarian dictatorship. The command economy imposed by the Soviets was unable, or unwilling, to deliver the material surpluses which might have raised living standards and supported the beginnings of consumer culture and advertising. In the event, Polish graphic designers were faced with little option but to work for the state.</p> <h2>Film in Poland</h2> <p>The Polish film industry was able to prosper in spite of these difficult conditions. In addition to its own productions, producers were able to establish collaborations with the industry in Western Europe, especially in France and Italy. At the same time, the country remained open to mainstream films from the west.</p> <p>The nationalised, or state owned, distribution of films allowed Polish film posters to develop in a unique way. The usual considerations of star-billing and genre, imposed by the legalistic classification of assets within the commercial film industry in the west, could be largely ignored.</p> <h2>Posters</h2> <p>The Polish film poster is generally distinguished by an integration of image and text that is unusual within the normal arrangements of film advertising.</p> <p>This integration is characteristic of the modern poster and was facilitated by the development of lithography at the end of the 19th century. The French posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, for example, exemplify the beginnings of this tradition where hand-drawn lettering and image making combine into a single, seamless, semiotic presentation.</p> <p>By the 30s, the increasing mechanisation of the lithographic printing process enabled the development of symbolic typo-photographic elements in poster advertising. The relatively austere formal simplifications implicit within this development were continued, after second world war, in the post-Bauhaus international typographic style of the Swiss modernists. These developments in graphic design transformed the activity into one of technocratic specification and moved poster design away from the artistic production of expressive design.</p> <p>In Poland, the political and economic circumstances of the 40s and 50s encouraged artists to continue working in the beaux-arts tradition of pictorial and artistic lithography. Photographic image making and mechanical reproduction remained little used.</p> <p>It was fortunate that, from the 30s onwards, a generation of Polish artist-designers had been formed within the beaux-arts tradition of poster design. The French school of poster design, that had been dominant before the second world war, influenced these artists.</p> <p>In Poland, the legacies of the war and the political circumstances of the 50s allowed for an expression of a psychologically darker and more complex sensibility. By the 60s, these themes of a subjectivity informed by sexual identity and violence had become mirrored in the narratives of new-wave and independent film making around the world.</p> <h2>Cul de Sac</h2> <p>The poster for Cul de Sac, directed by Roman Polanski in 1966, is by Jan Lenica. Lenica was an important member of the Polish school of graphic design and worked as a cartoonist, animator and poster designer. The cut-out lettering and loose brush-work of his poster perfectly express the claustrophobic intensity of the protagonists' developing relationship. The triangulation between the woman, played by Francoise Dorleac, the intellectual and the man-of-action is expressed through the semiotics of heart, gun and spectacles.</p> <p>Dorleac was the sister of Catherine Deneuve and part of the Anglo-French 60s scene. In contrast to the hedonistic appetites and consumption of the swinging sixties in London, the Polish scene expressed itself though a connection to nihilistic scepticism.</p> <p>Some commentators have understood Polish film posters to be an expression of cultural resistance to Soviet oppression. In fact the posters are much more profound; they represent the mass-entertainment of the cinema as something altogether more complex and tragic.</p>",

  "<p>Flowing black beard, a headband with <em>\"Allahu akbar\"</em> (God is greatest) and a fluttering green flag. This has been the trademark picture of the recent <em>azadi</em> (freedom) processions of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir\">Kashmir</a>, where hundreds of thousands marched the streets of this disputed Himalayan region seeking a separation from India.</p> <p>From a distance, it seems as if the past has returned to Kashmir. But the present contains an irrefutable truth: in place of guns, the people carry slogans. The politics of protest this time is not about the argument of power, but about the power of argument.</p> <p>Kashmir is the first conflict-ridden Muslim region in the world where people have consciously made a transition from violence to non-violence, and this includes the staunch Islamists too. In fact, the wisdom behind the use of arms to fight a political struggle was being silently debated within Kashmir ever since 9/11 blurred the lines dividing terrorism and genuine political movements. The deteriorating situation inside Pakistan too had tilted the balance towards a peaceful struggle. </p> <p>Thus when Kashmiris decided to come out to demand <em>azadi</em> recently, there were no militant attacks or suicide bombings. It was through massive unarmed processions where people shouted slogans and waved flags. And when the government tried to halt them, the anger was only manifested through stone pelting. Sensing the overwhelming public mood, the militant groups immediately declared a unilateral ceasefire, admitting the insignificance of the gun for an unarmed people's movement.</p> <p>This major shift has not been registered even as it has already formed a new discourse for Kashmir's separatist struggle. New Delhi's response was usual \u2013 it again used its iron fist, killing 38 unarmed protesters and injuring more than a thousand and enforcing a strict curfew with a hope that the people will be ultimately cowed down. The separatist leadership too was rounded up.</p> <p>This only shows that New Delhi is misreading the script. This time the authorities are not faced with gun-wielding men but unarmed people. A heavy clampdown keeping the population indoors only puts a temporary lid on the seething anger. Instead of a military intervention, New Delhi should have immediately attempted sincere political and democratic means to engage Kashmir and calm the tempers.</p> <p>New Delhi's approach to handling Kashmir for past two decades has been simple and straight: militancy is the only problem and that can be sorted out by stringent military measures. Though there have been several rounds of negotiations with a faction of the separatist leadership too, New Delhi used the process more as a photo-op than a serious effort to address the demands of the people. There have been half a dozen occasions when separatist leadership joined a dialogue with New Delhi to resolve the Kashmir problem amicably \u2013 only to find the exercise nothing more than a surrender and thus futile.</p> <p>The distrust towards New Delhi had reached such proportions that when moderate separatist leader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirwaiz_Omar_Farooq\">Mirwaiz Umar Farooq</a> decided to join talks with New Delhi, his uncle was murdered in Kashmir. Despite a serious threat to his life, he joined the talks directly with the prime minister of India. Again, the non-serious approach of New Delhi derailed the process, further eroding the credibility of talks with New Delhi in the eyes of Kashmiris. The public standing of separatist leaders who had agreed to talk to New Delhi also diminished substantially.</p> <p>The recent protests by hundreds of thousands of unarmed people too don't seem to have changed the mindset of New Delhi's ruling elite. Instead of acknowledging the intensity of the uprising and the depth of the sentiment in Kashmir, New Delhi again refuses to face the reality and delays engaging in a sincere dialogue with the separatist leadership. The Kashmiris have overwhelmingly announced that peaceful processions and not guns are now their favoured means of protest. This needs to be encouraged and allowed to take firm roots because it could help to put an end to the bloodshed in Kashmir and make an amicable resolution of the problem easy. The phenomenon could also have a positive influence over a dozen such violent conflicts in other Muslim regions across the world. But if peaceful protests are crushed like armed movements, another wave of violence will take root, reinforcing the idea that the gun is mightier than a slogan.</p>",

It is only a small step then to argue that as business types, from private security forces to real estate speculators, made a mint out of the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">Hurricane Katrina</a> disaster in New Orleans, why not suspect that they wanted, indeed willed, the levees to collapse? Did they actively engineer the wild weather, too? </p> <p>Some theories are truly \"out there\", but then it is useful to tar any criticism of the powers that be or the way things are with that same brush. Calling critical comments or unsavoury revelations \"conspiracy theories\" automatically turns them into the fetid conclusions of the paranoid.</p> <p>Or so some might hope. The first allegations of British complicity in the CIA's extraordinary rendition program, by letting their white kidnap airplanes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/ciarendition.sa&quot;\">land and fuel up</a> at our airports, was simply shrugged off as a \"conspiracy theory\" by the British government. That the charges were borne out by investigations by organisations from Liberty to the European Parliament has led not one official to be rendered culpable.</p> <p>The logic behind many a conspiracy theory runs: the suspect has \"previous\", and as they cannot or will not disprove the allegations, it is safer to assume their guilt. So in 2003, the idea that the forthcoming Iraq war was all about oil \u2013 George W Bush being a ex-oil executive, heading a cabinet of ex-oil executives, running the world's biggest gas-guzzling country and seeking to invade an oil-rich country as global demand soared and supplies peaked \u2013 was just a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/15/foreignpolicy.k&quot;\">conspiracy theory</a>\", or so said Tony Blair. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the case for invading Iraq was itself quite the boldest conspiracy theory, concerning the threat from Saddam's stockpiles of WMD. Saddam had \"previous\" for mass murder, a history of megalomaniacal duplicity, and his protestations of having destroyed any WMD couldn't be believed \u2013 or better, proved, as you can't prove a negative. We all know the rest. We're still there. </p> <p>Are our leaders then simply conspiracy theorists, trying to seek order out of a chaotic world they can't control, frustrated and fearful of being marginalised by their own incompetence and the murderous, meaningless chaos that surrounds them? Are \"they\" not really just like \"us\"?<br> Robin Tudge is co-author of The Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Howard will be here at around 3.45pm ahead of the 4pm kick-off.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Obviously, it's all Gareth Barry versus Rafa Benitez, but here is the supporting cast:</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa</strong>: Brad Friedel, Luke Young, Martin Laursen, Curtis Davies, Nicky Shorey, Nigel Reo-Coker, Stilian Petrov, Gareth Barry, Ashley Young, Carew, Agbonlahor. Subs: Brad Guzan, James Milner, Marlon Harewood, Zat Knight, Moustapha Salifou, Wayne Routledge, Craig Gardner.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool</strong>: Pepe Reina, Alvaro Arbeloa, Jamie Carragher, Martin Skrtel, Andrea Dossena, Dirk Kuyt, Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano, Leiva Lucas, Robbie Keane, Fernando Torres.

This reveals two things: firstly that a generation of miserable teenagers is now employed by Rupert Murdoch to make video montages, and secondly that this country has been starved of real creatively-anguished artists for the past 25 years.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Getting the excuses in early</strong><br>This minute-by-minute application is seriously knacked with the technical gremlins causing all kinds of havoc. It took me half an hour to write that last entry which, let's face it, wasn't worth 30 seconds of anyone's time.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>And another ten minutes for that last one.</strong> Anyway, James Milner is on the bench for Villa; Barry starts. Liverpool have gone with ... well, the teams are written down there, figure out where they're all playing yourself. Assuming they've not been deleted from your screen by this destructive application, which is erasing everything I write as if a PacMan gobbling fruit.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Liverpool get it under way in their ghastly all grey kit with red socks that is scarcely improved by the fuzzy picture on this telly.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>9 mins: </strong>I haven't seen any of this match yet, thanks to the computer knack. But it's getting me some love from you lot: \"I feel sorry for you with the I.T problems,\" sympathises Danny Cassidy. \"Do you think it is the millennium bug finally hitting?\" Could be, although on the other side of the desk Lawrence Booth is characteristically unruffled during his OBO cricket coverage, which is using the exact same software that broke Paul Doyle's resolve earlier and is putting mine under some strain. \"Villa to win 3-0, Gareth Barry hat trick,\" continues Danny, who also conveniently adds: \"He has to score and without Stevie G MBE Liverpool don't have a clue,\" which gives you some more team news, no thanks to me.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>13 mins: </strong>Villa seem to be having most of the possession in the early stages, although Torres wins an early corner when he tries to drag in a cross from the left and it's deflected behind. Martin Skrtel and all the other big men go up, only to watch Martin Laursen make a comfortable clearance. </p> <p>\"This day is finally here!\" proclaims George Templeton. \"And oh how I've waited for this match to arrive. For months I've had to watch my team's club captain get tapped up in the most brazen way imaginable and watched my club be treated like trash and had to listen to Liverpool fans blather on about how they are in the Champions League and they are a proper big club and blah, blah, blah! Well after all of this bull Gareth Barry is still a Villain despite the best efforts of the Scouse show pony $teven Gerrard and his fat maitre'd manager, Rafa Benitez! Well its a damn shame that Gerrard isn't fit today because that will be the excuse the Aston Villa stuff the Scousers into the Villa Park turf like a sledgehammer driving in a railroad spike!\"</p> <p>Oh, and Saun Wright-Phillips has scored for Man City to put them 2-0 up.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>15 mins:</strong> Martin Skrtel goes through the back of Gabriel Agbonlahor and picks up a yellow card. The Villa front men are dropping off well to collect whatever they're being fed from the midfield, although getting wide with the likes of Ashley Young would certainly seem to be the best policy against the narrowest of all narrow sides in the Premier League this year.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Barry finds some space in the middle and lifts a pass onto the noddle of John Carew. He tries to flick on for Gabriel Agbonlahor, but the three-time love rat (according to a red top newspaper that is not endorsed by the Guardian in any way, and might not actually be telling the truth) can't get onto it. Back at the match, Lucas fires a shot hopelessly high and wide.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>21 mins:</strong> Robbie Keane is playing out on the left here, which seems to be a token attempt, at best, to give Liverpool some width. Torres is more isolated than ever up front and, Liverpool fans, this is not looking to be any improvement on what's gone before so far this season, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>25 mins:</strong> Liverpool are playing at the very edge of the final third but getting nowhere else as Villa have the edge of their penalty area well policed. They go sideways right, sideways left and nowhere else. </p> <p>Adam James has got a big wooden spoon out, stuck it into a bubbling pot of claret and blue ire, and stirred: \"What a lot of Villa fans such as George Templeton don't understand is that most Liverpool fans a) have the utmost respect for Villa and always have done even though truthfully they aren't in the Champions League and b) didn't really want Liverpool to sign Barry because Alonso is better. What price at the bookies for a Barry own goal?\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>27 mins: This from the bad-to-worse department: </strong>Fernando Torres has just hobbled off with obvious hamstring knack. He tried to spin around Nicky Shorey to latch onto what might be described as a through ball, but pulled up obviously injured. No $tevie Mbe and now no Torres. Ryan Babel is on.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>31 mins:</strong> Scrap that, actually it's David Ngog on for Torres. He's a huge, young French striker with bags of promise, according to the Liverpool website. He is also the cousin of Jean-Alain Boumsong, which brings all the former into doubt. \"George Templeton sounds to me like the kind of guy who blames the new lad when his girlfriend leaves him,\" says Johnathan Kaszynski, who I won't be calling for a pint the next time I'm dumped. \"Liverpool didn't have to tap Barry up, he wanted to go.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>33 mins: </strong>Ngog leaves Martin Laursen looking like cousin Jean-Alain as he turns him inside out on the right flank and dumps the Dane on his rear. He gets no further, though. At the other end, the first clear cut chance of the match falls to John Carew who is fed the ball eight-yards out from Ashley Young after the winger wriggles to the byeline. Carew only has Reina to beat but side-foots straight at the Spanish keeper who saves with his legs.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Dirk Kuyt thwacks one into the side netting after a long cross from the left grazes Nicky Shorey's hair and falls into the Dutchman's path. Robbie Keane was screaming for it in the centre, but Kuyt has a dig. Meanwhile: <strong>Outraged Liverpool fan writes: </strong>\"Perhaps you can pull your thumb out of your [rude word], and try and give some balanced opinions. How many times a season does a top four team only take control of a game like this in the second half? How often to opposition teams put everything into the first 60-70mins? You've clearly got it in for LFC just admit it you [very rude word], kindly remove yourself from this coverage and get someone who's actually interested in the game not LFC bashing to take your place.\" I'd love to remove myself from the coverage, believe me, but I'm the most impartial we've got, since I actually hate Villa as well.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>42 mins:</strong> Ngog has looked lively up front and lifts a shot onto the top of the net after muscling Curtis Davies off the ball. Soon after, Javier Mascherano has a surging run from midfield but leaves Kuyt with too much to do from a poor layoff to his right.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> A disappointing first half dribbles to a close with Reina plucking a fairly aimless free-kick out the sky. The big news is the Torres injury and still a lack of width from Liverpool, despite Benitez deploying Keane on the left and Kuyt on the right. Your emails are coming during the break.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>George Templeton versus the Villa baiters: </strong>\"I know Johnathan Kaszynski's statement is a windup, but I will respond anyway. Barry's head wasn't turned until the England friendlies. Before last season was over Martin O'Neill made it clear that he wanted to give Gareth Barry an extension and keep him at the club and Barry sounded pretty receptive to it. Then come the qualifiers (and all that quality time with $tevie MBE) and all of sudden Barry is coming out in the press, criticizing the manager and in general acting like a prima donna (which he's not). The idea that Gareth Barry wanted to go from the start is flatly untrue!\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Ian Truman self-deprecates:</strong> \"Is Rafa somehow trying to assemble the slowest team in the league? We spend \u00a330m (somehow) on two less than pacey strikers and then put them on the left and right wings. We then replace two slightly underperforming but decent fullbacks with two slow and [rude word] ones. I want to cry.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>From the \"Why doesn't Rafe Benitez get this simple point\" department?</strong> \"It's incredible, it really is,\" says an incredulous Samuel Zakowski in an email headlined \"Ryan Babel\". \"You have the guy who gives you width, ideas, penetration; who gave you one decent cross in midweek against<br>the champions of my country; who is the only player in your squad besides Torres with imagination and unpredictability. You put him on the bench. Babel on, if Liverpool want to win. Or they should buy Wilfried Dalmat, Standard Li\u00e8ge's right winger, who absolutely murdered Fabio Aurelio.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> Liverpool get an early corner after Luke Young heads a Xabi Alonso hoist into the penalty area high over his own goal. Make that two, when Young does the same to the first corner. The second effort is better and has Brad Friedel ambling into no man's land and the American is grateful to Curtis Davies who beats Kuyt to the cross and clears.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> Another Alonso corner, this time from the right, precipitates a game of ping-pong after Dossena drives one into the mixer. It falls to Reo-Coker who powers up the other end and eventually wins a corner for Villa. Carew wins the header in the middle, but it glances off Skrtl and over.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>52 mins: </strong>Twice close from Liverpool, the first time Robbie Keane gets some space in the box, back to goal. He feeds Alonso, whose shot clips Nicky Shorey's heels and goes over. Then Dossena whips in a deep cross from the left that has Friedel scrambling beneath his bar to paw away.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>55 mins: </strong>I'm not sure if this is a new thing, but Sky now have a scrolling \"fact bar\" that sometimes pops up on the screen containing, well, facts. This latest fact tells us that Villa have not been involved in a goalless draw for more than a year, which actually sounds more like a desperate plea to viewers to stay tuned in rather that just a harmless info nugget. Pressure from Villa, meanwhile results in a corner which Ashley Young sends drifting over the heads of Agbonlahor and Carew and away for a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Robbie Keane has given up on the left wing and is now scampering across the field up front. He gets a kick in the ankle for his troubles and loses out as Agbolahor tries to break. He's upended by Skrtl, who is already on a yellow.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>59 mins: </strong><strong>This game has got 0-0 written all over it</strong>. There, I'm prepared to say it if it will ensure a goal.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>61 mins:</strong> Dirk Kuyt wrestles Ashley Young to the ground wide on the Villa left Young gets up to whip a perfect free kick onto Curtis Davies's head. But the centre-back <em>might</em> have got a slight nudge in the back as he nods wide. Nothing given.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>63 mins: James Milner makes his (second) debut for Villa</strong><br>The former Newcastle man jogs on to replace Luke Young to very quiet chants of \"There's only one James Milner!\" from three or four Villa fans.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>67 mins:</strong> Dossena gets booked for throwing the ball away after a throw-in is (wrongly) awarded to Villa. Yep, apart from an almighty hoof out of defence from Martin Laursen, that's the most exciting thing that's happened in the past four minutes.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>70 mins:</strong> This has descended into some woeful long-ball stuff, which is more forgiveable from Villa since they at least have a couple of big men up front with a slight chance of winning a header. Stilian Petrov's name is heard on the commentary for the first time - is there a more anonymous player in the Premier League? - and Rafa Benitez finally makes another substitution. It's Babel, right? Wrong. It's Fabio Aurelio, for Dirk Kuyt.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> Is that brilliant by Nigel Reo-Coker or absolutely awful from Robbie Keane? A bit of both, probably, but the former Tottenham man misses a great chance to open his Liverpool account. Mascherano (I think) hoiks a massive long ball over the Villa defence and Keane is clean through. But he waits for ages for the ball to drop, to steady himself, and to pull the trigger, by which point Reo-Coker has scampered across and got his leg in. Keane miskicks and it skews wide.</p> <p>\"I hate the way this game is going,\" says George Templeton. \"Villa (much like Standard Liege) should be ahead but haven't taken their best chance and even though Torres and Gerrard aren't on the field I have this very sick feeling about another late goal from Dirk Kuyt allowing Liverpool to get away with the points.\" Kuyt's off, but the email came through before that, and is otherwise valid, I think.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>78 mins: </strong>Yossi Benayoun is on for Robbie Keane, who fails to see the end of another match. Craig Gardner, who has had the odd goal from the bench in his time, is on for Villa in place of someone I didn't see. \"It's frustrating, isn't it?\" says Alan Cooper, who also noticed that I'd been talking about Martin Petrov instead of Stilian, so earns internet publication as his reward. \"If this potential 0-0 draw for Liverpool were following a 0-0 draw at Sunderland (almost happened), a home draw, or even loss, against Boro (ditto), and a Big Cup exit as well (ditto), then it would be crisis time at Liverpool. Instead, a 0-0 here is a decent result. And, knowing them, they'll probably score a late, lucky winner.\" It could happen. Yep, it definitely could happen.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>82 mins:</strong>Slightly more excitement now as both teams seem to realise that there are a shiny three Premier League points up for grabs if anyone has any interest in claiming them. There's an anxious moment for Martin Laursen, who is forced to play it back to his goalkeeper after being hassled by Benayoun. Then a snap-shot from Milner is comfortably collected by Reina.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>84 mins:</strong> A long free kick from the half-way line lands on the head of Martin Laursen and his header loops <em>that</em> far over the bar with Reina beaten. Actually, it was actually only <em>this</em> close, rather than <em>that</em> close, but we've been so starved of action today that <em>that</em> counts as excitement.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>87 mins:</strong> Petering out, or preparing for a last-gasp Gareth Barry in-your-face thunderbolt? Er, the former.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>89 mins:</strong> Chance for Barry to write all the headlines as Fabio Aurelio fouls Ashley Young and allows the Villa pariah to hoist one into the box. It misses all the Villa heads, but a Liverpool one heads it towards his own goal before it's cleared.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> David Ngog, who started brightly but fizzled like a wet sparkler just had a chance to run at the Villa defence, but instead thumped it at the corner flag. Two painful minutes of injury time, in which any Liverpool shot would be their first on target of the match. Villa have been scarcely better and I wish those techie gremlins had permanently nixed this.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>92 mins:</strong> And that, mercifully, is that. Let's forget this ever happened, all right.</p>",

Hurrah!</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1.28pm:</strong> Before the teams enter the pitch, the Brazilians in Chelsea's backroom staff stop to embrace Spurs keeper Gomes. Terry and King, meanwhile, exchange a frosty handshake, with the courageous England captain studiously avoiding eye contact with his old mucker.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Chelsea get the game under way and it quickly becomes apparent that Bosingwa is not, in fact, in midfield, rather Belletti seems to be a sort of holding midfielder just behind Essien. Lampard marks the passage into the second minute with a blazing shot into the stands.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> The good news for Spurs fans is that, with Gunter at right-back, Zokora has been restored to his least destructive position of central midfield. Further good news is that Bosingwa has just chopped down Bale to give Spurs a free-kick near the left-hand corner flag. Bentley curls it in, and Lampard heads it out.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>5 min: </strong> Magnificent save by Gomes, who arched backwards to tip Lampard's wonderful lob just over the bar!</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Lovely, zippy interplay between Giovani and Modric culminates with the former tricking his way past Belletti and into the box. Carvahlo comes across to put the ball behind for a corner. Bentley's delivery is again swept clear by Lampard.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> It's a high-tempo, entertaining game so far \u2013 a little too high-tempo for Deco, who's just been booked for a late tackle on Giovani. He reacts by frowning in a way that makes him look even more like Malcolm in the Middle.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Another rapid Chelsea move ends with another Lampard shot \u2013 this was his worst one so far, hurtling well wide. At this point, the emptiness of my inbox leads me to make like Pink Floyd and croon: is there anybody OUT THERE?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 min: </strong>Essien collapses in the box after a sliding tackle bu Gunter - \"play on\" mouths the ref, and rightly so. \"I had the strangest dream the other day where a bunch of idiots in suits decided that Petr Cech, John Terry and Frank Lampard were each the best in Europe last season in their respective positions,\" shrieks Chris Kempshal in a cold sweat. In fairness Chris, that was the result of voting not by bureaucrats, but by the managers of the sides who reached the knock-out stages of last season's Champions League., including, it's true, ace football brain Avram Grant.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> That match has now settled into a pattern: Chelsea monopolizing possession with Spurs defending doggedly while remaining primed to break quickly, as Modric just did there, releasing Bentley, whose shot was deflected out for a corner. Again it fails to beat the first man. \"I'm here,\" squeals Michael Nelson, possibly like that bloke from Are you Being Served? \"As a Spurs fan, I've spent the last few weeks waiting for the inevitable result of our hubris (fourth place, it's a shoo-in). It's a blessing that after Boro (!!) and Sunderland (!!!!!) thankfully we finally have someone we can lose to respectably.\" You're certainly a respectable second best so far in this match, Michael.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> A Chelsea corner triggers anarchy in the Tottenham box, as defenders scramble to clear shots form Terry and Anelka. They survive. \"Man, am I sick of Spurs uncertainty?\" asks Big Brian McMahon, to which I can only respond \"I don't know, are you?\". \"Yes, no doubt about it. Having said that, they'll probably make about eight transfer deals over the next 36 hours.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Belletti picks Anelka out with a cunning throughball. The Frenchman takes it down nicely but then wallops his shot over the bar rom 18 yards. \"Im a Chelsea fan from Kosovo,\" announces Roshan. \"I felt sad for your empty inbox and felt the obligation to write you few lines, with an urgent question. Do you have any clue why is Belletti playing at all, and secondly why is he playing where he is playing?\" Well, Mikel and Ballack are injured, Sidwell was sold, Jody Morris was rightly run out of the club and into oblivion years ago, and, in fairness, he's doing fine there so far. It's perhaps just as well he's not any closer to the defence.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Essien cracks the bar with a thunderous, swirling shot from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>28 min: Chelsea 1-0 Spurs (Bellettti 28')</strong></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Deco swung in a corner that Spurs felt should never have been awarded. Darren Bent showed his discontent in a novel way at the near post, angrily whacking thin air rather than clearing. The ball ricocheted off Belletti and into the net! A spawny goal for Chelsea, but their dominance makes it a deserved one.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Chelsea continue to lord it over their increasingly ragged inferiors. Deco whips in another corner, carefully aiming for Bent, who this time manages to connect with the ball and steer it away from the danger zone. \"So that I don't have to worry about the outcome of Chelsea games I've deliberately not included any of their players in my Fantasy Football team,\" blubs the unfortunately named Henry Loveless. \"Now I'm being trounced by less moral managers who have. Can we have a separate league please (presuming I'm not alone)? It can be called the \"cut off your nose to spite your face\" league?\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> It's all Chelsea. The rare Spurs efforts to venture forward inevitably founder on the rock of Bent's poor control. If only Tottenham had a genuinely class striker who can both hold the ball up and play off defenders' shoulders. Apparently there's a decent Bulgarian who matches that description but I can't for the life of me remember his name. \"I am at work due to the fact that we work Sundays in Dubai,\" boasts Peter Ward. \"Why do Spurs keep signing below average players and selling them to below average clubs in the Premier League? They are literally polluting our game with terrible acquisitions. From today's squad Zokora, Gilberto, Dawson and Assou-Ekotto will probably all end up at a lower to mid-table team. Chances are it will be Sunderland. And one last thing to Spurs fans, you are not everybody's second favourite club. We all hate you and you are second only to Newcastle in the deluded fans league table.\" You seem to be somewhat deluded yourself, Peter: Zokora, Gilberto, Dawson and Assou-Ekotto are already at a lower-table team. You don't get much lower than bottom, after all.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Gunter and Bentley swap neat passes down the right before the full-back sends in a cross that's put behind for a corner. Bentley finally manages to get a bit of height on it, but Woodgate is penalised for jumping all over Carvahlo.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Cech charges out of his goal to prevent Bent from latching on to a hopeful clearance from the back. \"So before the season started everyone was saying that Modric and Dos Santos were too small and lightweight for the Prem,\" recalls Steve Mitchell. \"I saw both play <br>last weekend and that didn't seem, to be particularly the case. Modric seemed to slip a few hefty challenges, while Dos Santos has puppy fat and can hardly be called lightweight. What's the verdict today?\" Both seem perfectly able to handle themselves, Steve, and both have been full of energy and enterprise. They have been at least as (in)effective as their bigger team-mates (who aren't especially numerous, it must be said). Their main problem has been that Spurs haven't been able to get enough of the ball and, simply, that Chelsea are much better.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 min: Chelsea 1-1 Spurs (Bent 45')</strong></p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> For a technological reasons to annoying to repeat, there was a delay in transmission right there. Guardians boffins insist it was nothing to do with the shock of Bent finding the net. Didn't have a good view of the goal because I was punching my computer screen at the time, but apparently a Modric pass deflected conveniently off Lampard and into Bent's path. The striker, whose deadliness has never, ever been doubted on this page, slotted the ball under Cech for a sensational equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> I'm going to beat up some boffins. Back soon, once justice has been served.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> We have resumption. No changes. By the way, the cameras have just revealed that Fabio Capello's in the crowd. Let's hope the last minute of the first half convinces him to start with Darren Bent up front against Andorra and Croatia. Oh yes.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Giovani loses possession in his own half, to Deco of all people. He knocks it to Essien, who finds Ashley Cole free at the left-hand side of the box, and Cole fires a low shot just wide.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> After a nice, patient move by Spurs, Bale rollicks down the left and wins a corner after his drilled cross is deflected behind. Bentley's delivery is decent, but again Woodgate is penalised for a clumsy jump.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Ridiculous shot by Bosingwa, whose 20-yard effort was a danger only to astronauts.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Spurs are playing with renewed vigour in this second half and Chelsea are struggling to breach them despite constant pressure. Lampard has just tried to repeat his fine lob of the first half, but this one sailed over the bar. \"I am not sure about the Deco as Malcolm in the Middle line,\" confesses Alan Cooper. \"I have been advocating Deco as Ronnie Corbett. Do you think that could catch on?\" Are you sure your first name is, Alan, and not Alice? (By the way, the person who really is an exact replica of Deco is French rugby chap Dimitry Yachvili).</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> By the way, since Bent has been copping plenty of stick in recent weeks, it is perhaps worth pointing out that Anelka has been plod for Chelsea so far this season, and, unlike Bent, he can't blame a lack of support. He's done lots of scampering today, but sod all else.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> The match, in a nutshell: Tottenham can't get out of their half, but Chelsea can't into their box. Correction\" Tottenham have, in fact, just got out of their half - but shouldn't have bothered, because Bentley's subsequent cross was woeful.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Spurs substitution: Giovani off, Lennon on.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Lampard lines up a free-kick from 40 yards and hammers it \u2026 straight into the wall. Unprofessional, simply unprofessional. \"OI! Where is Roman Pavlyuchenko?\" demands Connor Clarke. I don't know, Connor, presumably off enjoying the London drizzle somewhere. He's certainly not in the squad today.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Spurs substitution - Gunter off, Huddlestone on. Zokora trots over to the bench to ask whether that meanshe's to go to full-back again ...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Carvahlo nuts a Lampard corner over the bar. And with that, Scolari makes his first change, withdrawing Joe Cole to throw on Florent Malouda. Scared, Spurs fans? Didn't think so.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Lampard is being silly now \u2013 he's simply shooting from everywhere and anywhere, ignoring team-mates in better positions. He's lost the head.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Malouda receives the ball on the left and as he's about to try to take on Jenas (who's at right-back rather than Zokora), Huddlestone lumbers across and fouls him. Deco wastes the free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Spurs continue to pile sandbags around their box and so far it's working for them and Chelsea, shamefully, cannot summon the guile to pick a way through. If only the battering ram that is Didier Drogba was here, eh? \"This has to be one of the few fixtures of the year where, as far as we Arsenal fans are concerned, we can only win,\" gushes Kenny Pryde. \"Chelsea lose? Great result. Spurs lose? Another great result. A draw? Great. If only it was like this every weekend.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>73 min: </strong>Spurs substitution - Bentley, who has been disappointing out on the left, is replaced by Jamie O'Hara.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> O'Hara's first contribution to the game is not clatter into Ashley Cole and leave him writhing in agony on the ground. Brings a tear to your eye, so it does. \"I read somewhere that Pavlyuchenko is back in Russia after signing,\" spurts Steve Mitchell. \"Maybe he forgot to back his toothbrush?\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Chelsea change \u2013 Belletti off, Kalou on.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Like Liverpool, Chelsea are reacting to the growing pressure by going ever longer. It almost paid off for them just now, as Anelka flicked on a Terry punt. But Kalou flashed a diabolical shot into the stands.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Spurs venture forward for the first time in ages, and with more composure and slickness than Chelsea have shown in this second half. Bale and Modric combine nicely to win a corner. Which is wasted as usual.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Buoyed by Chelsea's impotence, Spurs are now showboating, knocking the ball around tauntingly. They're making no more inroads than Chelsea have done, but are at least killing time.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Bale gallops down the let and slaloms past Bosingwa and Carvahlo before the former recovers sufficiently to trip him up. Free-kick to Spurs on the edge of the box, on the right-hand side. Anti-climatiaclly, Bale clips it straight into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Woogdate concedes a free-kick on the half-way line. Before it can be taken, Scolari takes off Anelka and introduces Di Santo, Then Carvahlo smashes the ball into the box. And Gomes collects it easily.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Four minutes to be added \u2026</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> King gets his head to another Chelsea punt, but Lampard latches on to the dropping ball \u2026 and then tumbles under a challenge by Woodgate! No penalty, reckons the ref, and he's right.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Another neat move by Chelsea but yet again it ends with a shot from outside the box. Essien's effort trickled wide.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full-time: </strong> Spurs discovered a defensive spine. Chelsea lacked penetration. There endeth today's lesson.</p>",
  "<p>\"How much do you get paid?\" This is the first question I am asked by many of the A-level students I meet as part of a Muslim mentoring programme for schools in underprivileged areas of North London. </p> <p>Although they ask with a cheeky smirk, in the eyes of many of the students a satisfactory answer would cement my credibility as a mentor. Most are of Somali, Pakistani and Bengali origin, and the mentoring scheme kicks off in their first year of A-level study with the purpose of helping to motivate the students academically by providing successful examples of the fruits of a good education. If they make enough money, that is.<br> Upon closer acquaintance, it appears that most of the students need very little academic motivation. They are second-generation immigrants whose families encourage them to perform and go to university in order to secure a good job and a healthy livelihood. If anything, they need motivation to take up more extra-curricular activities and be more involved with pursuits that would allow them to explore their talents and personal aptitudes. Every single one of the students in the programme was planning to enrol in either a science or maths-based discipline (except one girl, who wanted to study English and asked sheepishly whether an English degree would help her secure a lucrative role in today's job market).  This favouring of \"proper jobs\" and the academic application that facilitates them is not unknown in Arab and Asian communities. Indeed, where I went to high school and university in Egypt and Sudan, academic streams were clearly divided into \"science\" and \"art\", (the latter encompassing everything from humanities to social sciences to \"soft\" sciences such as geology) and never the twain did meet. Under considerable social and familial pressure, most of the gifted students opted for medicine, engineering, business studies and their offshoots, while the rest reluctantly enrolled in what were perceived as less prestigious subjects like politics and languages.  Inevitably, this separation has a materialistic goal. The students from North London see a stable job with a title as their ticket out of poverty and into affluence (and I am hardly one to speak, having resisted pressure from my family to study medicine in favour of politics \u2013 only to end up in finance). This in turn increases their eligibility for marriage and enhances their position as a respectable member of the community. </p> <p>More importantly however, there is also a certain suspicion that befalls an intelligent person who takes up literature, say, rather than medicine. The more artistic pursuits are viewed as disreputable irrespective of how lucrative they are, almost harking back to a time when artists, poets and musicians were jesters and eunuchs in the court of those with real purpose, the decision-makers who showered coins on the heads of their foppish entertainers in payment for distraction from the real business of living.<br> Dedicating oneself entirely to what are perceived to be Bohemian self-indulgent pursuits smacks of a lack of discipline, of application, of perhaps perturbingly unique thought that breeds moral suspicion.  Men who shun more mainstream roles are viewed as either effete or unreliable for lacking the mettle to pursue these roles. Although female students opting for less mainstream academia and careers do not meet as much resistance (for the much of the prestige of certain jobs is tied to male machismo), the perceived moral dubiousness of more ostensibly licentious courses is in evidence. At an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/14/women.islam\">Islam Expo session</a>, Maleiha Malik called upon Muslim families to allow and encourage their daughters to take up sports, drama and music instead of shoehorning them into more sober careers. The issue in this case goes beyond promoting what is perceived as good career-wise for these students and into the realm of prohibition for no reason other than \"it is not done\". In this case, even extra-curricular activities are discouraged. <br> Ironically, pursuits such as writing and poetry are celebrated when dabbled in on the side, when they can be viewed as a manifestation of all-round ability and intellectual dexterity. Members of royal families in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are accomplished poets and one of the most popular TV programmes in the Middle East is <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/middle-east/2007/03/poetry-achievement-pinnacle\">Millions Poet</a>, a Pop Idol themed poetry competition. <br> In the UK, this Spartan/Athenian split is less in evidence. I tried to explain to the students that they were lucky to be born and live in a society where they could expand their horizons and think more laterally about what academic life they wish to follow without it necessarily impacting their earning potential or compromising the respect they would like to earn. There are disciplines that require strict training such as medicine but many university graduates have successful careers in law and finance after gaining totally unrelated degrees and in the process of doing so expanded their horizons and cultivated themselves into more flexible, balanced and adaptable members of the workforce. These individuals not only contribute more to a role than single minded ones but are free of the technocrat's tunnel vision.  This sadly, did not really resonate with the students of North London and I felt that the ideal of the Renaissance man was very much a luxury here in communities confounded by materialistic realities and deeply ingrained cultural perceptions of success.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Mornin', and welcome to another exhilarating ride on the good ship KP. England, you may recall, went 3-0 up at The Oval on Friday and are talking bravely about a 5-0 whitewash - a result, believe it or not, that would take them up to second in the world rankings. South Africa would clearly rather be back home already and may not be too disappointed that it's currently chucking it down in St John's Wood. The bad news is the skies are heavier than Rob Key; the good news is the Lord's drainage is as slick as Mark Nicholas's hair gel. Needless to say, we'll be the last to bring you all the news, comment and gossip.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>While you're waiting for the action to start (and I'm sure you're all sitting at your laptops as I write), why not have a quick gander at Vic Marks's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/31/englandvsouthafrica2008.englandcricketteam\">match preview</a>, which was a brave piece to write given the weather forecast.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>10.50am</strong> The day just gets better. I've just diluted my coffee with lumpy milk, despite a best-before date of September 6. The only alternative in Guardian Towers appears to be semi-skimmed goats milk. I, er, kid you not. The covers are still on at Lord's and David Gower is asking one of his very long questions which in fact turns out to be an answer. Shaun Pollock and Nasser Hussain look vaguely nonplussed.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>11am</strong> So, while the rain continues to fall in north London and I continue to consider the question \"if no one is reading your OBO report, does it actually exist?\", it may be time to assess what all this 3-0 nonsense really means for Team KP. As Vic Marks points out, there are obvious caveats: the honeymoon factor and the demob-happiness of the South Africans ever since they won the Edgbaston Test. Equally, second place in the world rankings - should they win 5-0 - is grotesquely misleading. Having said that, I can't remember a more exciting England one-day side since 1992. They have four fast bowlers (even if, as Steve Harmison has suggested, the one-day speedometer tends to flatter), a very deep batting line-up (Stuart Broad at No9, for goodness' sake), and a fit-again Andrew Flintoff. They also have only one near-donkey in the field (Harmison, and even he has a good arm). And then they have Mr Happy himself, KP. And yet. I'll be reserving judgment until they have finished their seven-match series in India later this year. If they learn to work the ball around on sluggish pitches, <em>then</em> I will tip my baseball cap unreservedly. But for the time being, it's raining.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>An email!</strong> \"Hasn't Rob Key lost a fair amount of weight since he last turned out for England?\" asks Josh Robinson. Yes. But Keysy could look like Kate Moss and we'd still accuse him of carrying too much weight. It's one of Cricket's Unspoken Laws.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>And another!</strong> \"It's really bucketing down here, dark skies, thunder, flash flood at the end of the road,\" says Paul Bourdin. \"But then again this is Manila. [Don't call us etc]. What are the odds that SA take heart from yesterdays performance by the Boks, and come back to stuff the English?\" Slim to none, Paul. And slim's just left town.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Random stat</strong> The last time England won four successive one-day matches against decent opposition was during that bizarre sequence in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy in early 2007. But that time before <em>that</em> was during the oft-forgotten Akai-Singer \"Champions\" Trophy [my inverted commas] in December 1997, when Adam Hollioake was captain and there were whispers of match-fixing. So a break in the clouds would be very welcome. \"Am I really the only person reading your OBO?\" asks Tom Bradshaw. \"Or are you waiting for the first email of the day? And if you are using that criterion and I am indeed the first one in your inbox today, have I just caused your report to exist? Power and fame at last...\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11.30am</strong> Right, according to the Met Office's addictive <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/radar/index.html\">rainfall radar</a>, there's still some pretty filthy weather in the Channel and it's making its way up north towards Lord's. How inconvenient. However, the radar also suggests that there may be clear skies behind the filth. Possibly. And while there's hope, we will be here to bring it to you.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>An email to pass the time</strong> \"The recent turn of fortunes does make me wonder what Moores has been doing all these months,\" writes Julian Bamford. \"If KP has managed to bring the obvious basics to the team, ie attitude, aggression, commitment etc inside three games, what has Moores been doing? Not much I say. Also: Christ I am bored going through about two dozen classical cds looking for music for my impending wedding.\" Ah, many congratulations and all that. When and where is the big day?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>More from Josh Robinson</strong> \"I'm wondering what, if anything, the ODI performances tell us about the potential make-up of the next Test XI. Flintoff seems to be making a convincing case that he can bat high enough up the order to justify a five-man attack without unbalancing the team, and Prior's glovework at least as much as his batting seems to make him a shoo-in for the next five-dayer. The batting line-up seems to decide itself, assuming Strauss is picked as an opening partner for Cook. But I'm not so sure about the bowling. It would be nice to have someone who could bat as well as Broad (or even Patel) at 8, But I don't know whether their bowling can be as effective in Tests as it has been this ODI series. I don't know if an attack of<br>Harmison, Anderson, Jones, Flintoff and Panesar would weaken the batting<br>line-up too much. And is it still too early for Rashid?\"</p> <p>I think it is too early for Rashid. He's still only 20 - let's allow him to develop his game in county cricket. You can forget Jones for the time being: he keeps breaking down. Anderson's batting has come on and so has Harmison's. That means a 9, 10, 11 of those two plus Monty is sustainable, especially with Broad at No8. I'd still have Flintoff at 7, because Prior - who will surely return to the Test side now - is good enough to bat at 6. I still wake up in a cold sweat from time to time pining about Marcus Trescothick, because the only potential weakness is Andrew Strauss. But this isn't a bad XI for any conditions: Strauss, Cook, Bell, Pietersen, Collingwood, Prior, Flintoff, Broad, Harmison, Anderson, Panesar.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>\"Since it's raining,\"</strong> writes Caroline O'Hagan, \"perhaps you can update us on OBO on the <a href=\"http://www.bizclass.co.uk/LaurieEngel/index.html\">Laurie Engel</a> run/walk? Last message I had was that [my hubby] Richard was over Wandsworth Bridge at about 11am (not bad walking considering his injured toe). The others must be at Lord's by now, surely?\" Does anyone know the answer?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11.55am</strong> It's still raining at Lord's but we live in hope, blind or otherwise. Here's Jeremy Theobald, who is currently sheltering under the Compton Stand but is still dedicated/sad enough to get in touch. \"While at The Oval on Friday with your colleague Jonathan Wilson, we wondered if there has <br>ever been an England team or even an international team that has had 10 players who have turned their arm over for their country in one side. Apart from Matt Prior, this one day side could bowl down to one and bat up to nine. Sri Lanka perhaps from a few years ago?\" Any takers?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 noon</strong> Well, it's stopped raining and the groundstaff are doing their stuff. Apparently the umpires will be out in 10 minutes' time to have a look, although it's still greyer than a pair of John Major's underpants out there.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Good news!</strong> Play will start at 1.15pm and the game will be 39 overs a side, with a 20-minute break between innings. The minimum number of overs required to constitute a match is 20 overs. But, still: hooray, eh?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Oh</strong>, and I'll be back on duty at 1pm. So save your bons mots - and your bad ones - until then.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Hello again.</strong> The news is that Kevin Pietersen has won the toss - you never thought he was going to lose it, did you? - and has stuck South Africa in under very grey skies indeed. Seems like the right decision to me. And England have named an unchanged side from the one which went 3-0 up at The Oval. Here's Caroline O'Hagan, who interestingly refers to her own husband by his surname. \"Naylor &amp; O'Hagan made it to Lord's,\" she says of the Laurie Engel Fund run. \"The runners have already been there and making their way towards the finish at Farringdon...\" Does this mean an impromptu visit to GU Towers?</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>South Africa</strong>, meanwhile, have made two changes - Vernon Philander for Albie Morkel, and Andre Nel for Makhaya Ntini - and line up like this: 1 HH Gibbs, 2 HM Amla, 3 JH Kallis (capt), 4 AB de Villiers, 5 JP Duminy, 6 MV Boucher (wk), 7 VD Philander, 8 J Botha, 9 M Morkel, 10 DW Steyn, 11 A Nel.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>For the record</strong>, and we do like to be thorough, England look like this: 1 Ian Bell, 2 Matt Prior (wk), 3 Owais Shah, 4 Kevin Pietersen (capt), 5 Andrew Flintoff, 6 Paul Collingwood, 7 Samit Patel, 8 Luke Wright, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 Steve Harmison, 11 James Anderson.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> The five-minute bell has just been rung at Lord's - but the drizzle is falling again. Yikes!</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> Ah, the covers are coming on again. You couldn't make this up. !@\u00a3$%^&amp;. \"To answer Jeremy Theobald,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst, \"on June 25 this year England fielded a one day side against the Kiwis in which every member of the side except Ambrose the keeper had an ODI wicket to his name. <a href=\"http://content-www.cricinfo.com/engvnz/engine/match/296907.html\">Here </a>it is.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> And now the covers are coming off again and it looks like we're going to start more or less on time. Expect more interruptions though. Here come Hashim Amla and Herschelle Gibbs to open the South Africa innings. Who'd be an opening batsman in these conditions?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 4-0 (Gibbs 3, Amla 1)</strong> Jimmy Anderson opens the bowling from the Nursery End and conditions could not be more ideal for seam bowling than if Glenn McGrath had ordered them himself. His fourth delivery beats a groping Gibbs, although a faint click - possibly bat on pad - persuades England to go up for caught behind. Umpire Benson is stoic. Gibbs then gets things going with a neat push to mid-off's right for three, then Hashim Amla keeps the strike with a work for a single behind square-leg. \"Without wanting to tempt fate,\" writes Josh Robinson, grabbing Kismet by the throat and kneeing him in the groin, \"is it unfair on Mark Boucher to suggest that the Saffers have a tail that starts four wickets down?\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 8-0 (Gibbs 3, Amla 5)</strong> England just have to do the basics here and the conditions should do the rest, but Stuart Broad's second ball is wide and Amla skews it off a thick outside edge through the vacant third-slip region and away for four. For those who care, the first powerplay lasts eight overs, the second four and the third three. It could make all the difference.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 12-0 (Gibbs 7, Amla 5)</strong> Anderson drops short and Gibbs has plenty of time to rock back and pull him high and handsome for four. Not a lot to report other than that, except to say that bringing in your own mug to Guardian Towers is definitely the way forward.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 21-0 (Gibbs 7, Amla 9)</strong> Broad <em>almost</em> gets Amla with a delivery that flies off the inside edge and is intercepted by Amla's pad rather than his stumps. Perhaps emboldened, Broad aims for the stumps once more - only to be worked through midwicket for four. Shot! And then the next ball swings down the leg-side and away for five wides. There was very little Matt Prior could have done about that and suddenly this is looking like a good start in unpromising conditions for the South Africans.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 36-0 (Gibbs 22, Amla 9)</strong> Anderson overpitches and Gibbs just touches him down the ground for four. The next ball offers a bit of width and Gibbs flays it through the cover for four more. England haven't woken up yet, and Goibbs flashes him through point for another boundary as if to make the point. A neat work through midwicket brings three and we are now officially into the territory marked \"flyer\". \"Oh dear you are going to get a visit are you?\" writes Ollie Ouzel of the impending arrival in Farringdon of Naylor and the hordes. \"And there is a distaff?\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 37-0 (Gibbs 23, Amla 9)</strong> The camera has just panned onto Brian Lara, who is chatting up a brunette lovely armed with a glass of wine in one of the hospitality areas. \"Having a good time,\" chuckles Shaun Pollock as Gibbs squirts Broad to third man for a single. A better over for England.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.41pm</strong> It's raining again and the umpires have gestured to the groundsmen to strut their stuff. That mini-session belonged emphatically to South Africa and just for once KP looks mildly irritated with life.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Perhaps this rain break has come at the right time for England. It gives Pietersen an early chance to regroup and remind his players that, heady though a 3-0 lead over the No2-ranked side in the world may be, a 3-2 scoreline won't look half as clever. This is England's chance to send South Africa home with mixed emotions; but defeat here and at Cardiff on Wednesday will put a different gloss on the tour altogether...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>1.48pm</strong> Ollie Ouzel seems to have been riled for some reason by the ubiquitous Gary Naylor/Mouth of the Mersey. \"Hope she's a good listener,\" he says, referring to Mrs Naylor. \"Look out for tommy thames, sammy severn and norman nile.\" I think Norman did a hamstring on the run, Ollie.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>Some badly spelled enthusiasm arrives from Tom van der Gucht as the drizzle falls at Lord's: \"The recent ressurgence as England as a competative team has been the highlight of my summer. Since 2005 I've sat with a growing sense of heartache and sorrow as the team seemed intent to bumble along seemingly without any real long term plans or even any self belief. I found myself listening to Coming around again by Carly Simon as I just couldn't bear to give up my support but knew i had more pain and dissapointment to endure. However they now really look like they are finally going somewhere and know what they are doing, subsequently I've been listening to more upbeat stuff like i wanna sex you up by color me badd!\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2pm</strong> No sign yet of a) the sun, and b) Naylor and the hordes. Perhaps Smyth has taken them all to the pub. That would be a first. Hmm. Anyone read any good books lately? I've just finished the excellent \"Bring Me The Head of Sergio Garcia\" by Tom Cox. If you like golf and you appreciate good writing, you'll love this. I promise.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>\"Hi, Lawrence,\" says Ian Copestake, as we await the mythical restart at Lord's. \"Both yourself and Paul Doyle seems to be suffering sport/weather induced ennui at the moment. If you are not getting any emails to cheer you up either could you at least wave to each other?\" I've just waved to him, Ian, but he ignored me.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> OK, there's a whisper that the game will resume at 2.30pm. The talk on the street is that it will be a 33-over-a-side game.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>An email that you may or may not prefer to ignore completely</strong>. \"I've just informed Paul Doyle that you have been waving to him, but he ignored me as well,\" says Ian Copestake, who needs to get out more.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 41-0 (Gibbs 27, Amla 9)</strong> So, here we go again. It's 33 overs a side, and Pietersen has brought on Steve Harmison in place of Jimmy Anderson (3-0-23-0) as England search for the wicket the conditions surely demand. His second ball is wide and Gibbs has a flash, but misses. Some bloke called Keith Flett has written in to say Amla has won a beard of the year award. For which many congratulations. Back in the real world, five dot balls are followed by a wide one from Harmison which Gibbs carts over cover for four. That ruined a decent first over.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 50-0 (Gibbs 27, Amla 18)</strong> Broad continues but his first ball is short and wide - there's a theme developing here - and Amla creams him through the covers for four. There are no slips in now, but Broad takes them out of the equation anyway by serving up a disgusting leg-stump delivery that Amla helps to fine leg for four of the easiest runs you'll ever see at international level. You wouldn't be able to guess which side were 3-0 up here. Or perhaps you would... \"Here is some filler material for you,\" writes the very considerate Marie Meyer in Sante Fe. \"I love the NatWest pink-pig snippets that appear when Sky cuts away and comes back to the coverage. The advertising firm should be very pleased with their work. If I lived in the UK, and if I had any money, I would definitely put it in a NatWest account. I think my favorite is the posh pig drinking tea from a cup vs the common pig slurping his from a trough.\" You don't work for them, do you, Marie?</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 66-0 (Gibbs 27, Amla 34)</strong> Er, that'll be more width from an England bowler then. Harmison's the culprit this time and Amla carves him over the solitary slip for four, before easing the next ball past cover for four more. Glorious stuff this, and Harmison makes a facial gesture which translates as \"yep, good shot - too good for me\". And then he does it again: another great shot, another cheek-blowing facial gesture. England are bowling tripe here: far too wide, far too 3-0. Harmison shows how much he has learned from the over by sending down another wide delivery: four more through extra cover. Drivel from England and 16 off the over. \"No, I don't work for the pigs,\" says Marie Meyer. \"I just think they are cute.\" Honk/Oink!</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Amla run out (Shah) 34 (66-1)</strong> What a gimme! Flintoff enters the attack, Gibbs pushes his first delivery down the ground and sets off for a single. Amla is slow to respond, Owais Shah gathers the ball at shortish mid-off and throws down the stumps at the striker's end with Amla not even in the picture. England hardly deserved that - but they desperately needed it.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 66-1 (Gibbs 27, Kallis 0)</strong> Here comes Jacques Kallis, who has played a strangely walk-on part this summer. Is his eye going? Quite possibly. Anyway, at least England know the run-rate won't get out of control while he's on strike, and - sure enough - he calmly leaves alone his first four deliveries, and then fiddles at misses at the last one from Flintoff, who begins with a maiden.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 73-1 (Gibbs 33, Kallis 1)</strong> It's a different game at the other end, where Gibbs creams Harmison's first ball through the covers for four: five of Harmison's last seven deliveries have now yielded off-side boundaries. The batsmen exchange singles and - despite that needless run-out - South Africa will be happy with this start. \"going for 'hitters' v 'proper batsman' in deciding your odi top order completely misses the point,\" says shariq gilani, who doesn't appear to like capital letters. \"the key element is whether you can consistently find gaps for boundaries. especially in overs 10-20 when the slips come out and its not easy to work the ball around for singles. one way of doing this is by hitting over the top ala jayasuriya. however you really to be a special talent to able to do this successfully. it isn't a coincidence that the most successful odi partnership was tendulkar and ganguly, neither of whom are traditional pinch hitters. ian bell can be understood by seeing that even in test matches he usually starts of strong against more attacking fields before slowing down. the last odi was another great example of this.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Kallis c Prior b Flintoff 1 (75-2)</strong> Kallis appears to get a thin nick on a loose drive at a wide one from Flintoff and Prior goes up for the catch. The umpires refer the decision, presumably because they're unsure whether the ball carried, but it's rightly upheld. Kallis shakes his head - he thinks he didn't hit it, although replays suggested a noise. Hmm. Whatever - England are back in this and Kallis has failed yet again. \"As we're on adverts, can I commend which ever company came up with the latest Huggies nappy advert?\" says Andy Bradshaw. \"As a new dad myself I can fully relate to it. Although they do appear to have cut the projectile pooh out.\" Which is always nice.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 78-2 (Gibbs 34, De Villiers 0)</strong> Snicko says Kallis edged it and I'm inclined to agree, even if the Sky commentators aren't. But the third umpire was asked to rule only on whether the ball had carried. Nasser says that from October 1, the third umpire can pass on extra information to his on-field colleagues, such as whether the batsman actually hit it. Anyway, he's out. And that was a cracking over from Flintoff.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 86-2 (Gibbs 42, De Villiers 0)</strong> Harmison has bowled poorly today. That's one short and Gibbs pulls for two, at which point Pietersen asks for a ball change and is duly obliged. Hussain and Atherton are still debating whether Kallis hit the ball, despite the fact that the stump mic clearly registers a noise that could have been nothing other than bat on ball (unless you subscribe to the theory that sometimes the bat handle clicks out of place when you free your arms). The change of ball has not changed Harmison's approach: there's another short one, and Gibbs stands-and-delivers him over midwicket for a one-bounce four. The shot of the day, but not the ball. Harmison's four overs have now cost 35.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 88-2 (Gibbs 43, De Villiers 0)</strong> As ever, the South African batsmen are treating Flintoff with so much respect it might be Nelson Mandela bowling to them out there. A peach cuts AB de Villiers in half, if such a thing is possible, and the sun is poking out, which seems even less plausible on this saturnine London day. \"Considering the controversy this summer with replays for low catches, is it advisable for Matt Prior to wear gloves that seem to perfectly match the colour of grass on their inside?\" asks Jonathan Stringer. \"Considering that Taufel just referred a catch that clearly carried (whether it was nicked is another matter), I think he might consider changing them.\" Erudite.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 92-2 (Gibbs 44, De Villiers 3)</strong> Enter the Oval hero, Samit Patel, who is on for the frankly disappointing Harmison (come on: he was never going to bowl economically <em>all</em> the time). This isn't a bad move by Pietersen: Patel got rid of Gibbs in his first over at Headingley and confidence levels will have been topped up by his five-for two days ago. Gibbs pushes his second ball to deep cover for a single, and De Villiers finally gets off the mark, 11th ball, with an involuntary outside edge to third man for three. Patel makes the sort of noise you might hear from a man who has just sat on a comedy upright drawing pin.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 96-2 (Gibbs 45, De Villiers 6)</strong> De Villiers looks clueless against Flintoff, who goes up for an optimistic shout for leg-before as the ball cuts back in: optimistic because it was clearly going over the top. Naturally, my withering assessment of De Villiers brings three runs through midwicket as Flintoff, for once, strays onto leg-stump. Gibbs nicks a quick single into the off-side, but De Villiers can only defend the last two deliveries of another very good Flintoff over. \"At the same time,\" writes Marie Meyer, \"perhaps South Africa should consider not dressing in grass green uniforms, on the simple grounds that they are ugly.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 99-2 (Gibbs 47, De Villiers 7)</strong> I wonder if Gibbs is getting frustrated here. He's pushing singles every ball, but then De Villiers takes three or four balls to return the strike. So it proves in that Patel over, which yields three singles. Richard O'Hagan writes in with details of today's Laurie Engel Fund run: \"All safely at Farringdon, save one who was last seen running into Baker St station.\"</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 103-2 (Gibbs 49, De Villiers 9)</strong> Paul Collingwood replaces Flintoff (an outstanding 4-1-8-1) ad is dabbed to third man for a single by Gibbs to bring up South Africa's hundred. The camera pans on to Marcus Trescothick, who is at Lord's to publicise his autobiography and takes a gentle sip of red wine. Must be weird for him to be here as De Villiers bottom-hands a meaty single to deep midwicket. A lot depends on Gibbs here. If he can cut free, South Africa can win this game. If he doesn't, there's a long tail to come.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 108-2 (Gibbs 50, De Villiers 13)</strong> De Villiers times Patel square on the off-side for two, but Patel keeps him guessing with a bit of flight. I wonder if Monty Panesar is watching. Gibbs drops the ball neatly into an off-side gap for a single that brings up a 46-ball half-century (he can do finesse as well as fireworks), but five off the over won't worry England unduly.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 113-2 (Gibbs 52, De Villiers 14)</strong> Collingwood thinks De Villiers is lbw, but umpire Taufel doesn't see it that way and he's right not to - that was high and possibly missing off-stump: the result is two leg-byes to fine third man. Harmison then misfields in the same region, allowing Gibbs to come back for a second - a rare moment of outfield scruffiness from England in this series. \"Since the quicks proper are being expensive today, why not have Belly on for a bit?\" says Thomas Lawrence. \"Or have we all forgotten he can bowl? He took 3 for 9 once. Against Zimbabwe, but still.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>WICKET! De Villiers c Flintoff b Patel 14 (113-3)</strong> An unconvincing innings comes to an even less assured end as De Villiers slog-sweeps Patel straight to deep midwicket, where Flintoff reveals a pair of giant buckets and claims the catch.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 114-3 (Gibbs 53, Duminy 0)</strong> The pressure mounts on Gibbs with that wicket. He has to be there until pretty near the end of the 33 overs, if not the end itself. One off Patel's over. Good stuff this from England after a very loose start with the ball.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 115-3 (Gibbs 54, Duminy 0)</strong> Collingwood keeps Gibbs quiet with his endearing brand of earnest medium-pace: Gibbs can't escape the Chinese water torture until the fifth ball of the over - and then the left-handed Duminy is beaten outside off. One from the over. \"Has anyone else caught this channel (Sky 456)?\" asks Dr Simon Ward. \"Badly-lit men talking about football over no footage of anything whatsoever; best thing is the American in the 'live zone' quoting odds and betraying no command of football jargon...\" Sounds like the OBO.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 118-3 (Gibbs 56, Duminy 1)</strong> Gibbs has gone into his shell here. Perhaps he's wary of the fact that next man in is Mark Boucher, who is a gutsy character but perhaps a place too high at No6. Patel is bowling really well, rushing through some tight overs of left-arm spin as the batsmen try - and mainly fail - to find the gaps. Just three singles off that over.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 125-3 (Gibbs 62, Duminy 2)</strong> Gibbs finally breaks the shackles with a mow over short fine leg for four off Collingwood, a shot - says Shaun Pollock - he learned from Desmond Haynes during their time together at Western Province. This is a better over for South Africa, who were getting stuck in a small rut: seven off it, and there are nine overs to go.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 130-3 (Gibbs 66, Duminy 3)</strong> Time to hit out, surely? But Patel is keeping things relatively quiet with his left-arm dinks. How does Gibbs play this? His team needs him to make a hundred, but the overs are running out. Five off that one.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 141-3 (Gibbs 72, Duminy 8)</strong> Clever from Gibbs, who paddles Collingwood to fine-leg for four. That may signal the start of the onslaught, and sure enough Duminy pulls him for four, if a touch unconvincingly. Still, 11 off the over, so mustn't grumble. \"The best thing about channel 456 is that the Guardian's very own Eastern European Football expert, author and all round sporting guru Jonathan Wilson turns up on it every now and then to add a bit of class and then gets emailed by Gary Naylor,\" says Andy Bradshaw. \"Not only is it badly lit, the studio is also a mile and a half wide.\" Why doesn't that surprise me? The bit about Naylor, I mean. Is there nothing the man doesn't pass comment on?</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 154-3 (Gibbs 73, Duminy 20)</strong> Lovely shot from Duminy, who advances on Patel and launches him straight back over his head for the first six of the day. Two balls later Duminy reverse-slaps him for four over what was previously short third man: four. A scrambled two off the last ball makes it 13 off the over. South Africa are moving through the gears like a boy racer in Hamilton, New Zealand, after closing time.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Duminy c Bell b Flintoff 20 (155-4)</strong> How reliable is Andrew Flintoff? With the second ball of a new spell, he persuades Duminy to flap an attempted pull straight up in the air and Ian Bell is waiting at midwicket.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 157-4 (Gibbs 74, Boucher 1)</strong> Replays show that Bell almost made a mess of that one: he went for the catch English-style (ie, back of the hand facing down) and the ball very nearly snuck through. That would have been more embarrassing than the time I failed to land a hand on that skyer against Fitzwilliam 2nds. Three runs and a wicket of another superlative Flintoff over.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Gibbs b Broad 74 (158-5)</strong> Broad strikes with the second ball of <em>his</em> new spell as Gibbs shuffles to off and tries to flick him to leg. Instead the ball ends up dribbling off his pads onto the stumps and so ends a super knock from only 75 balls. That's terrible timing for South Africa, who now have two new batsmen in at the death.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 161-5 (Boucher 2, Philander 1)</strong> At this stage you'd fancy England. A flurry from the South African tail could change that, but then Flintoff still has two overs to come. Just four off Broad's over, plus a wicket. Pietersen must be spreading the love.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 167-5 (Boucher 3, Philander 4)</strong> It looks extremely murky over in the south-west, and Nasser claims that's where the weather's coming from. \"A few Joel Garners over there,\" chuckles Michael Holding. \"Pardon?\" says Nasser. Big and dark, explains Holding. The Garners could ruin things yet, but for the time being we have Flintoff, who may just be the best death bowler in the world - just six off the over when South Africa really needed at least 10.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 175-5 (Boucher 9, Philander 6)</strong> It's been another what-might-have-been innings from South Africa. A confident side would have built on Gibbs's excellence, but there's a softness about their underbelly as the rain begins to fall over a <em>very</em> gloomy Lord's. Good stuff from Broad, mind you, who has taken a leaf out of Flintoff's bible and is striving for yorkers. Boucher then ruins things slightly with a cover-driven four as Broad sends down a wide one. Two overs to go. \"Don't want to rain on your parade,\" says Jack Lee. \"But I live in Ealing (i.e. a few miles west of Lord's) and I've just heard several rumbles of thunder...\"</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Philander c Anderson b Flintoff 10 (179-6)</strong> The ball after pulling Flintoff for four, Philander skies to long-off where Anderson gives Flintoff his third wicket of the innings. Ten balls to come.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 183-6 (Boucher 10, Botha 2)</strong> It really is amazing how Flintoff can bowl the yorker at will. Boucher manages just a quick single off the next two balls, but that's a nice shot from Johan Botha, who gives himself room and collects two to wide long-off. It's raining quite heavily now as Flintoff finishes with figures of 7-1-23-3 - outstanding in the circumstances.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>32.1 overs: South Africa 183-6</strong> Rain has forced the players off and that will be the end of the innings. Should play resume, Duckworth/Lewis will come into play. Stick with us, both of you, and we'll keep you posted.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.30pm</strong> Judging by the backdrop to the commentary-box chat between Gower, Atherton and Botham, Lord's currently resembles Hades on one of its gloomier days. Groan.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.37pm</strong> \"It's now tipping it down in Ealing,\" says Jack Lee. \"Tthe rain, and also the drool from the baby on my lap. I'd say we'll be lucky to get a result today.\"</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>A few numbers</strong> If play starts before 5.40pm, we have a game on our hands, although England would only face a 20-over runchase. Between now and then, the number of overs they will need to bat decreases steadily with every five minutes or so. And there are signs that Lord's may be brightening up. Or at least de-glooming.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>5pm</strong> The covers are coming off at Lord's. We may get a game yet. \"Would there be any sense of ironic justice if England batted 19 overs, and with Colly needing just 2 runs for his 50 and victory the game was called off for weather?\" wonders Robin Hazlehurst. \"I'm sure it would make the odd Kiwi happy as well as the odd Saffer.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>5.15pm</strong> The umpires are wandering around the outfield rather forlornly, knowing that the cricket has to restart before 5.38pm to avoid the game being called off. We will, as ever, be the first to let you know what other websites and Sky TV are saying.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>5.20pm</strong> Right, so we're hearing that the game will restart at 5.38pm and England will have 20 overs to score 137 to win. That's assuming it doesn't rain again...</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>5.35pm</strong> Here come the players. England need 137 off 20 to win and the weather is just about holding off.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 3-0 (Bell 3, Prior 0) need 137 off 20</strong> Just as worrying as the potential rain is the light: it's very gloomy in London right now. Still, we have some cricket to report and that's good enough for me as Dale Steyn begins with a widish delivery outside Ian Bell's off-stump which Mark Benson briefly considers signalling but thinks better off it. England really should win this: a total of 137 in a Twenty20 match wouldn't be regarded as too taxing, and Bell gets things going with a neat push through point for two off the third ball of the innings, then keeps the strike with a push for one to mid-on. Three runs off a sharpish first over.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p>\u00e7 If England win this series 5-0, they go second in the one-day rankings. I was trying to work out earlier precisely why I found this so counter-intuitive, and the penny has just dropped. It's because that would take them ahead of New Zealand, who have twice beaten them 3-1 this year. Rankings, eh? Pah. Meanwhile, as I wring my hands, Bell misses an attempted pull off Andre Nel before stealing an edgy single into the leg-side. Matt Prior has a look at his first ball, letting it pass outside off, and then sways out of the way of his second. A good start, this, by South Africa's bowlers.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Prior c Boucher b Steyn 0 (7-1)</strong> Prior steps away, throws everything at Steyn and nicks through to Boucher. First blood to the South Africans.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 9-1 (Bell 7, Shah 1) need 137 off 20</strong> These first three overs have swung the game back towards South Africa, although it's not a situation that two big overs for England won't remedy. If you see what I mean amid the negatives. Owais Shah is almost run out by Vernon Philander's direct hit from mid-off off the last ball of the over, but he's <em>just</em> in.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 14-1 (Bell 9, Shah 2) need 137 off 20</strong> Barely a shot in anger yet from England - at least not a successful one (Prior's dismissal was fairly furious). Shah pushes Nel towards mid-off for a single, and then Bell misses with a shimmy down the track. But he does connect with an off-side steer which collects two to wide third man. England need a further 123 off 16, which suddenly looks less comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Bell c Boucher b Morkel 13 (19-2)</strong> The ball after carting Morkel over gully for four, Bell steps away again but this time gets a very thick outside edge through to Boucher. Not very clever. \"Why are England starting with Ian Bell?\" wonders Tim Colyer, admittedly moments before Bell got out. \"If this is a 20-over run chase, shouldn't KP change the order and start with a biffer like Wright (as they would in a T20)? It always seems odd to me that the batting order is seemingly never changed no matter what the state of the match...\" Well, he did make a 36-ball 50 at The Oval, Tim...</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 19-2 (Shah 3, King Midas 0) need 137 off 20</strong> All hail KP! Wouldn't it just be typical if the man with you-know-what-colour touch ushered England home today? England can afford to knock the ball around for a bit, but not for too long. And the ball is nipping around now.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 21-2 (Shah 4, King Midas 1) need 137 off 20</strong> Vernon Philander joins the attack and England may decide he's the man who needs to go: the other three bowlers used so far have escaped punishment. Shah leans back to dab his first ball to third man for a single, before Pietersen misses an attempted work through midwicket. These may not be the conditions to play this shot. The next ball brings a swing, a miss and more movement off the seam, and Pietersen then plays and misses at the third ball in succession. I can see this going horribly wrong for England. Pietersen <em>does</em> connect with the fifth ball of the over, but it rushes straight to extra cover: no run. A quick single prevents five dots on the trot.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 25-2 (Shah 4, King Midas 3) need 137 off 20</strong> So, England have managed just one boundary in their first six overs, which is testimony to some very good bowling from South Africa and some juicy conditions for seam bowling. Pietersen tucks Morkel off his pads for a single, and the next ball, miles down the leg-side, results in two wides. Pietersen steals a very single to mid-on, but these are drips rather than the torrent England will need at some stage and Morkel is looking sharp. England need another 112 from 13 overs. Hmm.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 36-2 (Shah 12, King Midas 3) need 137 off 20</strong> At last, a bit of intent from England as Shah steps back to leg and kitchen-sinks Philander straight down the ground with a horizontal bat for four. That prompts Boucher to come up to the stumps, and he duly concedes a bye first ball as Shah plays and misses and the ball ricochets off Boucher's groping right glove. The next ball brings a bye too as Pietersen misses - is this ploy working for South Africa? The early evidence suggests not, and then Shah helps Philander over short fine leg for a much-needed boundary. England require 101 off 12.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 47-2 (Shah 13, King Midas 11) need 137 off 20</strong> Pietersen throws the bat at a wide one from Morkel and collects four speculative runs to fine third man before working the next ball to midwicket for two. Morkel then sends down an off-side wide that really should be punishable by flogging, and repeats the dose two balls later. He can be frightening, Morkel - but to his own captain as well as the opposition. England have scored 22 in the last two overs, which is a bit more like it. \"Unfortunately the met office rainfall radar and satelite pictures show that the game will get a finish,\" says Ian Rogers. \"It is indeed '3-0, job-done' stuff from England, as has been SA's performance in the last three games after the Test series. This one is gone! 137 in 20 should be gettable if the attitude is right but the boys have started like they have no game plan. First cracks in the \"golden\" new era perhaps??????\" !!!!!!!!!!!!</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 53-2 (Shah 14, King Midas 17) need 137 off 20</strong> Pietersen is denied a probable boundary by his own team-mate as Shah gets in the way of a thumping straight-drive off Philander. Ouch, but no matter: Pietersen takes out his irritation on the next ball instead, carting it dismissively over midwicket for four. Shot! Right, we've reached the halfway stage and England need a further 84 from 10. Fifty-fifty I reckon.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 73-2 (Shah 21, King Midas 30) need 137 off 20</strong> Kallis comes on and Shah pinches a cheeky single after failing to connect properly. And now Pietersen is finding his groove, pulling the next ball, which wasn't all that short for four, then cracking the one after that through extra cover for four more. The next ball is a slower one, but Pietersen is seeing it like a melon now and heaves it over midwicket for a third successive boundary. The fifth ball of the over brings a leg-side single as Pietersen starts walking around his crease and then Shah completes a huge over for England by pulling Kallis for six! Twenty runs off it and England are now favourites.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 77-2 (Shah 23, King Midas 32) need 137 off 20</strong> Here's Johan Botha, who Michael Holding can reveal has never taken a wicket in the second innings of a one-day international. What a bizarre stat, which can end only one way. A sensible over from England, who content themselves with four singles and now need 60 off eight. \"Dammit!!\" exclaims Ian Rogers. \"My first-ever email on OBO (I admit you could count the number of times I've tried on two hands, but Naylor I am not) and it has to be the negative one. Things are looking up since my last mail but still a massive ask isn't it?\"</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 86-2 (Shah 30, King Midas 34) need 137 off 20</strong> Back comes the wiry and vaguely creepy-looking Steyn, and Shah welcomes him with a swat to wide long-on for four. These two are playing very nicely now. The bad balls are going to the rope, the good one are being worked for singles. Nine off the over leaves an equation of [fumbles with abacus] 51 off seven. \"Wouldn't 'seeing it like a melon' be more appropriate for someone who was batting with a needle-thin twig that had a tendency to crash into a<br>heavy piece of fruit sending it approximately nowhere?\" asks Josh Robinson, with nit-picking precision.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Pietersen c Amla b Botha 40 (93-3)</strong> Pietersen perishes trying to hit his second six of the over. But this time the slog-sweep comes up short and Amla takes a simple catch at deep midwicket to help Botha break his second-innings duck. Still, 40 off 34 balls wasn't a bad effort from KP. \"Ay op, Lawrence, and greetings from somewhere on the East Coast Main Line,\" writes Mat Wrigley, \"where the free WiFi is allowing me to vicariously enjoy (if that's the right word) the proceedings from Lord's. Hoorah for OBO, meanwhile, because for some reason BBC iPlayer thinks I am in Sweden and so cannot get the streaming commentary!\" The free WiFi on that line is one of British public-transport's greatest gifts.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 94-3 (Shah 31, Flintoff 1) need 137 off 20</strong> Erm, I think Flintoff was dropped first ball there off Botha by Boucher as he went to late-cut. But no one seems to have noticed. Forty-three needed off six.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 106-3 (Shah 34, Flintoff 10) need 137 off 20</strong> Morkel returns but Flintoff just opens the face and beats Nel's stuck-in-mud run from third man to the backward-point fence: four runs. Shah brings up the hundred with a clever push wide of mid-on and this game is England's now for the taking. So long as the light doesn't close in. Shah is playing this really well, manoeuvring the ball into the gaps and holding the pose as he takes a single. And there's four to Flintoff through the covers. Shot! England need 31 off five overs. \"I'm starting to feel quite sad now!!\" weeps Ian Rogers. \"Surely this is just me and you? Two out of two today that you've published!!!! Bah, you're getting paid for it and I'm not!!! My shame will only be placated by an England win, even if it completely destroys my credibility given my first email!\" I feel it's too late for that, Ian.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 119-3 (Shah 40, Flintoff 17) need 137 off 20</strong> South Africa are trying to slow things down in the hope that the weather can save them, but Flintoff is wise to the plan and dismisses Botha over long-on for six. The crowd loves that one! And they're not exactly disconsolate at that slog-sweep for four from Shah. England should walk this now, weather permitting. \"Can you tell Mat Wrigley to try again,\" says Toby Rutland. \"I am in Sweden and can get the commentary loud and clear.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 132-3 (Shah 43, Flintoff 27) need 137 off 20</strong> South Africa are trying every trick in the book to slow this down as Philander sends down a few practice deliveries to waste some more time. England, needless to say, have form of their own: they got away with a no-result against New Zealand earlier in the year when the Kiwis needed to score seven or so off the last over before the weather closed in. So we can't get too high and mighty. Still, cheating South Africans eh? Joke. Shah seems to have things under control, mind you. He eases Philander to wide long-off for two, then gives the strike to Flintoff, who obliges by tonking a low full-toss over midwicket for four, then repeats the dose next ball. Appalling bowling. \"!!!\" says Joe Neate. I think I know what he means: England need five off three overs.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>England win by seven wickets</strong> with 14 balls to spare as Flintoff moves across his crease to deposit Nel over backward square-leg for four. Wow! England lead South Africa 4-0 and are just one win away from leapfrogging both them and New Zealand and moving to second in the world rankings. Flintoff finishes with 31 off 12 balls, but plaudits too to Shah, who has 44 off 40 and anchored the win. Thanks for all the emails, of which this is the last: \"Since KP will surely be named King by the end of next year I think Ian Rogers may be facing retrospective treason charges,\" says Ian Truman. \"I'd suggest he leaves the country on the next flight.\"</p>",

  "<p>In these days of near-continuous diagnosis, one hears the term \"autophile\" bandied about a fair bit. The OED, thankfully, has neglected to admit the word to its swelling ranks, but there was \u2013 and perhaps still is \u2013 an \"autophile\" column in the Argus of Brighton, and the Bluetones' third album was called \"Autophile\" after the opening track. The <a href=\"http://www.lyricstime.com/bluetones-autophilia-lyrics.html\">lyrics</a> (\"I love your slinky spoilers / They really speak to me\") inhabit a realm in which subtlety seldom trespasses.</p> <p>As a natural pedant, I am disposed to despair at such profound etymological abuse. But in the case of autophilia, which in theory at least refers to a passion directed not at the motor car but at oneself (sexualised narcissism, in short), things are different. For the car has parked itself so firmly in the multi-storey parking lot that is our sense of identity, that the conditions of loving oneself, and loving one's wheels, amount pretty much to the same thing. Cars, it seems, 'r' us.</p> <p>This commonly enough observed phenomenon is given an unusually thorough treatment in the shape of the publication this week of Traffic, a new book by <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2008/08/27/traffic/index.html\">Tom Vanderbilt</a> subtitled \"Why we drive the way we do (and what it says about us)\". The premise relates to the notion that because driving depersonalises the space around us \u2013 as the narrator of Paul Haggis's Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/\">Crash</a> has it, \"We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something\" \u2013 the study of our behaviour behind the wheel provides fruitful access to a modified social psychology that is in many ways in danger of becoming the norm. For Vanderbilt, in other words, the motorway is as telling a sociological library as you're likely to find.</p> <p>But Traffic, which is Vanderbilt's third book, is not the kind you'd find in the sociology section of your university library. For one thing, it's well written. For another, it's amusing; at times very much so. So it's not going to start any revolutions \u2013 on the tarmac or in the lecture theatre \u2013 but is more than likely to start some healthy chatter with its anecdotal style and uncommon degree of thoughtful insight into such things as early and late mergers, the 20mph limit on eye contact, why everyone but us is a terrible driver, and the surprising effect on road safety of Sweden's 1967 switch to right hand traffic. This latter history, in fact, is developed into one of the book's main strands, which is the observation that the more hazardous we perceive our driving environment to be, the safer we are to drive in it. The perception that we are driving in safety, in other words, is the greatest hazard of the road.</p> <p>One disappointment, though, is that Vanderbilt didn't raise his eyes above the tarmac horizon long enough to examine the well-established link between cars and freedom. A staple of the teenage imagination and its representation in film and fiction, we accord the passing of our driving test with the kind of rite-of-passage status our ancestors might have credited a young warrior's victory in battle. The keys to the car equate to the freedom not only to roam far beyond the nest \u2013 or to kill ourselves in the process of trying \u2013 but to look in the rear view mirror and know that we're not in the same place as before.</p> <p>I was free last weekend, so I hired a car and drove my wife and two friends to the North Yorkshire moors. Unaccountably, the hire firm gave me a Mercedes, a big one. Like most of us, my self-image wavers between sex-god genius and potbellied pub-bore, but with three attractive women on board, eyeing the approaching traffic through Mr Daimler's cleverly adapted cross-hairs (apparently the three segments represent the domination of land, sea and air), I felt every bit the big man: rich, powerful and with the acceleration and champagne paint-job to prove it. </p> <p>And then we hit the M1, where the average speed come bank holiday weekend hangs everyone off the same peg. But the longish stretch during which our average speed wavered between one and five mph at least gave me liberty to explore the further phallic reaches of the dashboard, leading eventually to the discovery of something called \"automatic cruise control\". For those not in the know, having indicated a desired speed, lasers on the front of the car get to work calculating your speed in relation to that of the car in front, and adjust it accordingly, completely ignoring your earlier, ridiculously optimistic command to drive at 80mph. Some models even read the white lines to the left and right, steer you safely down the middle. </p> <p>At first all this felt rather dangerous. Once accustomed, though, the details of my true predicament dawned on me. With the traffic pursuing its own progress, seemingly independently of the actions and judgements of the car drivers, I realised that I was sitting in the cramped, if luxuriously so, equivalent of a train compartment \u2013 one, moreover, whose virtual couplings were the only thing of which I was left in control. And even then, \"control\" is to be understood in the strictly limited sense in which I was free to break them, free in a sense to collide with either of the adjacent carriages.</p> <p>As the illusion of power over my own destiny flew out with the exhaust fumes, the sobering thought dawned on me that just as our concept of liberty atrophy in our over-administered society, one of the main metaphors for human freedom \u2013 the car - has kept apace with telling faith. One day, for sure, we will certainly look back with disbelief at the way individual drivers were free to steer and accelerate at will, at the possible expense of their own lives, not to mention those of others. In much the same way, just as we will most likely eventually discredit the backwards society of our fumbling ancestors who extended to parents the right to influence the destiny of the young proto-citizenry that sprang from their loins. </p> <p>Freedom, if the word still exists at such a time, may then equate to the residual degree of discretion when it comes to deciding whether to go off the rails or not, a reduced meaning it is already acquiring in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/01/highereducation.news1\">various reaches</a> of the academy. And the speed with which this metaphor is approaching literality in the sphere of our near gridlocked traffic systems augurs ill. </p> <p>In the meantime, there's always a good walk on the moors. But you know what they say, or at least said on American Werewolf in London: \"Stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors.\"</p>"
