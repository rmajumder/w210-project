  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/15/canada-election-conservative-government\">re-election of Stephen Harper's Conservative party</a> to a minority government this month means Canada is being served a lukewarm plate of more-of-the-same as they watch their southern neighbour potentially elect a politician who might significantly change the face of politics. But as the status quo prevails in Ottawa, the status of American soldiers who fled to Canada after the outbreak of the Iraq war hangs in the balance. Many have argued that the fate of these soldiers could redefine Canada's relationship with the US, but, after the November election, they could also redefine America's own post-Bush position on the Iraq war itself.</p> <p>There are currently an estimated 200 US soldiers residing in Canada, who left the army without official consent after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Canada's history of providing a safe haven for up to 50,000 young <a href=\"http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/clips/1928/\">Americans fleeing the draft during the Vietnam era</a>, along with its reputation for respecting human rights, has made it an obvious choice for deserting members of the US armed forces. All soldiers interviewed say their <a href=\"http://www.resisters.ca/resisters_stories.html\">reason for deserting the army</a> was the illegality of the Iraq war or the abuses perpetrated by their fellow soldiers.</p> <p>Although the Canadian parliament passed a non-binding motion in June in favour of allowing American deserters to stay, several have since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/16/antiwar.iraq\">lost their appeals against deportation</a>, and others await a similar fate, facing certain <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20080710.BCDEPORTATION10%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3DUS%2Bdeserters%2Bcorey&amp;ord=7467741&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true\">imprisonment if returned to the US</a>. Although this month's election didn't exactly give Harper a resounding mandate to rule, the re-election of the Conservatives means it is unlikely Canada will change it's tepid position to a Trudeau-era pledge to provide a \"refuge from militarism\" any time soon.</p> <p>The shift in attitude toward the American deserters from the Trudeau era to today is not confined to the ruling conservatives. While barely reported in the US media, the response in the Canadian press to these soldiers has been vocal but mixed. Even many who are vociferously opposed to George Bush insist that this is not Canada's problem to deal with. Jonathan Kay at Canada's conservative, Conrad Black-owned National Post has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7444116.stm\">argued</a> that \"America's fair-weather soldiers shouldn't be permitted to make a mockery of a Canadian refugee system that was originally designed to protect migrants fleeing assassination and torture\" and points out that, in contrast to the Vietnam era, the US no longer has the draft.</p> <p>Campaigners against the deportation of soldiers point out that conscription could almost describe the reality of modern American army recruitment, because the temptation of army scholarships to severely disadvantaged teenagers works as a kind of a <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20030405.UROYYN_4%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3Droy%2Bmacgregor%252C%2Bpoverty%252C%2Bmilitary%2Bservice&amp;ord=3208224&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true\">de-facto draft for poor people</a>. Other campaigners point out that soldiers deserting from wars \"condemned by the international community\", are eligible for asylum status under UN rules, and that the 2003 invasion of Iraq - conducted without a UN mandate and subject to worldwide condemnation - undoubtedly fits this criteria.</p> <p>Unfortunately, these arguments don't really hold up to scrutiny. As much as one can empathise with the sense of betrayal felt by deserting soldiers who never thought they'd be asked to fight in an illegal war, as much as we can sympathise with working-class American teenagers being hoodwinked into joining the army with promises of scholarships, the fact that the US no longer conscripts its soldiers is a stumbling block that can't be dismissed.</p> <p>There's the very real argument that utilising the concept of \"asylum seekers\" for political ends runs the risk of making a mockery of those fleeing grave human rights abuses in their home country. (The extent to which the conservatives using this argument at the National Post truly care about \"genuine\" asylum seekers is another issue). That Canada's response to Iraq-era US deserters is different from its response during the Vietnam war does tell us something about how Canada has veered to the right, as progressive Canadians point out. But it is also a product of America no longer having the draft, and this can't be ignored either.</p> <p>This seems to be the conundrum that the deserting soldiers present. It's obvious that no one would benefit from seeing these soldiers prosecuted back in America, and that their likely post-traumatic stress and sense of conscience in the face of the Iraq war hardly makes them dangerous criminals, and yet drawing upon the language of refugees and asylum-seekers - which is currently the best mechanism the soldiers have to defend themselves against deportation - isn't an appropriate use of human rights legislation. <br> So what is to be done? Well, there is one alternative: America could decline to prosecute the soldiers once they are deported from Canada. And while no one could expect this to happen in the dying days of George Bush's lame-duck presidency, there is a real opportunity for anti-deportation campaigners in Barack Obama, who, if elected, could promise the US soldiers in Canada that they are free to return home without fear of incarceration.  Jimmy Carter famously <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/vietnam/vietnam_1-21-77.html\">pardoned Vietnam draft-dodgers</a> just days after his inauguration, having controversially promised to do so during his campaign. Given the differences between the Vietnam draft and today's conscientious objectors, such an overt route wouldn't be appropriate for Obama. Instead, a quiet acknowledgement that the soldiers residing in Canada could return without fear of prosecution would draw a line under the last eight years of disastrous US foreign policy, while keeping the language of refugees and asylum-seekers out of the debate in Canada, preserving it for those who have suffered genuine human rights abuses. By acknowledging that the US deserters were following their consciences on the illegality of the Iraq invasion, the new US administration could show its commitment to moving beyond the Bush era, and begin to repair bridges with the rest of the world.</p>",

  "<p>Law enforcement officers have foiled a plot by two neo-Nazis who aimed to assassinate Barack Obama and kill 102 other black people, according to court records unsealed today.</p> <p>The disrupted plot involved robbing a gun store to obtain weapons that the two skinheads would use against Obama and black students in the state of Tennessee, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), a US law enforcement agency.</p> <p>ATF agents confiscated five guns from the two perpetrators, 20-year-old Daniel Cowart of Bells, Tennessee, and 18-year-old Paul Schlesselman of West Helena, Arkansas. Both are being held without bail by authorities.</p> <p>\"They said that would be their last, final act, that they would attempt to kill Senator Obama,\" Jim Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge of the ATF's Nashville office, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"They didn't believe they would be able to do it, but that they would get killed trying.\"</p> <p>Although the perpetrators were doubtful of their ability to carry out their grisly plans, the plot risks stoking the simmering cauldron of racial uncertainty that Obama has faced in rural areas of the US. </p> <p>Even as polls show his support among white voters reaching a record high for a Democratic candidate, workers for the Obama campaign have confronted the legacy of prejudice in the south and Appalachian areas.</p> <p>Obama campaign offices in several states have been defaced with racist graffiti, and door-to-door canvassers have shared reports of voters making prejudiced remarks about the candidate. </p> <p>Three men were detained two months ago during the Democratic convention in Denver after discussing a plot to kill Obama, but prosecutors did not deem that incident a credible threat.</p> <p>The two neo-Nazis chose 102 as the number of victims for their plot based on numerology that is significant to white supremacists. They are facing charges of unregistered firearm possession, conspiracy to steal firearms from a licensed gun dealer, and making threats to a candidate for president.</p>",
  "<p>Democratic leaders are raising their hopes of an election year sweep - winning the White House, and achieving solid majorities in both houses of Congress to dominate Washington on a scale unseen in 40 years.</p> <p>With Obama ahead in the polls, and Democrats set to expand their majority in the House of Representatives, party leaders are focused on consolidating their control of the Senate.</p> <p>Democratic as well as Republican leaders now believe it is possible Democrats will reach the magical number of 60 seats in the Senate.</p> <p>That would give the Democrats what is called a filibuster-proof majority, making it impossible for Republicans to cut off debate or limit legislation.</p> <p>If Barack Obama wins the White House, that would bring a consolidation of Democratic power in Washington unseen since the 1960s.</p> <p>\"This is a tectonic race,\" Charles Schumer, the New York senator who is overseeing the Democrats' Senate election campaign, told reporters last week. \"This will change things not just for an election cycle but a generation.\"</p> <p>A wave of anti-Republican sentiment, coupled with excitement over Obama's candidacy that has brought more Democrats to the polls in early voting, has seen Democrats predicting far bigger gains than expected even a few weeks ago.</p> <p>John McCain's faltering campaign for the White House has also hurt Republican candidates in battleground states.</p> <p>Both parties are now using the prospect of a filibuster-proof Senate in their campaigns.</p> <p>The Democrats are pushing for 60 as a goal that would allow Obama, if he's elected, to push through sweeping changes on energy, healthcare and foreign policy.</p> <p>The Republicans meanwhile are campaigning on the dangers of unchecked Democratic rule. Their television ads now routinely link Obama to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, warning of a dangerous liberal triumvirate.</p> <p>\"Liberals are bent on handing Barack Obama a filibuster-proof Senate majority to rubber-stamp his radical agenda,\" Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican warned in a fundraising email.</p> <p>Democrats won a 51-49 majority in the Senate after the 2006 elections. But that did not translate into effective power, under Senate rules that allow the minority party to extend debate and prevent legislation from being put to a vote.</p> <p>The Republicans launched nearly 100 filibusters in the last two years, reducing the Senate to a state of paralysis.</p> <p>Senate Democrats could not even manage to win enough votes to withdraw US forces from Iraq - even though several similar bills easily passed through the House. That could now change, Reid wrote in a recent email to supporters.</p> <p>\"Everything Democrats believe in and fight for is in reach,\" Reid wrote. \"We have a breathtaking opportunity to change America ... We stand at the very brink of electing Barack Obama president and giving him a filibuster-proof majority.\"</p> <p>But solid majorities in Congress are no guarantee that a president will actually win co-operation from his own party - as Jimmy Carter knows. The Democrats won 61 seats in the Senate when Carter was elected in 1976, but he rapidly fell out with his party.</p> <p>Obama, if elected, could also run into resistance from a number of the new crop of Democratic challengers, especially those competing in southern states. A number of the first-time Democratic contenders lean to the right, while some of the Republicans now fighting for their political survival are moderates.</p> <p>\"You are going to have some defections on the Democratic side because these are some conservative Democrats,\" said Rhodes Cook, who runs a respected political newsletter. \"Whoever is elected will be hemmed in by the economy a great deal so that might also be the point that overrides the size of the majority.\"</p> <p>Democrats are hoping to capture a number of important seats in the Senate, including in formerly bedrock Republican regions like the south and Rocky Mountain west.</p> <p>Out of the 35 seats up for election, Republicans are defending 23 and the Democrats just 12. Democrats are leading in all the races they are defending and party leaders say they are confident of winning all 12 seats.</p> <p>But Republicans face tough contests across the map, with Democrats even or ahead in about a dozen seats.</p> <p>By last week, Republican congressional candidates were near open revolt against McCain. John Ensign, the Nevada Republican who is heading the party's Senate election campaign, was describing McCain as a drag on his fellow candidates.</p> <p>\"Our candidates are running ahead of John McCain in almost every place that I mentioned across the country,\" he told a briefing at the National Press Club.</p> <p>The challenges to the Republicans cut across geography as well as ideology. Seats held by retiring senators in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado are now virtually assured of going Democratic.</p> <p>Party elders even in conservative states are facing a tough time. In North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole, who served in two Republican administrations and ran for the White House herself in 2000, is having to spend her own money to fend off a Democratic challenger.</p> <p>There are also tight contests in Mississippi and Georgia, where a high turnout of African-American voters for Obama in early voting appears to have breathed new life into Democratic Senate challenges once seen as longshots.</p> <p>The fate of Alaska senator Ted Stevens depends how the electorate views the guilty verdict in his trial on corruption charges. The jury found Stevens guilty on seven counts.</p>",

  "<p>In 2004, John Kerry ran a fairly straightforward secularist election campaign, in effect ceding the so-called \"values voters\" to George Bush. Bill Clinton, among others, had counseled Kerry to moderate this strategy. Clinton even suggested to Kerry that he loudly oppose gay marriage in toss-up states like socially conservative Ohio, but Kerry begged off, explaining that he didn't want to appear intolerant.</p> <p>After Kerry's defeat, Democrats <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/15/value.voters/index.html\">resolved not to commit</a> the same mistake again. They quickly formed committees and groups dedicated to casting Democratic party policies in a religious light. </p> <p>Barack Obama, in particular, embraced this strategy. He shrewdly sensed the possibilities of poaching some values voters from the Republican party by adopting a tone of religious uplift and giving a religious patina to his policies, particularly his anti-war one.</p> <p>Recent polls suggest that the strategy is paying off. <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=349\">According to the Pew Forum</a>, Obama has scooped up a majority of \"white non-hispanic Catholic\" registered voters, with 49% of them supporting or leaning toward him and 41% supporting or leaning toward John McCain. </p> <p>This is a notable feat, given that a rating for Obama's voting record on the moral issues most crucial to the Catholic Church \u2014 abortion, gay civil unions, etc \u2014 would surely rank near zero.</p> <p>Obama also enjoys increasing support from \"white mainline Protestant\" registered voters. He has shot ahead of McCain 48% to 43% among those voters.</p> <p>But something else is at work here, besides just Obama's effective outreach to religious voters. He is also benefiting from the leftward drift of religion in America in general. This is a long-unfolding trend that another survey \u2014 this one commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/index_flash.html\">Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.unfoundation.org/\">United Nations Foundation</a> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.greenbergresearch.com/index.php?ID=\" 2266\" \">points up</a>. </p> <p>Their survey found, for example, \"generational change\" among younger evangelical Christians who have adopted \"a <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004406277_evangvote11m.html\">more inclusive definition</a> of what it means to be 'pro-life' and are more supportive of efforts to combat global warming\".</p> <p>Another striking finding from the survey \u2014 one which lends itself to Obama's anti-war pitch to Christians \u2014 is: \"The religious landscape has shifted with evangelical Christians now expressing the greatest support for an interventionist role, while more moderate religious groups like mainline Protestants and Catholics take a more isolationist posture\".</p> <p>Obama is deftly exploiting America's new Christian left. In recent days, his Catholic surrogates, such as the law professor <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/convictions/archive/2008/03/23/endorsing-obama.aspx\">Doug Kmiec</a>, have, like those younger evangelical Christians mentioned in the survey, stretched the definition of the phrase \"pro-life\" to include many issues beyond abortion, thereby confusing some anti-abortion Catholics into supporting Obama.</p> <p>Kmiec has even taken to arguing that Obama is more \"pro-life\" than McCain, despite the fact that Obama received a 100% voting rating from the women's rights group <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/campaigns/268.htm\">Planned Parenthood</a>. Denver's Archbishop Charles Chaput has called Kmiec's novel reasoning a form of \"<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/sns-ap-rel-archbishop-obama,0,921435.story\">self-hypnosis</a>\".</p> <p>Obama can see that American secularism has secularised almost everything, including religion itself. Therefore, a play for less-doctrinaire, secularised Christians becomes possible. The party's old secularist positions can even be shoehorned into fading Christian concepts.</p> <p>The poll conducted for Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly and the United Nations Foundation sheds some light on this hybrid of secularism and religion increasingly popular in America: on the one hand, it found that despite \"increasing religious diversity, a majority agree with the notion that our nation is blessed and that it should set a Christian example to the world\". On the other hand, it found that there \"is less consensus around the ideologically charged areas of foreign policy, particularly women's rights and environmental policy. While most support efforts to improve maternal health, people are more divided on lifting the '<a href=\"http://www.globalgagrule.org/\">global gag rule</a>,' which would free up resources to organizations providing a full range of women's health services including abortion\".</p> <p>Obama grasped what John Kerry didn't: that beneath this growing confusion lay a considerable number of votes.</p>",
  "<p>More evidence, as if we needed it, that we need to make more of an effort to balance our work and personal lives.</p> <p>Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://tech.yahoo.com/news/nm/20081027/wr_nm/us_technology_ibrain_tech_net\">the brains of 'digital natives'</a> are developing to deal more efficiently with searching and filtering large amounts of information, and making quick decisions.

  "<p>John McCain, searching for an elusive comeback with only a week left to the election, today warned Americans to face the prospect of the most liberal administration in the country's history if the Democrats are allowed to control both the White House and Congress.</p> <p>Campaigning in Ohio, which he described as \"a must-win\" state, McCain searched for a message that might still turn the election even at this late stage. He emphatically distanced himself from President George Bush's economic -policies and prepared to dust down one of his main selling points, his record as an American war hero.</p> <p>McCain, after a meeting with his economic advisers in Cleveland, Ohio, described Obama as \"the most liberal person to ever run for the presidency\". He labelled Obama, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, the Democratic senate leader, as \"a dangerous threesome\". </p> <p>McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, took up the same theme, telling a rally in Leesburg, Virginia: \"If big government spenders control the House and the Senate and heaven forbid the White House, they will have a monopoly in Washington.\"</p> <p>The warnings are a tacit admission by McCain and Palin of their underdog status.</p> <p>In the final frenetic days of campaigning, McCain and Obama are tracking one another across the battleground states.Both were in Ohio today, and are scheduled to be in Pennsylvania Tuesday and Florida Wednesday.</p> <p>These states are turning into McCain's last stand. Having lost ground elsewhere according to the polls, he can not afford to lose any of these three. This was his 14th visit to Ohio since securing the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year.</p> <p>Turnout at McCain's rallies in these states have been poor compared with Obama and he is being outspent in Ohio in advertising by four to one. </p> <p>He is taking a beating, too, on the normally passionately Republican talk-radio shows. Bill Cunningham, who broadcasts from Cincinnati, Ohio, and whose broadcasts go out on 300 stations across America, spent his Sunday night show berating McCain for the way he had conducted the campaign, making it clear he thought the election was lost and urging the Republicans to begin planning to ensure Obama does not secure a second term.</p> <p>After today's economic meeting, McCain again attempted to cut himself free from Bush, whose unpopularity is a massive drag on his campaign. McCain, who at the last presidential debate earlier this month reminded Obama he was not Bush, said after the Cleveland meeting that both he and Obama \"disagree with President Bush on economic policy\". </p> <p>However, he added, they had a fundamental difference on how to resolve the economic crisis. Obama wanted to raise taxes while McCain wanted to lower expenditure.</p> <p>Republicans critical of how McCain has been fighting the election campaign accuse him of failing to stick to a -message for any length of time. He began the campaign last month by stressing he had been tested by crisis as both a Navy fighter pilot and a POW in Vietnam, but has since largely dropped these claims from his repertoire.</p> <p>However, he is planning to return to the theme at a rally tomorrow in Florida, where he will be surrounded by several retired members of the military.<br></p>",
  "<p>Where is parliament? When will MPs step up to defend the liberties that are seized from the British public every day in what has now become the most serious attack on constitutional rights that this country has ever suffered?</p> <p>Last week GCHQ and the Home Office were arguing that \u00a312bn of taxpayers' money should be spent to collect data from every internet connection, phone call and email made in this country. This week we learn that police will be issued with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/project-midas-fingerprint-scanner-liberty\">mobile fingerprint scanners</a> to allow offices to carry out identity checks on people in the street. </p> <p>Neither has been debated in parliament and it seems certain this latest measure \u2013 like the creation of the Police National DNA database and the new Automatic Number Plate Recognition system \u2013 never will be, even though it must be obvious that the deployment of this device on the streets profoundly affects the rights of citizens to go about their business without being forced to prove who they are and what they are doing.</p> <p>When ID card legislation was passed, the government assured us that police would not have the right to ask for people's cards on the street precisely because it altered the relationship between the authorities and the citizen. Surely demanding biometrics is going one stage further than asking for a card: it now seems certain that this will form some kind of precedent for doing so.</p> <p>The police argue that fingerprint data will not be kept. But how are we to know? And anyway that is not the point. In a free society, every individual has the right to move about without being asked to prove him or herself to the state. It is the <em>sine qua non</em> of a functioning democratic society yet we are letting this principle slip without a single voice being raised in parliament. I repeat: where the hell are our elected representatives? Why do they not defend us? </p> <p>Labour laws are powered by the assumption of people's guilt and their malign intentions towards society. This is the theme which runs right through the government's programme to convert Britain into a state of unwavering watchfulness, in which respect for citizens is replaced by suspicion. </p> <p>I and several other journalists have been saying this for a long time but it seems without any galvanising effect in the legislature. Lawyers and academics are equally concerned. Last week the outgoing DPP, Sir Ken MacDonald, eloquently voiced his profound worries. But with the exception of Conservative MP David Davis, we have heard little from MPs. Even the Liberal Democrats fail to display the urgent commitment needed to address this national crisis of liberty </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/simon_jenkins/article5014720.ece\">Simon Jenkins remarked</a> in his excellent farewell column from the Sunday Times yesterday, \"I have been amazed at the spinelessness of Britain's elected representatives on defending liberty and protesting against state arrogance.\"</p> <p>Where this will end I cannot say but I do know that historians of the future will regard the behaviour of parliament as one of the greatest abdications of responsibility that has ever taken place in a democracy. It is as shocking as it is bewildering.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Allen Stanford insists he is not opposed to Test cricket and believes it needs to exist alongside Twenty20. \"I think you have to look at it from two perspectives,\" he said. \"The foundation of the sport is Test cricket, the future of the game is Twenty20. Both can co-exist.\"</p> <p>After months of talk, the Stanford Super Series began on Saturday in Antigua with the Stanford Superstars claiming victory over Trinidad and Tobago in the curtain raiser. England launched their programme with a narrow victory over Middlesex on Sunday night, and the series is set to culminate in a much-hyped $20m winner-takes-all match against the Stanford Superstars.</p> <p>With the Indian Premier League having been launched earlier this year and the current series in the Caribbean, Twenty20's profile has grown exponentially in relation to Test cricket, to the chagrin of many who feel the latter is the pure form of the game. But Stanford believes both have an important role to play in cricket's future.</p> <p>\"Maybe one is more for the purist, maybe one is more for the younger, the 'want to see it now, be entertained now' crowd,\" he said. \"Like Lord's is the foundation of cricket, it's the beginning, it's the holy grail of cricket. You can no more do away with that which is Test cricket and replace it with Twenty20 than you can say that Test cricket is the only thing out there. [That] would be foolish because professional sport, unfortunately, is about money and Twenty20 is what is going to drive, commercially, the dollars in the door.\"</p> <p>The Texas billionaire has bankrolled the tournament in the West Indies and has been keen to get involved in the English game where the Twenty20 format originated. After extensive talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board earlier this year, an agreement was reached for England to take part. However, Stanford denied he had been completely in control of the negotiations with ECB chief executive David Collier and chairman Giles Clarke.</p> <p>\"I think that is a ludicrous statement,\" he said. \"They are not dancing to my tune, I respect them both greatly. The ECB had the best management structure in my estimation - you've got over two million involved in cricket in the UK all being managed under the ECB and they are not dancing to any tune I have laid out. We simply came to business terms and like most things in life it's chemistry and how well you work with people and I have worked extremely well with them. I have a lot of respect for both Giles and David and for the whole management structure and I think it was just a good mixture of all things.\"</p> <p>Stanford also believes the winner-takes-all match on Saturday represents an investment for the future. \"Twenty million dollars is a lot of money but it's not an enormous amount of money,\" he said. \"It is the single biggest pay-day in the history of team sports but in relative terms for what we have envisioned in this multi-billion sport it is really just an investment in the future.</p> <p>\"It's part of the bigger plan and that plan is to get this game into a commercially viable foothold. For it will be successful and make money and allow the West Indies to regain their rightful spot as the best in the world. You have to make investments, that makes sense today and tomorrow, this puts us on the world stage. We'll have at least 700 million people watching this event globally on Saturday on live television, and the $20m is what got us there.\"</p>",
  "<p>A West African court has found Niger's government guilty of failing to protect a 12-year-old who was sold into slavery in a landmark decision that may offer hope to thousands of others held in servitude in the region.</p> <p>Hadijatou Mani, who is now 24, had testified how she had been sold as a slave for $500 (\u00a3323) against her mother's wishes and regularly sexually abused and beaten for a decade. The regional ECOWAS Court ordered the government pay Mani $19,060 (\u00a312,310) in compensation.</p> <p>\"I am very happy with this decision,\" Mani told reporters yesterday outside the court in Naimey, Niger's capital. \"I feel that I am a human being like everyone else.\"</p> <p>Though the court dismissed a second part of the case, which accused the state of legitimising slavery by enforcing customary laws, the ruling is deeply embarrassing for Niger, where slave-status is passed down through generations. The government claims to have done all it can to eliminate the practice, but local and international campaign groups say that more than 43,000 people remain in servitude there. Slavery also remains a problem in Mali, Mauritania and Sudan, according to Anti-Slavery International, the British group that helped bring the case to court.</p> <p>During proceedings that attracted national attention, with senior political figures attending court sessions, Mani told of how in 1996 she had been sold to El Hadj Souleymane Naroua, a friend of the master of her mother, also a slave. Her status was that of a \"wahiya\", or sex-slave.</p> <p>Naroua, who was in his sixties and had seven other slaves, repeatedly raped Mani from the age of 13, and forced her to work long hours in his home and the fields without pay. Over the next 10 years, she bore three of his children.</p> <p>Niger criminalised slavery in 2003, and two years later Mani was given a \"liberation certificate\". But her freedom was short-lived. When she tried to marry a man of her own choosing, her master claimed they were legally married.</p> <p>Though a local court found in her favour, allowing her to proceed with the wedding, the decision was reversed on appeal. Mani was arrested, charged with bigamy and jailed for two months.</p> <p>Despite the ban on slavery, Niger's courts have been reluctant to find in favour of victims in recent years, and have imposed only light sentences on slave masters. Mani chose instead to pursue her case through ECOWAS, the West African regional body whose Community Court of Justice is based in neighbouring Nigeria.</p> <p>The panel of judges from Mali, Senegal and Togo ruled that Mani had been a \"victim of slavery\" and held \"the Republic of Niger responsible for the inaction\" of its social and legal services.</p> <p>Mossi Boubacar, a lawyer for Niger's government, told Reuters that the government accepted the court's verdict.</p> <p>\"We are law-abiding and will respect the decision,\" he said.</p> <p>Campaigners say that the verdict sends a strong signal to Niger and other countries in region that slavery will no longer be tolerated.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/syria-usa\">US military carried out an aerial attack</a> on Sunday against foreign insurgents holed up in Syria along the Iraqi border, US officials <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/world/middleeast/28syria.html?hp\">confirmed</a> today. Although details of the operation remain vague, the attack reportedly killed eight civilians and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/27/syria-iraq\">drew condemnation across the Muslim world</a>, from Damascus to Tehran. Similar bombings by US special forces have also been stepped up in recent weeks against <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/washington/27intel.html?hp\">al-Qaida and Taliban strongholds in northwest Pakistan</a>.</p> <p>Are such cross-border strikes wise policy, and should the next US president continue with them? The answer is no. Not only do such strikes violate state sovereignty - which also requires that states control their inhabitants - and end up killing civilians, but they are unproven to work, do nothing to address the socioeconomic conditions that invite terrorism and too often just turn local public opinion against us. </p> <p>By now it is conventional wisdom that counterinsurgencies are not won by military force but by political means. Yet the bulk of US defence spending continues to go toward military operations, not governance or reconstruction programmes. No wonder much of the Middle East hates us. Its locals must be given security and protection first if their - pardon the clich\u00e9 - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/27/us-iraq-propaganda-pentagon\">hearts and minds are to be won over</a>, similar to what we achieved in Anbar Province and the Brits achieved in Malaya many years back. </p> <p>The US strike against Syria is the latest in a series of cross-border attacks against non-state actors and provides an indication of what many wars in the future will resemble. Like Turkey's conflict with the PKK, Colombia's attack against the Farc in Ecuador or Israel's skirmish with Hizbullah, these kinds of conflicts will be fought primarily in the unruly frontiers of countries and entail cross-border incursions by special forces or surgical air strikes, not major ground operations against population centres. These wars will be more limited in scope yet more frequent in number. The circumstances under which they will be fought will be murkier and the casus belli less clear. There will be no victory parades after the cessation of hostilities because it will be difficult to determine the victors (after all, who won the war between Israel and Hizbullah?).</p> <p>And here's another stubborn truth the next US president must grapple with: The deck is stacked in favour of the non-state actor, not the state. That is because this kind of warfare is not waged over territory or ideology or religion, but is fought over hearts and minds - a public relations battle that cannot be measured in body counts. As the underdog, the non-state actor only has to stand up to Goliath, as it were, and its victory in the mind of the public is virtually sealed. \"How war is perceived has as much importance as how it actually is fought,\" historian <a href=\"http://www.danielpipes.org/article/3849\">Daniel Pipes noted</a> in the New York Sun in 2006. \"The Clausewitzian centre of gravity has moved from the battlefield to the op-eds and talking heads.\"<br> Hizbullah emerged from its July 2006 war with Israel arguably stronger and more popular among average Lebanese than before. Most Kurds have no love lost for the PKK, which has waged a violent, decades-long campaign for greater Kurdish autonomy against Turkey, but Ankara's heavy-handed response to the PKK has only endeared the PKK to local Kurds. They are now seen as freedom fighters, not terrorists. </p> <p>Does this kind of strategy limit war to the extent that states can accomplish their military objectives - wiping out terrorism - without losing the war of perception? History, unfortunately, shows it does not. The trouble is these raids are not forceful enough to dislodge the terrorist threat but just heavy-handed enough to turn local sympathies against the state. The outcome is a worst-of-both-worlds scenario: a prolonged conflict with local public opinion decidedly against the aggressor.</p> <p>To win this kind of war, a more patient approach is required. The better option is to rob terrorists of their local base of support by vastly improving conditions - social, economic, political - on the ground, something states should be doing anyway. Non-state actors' main lifeline is local support, without which they cannot establish sanctuaries, recruit locals to their cause and launch cross-border attacks. PKK support in southeastern Turkey waned (slightly) only after socioeconomic conditions improved for local Kurds, not as a result of Turkish bombings. If anything, the latter only exacerbated the situation and turned locals against Ankara, needlessly prolonging the conflict.</p> <p>Similarly, local sympathy for the Taliban along the Afghan-Pakistani border is driven as much by a lack of jobs as it is by religious or security concerns. The better off the locals, the less attractive the Taliban become, because the opportunity costs of siding with them become that much greater. Hizbullah is attractive to marginalised Lebanese not only because it delivers social services and provides security, but because the opportunity cost of siding with them against the state is not especially high.</p> <p>Also, it's often said that the state is at a disadvantage because governments must respond to voters, who demand immediate military progress and terrorists in body bags. Hence, there is an urgency to most governments' war aims. Not so with non-state actors, which can drag out their campaign of terror over years, if not decades. But I would flip this statement on its head: In fact, the longer the conflict, the greater the likelihood the non-state actor will overplay its hand and target civilians, which will turn the tide of public opinion against it.<br> In Turkey the bulk of the PKK-orchestrated attacks have killed ethnic Kurds, not Turks. In Anbar, those most affected by al-Qaida-orchestrated suicide bombs are local Sunnis, not US forces, which explained why al-Qaida got the boot last year. The same might hold true for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. If states give non-state actors enough rope, they will hang themselves. Time, so long as governments do not respond with disproportionate force, is actually on the side of the state.</p> <p>Of course, hawkish military types might think: Gee, if there is no threat of retaliation what's to stop terrorists from just attacking with impunity? Are states forever consigned to sit on their hands in the face of threats posed by non-state actors? Don't we have a legal and moral right to self-defence? Yes, we do. But if war were presented before the people honestly, a military spokesman would have to say: \"We can intervene militarily, but, barring a scorched-earth tactic a la the 1982 Hama massacre against Syria's Muslim Brotherhood, we are guaranteed to fail, lots of innocent lives will be lost and in the process we will turn local public opinion against us and only legitimise the terrorists.\"<br> The fact is such limited raids like the one this weekend by US forces against Syria do nothing to actually defeat terrorists. They are carried out to create the perception that Washington is taking forceful action and to strong-arm states like Syria into doing more to patrol their borders. But this policy risks losing what little support the US has among Muslims while killing civilians and creating more terrorists in the process. The next president would be wise to drop this kind of warfare from his counterterrorism playbook.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.brownbook.net\">Brownbook</a></strong> is a free, wiki-based business directory that anyone can edit, and recently launched a mobile version that lets users download contact details of businesses straight to their phones. The site claims that 27m businesses are already listed, including 2m in the UK, but competition is stiff - not just with other directory services like Yell but with big search players like Google dominating local and national search.</p> <p>Brownbook hopes its easy-to-edit feature will set it apart from the competition, and it trying to expand its reach by offering a <a href=\"http://www.localmouth.com/go/winchester/businesses\">white-label version for other sites</a>.

  "<p>Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/economy-gordonbrown\">preparing to ride roughshod</a> over New Labour's fiscal targets to \"maintain growth and output\". But the conversion to \"Keynesian economics\" is based on a misunderstanding. </p> <p>Keynes did not advocate using fiscal policy first and foremost. Securing lower borrowing costs, to stop defaults from spiralling upwards, was far more important. Without that, there was a real danger more government borrowing would \"crowd out\" the private sector. </p> <p>We should remember that Japan spent vast sums during the 1990s, eventually pushing its public sector debt to GDP ratio up to an unthinkable 175%. And it is still in trouble. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/27/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">Nikkei 225 has just hit a 26-year low</a>. </p> <p>And events of recent weeks underline the risks. Bank recapitalisations and guaranteeing their debts are indirectly driving private sector borrowing costs higher. </p> <p>Corporate bond yields have soared across the west. More and more companies will be shut out of credit markets, unable to refinance. They will default, sending unemployment up even more quickly next year. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, stock markets are stumbling. There is a real risk that the entire bull market stretching back to 1990 will unravel, with severe repercussions for savings and pensions. Governments may then be forced to extend its control of the economy to include companies, life insurers and even more banks. </p> <p>Rates will be cut at the MPC's next meeting. Eventually, we could see Japanese style interest rates of 0.0%. A zero interest rate policy may become the norm across the west. </p> <p>But we cannot assume that will work. Japan's central bank was also obliged to drive government bond yields down to below 1%. It started to buy government debt in the spring of 2001. If the governments in the west are intent on borrowing heavily, they have to fund that by expanding the central banks' balance sheets. Governments have to borrow from central banks. Otherwise, private sector borrowing costs will remain elevated. </p> <p>Even that may not suffice. We may soon arrive at the point where the extreme monetary policies seen in Japan will not work today. From 2003 onwards, Japan also had the support of a strong China, bouyant housing markets in the west and rapid credit growth in emerging market economies, to support its exporters. </p> <p>Some argue that a devaluation of sterling will provide similar support in the UK. Mervyn King was at least right on one score last week. The huge external funding gap faced by UK banks does make sterling acutely vulnerable. It is also one important factor behind the Libor freeze, and why it is proving so hard to unblock. Collapsing emerging markets will cause a further withdrawal of funds for UK banks. Sterling may continue to slide. </p> <p>But there is one critical difference. The devaluation of the yen in 2003 worked because the world economy was strong. Those expecting a lower sterling to rescue the UK from a similar debt trap will be disappointed. </p> <p>It will also take years to replace the jobs lost from outsourcing and globalisation under New Labour. </p> <p>It is a pity Darling and Brown have converted to a so-called Keynesian policy without studying the real lessons of Japan's experience during the 1990s. Their actions are increasing the risks of a prolonged recession and record unemployment.</p>",
  "<p>A court in west Africa today convicted Niger of failing to protect a young girl sold into slavery in a landmark judgment with potentially far-reaching implications for the tens of thousands of enslaved Africans.</p> <p>The justice arm of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) ruled that Niger failed in its obligations to protect Hadijatou Mani.</p> <p>Mani, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/26/human-rights-niger-verdict\">brought the test case</a> with the assistance of British anti-slavery groups, said she was sold into slavery at the age of 12 for about \u00a3325 and regularly beaten and sexually abused.</p> <p>The court dismissed a second element of the case that accused Niger's government of legitimising slavery through customary laws that campaigners say discriminate against women.</p> <p>Slavery remains common in rural areas of Niger despite it being officially abolished five years ago.</p> <p>\"I am very happy with this decision,\" Mani told Reuters after the ruling was announced.</p> <p>The court, sitting in the capital, Niamey, ordered the state to pay her 10 million CFA francs (about \u00a312,000) in damages and accumulated interest.</p> <p>\"We are law-abiding and will respect this decision,\" Mossi Boubacar, a legal official for Niger's government, told Reuters.</p> <p>The ruling by the panel of judges from Senegal, Mali and Togo is the first time Ecowas has been asked to rule on slavery. It is binding for all the organisation's 15 member nations.</p> <p>Slavery was officially outlawed in Mauritania in 1981 but some human rights groups estimate up to 20% of the country's 3m people are still enslaved. A Malian human rights group, Temedt, estimated there were at least 7,000 slaves in just one region of the country, Gao.</p> <p>Anti-Slavery International described how slaves in Niger were owned and completely controlled by their masters, receiving only minimal food and a place to sleep in return for their labour. </p> <p>Speaking before today's judgment, Mani said: \"It was very difficult to challenge my former master and to speak out when people see you as nothing more than a slave. But I knew that this was the only way to protect my child from suffering the same fate. Nobody deserves to be enslaved.\"</p> <p>The life of a sadaka, or sexual slave, was described in detail by Mani during the court case. She explained how she had been born a slave, sold and then transferred as a child to a man against her mother's wishes. She testified that she was raped at 13 and constantly forced to have sex with her 63-year-old master, who owned seven other slaves.</p> <p>In 2005, two years after Niger enacted a law forbidding slavery, Mani was presented with a liberation certificate. This proved to be worthless, as she was immediately forced into a \"wahiya marriage\", giving her the status of a concubine.</p> <p>When she fled and married another man, her master had her arrested and charged with bigamy. She was imprisoned for two months on remand.</p> <p>The issue has become deeply embarrassing for the government of Niger, which has failed to act on evidence of continued and widespread slavery in rural areas.</p>",

But at the funerals of the victims today, an Associated Press photographer saw the bodies of seven men.</p> <p>Moualem warned of military retaliation if there were future cross-border raids, saying: \"If they do it again, we will defend our territory.\"</p> <p>Washington has said it targeted foreign fighters in the raid.</p> <p>Moualem said: \"They [the US] know we stand against al-Qaida.

Russia and Iran have condemned the US action. </p> <p>Syrian state television said the attack was on a farm near Abu Kamal, five miles from the Iraqi border. </p> <p>Doctors in nearby al-Sukkariya said another seven people were taken to hospital with bullet wounds.</p> <p>The attack threatens to unleash a new wave of anti-US feeling in Syria and across the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East</a>.</p> <p>During the funeral procession, a crowd of angry residents shouted anti-US slogans and carried banners reading \"Down with Bush and the American enemy.\"</p> <p>The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, is being courted by Europe and had been looking forward to improved relations with Washington after the US presidential election on November 4.</p> <p>News of the attack has led news bulletins across the Arab world. The Syrian Tishin newspaper called it a \"US war crime\".</p> <p>Syria summoned the US charge d'affaires in Damascus to explain the attack and called on the Iraqi government to prevent its airspace from being used this way again.</p> <p>\"This is an outrageous raid which is against international law,\" the Syrian ambassador to London, Sami al-Khiyami, told Reuters. \"It is a terrible crime. We are expecting clarifications from the Americans.\"</p> <p>Witnesses said eight US soldiers landed in two helicopters and killed building workers. </p> <p>A senior Syrian source, quoted by the official Sana news agency, said four helicopters violated Syrian airspace. The source described the target as a \"civilian building under construction\".</p> <p>In Washington, an unnamed military official told the Associated Press news agency that the raid targeted elements of a \"foreign fighter logistics network\".</p> <p>It was because of Syrian inaction, the official said, that the US was \"taking matters into our own hands\". It is the first known US attack on Syrian soil.</p> <p>\"The attacked area was the scene of activities of terrorist groups operating from Syria against Iraq,\" Ali al-Dabbagh, an Iraqi government spokesman, told Reuters.</p> <p>Farhan al-Mahalawi, the mayor of the Iraqi border town of Qaim, told Reuters that the targeted village had been surrounded by Syrian troops.</p> <p>The Iraqi foreign ministry under-secretary, Labid Abbawi, said: \"We are trying to contain the fallout from the incident.

Last year, Israel destroyed an alleged nuclear site in northern Syria.</p> <p>Qaim has been a significant crossing point for foreign fighters, weapons and money entering Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency. </p> <p>Last Thursday, the commander of US forces in western Iraq told reporters that US troops were redoubling efforts to secure the Syrian border. Major General John Kelly said Iraq's western borders with Saudi Arabia and Jordan were fairly tight as a result of good policing by security forces in those countries, but Syria was \"a different story\".</p> <p>Thabet Salem, a political analyst, told the Arabic-language al-Jazeera TV news channel that the US appeared to have mistaken building workers for infiltrators.</p> <p>\"It will raise questions as to why this is happening towards the end of the current US administration,\" he said.</p> <p>Last year, the then US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, praised Syria's cooperation in reducing violence in Iraq. </p> <p>But Syria has since refused to restart intelligence-sharing with the US until Washington recognises its assistance by returning an ambassador to Damascus.</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne today admitted he had made a \"mistake\" over his decision to discuss party fundraising with friends of a Russian oligarch.</p> <p>Speaking for the first time since his statement last week setting out his involvement in talks about an alleged \u00a350,000 donation to the Conservative party, the shadow chancellor said he now regretted the incident.</p> <p>\"I neither asked for money nor received any, but I did make a mistake,\" he said. \"It didn't look very good, and I regret that.\"</p> <p>Osborne said he had now changed his role as a party fundraiser.</p> <p>Asked on the BBC's World at One whether he acknowledged that he showed a lack of judgment in his dealings with the Russian aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska, Osborne replied: \"I think the real judgment is: can you learn from mistakes you make? I have changed the way that I am going to operate when it comes to fundraising and I will not discuss individual donations with individual donors.</p> <p>\"That, I think, is an appropriate thing for me to do.\"</p> <p>The shadow chancellor agreed to the reduction in his role after discussions with the Tory party leader, David Cameron, the Times reported .</p> <p>Osborne was last week forced to admit he had been involved in a conversation at the villa of financier Nat Rothschild about the way a donation could be secured from Deripaska.</p> <p>Rothschild, a regular fundraiser for the Conservatives, revealed he was willing to go to court to prove his claim that Osborne had not only wanted to secure a donation from the Russian, but had been party to discussions as to how this could be made legal.</p> <p>Rothschild claimed Osborne had been present when the party's chief executive and fundraiser, Andrew Feldman, had suggested the money could be channelled through LDV, a British firm owned by Deripaska.</p> <p>It is not illegal to accept a donation from a registered UK company, but could be in breach of section 61 of the 2000 political parties law prohibiting entering into or acting \"in furtherance of\" any arrangement disguising an overseas donation.</p> <p>In his detailed statement last week, Osborne insisted that at no point did he or Feldman \"suggest ways of channelling a donation\".</p> <p>Rothschild, an old and close friend of Osborne's, went public after he became enraged at the way the shadow chancellor had, he felt, abused his hospitality. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/peter-mandelson-oleg-deripaska\">He was furious Osborne had breached confidences about his conversations with Lord Mandelson</a>, the business secretary, while the politicians were private guests at Rothschild's luxury Corfu villa in August.</p> <p>Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, told the BBC: \"He [Osborne] did show very bad judgment in meeting this guy [Deripaska] five times.</p> <p>\"If he is effectively apologising I am sure that is the line under his particular involvement.\"</p> <p>In a separate development, the European commission today attempted to draw a line under the growing clamour for full disclosure about Mandelson's official contacts during his four years as the EU's trade commissioner.</p> <p>Officials in Brussels said there were no grounds for an official investigation into Mandelson's behaviour, and insisted they would not make public the list of high-level professional links that would reveal the extent of his relationship with Deripaska.</p> <p>And although there are strict rules under the commission's code of conduct about entertainment and the registration of gifts, commissioners do not have to declare or register what they do or who they spend time with on holiday.</p> <p>A commission spokesman said: \"It is for Mr Mandelson to decide if he wishes to provide a list of his social engagements.</p> <p>\"The commission's position remains clear that we are not aware of circumstances suggesting any breach of rules or a conflict of interest.</p> <p>\"No evidence for such claims has been brought forward. The commission considers therefore that there are no grounds for an investigation.\"</p> <p>In the last fortnight the most senior commission official in Mandelson's department, trade director-general David O'Sullivan, has issued a statement insisting Mandelson had not unduly interfered in decisions on aluminium imports which benefited Deripaska to the tune of millions of pounds a year.</p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the transport secretary, responding to Osborne's remarks, said: \"George Osborne's judgement is wrong.

  "<p>One of the police marksmen who killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> could have stopped the Brazilian before he entered Stockwell underground station but his superiors did not tell him to do so, he told an inquest today.</p> <p>The member of Scotland Yard's elite CO19 specialist firearms unit, named only as C12, admitted he neglected to tell senior officers he was in a position to stop De Menezes.</p> <p>C12 broke down last week as he recounted the moment he shot De Menezes on July 22 2005.</p> <p>C12 said he had not heard his colleagues on the radio saying no firearms team members would be able to get there in time to stop De Menezes.</p> <p>De Menezes, 27, was shot seven times in the head at point blank range shortly after he boarded a train at Stockwell in south London. He had been followed from a nearby block of flats by police who mistakenly believed he was Hussein Osman, one of a group of would-be suicide bombers whose devices failed to detonate properly the day before.</p> <p>De Menezes was pursued into Stockwell station by C12 and other police officers. They shot him because they feared he was carrying a bomb.</p> <p>Under cross-examination by Michael Mansfield QC, for the Menezes family, C12 said he had been sitting in an unmarked car outside Stockwell station awaiting instructions when De Menezes arrived on the bus.</p> <p>\"Did you hear any radio traffic from the firearms team saying, 'We can't do it [intercept him] - we're not there'?\" Mansfield asked.</p> <p>C12 replied: \"No, sir.\"</p> <p>Mansfield continued: \"Because the truth was, you were there and you could have done it, couldn't you?\"</p> <p>C12 answered: \"Yes, sir.\"</p> <p>C12 then apologised for failing to tell his superiors he had been in a position to intercept De Menezes. \"You are correct: the onus was on me in that situation,\" he told Mansfield. \"I was listening to the radio, waiting to pick up what I could and waiting for a decision to come through.</p> <p>\"The only explanation I am offering to you is that things happened so quickly as we came closer. Why I did not tell them where I was, I just cannot tell you. I was trying to listen to the radio, I had a lot going on, and if that is an error, then, you know, I apologise for it.\"</p> <p>Later, C12 insisted he did shout a warning at De Menezes inside the tube carriage before opening fire. Mansfield alleged some witnesses at the scene did not hear any verbal warning and asked the firearms officer if he thought he had \"made a serious mistake\".</p> <p>C12 replied: \"No, I don't.\"</p> <p>The officer said he distinctly remembered shouting \"armed police\" at De Menezes because afterwards he thought \"Why the hell did I challenge him?\" as this might have caused a would-be suicide bomber to detonate their device.</p> <p>C12 accepted he had been fearful when approaching De Menezes. \"Fear was certainly there, but as regard to controlling my actions it is possible it had some impact, yes. I cannot deny that. I thought I was going to die and I took action to stop that,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked by Mansfield whether he was not in control \"because of fear\", the officer replied: \"No, not at all sir. I was in control of myself.\"</p> <p>The inquest is being held at the Oval cricket ground in south London.</p>",
  "<p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/religion-advertising\">Ariane Sherine</a>, with some financial backing from ubiquitous atheist <a href=\"http://www.richarddawkins.net/\">Richard Dawkins</a>, launched a campaign to raise \u00a311,000 to fund atheist adverts on London buses. Within 10 hours, she'd hit her target. The total raised has now topped \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>It's a great idea, but as it stands it's something of a missed opportunity. What will these adverts accomplish? Primarily, they'll offset those unavoidable adverts for the wretched <a href=\"http://uk.alpha.org/\">Alpha course</a>, which is bound to annoy that very small minority of British Christians who feel only their views have validity. Which can only be a good thing. But they've got the potential to do much more: here's a great chance to produce a little more solid evidence towards (dis)proving the existence of God himself.</p> <p>Yes, it's true that it's impossible to prove there's no God. But as you also can't prove there's not an intangible, invisible monkey sitting on your shoulder as you read this, that's perhaps not the best clinching argument going. Especially as you can't even prove that your shoulder-monkey won't work to thwart your life's ambitions in subtle ways unless you pay me a tenner. In fact, if I'm ever particularly hard up, I may just have founded that religion. Hell, it worked for <a href=\"http://www.lronhubbard.org/\">L Ron Hubbard</a>, after all.</p> <p>What we can look for is any evidence of the Almighty's handiwork on earth. Many atheists maintain their world view is based on evidence, not faith, which is an admirable policy, but does imply some slight duty towards gathering that evidence. While extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, if we can gather some counter-evidence without too much exertion or cost, it's well worthwhile.</p> <p>And many attempts to do this, to date, have been less than inspired, ranging from the tragic to the feeble. A 45-year-old eastern European philosopher died last year after lowering himself into a tiger cage declaring, \"God, if he exists, will protect me.\" </p> <p>Charlie Brooker took a less risky but not much more convincing approach in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/16/religion.uk1\">column</a> a few years ago. \"In summary: a mere sore throat is proof enough that there is no God \u2013 or that if there is, he doesn't give a toss about human suffering. In which case, why bother worshipping him?\"</p> <p>Neither is likely to win awards for good experimental design. A good experiment has a control group \u2013 for a drugs trial, this is the group given sugar pills instead of our new drug, just to allow accurate comparison. It's carried out in as natural an environment as possible. Ideally, no one involved has to die.</p> <p>And this is where our newly atheistic buses come in: come January, London will have three distinct groups of buses. First up, at least 30 buses will be emblazoned with banner advertising rubbishing the idea of God. In all likelihood, at least 30 others will be encouraging a new generation of recruits to sign up to the Alpha course. And the rest will be their usual secular selves: in other words, a perfect control group.</p> <p>So what I propose is this: let's track the punctuality of these three groups (or as many as we can track, randomly selected from each group). We can log breakdowns and accidents too, for good measure. The adverts are being paid for anyway, the breakdowns and punctuality of the buses involved are already measured by <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/\">Transport for London</a>, so with a little goodwill and some help from a professional statistician, we've got a solid natural experiment. After all, if anything could do with a little divine intervention, it's our capital's transport system.</p> <p>The most likely outcome, I'd guess, would be no statistically significant difference between any of the three groups. If the Alpha buses significantly outperform the other groups, there's pause for thought (if they float heavenwards amid a chorus of angelic harpists, it'll be quite a long pause). If the buses sporting atheist adverts did significantly better, something out there perhaps has a warped sense of humour.</p> <p>Some proper experiments along these lines have been done before. Here is a 2001 <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=1322&amp;UID=\">paper</a> into the effects of prayer on patients recovering in coronary care, which found prayer had no significant impact on patients' recovery. Science might be \"boring\" and slow, but just as dripping water eventually moves mountains, the slow accumulation of such evidence might yet do the same.</p> <p>Sceptic extraordinaire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/series/badscience\">Ben Goldacre</a> recently commented you \"cannot reason someone out of a position they did not reason themselves into\". If Britain's atheists are spending \u00a3100,000 of our hard-earned cash \u2013 during a recession, no less \u2013 in an attempt to do so, we might as well learn something out of it in the process.</p>",
  "<p>The urgency of the current situation cannot be overemphasized: The latest scientific research tells us that global warming is accelerating at a rate beyond previous expectations, and that the window for a timely response is closing quickly. Despite some political efforts to muddy the waters, there is scientific agreement that greenhouse gas emissions must now be stabilized within seven years or the world will face unpredictable climate-related catastrophes \u2014 far beyond the serious impacts already in evidence globally.</p> <p>Climate action in the United States \u2014 at a federal standstill for the last eight years \u2014 is expected to finally move forward with the inauguration of a new president in January. What preparations can be made now to assure action within the first 100 days? Congress is expected to try to move cap-and-trade legislation again while also addressing related issues: energy, transportation, economic policy, and conservation. But the key question remains: Is there a leadership strategy that the next president can initiate to strengthen the likelihood of success, particularly during this time of economic crisis?</p> <p>The latest science demands a strategy that provides a policy pathway that will begin to reduce emissions immediately, and a political pathway that avoids continued gridlock. Relying on a single piece of legislation runs the risk of failing to meet one or both of these nonnegotiable requirements. It could easily take more than seven years to get a federal carbon-trading mechanism to stabilize emissions. It's also possible that congressional compromise will water down cap-and-trade emissions targets and, worse, undermine existing state and regional efforts.</p> <p>There is, however, a promising alternative strategy increasingly under discussion by a growing number of legal authorities, politicians, and policy experts: Activate the Clean Air Act \u2014 arguably the most cost-effective environmental law in the US \u2014 and use it to control greenhouse gas emissions. Such a move would not require controversial new legislation and would be on solid legal footing, thanks to the US Supreme Court's landmark 2007 decision, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which affirmed that carbon dioxide emissions are a pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act and can therefore be regulated by the EPA.</p> <p>That ruling is now informing Sen. Barack Obama's thinking. Jason Grumet, his energy adviser, said this month that if elected president, Sen. Obama would declare CO2 a dangerous pollutant under the Clean Air Act and use the act to limit emissions. Experts do not dispute the executive branch's authority to do so.</p> <p>\"EPA has the authority to regulate sources of pollution directly and could set emissions standards for new stationary sources of pollution \u2014 such as coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, and steel and concrete plants \u2014 in relatively short order,\" said Lisa Heinzerling, professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, who wrote the petitioners' brief in Massachusetts v EPA. </p> <p>She and many other legal experts believe that under the Clean Air Act, the EPA can also administer a national cap-and-trade program by writing federal rules to unify independent regional carbon markets. Already, 23 states and four Canadian provinces are forming such markets, with 10 additional states being brought into the process as observers. Experts believe the EPA can promulgate an additional set of regulations that would control transportation emissions \u2014 everything from cars and trucks to boats and airplanes.</p> <p>\"The high court essentially said the United States currently has a law for regulating carbon dioxide emissions, and it's called the Clean Air Act,\" said John Dernbach, a professor at Widener University Law School. Dernbach, who writes extensively on climate change, co-authored a friend-of-the-court brief in the landmark case on behalf of 18 prominent climate scientists.</p> <p>This means that two branches of government \u2014 Congress, which enacted the law, and the Supreme Court, which confirmed its applicability to carbon dioxide \u2014 have already set the stage for an executive branch willing to implement the existing law to control greenhouse gas emissions. The next president can step into office and lay out a comprehensive strategy for a national climate plan that uses the Clean Air Act and identifies areas for congressional action. The moment is ripe for such bold executive leadership.</p> <p>Robert McKinstry, a partner in the environmental group at the law firm of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews &amp; Ingersoll and a co-author of the brief with Dernbach, also believes that the act offers a parallel, lower-cost, and faster avenue for establishing a national carbon market than completely new legislation. He points to existing regional carbon-trading efforts as mechanisms that offer a head start.</p> <p>Three regional programs are already in development \u2014 the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast, the Western Climate Initiative, and the Midwest Governors Greenhouse Gas Accord.</p> <p>The first already has held its first carbon credit auctions and will begin regulating power plant emissions in January. Taken together, these initiatives to combat global warming now cover areas that include half the US population, and state governments are already considering how to harmonize regional trading systems with each other, as well as with the European Union's emissions-trading scheme. In addition, 39 states \u2014 and most Canadian provinces and Mexican states \u2014 established a climate registry to measure emissions, a cornerstone of an eventual national U.S. market.</p> <p>This evolving US carbon marketplace can provide the framework around which a national system can grow from the bottom up, McKinstry maintains. Many experts do not believe the EPA can establish a carbon trading mechanism on its own authority. But they agree that states can do so, and that the EPA can play the role of regulator by writing federal trading rules. Why not allow the best-equipped federal agency to oversee and coordinate the ongoing development of regional carbon markets, which are already way ahead of anything likely to emerge anytime soon from new federal legislation?</p> <p>It is tricky legal terrain and the debate among experts, who are now submitting recommendations to the EPA about how to apply the Clean Air Act to greenhouse gas emissions, will require the skills of a Talmudic scholar to follow. Some experts \u2014 including Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board \u2014 believe that the act could be amended to provide a specific global climate focus, perhaps through a new title, as was done for acid rain in 1990. \"There is no reason to abandon a legislative framework that has worked well,\" says Nichols.</p> <p>California has demonstrated to the nation how the law could be put to work to reduce greenhouse gases. The state asked the EPA for a waiver to impose more stringent auto-emissions standards than the current federal ones. Seventeen other states were ready to adopt the California standards, but the Bush EPA has refused. By instructing the EPA to grant this long-delayed waiver, the next president could significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector with the stroke of a pen. The agency is sitting on eight other petitions that would reduce emissions from other mobile sources, such as trucks, locomotives, boats, and airplanes. This kind of rule-making \u2014 not lawmaking \u2014 immediately shifts the status quo from argument to action by applying already available regulatory mechanisms.</p> <p>The Clean Air Act \u2014 first passed in 1963, with later amendments \u2014 is a mature, flexible, and successful law designed to integrate the work of all economic sectors and all levels of government. By applying the Clean Air Act, the next president can stand on the shoulders of legal and regulatory precedent. He can adopt an executive-branch strategy to complement the next round of legislative efforts. He can lead climate policy development by using existing authority and can ensure that the US has a strong position going into the next round of international climate negotiations. And action in the first 100 days can set the stage for genuine US re-engagement in international climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009.</p> <p>An energy crisis, a climate crisis, and an economic crisis have joined forces in a perfect storm, which now requires a sound and swift response based on new thinking. Using the Clean Air Act to bring America's runaway greenhouse gas emissions under control could give the next president the tools he needs to respond to this challenge as well as leverage to use with Congress for broader action.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\" title=\"\">Tottenham</a> manager Harry Redknapp has admitted he is interested in bringing Jermain Defoe back to White Hart Lane if the England striker becomes available.</p> <p>Defoe left Spurs for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth\" title=\"\">Portsmouth</a> in January after finding his opportunities limited but the departures of Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane mean he would command a regular starting place if he moved back. \"If he [Defoe] ever came back up for sale then I'm sure we would be interested,\" said Redknapp, who heard fans sing the forward's name during yesterday's 2-0 win over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bolton\" title=\"\">Bolton</a>.</p> <p>After arriving from Portsmouth at the weekend, Redknapp will have full control of transfers after the Spurs chairman Daniel Levy scrapped the club's continental structure. Tottenham have previously been linked with the Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra, while Redknapp has been credited with resurrecting the careers of players such as England goalkeeper David James.</p> <p>Defoe would offer options in attack, to bolster ranks which currently include Roman Pavlyuchenko, Darren Bent and the on-loan Fraizer Campbell.</p> <p>Redknapp is expected to use Luka Modric in a free role behind a lone striker until January after the Croatia playmaker put in a man-of-the-match performance against Bolton. Modric, the \u00a316.5m summer signing from Dinamo Zagreb, had struggled to make an impact before yesterday's win.</p> <p>\"I felt that's his position, behind the front man,\" Redknapp said. \"That's where he needs to play so that's where we decided to play him against Bolton. If you give him the ball, he'll do special things and has got great awareness. And he mucks in as well.\"</p> <p>Redknapp's appointment has been welcomed by Spurs players, with suggestions senior players were unhappy with head coach Juande Ramos in the final weeks before his dismissal on Saturday. \"I think the appointment is brilliant,\" the captain Ledley King said. \"Harry has been there before with teams and produced his magic and I'm very confident he can do it with us.</p> <p>\"Harry came in and told the players, 'You are good players but it's about confidence.' He believes we can get out of it and we responded. The players seem to have a weight off their shoulders against Bolton for some reason. That was more like us.\"</p> <p>Another encouraging sign for Redknapp was King completing a second game in four days for the first time in 10 months, and the central defender hopes to play against Arsenal on Wednesday at the Emirates Stadium. \"It felt good to be out there,\" he said. \"I would love to play against Arsenal but we'll look at the situation and see.\"</p> <p>Redknapp has brought in Kevin Bond as a coach and he will also bring in at least one assistant, with the former Spurs midfielder Tim Sherwood in the frame. Ramos, meanwhile, has been linked with jobs in Spain with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>",
  "<p>The police are being given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/project-midas-fingerprint-scanner-liberty\">portable fingerprint scanners</a>, \"so that they can check people's identities in the street\". There's no clear explanation offered of what value this is under the current law, where we are entitled to go about our lawful business without identifying ourselves to the police. The police just aren't entitled to \"check your identity\" \u2013 whatever that means. And actually those ministers busily selling the national identity scheme for the past four years have been quick to emphasise that fact \u2013 usually as part of a straw man argument misattributed to people like me.</p> <p>The police do not generally have any difficulty identifying suspects. Their problem is finding evidence to convict a particular person of a crime. (That is where fingerprints do find their way into a minority of criminal cases \u2013 usually as corroboration of other evidence.) Fingerprinting wouldn't be useful if a suspect hadn't already been arrested and fingerprinted, so it could easily be a waste of time.</p> <p>Online matches to large databases also have a significant error rate. It wouldn't be a method of choice. It might be fruitless. It might lead to wrongful arrests. Even conventional fingerprint matching has done that.</p> <p>So what has changed? How is it supposed to help? Section 117 of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050015_en_1\">Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005</a> (the act that banned unlicensed demonstrations within a kilometre of parliament) amended existing legislation in order to expand the powers of police to fingerprint suspects. But it is still necessary that the officer reasonably suspects you of an offence, and that he cannot ascertain your name (by, say, asking you) or has reasonable grounds for thinking you have given a false one. In other words, you can only be forced to give fingerprints for one of these new machines when you could be arrested anyway.</p> <p>Are there a lot of cases where the officer thinks a crime has been committed, thinks the offender is trying to escape by giving a false name, but also thinks arrest is not warranted? There would have to be, to justify kitting out whole forces with these readers. Or should we be worried that people will come under pressure to give their fingerprints as \"a matter of routine\" and failure to do so will be deemed suspicious in itself?</p> <p>Come along, Sir. Nothing to hide, have we?</p> <p>Though the legislation limits the scope of the check, the limits are pretty broad \u2013records held by or on behalf of \"relevant law enforcement authorities\". Could that stretch to cover the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/passports-and-immigration/id-cards/how-the-data-will-be-used/\">National Identity Register</a>? The fingerprints themselves are required to be destroyed \"after they have fulfilled the purpose\" \u2013 but what if the identification sought fails, as it would (or, rather, should) if someone new to police records is checked? And nothing requires the fact of the check to be deleted from the record. Give your fingerprints with any degree of willingness and you will at the very least be tagged as \"suspect\" in some database, perhaps more than one, indefinitely.</p> <p>One thing is plain. History shows we cannot trust the government to constrain unlawful use of a new toy by overzealous forces. In 2000 the courts declared unlawful the standard police practice of hanging on, forever, to DNA records of unconvicted people. No illegal samples were destroyed as a result. Instead the present government changed the law retrospectively to make it all legal after all.</p>",

  "<p>What follows is a background document on slavery in Niger compiled by <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/\">Anti-Slavery International</a>. It assisted Hadijatou Mani in bringing her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/niger-slave-court\">landmark court case</a> against the government of the country.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Slavery was abolished in Niger in 1960 (upon independence from France), prohibited in 1999 and criminalised in 2003.</p> <h2>How many slaves are there in Niger?</h2> <p>The minimum estimate is that 43,000 people are in slavery across Niger. </p> <p>It is based on research by Timidria, a local human rights organisation, and Anti-Slavery International. The research involved more than 11,000 face-to-face interviews in six regions of the country, constituting the most comprehensive survey of slavery in Niger to date.</p> <h2>Who practises slavery?</h2> <p>Slavery remains deeply embedded in Niger society. It exists across the country, in rural and urban areas, and is practised predominantly by the Tuareg, Maure (Berber Arab) and Peule (also known as Pulaar, or Fulani) ethnic groups. </p> <p>Some Hausa follow the \"fifth wife\" practice - a form of slavery (see below). The Hausa (both in Niger and Nigeria) are sold their \"fifth wife\" by Tuareg masters. </p> <h2>How do people become slaves in Niger?</h2> <p>Virtually all cases of slavery documented in Niger concern individuals whose ancestors were enslaved many generations ago. Slavery status is ascribed at birth and passed on through the generations. </p> <p>The Tuareg follow a complicated caste system that incorporates slaves at the bottom of society. </p> <p>Tuareg culture does not allow people to marry outside their caste. It is significant that, in Niger, slaves identify themselves as Tuareg even if their ancestry technically belongs to African people enslaved by Tuareg raiders. </p> <p>Nobles and warriors are at the top of Tuareg culture, and Islamic clerics, or marabouts, come next. Below them are free men, followed by casted groups such as blacksmiths and other occupations. </p> <p>Below all these are freed slaves; the lowest rung is reserved for slaves. All these free and casted groups can have slaves - even slaves themselves, if they have the financial means. </p> <p>A slave can be freed in Tuareg culture by his or her master, if they wish to appease Allah to make amends for an indiscretion, or simply out of kindness. </p> <p>Historically, slaves could be freed if they acted with distinction and valour in battle. Despite this, freed slaves remain near the bottom of the Tuareg caste system, above only slaves. </p> <h2>What does it mean to be a slave?</h2> <p>Slaves have no rights and no opportunities in life. </p> <p>In Niger, people are born into slavery and forced to work without pay for their so-called masters throughout their lives, primarily herding cattle or working on farmland, or as domestic servants. </p> <p>Slaves are denied fundamental rights, and their masters exercise powers of ownership over them. Slaves are inherited, and given as gifts. Children may be taken away from their mothers at an early age. </p> <p>Girls are forced to start work as domestic servants at a very young age, and are at the continual beck and call of their masters. They may be sexually abused by men in the household or forced to marry at a young age. </p> <p>Women have spoken of living in constant fear of abuse, and rape is common. </p> <p>Masters also consider that they have the right to demand the marriage dowry of their former slaves (which may consist of a bed, a tent or kitchen utensils). When a former slave dies, the master can demand the inheritance, even if the former slave has children. </p> <p>Even when former slaves have been free for many years, the master will assume the right to approve their marriage or inherit their property. </p> <p>Many slaves are not on the electoral roll, and so are not entitled to vote. This political exclusion enables those in power to maintain the status quo. </p> <h2>Slavery and the misuse of Islam</h2> <p>Slaves are told that, under Islam, their paradise is bound to their master, and that if they do what the master tells them, they will go to heaven. </p> <p>This is a powerful mechanism of control, teaching those who are enslaved to follow orders and accept their fate or they will be forsaken by God and live outside Islam. </p> <p>Without access to education or alternative means of subsistence, many believe that it is Allah's wish for them to be slaves when in reality Islam dictates that a Muslim may not enslave a fellow Muslim.<br> </p> <h2>'Fifth wives'</h2> <p>Islam allows a man to take a maximum of four wives. However, in Niger, the practice exists of taking a fifth wife. These women are known as wahiya among the Tuareg and sadaka among the Hausa. </p> <p>Sometimes men take several fifth wives. The fifth wife does not receive any of the status benefits of being a wife, as there is no actual marriage. She is, in effect, a slave to her \"husband\". </p> <p>In 2006, Timidria helped release 34 women known to have been sold as fifth wives in the Canton of Douguerawa. A further 12 were released in 2007. </p> <p>Anti-Slavery International was able to interview 10 of the women, who complained they had been subjugated to forced and unpaid labour, rape and daily insults.</p>",

The only magic at Home Park, though, came from visiting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ipswich\" title=\"\">Ipswich Town</a>, who were comfortable 3-1 winners.</p> <p>\u2022 Quote of the weekend: \"I think that there is some feeling that I am not stimulating the players into a meaningful performance, but there is also the feeling that people have to stimulate themselves.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/carlisle\" title=\"\">Carlisle</a> manager John Ward after his side's 5-0 defeat to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/colchester\" title=\"\">Colchester</a>. We think he means motivate.</p> <p>\u2022 We should offer a huge pat on the back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/northampton\" title=\"\">Northampton Town</a>. Last week the Cobblers gave 500 free tickets to local cabbies for their game against Yeovil as part of a campaign to reward unsung workers in the community. Previously this season 500 market traders have gained free entry to Sixfields. And they've been lucky enough to see some good football - Northampton remain undefeated at home and earned a valuable point at the Walkers Stadium on Saturday.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale\" title=\"\">Rochdale</a> romped to a 3-1 win over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/aldershot\" title=\"\">Aldershot</a> to stay within reach of the play-offs and the Dale players now have an extra motivation to end their 34-year stay in the bottom tier. Kitman Jack Northover has pledged to do a naked skydive if his side win promotion. \"I've already told the players that I'll do my 18th skydive naked if we win promotion this season,\" he said. \"They do that kind of thing in America, but I'd imagine it would be pretty cold up there.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Result of the weekend: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/luton\" title=\"\">Luton Town</a> remain 92nd in the Football League, but Saturday offered perhaps the brightest ray of hope they have had this season. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bury\" title=\"\">Bury</a> are riding high, but goals from Tom Craddock and Ian Roper gave the Hatters a confidence-boosting 2-1 at Gigg Lane.</p> <p>\u2022 Also scoring goals for fun is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chesterfield\" title=\"\">Chesterfield</a>'s Jamie Ward who added another wonderfully taken goal to the hat-trick he got against Aldershot last week. It takes his season tally to nine, and his recent spurt to seven goals in six games. If Jack Lester can also find his shooting boots (and he's shown some promise of doing just that in the past few weeks), the Spireites can start eyeing a promotion charge.</p>",
  "<p>In recent months, Robert Gates, the US secretary of defence, has received much praise for lowering the triumphalist rhetoric that marked the early phases of the so-called \"war on terror\". His emphasis on the need for <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2008/10/04/lessons_for_the_next_war/\">\"a sense of humility and an appreciation of limits\"</a> is sweet music to those who question the necessity of automatically using overpowering force to defend US national interests.</p> <p>But in one area Gates is not as humble or aware of limits as he aspires the military to be. In his frequent pronouncements that hard power can't do it all, he emphasises that what's needed is more <a href=\"http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=7059\">soft power</a>. But it turns out that he means massive doses of soft power as interpreted, packaged and distributed by the Pentagon and its contractors.</p> <p>True, in a <a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1199\">speech</a> last November, Gates did say another agency - the state department - should get more funding for its soft-power activities, which include public diplomacy programmes like its neglected educational and cultural exchanges.</p> <p>Little noticed in Gates's widely acclaimed remarks, however, was his statement: \"Don't get me wrong, I'll be asking for yet more money for defence next year.\" Part of the money Gates intends to spend, as the Washington Post reported recently, is for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204223_pf.html\">a $300m, three-year effort to \"engage and inspire\" Iraq's population</a> to support its government and US policies through a variety of programmes ranging from media products to entertainment (an additional $15m a year would be spent polling Iraqis).</p> <p>This is a huge amount by soft-power standards. The state department expects to spend just $5.6m on public diplomacy in Iraq in fiscal 2008. The defence department money is to be distributed among four private contractors, including the <a href=\"http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2005/12/21/bushprop_strikes_out_again.php\">Lincoln Group</a> which, per arrangements with the Pentagon, covertly paid Iraqi newspapers to print articles composed by the US military but published as straight news items.</p> <p>A few critical voices have been heard regarding Gates's hearts-and-mind initiative. <a href=\"http://webb.senate.gov/jim/\">Jim Webb</a>, the Democratic senator from Virginia, whose military and journalistic background makes him eminently qualified to speak about the use of soft power by the Pentagon, wrote in a letter to Gates: \"At a time when this country is facing such a grave economic crisis, and at a time when the government of Iraq now shows at least a $79bn surplus from recent oil revenues, in my view it makes little sense for the US department of defence to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to propagandise the Iraqi people.\"</p> <p>Public-diplomacy specialists have also been <a href=\"http://intermap.org/2008/10/11/senator-jim-webb-reads-blogs/\">put off</a> by Gates's indoctrination mission. As one noted scholar informed me by e-mail: \"Communication that is seen as propaganda does not attract and thus does not produce soft power.\" Critics point out that the defence department's funding is not transparent, which could result in its programmes losing credibility when target audiences find out where the money really comes from. This certainly turned out to be the case during the cold war, when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/23/reviews/000423.23joffet.html\">the CIA was exposed as the covert financial supporter of intellectual magazines</a> like Encounter that had been considered independent. Already, the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, Kazemi Qomi, <a href=\"http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8707240984\">has complained</a>: \"Four large media companies are contributing to the Pentagon's plan to provoke the Iraqi public opinion against the Islamic Republic and strain Tehran-Baghdad relations.\" Such <a href=\"http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8707240984\">\"anti-Iranian propaganda\"</a>, the Iranian news agency FARS says, is \"futile\".</p> <p>The Pentagon's costly soft-power initiative is not limited to foreign audiences, but <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204223_pf.html\">includes the US as well</a>. It specifies the need to \"communicate effectively with our strategic audiences (ie Iraqi, pan-Arabic, international and US audiences) to gain widespread acceptance of [US and Iraqi government] core themes and messages.\" According to <a href=\"http://abuaardvark.typepad.com/abuaardvark/2008/10/where-strategic.html\">Marc Lynch</a>, a specialist in the Middle East media, making \"American audiences \u2026 a key target for manipulation through the covert dissemination of propaganda messages should be seen as scandalous, subversive of democracy and illegal.\"</p> <p>Scandalous it indeed is, but such homeland targeting is part of the defence department's modus operandi, as the New York Times' revelations about the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/washington/20generals.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1\">military's use of domestic-media commentators</a> as propagandists for the Pentagon indicates (the activity is <a href=\"http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000002972699\">currently being investigated by the federal communications commission</a>). Nothing is worse than the misapplication of hard power, as Gates has rightly suggested. He seems unwilling to admit, however, that the same is true in the case of what the Pentagon interprets soft power to be.</p>",

  "<p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, today signalled a more punitive approach to prisons by attacking the \"criminal justice lobby\" for putting the needs of offenders before those of victims.</p> <p>In a speech on prison policy to the Royal Society of Arts, Straw said it was time to reclaim the \"unfashionable\" language of punishment and reform and make clear that the justice system is there to serve victims and the law-abiding majority first.</p> <p>Straw said that ditching jargon in favour of terms in plain English - offenders, sentencers, victims and communities - \"did not mean a return to the Victorian notions of dealing with crime, nor did it mean treating offenders inhumanely\".</p> <p>The government had a duty to reform as well as punish offenders, he said. This included providing the drug-treatment support and education programmes needed by many of those who ended up in prison either on drugs or without basic literacy skills.</p> <p>\"A just and civilised society is one where criminals both pay their debt to society and are given the chance to change,\" Straw said. \"Offenders must take their responsibility for their choice to commit a crime, they must be held to account for their actions, and challenged to make a better choice in the future.\"</p> <p>Straw's comments come at a time when prison chiefs are trying to cope with an inmate population of 83,383 in England and Wales. A recent fall in the use of short-term sentences by the courts means no prisoners are now being held in emergency police cells.</p> <p>Straw said the problem was that penal reformers had retreated into a \"fog of platitudes\" about offenders and had forgotten about victims.</p> <p>Just last month, Gordon Brown promised to appoint a victims' commissioner to give those who suffer from crime a stronger voice in government and in the community.</p> <p>Straw said that the \"criminal justice lobby\" needed to do more to put victims at the heart of their work and recognise that being a victim of crime is very traumatic.</p> <p>The justice minister said that phrases such as the \"criminogenic needs of offenders\" drove him nuts because the jargon created a barrier with the public and also because he profoundly disagreed with the idea that someone's amoral desire to steal should be seen as a \"need\", equivalent to those of victims.</p> <p>He said he had been \"appalled\" to read about a Halloween party, which took place in one prison, and vowed that no such event would ever take place again. \"I cannot imagine the offence which must have been caused to victims and their families, to see those images splashed across the paper,\" he said.</p> <p>Highlighting the modernisation of the prison system, such as ending the \"slopping out\" system, Straw said prisons nevertheless remained the harshest punishment the courts could hand down.</p> <p>Straw said a decent prison regime should not forget or ignore the fact that prisoners had committed offences, but should also give prisoners the chance to reform.</p> <p>The government has worked over the past 11 years on getting the balance \"right\" between the needs of the accused for reform and those of the victims and communities.</p> <p>The justice secretary said that custody ought to be reserved for the most violent, dangerous and prolific offenders, with a stronger focus on prevention and punishment in the community for the less serious offenders.</p> <p>And he defended the new \"titan\" prisons, which he insisted would not be \"large warehouses\".</p> <p>\"The truth of the matter is that it is much easier to find three sites for 2,500-place prison complexes than five times that number for 500-place prisons,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We have a duty to provide sufficient prison places, and to provide best value for money.\"</p> <p>Straw's comments on the use of language by criminal justice groups drew criticism from prison campaigners. </p> <p>Juliet Lyon , the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \"If you want to cut crime and prevent the next victim it's what you do, not what you say that counts,\" she said. </p> <p>The shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, said Straw's insistence on simple language did not detract from the fact that the government had failed on both \"punishment and reform\".</p> <p>\"Prisoners who serve less than half of their sentence are not being punished and there is no reform in overcrowded jails where reoffending rates have risen. </p> <p>\"Protesting about the interests of victims and posturing about punishment rings hollow from the minister who has just released over 30,000 prisoners early in a single year, and whose failure as home secretary to provide adequate jail capacity continues to disable the criminal justice system today.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats said victims did not benefit from prisons \"bursting at the seams\".</p> <p>Lib Dem justice spokesman David Howarth said: \"The government's obsession with punishment for its own sake, regardless of the consequences for future victims of crime, proves that ministers care more about getting a few easy headlines than they do about actually reducing crime. </p> <p>\"The best thing Jack Straw can do is to try to ensure there are fewer victims, which is achieved through catching criminals, not posturing on penalties.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's one false note in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/27/photography.photographyfeatures1\">Anton Corbijn</a>'s film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118797/control\">Control</a>. Superb and convincing as its portrayal of the life and death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/joydivision\">Joy Division</a> singer and lyricist Ian Curtis is, this monochrome vision of 1970s and early 1980s Manchester falls down when it comes to depicting Curtis at work at an employment exchange. It has a great visual joke - we see the punk Curtis approaching the dole office, think he's signing on, but then it turns out he works there - but I was struck that all the unemployed people in the film have special reasons, like illness, to make it hard for them to work. It's a historical error. You didn't need a reason to be on the dole in the age that produced Ian Curtis. This is the imagination of a boom time failing to remember what Britain was like just 20 years ago. And now we're going to be reminded.<br> The recent wave of Joy Division nostalgia is a strange irony given the brick wall the economy has hit. For it is a nostalgia for a time when art was more intense - and life less opulent. When Control came out last year it coincided with the <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/friezeartfair2007/0,,2186445,00.html\">Frieze art fair</a> and I remember thinking, how weird - all this romanticism about an artist who lived like Vincent van Gogh in contrast to the art of today that's all success, success, success. It's not just Curtis. In the 70s and 80s many of the same talents that now head straight for art galleries would have formed bands. Those bands were real cultural revolutionaries. Their art was soulful and radical. Is the great age of contemporary British culture the time when you could see <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=PF0OjrFIVWY\">Siouxie and the Banshees</a> in a dilapidated town hall, or the era when people gawp at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/oct/06/british.museum.statuephilia\">Marc Quinn's work in the British Museum</a>?<br> The moral seems unavoidable: in the cycle of boom and bust, it's bust that makes artists intense and original. But which do we honestly prefer? After all, in the boom times you can have it all. You can buy your Joy Division music and films and cry your tears of authenticity in the comfort of your home. Real life may create real art, but this is going to hurt.</p>",
  "<p>Speculation surrounding the health of Kim Jong-il intensified today after a Japanese TV station reported that a leading French brain surgeon had been sent to Pyongyang, after talks with the \"Dear Leader's\" eldest son.</p> <p>In a report by Fuji TV aired today, a man the broadcaster identified as Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, was seen visiting the neurological department of a Paris clinic, where he spent two hours with the unnamed surgeon.</p> <p>The report said he was \"believed to have met with a French brain surgeon, who later departed from Paris for Pyongyang under North Korean escort\".</p> <p>The portly figure, dressed in a dark pinstriped suit with a red tie, ignored questions about Kim Jong-il's health as he got into a waiting car, but managed a wave and a hint of a smile as he left, according to the station.</p> <p>The report then showed the surgeon arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport two days later, in a car belonging to the North Korean mission to Unesco.</p> <p>The doctor, whose face had been blurred by the network, confirmed he was flying to Beijing, a common transfer point for flights to Pyongyang, but would neither confirm nor deny whether he was flying to the North Korean capital.</p> <p>A spokeswoman at Fuji TV's Paris bureau declined to comment on Kim Jong-nam's reported visit. \"All of the information we have was included in the report,\" she said.</p> <p>Though accounts of political manoeuvering inside the secretive state are all but impossible to verify, few observers now believe the regime's recent claims that Kim Jong-il is in robust health.</p> <p>Rumours that he is seriously ill have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/korea\">circulating for weeks</a>, prompting speculation about a possible power struggle involving his three sons, his brother-in-law and senior members of the Korean Workers' party.</p> <p>US and South Korean officials said earlier this month that the 66-year-old, a former heavy smoker and drinker, had suffered a stroke and undergone brain surgery.</p>",
  "<p>Syria is making no effort to conceal its fury over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/syria-usa\">Sunday's US raid</a> across its border, targeting what was supposed to be a logistics base for foreign fighters crossing into Iraq. Perhaps what Damascus is calling an \"outrageous crime\" was a mini-version of the \"October surprise\" some had expected before the end of George Bush's presidency? In this case, it would be not so much an attempt to boost John McCain's flagging ratings but a final vengeful lunge against a country that others are now wooing but which still attracts profound hostility in Washington.</p> <p>In the event, if the details being reported from Damascus are correct \u2014 that special forces landed by helicopter five miles from the Iraqi border, attacked a construction site and killed eight people, including four children rather than an al-Qaida cell \u2014 it was hardly a successful outcome from a US point of view.</p> <p>Syria has always been hostile to the US-led invasion of Iraq and understandably nervous of the consequences of any spillover. The biggest effect has been that it has given shelter to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees. But in the first years after the war it also allowed Damascus airport and its long border with Iraq to be used by foreign jihadis heading to join the insurgency and fight the Americans and the Shia-led government in Baghdad.</p> <p>Yet the irony of yesterday's raid is that in recent months Syria had tightened control of the border, even winning public recognition from the former US commander, General David Petraeus. Analysts say that one reason for this tightening of control was alarming evidence of \"blowback\" from al-Qaida-type groups mounting attacks in Syria and Lebanon.</p> <p>Still, Syria has refused point-blank to renew intelligence cooperation with the Americans until they send an ambassador back to Damascus. US officials have made no secret of their frustration: so the unofficial message from Washington is that \"if the Syrians won't deal with this problem we'll do it ourselves\".</p> <p>It is possible \u2014 though unlikely \u2014 that the decision to carry out yesterday's raid into sovereign territory was taken by a US military commander without seeking clearance from Washington. Assuming it was cleared at the political level, it may have been intended as a broader warning to Syria at a time when the US and Israel say openly that they are trying to persuade President Bashar al-Assad to detach himself from his alliance with Iran and coax him into meaningful peace talks with the Jewish state.</p> <p>Indeed, the concept behind the raid appears to have borrowed from Israel, which last September bombed the alleged site of a nuclear reactor in northern Syria \u2014 even as it was contemplating pursuing peace talks with Damascus over the Golan Heights. This February's assassination of a key Hizbullah leader in the heart of Damascus was seen as another warning \"message\" to Assad.</p> <p>The US attack also underlines the widening gap between the Bush administration and Europe over the Middle East, as expectations mount for change under an Obama presidency. It came as Syria prepared to take another step in from the cold today with its foreign minister visiting London to hear praise for its newly conciliatory policies in Lebanon \u2014 and to be urged to distance itself from Iran. </p> <p>Walid al-Mualim is meeting David Miliband, the foreign secretary, for talks designed to encourage the country to play a more \"constructive\" role in the region. But the last-minute cancellation of a joint press conference suggests that Britain, at least, did not want to have to answer questions about the US raid.</p> <p>In recent months Syria has helped broker an end to Lebanon's prolonged political crisis, established diplomatic relations with it and held several rounds of indirect talks with Israel, with Turkey acting as broker. In July Assad was invited by Nicolas Sarkozy to an EU summit in Paris. </p> <p>But he has given no sign of agreeing to end Syria's long-standing relationship with Iran or to end its backing for Hizbullah and the Palestinian Islamists of Hamas: Assad may have to wait some time before being welcomed in Washington \u2014 by any president.</p>",
  "<p>During the 1990s, many one-time leftists in the west and elsewhere were drawn towards the idea that human rights could somehow fill the gap left by the decline in socialist politics. In the wake of the Bosnian bloodbath and the Rwandan genocide, that crystallised for some into support for unilateral humanitarian intervention and war.</p> <p>A decade on, the hopes that were invested in such delusions lie buried in the graveyards of Falluja and Kandahar, the ethnically cleansed Serb and Roma districts of Kosovo and the torture, kidnapping and internment jails run by the self-proclaimed liberators and human rights champions of the war on terror.</p> <p>As regular readers of comment is free will know, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/conorfoley\">Conor Foley</a> is a veteran aid worker who has seen from the inside how the human rights agenda has been conscripted to legitimise and underpin the US and British wars of occupation and domination of the past 10 years.</p> <p>Part working travelogue from almost every recent major conflict zone, part political journey and analysis, Foley's new book, <a href=\"http://www.versobooks.com/books/cdef/ef-titles/foley_c_the_thin_blue_line.shtml\">The Thin Blue Line: How Humanitarianism Went to War</a>, is an important and thoughtful contribution to understanding why western \"humanitarian interventions\" \u2013 from Somalia and Yugoslavia to Sierra Leone \u2013 have largely failed in their own terms and left such a dismal and unstable legacy.</p> <p>Foley is effective at deconstructing some of the mythology and deceit around these debacles \u2013 including the illegal Kosovo war of 1999, which paved the way for the aggression against Iraq, but is still seen as a successful humanitarian intervention by many who balk at the more nakedly imperial Iraqi and Afghan disasters. As Foley reminds us, the Nato bombing campaign was supposedly launched to stop war crimes and ethnic cleansing, grotesquely exaggerated in Anglo-American propaganda. But both increased dramatically as a result: it turned a \"simmering crisis into a full-scale humanitarian disaster\". And in the months after Nato troops took over in Kosovo, a thousand people were killed or disappeared as up to 250,000 Serbs and Roma were driven from their homes in the new western protectorate.</p> <p>But he is at his most insightful about the role played by the battalions of NGOs he has worked among, which follow the conquering armies like missionaries, often urging them on and providing the social infrastructure for the bloated occupation regimes that are then imposed on hostile lands. </p> <p>As Foley highlights, most non-governmental organisations in the humanitarian line of work are no longer really NGOs at all \u2013 they're increasingly sub-contracted GOs, which get the bulk of their funding from western governments with political strings attached. Foley describes returning to Afghanistan in 2004 to find that \"the humanitarian effort had become part of a wider counter-insurgency operation\". The then US secretary of state Colin Powell hailed the humanitarian NGOs as \"a force multiplier for us, such an important part of our combat team\". Against such a background, it's hardly surprising that aid workers come to be seen as targets by some of those fighting occupation.</p> <p>Steeped as he is in NGO-speak and thinking, Foley can often lapse into loaded terminology and assumptions: he repeatedly uses the term \"international community\", for example, when he clearly means the US and its allies. In the same vein, he largely accepts the reasons given by the western powers for their interventions at face value, along with, say, the legitimacy of occupied Afghanistan's fraudulent elections, in which political parties weren't even allowed on the ballot paper. And so keen is Foley to dissociate himself from \"anti-imperialists\" that he reserves some of his sharpest \u2013 and least sure-footed \u2013 attacks for a writer such as Naomi Klein, over her analysis in <a href=\"http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/the-book\">The Shock Doctrine</a> of disaster capitalism in post-tsunami Sri Lanka. </p> <p>But in a sense that only strengthens the force of his critique, coming as it does from someone immersed in the ideology and practice of the \"humanitarian community\" \u2013 who has learned from personal experience how calamitous invading other people's countries in the name of democracy and human rights has proved on the ground. When he describes the role played by western governments and NGOs in Sierra Leone and Liberia as a deeply resented \"recolonisation\", you know it's not meant as a rhetorical flourish.</p> <p>Far from making another Rwanda less likely, the liberal interventionist wars of the past decade have postponed the development of a genuine rules-based system of international protection by discrediting humanitarian intervention as a mechanism of imperial power enforcement applied only to weak and recalcitrant anti-western states. In the circumstances, Foley's conclusion that humanitarian NGOs should return to a policy of the strictest neutrality and broaden their focus from individual human rights to the wider inequalities of wealth and power that underlie conflict and humanitarian crises is surely only common sense.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Isle of Wight.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Owen Taylor (vocals), John Stevens (bass, backing vocals), Charlie Westropp (synths, guitar), Ben Athey (drums).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> As suburban indie-funkers go, The Operators are a bit lumpy and clumpy, like Hard Fi in hobnail boots. But when they hit a groove they can sound quite irresistible. They're heavy on the dance beats and the whoa-ohs, like Kaiser Chiefs seduced by Paul Epworth into pursuing an electroclash direction, or the Clash if they'd been around long enough to be influenced by Prince - one of their tracks, Just My Way, has the plodding power of Rock the Casbah. The singer is a bit of a strainer, though, struggling gruffly to keep up with the melody on Hells to the Bills, sounding like Chris Martin on disco biscuits, but there's no denying the infectious electronic pulse. The Operators use mainly traditional rock instrumentation to make the sort of noise normally achieved by sequencers and samplers, but with the grit and rough charm that only an indie band, even one high on funk, can provide.<br> The band, who formed in the Isle of Wight in 2006, describe themselves as \"a funky, dancey, geeky quartet\", one keen to blur the boundaries between band and DJ set. They're in love with Kings of Leon and Justice and in loathe with virtually all post-Libertines indie-guitar shamblers. They've been touring incessantly and have acquired a decent following as well as a reputation for \"stage presence, charisma and tight playing that produces epic live performances.\" Well, we saw them last week at the Notting Hill Arts Club and they weren't exactly overflowing with stage presence or charisma but they gelled as players and as a performing unit had energy to spare. They've got a bit of an indie X-Factor back-story, having come second at the Isle of Wight's Wight Noize Auditions, earning them a primetime slot on the second stage at the Isle of Wight festival. They're the first band to be managed by B-Unique (also the record label for Kaiser Chiefs and Primal Scream) and their debut single proper, B-Line (following the self-released What You See Is What I Sell EP from earlier this year), was a recent 6Music Single of the Week, while Radio 1 has predicted super soaraway success for them in 2009. Most prestigiously, the video for their single, which can be seen at www.iwcp.co.uk, was directed by Minta Townshend, daughter of the Who's Pete. Actually, no: even more prestigiously than that, they've been recording their debut album at Olympic Studios where the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin all \"cut\" tracks. Scratch that: for ultimate kudos, B-Line featured on Sky Sports, as background music during the highlights of the Doncaster v Southend game. Wait: for maximum no-holds-barred cachet, they recently had a pair of frilly white knickers thrown at them onstage, the only downside of this thrilling experience being that said undercrackers were so tatty and worn they looked as though they'd crawled up there through a forest of broken glass. The singer was so stunned he twatted himself in the face with his mic, resulting in a bloodied moustache. Still, free pants are free pants. <strong>The buzz: </strong>\"We can't shake the hooks out of our heads!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We can't shake the image of the shabby knickers.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make Tom Jones jealous.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Record a duet with Grace Jones.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> B-Line is released on November 3 by Distiller, with their debut album to follow early next year.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Hard Fi, Kaiser Chiefs, Das Pop, the Clash.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theoperatorsrock\">www.myspace.com/theoperatorsrock</a><br> Tomorrow's new band: The Tenants Supermen.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-liberal24-2008oct24,0,1269386.story\">accuses Barack Obama</a> of wanting \"European style socialism\" in the US. If only. <br> Apart from the irony that the Bush administration is effectively nationalising the commanding heights of the economy in the course of the current economic crisis, one would have thought that this is - shall we say to be kind - an inappropriate time for a candidate to sing songs of praise to capitalism red in tooth and claw. Gore Vidal and many others have quipped over the years that the US practices free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich, so what we are seeing now is not really a fundamental change in approach. Money in rich torrents for the banks and finance houses, and thin gruel for those about to be made homeless is on a par with food stamps that passed into legislation as a subsidy to US agriculture.  However, despite a natural tendency to disbelieve anything that McCain says in McCarthy-ite mode, it is indeed a truth that should be universally acknowledged that western Europe, even with the Thatcherite and Blairite hiccups, is indeed social democratic in its outlook. At the end of the second world war George Orwell predicted that western Europe was the most likely to succeed in establishing some form of democratic socialism, and he was right. Since 1950, western Europe has offered its citizens the highest combined standards of human, civil and social rights in world history. The west is red! It may have been Franklin Delano Roosevelt who coined the slogan about the four freedoms, from fear and want, and of belief and speech, but Europe put them into effect while the US remained bogged down in 19th century laissez-faire.  However, McCain's attempt to conflate Obama with European socialism and both with Soviet-style communism is as self evidently absurd as his conflation of Joe the Plumber's fiscal fate with Exxon-Mobil's. Even European conservative parties are far to the left of Obama in their professed conviction that some things are too important to leave to free markets, that the pursuit of untrammeled greed alone will not benefit society as a whole, and that societies have a collective responsibility to ensure the welfare of their citizens. Of course, European social-democracy is nothing like the Leninoid totalitarianisms that some on the left still see as the litmus test for socialism. My father, an eccentrically unrepentant fan of Stalin to his deathbed, had it right \"that Uncle Joe understood the dictatorship of the proletariat \u2013 the workers need a bayonet up their arse\". The Georgian shared this view with American free-marketers who believe that workers will only be productive when forced to work for less money by the threatened lash of unemployment. But we are at the end of a 60-year-old real-time experiment in the relative success of American laissez-faire and European social democracy. In 1945 Europeans were smaller and less healthy than the Americans. Some 60 years of European socialism later, the Dutch, for example are <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/popular/ci_6383832\">two inches taller</a> than Americans. <a href=\"http://atlanticreview.org/archives/661-Europeans-are-taller-than-Americans.html\">Europeans can expect</a> longer life spans, and much less infant mortality than their erstwhile liberators, who are cursed with a free market health system that leaves 45 million people uninsured, and is the least efficient in the industrialised world. Not coincidentally, it is the most expensive \u2013 and the most profitable. <br> Freedom from fear, as Roosevelt advocated in 1945, was implemented to a much larger degree in Europe. Mothers can take serious, guaranteed, paid maternity leave, compared with Clinton's big step forward \u2013 unpaid family leave. Those socialist Europeans are guaranteed sick pay for months, years, on end and guaranteed vacation time, which they can take without fear of retribution. And the enterprises in which they work are prospering and solvent on the basis that employees deserve some measure of the prosperity and security that McCain assumes only CEOs need to motivate them. If Obama and the Democrats were socialists, then Americans could enjoy the nearly universal health care of western Europe, not just in the sense of hospitals and doctors, but the health of the population \u2013 they would live longer for example <a href=\"http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa042000b.htm\">instead of being 42nd in the world longevity league</a>, they would have something higher than the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/parenting/05/08/mothers.index/\">29th place in the world infant mortality tables</a>.<br> American workers, who have been on an effective pay freeze since Ronald Reagan took office, could enjoy the steadily rising incomes of their European counterparts. Who knows, maybe the murder rate would drop to civilised world standards and the \"socialist\" US could relinquish its <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/23/america/23prison.php\">positions at the top of the world</a> incarcerations and executions leagues.<br> Even justice suffers. At the time of the first OJ Simpson trial, I remember asking an American defence attorney which courts he would prefer, and he answered immediately, \"if I were rich and guilty, I'd want to be tried here. If I were poor and innocent \u2013 I'd prefer Europe\". There have been steps backward as European governments persuaded themselves that Washington was showing the way economically. However, one can only hope that Europeans, particularly social democrats, can surely see further than the coast of Alaska and deduce that the main lesson from McCain's United States are negative ones. It is time to put the clock forward in Europe from where it stopped under the baneful influence of Reagan, Thatcher and Blair.</p>",

  "<p>With all the hype surrounding the <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/18174/jude-law-to-star-in-donmars-hamlet\">two Hamlets</a> currently <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2824445/David-Tennant-a-sell-out-in-West-End-Hamlet.html\">on their way</a> to the West End, I was cruelly reminded by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becket_(film)\">film version of Jean Anouilh's Becket </a>what great actors Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton are and were respectively. I am unlucky not have been around to witness either of them in their heyday. Burton played the role at the Old Vic in 1953, directed by John Gielgud, while O'Toole was at the National directed by Laurence Olivier in 1963. These two <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare\">Hamlets</a> must surely have been the stuff of theatrical dreams. </p> <p>This led me to the revelation that perhaps my generation has been short-changed in the type of actor who has an electricity and sense of danger that cannot be taught at drama school. While <a href=\"http://www.david-tennant.com/\">David Tennant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/jude_law_biog.html\">Jude Law</a> have both have proved themselves fine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre\">stage</a> actors, I cannot describe either as truly dangerous - a quality that Burton and O'Toole personified.<br> Who are the Burtons and O'Tooles of today, the actors that have it all? There's no doubt that they, along with <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2361801.stm\">Richard Harris</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oliverreed.org/\">Oliver Reed</a>, led far from healthy lifestyles. Booze and brawling was the norm the second they stepped off the stage. But this sense of real-life danger did permeate their acting, and their performances were more watchable because of it. Both of them, when asked why they drank so much, gave eerily similar answers. Burton said he drank to \"burn up the flatness, the stale, empty dull deadness that one feels when one goes off stage\" while O'Toole said more succinctly that drinking just \"diminishes the pain\", before adding cheekily that he enjoyed \"going out for a drink in Paris and waking up in Corsica\". While we undeniably have many excellent actors, I sometimes long to see less in the way of technical brilliance, and something more instinctive and incendiary.<br> There are a couple of actors who perhaps could take up the mantle, but they seem to gravitate towards film. One of my voice tutors at drama school told me that <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000358/bio\">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> always gave the impression that he \"would make a very dangerous actor\". He's gone on to use that quality to make him one of the most in-demand film actors in the world, but I would love to see him in a theatre. In 1989, he was playing Hamlet at the National Theatre when he dramatically collapsed and left the stage mid-performance. Will someone please convince this man to return to the stage? Another actor who would be fantastic on stage is <a href=\"http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/gary_oldman_biog.html\">Gary Oldman</a>, who often appeared at the Royal Court in the 1980s, but as far as I know hasn't done any Shakespeare. He would make a great Iago. <br> Apart from that, I genuinely can't think of anyone else who can electrify as oppose to merely impress. Has acting itself changed, or was this golden generation a one-off, a product of the postwar generation who lived life to a degree that my cappuccino-drinking, scarf-tossing acting peers and I cannot fathom? Or am I asking too much?</p>",

There, in excited conversation, they learned the world was about to end, that the events taking place in their time were all set forth in the Bible, and that they should prepare for the great battle of Armageddon and the second coming of Christ. As they talked, a young man might sit out on the porch cradling an automatic rifle. If the Jewish Communists of the Zionist Occupied Government (ie the US federal government) arrived, leading their rank and file troops of black and brown people, he would be ready for them.</p> <p>In the 1980s, I traveled through the American midwest, north-west, and south, covering the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and the rise of other radical rightwing white supremacist groups. Their imaginations were fired by the Bible's <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/108/66/13.html\">book of Revelations</a>. The farm depression, foreclosures, penny auctions, bank takeovers, were evidence aplenty to many people that the bank - with the Jews behind them and people of color doing their bidding - were on the move. They had already taken control of the government. Soon, the 82nd Airborne would arrive to take over, depriving \"sovereign\" white men of their land, their rights, their freedom. And behind it all was the Beast, the anti-Christ who took various forms, from Fidel Castro to just about any leader of the East bloc. They believed that final showdown was coming soon, and they wanted to be ready.</p> <p>This was true American subculture, bringing together longstanding strains of racism and nativism with a religion known as Christian Identity and with a populist distrust of national government - all of them fueled by economic despair. Largely ignored in the history books, dismissed by the politicians, written off by the FBI as an aberrant fringe, the movement lost momentum - swallowed up in part by the onset of Christian fundamentalism, and muffled in the anti-government policies of the conservative Republican government.</p> <p>But it never completely died. And as I travelled through this same terrain last week, I hear familiar thinly encoded messages letting me know that this kind of thinking still prevails among some people here in the heartland, perhaps gaining new fuel from the apocalyptic financial meltdown. Once again there is talk of the Beast, or of the End Times and the final battle. And all of it is now focused on the candidacy of Barack Obama. Today, we continue our travels up through Ohio towards Cleveland, and after that into Pennsylvania, where the Aryan nations unsuccessfully sought to set up a compound. West Virginia is close by, as is western Maryland, both redoubts of the far right. And here we're sure to hear more of it.</p>",
  "<p>In these days of giant bank bail-outs and financial calamity involving sums in the billions, 1,000 seems like a small number. Except it is the average number of people killed by small arms every day, and to me that number is devastating. Many of these deaths happen because armed weapons are too easy to buy and sell. </p> <p>There are at least 640m firearms in existence in the world today and up to 14bn bullets are manufactured every year, the vast majority of which are shipped across borders and oceans with practically no regulation. </p> <p>There is a human side to these dry numbers. In my seven years of campaigning for greater arms control I've met many families whose loved ones have been killed by small arms. </p> <p>Travelling with <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\">Oxfam</a> to South Africa and northern Uganda, two places both suffering the effects of an unregulated arms trade, I met children who had been raped at gunpoint or seen their parents shot. In Uganda over 25,000 children were kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to become child soldiers. There were camps full of youngsters who have escaped from the rebels, many too traumatised to talk about their experiences. </p> <p>There is hope, however. This month the <a href=\"http://www.iansa.org/un/index.htm\">UN</a> holds a crucial vote on an arms trade treaty which would finally control the flow of weapons around the globe. </p> <p>If an effective treaty is agreed then for the first time arms exporters, and countries who transfer arms to third parties, would be legally required to examine whether the weapons would be used for human rights abuses. The treaty would also force exporters to stop arms transfers that might undermine development. </p> <p>So far the idea of an arms trade treaty has been well-received at the UN. In <a href=\"http://www.controlarms.org/en/media/2006/21-june-2006-un-world-conference-on-small-arms-and\">2006</a> a majority of governments voted to start work on the treaty, and since then they have been discussing <a href=\"http://www.armstradetreaty.com/att/howwould.php\">how a treaty could work</a>. </p> <p>Now it is a make-or-break moment.

When an audience watches dance, each individual has to come to their own understanding of the piece, depending on their own cultural and emotional experiences and interpretative lens. I began to work with a choreographer, two dancers and an actor, looking for ways in which a simple human narrative could offer a specific emotional perspective from which to watch dance. </p> <p>When we started the rehearsal process, we were uncertain about how the piece would form itself. It was completely unwritten, both in movement and in text. Throughout the process, we kept coming back to one particular story, which had seared itself on the imagination of the entire team. It was a true story that explored the extremes of human emotions. It battled with the big questions of humanity: how to love well, how to live well and how to face death.</p> <p>The theme of memory was central to this story and also to the development of the piece. Jenny Worton, who wrote the text, was fascinated with the way in which our memories evolve and transform depending on the emotions connected to that event. A central strand of the work depicts a memory half remembered and repeated, which changes in both detail and tone depending on how the speaker is feeling. This idea has, in turn, been fed into the movement; the choreographer, Anna Williams, has used repeated phrases and structures, which evolve in tempo, spacing and intensity as the piece develops.</p> <p>Working closely with the designer, lighting designer and sound designer has allowed a range of theatrical languages to jostle alongside each other as fundamental features of the production. We have used sound and light to zoom in and out of the action, and to play with perspective and focus. Some sections of the piece are created through sound, light and movement; in other places, text takes prominence.</p> <p>Making the work in our tiny space at the Gate theatre created physical boundaries that were, in fact, a useful creative stimulus for the team. The dancers could barely stand side by side with their arms spread without hitting a wall \u2013 as a result, the movement material often feels like a tightly woven spring. </p> <p>It has been brilliant finding ways to develop the work for its transfer to the Lillian Baylis Studio at Sadler's Wells, where the stage is almost three times as wide as the Gate's. We have had to evolve the design carefully in order to retain the intimacy of the original, but it has also created moments of real freedom: the dancers can break out of their spatial confines with abandon.</p>",
  "<p>China started its current economic reform from a small village called Xiaogang in eastern Anhui province in 1978. Eighteen farmers risked their lives to sign a secret agreement, which divided communally-owned farmland into individual pieces.</p> <p>Now, after 30 years of high-speed growth, China needs to start a new round of reforms from where it began: the rural land. China's economic engine has gradually lost momentum and the nation needs new initiatives to maintain its economic growth. The widening rural-urban <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/china\">income gap</a> has also pushed the ruling communist party to map out new efforts, to win accountability among the 700 million farmers.</p> <p>This is the background to China's latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/china\">rural land reform</a> approved on October 12 at <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081020/ap_on_re_as/as_china_communists_1\">a meeting</a> of the party's policy-setting central committee, but announced one week after the meeting. There's no official explanation on the one-week lag, but analysts generally believe that it reflects disagreement within the party on the new reform.</p> <p>Chinese farmers currently have 30-year limited leases to use their land, while the land belongs to the state. Although the new policy stops short of outright privatisation, it extends the farmers' land leases to 70 years and allows them to subcontract, sublease, exchange and swap their land lease.</p> <p>Rural land transfer and lease have become common in recent years. The new policy will encourage more farmers to transfer their land, thus creating larger, more efficient farms with the increased productivity China's agricultural sector needs. It protects the farmers' interests by establishing transparent land transfer market systems. In recent years, many social conflicts originated in the rural areas while local officials abused their power to transfer rural land to property developers and paid little compensation to the farmers.</p> <p>The effects of the land reform will be widely felt. It will push massive rural land into the market transactions, creating a business worth trillions. Millions of farmers will move to cities after leasing or transferring their land. Cities will have to be enlarged even further while the educational and medical facilities will have to be expanded. The speeding-up of urbanisation would help to sustain China economic growth.</p> <p>The land reform will also have important political implications. It is possibly one of the most important policy changes in the 59-year history of the People's Republic of China, a horn that signals the start of a new round of overall reforms. Farmers and workers used to be the two pillars of the communist party. Their support made it possible for the party to win a civil war in 1945-49 and establish the current administration. However, as the country moved forward towards market-oriented reforms, they have become the groups who lost most.</p> <p>Some of the policies the party adopted, including the <a href=\"http://daily.iflove.com/bizchina///2007-08/08/content_6016654.htm\">Revitalisation of the North-east Industrial Bases</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/chinagate/west.html\">West Development</a>, were intended to increase the workers' social benefits and narrow the wealth gap among social classes. However, those measures didn't work as well as expected. In the cities, residents complain about rising living costs and keep questioning the accountability of the ruling party. That's why, in spite of the fierce resistance from entrepreneurs, the new labour law was introduced early this year. The communist party is trying to win back the support of workers.</p> <p>The party's effort is now focusing on gaining the support from farmers as their huge population means they are a determining factor in the country's stability. It is a challenging task. Whether enough facilities and jobs can be created for those moving to the cities remains a big question. There is a real danger that those farmers who have sold their land will become jobless, possibly homeless, migrants, threatening social stability and the ruling of the communist party.</p> <p>If the rural reform is successful, the next major reform on the horizon would be the long-awaited political reform. Don't hold your breath though.</p>",
  "<h2>Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin - The Skate (c1725-1726), Soap Bubbles (c1733-1734)</h2> <p>Time stills and the world goes quiet when you look at Chardin's closely observed scenes and objects. His frequent depictions of people deeply absorbed in what they are doing \u2014 making a house of cards, pouring tea, blowing soap bubbles \u2014 is a metaphor for the patient work of painting a picture. In relaxing and slowing down to look at his humble scenes, you too join a triangle of contemplative attentiveness. A belief in the value of mental discipline drives this great artist of the 18th century Enlightenment.

The response from Ho Ho Ying \u2014 founder of Singapore's Modern Art Society \u2014 is reproduced in pencil on four large panels and sets out a discourse about the precarious nature of Singapore's art history.

His masterpiece, the Wind Comb, features three giant steel grappling hooks jutting from the cliffs at San Sebastian. It's unlikely that David Seaman will repeat this feat.

You wonder why the museum allows such insect behaviour but it's a painted fly on a painted frame; it has been settled there since the middle ages. (JJ)</p> <h2>Frederic Edwin Church -Twilight in the Wilderness (1860)</h2> <p>The Connecticut-born Church was one of the richest and most famous American artists of the 19th century, producing spectacular, vividly coloured<br>landscapes. Arguably, this one is too lurid with its huge red, purple and blue sky, but it undoubtedly has wow factor: it almost knocks you out. And it also suggests there is change in the air. The civil war was looming; this is America at a crossroads. (MB)</p> <h2>Pieter Claesz - Still Life with Stoneware Jug, Wine Glass, Herring, and Bread (1642)</h2> <p>The ruffled metallic skin of the fish, the silver sheen of the plate it rests on, the light reflecting magically in a huge tinted wine glass and the musty liquid within \u2014 this is a painting about surfaces. With Dutch still life painting, what you see is what you get. (JJ)</p> <h2>Harry Clarke - The Eve of St Agnes (1924)</h2> <p>Inspired by the medieval stained glass of Chartres, the Dublin artist spent years perfecting the intense jewel colours of his own glass, enriched with etching and engraving. Many churches in Britain and Ireland have Clarke windows, but this secular piece, his mesmerising illustration of the Keats poem, is perhaps his masterpiece. His early death was blamed on overwork and the chemicals used in glass- making. (MK)</p> <h2>Claude - Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba (1648), <br>Landscape with Aeneas at Delos (1672)</h2> <p>Claude was a consummate landscape painter, his work hugely important to later artists, notably Turner. Many of his works seem to convey not only space but also time. In Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba a sense of temporality seems almost contained within the perspective, its background receding in layers like an old-fashioned theatre set. Points of departure are of interest to him; and in Landscape with Aeneas at Delos, there is a sense of the hero hovering between destinations \u2014 he is between his native city of Troy and his future home of Italy, accompanied by his soon-to- die father and his young son Anchises. (CH)</p> <h2>John Constable - Brighton Beach (1824), A Study for The Leaping Horse (1824-1825)</h2> <p>Forget the faded, badly reproduced version of Constable above your grandma's mantelpiece. This painter was no scenic picturesque faker. Observe, in these two astounding oil sketches, the way only he could unearth the rainbow tones in the seaside spume and countryside muck. It's as if he conjures almost tactile cross-associations between the stickiness of the oil paint and the quagmire that the horse is heaping from. The trees glisten with tics and flecks of lead white. And Brighton beach has never since looked so bracing. (RC)</p> <h2>Lovis Corinth - Death and the Artist (1921)</h2> <p>Here's the expressionist artist's lot. Corinth liked a drink or two and in this late self-portrait he catches himself in the mirror with the ravages of the bottle warping his face earthwards as a death's-head peeps malevolently from behind his shoulder. (RC)</p> <h2>Joseph Cornell - Taglioni's Jewel Casket (1940)</h2> <p>Artistic innovations often result from ludicrously simple shifts of convention. Cornell's innovation was the use of the box as a container of cryptic oddments, evoking reveries through the assemblage of created treasures and collected junk. Here, a velvet-lined box holds a glass necklace and 12 glass ice cubes alongside a legend recounting the 1835 plight of one Marie Taglioni, a famous ballerina, who, to save her jewellery from being stolen by a Russian highwayman, was made to dance upon a panther's skin spread over the snow and beneath the stars. (RC)</p> <h2>Correggio - Jupiter and Io (early 1530s)</h2> <p>A woman is embraced by a cloud \u2014 something you don't see every day \u2014 but the real surprise is Correggio's painterly triumph. Renaissance artists loved the challenge of the ancient Roman poet Ovid's tales of the loves of Jupiter, king of the gods, who took various forms to seduce nymphs \u2014 none stranger than that of a cloud. Correggio pictures a dark fluffy rain cloud seeping into the woods where Io sits naked; a green-grey vaporous paw slides around her waist as a face resolves out of the haze to kiss her. (JJ)</p> <h2>Piero di Cosimo - A Satyr Mourning Over a Nymph (c1495), The Forest Fire (c1505)</h2> <p>Enigmatic, romantic, deeply strange: these are paintings to make the imagination dance. In A Satyr Mourning Over a Nymph the dead nymph's head is cradled by her companion, while a dog sits sadly at her feet; in the background, more dogs footle around an otherwise deserted shore. In The Forest Fire, which perhaps illustrates themes in Lucretius's poem On the Nature of Things, animals and birds \u2014 woodcock, goldfinch, crane \u2014 take fright as the undergrowth bursts into flames; some of these animals are fantastical, with human faces staring out of pigs' bodies. (CH)</p> <h2>S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n - Still Life with Poultry, Vegetables and Fruit (1602)</h2> <p>Seven apples hang suspended from seven strings in the shape of a hexagon. Two songbirds hang dead, and two partridges. A great curving bunch of celery, some phallic carrots and three lemons add to the mystery. More dead birds are displayed on a stick propped against the stone frame that holds all these objects poised on the edge of a deep darkness. (JJ)</p> <h2>John Sell Cotman - Greta Bridge (c1807)</h2> <p>Cotman's approach to landscape could hardly be more temperamentally different from that of his contemporary Turner. While Turner revelled in nature's tendency to drench his vulnerability in waves of light, Cotman's special penchant was for those moments when the fleeting atmosphere appears transfixed. (RC)</p> <h2>Gustave Courbet - A Burial at Ornans (1849-1850), The Peasants of Flagey Returning from the Fair (1850-1855), The Painter's Studio: A Real Allegory (1855), Les Puits Noir (1860-1865), Woman with a Parrot (1865-1866), The Origin of the World (1866), The Trout (1872)</h2> <p>The immemorial French countryside seems to parade its ghosts before us in Courbet's great painting The Peasants of Flagey, with its man in a tall hat sitting like a stone monument holding the reins of a cart; it is a scene whose geological weight makes you realise that Courbet, prophet of Realism, is among other things the forerunner of C\u00e9zanne. Strength, solitude (in a family<br>or a crowd), enduring truths and silent rage make this master of craggy authority a tremendously powerful painter. If any one person invented modern art, it was Courbet. He called it Realism, capitalised, and in his self-portrait The Painter's Studio he depicts himself as a political as well as aesthetic hero, saving the working class of France by painting real life as it really looks. His sensational shocking masterpiece A Burial at Ornans rubs your nose in the blunt truth of death. At its centre is a hole, a nothingness that Courbet returns to again and again. Some of his most haunting paintings are landscapes in his native Jura region that force you to look into the lightless depths of cave mouths. The rough texture of Courbet's art, the dry broken brushwork that makes the faces of his country people so harsh and authentic, is far from being only a visual trait. His awkwardness extends to sexuality, which he acknowledged with a scandalous insistence on \"truth\" \u2014 his painting of a nude that looks right between her thighs is called The Origin of the World. And yet, with his sensationalism and radical courage \u2014 he painted his portrait of a hooked fish, The Trout, in exile in Switzerland after joining the Paris Commune \u2014 he is ultimately a great artist of the countryside. His stony-faced peasants and small town types contain in their impassive looks the silence of centuries. (JJ)</p> <h2>Lucas Cranach the Elder - Lamentation Beneath the Cross (1503)</h2> <p>The bodies of the three men nailed to crosses are broken, tortured and ugly: Cranach reveals the horrific antithesis of the beautiful Renaissance nude, the body wrecked and dying, ruinous prison of the soul. (JJ)</p> <h2>Carlo Crivelli - The Annunciation (1486)</h2> <p>Prior to a major clean-up, Crivelli's Annunciation was just another yellowing panel by a minor 15th century master. Afterwards its super-saturated colours, computer-game perspective and startling image of the Virgin zapped by a heavenly laser revealed it to be the missing link between the High Renaissance and outer space.

  "<h2>Thomas Gainsborough - Mr and Mrs Andrews (c1750), Mary Countess Howe (c1764), Mrs Robinson, 'Perdita' (1781)</h2> <p>The wet sky and dew-chilled fields of the English landscape, and the forbidding faces of the people who own it, have never been better caught than by Gainsborough in his early, iconic painting Mr and Mrs Andrews, yet this is just the beginning of him. Gainsborough is both a triumph and indictment of Britain's art history. The empirical eye that sees Mr and Mrs Andrews so clearly is one of painting's finest \u2014 yet why could the culture he lived in not release it to the imaginative ambition of a Watteau or Goya? </p> <p>There are abundant compensations in his brilliant career as a portraitist. His paintings, after he set up in Bath then London, become ever grander and more willowy, and his love of women lives on in his fairtytale visions of famous society beauties.(JJ)</p> <h2>Anton\u00ed Gaud\u00ed - Casa Batll\u00f3 (1904-1906)</h2> <p>This Catalan art nouveau architect sculpts forms as if his buildings were models in mud; the freedom of his creativity makes him a great modern artist as much as an architect. His genius reaches its zenith in this house. (JJ)</p> <h2>Paul Gauguin - The Meal (1891), Where Have We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (1897), Nevermore (1897)</h2> <p>A woman lies thinking, nude on a green bed with a bright yellow pillow, while two robed figures talk outside her painted house. What's troubling her \u2014 the painting's title, Nevermore, suggests \u2014 is the big tropical bird that here takes the place of the sinister raven in Edgar Allan Poe's poem. But what's arresting about this majestic painting is Gauguin's evocation of a Tahitian woman's inner life with a sensitivity that contradicts both the clich\u00e9 image of this painter as a bully who oppressed his friend van Gogh, and the prejudice that European modernists who went in search of the \"primitive\" a century ago were all callow racists. Gauguin's gravely beautiful paintings of Pacific island life are monuments to a culture that he saw missionaries and the colonial economy eroding. They abound in documents of the art, history and people that the modern world is casually destroying before his eyes. (JJ)</p> <h2>Artemisia Gentileschi - Judith and her Maidservant (1613-1614), Judith and Holofernes (c1614-1620), Judith and Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes (c1625), Judith and Holofernes (1625-1630), Self-Portrait as Allegory of Painting (1630s)</h2> <p>In the great Self-Portrait she painted in Britain while working for Charles I, this tremendously powerful artist depicts herself reaching physically forward into space as if painting is an epic elemental battle. It's one of the most significant works in the history of artistic self-portraiture; her heroic vision of the artist's task is comparable to Michelangelo's in a poem he wrote about the physical agony of painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling.</p> <p>Artemisia Gentileschi was famous in her lifetime and rediscovered in the 20th century as a feminist icon. This rediscovery is more than justified, but when a case for an artist is made on grounds that are not aesthetic, there is sometimes a carping response from those who will see the fame as \"special pleading\". </p> <p>So let's make a couple of things clear. Artemisia Gentileschi is a much more exciting artist than her father, Orazio. His paintings \u2014 such as Joseph and Potiphar's Wife in the Royal Collection \u2014 have a smoothness to their realism that is a bit cloying and prematurely Victorian. She is also far more vital than the Baroque pietists so overpraised in the last half-century. She is the greatest of the Italians who took up Caravaggio's bloodstained brush.</p> <p>Those are the purely aesthetic reasons to admire her. But her art is inseparable from her life. When she was young in the highly disreputable milieu of the Caravaggisti in Rome, Artemisia Gentileschi was raped by an artist. There was a court case, during which she maintained her testimony under torture, and the perpetrator was found guilty. Afterwards she kept coming back to the theme of Judith, the Biblical hero who visited the Israelites' enemy Holofernes in his tent and cut his head off. Gentileschi's versions of this story passionately side with the women in it \u2014 she stresses the role of Judith's servant who went with her, which turns this into a communal act \u2014 and the massive physical difficulty of cutting a man's head off. She pays homage, obviously, to Caravaggio's terrifying version of this story but the monumental limbs and powerful bodies and faces of the two women in the 1625-1630 picture, with the servant holding the fully conscious Holofernes down while Judith saws through his neck, make it perversely noble. Just as Caravaggio played ambiguously on the relationship between life and art, Gentileschi in these paintings is alluding to, dramatising, and recording her life's trials. (JJ)</p> <h2>Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault - The Raft of the Medusa (1819)</h2> <p>A life's work is condensed in this stupendous vision of despair, for which G\u00e9ricault studied the dead and the living in a titanic \u2014 and darkly triumphant \u2014 effort to create a modern history painting. The last survivors of a notorious case of abandonment at sea desperately try to catch the attention of a ship on the horizon. Corpses, madness, intimations of cannibalism and a terrible void at the heart of the massed bodies make their suffering an allegory of a godless, abandoned world. (JJ)</p> <h2>Marcus Gheeraerts II - Portrait of Captain Thomas Lee (1594)</h2> <p>Thomas Lee, described by one historian as a \"soldier, marauder, squatter, debtor, poseur, pamphleteer, mediator, conspirator and jailbird\", was an English soldier in Ulster in the reign of Elizabeth I. He is depicted here as an Irish \"kerne\" or footsoldier \u2014 barelegged, exotic and sexy. (CH)</p> <h2>Alberto Giacometti - The Palace at 4.00am (1932-1933), Portrait of Jean Genet (1954-1955)</h2> <p>Giacometti's portrait of Jean Genet is like a prison cell. This man, whose writing saved him from the criminal early life he describes in A Thief's Journal, is right back inside, trapped in a flat brown room like a cell \u2014 or a tomb. In Giacometti's mature work after the second world war the human figure is both heroic and attenuated \u2014 a thin charred husk of courage and freedom resisting, just, the powers of destruction. This desperate humanism contrasts at first sight with his dreamlike early surrealist objects, yet through all his life he searches for the primitive essence of art. (JJ)</p> <h2>Gilbert and George - Shitty Naked Human World (1994)</h2> <p>Their own naked bodies, semen, giant turds, skinheads, Muslim boys, religious imagery: nothing seems off-limits for these provocateurs, who have worked together as \"living sculptures\" since they met at art school in the 1960s, and whose most characteristic work is largescale, gridded photographic montages. (CH)</p> <h2>Eric Gill - North, South, East Winds (c1927)</h2> <p>Gill's convoluted life and beliefs \u2014 his version of Catholicism did not prohibit him from abusing his children, or dogs, but he strongly disapproved of trousers \u2014 cannot eclipse the beauty of his elegant line as sculptor, draughtsman, letter cutter or font designer. His work remains on, and in, many public buildings, and his nobly plain Gill Sans font still abounds in books, posters and advertising. London is particularly rich in his public sculpture: millions of commuters shuffling to or from work forget to look up, and miss the sculpture gallery on the facade of the 1920s London Electric Railway Company, built over St James's Park tube station. Alongside works by Jacob Epstein and Henry Moore, Gill's North, East and South Winds ripple, muscle and movement frozen in stone. (MK)</p> <h2>Giorgione - The Old Woman (c1506-1510), The Tempest (c1505), Laura (1506), Sleeping Venus (Giorgione/Titian) (c1510)</h2> <p>Mystery and ambiguity haunt the paintings of Giorgone. What is going on in the moody environment of The Tempest, for instance? At the left, a man rests on a staff; at the right, a semi-naked woman cradles a child. In the background, the sky is torn in two by a lightning crack and the landscape is dotted with curious architecture including a broken pillar. The woman in The Tempest also probably sat for his lovely, but equally mysterious \"Laura\" \u2014 presumed to be so called because she is crowned with laurels. His unusual, touching old woman carries a salutary motto pointing to the passage of time; the Sleeping Woman in a Landscape, by contrast, probably passed on to his young associate Titian to complete after his death, is all sensuality (and directly inspired Manet's Olympia). These are dreamlike paintings, on which<br>the imagination can play at will. (CH)</p> <h2>Giotto - The Baptism of Christ (1305-1306), The Entry into Jerusalem (1305-1306), The Capture of Christ (1305-1306), The Lamentation (1305-1306), The Crucifixion (1305-1306), Maest\u00e0 (c1310), The Funeral of Saint Francis (1320s)</h2> <p>Judas enfolds Christ in a yellow cape like a demon's wings, as he puts his arms on the taller man's shoulders and turns his half-shaven face up to kiss him on the lips. Christ pulls back slightly, the anger of a man struggling with the compassion of a god \u2014 and looks directly into the eyes of his betrayer with a look that says: I know.</p> <p>Giotto is a man of the middle ages whose art has a human dramatic intensity no modern has ever improved upon. Leonardo da Vinci looked up to him, and so does the film director Martin Scorsese, who once named Giotto's fresco cycle in the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua, where this scene of The Capture of Christ is to be found, as his favourite work of art. And in truth, the masculinity of Christ, his struggle with his rage, the look he gives Judas and the violence as Peter takes out his dagger to fight the soldiers with their pikes and torches is like a shattering moment of cinema.</p> <p>Giotto's frescoes in Padua, set against a deep blue that soothes their passion, abound in human drama \u2014 as Christ dies on the cross an angel tears its robes apart in howling grief like people Giotto must have seen who had lost a child or brother in the brutal feuds that gripped his city, Florence. Perhaps his most sublime picture of emotion is the scene in Santa Croce, Florence, of Franciscan friars mourning their leader, their gestures so dignified and eloquent. Giotto is, quite simply, one of the greatest artists who have ever lived. (JJ)</p> <h2>Giulio Romano - The Gods of Mount Olympus and the Fall of the Giants (1530-1532)</h2> <p>Colossal painted boulders and gigantic figures seem to cascade towards you from all sides in this painting that swarms the walls and the ceiling of a room it turns into a mythological theatre. (JJ)</p> <h2>Robert Gober - Untitled Leg</h2> <p>Robert Gober's imitation of a man's foot is uncannily real: with its waxen skin and human hair, it juts out of a wall as if to trip you up.

(JJ)</p> <h2>Arshile Gorky - The Artist and his Mother (1926-1934), Agony (1947)</h2> <p>Gorky's memorial to his mother, who died of hunger in 1918 in the genocide of Armenians launched in the last days of the Ottoman empire, resembles an Etruscan tomb painting in its terracotta-like figures, based on an old photograph of them together. He went on to become one of the great generation of abstract expressionists in 1940s New York; Agony, painted the year before he killed himself, is jagged, pulsing, eerily beautiful.

In 1991 he spotted Arthur Smith's An Evening With Gary Lineker at the Edinburgh Fringe, which became a monumental hit, launching Caroline Quentin and spawning Loaded culture. Granada, where Harries made it himself, must have been thrilled; the BBC, LWT, YTV and Channel 4, who all turned it down, rather less so. Not that Granada built on that success: in 2003 the then chief executive Charles Allen tried to block production of The Deal - Peter Morgan's acclaimed play about Blair and Brown - and ITV refused to show the finished film, leaving Channel 4 to pick up the drama (and the Bafta it won). And then there was the trouble with The Queen - with ITV's \"erratic\" approach to funding Harries' 2006 Oscar-nominated film contributing to his departure as the broadcaster's drama controller.</p> <p>Now Harries' fledgling independent is producing Wallander for the BBC, based on the Swedish novelist Henning Mankell's series of bestselling detective books and starring Kenneth Branagh; Father &amp; Son, a thriller with Dougray Scott, Sophie Okonedo, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart, for ITV; and for the big screen, The Damned United, with Michael Sheen as Brian Clough and Timothy Spall as Peter Taylor. And yet still there are those who'd prefer it if no one backed him.</p> <p>When Harries left ITV last year to found Left Bank Pictures, it was one of the first independents to have BBC Worldwide take a 25% stake. Since then, other indies such as Big Talk and Baby Cow have done similar deals - but rivals disapprove of the deal and are taking their complaints about Worldwide's investments to the culture, media and sport select committee.</p> <p>\"I've been surprised how many fellow indies have taken such a strong line on this investment,\" says Harries. \"The money is tiny but the argument has been - why should BBC Worldwide do something others do? But I think it's important that people understand that the marketplace wasn't delivering. We saw all sorts of interesting people on the back of The Queen - Martin Sorrell, Richard Branson - but us being a start-up was a problem. They all wanted an acquisition.\" </p> <p>Harries' argument is that Worldwide went where no one else wanted to go. The money for the 25% stake allowed him to set up and run Left Bank for a year, employing staff and pitching ideas. \"The reaction of these big indies is born out of a fear that it's threatening their own market share. New indies are not good for them.\" </p> <p>We meet on the day John Simpson warns that the BBC is under threat if Ofcom chips at the licence fee. Harries argues that a successful Worldwide would provide money to supplement the licence fee - with one proviso. \"My view is that the BBC should spend its money - in TV terms - on what they do best that no one else does. I don't see the point in them buying formula one. That was a waste of money - why not let Sky do that? No one else is going to do Little Dorrit or Bleak House and no one else is going to find a new State of Play. The BBC has a responsibility to be there for original work.\"</p> <p>Harries, just back from the Mipcom programming market, sees the BBC's commitment as key in a market where commercial broadcasters appear to be struggling with imaginative high-profile drama. \"When I go out in the market I still get a good reaction - there's a desire for stuff, but right now money is pretty tight,\" he shrugs. \"I expect the accent will be more on entertainment and feelgood drama than the harder stuff.\"</p> <p>He predicts dramas such as Channel 4's recent The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall will be difficult to find in an industry threatened with the credit crunch and the rise of download culture. \"I think Channel 4 would like to keep doing it but I think they will find it hard. ITV is changing and not for the bad necessarily. It's becoming an entertainment channel with the odd piece of quality drama. You can't beat up ITV for their commercial pressures. If they judge they need X Factor for their money and audience and future then you can't blame them for that.\"</p> <p>He checks himself for a second and says he should be careful about saying too much. It was during an interview with a Guardian journalist in 2006 when he was ITV's controller of drama that he voiced his dissatisfaction at the way the network was being run - it ultimately led to him resigning at the end of his contract last year. Does he regret that?</p> <p>\"I feel that I was incredibly lucky to go when I did, like the last windsurfer on the beach - I got out with good ideas at the right time and people have listened. I was restless at Granada and knew my ambition was best satisfied somewhere else.\" He prefers smaller creative units and argues that ITV's merger has made it too big. \"Great shows come out of tight teams where there's a little bit of competition, a little bit of energy and they're focused,\" he says. \"The mistakes at ITV are very deep-rooted - it's a failure of years of getting to grips with the basic problems.\"</p> <p>He does still have affection for his old employer, and believes someone will \"sort it out\" - either existing management or a possible future owner. \"ITV is still very important - it's vital that we have a vibrant terrestrial commercial channel for a good few more years. We need big drama on ITV. That's why it's sad to see Michael Grade knocking the indie sector.\"</p> <p>Making great programming, Harries says, is incredibly hard if you see the UK as your only playground. Wallander cost \u00a32.5m - he got half from the BBC, had to pre-sell to America and Germany and get a tax break for shooting in Sweden. As a result, he'd like to operate as a studio \"making films and TV shows that could even spin off each other\" with Worldwide as the distributor and deal maker. \"I hope I'm what they want me to be,\" he grins, \"a producer who provides international drama, because international drama's where they're going to make money.\"</p> <p>Harries has long drawn on America for inspiration. Cold Feet, which he executive-produced, was an attempt at a British version of Thirtysomething, while the format of The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross was influenced by David Letterman. At the same time, he executive-produced The Royle Family and has recently found American distributors confused by the essential Britishness of The Damned United. </p> <p>He also uses stars, US-style, to pitch shows. \"When I sat down with Helen Mirren and talked about bringing Prime Suspect back she wasn't really interested. But she said - if it has some politics ... So Prime Suspect 6 became about the increasing numbers of illegal immigrants working in the UK. You couldn't walk into ITV and say, 'We want to make a four-hour drama about illegal immigration and the impact it has.' They'd have laughed you out of the room. But if you say it's a Prime Suspect with Helen Mirren ...\"</p> <p>This sounds a little like entryism, I venture. Harries laughs. \"I'm a great friend of Malcolm McLaren after making a film about the Sex Pistols, and Tony Wilson was my mentor. They were situationists with a love of art and pranksterism. It seeps into your work. Making mischief is a good thing in television. If you can have some fun then you should have some fun.\"</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 54<br><strong>Education</strong> Oakham School, Rutland, politics at Hull University <strong>1972-75</strong></p> <p><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1971-72</strong> reporter, Peterborough Evening Telegraph<br><strong>1975</strong> Southern News Service<br><strong>1976</strong> script writer/researcher/presenter for Granada<br><strong>1981</strong> freelance, director of Last Resort<br><strong>1992</strong> controller of comedy, Granada<br><strong>1994</strong> controller of entertainment and comedy, Granada<br><strong>2000 </strong>controller of drama and comedy, ITV<br><strong>2007-present </strong>chief executive, Left Bank Pictures</p>",
  "<p>There are still too many inequalities in the education system which prevent children from disadvantaged backgrounds from applying to study for a degree, according to the universities minister, David Lammy. </p> <p>Government, universities and schools need to increase efforts to tackle these inequalities, he will say in a speech today. </p> <p>Lammy, who was promoted to the ministerial post responsible for universities in the latest reshuffle, is due to address a conference in Oxford on black boys in higher education. He is expected to give a highly personal speech setting out how he benefited from higher education.</p> <p>A copy of the speech, seen by the Guardian, says that the proportion of university students who are black Caribbean males remains unchanged at just over 1%, and they are much more likely to be at local universities than at academically elite institutions. </p> <p>He will say schools are partly to blame. \"It's clear to me that at least part of the explanation for this is that young people's performance at school largely determines their prospects for admission to very selective institutions,\" the speech says. </p> <p>He sets out a range of initiatives to tackle inequalities but says: \"We obviously need to work harder on getting an equal chance for all young people.\"</p> <p>Lammy was the first black Briton to study for a master's in law at Harvard and went on to be elected MP for Tottenham in north London, where he grew up. </p> <p>Today he will say: \"In this country people like me are still the exception rather than the rule. And the same is even still true in the US, where a black man could be elected president in a few days' time. So we mustn't let the fact that some black people do make it lead us to become complacent.</p> <p>\"Because let's be honest about it, we're not yet living in a society where everyone has an equal chance. I'm not talking about racism, and this isn't just an issue that concerns black boys or even kids from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. It's equally true of white boys and girls from less well-off families.\"</p> <p>He goes on to describe some of the social barriers to children's learning in his Tottenham constituency. \"It's full of great people and they're full of potential. But when that potential isn't directed and offered an outlet, it's replaced by frustration. </p> <p>\"And I can tell you that when that happens you get too many boys - a lot of them black - running around the streets with knives or guns in their pockets. You get too many of them winding up in prison. And you get too many of them having their lives cut brutally short.\"</p> <p>He will argue there has been progress in universities - the number of black pupils at Oxford is up 20% on two years ago - but the government must consider how to attract people to higher education who missed out by leaving school.</p>",
  "<p>Martin Kettle makes several valid points about party political funding (The Corfu saga teaches that this is truly the age of cant, October 24). On his plea for public party funding, however - something raised many times by parties themselves - he fails to address a number of issues.</p> <p>First, party politics raises so many problems of its own that the issue of party control of parliament and the whipping system is something that needs to be examined prior to the introduction of public party funding. </p> <p>Second, how should such funding be apportioned? If it is pro rata to votes cast, it favours the major parties, while if pro rata to seats in parliament, then first-past-the-post skews the amounts allocated even more disproportionately in favour of the ruling party.</p> <p>Third, the electorate votes for a candidate and not a party. This is even more relevant if one considers that when I first became eligible to vote, ballot papers had only the names of the candidates and no mention of party or politics. This also begs the question, if an independent candidate stands, should such a candidate receive state funding?</p> <p>Lastly, why should those of us who do not support any party be expected to have a proportion of our taxes handed out to sustain political parties? After all, parties are not part of the state, so it is not like paying towards state schools if one has no children, or contributing to the NHS if one is in the best of health.<br><strong>John Malcomson</strong><br>Sheffield </p> <p>Yet again we have the argument that if only politicians were not \"forced\" to raise money, the poor dears, then shady meetings and dealings with sleazy people and \"perhaps\" donors, could be eliminated (Letters, October 24). This is like the old argument that you have to pay responsible people handling public money (and bankers too!) very high salaries so that they can \"resist bribery\" and \"temptation\". Anyway why should mainstream political parties that have manifestly failed us all - and all have rich friends anyway (New Labour included) - then be sustained even further by state money while the tiny minority groups, who are usually advocating stuff for ordinary and fairly poor people, get sidelined even further? Democracy? Nonsense.<br><strong>Don Hoskins</strong><br>London </p> <p>As less than 1% of the UK population belong to the three main political parties, its no wonder they go sniffing around the rich for funds to keep them in power.

  "<p>Porsche, the German sports carmaker, is poised to seize full control of Volkswagen after taking its holding in Europe's biggest motor manufacturer close to 75%.</p> <p>Stuttgart-based Porsche said yesterday it had raised its direct stake in VW this month from 35.2% to 42.6% and had options on a further 31.5%.</p> <p>Depending on the global economic situation, it intended to lift its stake to above 75% in 2009, freeing the way for a \"domination agreement\" under German corporate law.</p> <p>Porsche, dwarfed by its takeover target, said it would cross the 50% hurdle in the coming weeks. It made its move as the European commission prepares to take Germany to court over its refusal to remove a 20% blocking minority in VW held on behalf of the state by Lower Saxony. The EC decision, to be announced by internal market commissioner Charlie McCreevy this week, is the latest stage in a long-running dispute between Brussels and Berlin over the 1960 \"VW law\" struck down by the European court of justice just over a year ago.</p> <p>Germany's revised law still hands Lower Saxony, home of VW's headquarters, a 20% vote even though the country's corporate law normally fixes any blocking minority at 25%. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, told 30,000 VW workers last month she would fight to uphold the veto but her government could face fines of tens of millions of euros if it defies the court. Porsche has sided with the EC.</p> <p>The sports carmaker, the world's most profitable motor firm thanks to options trading, has built up its stake in VW partly through abortive \"short selling\" in Volkswagen stock by hedge funds. As the funds were forced to unwind their positions, VW's share price rose sharply.</p>",
  "<p>Winston Churchill once described John Foster Dulles, the US secretary of state during the cold war, as a bull who carried around his own china shop. It could be said of Peter Mandelson that he is a hurricane seeking landfall; a force of destruction capable of waterlogging friend and foe alike. </p> <p>When he first resigned from the government in 1998, Tony Blair's closest ally took with him Geoffrey Robinson, an intimate of Gordon Brown. Now if he is forced from office a third time, he may also bring down the shadow chancellor, George Osborne. Or so some commentators hope. But it is unlikely, and anybody who thinks Osborne, not Mandelson, will now be the story - and that Brown has used his old adversary to damage the opposition - is wrong.</p> <p>Every reporter in London knows Mandelson is news. Not only is he \"the prince of darkness\", always willing to whisper a little poison about rivals and enemies, he also enjoys what the papers call \"the high life\", favours policies at the extreme end of Blairism, and has a sexual orientation that Fleet Street, 40 years after homosexual law reform, still regards as a subject for sniggering and vague disapproval.</p> <p>Since his re-appointment to the cabinet 24 days ago, Mandelson has scarcely been off the front pages. That is some achievement while the world financial system is struggling through its worst post-war crisis. Within two days of his return, the Sunday Times splashed \"Mandelson damned PM to top Tory\". We now know the \"top Tory\" was Osborne and since then, we have learned of the new business secretary's associations with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminium tycoon who entertained Mandelson on his yacht in Corfu, and Nat Rothschild, a member of the banking dynasty who is also a hedge fund owner. We have learned, too, of Mandelson's \"golden parachute\" from Brussels, of his plans to privatise Royal Mail and of his wish to ditch proposals to allow employees to request flexible working.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as Mandy is elevated to the peerage, we get attempts at faintly homophobic humour. \"Shuffle, shimmer, shimmy, in he glided,\" wrote the Mail's Quentin Letts, describing Mandelson's formal introduction to the Lords, \"... he must have had his bottom almost completely clenched to have moved so seamlessly.\" In the robing room, he was seen \"touching the side of his hair, patting his fur-edged robes\". But he is Baron Mandelson of Foy, \"not Fey\". Take care not to split your sides.</p> <p>Then came Rothschild's allegation in a letter to last Tuesday's Times, that Osborne wanted to solicit a Tory donation from Deripaska in Corfu. \"Osborne fights for political life\", was the Independent's headline. The following day, its columnist Matthew Norman argued that Osborne was \"finished as a viable future chancellor\". He was \"clinging to his job by a thread\", reported the Mirror. The tables had been turned. Mandelson, from being Brown's nemesis, was now his saviour.</p> <p>A nice plot twist, but wishful thinking. The Mandelson story has momentum; the Osborne story does not. Most papers believe the Tories will win the next election. Attempts to blacken the Tories are just the spin doctors' last desperate throws. Mandelson, the original \"sultan of spin\" and \"the most vile individual in politics I have ever come across\" (Richard Littlejohn), will play a role in New Labour's downfall as he did in its rise. That's the storyline, and it will take a lot of changing.</p> <p>Rothschild may well have shopped Osborne out of genuine disgust that private conversations were betrayed, but journalists rapidly pinned responsibility on Mandelson. The Mail's front page on Wednesday didn't picture Osborne looking shifty, but Mandelson roaring with manic laughter. The prince of darkness had reverted to type. \"Hovering menacingly in the background like a pantomime villain,\" wrote the Sun's Martin Phillips, \" ... is a familiar yet sinister presence ... As with a spider at the centre of a tangled web, all plots and intrigues seem to lead back to Mandy and always have done.\" All, always? Was it possible that Rothschild, at Mandelson's prompting, had lured Osborne into talks with Deripaska? The hint in Phillips's copy was very faint, but it was unmistakably there.</p> <p>As for the PM's call for an inquiry into Osborne's conduct, \"there's not a yacht wrong\" was the Sun's headline. In the end, no money was exchanged. It was a disgrace, the Mail and Sun agreed, that the BBC made far more of the anti-Osborne allegations than of those against Mandelson. By the end of the week, it was Mandelson under scrutiny again: the Guardian reported that he had dined with Deripaska in October 2004, earlier than previously admittted, while the Times alleged he stayed with Rothschild at his chalet in Klosters. This added further evidence to Sunday Times reports that he accepted hospitality from Rothschild in the Caribbean, plus flights on a private jet.</p> <p>Evidence of what exactly? Well, er, Rothschild's hedge fund lobbied the European Commission to approve a takeover bid and, er, Mandelson didn't stop it. The truth is that there is almost no limit to the stories the press can contrive about Mandelson's \"links\" which raise \"unanswered questions\" and possible \"conflicts of interest\" - newspaper codes for \"we think something dodgy is going on but we're not sure what\". </p> <p>We know Mandelson, in his own words, is \"intensely relaxed\" about \"the filthy rich\" and likes their company - offer him a berth on a yacht and he'll clamber aboard. Formerly EU trade commissioner, now UK business secretary, he has every excuse for meeting tycoons from time to time. And almost any Brussels or Whitehall decision about business or trade can be presented as Mandelson's personal responsibility, while taking even a cup of tea with a Russian billionaire will inevitably \"link\" him, albeit by a long chain, to murky dealings. Given that both business and politics are full of rivalries and resentments, it doesn't take much journalistic ingenuity to find what looks like dirt.</p> <p>The Osborne story was dying within 48 hours. We saw once more pictures of Oxford's Bullingdon Club, of which both Osborne and Rothschild as well as David Cameron were members, and that was that. Journalists, however, know they can pull off a unique treble and bring down Mandelson once more. They will keep on trying.</p>",
  "<p>If there is one thing that Nicolas Sarkozy likes even more than eyeing up Rolexes or single-handedly saving Europe from the financial abyss, it has to be a good, old-fashioned court battle. His threat to sue a company producing a voodoo doll in his image, complete with glowering expression, has sparked derision both from the firm responsible, which denounced it as \"totally disproportionate\", and from the media, which has made no secret of wholeheartedly enjoying it.</p> <p>But if there is a curious sense of deja-vu about the affair, it is perhaps because it is by no means the first time Sarko had turned to legal action to avenge his despoiled image or hurt pride. Sarkozy is by far the most litigious president in his country's recent history, and the French have become wearily accustomed to seeing their diminutive head of state throw his toys out of the Elysee's gilt-encrusted pram.</p> <p>In January, shortly before his wedding to Carla Bruni, the president decided to sue the low-budget airline Ryanair for using a picture of the couple in an advertisement. Just weeks later it was the turn of magazine Le Nouvel Observateur to face his wrath after it published an article claiming Sarkozy had begged his ex-wife to come back to him by text message. (The reporter subsequently apologised and the case was dropped.)</p> <p>This month the Elysee's legal team have been especially busy after Sarkozy announced he was suing the country's former head of the intelligence services over leaked extracts from the top spy's diary and a slew of unsubstantiated allegations concerning the president's sexual and financial exploits.</p> <p>Some say Sarko's unusual behaviour stems from the fact that he has put his personal life on display in a manner unprecedented for any French leader. Others blame the coming together of a quick temper and an ego the size of Mont Blanc. </p> <p>Whatever his motives, the president should be aware that in law, as in politics, actions can have unintended consequences. Previously a literary obscurity, Nicolas Sarkozy - the Voodoo Manual is now No 1 on the Amazon France bestseller list: a book, a doll and a dozen sharp needles, all yours for just \u20ac12.30. It sounds like a bargain.</p>",
  "<p>Australia flexed their muscles to record a comfortable 30-6 opening victory over New Zealand, inspired by a courageous performance from Johnathan Thurston.</p> <p>The North Queensland Cowboys scrum-half had been expected to pull out of yesterday's match after his uncle was killed in a vicious beating in Brisbane on Friday. But Thurston turned down the option of withdrawing and revived his State of Origin half-back combination with the Kangaroos captain Darren Lockyer to defeat a hugely disappointing Kiwi side.</p> <p>The centre Israel Folau scored two of Australia's five tries after Greg Inglis had put them ahead with a typically classy effort in the 14th minute.</p> <p>Australia and New Zealand both picked up one worry for the rest of the tournament. The Kangaroos lost the wing Brent Tate with a serious concussion that must make him doubtful for next Sunday's game against England, while New Zealand's fiery centre Steve Matai was put on report for alleged use of his elbow.</p> <p>It was a largely low-key match in front of a crowd of 34,157, which exceeded the expectations of tournament organisers, but there was the depressing sight of Mexican waves rippling around the stadium after the Kiwis' challenge had fizzled out early in the second half.</p> <p>They had earlier threatened to provide a much tighter contest when a strong drive from the forward Sam Rapira put them on the front foot, with the stand-off Benji Marshall capitalising to send Sika Manu charging through for a try, Matai converting to cut the deficit to 8-6.</p> <p>But Australia immediately regained control after Jerome Ropati's unforced error on the next set of six with Thurston and Lockyer instigating a slick move before Billy Slater sent Joel Monaghan over in the left corner. Folau's first try early in the second half removed any doubt about the outcome before an elusive run by Thurston laid on a try for Slater, with Folau's second in the closing stages sealing a comfortable victory.</p> <p>The possibility of France emerging from Pool Two as the dark horses remains after a 36-18 win over Scotland that showed glimpses of their potential. John Monie's talented side were disjointed at times but still accounted for gallant Scotland. </p> <p>The Scots had possible tries to Duncan MacGillivray and John Duffy ruled out by the video referee Phil Cooley at crucial stages, but they were most annoyed by John Wilson's first-half try for the French. That came with MacGillivray down in back-play for several minutes after being knocked out, and helped to give France an 18-6 lead.</p> <p>The French made the most of their opportunities, with their excellent captain J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guisset finishing with two rare tries. With his fellow Catalans player Thomas Bosc looking accomplished at stand-off, hopes remain that the French can emulate the Dragons' success in Super League this season.</p>",
  "<p>The disgruntled Aston Villa fan who blew the whistle on John Carew's visit to a lap-dancing club will probably offer him a lift home instead next time after the Norwegian forward came off the bench to score one goal and set up another yesterday.</p> <p>Carew's visit to The Rocket Club in the early hours of Thursday morning when he was not definitely ruled out of the game later that day against Ajax, which Villa won 2-1, may have cost him two weeks' wages, in the region of \u00a3100,000, but it seems only to have enhanced his popularity with the Villa fans, who serenaded him from the start with rude songs.</p> <p>Villa were leading through a penalty from Gareth Barry when the England midfielder went off with an ankle injury eight minutes after the interval and Carew came on. Three minutes later he held off Paul Scharner to get his head to Ashley Young's corner, his flick hitting Gabriel Agbonlahor and crossing the line, and five minutes after that Agbonlahor tore past Scharner to cross for Carew to thump in a header from six yards out.</p> <p>His manager, Martin O'Neill, said of Carew's indiscretion: \"John thinks there are mitigating circumstances. I'm always prepared to listen, so I listened to what John said and then decided that he was wrong. John's very popular with the crowd and he regained his popularity with me when he headed that one in. </p> <p>\"It wasn't the brightest thing to be doing. He did possibly feel that he wouldn't be playing but he hadn't been told beforehand. He assures me that it won't happen again and up until next week I'll probably believe him.\"</p> <p>There had been few openings before Barry sent Agbonlahor into space down the left flank with 21 minutes gone. The England Under-21 forward reached the ball on the edge of the penalty area and, even though there seemed to be little danger, Titus Bramble decided to slide in to win the ball. He won it but only after he had made contact with the Villa striker, and the referee, Michael Jones, pointed to the spot. Barry calmly put the ball in Chris Kirkland's right corner.</p> <p>The Wigan fans were furious but their manager, Steve Bruce, found fault only with Bramble. \"Titus should have stayed on his feet and it's a glaring error of judgment by him.\" </p> <p>The hosts had several opportunities to equalise, with Olivier Kapo passing up the best of them, shooting high over the bar after Brad Friedel could only palm Wilson Palacios's shot into his path. The chances continued to come for them after the restart, the substitute Jason Koumas's low drive from 25 yards being pushed around the post by Friedel, and Scharner heading wide after he was left unmarked for Daniel de Ridder's corner.</p> <p>But Scharner was exposed twice in the space of five minutes, lacking the strength to prevent Carew from glancing Ashley Young's corner on to Agbonlahor and into the net, then being outpaced by Agbonlahor, who crossed for Carew to head in his sixth of the season.</p> <p>Villa were in a ruthless mood and the substitute Steve Sidwell, picked out on the edge of the area by James Milner, crashed a shot into the top corner in the final minute for his first goal since joining from Chelsea in the summer.</p> <p>Bruce, whose side were beaten 3-2 at Liverpool a week earlier and have lost three consecutive matches for the first time in his reign, added: \"Three of the goals were so poor defensively that it's not acceptable at this level. If you do that against a team like Aston Villa then you get your backsides kicked.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa)</p>",
  "<p>\"How quickly things change in football,\" remarked Daniel Levy yesterday at the beginning of a meticulously crafted 2,434-word explanation of why another regime at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> had unravelled in spectacular fashion. The chairman's understatement was breathtaking.</p> <p>Levy and his club are no strangers to dramatic stories in the minutes before midnight - witness the events of virtually every transfer-deadline day in recent times. But he surpassed himself entirely with what went bump on Saturday night. In one fell swoop he ripped up the management structure that he had staked his reputation on, placed his faith in Harry Redknapp - a character he had long admired but never previously secured - and completed the transformation of Juande Ramos from leading light on the European coaching circuit to blown-out mess in less than 12 months.</p> <p>Levy was in the United States on business last week but his thoughts rarely strayed from the turmoil back in N17. Around the clock, he made phone calls to his confidants as he weighed up the decisions that needed to be made. The easiest part was the dismissal of Damien Comolli, the sporting director, who was held to account for the disastrous business in the summer transfer window that left the squad unbalanced. But what to do about Ramos vexed him. Levy is such a workaholic that he hardly sleeps; his mind whirred with possibilities.</p> <p>He had been adamant that he would not sack the Spaniard, whom he went to extraordinary lengths to lure from Sevilla this time last year. He came to the conclusion, though, that the coaching setup needed fresh impetus. One option was to bring in a British coach to help Ramos, which would have undermined his assistants Gus Poyet and Marcos Alvarez. This would not have sat well with Ramos.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, Levy listened most intently to the forceful voices around the fringes of the club. The most forceful of those was Paul Kemsley, who used to be the vice-chairman at Tottenham and is a close friend of Redknapp's. The powers at Enic, the company that is majority owned by the Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis and has control of the club, also urged Levy to make wholesale changes and, when he returned from the States on Saturday, he did just that.</p> <p>\"We have achieved too much over the last seven years - three successive qualifications for Europe, a League Cup win, training-centre planning permission and still more to announce - to allow this to be overtaken and thrown away overnight,\" said Levy. \"We have suffered a setback and we have taken strong action.\"</p> <p>He was mindful that results had stagnated at the end of last season. The team won only three times in the Premier League after their Carling Cup final triumph over Chelsea. But surprisingly the meagre points return did not signal a problem at the start of this season as much as the botched transfer dealings, when the club sold their prolific strikers, Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane, and failed to replace them adequately.</p> <p>Ramos's reputation has been built on his sense of adventure. When he first took charge at Tottenham he caught the eye with his tactical boldness, regularly substituting defenders with attackers to successfully chase results. This term, though, he had fewer aces up his sleeve. His players remained largely behind him but they grew more and more afraid to express themselves, and Ramos, who struggled to grasp the English language, could not find the antidote.</p> <p>Levy's reverting to a more traditional management structure - \"Damien [Comolli] will not be directly replaced,\" he confirmed - can be seen as both a humiliating climbdown and a commendable admission of an error in judgment. He maintained, though, that the failure was the fault of individuals within the system rather than the system itself. \"Quite simply, we failed because we were not as decisive or as successful in identifying or replacing the two strikers [Berbatov and Keane] as early as we should have been,\" he added.</p> <p>Levy's decision to sack Martin Jol, who had led the club to successive fifth-placed finishes, and reach for the Champions League stars with Ramos gave him little margin for error. The plan always looked risky but Levy could not have foreseen it backfiring to such an extent. He now wants to start again, with what amounts to a clean slate. \"Harry Redknapp's experience of the UK and international transfer markets will be of critical importance and I shall be looking to Harry for clarity on our priorities,\" said Levy. \"As chairman, and as previously in our former structure, I must, ultimately, rely on the knowledge and judgment of my technical staff to give me a clear football-based view and recommendation on our transfer targets.\"</p> <p>The chalice now belongs to Redknapp.</p>",
  "<p>An heirloom can become so fragile over time that each new generation inherits it with mounting trepidation. Perhaps they wish secretly that it were not their responsibility. Luiz Felipe Scolari is now the man who happened to be in charge when<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\"> Chelsea's</a> magnificent run of 86 matches without defeat at home in the Premier League ended. </p> <p>Victory for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a> was fully deserved, as is their place at the top of the table. Whatever Chelsea make of the outcome, the visitors gave another indication that they may become champions of England for the first time since 1990. This piece of evidence clicks into place beside the comeback against Manchester United at Anfield last month. </p> <p>This game made fewer demands. The margin of victory might have been wider, Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side almost doubling their lead in the 62nd minute when Xabi Alonso's free-kick cannoned off a post. </p> <p>This is no time for Chelsea to give thanks, but Ashley Cole ought to be relieved that he did not receive a second caution from the referee, Howard Webb, for a foul on the substitute Ryan Babel. The left-back was to suffer nonetheless, scything wide a knockdown from the substitute Franco Di Santo after 73 minutes. Otherwise Chelsea lacked menace. Javier Mascherano embodied the excellence of a Liverpool midfield that both parried and made sharp thrusts of its own. </p> <p>They merited a sleeker goal, although the winner is in no danger of being disowned. In the 10th minute Alvaro Arbeloa's throw-in was headed on by the remarkably industrious Dirk Kuyt and into the path of Alonso. The Spaniard's shot from the edge of the area broke off Jose Bosingwa to wrong-foot Petr Cech. </p> <p>This was Liverpool's first Premier League goal at this stadium under Ben\u00edtez. That must be viewed as more than an accident. Some will remain doubtful whether there is the quality in depth to tide the club over in a long campaign fought on several fronts, but the injury to a key performer, in Fernando Torres, has not undone them. It was their opponents who were limited here. </p> <p>Despite the early goal leaving great stretches of time for recovery, no momentum was achieved by Chelsea. They have been counting on the movement and passing in midfield that shreds the opposition, but Liverpool are about as well equipped as a side can be to counter that approach. Scolari has no alternative method to unsettle the opposition. With Nicolas Anelka as the one experienced forward available at present, defenders are not apprehensive. </p> <p>Chelsea have cut loose in this campaign against teams who were incapable of halting their build-up play, but in fixtures of this calibre Scolari will suffer from time to time if there are no credible alternatives in attack. The Brazilian is reduced to offering estimates as to the recovery time Didier Drogba will need after knee and ankle problems; after this defeat it was put at 10 days. In truth, outsiders are still to be persuaded that he will ever be in perfect condition again. It should be borne in mind that his total in the last Premier League campaign was a modest eight goals. </p> <p>Chelsea's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, recently ruled out signings in January, saying: \"There isn't any need.\" Scolari had better hope this is merely a negotiating tactic rather than a deeply held belief. They may have cut loose on several occasions but higher-order rivals understand how to check them. A defeat such as this could have been foreseen last month when it took Salomon Kalou's 80th-minute leveller to prevent Manchester United from making off with full points. </p> <p>If there is any marginal benefit for Chelsea in the wake of these events, it may be that they will be spared some of the attention that is habitually trained upon them, whereas Liverpool can prepare for a more intense scrutiny. </p> <p>Incrementally, the Anfield squad has been upgraded and, for instance, the arrival of Albert Riera on the left of midfield has improved the balance. Moreover, the established strengths are intact. When Deco did burrow deep into the penalty area after 76 minutes, the block challenge from Jamie Carragher was characteristically resolute.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez, for his part, is no novice in occasions of this sort. Scolari shoved John Terry into attack as time petered out, but Liverpool countered by bringing on an extra centre-back in Sami Hyypia. If Liverpool are viewed as real contenders for the title, though, they will have to deal with the expectations heaped upon them and a rising intensity in the challenge they meet each weekend.</p> <p>For Scolari there is an irony to be considered. The unbeaten sequence spanned the reigns of Claudio Ranieri, who was in command when Arsenal won a league game here on February 21 2004, Jose Mourinho and Avram Grant. Scolari has been more admired by neutrals than any of them because of the elegant football he demands. Yet the record has ended on his watch. </p> <p>Regardless of concerns about the forward line, this manager is bound to start again without compromising a vision that will be to his credit and that of Chelsea.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Javier Mascherano</p> <p>He typified the concentration and strength of the visiting midfielders as Chelsea were either stopped or outplayed</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> The tackle that stopped a promising surge by the substitute Juliano Belletti</p>",
  "<p>It's official. We don't have to wait until the Eurovision song contest to laugh at the Norwegians, the Irish, the Icelanders or any of those funny, small countries. The prime minister and his new Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy, have decided that when it comes to the wee countries, it's OK to have a go. In fact, holding these nations up to ridicule is in the service of a higher cause: winning the Glenrothes byelection and trashing the idea of Scottish independence.</p> <p>Given little, if any, real Labour advance in the national polls, the contest in Glenrothes is taking on the status of win or bust for Gordon Brown. Losing the prime minister's neighbouring seat to the SNP might just have been recoverable if the Tories were once again in Labour's sights. But if Brown suffers the double whammy of a loss in Fife and only marginal gains in the polls, it is hard to see any way forward. Stand by, then, for the most ferocious assault on Alex Salmond and the SNP yet. </p> <p>Those who have watched in horror at the SNP's electoral progress over the past 18 months can barely contain their glee at the troubles faced by Ireland, Iceland and other small countries caught up in the global economic crisis. The argument is that only large countries have the muscle to protect savers and \"hardworking families\" when global recession hits. In cruder terms, English taxpayers are coming to the rescue of feckless Scottish bankers. </p> <p>There is no doubt that the politics of independence has been shaken. But the pieces may not fall quite where the unionist diehards are predicting. Before the global crash, there were signs that Labour was changing its argument against the SNP. For election after election, Brown had dictated the basic message - that independence for Scotland would be a catastrophe and prompt massive cuts in public spending as the country faced up to a huge deficit without the benefit of subsidies from taxpayers south of the border.</p> <p>Recently that argument has faced two problems. First, people in Scotland no longer believe it, or at least do not see it as a barrier to voting for the SNP. Second, it was proving uncomfortable for Brown himself, the chancellor and other leading Scottish politicians at Westminster, as their repeated (and false) claims that Scotland was heavily dependent on Treasury handouts caused some in England to argue that Scottish independence seemed a reasonable idea after all.</p> <p>Those realities prompted a rethink: it was accepted that post-independence, Scotland would no longer be an economic basket case, and that Scotland and England were stronger together and weaker apart. That new thinking has now gone the way of banking stocks. The old messages are being wheeled out, only much harder: vote for independence if you want, but when disaster strikes you're on your own.</p> <p>For the SNP, the last month has been uncomfortable. In recent years the success of small European countries has proved intoxicating. To some extent the \"small is beautiful\" analysis will have to be looked at afresh, but with the exception of Iceland there is little to suggest that small countries will permanently reverse their impressive growth rates. Norway, Finland and Sweden are still expected to grow their economies this year and next.</p> <p>The prime minister is first going to have to win a byelection, a general election and a referendum on Scottish independence having led the UK and Scotland into a recession and with unemployment forecast to reach Thatcherite levels. Against that background, attempting to scare voters in Glenrothes away from the SNP and Scots in general from independence on the basis of the foolish decisions of a few bankers in Reykjavik doesn't seem quite so clever.</p> <p>\u2022 Ewan Crawford was private secretary to former SNP leader John Swinney <a href=\"mailto:ewan.crawford@uws.ac.uk\">ewan.crawford@uws.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Norman Marsh, who has died aged 95, was a distinguished law reformer and academic, who, as a founding member of the Law Commission, helped to reformulate the general principles of criminal law and, as secretary-general of the International Commission of Jurists, prompted wide debate on the rule of law in a free society.</p> <p>Marsh was born in Bath, son of Horace Marsh, a watchmaker and jeweller, and his wife, Lucy, who had a dressmaking business. Norman was from an early age bookish and politically a liberal - in both respects unlike his parents. They were prosperous enough to send him to Monkton Combe school, Bath, from which he went to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he read law, took the degrees of BA and BCL, and won a Vinerian scholarship. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1937 and became a pupil of Gerald Gardiner, who was later to become Harold Wilson's first Lord Chancellor.</p> <p>In 1936 Marsh had gone to Germany to improve his German. In Halle, he met Christel Christinnecke, an apprentice bookseller, and they became engaged. They had planned to marry in Germany, but in 1939, a few weeks before the outbreak of war, Christel was denounced to the Gestapo for making anti-Nazi comments. She fled to England, where she and Norman were married immediately. Christel was a woman of great charm and character. They were happily married for more than 60 years until her death in 2000. </p> <p>Because of his knowledge of German, Marsh was commissioned in the Intelligence Corps during the war. He interrogated prisoners of war, and at the end of the war joined the British Control Commission in Germany with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.</p> <p>Marsh decided not to return to practice at the bar, and in 1946 he became the Stowell fellow in civil law at University College, Oxford. He was appointed a university lecturer the following year. His interests went beyond the technicalities of law to include a fascination with the rule of law at national and international level. In 1956 my father, Professor Arthur Goodhart, who was then the master of University College, persuaded Marsh to take leave of absence from Oxford to become the secretary-general of the International Commission of Jurists, which had been founded in 1952 and was then based in The Hague. In this role Marsh travelled widely and organised an important conference in New Delhi on \"the rule of law in a free society\".</p> <p>In 1958 Marsh returned to Oxford, but two years later he moved to London to become the director of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. He bought one of the most beautiful houses in London - a large Queen Anne house on Clapham Common North Side, where he and Christel lived for 40 years. Clapham was an appropriate location; Marsh would have fitted well into the Clapham of William Wilberforce. He was high-minded, modest, learned, dedicated to good causes, and austere, though with a strong capacity for affection.</p> <p>In 1964, Gardiner became Lord Chancellor and set up the Law Commission as a standing body to review and reform the law - next to the Open University, perhaps the most important bequest of the Wilson governments. Gardiner appointed his former pupil to the commission to serve under its first chairman, Sir Leslie (later Lord) Scarman. Marsh was a member from its inception in 1965 until his retirement in 1978 - by far the longest term of office of any commissioner, and one which is unlikely to be equalled. This was the high point of his career. His many achievements included serving as joint chairman of the working party on general principles of the criminal law and of the working party on matrimonial property. In both cases, their reports led to substantial changes in the law. During this period, Marsh also served as a member of the Younger Committee on Privacy and of the Royal Commission on Compensation for Personal Injury. He was appointed an honorary QC in 1967 and a CBE in 1977.</p> <p>Marsh was for many years a member of the council of Justice, which acts as the British section of the International Commission of Jurists. He was an active member; well into his eighties, he travelled by coach to Paris and back to attend a meeting with the French section. He played an important role in Amnesty International in its early days, as a member of its policy committee and a manager of its prisoners of conscience fund. He was also active in many other good causes, having been a vice-chairman of Age Concern, chairman of the Clapham Society, and a trustee of the Gilbert Murray Trust. </p> <p>In his last years he had the tireless support of Marlys Deeds. She was also from Germany and had escaped in one of the 1938 Kindertransports. She survives him, along with the two sons and two daughters of his marriage to Christel.</p> <p>\u2022 Norman Stayner Marsh, lawyer, born July 26 1913; died October 15 2008</p>",
  "<p>The orphanage, a large brick house in Tirana's old quarter, promised shelter to the city's abandoned street children, who came barefoot and clutching siblings in search of a place to rebuild their lives. </p> <p>For five years, dozens of boy and girls passed through the gates of 32 Dervish Hekali Street, run by British missionaries in Albania's capital.</p> <p>But what should have been a sanctuary for vulnerable boys and girls became the site of one of eastern Europe's most shocking child sex abuse scandals. Three evangelical Britons, including the director of the orphanage, David Brown, have been accused of abusing children in their care.</p> <p>The trials of Brown, 57, and two helpers at his shelter - Dino Christodoulou, 45, a social therapy nurse from Blackburn in Lancashire, and Robin Arnold, 56, a salesman from Cromer in Norfolk - have barely been reported outside Albania. </p> <p>But disturbing testimony from children delivered by video link to a small Tirana court will have far-reaching repercussions for child protection mechanisms between the UK and other countries. </p> <p>Who knew what about the abuse, how and when, are questions that have yet to be fully answered. The men themselves, in interviews with the Guardian inside their prison, did not deny that the abuse took place; instead they blamed each other for acts that have horrified Albania. </p> <p>But there are some facts about the story that has been unfolding in district court one that nobody disputes. </p> <p>It was in early 2000 that Brown, a charity worker from Edinburgh, travelled to Albania to help refugees who had crossed the border, fleeing the conflict in Kosovo. He encountered neglected Gypsy children begging on the streets and supported them with food and money.</p> <p>The following year, with support from churches in Albania and the UK, he set about opening an orphanage which, claiming to be receiving instructions from God, Brown named His Children. </p> <p>Missionaries affiliated with churches as far away as Oklahoma travelled to Tirana to care for the children and give Bible lessons. Brown became a well-known figure in Tirana; a tall man with a thick, white beard, he was often seen scouring the city's streets for children in need.</p> <p>\"He bought me biscuits, a coke and gave me 500 lek [\u00a33.20],\" said one of Brown's first recruits to the orphanage, Nazmi Tatushi, now 21. \"I had no shoes. No haircut. Stinking.\"</p> <p>One of four young men who live in an apartment paid for by Brown, and have testified in his favour in court, Tatushi added: \"David said to me: my son, why don't you come to my house? He was a good man for the street kids in Albania. Only ever did we see love in that house.\" </p> <p>That, according to the testimony of other children, would soon change. By 2004 Brown, who worked with children for 35 years in Scotland, had developed a tense relationship with Albanian social workers, who complained his home lacked the facilities for 40 children and babies. </p> <p>By his own admission he failed to check the backgrounds of all the missionary volunteers who were given unsupervised access to children. He also allowed two young boys into his bed when they complained of nightmares, something he later described as \"naive\". </p> <p>When, in October that year, children began to speak about being sexually abused at the home, Brown, who was at first not named by the children as a perpetrator, devised a plan with the help of a close-knit group of evangelical Christians to keep the complaints secret from the Albanian authorities.</p> <p>Brown said he concealed the sexual abuse suffered by children at his orphanage from the Albanian authorities because he feared they would close the shelter, and now regretted doing so.</p> <p>Christodoulou and Arnold were banned from the orphanage after Brown said children had identified them as abusers. Eighteen months later, in May 2006, the scandal made headline news across the country after Albanian police and social services raided the orphanage and arrested Brown following a tip-off about allegations of sexual abuse. </p> <p>Ten boys, aged between four and 13, eventually told police they had been sexually abused by one or more of the three Britons, who have been charged with \"homosexual relations with minors\". Christodoulou and Arnold were extradited to Albania in May. In some cases the children claimed to have been bound to a balcony, gagged and raped.</p> <p>Defence lawyers claim the children are unreliable witnesses who have been \"manipulated\" by the prosecution. </p> <p>Although their trial is continuing, the men, who if found guilty could face up to 20 years in jail, spoke to the Guardian in Prison 302, a drab ex-communist jail. </p> <p>Through iron bars, Brown accused Christodoulou and Arnold of abusing boys behind his back. \"They were wolves in sheep's clothing.</p> <p>\"I came to Albania because I wanted to help the Albanian children. Everything that I set out to do has been violated. I was these children's father.\" </p> <p>A verdict in Brown's trial, which rests on accusations from two boys, is expected this week. Lawyers believe the outcome may determine the fate of Christodoulou and Arnold. Their trial - which is separate from Brown's - began last month.</p> <p>Christodoulou faces the most serious allegations - eight boys say he sexually abused them. But, smiling, Christodoulou dismissed the accusations against him as \"absurd\". \"I suspect [abuse] did happen at the home,\" he said. \"I have been stitched up to take the blame for what the others have done. The children have been manipulated to say these things.\"</p> <p>Arnold also denied abusing children at the orphanage, but admitted he had twice been convicted of indecently assaulting teenage boys in the UK. He said it was \"obvious\" abuse was rife at the home.</p>",
  "<p>The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this week amid mounting speculation of a new round of coordinated international action to halt the panic that has swept the world's financial markets.</p> <p>The need for further moves has been underlined by fresh signs of strain in the global banking system and the wider economy. On Friday stockmarkets around the world nosedived and the pound crashed as investors reacted to the worst fall in UK economic output for almost 20 years.</p> <p>Last night the International Monetary Fund reached a draft agreement to lend Ukraine $16.5bn (\u00a310.5bn) in exchange for reforms to the domestic banking system, while Kommunalkredit, Austria's eighth largest bank, became the first in the country to seek state aid to ensure liquidity.</p> <p>Figures from the US this week are expected to show the US economy contracted by about 0.5% in the third quarter.</p> <p>\"The incoming data are likely to confirm that the [US] economy has entered deep recession and that deflation is now a serious threat,\" Capital Economics said in a weekly research note. JP Morgan economist Bruce Kasman warned that the signs were pointing increasingly \"to a deep and synchronised global recession\".</p> <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by half a percentage point, taking US rates down to 1%. Nick Parsons, head of markets strategy at nabCapital in London, said yesterday he expected the Bank of England monetary policy committee to follow the Fed's move with a one-point cut from the current 4.5%. He said the MPC had not made a full one-point cut since the Bank of England was made independent in 1997, but added: \"Unprecedented times call for unprecedented action.\"</p> <p>Lord Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, urged the government to cut interest rates by 1% as soon as possible. The cross-bench peer told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: \"I feel that they [the Bank of England] have been so bound by the inflation target that the looking after of the stability of the economy, of helping small businesses, was almost a secondary condition. That's why I felt that they should have been able to take proactive moves much earlier to reduce interest rates. I think one of the fundamental problems ... has been that the Bank of England has had so many of its powers removed.\"</p> <p>Former business secretary John Hutton said the scale and depth of the economic conditions Britain was facing were \"unprecedented\". He told BBC1's Politics Show: \"In the past when we've had economic downturns, the problem has either been an inflationary problem, maybe our industries have not adapted enough and we haven't seen investment going in. This is a problem that has been festering in the financial markets for a while; it's now spilling out into the real economy.\"</p> <p>The pressure for further cuts in interest rates came amid mounting evidence that the global turmoil is far from over.</p> <p>Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, warned yesterday that the danger of banking collapses was far from over. Kuwait's central bank stepped in yesterday to support Gulf Bank, which has been hit by derivative trading losses. Gulf stockmarkets fell sharply, with the Qatar and Oman indices down more than 8% and Dubai down 5.53%.</p> <p>Steinbr\u00fcck told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper: \"Any all-clear signal would be false. I can't mislead our citizens and say we've got everything under control.\" The government's \u20ac500bn (\u00a3400bn) rescue package ran until the end of 2009 and would certainly be needed until then.</p> <p>His comments came as the heads of two of Germany's biggest regional banks, WestLB and HSH Nordbank, indicated they would also draw on the package. Bayern LB, which faces losses of \u20ac3bn, last week sought a \u20ac6.4bn capital injection and, according to Spiegel magazine, may have to ask the government to take on a bigger share of the bail-out than foreseen.</p> <p>KBC, the largely Flemish bank, was said to be in talks yesterday with Belgium's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Didier Reynders, about a \u20ac3.5bn state injection. The bank warned on October 15 it had made net losses in the third quarter of up to \u20ac930m, after writing off \u20ac1.6bn of its structured products portfolio. It insisted then that it had no need to follow the example of two of its Belgian peers, Fortis and Dexia, and demand a bail-out.</p> <p>Results yesterday from Aluminium Corp of China underlined the impact of the credit crunch on the global economy. The world's third-largest alumina producer said its quarterly earnings fell 92%.</p> <p>As China's largest producer of the metal tries to stabilise prices and cut costs, it has reduced its aluminium capacity by 18% and alumina by 10%. Analysts say that is not enough to shore up prices of aluminium, widely used in the slumping construction and automobile industries.</p> <p>The governor of the central bank warned that China needed to \"confront the many destabilising and uncertain factors that exist\".</p>",
  "<p>In the crush of news around the financial crisis - and its ensuing overdose of commentary and confusion - it occurred to me that the basic building block of journalism, the article, is proving inadequate. We need its next generation. </p> <p>The story has been all we've ever had - what would fit on to a newspaper page or into a news show. But discrete stories delivered over days cannot adequately cover the complex news going on now. A series of articles conveys to each of us, depending on our knowledge, too much or too little information, too much repetition or too little explanation. The knowledge is not cumulative. Each instance is necessarily short-lived and shallow. </p> <p>Deeper articles - big packages with graphics, series, special sections - are attempts to solve the problem, but they often only exacerbate it, giving us more to read or more to miss. We can't catch up. We don't get smarter. The article perpetuates a Groundhog Day kind of journalism.</p> <p>Online, we have so many more means to present and explain news. News becomes a process more than a product. We can stretch the timetable so that news need not expire into chip paper after a day. News can be updated, corrected, expanded, discussed, linked. So what is that essential unit of news, post-article?</p> <p>In an insightful essay six years ago, Meg Hourihan, the co-creator of Blogger, wrote that the atomic unit of media was no longer the publication, section, page or article but the blog post: a nugget of information or opinion with its own permanent address. </p> <p>These countless carbon atoms can be connected to others to become molecules of discussion and intelligence. But that alone won't work as an organising principle for informing a world. Single posts, videos, Wikipedia entries or search results may be new building blocks of media, but we need order atop them. </p> <p>We have many tools to work with now, first and foremost the link. The link can take us to more or less background, depending on how much each of us needs, to original source material and to many perspectives. The link becomes as important as the brand in news. </p> <p>Some of the best explanatory journalism of the financial crisis has come from unexpected sources - in the UK, an unusual live edition of Peter Day's In Business on BBC Radio 4; in the US, the narrative radio show This American Life (and a spin-off podcast, Planet Money). Neither is known for covering breaking business news. They could be discovered not because we were drawn to their brands but because listeners linked to them. </p> <p>Still, we need magnetic poles to gather news around and organise it. If not the article or brand or the happy coincidence of links, then what? I think that the new unit of journalism needs to be the topic. Newspaper sites do have topic pages, but they are usually just lists of their own headlines and sometimes others', intended to serve not only readers but Google's search engine optimisation. </p> <p>Those topic pages are still inadequate. I want a page, a site, a something that is created, curated, edited and discussed. It will include articles. But it's also a blog that treats a topic as an ongoing and cumulative process of learning, digging, correcting, asking, answering. It's a wiki that keeps a snapshot of the latest knowledge and background. It's an aggregator that provides curated and annotated links to experts, coverage from elsewhere, a mix of opinion and source material. Finally, it's a discussion that doesn't just blather but tries to add value. It's collaborative and distributed and open but organised.</p> <p>Think of it as being inside a beat reporter's head, while also sitting at a table with all the experts who inform that reporter. Everyone there can hear and answer questions asked from the rest of the room - and in front of them all are links to more and ever-better information.</p> <p>It's not an article, a story, a section, a bureau, a paper, a show, a search engine. It's something new. What do we call it? The topic table? The beat bliki (ouch)? The news brain? I don't know. We'll know what to call it when we see it.</p> <p>\u00b7 Jeff Jarvis is a journalism professor at the City University of New York and blogs at buzzmachine.com</p>",
  "<p>Firms that receive foreign cash and donate to political parties are to face much tougher scrutiny from the independent watchdog, the Electoral Commission, under the political parties and elections bill, which is now going through parliament.</p> <p>The new powers will allow the commission to question all donors, from individuals to companies, in any future investigation. At present the law only allows investigators to question political parties receiving the cash rather than the donors themselves, unless the commission passes an investigation to the police.</p> <p>The move comes as the Conservative party faces allegations that it took tens of thousands of pounds from an associate of a Ukrainian oligarch and accepted a \u00a31m loan from a dormant company owned and run by Lady Victoria de Rothschild, a member of the banking family.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed on Saturday that Robert Shetler-Jones, a British associate of Dmitry Firtash, has been funding the office of Pauline Neville-Jones, the shadow security minister. Shetler-Jones also funds Conservative Central Office through Scythian Ltd, which he chairs and part-owns. It has been described as a \"non-trading company\" and its accounts are overdue. </p> <p>The firm's position had already caused concern to the commission because non-trading companies cannot give donations to political parties, although the Conservatives produced a letter from its auditors saying it was still trading.</p> <p>The Observer revealed yesterday that a \u00a31m loan was given to the Conservative party by Ironmade Ltd, which is owned and controlled by Lady Victoria de Rothschild. According to the newspaper, Ironmade was set up to avoid her identity being revealed. The loan is due to be repaid in 2010.</p> <p>The Labour MP Denis MacShane accused the Conservative leader, David Cameron, of showing \"contempt for British democracy's rules\" by not ending the arrangement.</p> <p>But a party spokesman said: \"This loan was taken out prior to the 2006 Electoral Administration Act, which has since set out new rules governing the way political parties can borrow. The loan is fully declared to the Electoral Commission and entirely permissible under the rules as they stood at the time, and remains fully permissible now.\"</p> <p>The new powers for the Electoral Commission could signal a much tougher attitude to a number of firms that donate to the Tory party, including Bearwood Corporate Services, the company that donates millions of pounds on behalf of Lord Ashcroft, the deputy chairman of the party, and Scythian Ltd. </p> <p>At present the commission is relying on assurances from the Conservatives that neither company is using foreign cash to fund the party. Under the new powers, the commission could send in forensic accountants to question company directors about the origin of the donations.</p> <p>The closing of this loophole could lead to other changes. Officials have been asked by Jack Straw, the justice secretary, to look at tightening other rules on foreign donations before the bill receives line-by-line scrutiny in the Commons later this year. He will seek consensus with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats before making changes.</p> <p>The interest in tougher rules has been heightened by the recent spate of stories about foreign oligarchs meeting top figures in the Conservative party. </p> <p>Last week, George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, denied allegations from his old friend Nathaniel Rothschild that he had solicited a donation from Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch, on his yacht off Corfu.</p>",

The leader of the ceremony said: \"Although we know and are confident that she is in heaven, yet we grieve and share with Gayle's mother and Gayle's sister and Gayle's family the pain, the almost unbearable pain, that they now feel at the loss of their lovely daughter.\" </p> <p>The speaker lashed out at her killers: \"It is hard to see this as anything other than a cowardly act that brings shame on the people who carried out this murder. And it brings shame and guilt on those that inspired them to do it.\" </p> <p>The Taliban released a statement shortly after the attack claiming responsibility and declaring that Williams had been targeted for preaching Christianity.</p> <p>One of Williams's colleagues from Serve (Serving Emergency Relief and Vocational Enterprises), which has since suspended operations in Afghanistan, said: \"She was a joyful and courageous woman. We lost a dear co-worker and we loved her.\" </p> <p>A friend told the congregation Williams had not feared death and had frequently discussed the dangers of being in Afghanistan: \"If something happens to me I will go to be with the Lord,\" she had said. \"These bodies are only temporary. When I get to heaven I will have a new body.\" </p> <p>The mourner said Williams had dreamed of being an RAF pilot and loved \"action and adventure\", adding: \"In a nutshell, she loved freedom. She disliked being restricted and controlled.\" </p> <p>The attack on Giles and Bresler was witnessed by Naseer Nadir, who cleans windshields at the adjacent traffic lights. </p> <p>\"I watched as a man pulled up in his pick-up truck. He got out and started arguing with the security guard outside the offices, then he shot the guard three times in the chest,\" said Nadir. </p> <p>\"The foreigners arrived and he opened fire on them. Then the police attacked and I took cover, so I don't know what happened after that.\" </p> <p>An officer with the NDS, Afghanistan's secret police, who asked not to be named, said the man had been a former employee at the DHL office and had come to collect his belongings. </p> <p>Thirteen arrests, including DHL guards and employees, were made, according to an interior ministry spokesman who said it was not yet clear who was behind the shooting or why it had happened. </p> <p>A Taliban spokesman said the group was not involved.</p>",
  "<p>The government is to announce tomorrow that it will include rapidly growing aviation and shipping emissions in Britain's commitment to curb its carbon footprint by 80% by 2050.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, will bow to pressure from environmentalists and rebel Labour MPs by announcing he will accept an amendment to include these emission sources in the climate change bill which is due to become law next month.</p> <p>The decision not to include aviation and shipping, which account for 7.5% of all emissions, was seen as a gaping hole in the government's legislation, which is the first measure of its kind in the world. Up to 86 MPs threatened to back an amendment in the Commons tomorrow, tabled by Elliot Morley, a former environment minister, to include these sources. </p> <p>The government has not been able to calculate exactly which emissions from international flights and shipping lanes will be attributable to Britain's carbon footprint. But even if an international agreement is not reached, acceptance of the amendment will force Miliband to explain where Britain stands on curbing aviation and shipping emissions.</p> <p>Environmentalists were delighted with the decision. Friends of the Earth executive director Andy Atkins said: \"The final piece of the jigsaw is in place. The world's first climate change law will also be a world-class climate change law. </p> <p>\"The climate change law is a victory in the fight against climate change and a victory for the hundreds of thousands of people who have campaigned to make this happen. People from right around the UK demanded a strong law. The government have listened.\" </p> <p>Thom Yorke, Radiohead frontman and supporter of The Big Ask, a campaign to urge the government to take the strongest line possible on climate change, said: \"It is a massive step forward for us all, as now we can engage in trying to fight climate change directly as a nation. And it came about simply because hundreds of thousands of people on the ground hassled their MP, who in turn hassled the government. Amazing.\"</p> <p>An attempt to kickstart the green motoring industry by spending millions of pounds of public money on environmentally friendly vehicles is also to be unveiled tomorrow. Geoff Hoon, the transport secretary, will announce that some local councils and other public bodies will be given \u00a320m to buy and run electric vans. </p> <p>He will also provide details of a full-scale trial of electric cars and convenient charging points, first announced by Gordon Brown in the summer. The prime minister has championed electric cars but so far take-up has been tiny - just 0.1% of vehicles on the roads.</p>",
  "<p>Bridget Prentice, the justice minister, did her best to try to allay fears that sharia law on family disputes was worming itself into English law, or was being given the status of an acceptable parallel system of law. In a written parliamentary answer last week, she stressed that \"sharia law has no jurisdiction in England and Wales and there is no intention to change this position. Similarly, we do not accommodate any other religious legal system in this country's laws.\" </p> <p>This was a wholly correct statement but it did not satisfy her critics. The issue was whether or not a family dispute settled under sharia law - for instance about children - could be recognised under English law. To which Prentice's answer was: Yes, provided it was formally approved by a family judge applying English family law. \"If parties to a judgment in a sharia council wish to have this recognised by English authorities, they are at liberty to draft a consent order embodying the terms of the agreement and submit it to an English court.\"</p> <p>So far, so sensible. It was her next sentence that caused me problems. \"This allows English judges to scrutinise it to ensure that it complies with English legal tenets.\" She must mean, even though she didn't say it, that the judges would and should refuse to give the force of English law to an agreement reached under sharia procedures unless it conformed to English principles - which would crucially include that the parties to the dispute, husband and wife, had equality of negotiating power. To put it bluntly, that the woman had not been unduly pressurised into agreeing to the settlement and that her rights, as understood under English law, had been protected. </p> <p>Contrary to the way the media have presented the issue, the English courts should not just rubber-stamp the sharia agreement or ruling. But how can the courts be expected to inquire into every sharia consent form to ensure that it \"complies with English legal tenets\"? </p> <p>Judges will have before them, perhaps on only two pages, the terms of the agreement reached between husband and wife. They will not know how it was reached. The document will not tell them whether the woman's consent was freely given. Will the judges start digging into the background of the negotiations, or into a sharia council's ruling, to make sure they were not unjustly skewed in favour of the man? They're not equipped for that. So how can they be satisfied that the court order they've been asked to make complies with English law, as Prentice asserted would be necessary? The answer is that they can't. </p> <p>The Ministry of Justice has been told to cut its budget by \u00a3950m by 2011, and there are justifiable fears that this will inevitably mean substantial job losses, a reduction in court services leading to a diminished standard of justice, and more cuts to legal aid, already a system in crisis delivering less and less access to justice to those in need. Yet the government seems determined to press on with its madcap, wildly expensive and unnecessary plan to build three Titan prisons in which to place thousands of criminals who ought not to be in prison in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>Old hands talk of a Middle Eastern version of Murphy's law: what can go wrong, does - and usually at the worst possible moment. Tzipi Livni's failure to form a new coalition led by her Kadima party shows it is at work again.</p> <p>Confirmation of early elections in Israel follows several developments that had generated cautious optimism: one is the likelihood that Barack Obama will be the next US president and will make good on his pledge to prioritise talks to resolve the world's most intractable conflict.</p> <p>Another is renewed interest in the 2002 Arab peace initiative that offers Israel normal relations with all Arab states if - and that remains a very big \"if\" - it can reach a just settlement with the Palestinians. </p> <p>The third positive element has been the repeated readiness of Syria to pursue negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights - one of the reasons its foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, is meeting his British counterpart, David Miliband, in London today.</p> <p>The reason Livni's failure casts such a dark cloud is that polls consistently show the frontrunner in the election is Binyamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud opposition. </p> <p>Netanyahu, who like Livni would have to form a coalition with other parties, does not believe in the sort of peace with the Palestinians that Kadima and its Labour party ally are prepared, in principle at least, to agree to. </p> <p>The Likud will resist any re-partition of Jerusalem, a key issue for Palestinians. Netanyahu opposed the 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and calls for economic development for the Palestinian Authority before negotiations over territory. Ideologically, the Likud is close to the thousands of Israeli settlers who would have to be evacuated if a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians could be cobbled together.</p> <p>Netanyahu's approach, with his emphasis on fighting \"terror\", contrasts with the swelling chorus of mainstream Arab and Israeli voices warning that time for a two-state solution is running out. Indeed, many believe it has already gone.</p> <p>But Israel's tangled internal politics are not the only problem. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is also in a desperately weak position. </p> <p>Hamas warns it will cease recognition of Abbas as president after next January, when his term is due to end. Abbas does not want new elections until 2010. Egypt is trying to broker a compromise between the factions, but hopes of success are slim.</p> <p>A Palestinian spokesman says Israel's turbulent domestic politics are its internal affair, and insists the PA is committed to negotiations with whoever is in charge. But no one doubts that a focus on elections - whatever the outcome - is bad news for an already near-moribund peace process.</p> <p>As the Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said from Gaza City yesterday: \"The call for early elections and Livni's failure to form a coalition government is a slap in the face to those who still dream of negotiations.\"</p>",
  "<p>Under current legislation it is illegal to resell tickets for football matches - for public order reasons - and the Olympics. Under the terms and conditions of most ticket sales, there is a clause reserving the right to refuse entry if the ticket is resold. This is rarely exercised, partly because it is not clear whether the clause is enforceable in law. </p> <p>Part of the industry consultation will cover a new model set of terms and conditions. </p> <p>Following a series of high-profile cases, the government also struck a voluntary agreement with eBay and other ticketing sites to prevent the resale of tickets to free events such as Live8 and Radio 1's One Big Weekend.</p> <p>Some events, such as Glastonbury, have introduced their own measures to ensure that tickets cannot be resold for profit.</p> <p>But the government has also recognised that public attitudes to the resale of tickets have become more complex, with many consumers taking advantage of the web to buy and sell tickets while at the same time decrying organised touting.</p>",
  "<p>Football is always a game of risk but this Wear-Tyne derby was suffused with some exceptional gambles. None seemed bigger or backfired more than the decision to enforce minimal segregation between rival supporters - except, perhaps, the failure to offer Joey Barton greater protection when the Newcastle United substitute, and black sheep, warmed up.</p> <p>So 29 arrests were made on a day which ended with a number of home fans spilling on to the pitch before scuffling with a small group of Toon Army rivals. Outside the stadium a police horse suffered minor burns when a moron threw a firework. Earlier a man was arrested for escaping the stands and taunting Shay Given after the goalkeeper's concession of the winner, a stunning free-kick from Kieran Richardson. Meanwhile Barton was showered by missiles and spittle as he limbered up.</p> <p>The controversial midfielder attracted censure as well as sympathy for brazenly kissing the Newcastle badge on his tracksuit after a policeman advised him to restrict his stretching exercises to the technical area. Significantly, the infinitely more mature Given admitted he felt tempted to retaliate. \"A few idiots came on to the pitch near me after Richardson's goal,\" he explained. \"It was unsavoury and I got abuse. It was hard to keep my temper. It got close to something happening. You feel low enough after conceding the goal, so the last thing you want is some idiot roaring abuse in your face.\"</p> <p>The Football Association has launched an inquiry and is threatening lifetime bans. Nonetheless, ugly as certain moments were, things could hardly be said to have descended into 1970s-style anarchy. Chief Superintendent Neil Mackay of Northumbria Police, whose force has launched its own inquiry, reflected: \"The vast majority of fans were well behaved, 29 arrests out a capacity crowd is low.\"</p> <p>Similarly Sunderland's chairman, Niall Quinn, emphasised the bigger picture after Newcastle's first defeat on Wearside for 28 years. \"Saturday was a fantastic day,\" he said. \"A minority should not spoil it.\"</p> <p>It is understood his club will not face FA sanctions. Indeed Sunderland - who, having sold the game out, could not leave banks of empty seats between rival fans - suggested the local constabulary might have been culpable. \"There were 500 police on duty, segregation is a matter for them,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>The FA was more anxious to deter future offenders than apportion blame. \"We will make sure that anyone involved in the unsavoury scenes feels the full weight of the law,\" said its spokesman, Adrian Bevington. \"That could mean a lifetime banning order.\"</p> <p>As for the day's gamblers, the home manager Roy Keane did best. With the score 1-1 after 57 minutes he withdrew Dwight Yorke, his impressive midfielder, introduced Kenwyne Jones and switched from 4-5-1 to 4-4-2. Newly rehabilitated following a serious knee injury, the half-fit striker unnerved Newcastle's defence and helped El Hadji Diouf win the dead-ball chance from which Richardson struck the unstoppable winner over the wall and into the top corner.</p> <p>Sunderland had led on 20 minutes when Djibril Ciss\u00e9 lashed Steed Malbranque's cross-shot beyond Given but slack marking from the otherwise excellent Anton Ferdinand soon permitted Shola Ameobi to head Joe Kinnear's side level following Geremi's free-kick. Ferdinand was far from the only notable in a game where Malbranque, Richardson, Ciss\u00e9, Diouf and Pascal Chimbonda all shone, and the latter three celebrated on the pitch long after the final whistle.</p> <p>\"They've plugged into what we're all about,\" said Keane of the trio. \"Every signing is a risk but I've not found them hard at all. I've signed other people who I'd have bet my life would have done well but, within a week, I'm thinking 'You're not for me'.\"</p> <p>Kinnear insists his side are not doomed. \"There's no chance we can go down,\" the club's interim manager said. \"We have too much quality.\" Famous last words.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Kieran Richardson (Sunderland)</p> <h2>Season's flashpoints</h2> <p><strong>Aston Villa v Portsmouth</strong> October 18</p> <p>A Villa fan behind the dug-out hurls a 50p coin at Harry Redknapp, missing the Portsmouth manager but winging the referee's assistant, Phil Sharp.

  "<p>Paula Radcliffe yesterday produced arguably her most dominant performance for more than three years when she won the Bupa Great South Run. And rain, not pain, proved the only barrier to another world record. Ten weeks after her disappointment at the Olympic Games in Beijing, when she finished 23rd in the marathon, Britain's finest distance runner was unstoppable.</p> <p>Radcliffe broke the British 10-mile record with a dominant front-running display in an ideal warm-up for the defence of her New York marathon title on Sunday. The 34-year-old won in 51min 11sec, missing out on the world record by 21sec, but knowing she will head to the United States with her confidence restored.</p> <p>\"Sometimes at the end of a race you feel really sick when you have given everything but I don't feel that,\" said Radcliffe. \"That is good, that I can run a decent time and feel there is more left in the tank. I am really pleased.\"</p> <p>A second mile of 4:57 blew the field apart, even though it looked to her like she had run even quicker; the marker had been put in the wrong place and she could not work her own watch. But Radcliffe quickly took the lead in her first race since Beijing and was never challenged. Portugal's Jessica Augusto was second in 53:15, with Magdalene Mukunzi, of Kenya, runner-up in the Great North Run at the start of the month, third in 53:18.</p> <p>Radcliffe's frustration in Beijing was her curtailed training because of a femur stress fracture but she arrived on the south coast on the back of more than two months of the type of mileage that has made her the marathon record-holder.</p> <p>\"The only thing to recover from in Beijing was that I wasn't in enough shape because I hadn't done enough running,\" she said. \"I felt a lot different on the start line [today] because you know you've done enough preparation. It feels more normal now, in Beijing it wasn't. Generally I would not put myself on the line unless I was OK.</p> <p>\"With the problems I have had, really since I have had Isla [her daughter] it has been stop-start. I have not raced anywhere near as much as I want to do.\"</p> <p>Not since she won the marathon at the world championships in Helsinki in the summer of 2005 has Radcliffe controlled a race in this manner. Even though she won in New York a year ago she had to fend off the challenge of the Ethiopian Gete Wami. Yesterday Radcliffe was on course to threaten the world record held by the Kenyan-born Dutch runner Lornah Kiplagat, but strong winds and rain prevented her from bettering that time.</p> <p>Radcliffe, however, looked powerful, and rarely wavered thanks to the strength she has built in her thighs. She was waving to the crowd within an instant of crossing the line and barely looked out of breath in beating Jill Boltz's 17-year-old British record by half a minute. \"To be honest I don't know what the world record is,\" said Radcliffe. \"I did not want to hammer it.\"</p> <p>There is enough time for that in New York. She will race through the city's five boroughs more with excitement than pressure. \"I want to get on with it,\" she said. \"It's worse pressure when you know you haven't done the preparation and it's out of your control. In any marathon build-up there are always niggles. Any marathon runner will tell you that.\"</p> <p>In Beijing Radcliffe had more than that when a calf injury came on during the race. But yesterday, on a gloomy morning on the south coast, her smile told a far brighter story.</p>",
  "<p>The afternoon started badly for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/harlequinsru\">Quins</a> with their young wings Seb Stegmann and Charlie Amesbury bumping into each other as they ran on to the field. Otherwise, though, Dean Richards' young side were not exactly falling over themselves to reach the last four of this competition and it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/londonirish\">London Irish</a> who will contest a place in the last four with the Ospreys at Reading next Sunday. </p> <p>Quins' gamble with playing a virtual second team at the Ospreys in this Anglo-Welsh cup three weeks earlier almost paid off with only a late James Hook conversion handing the holders victory. Quins have some of the most talented young players in England and, as Amesbury ran in their second try after a flowing move to help them take a 12-0 lead in the first quarter of an hour, it looked as though revenge was on the cards for last month's comeback victory here by Irish in the Premiership. </p> <p>\"Little bit of deja vu, wasn't it?\" said Irish's head coach Toby Booth, however, after three tries in nine minutes in the third quarter turned the game on its head again. Booth had given Shane Geraghty his first start at fly-half this season. The 22-year-old's run of injuries may have put him behind Danny Cipriani and Toby Flood in the pecking order of young England playmakers in the past year but Geraghty could well be appearing across the road for the senior side next month. </p> <p>\"He helped give us some control and he's getting back to where he used to be,\" said Booth of the fly-half who has recovered from a shoulder injury and, in front of England's new backs coach Brian Smith, showed some of his old attacking qualities, as demonstrated by his part in the first of Peter Hewat's tries that helped bring Irish back into the game. </p> <p>Smith, of course, knows all about Geraghty, having left Irish in the summer to take up his England role. Like Mike Catt, Geraghty's mentor and now the attack coach at Irish, the young player is equally at home at inside-centre and could play that role alongside Cipriani when the Pacific Islanders visit Twickenham on Saturday week. But if he is not picked in England's 22 for that game he will be a key figure against the Ospreys next Sunday. </p> <p>Inside Geraghty for much of the second half the replacement scrum-half Alfredo Lalanne helped up the tempo and provide a winning service for the Irish backs. The 25-year-old arrived from his Buenos Aires club, San Isidro, only last Wednesday and spent about 45 minutes training with his new team-mates. Lalanne will stay for the season as cover for Paul Hodgson and Peter Richards, who may be on international duty. He looks a useful acquisition. </p> <p>Quins' Argentinian, the tubby prop Ignacio Elosu, made a less worthy contribution as a replacement.

  "<p>Sergio Garc\u00eda dedicated his first European Tour win since 2005 to Seve Ballesteros after victory in the Castell\u00f3 Masters on the course he played as a boy.</p> <p>The 28-year-old, hosting the inaugural event at the Club de Campo del Mediterr\u00e1neo, where his father is still the professional, closed with a four-under-par 67 to finish three shots ahead of Sweden's Peter Hedblom (66) and five clear of Alexander Noren (65).</p> <p>\"I couldn't help but think about Seve,\" said Garc\u00eda. \"I'm sending all my love to him and his family and hope he recovers soon. I hope this victory helps him to get a little better.\" Ballesteros, 51, is seriously ill in hospital following three operations for a brain tumour. </p> <p>Having taken a four-shot lead into the final round after scores of 66, 65 and 66, Garc\u00eda held off the strong challenge of Hedblom, the only player who threatened to spoil the fairy-tale story when he opened the round with four successive birdies. But he never got ahead of Garc\u00eda, who used his knowledge of every part of the course to complete a memorable seventh European Tour victory and move from fifth to third in the world rankings, overtaking Vijay Singh and Padraig Harrington who drop to fourth and fifth place respectively.</p> <p>The Englishmen David Lynn and Simon Dyson were tied for second overnight alongside Hedblom and Dane Soren Kjeldsen, but failed to close the gap and ended up joint fourth after rounds of 69.</p> <p>\"I didn't play amazing and when Peter had such a great start I thought these guys were not making it easy for me,\" Garc\u00eda said. \"On the back nine I felt I had it under control and had a lot of chances and putts but didn't make that many.</p> <p>\"It just feels very special and means so much. Just getting the tournament here was special for me and my family but to play the way I did and win it is awesome.\"</p> <p>Garc\u00eda birdied the first hole to move to 17 under overall but Hedblom also birdied to keep the leader close, and then reined the Spaniard back in with three more birdies to narrow the gap to just one shot. </p> <p>At the par-three 6th, Garc\u00eda missed the green from the tee and had a tricky chip which he failed to get up and down, while Hedblom sank a simple putt for par to draw level on 16 under. Garc\u00eda responded with a birdie at the 7th, holing a putt from eight feet following an excellent approach shot to regain the outright lead, and extended that advantage with a birdie on the 8th. When Hedblom bogeyed the 17th to fall three shots behind it was all but over.</p> <p>Kevin Sutherland had a one-stroke lead after the third round of the Frys.com Open. Sutherland fired seven birdies for a seven-under-par 63 at Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona to improve to 14-under 196 after 54 holes, one stroke clear of George McNeill.</p> <p>McNeill signed for a four-under 66 and is at 13-under 197, with Paul Goydos (66), John Mallinger (66) and Steve Allan (68) a further shot back in a tie for third.</p> <p>Arron Oberholser entered the third round atop the leaderboard but is four strokes back at 10-under after a one-over-par 71.</p>",
  "<p>Every police force in the UK is to be equipped with mobile fingerprint scanners - handheld devices that allow police to carry out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/idcards\">identity checks</a> on people in the street.</p> <p>The new technology, which ultimately may be able to receive pictures of suspects, is likely to be in widespread use within 18 months. Tens of thousands of sets - as compact as BlackBerry smartphones - are expected to be distributed.</p> <p>The police claim the scheme, called Project Midas, will transform the speed of criminal investigations. A similar, heavier machine has been tested during limited trials with motorway patrols.</p> <p>To address fears about mass surveillance and random searches, the police insist fingerprints taken by the scanners will not be stored or added to databases.</p> <p>Liberty, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/civilliberties\">civil rights</a> group, cautioned that the law required fingerprints taken in such circumstances to be deleted after use. Gareth Crossman, Liberty's policy director, said: \"Saving time with new technology could help police performance but officers must make absolutely certain that they take fingerprints only when they suspect an individual of an offence and can't establish his identity.\"</p> <p>Details of the type of equipment and the scope of its use have been revealed in a presentation by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA).</p> <p>The initial phase of the Mobile Identification At Scene (Midas) project, costed at \u00a330m-\u00a340m, will enable officers to perform rapid checks on the fingerprints of people arrested or detained. The marks will be compared against records on Ident1, the national police database which holds information on 7.5 million individuals.</p> <p>Geoff Whitaker, a senior technology officer with the NPIA, told the Biometrics 2008 conference that Project Midas would save enormous amounts of police time and reduce the number of wrongful arrests.</p> <p>At present, officers have to take suspects to custody suites if they need to check fingerprints. On average, the agency's research shows, the procedure takes 67 minutes. \"If we scaled this [saving] up to the national level that would equate to 366 additional police officers on the beat,\" Whitaker said. \"One of the benefits is that it will reduce the number of errors - and we can reduce the number of arrests significantly.</p> <p>\"There's a huge range of opportunities [for] mobile ID. It could be used on the deceased at the scene of a crime, on suspects for intelligence in the early part of an investigation, [or even] in a mortuary.\"</p> <p>Policing of big public occasions, sporting events, festivals, political conferences - as a well as immigration and border controls - could benefit from the equipment, he suggested.</p> <p>\"Another use is for prisoners in transit; it's not uncommon for prisoners to swap identities on the way to prison,\" he said.</p> <p>Project Midas, he said, would give the police \"a full, mobile national capability\" to check identities. </p> <p>The system is being designed to have the capacity to beam images of suspects back to officers on the streets to help confirm identifications. Some US police forces are already using the technology. </p> <p>\"The return of mugshots [to officers],\" Whitaker added, \"is something we would like to do.\"</p> <p>The tender document for Midas states: \"Bidders' solutions ... should include, but may not be limited to, fingerprint identification capability.\" Plans for a police Facial Images National Database (Find) were suspended last year but are being reviewed. </p> <p>One of the companies bidding for the Midas contract, Northrop Grumman, told the Guardian: \"A lot of the hand-held [devices] we are considering have cameras so they can support fingerprint and facial images\".</p> <p>A limited trial of mobile police fingerprint devices, called Project Lantern, started in 2006. About 200 have been distributed and 30,000 checks performed. They were deployed in police cars using automatic number plate recognition technology - stopping vehicles that were logged as stolen, having no insurance, no MOT or simply unknown.</p> <p>\"The aim was to deny criminals the use of the roads,\" said Whitaker. \"Around 60% of drivers stopped gave false identification details.\" </p> <p>Fingerprint checks often showed they were carrying falsified documents. </p> <p>The electronic searches, encrypted and sent over public networks, were usually returned to the mobile devices within two minutes; 97% of searches were completed in five minutes. Responses are graded as \"high\" or \"medium\". If high, it shows the system is confident of a match; if medium, it could display up to three potential identities. The returned data includes the name, age and gender of the suspect if there is a match.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the NPIA added: \"It will be up to each police authority to assess the benefits and see how many they want. Early indications are that the benefits will be huge.\"</p> <p>Thomas Smith, an officer from the Los Angeles police department, also briefed the Biometrics 2008 conference on the success of his force's mobile ID devices which send images and fingerprint matches back to officers on the street. He said they had become so powerful that once the machines were produced some suspects admitted they were lying about their identity. </p> <p>\"Our next thing will be facial recognition [computerised matching of suspects from their faces] in the field,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>It certainly sounds suspect. Many reading our story today about how police nationwide will get hand-held fingerprint scanners in order to carry out spot identity checks doubtless felt their hackles rise. Coming from the government of 42 days, of the national ID-card scheme, of the ever-growing DNA database, surely this is yet another scheme to erode civil liberties?</p> <p>Not yet, although it is easy to see why some privacy campaigners are alarmed by the prospect of tens of thousands of police armed with BlackBerry-sized devices that enable them to check people's identities. There are, however, two important safeguards that should give some reassurance. The first is the legal requirement that fingerprints collected by patrols will not be stored on any database. The second is the assurance that Project Midas, as it is known, will not be linked with the national ID card scheme. Defenders point out that the police have long had the right to take fingerprints at the police station; these new devices simply make it easier to collect and check them on the beat. A criminal driver may lie about his identity, but these devices will catch him out in under five minutes.</p> <p>As it is planned, this scheme is on the right side of the line between policing and snooping. If Midas does not turn whatever we touch into permanent evidence, those concerned about civil liberties should not demur from its being extended nationally. But they should also be on guard for any encroachment of the system. What if police take the fingerprints, or the mugshot, of an armed man who then runs away? It is quite easy to see how situations like that may give rise to lobbying for evidence to be kept. It is also easy to imagine a government administering a national ID-card scheme arguing that storage of roadside identification would be a good weapon in the war against terror. These are only niggling worries, but many will have them. That is indicative of how much damage this government has done to its reputation as a respecter of civil liberties. </p> <p>Just before leaving office, Tony Blair wrote: \"We have chosen as a society to put the civil liberties of the suspect ... first.\" While not as gung-ho, Gordon Brown has not publicly disavowed that sentiment, or removed the legislation that embodied it. The result is an ever-expanding pile of threats to our liberties. Mobile fingerprinting could be combined with the stop and search powers granted under the Terrorism Act 2000 to become a licence to hassle. To guard against that, the police must give numbers and ethnic breakdown of those stopped under this new system. And ministers need to commit not to extend the scheme. Good policing, after all, relies on the trust of those policed.</p>",
  "<p>Let cravats be loosened and bustles be unconfined. Last night, the nation's remotes tingled with nostalgic glee as BBC1 debuted its lavish, 14-part production of Little Dorrit. Adapted from Dickens' novel by Andrew Davies, and stuffed to the ruffles with a characteristically diverse selection of actorly talent (Alun Armstrong, Bill Paterson and Ruth Jones, among others), it is to be broadcast - like Davies' wildly successful 2005 adaptation of Bleak House - in twice-weekly, half-hour instalments, the better to foster a lather of soapy intrigue.</p> <p>The latest trinket to be tugged from TV's bottomless ottoman of expensive costume dramas, Little Dorrit follows in the slipper-steps of Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Sense and Sensibility, Lark Rise to Candleford and Cranford. But what is it about the genre that enchants us? And what makes the perfect costume drama? Here are the ingredients vital to TV's most beloved genre. </p> <h2>Pedigree</h2> <p>Nothing screams \"best actor in a mini-series or motion picture made for television\" like a knight of the realm saying prithee in a barouche. It indicates nobility, patriotism and a healthy respect for tradition. Little wonder then that the costume drama has long been catnip to the sort of actor whose jowls tingle at the sight of INT. SCENE: Drawing room, morning. Disraeli enters, choking slightly on toast. Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Eileen Atkins, and now, in Little Dorrit, Sir Tom Courtenay and Robert Hardy CBE - they follow the costume drama's lavender vapour trail like the flat-capped urchins in the Bisto ad. Coincidentally, potential costume drama types might like to note that the flat cap is an invaluable aid in one's quest for accolades. As are parasols, neckerchiefs, proximity to gratuitous expanses of untamed rustic beauty and/or Bob Hoskins. Toss a pair of tights into the equation and you'll be sobbing your way through your TV Quick acceptance speech before Michaelmas. </p> <h2>Topicality</h2> <p>One of the reasons costume dramas continue to draw vast audiences is because of their unfailing ability to reflect the \"modern condition\". Social snobbery? Have a slice of Vanity Fair. The interminable pursuit of status? Feel the width of this Austen. The costume drama's themes should be as universal as its corsets are boned.</p> <p>\"It's universal, isn't it?\" you might have found yourself thinking last night during the bit when Jeremiah Flintwich (Alun Armstrong) cackled madly while dumping a bunch of Mrs Clennam's incriminating paperwork on the fire. All the debt and financial-guilt stuff offers a </p> <p>startlingly prescient nod to our current financially hazardous state. And if you scrunch up your eyes, Mr Merdle (Anton Lesser) even looks a bit like Robert Peston. Be it roaring Georgian melodrama or quivering Victorian bonnet-tugger, the period drama should elicit the same exclamation: why, beneath all that lace and diction, \"they\" are just like \"us\"! </p> <h2>Costumes</h2> <p>The ruffled blouse, the dainty lace glove, the buffed-to-a-dazzle monocle: these are instant visual signifiers for the nostalgia fan while simultaneously reminding the viewer that he/she is not watching Setanta Lunchtime Live.</p> <p>Britches represent breeding, unyielding political views and, if excessively close-fitting, sexual subjugation. Shapeless smocks denote either virginity or social inferiority. Bonnets - from the Regency coal scuttle to the floppy Georgian numbers - are so intrinsically linked with the costume drama that the merest whiff of a floral brim is enough to send certain sections of the viewing public (men) dashing over to Channel Five. Size is everything: sweet-natured Amy Dorrit's (Claire Foy) bonnet is so enormous her face resembles a tiny, freckled train emerging from an imposing wicker tunnel. This signifies confusion, innocence and something clever about the Industrial Revolution, although we're not entirely sure what. </p> <h2>Andrew Davies </h2> <p>Since 1994 the scriptwriter has been responsible for no fewer than 13 period adaptations, including Emma, Vanity Fair, Bleak House and the definitive, \"wet Firth\" version of Pride and Prejudice. Having forged the modern costume drama template with his winking, light-footed Middlemarch, his influence has loosened the stays of a previously stuffy genre, jazzing it up by means of wit, lashings of sauce and the odd burst of distinctly un-vintage lingo. Last night, for instance, comedy French murderer Rigaud (Andy Serkis) sheltered in a bush while wrinkling his prosthetic nose at \"zeez poxeee weatherrr\". Would a 19th-century comedy French murderer really have said such a thing? Probably not. But Davies' talent is to make the incongruous accessible. It's not difficult to imagine him penning his adaptations in a drawing room in some stately townhouse, sipping brandy as he bashes out a gag involving a parson and a faulty bicycle seat before leaning over to pinch the bottom of a passing naif. Sadly, Davies lives in Kenilworth, just south of Coventry. </p> <h2>Heritage acting </h2> <p>Like the past, the costume drama is a foreign country: they act things differently there. Vocally, it's a minefield. Apostrophes evaporate. Vowels expand to fill the available space, and beyond. Consonants develop crisp, Arctic edges. Facial expressions, meanwhile, are traditionally confined to the eyebrows, where a complex series of tics and ripples can signify everything from minor vexation regarding a tipsy benefactor to the loss of a vital organ in the Crimea. This rule is waived, however, when it comes to the Character Performance (CP), where even reputable artistes replace normal acting with frantic hand gestures, gurning, scuttling/waddling, an enormous accent and/or an unusual wig, each of which is intended to signify eccentricity and hilarity as opposed to, say, bad acting. In Little Dorrit, the CP is legion, from Serkis's Rigaud and Sue Johnston's bird-like scullery grumbler Affery, to Eddie Marsan's beetling debt-collector Mr Pancks and Armstrong's Jeremiah/Ephraim Flintwinch, who barks like a dog and scrunches up his shoulders while using his eyebrows as a makeshift drawbridge. Generally speaking though, costume drama acting is about demonstrating supreme bonnet control in devastatingly posh circumstances. This is why it is known as Dench warfare. </p> <h2>Repression</h2> <p>It burbles beneath the surface of the costume drama. It is the molten sediment that underpins its every social machination. Of course, being British we prefer a vague, giggling, shortbready version of sex to actual sex, but even when the repression slips, there's something comfortingly cartoonish about the results. Fanny Hill? Benny Hill, more like, whooped viewers upon beholding BBC4s recent bumfest. And yet it is not only sexual repression that thrives within the costume drama's starched confines. For every cravat that throbs with concealed passion there are a dozen bustles twitching with aspirational yearning and a dozen more embittered spinsters clucking like battery hens in their social confinement. To wit, Little Dorrit's Mrs Clennam (Judy Parfitt), a poisonous, housebound, Havershammy widow, demanded her son not kiss her cheek but, instead, \"Touch my hand!\" This indicates her emotional frigidity, financial evasiveness and the fact that she hasn't had sex in ages.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Little Dorrit </strong>continues on Thursday, 8.30pm, BBC1</p>",
  "<p>Detectives re-examining thousands of deaths and murders in Northern Ireland's Troubles have uncovered two more cases of killings that have triggered suspicions of collusion between the security forces and paramilitary groups. </p> <p>The cases, from the early 1970s, are being investigated by dedicated groups of officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland's historical enquiries team (HET). </p> <p>Allegations of collusion, particularly with loyalist paramilitaries, cast a long shadow over the record of the security forces and military intelligence during the Troubles. Among the most prominent controversies were the 1989 murder of the Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane and the killing 10 years later of the Lurgan solicitor Rosemary Nelson. </p> <p>The HET was created in 2005 by Sir Hugh Orde, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, with the challenging aim of re-examining all 3,268 deaths and murders related to the Troubles between 1969 and 1998. </p> <p>Its intention is to provide answers, or some form of resolution, for bereaved families. Detectives are now focusing in on key issues and patterns of murder.</p> <p>Despite the emergence of fresh concerns about the behaviour of the security forces, the team's deputy director, Phil James, insisted the work was not about \"pointing fingers\" at the police or army. He declined to reveal specific details about either of the newly uncovered cases or how many murders were involved.</p> <p>But he told the Guardian that officers were checking old forensic evidence. \"If we think there's a realistic chance of a case,\" he said, \"if [the material has been] kept in a an appropriate way with the labels signed, even if it's 40 years old we will try.\"</p> <p>Around 20 groups of cases have become the focus of detailed studies as the HET works its way through its process of cold case reviews.</p> <p>Among subjects receiving specific attention for which a Senior Investigating Officer has been appointed to coordinate related cases are:</p> <p>\u2022 Murders committed by the Ulster Volunteer Force's 'Glenanne gang' in the mid-1970s. As many as 87 deaths \u2013 including bombings in Dublin and Monaghan - have been linked to this paramilitary unit which allegedly included past and serving members of the RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment.</p> <p>\u2022 Scores of self-styled 'executions' carried out by the IRA's internal security and punishment squads. The exposure of one of the so-called 'Nutting Squad's' leaders as the military intelligence agent 'Stakeknife' has raised questions about who directed the killings.</p> <p>\u2022 The activities of loyalist paramilitary killers who were also Special Branch informants. This inquiry has been called Operation Stafford and has grown out of the Police Ombudsman's inquiry last year into the 1997 murder by the Ulster Volunteer Force of Raymond McCord in north Belfast. </p> <p>As well as examining the state's alleged role, detectives are focusing on aspects of the IRA's campaigns:</p> <p>\u2022 The Provisionals' use of 'proxy' or 'human bombs' where kidnap victims were forced to drive devices into army checkpoints: five soldiers and a civilian worker were killed at the Coshquin border post in 1990.</p> <p>\u2022 Shootings by the vigilante organisation Direct Action Against Drugs that killed as many as 11 supposed drug dealers during the 1990s. The IRA always denied that DAAD was a cover name for its gunmen.</p> <p>Several of these groupings are being handled by the HET's 'White Team' which specialises in collusion cases. Its officers, some with experience of war crimes inquiries in Bosnia, are from forces other than the RUC or PSNI. A number of its detectives operate out of a London office and have taken over responsibility for the residue of cases investigated by Lord Stevens in the last of his three enquiries. Lord Stevens retains oversight of his inquiries.</p> <p>After three years' work, detectives are now re-opening cases from 1973/4 and are around a third of the way through total fatalities. Phil James admitted that the original schedule of reviewing every Troubles killing by 2011 would not be met. \"It will take a few more years than that,\" he said, \"probably two years\". </p> <p>The process could be complicated if responsibility for the task is transferred from the PSNI to a new truth and reconciliation-style commission examining the legacy of the past. A report by the former Church of Ireland archbishop, Lord Robin Eames and Denis Bradley, is expected soon.</p> <p>Phil James is confident the Historical Enquiries Team's work will continue. \"We believe the HET is independent. If [any new commission] delivered confidence around enhanced independence, but we didn't lose access to the materials we have, I could sit comfortably with that,\" he said. </p> <p>James insists he has been given access to any documents and information he has requested: \"We have sought information about agents and informers \u2026 If [agents] have been inappropriately used we will investigate. If someone is acting correctly within the law they are entitled [to] protection. But if they were engaged in significant criminality there's no protection for them.\"</p> <p>HET detectives have interviewed former members of the security forces, witnesses and suspects. They have carried out test-firings on weapons and commissioned forensic tests. </p> <p>Asked whether they had approached any politicians, James said: \"As we go forward there may be cases when we will consider that. We will go where the evidence takes us. If the evidence is there we will do it.\"</p> <p>Republican groups have pressed the HET to search for evidence, in particular, of what they believe was high-level security force collusion in killings associated with the UVF's Glenanne gang in the mid-1970s. Several RUC officers were subsequently convicted of participation in gun and bomb attacks.</p> <p>James said: \"The first examinations of a number of Glenanne cases are complete and work is now ongoing with a holistic approach, examining allegations of collusion and at what level.\" </p> <p>Much of the HET's work involves liaising with families of the bereaved. Some welcome the re-opening of cases, others do not want painful memories revived. </p> <p>\"Sometimes families split into factions: some grateful, some resentful [of our findings],\" James said. \"Some change their minds. Some families want to forget.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the sun rose over Soweto on South Africa's first democratic election in 1994, the Mwale family were too busy with practical matters to ponder the historical resonance of the day.</p> <p>Following rumours that a white supremacist group was going to poison the main water tank, they boiled the water and cooked a huge pot of mealies. The day before, during early voting, granny had waited seven hours to cast her ballot for Nelson Mandela and the kids had to bring her food. Now it would be granny's turn to come to the rescue.</p> <p>I recall walking with the mother of the house, Esther Mwale, in silence at 7am through zone 9 of Meadowlands, the morning fog slowly lifting to reveal that people had ironed their best trousers and put on their sturdiest shoes for the day. All dressed up for democracy.</p> <p>The two hours Esther spent queueing to vote somehow served as a dignified, humane response to the horrors of apartheid. After his wife, Ruth First, was killed by the regime, African National Congress militant Joe Slovo said: \"The most effective punishment is to force those who did it to live in a democratic South Africa.\" And here it was.</p> <p>But if long lines of black people at polling stations showed the promise of a fledgling democracy in South Africa, the prospect of similar scenes next week will illustrate a failing democracy in the US. A longstanding, systematic, legal and political campaign to suppress the vote in Democratic areas combined with the shambolic, shameful neglect of the electoral infrastructure could yet cause chaos on an unprecedented scale. </p> <p>In short, come next Tuesday, the issue may not so much be who votes for whom, but who gets to vote and whose votes get counted. A recent CNN poll showed that 42% of voters are not confident their vote will be accurately cast and counted - almost three times the figure four years ago. With the record numbers of newly registered voters will be a record number of lawyers on both sides. If it's close, the courts may once again pick the winner.</p> <p>The popular response to such an unpopular outcome is not difficult to imagine. According to the Washington magazine The Hill, police across the country are preparing for unrest. Swat teams will be on standby in Oakland, California. The Democratic secretary of state in Ohio now has protection from death threats after she refused to make a list of 200,000 newly registered voters available to Republicans.</p> <p>Some of this mayhem stems from a noxious blend of officiousness and incompetence. In Jackson County, West Virginia, people have been hitting the touch-screen for Barack Obama and finding they have voted for John McCain. In Florida they are testdriving the third ballot system in three election cycles. Election workers are struggling. Those who thought they would vote early and avoid the queues are waiting in line for three hours. </p> <p>Added to the technological flaws with machines and lack of technical training for those operating them are technocratic electoral laws that aren't fair, don't work and in any case aren't being heeded. According to the New York Times, tens of thousands of eligible voters in six battleground states have been illegally removed from voter rolls or will be prevented from voting in ways that violate federal law. In Wisconsin, one in five voters' names on the registration database did not completely match names on other state records, including four of the six former judges charged with overseeing the elections. Both presidential candidates may have been wasting their time wooing Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher - aka Joe the plumber - at the last debate. He is registered as Worzelbacher, and therefore may find himself ineligible to vote. </p> <p>While this is happening everywhere (Jackson county is 98% white and voted for Bush in the last two elections), it is compounded by a protracted Republican effort to disenfranchise Democratic voters under the guise of combating voter fraud. Voter fraud is a serious issue. The trouble is it barely exists. In the six years since the Bush administration has made it a priority, barely 100 people have been convicted and fewer than 200 have been charged. The overwhelming majority were either people who thought they were eligible but weren't (immigrants, felons etc) or those registering fictitious people. </p> <p>\"If they found a single case of a conspiracy to affect the outcome of a Congressional election or a statewide election, that would be significant,\" Richard Hasen, election law expert at the Loyola Law School, told the New York Times last year. \"But what we see is isolated, small-scale activities that often have not shown any kind of criminal intent.\"</p> <p>But that hasn't stopped Republicans trying. Five of the 12 US attorneys who were fired last year, in the scandal that led to the resignation of US attorney general Alberto Gonzales, were axed because they refused to pursue the issue of voter fraud with sufficient vigour. It also explains the Republican attacks on the community group Acorn, which pays people to register voters in low income and minority areas. Some of Acorn's workers made up names. That should be and has been condemned. But there is no evidence that it has resulted in a single fraudulent vote ever being cast since Acorn began its large-scale voter registration drives four years ago. </p> <p>While attempts at voter suppression are partisan in intent they are racial in effect. The Democrats have not won an election without the black vote since 1964. The most effective and crude way to undermine their base is to minimise the vote in black areas. This is precisely what happened in Florida in 2000, where Republicans lowered the threshold for inclusion on the \"purge list\" of ineligible voters. By the time they were done, African-Americans accounted for 88% of those purged, even though they only comprised 11% of the actual electorate. </p> <p>The practical consequences of this interference, manipulation and, at times, intimidation is twofold. It disenfranchises people who either don't have the time, inclination or wherewithal to stand up to officialdom. And it creates huge lines while others stay and fight. A Democratic party survey from 2004 found half of the state's African-American voters in Ohio reported some problems at the polls on election day. On average, black voters waited in longer lines than whites, were more likely to be asked for identification when they got there and felt more intimidated. </p> <p>This year will be worse. Obama's strategy has hinged on registering huge numbers of new voters. Overrepresented among them are the black, the young and first-time voters. For at least six months this eventuality has been predictable. And yet electoral officers around the country have declared themselves entirely unprepared. Just as in South Africa 14 years ago, the huge turnout we are seeing in early voting, and which will undoubtedly come on election day, marks a celebration of a historic moment in the nation's democracy. But the long lines and their demographic composition will mark not dignity but disorganisation and discrimination.</p> <p>It remains one of the paradoxes of this election that black America may yet get a president before black Americans have fully secured their right to vote.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 27 2008.

  "<p>It was just another routine Friday call to a \"senior source\" in the Conservative party. Government and polling contacts had been tapped; now it was time for the opposition and it's always best to start at the top or near as dammit. After a brief exchange of gossip came the revelation. Unprompted, Peter Mandelson had forensically dissected Gordon Brown's character and style of government in unflattering terms over a dinner table abroad with the leading member of the opposition best able to use the information.</p> <p>Readers want the authentic conversation of the top table from political columnists, especially in Sunday newspapers. If you are too discreet you become a member of \"the media class\", rightly pilloried by Peter Oborne and others for entering into a conspiracy with the politicians against the public. If you are reckless with confidences, however, the well of information dries up. Then you are forced to fall back on private judgment and experience. That takes you only so far.</p> <p>As the deputy editor of the Sunday Times, a paper used to pushing others for maximum impact, I'm painfully aware that I need to get the timing right. To publish or not to publish that week, which was before the Tory conference? The source may be persuaded to give the green light but, remember, a few weeks ago Mandelson was \"only\" European trade commissioner, always good copy but no longer a frontline player in British politics. However, Labour contacts indicated that the prime minister was trying to woo a senior \"Blairite\" enemy back into cabinet. Meanwhile, the Tories were simultaneously sending out signals to senior ministers, such as Lord Adonis, that they would be welcome in their new order come election time. </p> <p>Mandelson's indiscretions, seen in that context, were therefore doubly intriguing. So I took the risk of sitting on the story for a few weeks while hoping the Prince of Darkness advanced up the pecking order of news. </p> <p>Then, two weeks ago and beyond our wildest expectations, the prime minister invites his old frenemy back into government. Mandelson, now the business secretary, boasts in a newspaper interview on Saturday of being \"joined at the hip\" with Gordon Brown. Three oranges on the slot machine and huge relief at my end.</p> <p>Time to ring the senior source again. He repeats the story more vividly. What's that, you say: \"he poured pure poison about Brown into your ears\"? Oh, and Mandelson advised that the government was extremely vulnerable over indebtedness, did he? That was a key theme of the Conservative party conference, which was repeated in David Cameron's attacks on Brown at prime minister's questions.</p> <p>The editor of the Sunday Times, John Witherow, and I discuss the make-up of the front page, keeping faithful to my bargain with the source, but knowing that stories about who was holidaying with whom on Corfu that summer will mean that anonymity is a polite fiction. But the question is, politeness to whom? That will eventually emerge when Nat Rothschild writes to the Times.</p> <p>George Osborne's television appearance the following day and Mandelson's warning that further revelations would prompt retaliation against the shadow chancellor whet our appetites for more. </p> <p>An investigation is already in motion at the Sunday Times. As soon as Mandelson was re-appointed to the cabinet, Charles Hymas, managing editor, news, set his team the task of establishing whether there was anything during his time as a commissioner that might call into question his suitability as business secretary.</p> <p>The impetus for our investigation was not from any leaks from the Tories. It is in Mandelson's interest to claim he was the victim of briefings from the other side. We meet with obfuscating - if not misleading - statements from official spokesmen, but that's par for the course. One of our chief investigative reporters, Jon Ungoed-Thomas, and our Brussels correspondent, Nicci Smith, begin reviewing all Mandelson's key decisions while commissioner. At the same time our reporters check his social contacts for conflicts of interest. </p> <p>One person of particular interest was the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, whom we understood to be someone Mandelson had met socially. We knew he had met him over the summer for drinks on his yacht, the Queen K, but a spokesman for Mandelson had said that that was the extent of any hospitality - which on the face of it did not raise any potential conflicts of interest. However, we made further inquiries and were told by a reliable source that Mandelson had actually stayed on the yacht. We went back to the spokesman, who said that \"as far as I am aware\" he had only been on the yacht for drinks, but would not confirm or deny whether he stayed on the yacht.</p> <p>In light of this lack of clarity and our information from a reliable source, we considered there might be a possible conflict of interest in decisions involving Deripaska. Smith undertook a forensic trawl of all EC decisions or documents that might affect Deripaska's businesses. Two emerged - one was a decision to exempt one of his companies from aluminium tariffs, taken before Mandelson became a commissioner, the second involved a proposal by Mandelson's department to cut tariffs on aluminium.</p> <p>Clearly, there was a potential conflict of interest, given Mandelson's meetings with Deripaska. There is no register of hospitality for commissioners. </p> <p>We go for it a second week. Comment is relatively cheap, news is expensive. Nobody at the Sunday Times underestimates the power of a good feature: but old-fashioned scoops are the red meat on which we feed.</p> <p>The following week, we widen our investigation and discover more about hospitality that Mandelson had received from Nat Rothschild and possible conflicts of interest over Mittal Steel, which benefited from key EC decisions. We establish that Rothschild had provided Mandelson with far more hospitality than previously known, as well as unpicking the investments that his hedge fund had in companies that had been involved in European business. And of course we were back on the case yesterday.</p> <p>Rothschild explodes at being dragged into a newspaper investigation. He writes his infamous letter to the Times in not one but three versions, as m'learned friend takes a view.</p> <p>Witherow and I meet to discuss developments and lament: \"Why couldn't the rich young devil have written to complain to us - it's our newspaper that did it to him.\" Far from being in league with the Times in these matters, we'd rather chew our right arm off than voluntarily give our sister paper (or any paper) a scoop. </p> <p>The best scoops have small beginnings. However long you've been in journalism, it's unravelling the thread that's the biggest thrill of all.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission has given leading players in the \u00a3380tn derivatives market until the end of the year to come up with \"concrete proposals\" to reduce the risks these complex products pose to the financial system.</p> <p>Charlie McCreevy, the EU internal market commissioner, is pressing the industry to agree to central clearing for credit default swaps (CDSs), the instruments viewed as being at the core of the financial turmoil.</p> <p>This emerged from high-level talks last week between the EC and bankers, regulators, investors and exchanges, including the London Investment Banking Association and the futures exchange LIFFE.</p> <p>The industry was due late last week to submit a list of nominees to a new working party, chaired by the EC, that is to hold its first meeting early next month. McCreevy warned the industry he would introduce legislation to enforce his plans if it failed to act in time.</p> <p>The Irish commissioner, who is an avowed supporter of free markets and reluctant to regulate, has been forced to intervene because of pressure from governments and MEPs. He is also due to announce plans to regulate credit-rating agencies on November 12.</p> <p>Pushed by EU member leaders including Gordon Brown, he wants to clamp down on over-the-counter derivatives traded off-exchange - particularly CDSs, which account for 10% of all derivatives trades, or \u00a338tn.</p> <p>Industry representatives have indicated they will accept centralised clearing, with Eurex, the derivatives arm of Germany's Deutsche B\u00f6rse, saying it was open to creating a consortium with CDS users.</p> <p>McCreevy has also called for a systematic investigation of the derivatives market in the wake of the financial turmoil, with the working party due to report to him by April.</p> <p>His moves come as the US government and the New York state attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, have launched their own investigation into the CDS market - specifically whether it was illegally manipulated.</p> <p>The swaps, ostensibly designed to provide insurance against a company defaulting on its debt, are seen as the heart of a speculative market. When AIG, the US insurer, wrote down $11bn (\u00a36.9bn) of its CDS holdings, it was bailed out by the government with an $85bn loan.</p> <p>The US's leading banks reportedly hold $13tn of CDSs. McCreevy says regulators have little sight of potential liabilities that could build up and the opacity of these instruments \"leads to nasty surprises when things go wrong\".</p>",
  "<p>Hello subscribers! Let me just say straight off that nowhere in this mailout, nor anywhere on my website (www.benlagenlive.com) do I have a bad word to say about Nat Rothschild. I don't even know him that well. In fact I have barely spoken to him since our Bullingdon days, and I should stress that I wasn't even a proper member of the dining club. I was briefly their mascot (a position which was permanently retired after the trip to casualty), but I don't think he would recognise me without my papier mache dog's head. Still, a great bloke.</p> <p>You may have read somewhere last week that blogging is \"over\", but you certainly won't have read it on my blog, because I don't believe it for a minute, and also because I haven't updated my blog for two weeks (other commitments). The announcement that \"real\" blogs have been killed off by paid journalists and marketing campaigns, is to say the least, premature.

  "<h2>IMF chief keeps his job after 'error of judgment'</h2> <p>The head of the International Monetary Fund will remain in his job after the agency's executive board concluded that there was no cause for dismissal over his affair with a former IMF employee. The board issued a statement on Saturday saying that the actions of managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn were \"regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment\". However, the 24-member board of directors decided that the relationship had been consensual and did not involve any type of sexual harassment, favouritism or any abuse of authority.<br><strong>Associated Press in Washington</strong></p> <h2>Eight-year ordeal ends as troops free Farc hostage</h2> <p>A former Colombian politician abducted eight years ago by leftwing Farc rebels has been freed in a military operation. Authorities announced that Oscar Tulio Lizcano, 62, who was abducted in August 2000, was rescued yesterday in western Choco province. Henry Murillo, a government official of Caldas province, confirmed the ex-Conservative party member's release. Lizcano's wife, Martha, called his captivity \"eight years of great suffering\".

The two - a civil servant and his teacher wife - allegedly solicited other couples over the internet and invited them to their home, said the officials. They allegedly held at least three such sex parties and police are looking for others involved. Sex out of wedlock is illegal in Egypt, where Islamic law is the main source of legislation. Police say the couple used chat rooms on an Arabic porn website to arrange for interviews with couples before they swapped partners.<br><strong>Associated Press in Cairo</strong></p>",
  "<p>The tiny, pathetic figure dangling by a noose from the branches was missed by the eagle-eyed men whose job was to search patches of dense shrubbery for such outrages. And so, on November 12 1980, in an image worthy of the Chapman Brothers, Rupert Bear met a hideous fate in the columns of his own newspaper.</p> <p>An unexpectedly dark side of Giles - the Leonardo of the January sales, the boat show and the bank holiday traffic jam, who was voted the nation's favourite cartoonist in 2000 - will emerge in an exhibition drawn from the enormous archive he left after his death.</p> <p>As well as chronicling in microscopic detail the life and times of The Family, headed by the monstrous Grandma - drinker, gambler and admirer of the death penalty, public flogging and Lenin - Giles worked in the second world war for the Ministry of Information, and then was briefly a war artist, or rather official \"war cartoonist\" for the Express newspaper, and was haunted for the rest of his life by the scenes he saw in Nazi death camps.</p> <p>He created striking images of the by then deserted Breendonck transit camp in Belgium, but was so shocked by Belsen - which had been liberated but was still full of corpses and skeletal living inmates when he arrived - that he was unable to draw anything.</p> <p>In the British Cartoon Archive at the University of Kent, where the Giles family has placed a collection including 6,000 original drawings, thousands of prints and scores of crates of books, photographs, cuttings from magazines and papers and memorabilia, there is a Nazi dagger.</p> <p>To the great relief of the director, Nicholas Hiley, the Luger which went with it was destroyed with the rest of Giles's large gun collection after his death in 1995.</p> <p>Both were presented to him by Josef Kramer, who had been in charge of the gas chambers at Auschwitz - and who greatly disconcerted Giles when they met by greeting him as a fan. He asked Giles to send an original cartoon, and presented the pistol, dagger and swastika armband in return. \"Fortunately,\" wrote Giles later, \"he was hanged so I didn't have to send it.\"</p> <p>His first job as resident cartoonist was for the leftwing Reynolds News, and the archive reveals his guilt at abandoning it for the rightwing Sunday Express: \"They stuck a cigar in my face,\" he explained. He never agreed with the Express's politics, but it made him rich: by 1955 he was being paid \u00a38,060 for three cartoons a week and on one occasion, walking back from a good lunch with the proprietor, was invited to choose a car as they walked past a Rolls-Royce showroom.</p> <p>\"Once he became one of Beaverbrook's gang, he was in a class of his own,\" Hiley said. \"He was certainly earning two or three times as much as any other cartoonist of his day.\"</p> <p>He got his revenge in jokes like poor slaughtered Rupert Bear - who was also executed by firing squad, and ripped apart by the Family's dog, in cartoons published in 1971. Giles stayed away from the office as much as possible, never attended news conferences, and never submitted drafts of cartoons: they arrived, on or just after the deadline, by taxi from his studio in Ipswich. Subeditors were standing by ready to scour the backgrounds, particularly densely shaded patches or foliage, for obscene outlines or other audacities, and inevitably some got through.</p> <p>\"I think it was part of his lifelong challenging of authority figures,\" Hiley said. \"He liked to think he was just against petty authoritarians, but I think the truth is he hated any authority figures. When the gasman calls and Grandma lays into him with her umbrella - that's Giles.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong> Giles, One of the Family, including previously unseen images from the archive, is at the Cartoon Museum in London from November 5. From November 8, an exhibition highlighting local scenes in his work will be held near his old studio at the Town Hall gallery in Ipswich.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Ronald Giles was born in <strong>Islington</strong>, north London, in 1916, the son of a <strong>tobacconist </strong>and a <strong>farmer's daughter</strong>. He was later to be known as Carl, the nickname colleagues awarded him for his supposed resemblance to horror film actor <strong>Boris Karloff</strong>. Educated at the local Barnsbury Park school, Giles left at 14 and trained as a stable hand, but worked as a <strong>pavement artist </strong>in <strong>Brighton </strong>and an office boy for a Wardour Street <strong>film company </strong>before being promoted to junior animator on cartoons. The closest he came to a formal art training, he pointed out, was the encouragement he received from <strong>Sir Alfred Munnings</strong>, president of the Royal Academy, who employed his uncle as a <strong>butler</strong>. In 1935 he began working for director and producer <strong>Alexander Korda </strong>on the first full-length British colour cartoon film with sound, <strong>The Fox Hunt</strong>, and got his job on <strong>Reynolds News </strong>two years later.</p>",
  "<p>Israel looked set last night for an early general election after the prime minister designate, Tzipi Livni, failed to broker a deal with the religious right and form a new coalition government .</p> <p>Livni, who replaced Ehud Olmert as leader of the dominant centrist Kadima party last month, visited Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and urged him to call a new poll.</p> <p>\"I'm sick of this extortion. We'll see all these heroes in 90 days,\" Livni is quoted as telling her advisers after refusing to yield to the demands of the religious right.</p> <p>A new election and the prospect of a victory for the rightwing Likud party could completely derail peace talks with the Palestinians as well as wider Middle East negotiations.</p> <p>Livni called on Peres after a rollercoaster day of last-ditch attempts to salvage the negotiations. \"When it became clear that everyone and every party was exploiting the opportunity to make demands that were economically and diplomatically illegitimate, I decided to call off [talks] and go to elections,\" she said.</p> <p>Peres has up to three days to decide how to resolve the leadership crisis, which began on Israel's 60th birthday earlier this year when it was revealed that police were investigating Olmert for fraud.</p> <p>The president is expected to yield to Livni's call and schedule an election to be held in 90 days, instead of November 2010, and even then it could take several more weeks for the new prime minister elect to form a viable coalition government.</p> <p>Alternatively, Peres can appoint another parliamentary leader who he believes could form a stable government within four weeks, but this is unlikely as Livni, the leader of the party with the biggest parliamentary majority, was the most likely to succeed.</p> <p>Livni's failure to broker a deal with the religious right, in particular Shas, which was demanding massive increases to child allowances and a guarantee that the government would not give up east Jerusalem, conquered by Israel in 1967, has left the nation in a political limbo.</p> <p>As a leader tainted by corruption, Olmert's mandate to act on behalf of the nation has been greatly diminished, yet he could remain at the helm for at least three more months - and possibly five - until a new coalition government can be formed.</p> <p>As a result, Olmert told the cabinet yesterday that when the winter session of parliament opens today, he will not outline a political agenda for the future as expected. \"In the current circumstances, this would be incorrect. Therefore, I will make short remarks on socioeconomic issues and not those which certainly stand at the base of serious disagreements among the Israeli public,\" he said.</p> <p>The US-backed peace talks with the Palestinians and the back-channel talks with Syria, via Turkey, are two such divisive national issues that are expected to grind to a halt.</p> <p>But while Olmert is powerless to act on such issues - especially after the parliament passed a law earlier this year requiring a referendum or a two-thirds parliamentary majority for Israel to sign a peace deal involving territorial concessions - he faces growing political unrest and threats of violence from Jewish ultra-nationalists, Palestinian in-fighting in the West Bank and an increasingly independent, self-funding Hamas regime in Gaza.</p> <p>Jewish ultra-nationalists again clashed with Israeli soldiers and police on the weekend after the government ordered the demolition of an illegal outpost. Settlers from Kiryat Arba, a settlement near the Palestinian city of Hebron also rampaged through a Palestinian village, smashing windows and vandalising graves.</p>",
  "<p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is to signal a more punitive approach to prisons today by attacking the \"criminal justice lobby\" for putting the needs of offenders before those of victims.</p> <p>In a speech on prison policy to the Royal Society of Arts, he is to say it is time to reclaim the \"unfashionable\" language of punishment and reform and make clear that the justice system is there to serve victims and the law-abiding majority first.</p> <p>Using such language is not a return to Victorian notions of dealing with crime, nor does it mean treating offenders inhumanely, he will say, claiming that penal reformers have retreated into a \"fog of platitudes\" about offenders and have forgotten about victims.</p> <p>Straw's more punitive tone comes after Gordon Brown's party conference promise to appoint a victims' commissioner, and at a time when prison chiefs are trying to cope with an inmate population of 83,383 in England and Wales. A recent fall in the use of short-term sentences by the courts means no prisoners are now being held in emergency police cells.</p> <p>Straw will challenge the \"criminal justice lobby\" to do more to put victims at the heart of their work, to recognise that being a victim of crime is one of the most traumatic things that can happen. He will suggest that the victims' commissioner will give victims of crime a stronger voice in government and in the community.</p> <p>Although the words \"punishment\" and \"reform\" may have grown unfashionable, there is a need to reclaim them, Straw will say: \"Two simple words: it's time we had them back. Punishment and reform is the very basis of the criminal justice system ... The sentences of the court are first and foremost for the punishment of those who have broken ... society's rules.\"</p> <p>The word \"reform\" implies an obligation on the part the offender to make amends: \"Yes, the criminal justice system needs to give people a chance to turn their lives around, but these chances should be balanced by a responsibility on the offender to take them. To use such language to describe the government's approach does not signal a return to some Victorian notion of crime. And this doesn't mean treating offenders inhumanely.\"</p> <p>In an advanced text of his speech, Straw praises the \"criminal justice lobby\", but raises concerns that it has retreated into a language of its own. He will explain that phrases such as \"criminogenic needs of offenders\" drive him to distraction, not only because they are impenetrable jargon, but because they imply that someone's amoral desire to continue criminal activity is equal to the needs of victims.</p> <p>He will say: \"We hear far less often from these lobbies about the needs of the victim. I think they sometimes forgot who the victim is, so lost do they become in a fog of platitudes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every fortnight for the past five months, I have found myself standing in a living room in south London, quacking like an angry duck, meowing like a cat, whining like a dog, baaing like a sheep, and nagging like a witch. I've pretended I'm Carmen Miranda, a Smurf and a bored robot. I've wailed like a baby while pointing my chin up at the ceiling and holding my tongue between thumb and forefinger. I've beaten my chest and made creaking-door sounds. When Laura Zakian asks me, \"Have we done 'going up sniffy mother-in-law, going down twang'?\" the answer is yes.</p> <p>I met Zakian a year ago when, somewhat ill-advisedly, I auditioned for a jazz-singing course. I liked her because she was bossy and forthright. Turns out she's also a pretty good teacher. She had to be: my voice is not exactly a jazz voice. I'm a soprano, for starters, and a mixture of requiems, evensong and a term singing choral music in French and German at university has produced a voice that's high, clear and polite. My Miss Otis Regrets came out as if I'd suddenly become a lady-in-waiting to the Queen. \"It's terribly smart,\" said Zakian, amused. </p> <p>Part of jazz's impact comes from the sense of being directly spoken to, though that, as Zakian puts it, \"doesn't mean speaking it\", but rather using elements more associated with your speaking voice. It turns out I had no \"speech quality\" at all. Any idea that I could make the transition from choirgirl to jazz singer in six weeks was dispelled in that first lesson. We would have to start from scratch, entirely retooling my vocal cords. </p> <p>There are, say laryngologists, two modes for the voice. The first is thick-fold, or chest voice: the voice that most of us speak in, where the vocal cords are relaxed and thick, producing a richer sound, up to what is called the first passagio, the note at which they start to stretch and thin. For women, this is usually at the D flat above middle C. The second mode is called, unsurprisingly, thin-fold. \"That's fine if you're doing classical singing,\" says Zakian. But in pop and jazz, the idea is to get a more mixed sound over the passagio, blending it so that there is no break, while staying in speech quality. Because I'm used to the upper register, I simply don't have the vocal musculature required to take thick-fold higher. My vocal cords just flop, making a sound like a teenage boy's voice cracking. It feels like an elastic band twanging in my throat. </p> <p>Singing takes all of you. That's what makes it so joyful - and so exasperating. The lessons prove incredibly physical, all about pelvic floors, hormonal cycles, tongues, spines and breath. You can sound different depending on how you stand, or how you tilt your head. And the voice is a barometer of psychological weather: tension is obvious; happiness lifts a voice; depression can take it away altogether. Self-consciousness strangles it, so you have to be vulnerable, relaxed - but in control. It's a tricky balance. As for training the voice, I quickly learned that musical comprehension happens on various levels: intellectual, which is straightforward enough; and physical, which is a whole other thing, achieved through practice and a kind of unconscious coaxing. Will a delicate muscle to work and the chances are it will promptly disobey. </p> <p>Hence my introduction to what Zakian calls \"the department of funny noises\", designed to improve flexibility and strength, and develop speech quality. It's like doing press-ups: we're training muscles, even if we can't see or feel them much. In our first lesson, Zakian said I \"might see a difference in three months - your voice won't change if you don't practise on a daily basis\". Daily practice combined with a full-time job is a bit of a pipe dream for me, though. Some weeks I manage three hour-long sessions, others none at all. It feels frustrating and pointless. But then one day my voice just feels different, as though all the gubbins in my throat have suddenly got the point.</p> <p>Another absolute fundamental in jazz, of course, is swing. While it is possible to say, as Zakian does, that \"the underlying feel is one of triplets with the first two crotchets tied and the third accented a little to give you swing quavers\", the fact is that there is a kind of alchemy involved, an unconscious understanding you only really get from listening to jazz all your life. Though she doesn't spell it out, I am not, it is fair to say, her most apt pupil. I didn't grow up listening to jazz and never thought about rhythm much, even in 10 years of piano lessons; trying to understand how someone might \"push the quavers a lot, or sit back on them\" defeats me. The fact that a professional jazz singer is expected to name a groove for the band, who will then launch into, say, a cut-time funk version of Love For Sale, I find incomprehensible. But it's also true that when I stop listening so hard, and over-thinking, and beating myself up because I've counted wrong, and just feel, things go a lot better. And singing songs like Shiny Stockings, by Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Foster, make you swing despite yourself.</p> <p>I am a great deal happier with phrasing and melodic improvisation. Zakian's favourite jazz singer is Carmen McRae, because of the way she privileges delivering the story. \"The words are the most important thing,\" says Zakian, \"because you're a singer, and therefore a songsmith, and therefore a wordsmith. Even if you haven't written them yourself, you're interpreting the meaning of them.\" </p> <p>The composer is paramount in most classical singing: you can interpret mood and feeling, but you have to follow, accurately, both the melody and the tempo written on the page. In jazz, what's on the page is the starting point. It's a performer's art, and the performance changes every time. Which sounds brilliant - licence to do whatever you like - but, of course, it's not quite that simple. You have to learn a language, of what works and what doesn't, and then you have to make it second nature. \"It's like any language,\" says Zakian. \"You choose which words to use, but you're not going to go through a sentence saying, 'Well, I've used a preposition and a verb followed by a conjunction, so now I'll use a noun.' You have to have the vocabulary in your head.\"</p> <p>And so we learn octave displacement, in which you sing a note at the octave below or above the one written (a favourite Ella Fitzgerald trick); passing notes, in which you touch on notes between two written notes (\"typically jazz - they give a bit more rhythmic agitation\"); and melisma, in which you take a syllable and bend it through various notes before proceeding (you have to be careful with this, or it can go a bit Mariah Carey). We try inverting the melodic line, a bit of anticipation, a bit of delay, a bit of silence, a bit of a lick (a short melodic motif). </p> <p>For a little inspiration, I go to see Claire Martin and Anita Wardell at Ronnie Scott's, and the amazing Christine Tobin at the Pizza Express Jazz Club in Soho, appreciating their nifty ways with chromatics. We try a bit of that, too, climbing up through semi-tones to see where I end up. Doing too much of it makes me sound like a drunk warbling in a shower, but used sparingly, it makes for lovely light and shade.</p> <p>Finally, it's time to put it all together, in a rendition of Rodgers and Hart's My Funny Valentine, which seems straightforward enough - except that putting it all together, and making it sound natural and easy, is a bit like rubbing your stomach, patting your head, tap-dancing, doing yoga and having an intimate conversation, all at the same time. At least I don't have to think too much about swing. My Funny Valentine has been performed in many ways, from Sinatra's croon, to Fitzgerald's lush version with violins, to Sarah Vaughan's exploration of most of her four octaves, but no one really messes much with the tempo.</p> <p>Everything else about it is hard enough, though. I've discovered a pleasingly resonant sound in my bottom register (I can now sing a low G, too), but this makes tackling the higher phrases without flipping into an operatic vibrato far more difficult. I've been practising in the key Ella sings it in, G minor, but Zakian moves me up to an A minor, which denies me some nice low notes, but makes it all sound much more integrated. </p> <p>Once I get over my attachment to how the song \"ought\" to be and make my first forays into improvisation, playing with the melodic line turns out to be a lot of fun. We decide on a Chet Baker approach, slow and fragile, then throw in octave displacements, and an inversion or two. I try a bit of chromaticism, sliding into \"unphotographable\" like a snowball descending a hillside - and encountering a tree. I'm inordinately pleased, if a bit baffled, when Zakian says: \"That's nice! Because you're getting the major 7 against the minor 7. That's really nice!\" </p> <p>But every time you think you're getting somewhere, something pops up to remind you just how far you have to go. Singing with a pianist, for example. Zakian explains: \"Because you can sing anything you like, within reason, melodically and rhythmically, if the pianist plays the melodic line for you, that's going to constrain you.\" So the pianist Chris Lee improvises away, while I have to rely \"on being able to hear the chord changes, being able to feel where the beat is\". </p> <p>It's like being sent out into a busy street blindfolded. But you just have to calm down, breathe, and listen, listen, listen. The first time I get it - when I start in the right place and end in the right place, nothing more - it feels amazing. Then, when I manage to sing with the piano, and improvise, and (mostly) stay in speech quality, well, it might not seem so to anyone else, but it feels to me as if I'm beginning to make music.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Laura Zakian</strong>'s album About Love is out on December 1.</p>",
  "<p>Just beyond Vince Cable's garden in Twickenham there is an apiary. \"I was invited to open it and, as a result, I found from beekeepers that there was a terrible problem with bee diseases.\" </p> <p>Such is the glamour gap in modern British politics: the Conservative shadow chancellor is invited to a Russian billionaire's yacht off Corfu; his Lib Dem counterpart is asked to open beehives in south-west London. </p> <p>Beekeeping has since become one of the Lib Dem deputy leader's interests, joining ballroom dancing, which he learned from his first wife, and horse riding, which he learned from his second. </p> <p>His second wife, incidentally, is one of those people who could suffer a fatal anaphylactic shock unless treated immediately following a bee sting - which must make family afternoons in the garden oddly exciting.</p> <p>But that isn't the point. Cable's point, rather, is that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, poor deluded saps, didn't understand beeconomics. \"I asked parliamentary questions about bees, first of Blair, then of Brown and they ridiculed me, saying that I wanted to spend thousands of pounds of research on bees and how this was typical of Lib Dems wanting to spend money on stupid things. I now realise their ridicule was based on incomprehension.\"</p> <p>There's a book on the table of Cable's office in Portcullis House. It's called A World Without Bees (it is written by the Guardian's Alison Benjamin and Brian McCallum) and features this terrifying passage: \"If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left. No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man.\" Didn't Labour realise that bees are probably the most economically useful creatures on earth? That apples, pears, cherries - not to mention runner beans - flourish thanks to the efforts of these unpaid workers? That billions of pounds of taxpayers' money was being wastefully poured into subsidising intensive agriculture that kills bees, but that a few thousand pounds spent on research into the mystery bee-killer disease could save millions? </p> <p>\"Then it became clear that it was a big issue and that bees are very important to agriculture due to cross-pollination.\" Cable shakes his head sadly, as if he were still an economics lecturer and Brown and Blair were underprepared undergraduates.</p> <p>It's the kind of story that Cable loves - one that ends with him implying, rather than ever vulgarly stating, that he told us so. But would anyone listen to him? Of course, not. He tells the same story about the recession. \"Unlike the Tories who just didn't see this coming and have had no convincing response, we've seen this crisis building up - the bubble of the housing market, the over-extension of households in respect of debt.\" </p> <p>And the government, too, he suggests, ill-advisedly treated him as a voice in the wilderness - before belatedly doing what he had recommended. Last year, for instance, he called for the nationalisation of Northern Rock months before Alistair Darling went ahead and did it. Cable subsequently quipped that when Goldman Sachs' bill for advice arrived in the chancellor's intray, he should have returned it saying he had received \"rather higher quality advice free of charge\" from the Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman. </p> <p>\"My team and I have been right on top of how the government should approach the problem of the banking system - first with Northern Rock and latterly with recapitalisation.\"</p> <p>With the possible exception of Robert Peston, nobody in Britain is having a better recession than Vince Cable. He's the Citizens Advice Bureau parliamentarian of the year and the House magazine opposition politician of the year. In a parliament hardly noted for memorable phrase-making, he was the man who skewered Gordon Brown in the Commons thus: \"The House has noticed the prime minister's remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean, creating chaos out of order rather than order out of chaos.\" He's the star of Newsnight's credit-crunch discussions, the go-to guy for a sagacious economics quote for broadsheets' front-page leads, the man whom Tory Alan Duncan described as \"the holy grail of economic comment these days\". He even has a Facebook appreciation society called Cable So Able. </p> <p>Why then, I ask, haven't his critical raves been feeding into a poll surge for the Lib Dems? \"Polls are volatile,\" he replies airily, \"but I think at the end of the day we will get credit for it. In a way this is the economic equivalent of the Iraq war - at the early stages of the Iraq war we got very little credit for making the right call. But when the dust settled people realised that we'd said the right thing.\"</p> <p>But isn't there a difference between saying the right thing and being in a position to act? Isn't he wasting his time in a politically impotent party at a time when he could be more of a darling as chancellor of the exchequer than the current incumbent? \"I like to think that the Liberal Democrats are working towards government. I'm not a fan of being an opposition politician just for the sake of it. You do need to focus on getting into government and on what we'd do when we get there.\" </p> <p>Isn't the truth of the matter, though, that he wielded the greatest political power aged 23 when he served as Treasury finance officer in Kenya? \"That was purely fortuitous,\" says Cable of his Kenyan experience, which lasted from 1966 to 1968. \"I arrived shortly after independence when many of the expatriates had left. To my embarrassment I had more of a say in the running of a country than I should have done. I was one of these bright young Cambridge graduates who had perhaps too high an opinion of myself. It was a fantastic experience - whether it was any good for the Kenyans I don't know.\" </p> <p>In Kenya, Cable met his first wife, Olympia Rebelo, a Kenyan Asian of Goanese origin who was not only the mother of his three children (Paul and Aida, who are in their 30s, and Hugo, who is in his early 20s) but instilled in him a still-burning passion for dancing. (It says much about politics in the internet age that many more thousands have watched YouTube footage of him dancing with Strictly Come Dancing star Alesha Dixon than have watched his analysis of the perils of Britain's personal debt burden on the same site.)</p> <p>It's worth noting that Cable doesn't deny the suggestion that he achieved his greatest political power early on. Since Kenya, he has served as special adviser to Jim Callaghan's trade secretary John Smith, as a councillor in Glasgow, chief economist at Shell, a university economics lecturer and, since 1997, as Twickenham's MP. In the early 80s he got so exasperated with Labour that he joined the SDP, a move that may have been principled but proved calamitous in terms of the greasy pole, serving to distance him further from government. Now he is deputy leader of a party whose hopes of wielding Westminster power in Cable's lifetime are surely fanciful. Is he not ambitious for more? \"I want to influence the debates - I'm very ambitious in that sense and I'm very ambitious for my party to do well.\"</p> <p>Cable is fond of quoting one of the earliest economics texts ever written, Bernard Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. \"The author had noticed that, in nature, not every creature is programmed simply to fight for survival,\" Cable wrote recently. \"Some, notably bees, also unselfishly perform a public service from which others benefit.\" True, those of a chillier temper (eg Richard Dawkins) deny this and many contend that Mandeville was actually arguing that vices such as luxury, greed and envy catalyse public benefits by encouraging enterprise, but no matter: Vince Cable takes the moral he wants, seeing virtue in being selflessly bee-like.</p> <p>\"I am ambitious but not necessarily for holding jobs. It doesn't worry me that I don't have some fancy title.\" Not even the fancy title of leader of the Lib Dems? \"There were circumstances where I would have gone for it. When my colleagues reflected on the very brutal way Ming Campbell was dealt with because of his age - there were some venomous cartoons, for example, depicting a fit, active 65-year-old with a Zimmer frame - I think some of my colleagues thought age was an issue and I was not encouraged to stand.\" Cable is fit, active and 65, but these are contemptibly ageist times. </p> <p>Instead, plausible, 41-year-old Nick Clegg became leader, with Cable - after an illustrious period as acting leader - his deputy. Some have suggested that, while Clegg is the frontman, Cable is the backroom brains of the operation. Unsurprisingly, Cable doesn't buy this. \"He's very firmly the leader of the party and I have a supporting role. I'm not hoping to usurp that in any way. There's growing recognition that he'll be an effective leader in the next general election.\" I'm not the first journalist to detect that when Cable praises his boss he often does so in the future tense.</p> <p>Here's a no-win question - would he rather win Strictly Come Dancing or be the Lib Dem leader? \"I haven't had an offer to be the latter and I haven't been invited to pursue the former,\" parries Cable. \"The serious point is that I do enjoy my dancing and I go once, perhaps twice, a week with a very good coach. It's a very good hobby and takes my mind off more pressing political things. It keeps you physically fit. Last week I did an exam and got some honours in some rather elevated grade. So it's something I love doing and it's a hobby I can pursue with my wife.\" Cable is too modest: subsequent inquiries reveal that the exam he passed is called the international supreme award two in ballroom. International! Supreme! Alistair Darling and George Osborne must look on such mighty achievements and despair.</p> <p>It's surprising Cable has time for such sidelines. \"I work incredibly hard actually, because I realise I'm part of what are a historically important series of events. I work very hard in parliament to ask more questions than a great majority of MPs. Despite the fact that many of the powers of parliament have leached away and it's actually quite difficult to change the legislation, it is possible through good questioning and the use of things like adjournment debates, to steer the public debate.\" Last week he posed parliamentary questions on special-needs education, planning regulations affecting gardens, railway services out of Waterloo and the future of the Ascension Islands. </p> <p>Why does he bother so much with parliament? After all, many of his fellow MPs don't. \"Having been elected to parliament at the age of 54, having done a variety of other careers, I was perhaps more touched merely by being a member of parliament because it's a very important job and much undervalued. I've never seen it as a route to something else. It's intrinsically important.\" Cable the selfless bee once more, doing his public duty. Or at least affecting to be.</p> <p>Cable's first wife died in 2001 after having breast cancer for 14 years. How did that affect his professional life? \"The last four [years] were very difficult. For the last two she was at home and I was caring for her. So in that first parliament, at a personal level, I was sort of hanging on. So my first priority was to help her and my other priority was to be a good local MP in Twickenham so I didn't really have time to devote to building a national profile at all. When she died, one of the ways I dealt with the situation personally was plunging totally into my political career, as a way of losing myself I suppose.\"</p> <p>In 2004, he remarried: his second wife, divorced farmer Rachel Smith, clashed with him over his defence of free trade at a New Forest meeting of Lib Dems. The erotics of Lib Dem economic debate is a topic insufficiently explored.</p> <p>Charles Kennedy, then Lib Dem leader, made him Treasury spokesman in 2003, and Cable praises him for his political courage in leading the party to oppose the Iraq war in the same year: \"It was very, very bitter. The local Tories were organising victory marches through Twickenham and we were accused of being cowards and anti-military, which was completely untrue. I think Charles Kennedy deserves a lot of credit for his leadership at that stage.\"</p> <p>And yet Cable was one of the Lib Dems who hastened to depose Kennedy because of his drink problem. When did it become apparent that he wasn't the right person to lead the party? \"The problem started to emerge after the 2005 election and later it became unmanageable.\" What did he learn from how Kennedy and Campbell were treated as they left the political limelight? \"One of the features of political life is when you're up you're up and when you're down you're down. It's pretty uncompromising and for the past year I've been up but I don't assume I'll be there for ever.\"</p> <p>But for the time being he is. And because he forecasts that the recession will be deep and long, we can expect Vince Cable will remain the much-sought holy grail of economic comment for a good while yet. \"I would love to believe this was going to be a short and shallow recession but in all honesty I don't think that's likely. The shock of the financial crisis has been absolutely massive. There is no sign yet that the banks are restoring lending. The British housing market was more overvalued than any in the western world, with the possible exception of Ireland's. There's an enormous stock of personal debt in relation to people's earnings, which is now going to have to be replaced by a build up of personal savings. All of those things mitigate against an early recovery.\" </p> <p>Any good news? \"Unemployment is cushioned by immigrant labour from eastern Europe. And there is less of a manufacturing industry from which to lose jobs.\" </p> <p>What about this buildup of savings that Cable sees as fundamental to recovery - how on earth is that going to happen in this buy-now-pay-sometime-never culture? Cable suggests it's already happening as fearful Britons re-prioritise. The problem, he argues, is that the impulse to save is effectively discouraged. \"At the moment, people who want to save for their pensions are hit by very high marginal rates of tax and the whole system of pension credit makes that problem worse. One reason I argue for a decent basic state pension linked to earnings is not simply to be nice to pensioners but to provide an incentive for people to save for themselves - if they're totally reliant on state benefits there's little incentive. Many people have been very badly scarred by bad experiences of misselling - we have had very bad episodes such as Equitable Life where people have tried to save money and have been ripped off.\"</p> <p>What can be done? Cable has known the answer for years. \"If people had access to genuine independent advice they would be much more confident about making sensible investments. I had a debate in parliament almost 10 years ago with Ruth Kelly when she was the most junior minister in the Treasury and I said then that something needed to be done to make that happen. The government just dragged its feet and did nothing.\" </p> <p>Typical. If only they had listened. But they didn't, and just look what happened. Personal debt rose exponentially, savers got ripped off and we wound up in a terrible position to face down a recession. Cable wouldn't be so vulgar or vainglorious as to say, \"I told you so.\" But he certainly wouldn't mind if you realised that he knew what had gone wrong long before his political opponents.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Audio: </strong>Listen to Vince Cable talking to Stuart Jeffries <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/politics\">theguardian.com/politics</a></p>",

  "<p>There's a lot of bleak and distressing news around at the moment. In fact, I've become so conditioned to expect bad news that if I turned on CNN tomorrow morning and saw a report saying every kitten in the world had died of leukaemia during the night, accompanied by footage of sobbing workmen bulldozing their bodies into a mass grave, I'd probably just shrug and think: \"Yeah, that figures.\" But grim though the news is, nothing of late has haunted me quite as much as a story I read some time ago - this time last year as it happens - about a man who was jailed for urinating on a woman who'd collapsed in the street, shouting \"This is YouTube material!\" as she lay dying.</p> <p>A reader reminded me of this last week. But only indirectly. I get a lot of emails from people asking me to read through stuff they've written to see if I think it's funny, or can give them advice and so on. And I rarely do, because a) some of the stuff they send is even worse than my own (in which case they must be really straining), and b) my inbox is perpetually over its size limit thanks to an endless swarm of whopping great PR emails containing 10MB JPEG invites to things I'm never, ever going to go to - so half the time I can't reply anyway.</p> <p>But during a bored moment last Thursday I bucked a trend and decided to read one such submission: a comic mock-news article a reader sent in, concerning Kerry Katona's already-notorious appearance on This Morning. Said reader called Katona a \"mentally hilarious ex-girl band jizz puppet\" and a \"pram-faced shit-muncher\". </p> <p>LOL.</p> <p>I couldn't quite work out which was worse - the fact that they'd written this in the first place, or the assumption that I, specifically, would find it funny. Having poured countless buckets of deliberately puerile abuse over people for several years, to the point where I've developed RSI, I figured I only had myself to blame. Then again, maybe not. Perhaps I'm mellowing in my old age, or perhaps I've grown 15% more human, but kicking real people when they're down doesn't really activate my chuckle cells.</p> <p>Sure enough, Katona's apparent meltdown - assuming her slurring performance was a meltdown and not, as she claimed, a reaction to antidepressants - became \"YouTube material\" within minutes of the broadcast. And although many of the comments underneath expressed concern or pity, there were plenty of cackles too. \"Haaaaaa haaaaaa haaaaaa,\" wrote one warm-hearted chum of humanity, because a simple \"Ha ha ha\" just wouldn't suffice.</p> <p>Why leave it there, chuckles? Why not head down to your nearest addiction clinic and laugh yourself up a storm? Or better still, swing by the local hospice: it's a goldmine of comic misery. Except it isn't, because those are \"innocent\" victims, none of whom have previously annoyed you by being famous, or courting attention with lad-mag photo shoots, which is, apparently, all it takes to convert basic human sympathy into side-splitting belly laughs.</p> <p>Of course, if you want to be on the receiving end of this kind of point-and-giggle shittery it helps if you're a woman, and you've had your crotch flashed across the internet courtesy of some clammy paparazzo who held his camera at ankle-height and shoved it up your skirt as you clambered out of your car. Look! When we lie down on the pavement, utterly prostrating ourselves among the dog piss and fag butts, when we lie down here and gaze upwards ... we can actually see your vagina, you repugnant! And from here on in, anything negative that happens to you has been instantly rendered hilarious. Lost your mind? Haaaaaa haaaaaa haaaaaa. Lost your children? Haaaaa haaaaa haaaaa. Here's hoping you get drunk and stumble into a threshing machine so we can print out the pictures and stick them on the office noticeboard and laugh till our noses run. And why? Because we're better than you.</p> <p>Asserting an unearned, wisp-thin air of superiority: that's what it's really about. </p> <p>The equation runs as follows: vacuous celebrities are trashy and annoying + I consider myself above them = HAAAA HAAAA HAAAA CHECK OUT THE SUFFERING LOL!!!!</p> <p>It doesn't add up. If you look down on the genuine misery of those you consider beneath you, you're not just being an arsehole, but a snooty one to boot. The very fact that you're willing to get so annoyed by an irritating celebrity that you'll gleefully jettison any notion of sympathy is surely a bright scarlet warning light indicating just how empty your spiritual gas tank has become. We're talking about Kerry Katona here, not J\u00f6rg Haider. Do you want to end up like Carole Malone? No? Then for Christ's sake take up a hobby or something. Fly a kite. Phone a friend. Visit a museum. Play some Guitar Hero. Anything. Just gain a little cheerful perspective.</p> <p>Because we're all just jerks in the playpen, when it comes right down to it. And tossing insults and brickbats is all part of the fun, especially when it's done with panache. But when anyone - no matter how annoying - stumbles and shatters their skull, you'd better be prepared to either shut up or help them. Why? Because you're also a grown up, stupid. And that's what they do.</p> <p>\u2022 This week Charlie decided that the minute he finished writing this sentence about what he'd done this week, he'd go and buy <strong>Dead Space</strong>, the outer-space survival horror game: \"Because I'm a nerd - and I'm not ashamed.\"</p>",
  "<p>At \u00a332.5m, with a weekly salary of \u00a3160,000, Robinho might have to pull up a few more trees before anyone at Manchester City can think of him as a bargain but if these things actually matter to the club's new owners there can be no argument that their showpiece signing has thus far been value for money.</p> <p>In eight appearances since swapping Madrid for Manchester and becoming the most expensive player in English football, Robinho has now accumulated six goals, his hat-trick of right-footed finishes here yesterday making it a chastening experience for a Stoke City side that might have to learn one or two new tricks to go with Rory Delap's torpedo-like throws.</p> <p>Delap's speciality has become such a key part of Stoke's artillery that their supporters have even adapted a strange little hands-in-the-air routine whenever he gets the chance to hurl the ball into the opposition penalty area. On this occasion, however, the tactic came up short as, after a bright opening, Tony Pulis's side were bamboozled by some lovely one-touch passing football, with Robinho too elusive and too clever for the visiting defenders.</p> <p>\"The crowd adore him, and rightly so,\" Mark Hughes, the home manager, later reflected. \"He was excellent - not just because of his goals but his football intelligence, his appreciation of where his team-mates were, where the opponents were and how best to hurt them. He had all that.\"</p> <p>He was entitled to eulogise because, for Stoke, the damage could conceivably have been worse if their opponents had been more clinical during a second half in which they should really have emulated the six-goal drubbing they dished out to Portsmouth last month. Once he has put the match ball away as a souvenir, Robinho will reflect on two glorious but spurned opportunities to consolidate his new status as City's leading scorer, while Shaun Wright-Phillips and Stephen Ireland both wasted one-on-ones against the visiting goalkeeper, Thomas Sorensen. </p> <p>Stoke, in fairness, looked threatening for pockets of the game and afterwards Pulis was restrained in his criticisms, pointing out they had 56% of possession. It was an unexpected statistic and, on reflection, Pulis will be dismayed about the time and space his defenders afforded not only Robinho but also City's more unlikely hero, the 19-year-old Daniel Sturridge.</p> <p>Despite all Robinho's repertoire, Sturridge laid on the game's most impressive moment, in the 47th minute, when he set off on a marauding run before splitting the visiting defence with a beautifully weighted through-ball. Having beaten Sorensen with a confident shot, Robinho was quick to kneel down and pretend to shine the boots of his young accomplice. When the two players combined again in the 72nd minute, Robinho's cool finishing produced a similar outcome. \"They showed a fantastic understanding of each other's game,\" said Hughes.</p> <p>Sturridge had come on three minutes before the break after another 19-year-old, Ched Evans, suffered a knee injury. Both look outstanding prospects - as does the young goalkeeper Joe Hart who yesterday signed a new five-year deal -and Evans can also reflect on an important contribution when, on 14 minutes, Elano knocked the ball down to him from a Wright-Phillips cross. The teenager was in a shooting position and might have been tempted to have a go at goal himself but had the presence of mind to angle a pass into the path of Robinho, coming in from the left, and the former Real Madrid player did the rest with a crisp finish. </p> <p>Two months into the latest, most unorthodox, period of his career, Robinho has his first English exam this week. If he is as clever off the pitch as he is on it, he can expect to pass with distinction.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Robinho</p> <p>The biggest compliment that can be paid to the Brazilian is that he has been as good as City's supporters had dared to hope</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> The confidence with which he put away his hat-trick goal</p>",
  "<p>Harry Redknapp agreed to become the new manager of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> only after receiving assurances from the chairman, Daniel Levy, that he would have control over the club's transfer policy. </p> <p>A series of previous White Hart Lane managers have had cause to complain about conflicts with the various sporting directors but Levy has now scrapped the position with the sacking of Damien Comolli, who departed with the manager Juande Ramos and his assistants Gus Poyet and Marcos Alvarez on Saturday night. </p> <p>\"The chairman will do the deals,\" said Redknapp, who was in the dug-out for the 2-0 home win over Bolton Wanderers yesterday, which halted the team's dismal run of eight Premier League matches without victory. \"I will pick the players, and if he [Levy] can deliver them then great. I would not let anyone else buy my players. There is no question of a director of football. I just deal with the chairman.\"</p> <p>One of the previous regime's major signings, Roman Pavlyuchenko, gave Redknapp the ideal start. In the first half, the Russian striker scored his first league goal for Tottenham, before Darren Bent added a penalty in the second. Spurs' cause was aided by the sending off of Bolton's Gavin McCann for two bookable offences.</p> <p>Redknapp said that Levy knows that the team \"needs strengthening in two or three positions\" and did not rule out a January raid on his old club <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a>. Tottenham have a long-standing interest in the midfielder Lassana Diarra, while the crowd repeatedly chanted the name of the striker Jermain Defoe, who left Tottenham for Fratton Park in January. \"The last word on players has to be with the manager,\" Redknapp added. \"At Portsmouth, Peter [Storrie, the chief executive] did all the deals but it was my choice on picking the player. If people are giving you players you do not fancy, it is impossible.\"</p> <p>Redknapp said he heard of Tottenham's interest in him on Friday - \"I thought it was a wind-up at first\" - but it did not take him long to decide to accept. He had almost been offered the job in February last year, when Martin Jol was enduring a difficult time, only for the Dutchman to embark upon an encouraging unbeaten run. After turning down the Newcastle United job at the beginning of the year, Redknapp, who has signed a three-year contract worth \u00a33m a year, believed that the timing was right for him. </p> <p>\"Tottenham is a big club, whether they are bottom of the league or not,\" he said. \"The crowd, the stadium, the whole set-up. I almost went to Newcastle. People said I didn't want to take on the big challenge. Maybe I didn't want to leave Portsmouth at that time. I was happy there and obviously we went on to win the FA Cup. I just feel that things are going to get a bit tighter there [financially]. I would have regretted it for the rest of my life if I hadn't accepted this offer. Peter [Storrie] said to me 'You want to have a good look at it.' We are big friends and he was right.\" </p> <p>Tottenham have paid Portsmouth \u00a35m compensation for Redknapp, who said he would take Kevin Bond, the former Bournemouth manager, on to his coaching staff. \"There is not a lot of staff left here,\" he added. \"There are some vacancies. There are one or two ex-Tottenham players who have great futures in the game. I would like to talk to them.\" He joked that his son Jamie, the former Spurs captain, was paid \"too much money by Sky TV\" as a pundit to be one of them. Tottenham also face severance payments of at least \u00a310m to Ramos, Comolli and the rest.</p> <p>\"For me, staying in the Premier League is my first priority,\" said Redknapp. \"The record was two points from eight games. We are in trouble. Anything else, like success in the cups, is a bonus. The priority is league points. At least this win gives us a bit of confidence going into the Arsenal game [on Wednesday night]. It has bought a smile back to the players' faces.\"</p> <p>Levy, against whom demonstrations had been planned for yesterday, had pledged to support Ramos, only to have a change of heart. He called the players from their rooms at the team hotel on Saturday night to tell them of his decision. The timing caught out the programme editors: Ramos's column appeared as usual, saying that \"if you believed everything that was being speculated on then your perception would be far removed from the reality. Everybody is united in our aim of addressing our poor league position.\"</p> <p>Tottenham played with greater freedom against Bolton and the captain Ledley King said that the performance \"was more like us\". \"The players,\" he added, \"seem to have a weight off their shoulders today for some reason.\"</p>",
  "<p>If a pollster wishes to test contrasting spontaneous reactions, he might start by reciting the words Mandelson, Osborne, Deripaska. Then, when the respondent has stopped shuddering, the inquisitor could murmur \"Alan Bennett\". Almost every literate person in the land will beam seraphically.</p> <p>That would have been true even before last week, when Britain's most beloved playwright, old buffer and all-round good egg revealed that he was donating his personal papers to Oxford's Bodleian Library. A formal announcement will be made today. This is not so much a good deed in a naughty world as the only bright gleam on a horizon otherwise promising doom. It makes all of us feel better, to see a good man do something wholly benign, in a universe where bunglers and four-letter types otherwise appear to be in untrammelled control.</p> <p>Even in the long-lost era when Britain's economy boomed, philanthropy did not. To be sure, some very rich people have given some large cheques to good causes. But we have failed to imbue the more prosperous part of our society with anything like the giving ethic that prevails across the Atlantic.</p> <p>To get on socially in any American city, for many years it has been essential to make substantial contributions to its arts, and to educational and social causes. It is not only the super-rich who do this. A host of middle-class Americans earning six- rather than seven-figure incomes expect to turn out regularly for $1,000-dollar-a-plate dinners on behalf of their local museum or ballet company.</p> <p>Once when I was involved in some fundraising, I spent a morning at New York's of Art quizzing its money people about how they generate the institution's huge income. One of them said: \"An awful lot of people in this town are willing to pay $50,000 to meet Brooke Astor [an American philanthropist and socialite].\" In Britain, to be sure, we have charity committees and dinners and royal bike rides across Africa. But the total sums raised are nugatory in comparison with those collected in the US, even in proportionate terms.</p> <p>Over there, giving is not only fashionable but almost mandatory. Here, if one becomes vastly wealthy, more social benefits accrue from buying a grouse moor or - even after recent headlines - a yacht, than from giving some millions to the National Gallery. Culture flourishes in Britain chiefly on the back of state funding. Only very few institutions, such as Glyndebourne's opera house, flourish exclusively thanks to private generosity. </p> <p>A small number of very rich people, headed by the Sainsburys and Lord Rothschild, give big money to cultural and heritage causes. Vivien Duffield raised relatively huge sums for the Royal Opera House, and is now doing the same for Oxford University. But the endowments of Oxford and Britain's handful of other world-class universities lag far behind those of their American counterparts. The prevailing social climate among the haves of British society remains philistine.</p> <p>The only hope of changing this lies in example. Tom Stoppard is at present devoting much of his energy to leading an appeal for the London Library, one of the finest private cultural institutions in the country. The tycoon and publisher Bob Gavron has done a lot for the British Library, and indeed for other civilised causes.</p> <p>Yet Bennett's gesture in promising his archive free to the Bodleian bucks the trend among British writers. Most, when offered large sums by rich American institutions, swiftly bank the cheques, in the manner of Salman Rushdie. If British universities want authors' papers, they must bid for them, just as British galleries have to raise huge sums to prevent the export of aristocratically owned Old Masters.</p> <p>I have heard a cynic observe that it is easier for Bennett to be generous, because he does not have the interests of children to think about. Few of us, however, would allow that thought to diminish our appreciation. Bennett's history suggests that he is simply a decent man who likes to behave well. He says that his donation to the Bodleian represents a gesture of gratitude for what the despised \"nanny state\" did by providing him with an education. This sounds no more or less than the truth.</p> <p>Compassion and melancholy have been as consistent strands in his work as wit. It is surely the absence of sincere, as distinct from synthetic, compassion that provokes Bennett's revulsion towards most newspapers. He himself can find pity for kings and queens; for old Hector the groping history master; even for the traitors Burgess and Blunt. </p> <p>Bennett commands public affection, even love, in a fashion that scarcely any other living writer can match. Brilliance and cuddliness seldom go together, but those of us who have never met him believe that he possesses both. He is also here. That is to say, he remains firmly rooted in the Yorkshire world in which he grew up, rather than decamping into tax exile abroad - as do so many writers and stars whom the state, incomprehensibly, rewards with knighthoods.</p> <p>It must sound perverse for a journalist to applaud the shyness that makes Bennett reluctant to give interviews. When it became known a few years ago that he had been suffering from colon cancer, he said that he did not reveal his condition publicly, because he \"did not want to die in the pages of a newspaper\". Almost all writers, not to mention actors, are properly judged by their published or performed work. They diminish themselves by exposing their private thoughts and lives in the media, even if such diminution is an inescapable part of the business of promoting their wares. </p> <p>Bennett breaks cover only when he is publicising some cause that rouses his enthusiasm, usually of an impeccably wet liberal nature. That is intended as a compliment. We need all the wet liberals we can get, not only in the world in which we live, but in the new one into which we appear to be plunging. Though Bennett is a hugely popular voice in modern Britain, he represents values and virtues that are instinctively traditional.</p> <p>Nobody today reads CP Snow's novels. Written between the 1930s and the 1950s, they reflected Snow's serene conviction that socialism not merely should prevail, but was certain to do so. Bennett would not have been out of place in Snow's prewar Cambridge - erudite, quirky, donnish, often perverse, fascinated by the tensions between private and public responsibilities.</p> <p>Uncharitable critics would suggest that Bennett is a peerlessly intelligent entertainer rather than an important writer, and perhaps that is so. It is debatable whether his plays will be performed half a century from now. But his own persona has given as much pleasure as his work. It makes us feel fractionally better about our own society, that somebody like him exists and flourishes in its midst.</p> <p>His gift to the Bodleian is a noble gesture, and there are not many of them around. If it inspires his peers, and indeed the rest of us, to behave just a little more generously in our own lives, then it will achieve much more than provide a treasure trove for literary scholars.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>"
