  "<p><strong>What was your favourite book as a child and why? </strong></p> <p>When I was a child, I studied at a French school, and I loved La Fontaine's Fables about animals. I thought it was fascinating and it had a very big influence on me. </p> <p><strong>When you were growing up, were there books in your home? </strong></p> <p>Yes. My father was a writer and a lawyer, and so he had many books. There was also a public library in the building where I lived, and as a kid I used to borrow books as well.</p> <p><strong>Was there someone who got you interested in writing? </strong></p> <p>My father again. I was his only child and so I was very close to him. When he was writing, I felt very excited about seeing him writing. He was still my father at this moment of writing, but he was also another person. He gave me books, and he discussed the books with me. He passed away when I was 19 it's been another huge influence on me.</p> <p><strong>What was the best advice given to you when you were starting out? </strong></p> <p>By the time I was 19, I had already written some articles and my father told me: \"You are talented, but you must work very hard and you must keep writing as your first priority. The day you discover that writing is no longer your first priority then you had better stop writing.\" </p> <p><strong>What made you want to write when you were starting out? </strong></p> <p>I don't think somebody can decide to be a writer. I think people are born writers and they are lucky if they discover this. I think I discovered this very early because from the age of 11, I didn't have any other dream. And I was lucky because I had a father who helped me along.</p> <p><strong>Do you find writing easy? </strong></p> <p>No, you see I am a writer and a dentist and I think writing is much more difficult than any other profession because you must be a hard worker and you must be devoted. \"Writing\" simply means that you are going to enclose yourself in your office for hours, days, and years to improve your writing, to get your style. You will never be able to do this unless you love writing more than anything else in life, and that was exactly the advice of my father.</p> <p><strong>Does it get easier over time? </strong></p> <p>No, it does not. It is as difficult as before; the problems just change. When you begin your career, you have a whole bunch of problems to face and then when you solve those, you discover new ones.</p> <p><strong>What drives you to write now? </strong></p> <p>You cannot stop writing. I believe the novelist is two persons at the same time. There is one person, who lives with other people and who does the things that other people do. And then, there is the novelist, who hides behind a very sensitive camera, noticing whatever they find exciting or interesting and keeping it for their writing. I am a novelist 24 hours a day. I always use the eyes of a novelist and I cannot imagine life without writing.</p> <p><strong>What preparation do you do before you start to write? </strong></p> <p>I write between 6.30am and 10.30am, every day of the week, except Friday. Friday is like Sunday in the west. If I don't wake up early, I feel really guilty, even if I am not working on a specific novel. Then, I work in the afternoons as a dentist for two to three days a week. Before 2002, I had to work like any other dentist, but now I spend more time travelling because I have been translated into 21 languages and so I have to go almost everywhere in the world.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give to new writers? </strong></p> <p>The most important thing is to be sure that you are talented. If you are sure you are, then you must ask yourself if you are willing to give up everything in life for writing. If the answer is yes, then you go and work hard and you will get what you want. But if you realise that you that you care about other things in life, then I think it is better not to waste time writing because you will never make it.</p> <p><strong>Is there a secret to writing? </strong></p> <p>Yes, of course. There are secrets in any profession and the more you practice and get experience, the more you will know of its secrets. </p> <p>But in creative writing there are many mysterious aspects. For example, how the characters can become independent of you. This happens to me all the time. Then, I don't have any more control over the characters. I see on the screen of my imagination, the characters doing what they decide to do, and I follow them. I cannot push them anymore, to do something that I want. </p> <p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong><br>I am working on a novel set in Cairo in the 1940s. It is going to deal with, the west and the Arab - cultural dialogue.</p> <p>\u00b7 Alaa Al Aswany's book, Chicago, is published in hardback by Fourth Estate.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338324706\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1840647471_gdn-nat-080929-lt-smoking-packaging-02-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Cards on the table: I'm an ex-smoker. A late starter, admittedly; I inhaled my first lungful in France at the age of about 14, but didn't succumb properly till about midway through university. I was into my stride by the mid-80s, loving the classic burgundy-and-gold elegance of the old Dunhill Reds. </p> <p>It was an international affair. In Amsterdam, where tar-stained ceilings in fug-filled cafes reminded you that smoking was Holland's national sport, everyone rolled their own. I fell for Van Nelle Zware Shag, the only tobacco, so the gale-lashed Dutch fisherman in the ads used to say, that you can still taste in a storm force 10. </p> <p>In Scandinavia, I switched to Petteroes No 3, a sweeter blend from H Petteroe Tobaksfabrik in Oslo. In Paris, I flirted for a while with the husky Gallic charms of Bastos Bleu Sans Filtre, before finally returning to my first love: un paquet de Dunhill Rouge, s'il vous plait. Obviously, I tried to stop. Often. Giving up is easy, I'd say: I've done it dozens of times. Eventually, I did. </p> <p>But the reason for recounting this is that it all happened quite a long time ago now, at a time and in places where smoking was in no way a reprehensible activity (my first encounter with France's interpretation of the no-smoking area, in about 1980, was a sign in the corner of a restaurant that read, roughly, \"We apologise to our valued customers, but the law regrettably obliges us to reserve these tables for non-smokers.\") </p> <p>Now, of course, things are different. These days, it's actually quite difficult to be a smoker. Even Paris - even, so help me, Amsterdam - has smokefree legislation. In Britain, there's no more tobacco advertising, cigarette packets inform you bluntly that smoking their contents will kill you, it's illegal to sell tobacco products to the under-18s, you can get help with quitting on the NHS, and, most striking of all, it has become illegal to smoke in pubs, clubs, restaurants, any enclosed public space. </p> <p>That's not the end of it. Over the coming year, smokers are going to have to get used to seeing an attractive selection of pictures on the back of their fag packets. One is of some poor sod, chest riven open, undergoing open heart surgery. Another is a frankly repulsive close-up of a throat sprouting some gruesome, fleshy growth. A third shows someone's foul and cancerous mouth, all missing and blackened teeth and dark, diseased tongue. </p> <p>There are 14 of these shockers, and every cigarette packet sold in this country will have to carry one of them by October 2009. We're in the vanguard here, the first EU country to make photo warnings compulsory on all tobacco packaging. (In Canada, where they were launched in 2001, 31% of ex-smokers say they helped them kick the habit.) In fact, we're pretty good across the whole anti-smoking front: since the government's 1998 white paper Smoking Kills, Britain has become recognised as the European leader in tobacco control.</p> <p>In this country, in 2008, smoking is basically seen as antisocial and, increasingly, socially unacceptable. When I took my first puff, in the mid-70s, you could light up pretty much anywhere you liked and no one would raise an eyebrow: bus, cinema, dinner table. These days, guests don't even bother asking their host if they might smoke. They withdraw, discreetly, and slip outside (where they're not safe from abuse either; these days, smokers routinely get told off for indulging in the open air). </p> <p>All of which should mean that smoking was a rather less widespread activity in Britain than it still is. Certainly the atmosphere is hostile enough to committed smokers for their tireless lobby group, Forest, to complain of \"persecution, bullying, humiliation and coercion\" in regard to a habit that never has been, and in the foreseeable future is unlikely ever to be, declared illegal. Despite all the anti-smoking measures of the past 10 years, says its director Simon Clark, smoking rates have fallen by only a few percentage points. \"We're all for education about the health risks of smoking, but this has now gone way beyond that,\" Clark says. \"I think it's a sign of desperation. The government seems determined to humiliate smokers until they behave in a state-approved way. Maybe the anti-smokers can knock one more percentage point off the smoking rate, but is it worth it for the bully society we're creating?\"</p> <p>For sure, many fewer of us light up than in 1948, when 82% of British men and 41% of British women were regular smokers. By 1974, 51% of men and 41% of women smoked; by 1992, it was 28% of us; in 2005, 24%. Since the Smokefree England legislation came into force in July last year, a further 235,000 people have given up with the help of NHS Stop Smoking Services. According to Professor Robert West's Smoking Toolkit Study, some 400,000 people have quit in the wake of the ban. </p> <p>But that still leaves 23% of men and 21% of women, or just over 9 million people still smoking. They must know, or at least be aware of, the risks they are running: half of all regular cigarette smokers will die from their habit. Each year, some 114,000 smokers in the UK die from smoking-related causes. Smoking remains the single biggest cause of preventable deaths in Britain, killing more each year than alcohol, obesity, road accidents and illegal drugs together.</p> <p>So the real question is: who still smokes? The answer, according to Beyond Smoking Kills, a report published today by the broadly endorsed pressure group Ash, is the poor. \"The health inequalities involved are perhaps the most striking thing about smoking in Britain today,\" says Deborah Arnott, its president. \"The more deprived your circumstances, the more likely you are to smoke.\"</p> <p>According to Professor Martin Jarvis, a psychologist at University College London and a leading specialist in the field of smoking and health inequality, this is not a question solely of income: every main indicator of a lower socio-economic status is likely, independent of each of the others, to predict a higher rate of smoking. If your educational level is below the average, you are more likely to smoke. If you live in rented or overcrowded accommodation, you are more likely to smoke. Ditto if you do not have access to a car, are unemployed, or on state income benefit.</p> <p>\"There's already a considerable social gradient simply in who starts smoking,\" says Jarvis. \"But the main, really steep gradient is in who manages to stop. People in depressed circumstances are basically far less likely to give up. This isn't to do with motivation - they actually want to quit just as much. They just don't seem to be able to. The more deprived you are, the more dependent you are on nicotine, the more nicotine you take in.\"</p> <p>Today, 17% of men and 14% of women in professional and managerial occupations smoke. In routine and manual occupations, the figures are, respectively, 31% and 28%. In the most deprived areas of England, in parts of Knowsley and Liverpool, up to 52% of people smoke. In the least deprived, in places such as Rushcliffe, south of Nottingham, and Heatherside and Eastleigh in Hampshire, as few as 12% do. Some 48% of men in the poorest social class die before reaching 70, compared to just 22% in the most affluent; smoking is generally estimated to account for at least half that terrible difference in life expectancy.</p> <p>Several theories are advanced as to why people in deprived circumstances are so much more likely to smoke. The habit, says Jarvis, might be considered a form of self-medication: nicotine (and it is pretty much accepted that nicotine is why people smoke) is \"doing something for you that you value. Many smokers think it helps them deal with stress, reduce anxiety. Of course, there's very little evidence that it actually does that.\" Mainly, it seems, all smoking a cigarette does is relieve the (temporary) withdrawal symptoms you get from not smoking a cigarette. </p> <p>There's also the economic argument. A smoking habit of 20 a day costs between \u00a31,700 and \u00a31,900 a year. Poorer smokers will spend a disproportionately large share of their income on cigarettes; research from 2003 showed that the poorest 10% of households in Britain spent 2.43% of their income on smoking, against 0.52% for the richest 10%. A 2004 Family Spending survey found that among the most deprived families of all - single parents on state benefits - three out of four smoke, a habit that costs them more than one-seventh of their total disposable income.</p> <p>\"One of the things that means, says Jarvis, \"is that if you're a poor smoker you're going to want to maximise the 'hit' you get from each cigarette, because it represents a larger chunk of your income. The amount of nicotine you can get from each cigarette is very elastic; it depends how hard you puff, how deeply you inhale, how much of the cigarette you smoke.\" Across all age groups, and even if they smoke the same number of cigarettes, poorer smokers take in markedly more nicotine that wealthier ones. \"Smokers in lower socio-economic groups,\" says Jarvis, \"are addicted to a higher hit. Their nicotine addiction is stronger.\"</p> <p>Finally, poor families, being more likely to smoke, are more likely to produce future smokers. In general, fewer and fewer children in Britain are smoking: from 13% of 11- to 15-year-olds in 1996, the figure has now fallen to around 6% (including 9% of 14-year-olds, and 15% of 15-year-olds). But according to a recent Dutch study, the children of smoking parents are four times more likely to smoke themselves. And emulation or experimentation at an early age is a clear predictor of later smoking; a 2004 US survey found that smoking just one cigarette in early childhood more than doubles your chances of becoming a smoker by the age of 17.</p> <p>The public smoking ban will, experts believe, have gone some way to reducing the gap in smoking rates between social classes: the most recent figures show the decline in smoking recorded since its introduction occurred across the board, regardless of class, age or gender. But the government's future tobacco control policies should, Ash's Arnott says, clearly include measures - including more free help in giving up - targeted specifically at deprived groups.</p> <p>\"Smoking's an amazing area,\" she says. \"Nobody really knows how best to ensure people eat less, and eat healthily; how to encourage them to drink less, or take more exercise. But with smoking we do know what works: since 1998 there's been a really very significant decline indeed. What we're doing is working; we just need more.\" Jarvis says that the present government's record in slashing smoking rates is \"probably one of its finest achievements\".</p> <p>So how to move forward? If the British public care deeply about questions of individual liberty, and will not in general support anything that unduly restricts it, most will back measures that might help cut tobacco consumption. Arnott cites the case of the public smoking ban, the idea of which was supported by just 20% of people in 2003, but this April by fully 78%. \"Big majorities also support raising tobacco prices by more than inflation, halting sales from vending machines, and ending point-of-sale displays,\" she says. </p> <p>\"But perhaps the best indication of how the public feel about the whole smoking issue is the fact that compliance with smokefree legislation in Britain is so spectacularly high - more than 98%. Compare that with the proportion of people who comply with the 30mph speed limit in built-up areas. That's only around half.\"</p> <p>Today's Ash report, 10 years after the important white paper Smoking Kills, estimates that smoking is costing the NHS in England some \u00a32.7bn a year. It calls for a comprehensive new national tobacco strategy and tough targets, including a smoking rate of 11% in the adult population as a whole by 2015. Among its key recommendations are a ban on all tobacco product branding (which means selling cigarettes in blank packs, except of course for a graphic health warning); prohibiting retailers from putting cigarettes on display (the huge displays in tobacconists and supermarkets are, campaigners say, a \"powerful promotional tool that encourages impulse buying\"; banning them would essentially mean stocking cigarettes under the counter) and outlawing tobacco in vending machines, which are used by about 20% of under-age smokers.</p> <p>The report also calls for a properly resourced fight against tobacco smuggling, which accounts for about 13% of the cigarettes and 20% of the hand-rolling tobacco smoked in Britain. It wants tobacco to be more expensive to buy than it is now (historically, cigarettes are 60% more affordable than they were in the 1960s). It would like to see deprived and marginalised groups given priority in all stop-smoking campaigns, and, for smokers who are really unwilling or unable to quit, it would like pure nicotine products such as gums and inhalers that deliver nicotine as effectively as cigarettes, but without the fatal by-products that come with smoking to be more widely available, more competitive, and even free on prescription.</p> <p>Will all this work? The problem, as the number of dedicated smokers in Britain continues gradually to dwindle, is that those that remain will prove more and more resistant; any measure perceived as aggressive could just as easily prove counterproductive. The evidence from a sample of smokers accosted on the streets near the Guardian the other day was, certainly, not entirely encouraging. Confronted with those unpleasant picture warnings, most did not feel they would persuade them to stop. </p> <p>\"They might stop a few young people starting, I suppose,\" volunteers Adam Riley, 41, sucking on a B&amp;H outside the sandwich shop. \"But I can't see them doing much for me. They're horrible, yes, course they are, but we already knew the risks, didn't we? What's this going to add to that, beyond making us all feel even more persecuted?\" </p> <p>Perched puffing on the steps outside their dance school, Jackie, Mandy and Felicity were similarly unimpressed. \"If you were already thinking about giving up, this might give you the extra incentive,\" concedes Felicity, 17. \"They are revolting, though, aren't they? Ugh. That throat one . . . I don't want to look at that too often. But I think if you've kind of rationalised smoking, then you'll just shut your eyes to these too.\" Mandy says she's only going to smoke for three or four more years, anyway. \"I'll be fine as long as I stop then. None of that stuff is going to happen to me, no way.\"</p> <p>David Levy, unemployed and 40, says he won't be quitting any time soon, whatever the government comes up with next. \"I'm a smoker. I have been for a very long time and I enjoy it. These won't stop people like me.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008. Britain will not become the first EU country to require photograph-based health warnings on cigarette packets next year as we said in the article above. That is already the case in Belgium and Romania. It will, however, become the first to make picture warnings compulsory on all tobacco packaging. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Five independent schools are facing inquiries in a test case of a law introduced to make fee-charging schools prove their public benefit in order to qualify for tax breaks. They include Manchester grammar school, which charges \u00a39,000 a year in fees, along with four other independent schools, as well as four religious charities and three care homes, which will also have to pass the public benefit test from next April. </p> <p>Private schools have been increasing their links with state schools and offering to share facilities with local comprehensives after the Charity Commission published guidance setting out the measures they can take to pass the test. </p> <p>Schools will have to prove that children who cannot afford their fees can still benefit from the education they provide through a range of measures, including giving more access to their facilities. </p> <p>The commission today publishes a report on the consultations it has received on the plans; it shows considerable opposition from private schools. The commission is accused of making too stringent demands on the schools.</p> <p>David Lyscom, the chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said: \"Faced with current cost pressures, we believe it all the more remarkable that most schools will also be able to demonstrate that they make exceptional contributions via free or discounted access and sharing arrangements, and community partnerships.\" </p> <p>The other schools are Manor House school trust, New Forest; Pangbourne college, Berkshire; St Anselm's school trust, Derbyshire; and Highfield Priory school, Lancashire.</p>",
  "<p>The Irish airline Aer Lingus was last night facing the threat of strike action after it announced swingeing job cuts and the outsourcing of all ground staff at Dublin airport as part of a \u20ac74m (\u00a357m) cost-saving programme. Up to 1,500 jobs will be lost by November 1, although the company said it would offer a voluntary severance or early retirement package, and those who do not take redundancy may transfer to a new service provider.</p> <p>The former state carrier wants to slash \u20ac50m from its payroll after last month announcing losses of \u20ac22m for the first half of the year. After a two-and-a-half hour meeting with unions in Dublin, its management said it would also eliminate \u20ac14m from its bill for advertising, distribution, airport costs and professional fees. A further \u20ac10m will be deducted from long-haul services, including flights to New York, Boston and San Francisco.</p> <p>Siptu, the largest trade union involved, said it would ballot its members this week on industrial action. Its national industrial secretary, Gerry McCormack, said: \"We are totally opposed to outsourcing.\" He said the plan \"represents a fire sale of good quality jobs by a management that can see no further than the next quarter's profit and loss sheet\". </p> <p>The Impact trade union said the proposals were draconian and severe. \"Impact will be consulting with its members employed at Aer Lingus before further steps are taken,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>The airline's chief executive, Dermot Mannion, said the plan was necessary to assure the company's future. \"The strategy today is to safeguard our long-haul services from Dublin and Shannon. In order to do that we are going to have to implement a very aggressive and radical cost-cutting plan,\" he said.</p> <p>The airline said all ground operations, including check-in, baggage handling, cargo and catering, would be axed at Dublin airport and outsourced. Shannon-based cabin crew and the mid-west airport's ground operations and cargo services will go, while ground operations in Cork will also be cut. Cabin crew bases in Heathrow will close, but the airline's new Belfast hub will not be affected.</p> <p>Tommy Broughan, the Irish Labour spokesman on transport, said the cuts went further than people's worst fears. \"Job losses on such a scale would mean that our national airline will be reduced to little more than a shell of its former self,\" he said. \"What was once an international brand of recognised quality is now becoming just another low-cost airline.\"</p> <p>Fergus O'Dowd, transport spokesman for Fine Gael, said: \"The survival of Aer Lingus is necessary to maintain a competitive airline industry in Ireland.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police and prosecutors are failing to tackle an epidemic of hate crime against disabled people, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales said last night. </p> <p>Sir Ken Macdonald, the director of public prosecutions, said that too many disabled people live in fear because the criminal justice system is letting them down. He told the Bar Council: \"Disability hate crime is widespread. At the lower end of the scale there is a vast amount not being picked up. The more serious offences are not always being prosecuted as they should be.\" </p> <p>Macdonald said examples of hate crimes included stones, yoghurt and bad eggs being thrown at the windows of disabled people. They were subjected to offensive remarks, including that they should have been \"put down at birth\".</p> <p>There had also been serious assaults in which disabled people were \"treated like animals [and] subjected to sustained, violent and viciously degrading treatment\".</p> <p>Macdonald said that police and prosecutors must stop thinking of disabled people as inherently weak and easy targets. \"This approach is wrong. It means that the opportunity to condemn the prejudice and hostility of the offender is missed.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Where there is evidence of hostility, police and prosecutors must ensure it is put before the court. It is our duty to give effect to the law which supports the struggle for disabled people to live as full and valued members of society. These offences represent a crude assault on their human rights.\"</p> <p>The law was strengthened five years ago to make the courts regard hostility to disabled people as an aggravating factor in any crime, requiring stiffer penalties. </p> <p>Macdonald said the police should look harder for evidence of prejudiced attitudes that could support a prosecution for disability hate crime.</p>",
  "<p>While Americans make their share of mistakes in raising children, abandoning them by the bucketload may not be one of them (US shocked by spate of abandoned children, October 4). The purpose behind \"safe haven laws\" was to encourage desperate young mothers who had hidden their pregnancies to leave newborns at designated places, such as hospital emergency rooms, rather than to expose them, or worse.</p> <p>Like Romulus and Remus, the idea was to prevent happenstance from determining the infant's fate and instead let social services arrange for an adoptive placement. Only Nebraska was silly enough not to set an upper age limit; most states require the baby be no more than six months; others set a limit of 72 hours after birth.</p> <p>From a public health perspective, safe haven laws have serious flaws. They encourage women to hide their pregnancies and deliver in secret rather than get prenatal and obstetric care. They also offer birth mothers much less protection than regular adoption statutes. But their aim is to avoid, not promote, infant abandonment in its harshest sense by offering isolated new mothers a chance to act responsibly.<br><strong>Carol Sanger</strong><br>Plumer visiting research fellow, St Anne's College, Oxford <br><strong>Barbara Aronstein Black</strong><br>Professor of law, Columbia Law School</p>",
  "<p>A food crisis is highly likely in the UK, with price and availability becoming issues that swing the outcome of future elections, according to a report from the thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>The UK's food system is unable to cope with rapid changes in supply driven by climate change, rising energy prices and population growth, the report says. Consumers are likely to have to accept a shift from individual preferences to a system in which government and industry have to ensure the food that is sold reflects the wider needs of society. The report, made available in draft to the Guardian, will be published next month. Hilary Benn, the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, used the first day of a Chatham House conference yesterday on the future of food to announce the creation of a food policy council to advise government on costs and security of supply.</p> <p>In what appeared to be a shift in policy, he said: \"With rising prices and increasing demand across the globe, we can't take our food supply for granted. </p> <p>\"Our supply needs to be reliable and resilient and able to withstand shocks and crises.\" </p> <p>In an indication of the government's concern about the effect of food price rises, Benn was asked to update Gordon Brown's national economic council on the UK's food supply yesterday. </p> <p>The Chatham House study concludes that the British government does not yet fully understand the challenges it faces over food in the 10 years. It identifies serious challenges to world agriculture:</p> <p>\u2022 UK consumers use food at a rate that represents six times more land and sea than is available to them. </p> <p>\u2022 Developed countries face a chronic shortage of migrant workers, leading to the loss of seasonal crops. In Scotland up to a fifth of the soft fruit crop, worth \u00a35.2m, could be lost in 2008. </p> <p>\u2022 The equivalent of 20 Nile rivers move annually from developing to developed countries, but much of agriculture's use of water is unsustainable. </p> <p>\u2022 Modern food production is energy-intensive and vulnerable to oil and gas price rises. </p> <p>\u2022 Rising prices of agricultural commodities have already produced pressure for more protectionism. Russia plans to form a state grain trading company to control up to half of its cereal exports. </p> <p>\u2022 Falling yields due to climate change will inflate food prices further. </p> <p>\u2022 The rapid rise in world population will continue to push up demand. </p> <p>\u2022 Emerging economies such as China and India are shifting to more meat and dairy products. This will cause greater pressure on food and feed prices, and exacerbate environmental and health problems. </p> <p>\"Other countries have already started looking at food in strategic terms. It's about time the UK did the same,\" said Kate Bailey, who led the research for the project.</p>",
  "<p>The Icelandic government last night presented an emergency bill giving it sweeping powers over the nation's banks, to save the country from financial ruin.</p> <p>In an address broadcast on Icelandic television, prime minister Geir Haarde said the bill, supported by opposition parties, would allow the government to push through mergers between the battered banks or force them into bankruptcy.</p> <p>The fate of Iceland, which has extensive interests in the UK, has been seen as a warning sign for the rest of the world, after a long boom fuelled by debt, a dependence on its banking industry and a buoyant housing market. </p> <p>Haarde, who had spent the weekend in intensive talks, made it clear how urgent the need for action now was. \"As recently as last night, it looked like the banks could continue operations for a while,\" he said. \"This morning and today, things have totally changed for the worse.\" Time appeared to be running out for Iceland to deliver a solution to the financial crisis yesterday as its currency, the krona, slumped 30% against the euro.</p> <p>The emergency bill, which parliament was due to adopt last night, would also allow the government to take over housing loans held by the banks. </p> <p>The financial regulator had earlier suspended shares in Iceland's main banks to prevent panic selling. The government also followed Ireland and Germany by guaranteeing all domestic deposits in Icelandic savings accounts, although UK savers in the popular Icesave and Kaupthing Edge accounts run by the Icelandic banks will not be covered. </p> <p>Concerns about the Icelandic economy grew stronger last week after the government seized control of the third largest bank Glitnir, taking a 75% stake in return for \u20ac600m (\u00a3466m) - Haarde warning Icelanders at the time of \"the inevitable cut in living standards\" to come.</p> <p>The falling currency, which closed at a record low of 230 Icelandic krona per euro, is worsening the crisis for the banks, which are shouldering large overseas debts, and for many thousands of individuals in Iceland who were encouraged to take out loans in foreign currencies. </p> <p>In Iceland, there was widespread fear. Sigridur D\u00f6gg Audunsdottir, a local government worker in Reykjavik said everyone in the country was \"holding their breath\". She yesterday withdrew her cash from the bank, all the way to her overdraft limit, to make sure her family had enough to live on. \"It is just unimaginable. It is so dark and gloomy, we have never experienced anything like this. I took out my money just to be safe, because I felt I had to do something. We've all been living ahead of ourselves, so in many ways this was inevitable. People here have been so obsessed with money. Iceland is like a nouveau riche country.\"</p> <p>A collapse in Iceland would severely dent confidence in the broader financial markets. But it also has the potential for direct impact in Britain, with the main banks funding a string of companies and high rolling entrepreneurs including Robert Tchenguiz, a large investor in Sainsbury's, chef Gordon Ramsay, the property tycoons Candy brothers and the chairman of West Ham Football Club, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson.</p> <p>One of Iceland's biggest companies, Baugur, has stakes in a swathe of the British high street, including House of Fraser, Karen Millen, Oasis and Whittard of Chelsea. One of the biggest credit insurance firms has stopped covering suppliers to Baugur controlled stores . In a statement over the weekend, it reiterated that most of the funding of its businesses comes from international banks and that it has little exposure to the disaster struck Icelandic economy.</p> <p>Haarde is said to have approached other Nordic governments to see if their central banks might be prepared to inject liquidity into the Icelandic system. Haarde said the banks had agreed at the weekend to sell some overseas assets and bring the cash back to Iceland. The nation's pension funds, which have assets of \u20ac12bn, are also being encouraged to repatriate cash.</p> <p>The two biggest banks, Kaupthing and Landsbanki, which runs Icesave, have thousands of UK savers' deposits, attracted by their competitive rates. The Kaupthing Edge account is covered by the UK government guarantee on deposits up to \u00a350,000, while in the case of Icesave, the first \u20ac22,000 (roughly \u00a317,000) is covered by the Icelandic compensation scheme and the remainder up to the \u00a350,000 limit by Britain. A spokeswoman for Kaupthing said there had been no rush to close accounts.</p> <p>Richard Portes, an expert on Iceland at the London Business School, said the government had made a mistake by nationalising Glitnir and creating fear in the markets, instead of just providing it with liquidity. \"You have the same law of unintended consequences that you had in the case of Lehman Brothers,\" he said. \"The Iceland problem was immediately vastly exaggerated.\" He said the Icelandic banks had been unfairly targeted. \"The world is a little unjust. They don't hold any toxic papers. The assets they will have to sell are perfectly good assets. They have been prudently managed and haven't been excessively dependent on the wholesale money markets compared to anyone else.\"</p> <p>Iceland has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past couple of decades, from an economy largely based on fishing to one of the richest in Europe, driven by its biggest banks after deregulation of the banking system. The banks grew rapidly on borrowing and now have assets eight times Iceland's GDP. But the party has come to an end, with the krona losing more than half its value against the euro in the past 12 months, inflation at 12%, and interest rates of 15.5%.</p>",

  "<p>Britain will issue a warning today that a lack of leadership in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">UN</a>'s handling of humanitarian emergencies is \"costing lives\", and will call for urgent reforms because natural and man-made disasters are increasingly frequent.</p> <p>In a speech to the UN in Geneva, Gareth Thomas, the international development minister, will say that conflicts, climate change and the scarcity of water and other natural resources, together with rising food prices, have combined to create an accelerating string of crises of unprecedented scale.</p> <p>\"The number of reported disasters over the past 10 years was 60% higher than the previous decade,\" Thomas will say, according to a text of the speech made available to the Guardian. The humanitarian response, he will argue, has not kept pace.</p> <p>Thomas will identify the principal problem as a lack of properly trained humanitarian coordinators to oversee disaster relief in crisis-hit countries. </p> <p>\"Of the 42 poor countries most at risk of conflict or natural disaster, one third do not have a humanitarian coordinator. So in some of the worst disasters there is no one on the ground to lead the international response,\" Thomas will say. \"That lack of leadership costs lives.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian yesterday, Thomas said that where there are coordinators, they are often not the right people. \"One of the major problems is that many country-based UN humanitarian coordinators don't have the skills or right background to do their jobs,\" he said. </p> <p>As an example, Thomas will point to Chad, where he argues \"poor coordination meant that drinking water was allocated unfairly and people in desperate need went thirsty\".</p> <p>\"This was counter to basic humanitarian principles and is something that cannot happen again,\" he said yesterday. British and UN officials agree that water distribution among refugees from Darfur and Chadian nationals made homeless by conflict in the region was haphazard and did not adhere to international standards, leaving many without adequate drinking water.</p> <p>The occasion for the minister's speech will be an executive committee meeting of the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), where there will be guarded support for his arguments in the hall.</p> <p>A senior UNHCR official said yesterday that \"in every single case\" the job of UN coordinator in crisis countries was given to the UN official already overseeing development work in that country, even though managing development aid and disaster relief require quite different skills and training.</p> <p>Thomas will argue today: \"Finding the best people for the job will require a more credible, transparent selection process; we need humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs [non-governmental organisations] to put forward candidates; we need more candidates from developing countries and more women.\"</p> <p>There is less support in the UNHCR leadership for another of Thomas's proposals - for humanitarian aid money to be pooled in affected countries and divided up among aid agencies on the ground.</p> <p>UNHCR officials say that sharing out money on a national level often leaves refugees at a disadvantage, as by definition they are not citizens of the countries where they have sought shelter.</p> <p>In a speech yesterday, the head of the UNHCR, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the committee approach to doling out emergency aid often led to too much red tape. \"We would like to see further simplification, fewer meetings and more of a focus on results,\" Guterres said. He added that he had made progress in reforming his agency's top-heavy management structure but admitted there was still a long way to go. </p> <p>\"In UNHCR I have been confronted with the most dysfunctional career management procedures that I have encountered in the whole of my professional and political life,\" Guterres said. \"And the price for this is unfortunately being paid by our staff and by the people we care for.\"</p> <p>He also called for greater resources to help deal with the rising number of refugees, but acknowledged that it was a difficult time to ask rich nations for money.</p>",
  "<p>We wish Peter Mandelson the speediest of recoveries from painful kidney stones. We need him tied to the hip with Gordon, providing wise and measured counsel. Like you, we have heard him deny \"dripping poison\" about the prime minster to George Osborne in Corfu - and that does seem most unlike him - but this also raises the question, what was he doing there in Corfu in the company of George Osborne anyway? Could it be that both he and the Tory shadow chancellor were at the party Jacob Rothschild threw for the guests who were staying at his estate on the island - the family Rupert Murdoch? It was Elisabeth Murdoch's 40th birthday we hear, and people travelled from far and wide hoping to touch the hem of Rupert's garment, not to mention that of his equally powerful son James. George and Mandy we are told were among them. Perhaps the excitement of the whole event made Mandelson indiscreet and, if that is so, we understand given the context. But overall the important thing is to be supportive. If his line is that he never said it, go with that for now. </p> <p>\u2022 For we would not want to make things any worse than they already are, given the polls - which continue to predict wipeout - and the fact that he as business secretary will control a budget less than half that handed to his predecessor. Large chunks of money that were allocated to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform related to the nuclear industry. It was well over half the budget and it has now been given to the new Department of Energy and Climate Change - proprietor Ed Miliband. Still Mandy will have the PM's ear. That's something. </p> <p>\u2022 For there is high excitement at the return of an icon; enough to have historians of British political history searching for parallels. When Winston Churchill returned to the Admiralty in September 1939, at the behest of Neville Chamberlain - who in truth couldn't bear him - all our ships signalled to each other. \"Winston is back,\" they said. So compare that with the excitement as Labour's advisers and spinners got the news last week. Winston's navy didn't have BlackBerries.</p> <p>\u2022 We're just glad to see Mandy back at the centre of things, just as much as the French are glad to be rid of him. \"Must we admit it? It's good news for European agriculture and farmers,\" the 320,000-member strong F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles, said yesterday. \"And so, a talented ideologist goes ...\"</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, as aggrieved black police officers tell of their tribulations within the service, and those in London turn to Boris Johnson for help - yes, it's that bad - members of the Labour party's original Black Sections movement met yesterday to recall the beginning 25 years ago of their battle for fair play and recognition. They packed into the Jubilee Room at the House of Commons to reminisce about the bashing they took from the media and from the hierarchy of the Labour party itself. And yet there was a degree of satisfaction, for star speakers included present-day beneficiaries of the agitation in the 1980s. David Lammy, Shahid Malik and Dawn Butler - all promoted in the latest reshuffle - were among the dignitaries. As was Diane Abbott, one of the first wave of minority members of parliament to make it to the House in the modern age. Two of the others, Paul Boateng - now our man in South Africa - and Keith Vaz, who is visiting India, sent messages of support. There were fond memories of Bernie Grant; and Sharon, his widow, heard of a renewed campaign to have his portrait hung in the House of Commons. This will have been a comfort - for two years ago, when last an enquiry was made, the House authorities said they had too many portraits already but they added that it might be possible to hang one of Bernie somewhere nice if Sharon were to commission and pay for it herself. With Labour in charge, for a while longer at least, campaigners hope the Commons will do better, especially as the 10th anniversary of his death falls in 2010. For crassness, they could hardly do worse?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When your PC starts acting as though it has attention deficit disorder, staring back at you blankly whenever you try to do anything, the natural instinct is to dial IT and demand a new computer. The last thing you want is for the voice at the other end of the phone to start talking you through complicated reboots, or suggest they come upstairs to \"have a look at it\". </p> <p>Although you may usually spend half your day on YouTube, suddenly you have important deadlines to meet. The best solution for all concerned is for the IT person to bring you a new machine. </p> <p>But where will the old one end up? According to Greenpeace and Computer Aid International \u2013 a charity providing refurbished computers to developing countries \u2013 your broken machine may be illegally shipped and dumped somewhere like Ghana, Nigeria or China. </p> <p>Last month Greenpeace released a <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/posoning-the-poor-electronic-waste-in-ghana-20080805\">report</a> detailing the increasing amounts of Britain's e-waste being found in huge toxic dumps in Ghana. There, impoverished workers burn it to extract precious metals, releasing harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. These deadly toxins are then inhaled by the workers, many of whom are children, while poisonous substances seep into the soil and rivers, from where they are ingested by livestock, whose meat is then eaten.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.weeecare.com/retailer-compliance.htm\">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment</a> (Weee) directive was put in place in 2007 to force retailers to take back old computers and recycle them properly. This should make things easy for your company \u2013 in theory it should simply return them to its IT supplier and its eco-conscience is clear. Except that this neat little system doesn't appear to be working.</p> <p>Greenpeace's report traces a calamitous chain of poisoning back to IT equipment from British businesses, colleges, councils and even hospitals. It says defunct computers are being shipped to developing countries by companies that claim they are functioning, second-hand goods for resale. </p> <p>The Environment Agency, which is charged with making sure the Weee directive is properly carried out, says it doesn't have the resources to check every container of second-hand IT equipment heading to countries like Ghana. </p> <p>Computer Aid this week called on the government to tighten up the directive and give the Environment Agency the power it needs to properly police this illegal trade. \"The Environment Agency must be provided with the resources to police e-waste, prosecute anyone involved in a supply chain that results in the dumping of e-waste and remove licences from organisations in breach of the Weee legislation,\" says Louise Richards, the charity's chief executive. </p> <p>\"It's imperative that the government clamps down on fraudulent traders posing as legitimate re-use and recycling organisations, who are enticing unwitting UK businesses to use them for disposal of electrical equipment.\"</p> <p>But for the time being, what can you do to make sure your old PC doesn't end up damaging a child in Africa?</p> <p>At a company level, your boss could try asking for guarantees from suppliers that returned goods will not end up on a dump somewhere in the developing world. Or, as in the days before Weee, the company could look for a reputable organisation to deal with its IT waste, such as Computer Aid International, which will only send working computers to developing countries, <a href=\"http://www.recom.org.uk/computers_for_charity/home.htm\">ReCOM</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.computersforcharity.org.uk/\">Computers for Charity</a>, both of which refurbish computers for community groups and charities. </p> <p>And what can you do as a worker? Try putting pressure on your boss to make sure the company is disposing of old equipment properly \u2013 and next time, get IT to fix your computer rather than demanding a replacement every time it takes more than four seconds to start up.</p>",
  "<p>Rural communities which protect nature and exploit forests, wetlands and wildlife sustainably will be the best equipped to cope with the droughts and floods that will increasingly hit Africa, Asia and Latin America with climate change, says a new UN-backed report.</p> <p>Nature-based enterprise, says the report from the World Resources Institute in Washington DC, offers the world's 2 billion rural poor key survival tools to weather the extreme changes that are expected. It argues that communities must be given secure rights to access, manage and profit from, the natural resources they depend on daily and calls on governments and development agencies to scale up such approaches.</p> <p>Supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank, the report, called Roots of resilience, urges immediate action. </p> <p>\"Poverty will never be made history unless we invest in more intelligent management of the world's nature-based assets,\" said Achim Steiner, UNEP under-secretary general and executive director, at the report's launch in Barcelona. \"Mainstreaming [such] models is now a matter of great urgency in a world challenged by climate change, in a world where we are pushing, if not pushing past, the regenerative limits of the planet's life support systems.\" </p> <p>To support its case, the report highlights successful, groundbreaking examples of nature-based livelihoods around the world. In famine-prone Niger, one of the world's five poorest nations, it reports, low-cost farmer-led efforts to regenerate tree stumps has led to a dramatic re-planting of the semi-desert Sahel region, increasing both rural incomes and food supplies.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, where 70 million people depend on floodplains for food and income, communities have achieved similarly spectacular results in reviving polluted and over-exploited wetlands. After the government awarded 110 villages joint control, along with local authorities, to manage sustainably the fisheries on the doorsteps, fish harvests rose by 140% and household incomes by a third.</p> <p>Scaling up such successful enterprise models, according to Roots of resilience, requires governments and donors to engage communities in sustainably managing drylands, wetlands, watersheds, and forests so that they provide a reliable, renewable source of food and income. In the process, the report argues, poor households will also develop the resilience needed to adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p> <p>The report's blueprint for making this happen includes: transferring legal authority over local ecosystems to communities; building community capacity both to manage natural resources and establish successful nature-based enterprises; and helping local nature-based enterprises link into mainstream business markets.</p> <p>\"Local communities clearly have an interest to sustain the ecosystems on which they depend,\" said Manish Bapna, executive vice president of the World Resources Institute, in Barcelona. \"But today, all too often, they face a disabling, not an enabling environment.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Well,\" said Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, yesterday after chairing the Metropolitan police authority's first meeting since he in effect sacked Sir Ian Blair last week. \"I think we have had a pretty good morning.\" And he beamed genially across City Hall's council chamber at the stunned members of the MPA.</p> <p>A pretty good two hours that is, except for the fact that the mayor had been castigated first for the way he dismissed Blair, then for not consulting members about the dismissal, then for announcing unilaterally that he was setting up an inquiry into race and faith issues within the Met, then for the proposed manner of that review, then for not consulting about that, then for announcing he was voting for a motion that had not been put, then for declaring the meeting prematurely closed before it completed its agenda, and finally for deciding off his own bat who would chair the MPA's committees. </p> <p>\"Much food for thought there,\" as he himself said at one point.</p> <p>If there seems to be something of a non-consultative pattern here, there was also a pattern of consecutive repentance. \"Sorry, sorry, sorry,\" he said time and again. When confronted with a critical motion, accusing him of usurping his powers over Blair's dismissal, he said disarmingly: \"Thank you very much. I don't disagree with your motion at all. I think it's eminently sensible ... thank you very, very much everybody.\"</p> <p>Welcome to the court of Mayor Boris. If the meeting occasionally resembled a politer version of Have I Got News For You, with Johnson as a one-man odd man out round, it was not for want of the mayor's trying. He tried very hard to butter the police and the authority up. </p> <p>He was very privileged, he said, to be there - having taken charge of the MPA only last week - responsible for the only police force in the world where tourists queued up to buy souvenir plastic police helmets. It was a force that did not operate by arbitrary authority - he said this with no perceptible hint of irony - and which was celebrated for its helpfulness, fairness and upholding of the law. He was certainly not going to micro-manage it. He was always willing to learn: \"I do want to work hand in glove with you,\" he declared. Pressed about the way Blair's dismissal was handled, he said: \"The chances of anything like this happening again are extremely, vanishingly remote and the vast majority of people will agree with that.\" </p> <p>Asked how widely he had consulted about the move, the mayor insisted that the consultations had been widespread. A quick round of hands showed a majority of members had not been consulted. \"This is becoming undignified,\" said Johnson. After two hours it was over. </p> <p>As he hastily closed the meeting, the mayor said with relief: \"Thank you very much. See you next month.\"</p>",

In a concerted advertising and internet blitz, Obama used the scandal in which McCain was reprimanded to link the Republican candidate for the White House to lobbyists and big business.</p> <p>The blitz was in retaliation for McCain linking the Democrat nominee at the weekend with Bill Ayers, a former member of a US urban guerrilla group.</p> <p>McCain's vice-presidential running-mate Sarah Palin, at a rally in Florida yesterday, again brought up the link between Obama and Ayers, and forecast that the campaign between now and election day was \"gonna get kind of rough\". </p> <p>The exchanges have created a poisonous atmosphere ahead of the debate in Nashville, Tennessee, one of the last chances for the Republicans to turn around a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselections2008\">White House election</a> that appears to be slipping away from them.</p> <p>The town-hall style debate is more important for McCain than Obama. A draw would be good enough for the Democratic candidate, but McCain needs to secure a clear-cut victory that might reverse the huge opinion poll losses of the past fortnight. If Obama maintains the poll lead through to the election on November 4, the Democrats would enjoy one of their biggest landslides in history.</p> <p>Tad Devine, the Democratic strategist who was a key adviser to both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/algore\">Al Gore</a> in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, said: \"He is going to have to go after Obama. If he doesn't go after Obama in the town hall meeting, his election is over. It's like sands through the hour glass.\" </p> <p>Although McCain apparently told his campaign team that Obama's ties with his former pastor, the controversial Jeremiah Wright, were off-limits, the conservative columnist William Kristol wrote in the New York Times yesterday that Palin said: \"I don't know why that association isn't discussed more, because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country.\" </p> <p>Howard Wolfson, Hillary Clinton's former communications manager, wrote in a blog for New Republic that McCain's negative campaign would not save the Republican candidate. \"John McCain's candidacy is as much a casualty of Wall Street as Lehman or Merrill,\" he said.</p> <p>Although there is a sense of despondency in the McCain camp, they are clinging to the fact that Obama's lead in the opinion polls is not, given the economic background, double the 7% lead that Gallup recorded yesterday. The poll put Obama on 50% to McCain's 43%.</p> <p>McCain, who was relatively passive in the first televised debate with Obama, spent the weekend at his home in Sedona, Arizona, practising for tonight's event which will be in his preferred format, with questions coming from the audience. Obama spent yesterday holed up in Asheville, North Carolina, rehearsing his lines, with a Washington lawyer, Greg Craig, playing the part of McCain.</p> <p>Obama broke off preparations yesterday for a television interview in which he spoke about his new ad describing McCain as one of the senators who lobbied in 1989 on behalf of Charles Keating, whose savings and loans institution collapsed. </p> <p>Obama claimed this showed McCain relied on lobbyists from the big oil companies and other corporations. \"I think it's going to be a lot more relevant to the American people than somebody who is tangentially related to me,\" Obama said, referring to Ayers. </p> <p>McCain's team said yesterday he would seek to raise concerns about the impact on voters of Obama's tax increases, and also Obama's criticism of US air raids on Afghan civilians.</p> <p>The McCain team faces potentially bad publicity after seven Alaska state employees who earlier failed to give evidence to a legislative inquiry agreed to testify on Palin's involvement in the Troopergate affair, the alleged abuse of her position as the state's governor to sack her former brother-in-law, who was involved in a child custody battle.</p>",
  "<p>The recent Million Women breast cancer study, which found that having children and breastfeeding protected against the disease, confirmed the findings of the 17th-century Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini, who came to the same conclusion after discovering nuns were more likely to develop breast cancer than the general female population.</p> <p>Nun-testing may sound old-fashioned, but in fact it's still rather common. The Nun Study, an ongoing investigation into Alzheimer's disease, involves 678 School Sisters of Notre Dame, originally ranging in age from 75 to 102, all of whom agreed to leave their brains to science. Spain's Centre for Information on Beer and Health fed beer to 50 nuns, half a litre a day for 45 days, in order to establish a link between beer consumption and lower cholesterol rates. Between 1967 and 2000, 200 nuns participated in a study about the benefits of calcium in preventing osteoporosis, which required, among other things, a hospital stay of eight days every five years. Two years ago 15 cloistered Carmelite nuns underwent scans in order to determine if there was a spiritual centre or \"God spot\" in the brain (there isn't, apparently).</p> <p>Why pester the nuns? One obvious reason is that the strictures of convent lifestyle make for an ideal control group. \"Many factors that confound (or confuse) the findings of other studies are either eliminated or minimised because of the relatively homogeneous adult lifestyles and environments of these women,\" reads the website of the Alzheimer's study. \"Participants in this study are non-smokers, drink little if any alcohol, have the same marital status and reproductive history, have lived in similar housing, held similar jobs and had similar access to preventive and medical care.\"</p> <p>They're also altruistic, which means they're willing to participate without complaining or expecting payment, simply in order to advance medical science. Their record-keeping tends to be scrupulous and their archives often go way back. And because they have no families, it is usually less problematic to take their organs for analysis when they die. If you've ever asked yourself, \"What have the nuns done for me lately?\", now you know. They proved beer is good for you.</p>",
  "<p>There is no doubt that in any further education league table Telford College of Arts and Technology would occupy a top position. It has, as its principal Doug Boynton proudly points out, won more \"beacon awards\" (17) than any other college and it is hugely successful in \"engaging\" employers. Indeed, 60% of its turnover comes from training people in their workplaces.</p> <p>But in one area, Boynton admits, his college has been a novice, so to speak. It has never ventured far into international business.</p> <p>So when Telford was asked recently if it would teach 48 young men from the Royal Saudi air force in a deal worth \u00a31.14m, as part of the Project Salaam, a UK-Saudi defence cooperation deal under which the desert kingdom is buying the new Eurofighter Typhoon, there was understandable excitement, tinged with apprehension. \"This is the first time we've managed a programme like this,\" says Boynton. \"We're babes in the wood at international work compared with some colleges.\"</p> <p>The students, average age 24, were to be trained at nearby RAF Cosford on servicing and maintaining Tornado and Typhoon aircraft. The college was being asked to bring students' written and spoken English, maths and physics up to scratch to do this training.</p> <p>Part of the apprehension concerned the wide cultural gap between the college and the would-be students. A consultant involved in the contract had warned Telford that only male teachers would be acceptable, Boynton said. </p> <p>\"In Saudi, people are taught in single-sex classes after puberty,\" he said. \"These men were coming from a culture where you do not talk to the opposite sex.\" But recruiting only men to teach the courses - the college had to employ extra staff for the programme - risked contravening UK equality legislation and the college's own codes.</p> <p>The college's governors agreed a compromise. For a short initial period, only men would teach the Saudis, but then women teachers would be deployed as well. But, in the event, says David Gill, director of international studies, not enough male teachers could be recruited and from the start the teaching staff was mixed. A senior Saudi air force officer confirmed that they were relaxed about women teaching the young men, anyway, he says.</p> <p>Nonetheless, some anxiety remained about differences in educational style. \"Everything is teacher-led in the system they are used to,\" says Boynton. \"They are empty vessels. The teacher has to fill them. Student-centred learning, which is the way that all colleges operate, is at the other end of the spectrum.\"</p> <p>But this anxiety, too, proved groundless. Faced with the task of learning English well enough to cope with complex engineering terminology, the young men responded magnificently, says Cathy Pritchard, one of their language lecturers. \"They were lovely people to teach,\" she says. \"I found them very respectful. As soon as I walked into the class I saw lots of smiling faces.\"</p> <p>On balance, the female teachers achieved better results than their male colleagues, says Boynton.</p> <p>The Saudi air force appears delighted with all results. During the course of the year it bumped up the number of trainees to 200, and the contract to \u00a33m.</p>",
  "<p>When Helen fell pregnant at 15, her life was turned upside down. While her friends were out clubbing, she was stuck at home with a baby. She began to feel isolated and depressed. So it was a great relief when her health visitor invited her to join a support group for teenage mothers, especially when she was assigned one-to-one support from a mentor. As well as providing a listening ear, 20-year-old Tamsin, a youth worker and herself a young mother, would be able to advise her on education and training opportunities. </p> <p>They met weekly at first, on neutral ground and Helen was grateful for the support. Alarm bells started ringing when she was invited to her mentor's flat one evening. As she smoked cannabis, Tamsin told Helen about the abuse she had suffered as a child. \"From that point on, it was as if we switched roles,\" recalls Helen. \"I knew something wasn't quite right about it, but I was young and vulnerable. I felt sorry for her and wanted to help.\" </p> <p>Despite her unease, when Tamsin became homeless, Helen let her move into her flat. \"She'd bring guys back, have parties and wreck the place,\" she recalls. \"Then she'd disappear for days on end, leaving me with her son. I started off as a struggling young mother of one and suddenly I had two children to look after. I asked her to leave. We don't speak any more.\" </p> <p> The experience has left her cynical about mentoring. \"It's scary to think of people like that being allowed to work with vulnerable young people. Someone must have known she was unstable. If I didn't have family support, she could have really messed up my life.\"</p> <p>A report published by the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies echoes her concerns. In Youth Mentoring: A Good Thing?, author Richard Meier argues that youth mentoring schemes could be doing more harm than good. \"While good mentoring can work for some young people, there is little evidence to suggest it works for all, particularly the most disadvantaged.\" There are 3,500 mentoring programmes currently running in the UK. Last month the government announced a \u00a33.8m cash injection to help fund schemes in knife-crime hotspots. </p> <p>Young people with emotional or behavioural difficulties are often targeted for mentoring. Individual programmes vary, but typically involve a weekly one-to-one meeting. While some mentors may simply provide a non-judgmental listening ear, others might offer practical help with job-hunting or getting into education. </p> <p><strong>Negligible benefits</strong></p> <p>But research into the benefits of mentoring has proved inconclusive. A 2002 study carried out by American researchers revealed only \"small or modest\" benefits. A 2004 study commissioned by the Youth Justice Board on its 80 mentoring schemes raised doubts as to whether mentoring makes a significant or lasting difference to young people at all. The problem is, says Meier, mentoring schemes are largely staffed by volunteers, who may be ill-equipped to work with vulnerable young people. </p> <p>There is no specific qualification or experience needed to become a youth mentor. While volunteers working with children are often required to have a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check, most are accepted following a short interview. While the Mentoring and Befriending Foundation (MBF), the national strategic body that supervises mentoring schemes across the UK, encourages and supports good practice, there are no statutory requirements for training and supervision, which means quality can vary. </p> <p>A poorly managed mentoring scheme has left 15-year-old Ben feeling cynical. He wasn't happy when teachers informed him he was being given a mentor, because of his \"anger problems\". \"I'd had a couple of fights, what teenager doesn't? I was one of 20 in my year to be chosen, out of 200 kids. I knew there were much worse kids than me. It made me feel like a bad kid.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, he warmed to his mentor, and appreciated having someone to listen. However, things turned sour when he learned she had shared personal information with a colleague. \"The first thing she told me was that it would all remain confidential. After three sessions, I confided in her that things weren't good at home. In the fourth session, she brought a colleague and started going on about getting me into foster care.\" The mentoring relationship broke down. \"I was given a mentor because of my so-called anger and it ended up making me feel angrier.\" </p> <p>The CPS report is particularly critical of the MBF, saying there is a lack of rigour and regulation in its work. But its deputy chief executive, Steve Leach, believes this is down to misunderstanding of the role of mentoring. \"We've never said mentoring on its own is the shining light which will solve all social ills. What we've said is that it can work alongside other services, as part of a package. Obviously there are always going to be one or two examples of mentoring where it doesn't work out, but the report is not representative of the good work happening around the country.\" </p> <p>Meier remains unconvinced. \"What is the rationale for believing that placing an adult with minimal training with a vulnerable young person will be helpful? Government and individual mentoring organisations have to stop claiming that mentoring is some kind of panacea for disaffected youth. It should be recognised as a highly skilled, specific form of intervention for troubled youth and needs to be much more carefully monitored than it is now.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>The best way to avoid plagiarism is to avoid reading anything written by somebody else. Unfortunately, this is not really what higher education is supposed to be about. While university teachers prize originality, they are not so keen on students relying entirely on imagination. By original thought, they tend to mean thinking something new about the thoughts of lots of other people, rather than just making it up.</p> <p>So you need to remember two things: first, that not all the brilliant insights you use in your assignment will be your own; and second, the names of all those other people involved so you can give them a mention.</p> <p>This comes down to efficient note-taking. Always write down the source of anything you consult, including that clever third-year who wrote a similar essay last year. Be methodical and accurate. Note the title of a book or website reference, author, date and page number so that you, and anybody else, will be able to check later where a particular idea came from. You also need to ask about the referencing rules of your institution and/or tutor and make sure you keep to them.</p> <p>When making notes, distinguish between your own profound thoughts on the text and the text itself. The text is usually the one that's a lot longer. This is your chance to devise a colour-coded system of notes to differentiate your thoughts, those of an author, and those of your tutor. Don't make it so complicated that you keep forgetting which is which colour. </p> <p>It is also the time to use plenty of quotation marks so you know what are direct lifts and what you have put in your own words. Don't forget that even if you paraphrase someone else's ideas you still need to mention whose they are. And even if you acknowledge the source properly, an essay still counts as someone else's work if you find you need quotation marks around the whole thing - or even around most of it.</p> <p>When paraphrasing an argument, it is a good idea to close the book you are consulting to make sure you are not copying it by mistake. (This technique is less useful if you sneak a few peaks or have a really good memory.)</p> <p>If you cut and paste from a website, you are definitely copying, even if you remember to reformat it so it looks like the rest of your essay, and change the spelling from American to English. If you don't even remember to take these steps you deserve all you get.</p> <p>And you could be caught, warns Jude Carroll, who has written a handbook on deterring plagiarism in higher education. She says that any \"smoking guns\", such as different fonts, spacing and margins, or anachronisms left in an essay, will force teachers to report you because their self-esteem won't allow anything else.</p> <p>In any case, most teachers now use plagiarism detection software that may well catch you out.</p> <p>You don't need to worry about giving a reference if you refer to a fact that is commonly known. But a commonly known fact is not the same thing as something that is commonly available on the internet, or that everyone else in your class knows because they heard it from that clever third year.</p> <p>Even if you don't feel guilty, always read through an assignment to check that you haven't plagiarised accidentally. Make sure you have cited a source every time you use it, and look closely at any paragraphs without references to see if they really are all your own work or should be attributed to that helpful internet essay bank.</p>",
  "<p>Is the UK banking system about to be part-nationalised or not? The banks themselves were braced for intervention yesterday. Many fund managers in the City, the big owners of those banks, supported the idea. The morning newspapers had prepared the ground. Then Alistair Darling spoke. He cued us up with his usual tease about doing \"whatever it takes\". Then he announced nothing. The result was confusion, the most dangerous fuel in today's markets.</p> <p>The other result is a search for a culprit. Choose your own villain. Did the banks, some of whom would prefer soft loans from the Bank of England to partial ownership by the taxpayer, protest? Did David Cameron, shouting about cross-party support for \"drastic capital measures,\" jump the gun? Did Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, encourage the thought that part-nationalisation was on the cards? Was it a cack-handed piece of news management by the Treasury? Or perhaps the newspapers got carried away.</p> <p>That sub-plot will run and run, but the moral the markets will take is that, once again, politicians seem to be struggling to keep up with events.</p> <p>Part-nationalisation, in itself, is a popular idea. To many minds, it is cleverer than the US model of buying toxic assets from the banks to create a \"Bad Bank\". Recapitalisation, with the state taking preference shares in the big high street lenders, would strengthen the institutions' balance sheets and, in theory, allow them to work through their problems in an orderly way. </p> <p>But, as in Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition sketch, the chief weapon is surprise: if you're serious about transforming the structure of the banking industry, you don't allow the idea to hang in the air for long.</p> <p>Why? Well, once the market senses news, it will trade on it. So yesterday all the banks which had been identified as candidates for part-nationalisation - Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Lloyds TSB/HBOS - saw their share prices tumble, by a startling 20% in RBS's case. Investors were making the reasonable assumption that returns for current shareholders would be diluted. Yes, the banks would be stronger as a result of explicit state support, but they would pay for the privilege. </p> <p>Now we have an unhappy mess, an expectation the government will intervene, but no firm commitment. What will the market make of that? On past form, it will try to force the politicians' hands. That may mean more volatility in the share prices of banks and more uncertainty. </p> <p>By the time the government gets around to intervening - if it does - a lot of political capital will be lost.</p> <p>It is hard not to feel some sympathy for the Treasury. Part-nationalisation is a big idea. The sums being whispered are enormous - \u00a315bn apiece for RBS and Barclays, it is said, and \u00a312bn for Lloyds TSB/HBOS, plus some form of handout to Nationwide, the big building society. It is not a plan you would announce before the impact on public finances is properly assessed. </p> <p>If we are talking about \u00a350bn or so, the protections for the taxpayer must be sold: the aim would be not only to kickstart lending to consumers and businesses, but to make a profit over time.</p> <p>Indeed, the most crucial question is the rate the taxpayer would charge the banks. Would the new preference shares carry a semi-guaranteed annual dividend of 10%? That is the rate Warren Buffett is charging Goldman Sachs in a deal that is supposed to have caught the Treasury's eye. But 10% might be too much for the banks to bear. Maybe a small premium over the yield on long-term government gilts - say 6% - might be more appropriate.</p> <p>Time to consider such technical questions would be preferable. That is now a luxury the Treasury hasn't got. Markets are craving certainty. The question of whether or not to bail out the banks needs to be answered soon.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Labour MPs rallied behind Gordon Brown last night amid signs that his government reshuffle and the financial crisis have taken the sting out of the challenge to his leadership that emerged last month.</p> <p>George Howarth, one of the MPs agitating for a leadership challenge, last night called off the fight, telling the prime minister and a packed meeting of Labour MPs that the \"hostilities are over\".</p> <p>Howarth said Brown's speech to the parliamentary Labour party was the best speech to a party meeting he had ever heard. </p> <p>\"Things have moved on and it's appropriate that the party unifies in the face of the present financial situation,\" Howarth said. </p> <p>\"I'm now confident the prime minister has a greater grasp of the problems around him than he did in August. Now the economic situation is on a knife edge and it is completely the wrong time for us to focus on internal party dissent.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was reported to have been given loud applause for what Labour MPs regard to have been a successful party conference speech and subsequent cabinet reshuffle. </p> <p>He told the room the party could still win the next election despite trailing in the polls, with a government aide saying Brown had told the meeting that \"people's minds are not yet set\". The aide said: \"We're back in the game.\"<br>Some in the room said Howarth's speech could even be interpreted as an \"apology\".</p> <p>Brown also announced that the Glenrothes byelection would be held on November 6. Critics have said that the Labour party is bracing itself to lose the seat and scheduling the byelection in the days immediately following the American elections could obscure a defeat.</p> <p>One of Brown's more controversial reshuffle appointments, Peter Mandelson, spent the afternoon of his first day back in Westminster in hospital undergoing an emergency operation to have a kidney stone removed.</p> <p>Mandelson experienced kidney pains over the weekend and was admitted to hospital yesterday afternoon. He was able to attend the first session of Gordon Brown's newly formed National Economic Council in the morning before admission to hospital and his office said he was back in meetings by teatime yesterday.</p> <p>It also emerged that the deputy leader of the Labour party, Harriet Harman, had condemned in private to friends Brown's decision to sack Parmjit Dhanda in the weekend reshuffle. Dhanda is the government's only elected minister from the Indian community.</p> <p>Harman texted friends to say that the decision was bad for the government and the party. She is said to be demanding his dismissal be reversed at a later date.</p> <p>The new parliamentary session presents immediately challenges to Brown, not least over the controversial legislation to increase the time limit for detention without charge to 42 days. There were reports yesterday that the government was even preparing to drop the bill, which faces defeat when it returns to the House of Lords this week. </p> <p>The government was thought to be gearing up to use the Parliament Act to force the legislation through and yesterday the government denied reports it was considering dropping attempts to push the legislation through, saying the position had not changed. </p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"Pushing ahead with the 42 days legislation is the right thing to do, given that the House of Commons has expressed its will.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, the Tories announced only a limited reshuffle, appointing rising star Greg Clark to their front bench to shadow Ed Miliband at the newly created Department for Climate Change and the Environment.</p>",

  "<p>It is no surprise that Crystal Palace's upturn in fortunes has coincided with Ben Watson's return to the side in the last month. He and Shaun Derry have formed a formidable midfield partnership in the central area with one playing not alongside, but in advance of the other. This enables one to be in touch with the strikers when the ball is played forward and the other to make tackles from the \"wrong\" side when their opponents have the ball.</p> <p>It is mainly Watson who is given licence to break forward and it was from one such occasion in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich the week before last that he missed a gilt-edged chance to win the game. After he had won the ball in midfield he carried on his run into the box as the ball was worked wide. Unmarked, he received the ball at the near post, in his stride, and decided to hit it first time. In doing so, he snatched at his shot and the ball went wide.</p> <p>For all Watson's enthusiasm to get about the pitch, he is not a player who wastes too much energy making runs when he has little chance of being involved in the play, preferring to wait and see how the move develops. However, that is not to say that he is anything other than eager to close the opposition down when they have possession - this is an attribute all winning sides need from their players but one that sometimes goes unnoticed by fans.</p> <p>I liked the way he kept it simple when he wasn't aware what was around him - once or twice he just hooked the ball on. It does not look great on the eye, but it was done with quality, always giving a team-mate the opportunity to either chase or fight for possession.</p> <p>His positioning was good from second-phase ball in the midfield areas as he headed and picked up a lot of loose ball, meaning he read the game well. Another part of his repertoire that emphasised this point was the number of times he intercepted passes to break up the opposition's moves. When he does sit deep for Derry it would help if he tackled more from the wrong side - at one point against Ipswich he allowed a situation to develop when he was left to mark two players on his own from a corner. He should have sorted it out earlier. Having said that, when he did identify danger he was terrier-like in staying with his man and seeing it through.</p> <p>It would be nice to see him be more demanding, either verbally or in his movement when his centre-forwards have their back to goal and he is facing them and wants to receive a pass. But for the most part he provided an option when at all possible.</p> <p>He was an England Under-21 international and he is in the last year of his contract. At this stage he has decided not to sign a new one, which is his prerogative. For that reason he was left out of the side, but luckily for him the team played poorly and he is back in. What the future holds only he knows, as it is always risky to let a contractual situation like this develop. The one thing you hope is that whatever time he has left at Palace, it won't be wasted on anything other than playing football.</p> <p><strong>Age </strong>23</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Lambeth</p> <p><strong>Position </strong>Midfielder</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>5ft 10in </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 10st 11lb</p> <p><strong>From </strong>Trainee</p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>8/10 </p> <p><strong>Tackling </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Passing </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 9/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a31.5m</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Glancey doesn't want ecotowns to be built (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/02/greenbuilding.planning\">Green and unpleasant</a>, October 2). Fair enough. The campaign against them is vocal, and the government has its work cut out trying to justify them. \"Pity the residents,\" says Glancey. \"Not only will they have to live in developer-built dormitory suburbs given a fashionable name, they will also be the subject of unprecedented scrutiny by quango folk.\"</p> <p>But if ecotowns have a point, it must surely be to explore how we can live sustainably. Unless you monitor performance, I wonder exactly how you would gauge their success. You can call that \"nosy-parker scrutiny\"; or take a less romantic view of real life and recognise that nobody will replicate a success that you cannot prove.</p> <p>Glancey recoils at the thought of thermographic cameras checking heat loss from homes, and bizarrely suggests that \"ecotownies partial to lamb cutlets and to cream on their strawberries might yet be watched as closely as al-Qaida suspects\". (Believe me, there won't be the resources.) But monitoring is not about snooping on individuals - it's about collecting evidence for developing policy and managing change.</p> <p>Glancey is incredulous that transport emissions and diet should be monitored. Yet most residents of new developments have to drive to get to any facilities. They generally have poor access to fresh, healthy, local food. Ecotowns have to be designed differently to be worthy of their name, so why not see if diet does change with more allotments and local retailers? We need to know if health really improves in a walkable town. These are lessons which could be applied way beyond 10 ecotowns.</p> <p>His belief, of course, is that monitoring equates with intrusive regulation of our personal lives. Nonsense. Without checking, for instance, how would we know that when people move into the German ecosuburb of Vauban, most choose to forgo their \"right\" to park outside their house in favour of a largely car-free environment that children can treat as one big playground? If that's \"illiberal\", count me in.</p> <p>Glancey also accuses our organisation of hypocrisy - of \"encouraging\" a new Tesco which will undermine the sustainability of his home town. As the government's design advisers, our commission reviews hundreds of schemes a year of all types. This particular store offers a better design than the many other Tesco stores that we have slammed. Improved architecture doesn't make the contents any more or less acceptable. Whether it should be built at all is, rightly, a decision for the local community.</p> <p>No one is pretending this is easy. But a blithe assertion that \"every town used to be an ecotown\" ignores medieval famine, industrial grimness and the practical realities of today.</p> <p>We need to challenge our existing habits and the default position of developers and government alike. We need to have the courage to test different approaches (in new and existing places). And, funnily enough, we'll need to check and see if all of this is making any difference.</p> <p>\u2022 Matt Bell is director of campaigns for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment <a href=\"mailto:mbell@cabe.org.uk\">mbell@cabe.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A remarkable 10,000 people marched on Trafalgar Square at the weekend to hold the government to its promise to end child poverty. Planned long ago, its message was suddenly more poignant as government revenues shrink and bank-rolling banks takes top priority. As all these parents and prams marched past the Treasury, the irony will not have been lost on many inside. The poverty of people like these is directly to blame for the day of reckoning now thundering in on us all. Who caused this crash? People too poor to pay their rent, let alone mortgages, people in mobile homes whose imaginary income streams were securitised into the toxic products that now choke the arteries of banks.</p> <p>An 8% stockmarket fall was a terrifying spectacle for the new National Economic Council - the war cabinet - meeting for the first time yesterday, but let's not forget the awful poetic justice being played out here. It is the extremes of inequality in the west's most unequal countries that set off this nuclear explosion. Gargantuan bonuses in Wall Street and the City were earned from creating fairy money, imagined to be owned by people too poor to pay anything at all. If the poor had more money, it wouldn't have happened. If mega-bonuses had not inflated share prices and borrowing beyond reason, fantasy capitalism would have been avoided. </p> <p>In the boom decade, defenders of the hyper-rich said there was no connection between earnings at the top and at the bottom. Top City earners, interviewed for my book Unjust Rewards, were breathtaking in their certainty that they were creating wealth for all. They were sure their own hermetically sealed world neither impacted on anyone else nor was vulnerable to anyone else: all criticism was envy or communism. Now they are taking everyone down with them, putting pensions, jobs and homes in peril for millions. </p> <p>There is, however, no sign of remorse. Sir Martin Sorrell just moved the tax domicile of his WPP advertising colossus to Dublin to avoid British taxes. He will not be moving there himself, nor will many staff. He prefers London, just as he likes a British knighthood. The company is now incorporated in Jersey, which has no corporation tax, and has a tax residence in Ireland. So is he the object of official criticism? On the contrary, he has just been appointed as chair of Boris Johnson's international business advisory council to encourage companies to locate in London. After a six-hour meeting of the council's 35 company chairmen, Johnson emerged to warn that other enterprises might move overseas, \"where they feel tax demands are fairer\".</p> <p>But whose fairness? Gordon Brown says from now on, fairness will be his defining mission: he has another chance this week to start all over again, as he says again it's time for change. Parliament has returned after a long summer to a changed world with worst-case possibilities of horrendous proportions. Just-in-time food delivery, paid for with what? If banks stop paying, just as they have stopped lending, nationalising the entire banking system for a while is no longer absurd. Unlikely? Yes, but its the kind of possibility all governments are staring in the face. The question is whether this government can shape the changed landscape and frame the language of this moment. </p> <p>Brown has this last opportunity to send the right signals, to indicate that the future needs to be done differently. It is not altogether reassuring that Brown, like Johnson, has appointed an advisory council of all the masters of the universe who brought this Armageddon on us, to help get us out of it. He has put them in a strong position to resist the necessary radical reforms. Just as finance houses need an entirely different cadre of people as non-executives on their boards to end the disastrous era of insiders overseeing one another, so the government needs to turn to other advisers to clean up the City and end performance-related pay. Who needs extra just to do their job?</p> <p>Peter Mandelson may choke on a recantation of his famous \"relaxed about the filthy rich\" remark, but he should remember his oft-forgotten rider - \"so long as they pay their taxes\". If Brown means fairness, a royal commission on tax needs to reform the gross injustice of who pays what: it will be felt more bitterly in the bad days ahead. The rich pay least, the poor most, so take from the top to lift the low-paid out of tax altogether. Tax breaks for the wealthy are far too generous, and a land value tax would prevent another property bubble. The rich disguise earnings as capital gains, so income tax and CGT need to be aligned again. Council tax is regressive, unfair and hated. Sadly international action now seems remote, but Britain has the power to close down the many tax havens it administers: days of turning a blind eye to offshore activities are over. (De Gaulle turned off Monaco's water to get his way.) </p> <p>No honours should go to anyone who has not paid fair taxes in Britain: the culture of tax avoidance has to change, and shame is a powerful weapon. Goodness knows how bad things will get, but a government that stands for transparent fairness has a better chance of surviving the wrath of millions who may be about to suffer greatly. And if well-pensioned top public servants seem feather-bedded when others lose their jobs, stop any of them earning above the prime minister's \u00a3189,000.</p> <p>Brendan Barber called yesterday for the misery to be shared fairly. The minimum wage has just gone up to \u00a35.72, which for the second year running is a real-terms cut, rising by less than inflation and well below the living wage of \u00a37.45. Pay has barely risen for 80% of people in three years, while for a third of families incomes have fallen for five years. When unemployment bites harder, everything changes. </p> <p>Yesterday Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth took the government to court for failing to implement its act of 2000 binding it to cut numbers living in fuel poverty\": this winter five million are expected to be unable to afford their bills. It is admirable that the government set its fuel poverty target in law, and it's even more admirable that Brown now promises to make his child poverty target legally binding too. But the danger is always that in bad times the poor go to the back of the queue while the rich are appeased. </p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is the author, with David Walker, of Unjust Rewards <br><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>My home town of Sheffield is to fish-and-chip shops what London is to banks. While at Harvard, I used to start my lectures on the financial sector in developing countries by explaining the difference between them. A good fish-and-chip shop makes its money by adding value to the fish and potatoes that it buys. A good bank makes its money in the same way, on the margin between the money it borrows and the money it lends. </p> <p>But now comes the difference. A criminal can safely be put in charge of a fish-and-chip shop but not of a bank. The former has virtually no assets: if the criminal runs off with the day's fish he cannot retire to Bermuda. But a criminal banker can make a fortune if only he can loot the money that the bank has borrowed: the returns from criminality dwarf running the bank well. </p> <p>In an ideal world the criminals would run fish-and-chip shops, where they could do no harm, and the honest would run the banks. But the market will allocate people in precisely the opposite way: the criminals will move heaven and earth to get into the banks, while the honest will not mind much which job they take. That is why vigilant public scrutiny is essential to prevent looting. </p> <p>Vigilant public scrutiny is, of course, precisely what we have not had. In its absence the business model of our financial sector, while not literally criminal, has been to tap our wealth in its custody by shifting it into opaque assets for high fees. Manifestly, wealth-owners did not adequately understand what was going on. We had been lulled into misplaced trust by decades of regulation-enforced decent behaviour.</p> <p>The regulation which had worked well enough was dismantled because of the recent mantra that finance is the engine of growth as long as it is given free rein. Hence Gordon Brown's emasculation of financial regulation in the UK and Alan Greenspan's era of neglect in the US. This mantra radically exaggerates the upside potential of finance. At best, the contribution of the financial sector to the growth of an economy is second order: it facilitates the creativity of other sectors. Only at its worst is finance first order: as we are now seeing, it can be catastrophic. </p> <p>Self-evidently, in a healthy society the brightest young minds should be heading for those parts of the economy that are truly first order. In Germany the brightest and best have been attracted to critical sectors such as the railways, which is why they function so brilliantly. In Britain the brightest and best have been attracted to the banks, which is why they so brilliantly looted our wealth. Meanwhile, with talentless management our real economy has lurched from failure to failure: from major cock-ups such as the opening of Heathrow's Terminal Five, to trivial such as the three hours taken by my train yesterday from Oxford to London. </p> <p>At last, we have a chance for change. Because the banks do well out of secrecy, to date they have successfully opposed proper scrutiny. The wall of secrecy started to crack after September 11, 2001, when governments forced banks to reveal deposits linked to the finance of terrorism. Incredibly, even that was resisted: Citibank lobbied hard to block it. But now that we have the banks on the run there is an opportunity to extend scrutiny, not only to help ourselves, but to help Africa. </p> <p>The loot-seeking elites that control parts of Africa illicitly send capital out of the region to the tune of $20 to $28bn per year. Illicit money flows are hard to quantify, but this is the new estimate by Raymond Baker of the NGO Global Financial Integrity, the most careful and ingenious study to date. Capital flight of this magnitude is roughly equivalent to the entire aid inflow to the region, so closing it would generate a similar resource transfer to doubling aid. One side-effect of the financial crisis is that aid commitments will be at the front of the queue for spending cuts. For example, in the vice-presidential debate it was the only Democratic spending pledge that Joe Biden suggested might be rethought. </p> <p>While the crisis will weaken our assistance for the poorest countries by curtailing aid, it could inadvertently have an offsetting effect if we use it to close the illicit outflow. Money flows out of Africa into our banks, and into the offshore banks that depend for their existence upon being able to transact with our banks. US rules on banking transparency are even weaker than the European rules: vast sums looted from the public purse in Africa are being held in nominee accounts and moved around the world at greater speed than our cumbersome legal processes can track them down. </p> <p>Western legal systems are stacked, thanks to the hired hands of skilled lawyers, to protect the rights of the crooked over the rights of Africa's ordinary citizens. At the time of the Commission for Africa, I urged that Britain revise its laws on banking secrecy. Yet despite the enormous emotional energy aroused by Gleneagles, there was no political appetite: aid, yes; banking openness, no. The silver lining in this grim cloud is that we have a second chance to clean up the banks. Which takes me back to where I began. There is one thing that a dirty fish-and-chip shop and a dirty bank have in common: they both stink.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Collier directs the Centre for the Study of African Economies at Oxford University and is the author of The Bottom Billion </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The government last night moved to intervene in the race row convulsing Britain's biggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/police\">police force</a>, after black officers announced they were in open rebellion. </p> <p>The Metropolitan Black Police Association began a formal boycott of the Metropolitan police yesterday, saying the force was so riddled with discrimination that ethnic minorities should not apply to join it.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, last night responded with a nationwide assessment of how ethnic minorities are treated by the police. </p> <p>Smith, who expressed disappointment with the boycott by black police officers, said the police minister, Vernon Coaker, would carry out a rapid, two-week examination of the recruitment and promotion prospects of minorities. </p> <p>\"We need a police service which understands the communities it serves and represents those communities and the whole country,\" she said.</p> <p>The announcement followed an inquiry ordered by London mayor Boris Johnson into the issues raised by the BPA, and also comes after a BBC Panorama programme revealed widespread dissatisfaction among ethnic minority officers.</p> <p>The programme surveyed BPA members and found that 72% claimed to have experienced racism at work, 60% felt their career had been hindered by their race, 61% said things had stayed the same or got worse in recent years. </p> <p>Mike Fuller, Britain's first black chief constable, told the programme he and other ethnic minority officers had to work twice as hard as white people.</p> <p>Black community leaders also said yesterday that the race row, which first flared when Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur was suspended after alleging discrimination, was damaging confidence in the capital's police.</p> <p>Outside the force, senior black community figures say the discontent among ethnic minority officers is damaging the police's reputation with communities in London. </p> <p>Claudia Webbe, who works with the police, chairing an independent advisory group on Operation Trident, which tackles gun crime, said it was \"damaging black community confidence and trust in the police\".</p> <p>\"There is already concern about excessive stop and search. That, coupled with how the police treat their own BME [black and minority ethnic] officers, does not generate the level of confidence in the community about policing in London,\" she added.</p> <p>The boycott won support from the Society of Black Lawyers, whose chairman, Peter Herbert, said: \"Wherever we can, we will tell people not to join the Met until this is resolved.\" </p> <p>But it was opposed by the Association of Muslim Police. Superintendent Dal Babu said: \"The Association of Muslim Police and the National Association of Muslim Police currently support Metropolitan police recruitment events.\"</p> <p>London's mayor, Boris Johnson, yesterday attended his first meeting as chairman of the Metropolitan police authority. His plan for a separate inquiry headed by the MPA deputy chair, Cindy Butts, ran into trouble as members called for a more independent inquiry.</p> <p>Johnson said the inquiry would examine the promotion of ethnic minority officers, relations between the BPA and the Met leadership and how the force handled race and faith issues. He promised to review how independent it should be. </p> <p>Johnson also defended his meeting last week with Sir Ian Blair, which led to the resignation of Britain's top officer. He claimed he had consulted widely before telling Blair he should stand down. A show of hands by the MPA's members suggested most had not been spoken to.</p>",
  "<p>Joshua \"Ben\" Jeyaretnam, who has died aged 82, was for many years Singapore's only political opposition, standing courageously for universal values of fairness and free speech against Lee Kuan Yew's \"Asian values\" of hierarchical order, public submissiveness and government by the fittest - that is himself, his son and his People's Action party (PAP). Jeyaretnam, as leader of the Workers' party, was regularly persecuted, briefly imprisoned and ultimately bankrupted by colonial libel and contempt laws, but he continued his struggle to make Singapore a more open society. </p> <p>Born into an Anglican family of Christian-Tamil descent in then Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), he was educated at St Andrew's school, Singapore, during the Japanese occupation and won, via a correspondence course, a place to study law at University College London. There, a lecture by Nye Bevan inspired his early socialist beliefs. They were put on hold while he developed a successful legal practice back in Singapore, where he became increasingly angered by the PAP government's attacks on trade unions. So in 1971 he made his political move, joining the Workers' party, which was at that time moribund through lack of effective leadership.</p> <p>His first electoral attempts failed, but his mild criticisms of the government, delivered in a deep and booming voice from the hustings, infuriated Lee Kuan Yew, who in 1978 attempted to crush him with a libel case. In court, with the help of his wife, dying of cancer, and of John Mortimer QC acting pro bono, Ben survived, albeit much poorer from the libel damages, to fight another day. That day came in 1981, when the electors of the constituency of Anson stood up to PAP threats to cut their public utilities and elected Ben as Singapore's first opposition MP.</p> <p>This victory was the trigger for a long-running campaign to diminish and then destroy him. He was forced to pay the Kuan Yews and other PAP grandees for criticisms that would scarcely raise eyebrows in real democracies, and was fined for contempt of parliament for making allegations of the kind commonly made by MPs in other countries: he estimated he had paid out more than 1.6m Singapore dollars in damages and costs. His bankruptcies disqualified him for several periods from parliament and no shops would stock his books: he was forced to sell them on street corners. </p> <p>Ironically, it was the PAP government's obsession with destroying - rather than merely defeating - its opponents which led it to overplay its hand. Not content with having him convicted, bankrupted, and expelled from parliament, its obsession with humiliating him led it in 1987 to take away his right to practise law. But it failed to notice an obscure clause in the Legal Practitioners Act, which permitted an appeal by a debarred solicitor to the privy council in London.</p> <p>It was there that the whole trumped-up series of charges against Ben unravelled. The English law lords reviewed the case and voiced a devastating condemnation of the Singapore judges who had handled it, expressing \"deep disquiet that by a series of misjudgments\" Ben and his co-accused had suffered a grievous injustice. </p> <p>The Singapore government responded by abolishing all appeals to the privy council, and still adamantly refuses to sign any human rights treaty which would permit any more decisions of its courts to be appealed to an international tribunal. But the privy council judgment in Jeyaretnam's case still resounds, as a warning to other judges tempted to fail in their task of standing up for the subject against the state.</p> <p>For the last 40 years, Ben pointed out Singapore's democratic deficit. His speeches were not properly reported in the Straits Times, and any foreign newspaper that interviewed him risked having its circulation cut to 400 copies and sold only in tourist hotels. His voice was loudest in 1988 when Lee and son (the latter as home affairs minister) detained for two years without trial 20 young Catholic youth workers, lawyers and playwrights accused of participation in a \"Marxist plot\". </p> <p>They were tortured by use of what Lee junior (now Singapore's prime minister) described as \"psychological pressure\" to extract confessions - dressed in cotton pyjamas, they were blasted for hours with freezing cold air conditioners. With organisations such as Amnesty banned from Singapore, Ben's voice was important in exposing the cruelty of their treatment. </p> <p>Ben felt that many western criticisms of Singapore were misplaced. They focused on laws against jay-walking, urinating in public and dropping chewing gum wrappers. The real concern was that the PAP had turned the city state into an ersatz democracy by suppressing well-intentioned dissent, and even the reporting of such dissent, in order to maintain its monopoly of power. His views were set out in a book in 2003 by Chris Lydgate that serves as his biography: Lee's Law - How Singapore Crushes Dissent.</p> <p>Ben was never in any realistic sense Lee's rival for national leadership. With his tailored waistcoat, watch chain and mutton-chop whiskers, he looked the model of a Gladstonian Liberal, but voters who wanted their monorails to run on time preferred PAP precision to the shambolic Workers' party. Nonetheless, the persecution he stoically suffered gave his life a significance it would not otherwise have had. </p> <p>The PAP, which has ruled Singapore since 1965, still holds 82 of the 84 elected seats in parliament. Ben lost his seat in 2001, bankrupt again because he could not pay another $367,000 libel judgment to Lee and son. </p> <p>However, on emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year, he helped to form the Reform party and announced that he would once again stand for parliament, in an attempt to give Singapore \"rights that are most essential to our well-being: the right to speak up freely, the right to tell the government that the way things are going is wrong\".</p> <p>Ben's wife, Margaret, whom he met when studying law in London, died in 1980. He is survived by two sons, Kenneth, an economist, and Philip, a poet and president of the Law Society of Singapore. The privy council's recommendation that the Singapore government make amends for his wrongful conviction has, of course, been ignored. </p> <p>A future generation will understand that Ben deserves not only to be pardoned, but to be honoured. </p> <p>\u2022 Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, lawyer and politician, born January 5 1926; died September 30 2008</p>",
  "<p>Young children should not keep hamsters, baby chicks, lizards, turtles or hedgehogs as pets, according to the leading US paediatricians' group, in a new report about dangers from exotic animals.</p> <p>Besides evidence that they can carry dangerous and sometimes potentially deadly germs, exotic pets may be more prone than cats and dogs to bite, scratch or claw ... putting children younger than five particularly at risk, the report says.</p> <p>Young children are vulnerable because of developing immune systems, plus they often put their hands in their mouths.

  "<p>I am walking down the corridors of Sir John Cass secondary school in Tower Hamlets and it feels very weird. I am not dodging missiles, hearing abuse or witnessing scraps between children. This seems a totally different school from the one I taught at during the early 1990s; there isn't a fight in sight, not a shred of litter and the school now has some of the best results in the country, instead of the worst. </p> <p>Since Sir John Cass is near where I live, in east London, I am thinking about sending my son here when he is old enough in a few years' time. Its recent Ofsted report rated the school as \"outstanding\" and it is considered to be one of the most improved schools in the country. So here I am at the annual open morning, listening to the headteacher, Haydn Evans, as he guides parents around the site, describing the school's \"faith-based\" ethos and firm discipline. </p> <p>Everything we see in the classrooms confirms this. As we are walking around viewing the gleaming new facilities, a smart-suited parent tells me that a lot of his friends have moved to the countryside in search of good schools, but now he realises that they wasted their time. \"This school seems far better than any of the ropey old comps in the suburbs!\" he chortles. </p> <p>Many of the parents are anxious, asking questions about the school's results, how it deals with bullying, its extra-curricular classes. I am very familiar with their concerns because as a teacher I have fielded numerous similar questions during open days since leaving Sir John Cass secondary. </p> <p>At the comprehensive where I am currently a head of department, I watch the parents stalking around, clutching their bewildered children and their notebooks. They could be intoning the mantra: \"We're going on a school hunt, we're going on a school hunt!\" Their eyes scan every gleaming piece of display work, every book they can lay their hands on, every computer, every Bunsen burner. </p> <p>This is the open day season for year 5 and 6 parents. Many parents are bamboozled by the process. Most boroughs will hold evenings at primary schools explaining the complex processes involved, but many parents remain confused. Few understand properly the admissions rules for secondary schools, and fewer know how to spot a good school, preferring to rely on myths rather than facts. </p> <p>Before parents start schlepping around lots of schools, it is worth spending a few minutes on the internet. Log on to <a href=\"http://schoolsfinder.direct.gov.uk\">schoolsfinder.direct.gov.uk</a> and, simply by typing in your postcode, you can see which your local schools are. You can read the Ofsted report on each, which will provide an overall judgment on the school. The Ofsted report will be more reliable than reading the raw data in the league tables, which won't take account of the type of pupils entering the school. </p> <p>Some believe that open days can be misleading. \"Parents should make sure they go along during lessons and see how the teachers behave towards the pupils,\" suggests Huda al Bander, 19, a veteran of London comprehensives and colleges. Al Bander is among a group of teenagers belonging to the Edge Learner Forum, a unique organisation working to promote practical learning in schools. </p> <p>\"A good school is a school where you will see teachers not only talking to the whole class but also working one-to-one with the pupils, listening to their questions and not putting them down,\" she says. And \"good schools cater to pupils' different learning styles, and the best schools get the right balance between practical learning and theory\". Increasingly, educationalists are realising that pupils learn effectively in different ways and need chances to learn through dance, drama, art, music and doing presentations. </p> <p>Edge Learner Forum members warn against selecting a school just because the child's friends are going there. \"They are only 11 and they will make new friends very easily.\" </p> <p>I have spoken to several parents who have sent their child to schools precisely because their friends are not there. Don't be blackmailed by your child on this issue. Choose the best school, not the most sociable one.</p> <p>Many parents are confused by the number of different types of secondary school that exist: academies, city technology colleges, specialist schools, special schools, faith schools, local community schools, pupil referral units. </p> <p>The differences between them may be many, but the essential point is that they should all be judged on the same criteria: their academic record, particularly in English and maths; their most recent Ofsted report; the behaviour and attitude of the pupils; and their extra-curricular provision. </p> <p>The final decision should rest with the parent, but it is worth involving your child in extended conversations about where they should go to school, discussing with them your ambitions and hopes. Keep the conversation positive. </p> <p><strong>Negative opinions</strong></p> <p>Equally, if you realise that your child is going to be sent to a school that you think is rubbish, you should try to keep your most negative opinions to yourself because they could affect your child's whole experience of the school. This is going to be increasingly important because 21% of parents don't get their first choice of school. The government recently changed the law by which schools can admit students so that the majority of parents will have to choose from schools in their local catchment area. The rules remain complicated and there are some exceptions. Most important is to read the admissions criteria very carefully. </p> <p>During the open evening, it is worth listening to the admissions part of the headteacher's speech and getting him or her, or someone else in the know, to explain it to you again if you don't understand it. This could save you an enormous amount of time and effort later: the last thing you want is to apply for a school at which your child can't possibly gain a place. Your open evening may be the last chance you have to talk to someone in the know about admissions criteria. </p> <p>Finally, once you've chosen your schools, make sure you fill in the forms correctly. Some schools - faith schools in particular - require that you send an application to them and one to the local education authority, while other schools require you to apply only through the local education authority. Again, checking this at an open evening saves much agony.</p> <p>It is also worth finding out the best way to rank your schools on your form. Many local authorities, including all those in London, operate a policy of offering one school place only, giving parents their highest ranked school with places. This means that if a parent has put top of their list two schools for which their child does not meet the criteria, they will be offered a place at the third school if they meet enough of the criteria there. Should you be given a third place, but you are not very happy about it, you can appeal to the first two schools. If you don't meet the criteria for any of the schools on your list, you will be given the nearest school to your house with spare places \u2014 often a very unpopular school which is miles away.</p> <p><strong>Happy hunting</strong></p> <p>The main thing to remember is that ultimately it is not the school that makes the real difference: it is the parents. Even if your child goes to a school you would never have chosen, given the right support at home he or she will succeed. However, if you do hunt down a good school and get your child into it, you'll be saving yourself much work and stress in the long run. If your child is not being properly taught, you'll need to fill in the gaps by either teaching them yourself or hiring private tutors. Happy hunting and good luck.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Francis Gilbert teaches English at a mixed-sex comprehensive in outer London. His book, Parent Power: The Complete Guide to Getting the Best Education For Your Child, is published by Piatkus</p> <h2>Killer questions for the open day</h2> <p><strong>Ask teachers: </strong></p> <p>Would you send your child to this school? <br>What would you do if I complained that my child was being bullied? <br>How does the school cater for gifted and talented children? <br>What evidence can you show me that my child will be stretched? <br>How does it cater for children with learning difficulties? <br>What would you do if I complained about the quality of teaching? </p> <p><strong>Ask pupils:</strong></p> <p>What level/grades are you in English/maths/science? <br>What do you have to do to improve in these subjects? <br>What are the best things about lessons? <br>What are the worst? <br>How well behaved are the children? <br>What does the school do with bullies and disruptive pupils? <br>What are the dinners like and are the toilets kept nicely?</p> <h2>League tables: which bits are important?</h2> <p><strong>Read with caution</strong></p> <p>Don't trust the school league tables fully. The fiasco of this year's Sats, which meant that many papers were not marked properly or went missing, will delay some league tables by several months, the government announced last week. But even the league tables that were published this year need to be read with caution. To use them properly you will need to look behind the headline figures. In particular, check the maths and English scores at GCSE. If the school is getting below 50% A*-C grades in these subjects, it means that more than half the pupils are not leaving school with the required minimum standards. This may not be a problem in a school where the majority of children have English as an additional language, but if that is not the case, be wary. Look also at the numbers of children gaining five \"good\" GCSEs: in English, maths, the sciences, and modern foreign languages (MFL). Some schools may not offer much in the way of languages or sciences at GCSE. They should. At Sir John Cass, all the top achieving students are given the chance to study \"triple\" science - physics, chemistry and biology - and a host of languages.</p> <p><strong>Check the value-added scores</strong></p> <p>Does the school add \"value\" to the pupils? Schools that score below 100 on the league table present a problem because they are not helping their students to learn at a rapid rate; the students are merely trotting along at their expected levels or below, and are not achieving over and above what they could achieve. </p> <p><strong>Find the Ofsted report</strong></p> <p>Do read a recent Ofsted report. They often give precious information about whether a school really makes a difference to a pupil's attainment. In particular, the Ofsted report will give a clear picture of the standards of teaching and learning in the school overall, rating it from 1-4, with 1 being outstanding, 2 being good, 3 being satisfactory and 4 being unsatisfactory. Any recent Ofsted report that rates the standards of teaching and learning as \"satisfactory\" or below indicates that the school is a bit mediocre. Similarly, the Ofsted report will give a ranking from 1-4 on the school's overall effectiveness, the behaviour of the pupils and a host of other areas. </p> <p><strong>Special educational needs</strong></p> <p>Check how many pupils are on the SEN register and the provision for them. If there are more than 40% of pupils on the SEN register, then I would investigate the school very carefully; this means that more than a third of pupils have learning difficulties. Does the school have the trained staff and SEN teachers to cope with so many SEN pupils? What facilities does it have to help them improve?</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Monday October 20 2008.

  "<p>In 1995, my son Justin Walinets, who has died aged 41, settled in San Vicente, a largely abandoned mountain-top village in La Rioja, Spain. He was a pioneer recycler, and he built a home whose facilities included a spring-water supply heated through fine piping coiled around insulating cow dung. He shared these innovations with the small artistic community that had settled there.</p> <p>Among its members was an American clown, Billy Wickland, and the two developed a partnership from which grew juggling acts, stilts, unicycles, amazing scrap-metal robots, escapology and fire-eating.</p> <p>They then connected with a community of artisans at local fairs and became the well-paid Saltimbanques, entertainers at the increasingly popular medieval fairs of Spain and Portugal. A Spanish Inquisition show was popular; another had Justin, within a huge dragon he had built, flames snorting from its nostrils, stomping through villages. Audiences of all ages loved him.</p> <p>Justin cultivated vegetables, tended chickens, constructed trailer-drawn machines to entertain audiences, and created scrap-material sculptures on the hillside which were much admired by the farmer-cum-landowner .</p> <p>Justin was always an adventurous and independent-minded youngster. We left Plymouth when he was 10, and he attended a comprehensive school in Wandsworth, south London, and, briefly, Richmond college. At 17, he decided to try life in the squatter community. It was the Thatcherite era of the 1980s, and mild anarchy seemed an attractive alternative to unemployment. He later joined some friends whose parents had allowed them a patch of land in Fairhaven, Sussex, to try living back to nature.</p> <p>I bought a 6ft unicycle from a family friend - a successful clown - and Justin quickly mastered that skill. A new breed of young travellers were living the simple life in tents and old buses, but eventually police harassment depressed him and he moved to France, his unicycle and tools behind him in an ancient ambulance and caravan. There he picked grapes, and took other odd jobs his skilful hands had mastered - including building a 30ft greenhouse for a grateful farmer.</p> <p>But there was a sad background to Justin life. He was diabetic and he sometimes overlooked his insulin dosages. After a solo gig in Pamplona, he was found in a coma by the police. He was treated well in the hospital de Navarra, then flown to Darlington hospital in England, but he was brain-damaged and never recovered consciousness. </p> <p>Justin lived only 41 years. But each year was equivalent to two years of the conventional lifestyle he so determinedly avoided. He is survived by his mother Ren\u00e9e and myself, and his older brothers, Joe and Karl.</p>",
  "<p>In a ground-breaking deal, the British construction company Balfour Beatty agreed yesterday to pay \u00a32.25m to settle bribery allegations over a \u00a3100m overseas contract. The company helped build the re-created Alexandria Library in Egypt in 2001, a prestigious Unesco project.</p> <p>The Serious Fraud Office, which has been investigating the firm for the past three years, has avoided the risk of losing a criminal trial but the exact allegations have been hushed up as a result. The SFO said yesterday: \"By proceeding in this way, the SFO has been able to impose a significant sanction on a major UK company whilst avoiding the extensive cost to the public purse of lengthy court proceedings.\"</p> <p>Both parties refused to depart from limited statements yesterday. But a prominent Egyptian consulting engineer, Mamdouh Hamza, told the Guardian from Cairo that he had been questioned by the SFO. His firm controlled the project, under which extra payments had been authorised in 2001. He denied handling bribes and said: \"No bribes whatever were paid to anyone in the project.\" Extra payments had been approved only for necessary additional work on the contract, he said.</p> <p>Hamza's involvement began in melodramatic circumstances. He was arrested in London in 2004 on his way to a Buckingham Palace garden party, after claims to British police that he was planning to have the Egyptian housing minister assassinated. While he was awaiting his Old Bailey trial, Balfour Beatty reported to the SFO \"irregularities\" in their Alexandria library project. Hamza was questioned by the SFO in 2005, he says. An Old Bailey jury eventually threw out the assassination-plot charge and Hamza says: \"The whole file was sent to the Egyptian government in 2005. They investigated and found there was no wrongdoing.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's statement from the SFO said that Balfour Beatty was voluntarily paying the \u00a32.25m and part of the SFO's legal costs, thanks to the agency's newly acquired asset-seizure powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The money was regarded as the fruit of \"unlawful conduct\" because the firm was implicated in false accounting over the suspect payments: \"Having itself brought these matters to the attention of the SFO, Balfour Beatty plc has accepted that unlawful conduct, in the form of inaccurate accounting records arising from certain payment irregularities, occurred within a subsidiary entity ... The documentation prepared in connection with these payments did not comply with the requirements for accurate business records to be kept in accordance with ... [the] Companies Act 1985.\"</p> <p>Observers of the SFO's largely unavailing struggles for seven years to crack down on corruption were heartened by yesterday's outcome. One well-informed legal observer said: \"This is a good result, particularly because it focuses on the question of false accounting by companies. It would have been difficult to prosecute in any event because the events took place before Britain's anti-overseas bribery legislation came into force in 2002.\"</p> <p>The SFO said Balfour Beatty had been let off lightly because it cooperated. Richard Alderman, the SFO's director, said: \"This is a highly significant development in our efforts to reform British corporate behaviour. We now have a range of enforcement tools at our disposal.\"</p> <p>Balfour Beatty said: \"There is no suggestion of any improper overall commercial advantage accruing to the company nor any financial advantage being gained by any individual employee.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bank executives responsible for reckless lending should be punished under criminal law and face fines, according to a politician who rescued Sweden's banking system from collapse in the 1990s. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Bo L\u00fcndgren, director general of Sweden's national debt office, the country's financial regulator, said US proposals to cap bankers' pay as part of the $700bn bail-out did not go far enough. </p> <p>He said laws should be introduced in the US and Europe making it a criminal offence for bankers to lend irresponsibly. He also proposed that banks should be made subject to legally-binding guidelines on lending. L\u00fcndgren was Sweden's finance minister in the early 1990s when a property slump put the economy into recession. </p> <p>\"In the US, the bail-out's condition on capping executive pay is for show,\" he said. \"Legislation should be introduced so that if any bank is lending recklessly, executives could be punished by criminal law or be forced to pay damages.\"</p> <p>He criticised Ireland's decision to offer a 100% guarantee to protect deposits. \"I was astonished by what the Irish government has done,\" he said. \"This distorts competition and the integration of capital markets across Europe. If one country in Europe offers a blanket guarantee, it puts pressure on everyone else to do the same.\" To stave off a collapse in Sweden, L\u00fcndgren nationalised banks in return for taking on their toxic loans.</p> <p>The total cost of the bail-out was \u00a36bn most of which, he said, has been recovered by selling stakes in the banks. </p> <p>He said the UK should not follow the US example of buying up banks' toxic assets without taking stakes in them. \"You will never win an election for measures to support banks but taking stakes in banks would be more popular. This is because taxpayers stand to gain in the future if the banks' share prices rise.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany's</a> go-it-alone decision to prevent a run on its banks by guaranteeing up to \u20ac1 trillion of individuals' deposits was followed yesterday by several other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU countries</a>. </p> <p>But the rush to take unilateral action underlined a sense of disarray among EU governments over the crisis and the difficulties of drafting joint action. </p> <p>Amid bitter recriminations about Berlin's shock move on Sunday, Spain indicated that it could soon join Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland and Sweden in offering a full government guarantee for deposits. </p> <p>But Germany rowed back slightly, insisting that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was not offering a full state guarantee to all banks - just to private depositors.</p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the current EU president, insisted that EU leaders were acting together and would separately and collectively do whatever was necessary to ensure financial stability.</p> <p>Sarkozy and Gordon Brown spoke to Merkel by phone, requesting an explanation of the German action. The French president was also prompted to try to reassert control over a crisis spiralling out of control. \"No depositor in the banks of our countries has suffered losses and we will continue to take the necessary measures to protect the system as well as depositors,\" an Elys\u00e9e statement said later. </p> <p>\"In taking these measures, European leaders confirm the necessity of a close coordination and cooperation.\"</p> <p>But the attempt at damage limitation contrasted with growing disarray among European governments. This was highlighted when the Italian premier, Silvio Berlusconi, read out the same statement in Rome earlier as if it were his own and he were acting on the EU's behalf.</p> <p>Spain was enraged at being left out of Saturday's emergency summit of British, French, German and Italian leaders when its banks have proven safe so far, and demanded talks for its prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, with Sarkozy in Paris this week. Zapatero held an emergency meeting with leading bankers in Madrid last night.</p> <p>\"There's already been criticism of a unilateral approach and we may hear more of it,\" a senior EU diplomat said ahead of today's meeting of the EU's 27 finance ministers in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Pedro Solbes, the Spanish finance minister and a former EU commissioner, said: \"I would have preferred that no member country took decisions unilaterally which are always negative. </p> <p>\"If each country maintains its position, we'll have to look at the impact it's having on Spain.\"</p> <p>Johannes Leitenberger, chief European commission spokesman, repeatedly declared that a collective EU response remained in place yesterday, but effectively gave carte blanche for the EU's 27 countries to mount their own schemes to stop panicky depositors taking their money out of banks.</p> <p>He said there were no objections to the German and other enhanced deposit schemes - apart from the Irish plan which is viewed as discriminatory since it provides blanket guarantees for banks' entire liabilities and could exclude non-Irish banks.</p> <p>The European commission indicated that it would prepare rushed legislation to revise a 1994 law that sets a minimum \u20ac20,000 deposit guarantee throughout the EU, raising the ceiling and ensuring speedier payouts.</p> <p>A proposal is likely after today's meeting of EU finance ministers and a full EU summit in Brussels early next week at which Europe's leaders will try to contain the contagion sweeping across the Atlantic to engulf several European banks.</p> <p>Finance ministers of the 15-strong eurogroup met to prepare a collective response last night amid continuing divisions over a Dutch demand for a pan-European bank bail-out fund of around \u20ac300bn to match the US scheme approved by Congress last week.</p> <p>Giulio Tremonti, the Italian finance minister, pushed for the scheme which has had initial support from the French but was given \"a pretty comprehensive thumbs-down\" from Saturday's summit, diplomats said.</p> <p>Germany is preparing for a general election next year and is allergic to the very notion of a pan-EU fund since, as the traditional paymaster, it fears shelling out to save other countries' banks.</p> <p>With popular disgust mounting over the mismatch between the abject performance of the financial system and rewards for top bankers, ministers are debating collective measures to curb boardroom pay.</p> <p>\"A key issue is whether incentives in remuneration structures may have encouraged executives to focus on short-term profit targets rather than on the sustainable profitability of companies,\" a European commission memo said. </p> <p>Senior EU officials have accused investment bankers of simply piling up ultra-risky investments from September in order to maximise their Christmas bonuses.</p> <p>EU governments are also seeking to step up pan-European supervision of cross-border big banks in difficulties, but are at odds over French-inspired plans to establish a single EU regulator and other proposals for a \"college\" of supervisors.</p>",
  "<p>A group of governors got a rocky reception in the media last week as the debate over a mass immunisation plan against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) spilled into education.</p> <p>\"The governors of this school are no longer competent to be in post and should be dismissed,\" wrote a contributor to a newspaper forum after governors of St Monica's RC high school in Bury, Greater Manchester, refused to allow the jabs to take place on school premises.</p> <p>The government is spending \u00a3100m on a programme that eventually aims to vaccinate all girls aged between 14 and 18, and it wants the three successive injections to be administered in schools.</p> <p>St Monica's governors wrote to parents with daughters aged 12 to 13 saying the vaccine only protects against 70% of cervical cancers and detailing possible side-effects. But were the governors legally able to make such a decision?</p> <p>The Guide to the Law for School Governors states: \"At all maintained schools the governing body controls the use of premises both during and outside of school hours. There may be exceptions to this at voluntary aided, voluntary controlled and foundation or foundation special schools if a trust deed says that someone else has control of the use of premises.\" Meanwhile, the schools secretary, Ed Balls, issued a veiled criticism of St Monica's: \"Schools should be at the centre of their community and I don't think schools walking away from their responsibility for children's health is the way to go.\"</p> <p>John Allen, a parish priest and governor at the school, said: \"This is primarily a public health issue, not a school issue. That's the reason we came to the decision as governors. We're saying it's such an important issue that parents should make that decision in consultation with their family doctor.\"</p> <p>However, the immunisation scheme is understood to be being carried out through school medical services, provided and funded by the NHS and usually delivered by primary care trusts. The protocol is for medical professionals to make arrangements with headteachers - not governing bodies. </p> <p>The head of St Monica's, Frank McCarron, has so far not commented on the governors' decision.</p> <p>Under the Education (Schools Premises) Regulations 1999, the school is responsible for providing adequate facilities and accommodation for medical inspections and treatment, for which parental consent is always required. </p> <p>So far, St Monica's has stood firm on its ban. It will be interesting to see what education chiefs do if other governing bodies decide to follow its lead.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:education.governor@theguardian.com\">Education.governor@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Many changes are affecting western societies. New citizens are importing different cultural and religious traditions, families are taking on different configurations, work hours are becoming more varied and the internet is taking over our shopping, entertainment and information-gathering activities. As these changes occur they bring about paradoxes in how we lead our lives. People have become more conscious of individual rights, but are less deferential to those in authority. There is more consideration for children, old people and those with disabilities, but this is accompanied by the growth of new phenomena such as road rage and mob behaviour at bus stops. We participate in television and radio shows, yet show reluctance to cast our votes in elections.</p> <p>Changes in the way our society functions have implications for education. Yet English schools, despite the good work of the government-funded Innovations Unit, are slow to change. This is partly because their core task of teaching and caring for children has remained the same. But the move away from local authority control towards central government direction, tight regulation through Ofsted inspections and the pervasive influence of league tables inhibit all but the most confident of headteachers and governing bodies from experimenting with new approaches. Ironically, it is the most unproven of new categories of schools - academies - that have been given the most freedom to change. </p> <p>Of course, many schools value traditions and are proud of their focus on customary knowledge and time-honoured skills. But even if the essential nature of teaching and learning has not changed much since the 19th century, many aspects of schooling have. The ending of 11-plus selection in the majority of areas, the abolition of corporal punishment and the introduction of a national curriculum and Sats have made the daily experience of pupils today quite different from how it was when I was a boy. </p> <p>Other countries have changed too. Finland's 25-year move towards an equitable comprehensive system has been characterised by an upgrading in teachers' education, the adoption of mixed ability teaching and the introduction of special programmes for children with reading difficulties. In Denmark, upper secondary schools are shifting from traditional academic subjects to a radical new interdisciplinary approach. In Flemish Belgium, an education council, composed of stakeholders, has been given the right to comment on proposed legislation. Nearer home, Wales is experimenting with the development of its own baccalaureate. </p> <p>But should there be more fundamental changes in how pupils are educated in order to better match the way people live today? Should issues such as the sustainability of the environment and the dangers of obesity, drugs and Aids and, in the light of current events, financial education be given more prominence? And should school leaders try to predict which other issues might affect their pupils' future lives?</p> <p>The 21st Century Learning Alliance - a body chaired by Tim Brighouse - argues that heads and teachers need to spend time thinking about future trends and how to prepare for them. This makes sense, but will only lead to increased frustration unless the government re-learns to trust the teaching profession. Of course, accountability must remain and monitoring must be deployed to prevent pupils suffering the effects of ill thought-out schemes. But, if we are going to change teaching more fundamentally, we need some bold experiments to guide us. Two years ago an NUT publication proposed that each local authority should set up an experimental school to form a national network. Now is the time to put this idea into practice.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Mortimore is a former director of the Institute of Education</p>",
  "<p>Citigroup and Wells Fargo agreed last night to a temporary ceasefire in the battle for control of the struggling US bank Wachovia after intensive efforts by federal regulators to forge a three-way agreement.</p> <p>The rivals said they would halt litigation until noon tomorrow over their respective takeover bids for Wachovia, which has been brought to its knees by billions of dollars in mortgage-related liabilities.</p> <p>Backed by a government guarantee, Citigroup last week believed it had sealed a $2.2bn (\u00a31.2bn) offer for much of Wachovia until Friday, when Wells Fargo swooped in with a $15bn agreed bid for the entire company.</p> <p>Angry at being gazumped, Citigroup sought an order from the supreme court of New York state over the weekend to block Wells Fargo's offer. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is keen to find a compromise to avert the prospect of a damaging battle for Wachovia which could undermine the North Carolina-based group's already tenuous condition.</p> <p>One suggestion on the table is to divide Wachovia's network of 3,300 branches with Wells Fargo taking those in California and the south-east and Citigroup getting outlets in the north-east of the US.</p> <p>Court papers provide a glimpse into the true extent of Wachovia's problems. In a legal filing, Wachovia disclosed that when it agreed a deal in principle with Citigroup a week ago, it was within hours of being shut down by banking regulators.</p> <p>Wachovia said it spoke to Citigroup \"with the understanding that a seizure of its banking assets later that day by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp would occur\" unless it secured a takeover.</p> <p>A familiar name on US high streets, Wachovia was America's fourth biggest commercial bank by assets before the present industry shakeout began.</p> <p>It holds $447bn of deposits, serves 15 million customers and employs 120,000 people. It has run into trouble because of its vast book of risky mortgages known as \"option ARMs\" which were popular with cash-strapped borrowers because they permitted very low repayments.</p> <p>Citigroup maintains that by striking an 11th-hour deal with Wells Fargo, executives at Wachovia acted in bad faith and breached an agreement for exclusivity.</p> <p>Sources close to the saga said Citigroup has made it clear it would raise its offer to a level similar to Wells Fargo's, although it still wants the government to stand behind some of Wachovia's riskier assets.</p> <p>A prominent Wall Street hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, said he had been buying Wachovia stock heavily. Ackman, who rose to prominence by betting on Lehman Brothers' collapse, said he saw Wachovia as \"one of the more fascinating investment opportunities\" on the market.</p> <p>Paul Miller, analyst at stockbroker Friedman Billings Ramsay, said he believed Wells Fargo would secure Wachovia to create a \"national banking powerhouse\".</p> <p>\"Citigroup is attempting to enforce its exclusivity agreement for Wachovia or increase its offer, but we expect that Wells Fargo should eventually prevail,\" he said in a note to clients.</p> <p>So far this year, 13 high street banks have failed in the US including last month's collapse of Seattle-based Washington Mutual - the biggest retail banking collapse on record. As in Europe, regulators are keen to stem any erosion of public confidence in banks. In an unexpected twist, lawyers have suggested that an obscure clause in the US government's $700bn banking bail-out package could invalidate Citigroup's claim of exclusivity. The clause liberalises takeover talks between banks in an effort to lessen the likelihood of failures.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bank of America has struck an $8.4bn deal with law enforcement authorities to settle investigations into the conduct of Countrywide Financial, its newly acquired mortgage lender. Bank of America will modify mortgages for 400,000 people by reducing interest rates or cutting principal loan amounts.</p>",
  "<p>Uproar in schools again, this time over teachers who have affairs with pupils over 16, in the same school. Should they be prosecuted and put on the sex offenders register? The law and the NSPCC say yes, but Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, says no. She believes it's not a sexual offence, it's \"a serious error of professional misjudgment\". And she's right. </p> <p>But I do remember, when I was teaching music in a London comprehensive in the 70s, one particularly ghastly fellow who ought to have been sent to the slammer. He wore his shirt open to the waist, made vilely suggestive remarks to girl pupils, and was eventually sacked when one girl told her parents. Or was he? In those days it was difficult to sack a teacher. You had to lie and give them a good reference, so that the next school took the stinkers on. That is what had happened at our school, which didn't know he'd had an affair with a sixth-former at the previous school. Now it's easier to sack a teacher. Or perhaps it's too easy.</p> <p>I asked a teacher friend about this, who must be nameless. \"It's such a nervous area,\" he says. You dare not touch a girl, or a boy, for any reason whatsoever in a school. Pupils will start shouting paedophile, and everyone will believe them. That's another thing Keates is justifiably worried about: malicious allegations. I've been accused of assault, falsely, but in came the parents, ready to punch me on the nose. What would those parents do to a suspected sex offender? </p> <p>These \"affairs\" may be ill-advised, an abuse of trust and gross professional misconduct on the part of the teachers, but that's all they usually are. Besides, what else do most people of 16 to 18 think about except sex, sex, sex and relationships? It's the peak age for volcanic crushes, jealousies, falling-outs and discoveries. The classroom is a hotbed of swirling heaven-knows-what, where no one really knows what they're doing or what they want. And A-level girls are very attractive. Perhaps they think their male classmates are immature. Then along comes a young teacher, just out of university, who doesn't know where to draw the line, or doesn't care, or falls in love, or takes advantage of the situation. Or an older teacher, who ought to know better, thinks he has fallen in love, as our former chief inspector of schools Chris Woodhead did decades ago. Only after the girl had left, mind you. He swears it. The relationship continued for nine years. He may have been a grisly inspector and husband, but he wasn't a criminal.</p> <p>My teacher friend was once obliged to take a 20-year-old, fabulously attractive student teacher into his A-level English classes. All the boys were in turmoil, all the male teachers queueing up in the staff room to make her coffee. What are we supposed to do about that? </p> <p><strong>How wonderful that Mr Brown and Mr Mandelson appear</strong> to have made up again after 14 years of hatred. Imagine all those years of poisonous bile, titanic loathing, tantrumming, sniping and squabbling, and now they're chums again, fighting for the same cause. I do admire them. Because it's not an easy thing to do, to stop hating someone.</p> <p>I tend to go on and on doing it. So does Rosemary, so did my mother, and it's a bad thing to do. \"You must let go of your hatred,\" a friend once advised me. \"It's corrosive.\" She's probably right, but I like to hang on to it, like a comforter. Sometimes I even lull myself to sleep thinking hateful, bitter thoughts of ex-friends and partners. \"The bastard/cow,\" I think. \"How could he/she have done that? What a cheek. Why did I put up with it? What a wet.\" And then, soothed by the familiar groove of hatred and self-loathing, I am soon fast asleep.</p> <p>Then last week I heard that someone I don't like, because years ago she suddenly didn't like me and wouldn't say why, now seems to want to be friends again, because she's forgotten how horrid she was. But I, of course, haven't forgotten. And never will. Sometimes I forget these things for a while, and then a little reminder pops up: a place, a bit of music, a topic in these columns, which reminds me of these figures from my past, so I dredge up their misdeeds and mull over them, or write or blab about them, which I think is better than silently festering. Not everyone approves of my method.</p> <p>\"Will you please stop writing about Him,\" says American Cousin. \"People will think you still care.\" But I don't really care. I just like a bit of bitterness-speak - a sort of emotional enema that lets all the nastiness out, and probably saves me from stomach ulcers. </p> <p>\"It's not just mild bitterness,\" observes Fielding. \"You sound like the sort of person who sticks pins into dolls. You've got to try forgiveness.\" Which is easy for him to say. He does do hatred sometimes, but tends to forget about it for long periods, because it's too tiring to keep it going. \"I haven't got the energy,\" he says. \"It's not a moral decision. I just can't be bothered. But when I get drunk, it all comes back and turns into murderous hate.\" Then, tottering home from the public house, he often passes a high crane at the end of his street and longs for his ex-line manager and all the other swine who have made his life a misery to be dangling from it, hopefully in a gibbet. For ever.</p> <p>We must just hope and pray that Brown and Mandelson never turn to drink.</p> <p><strong>This week Michele saw</strong> Drawing Breath Recycled, at Whitstable Horsebridge Gallery: \"An exhibition about breathing, curated by Jean Fraser - a mixture of montages, maps, x-ray lightboxes, sound installations and a driftwood bicycle.\" <strong>She also saw</strong> Chosen on More 4: \"Three brave men describe their sexual abuse at a school.

  "<p>Alan Ayckbourn's trilogy gets its first London revival in 34 years in a radically reconfigured Old Vic with its own built-in \"theatre in the round.\" But, although Matthew Warchus's production is often explosively funny, I was reminded this time of the trilogy's Chekhovian undertow. However much we laugh, the plays actually deal with loneliness, frustration, familial tensions and thwarted lust.</p> <p>The action covers a traumatic family weekend in rural Sussex. Each play views events from a different vantage-point: dining-room, living-room and garden. And behind the technical ingenuity lies a portrait of emotional chaos in which the pivotal figure is a libertine librarian, Norman. Married to the myopic, work-obsessed Ruth, Norman's chief objective is to whisk his sister-in-law, Annie, off for a dirty weekend in East Grinstead. When that fails, he turns his attention to his other sister-in-law, Sarah. To make matters more complex, the solitary Annie is half in love with a dismally ineffectual vet named Tom.</p> <p>Ayckbourn's talent for conjuring laughter out of pain is seen at its best in Table Manners. There are few scenes in modern comedy to rival a fractious family dinner in which tempers are violently lost while the hapless Tom sits on a low-slung chair with his head protruding over the table. But a later scene in which Jessica Hynes' superbly unhappy Annie smashes dining-room plates as Ben Miles's dithering Tom fails yet again to articulate his feelings for her is sad enough to evoke Lopakhin's final encounter with Varya in The Cherry Orchard. And the same contradictory emotions are apparent in Living Together.</p> <p>Even if the temperature drops slightly in Round and Round The Garden, we are privy to an astonishing incremental display of familial solitude. And the catalyst is the lecherous Norman, well played by Stephen Mangan as a shaggy Lawrentian satyr. But he in no way dominates a superb cast. Amanda Root beautifully suggests that Sarah's control-freakery is the product of deep sexual frustration while Paul Ritter as the safari-suited Reg shows a man trapped inside his adolescent, hobby-filled dreams. And Amelia Bullmore's Ruth vividly emerges as a victim of the work-ethic.</p>",
  "<p>Citigroup and Wells Fargo tonight agreed to a temporary ceasefire in a battle for control of the struggling US bank Wachovia after intensive efforts by federal regulators to forge a three-way agreement.</p> <p>The two rival bidders said they would halt litigation until noon on Wednesday over their respective takeover bids for Wachovia, which has been brought to its knees by billions of dollars in mortgage-related liabilities.</p> <p>With the backing of a government guarantee, Citigroup last week believed it had sealed a $2.2bn offer for much of Wachovia until Friday, when Wells Fargo swooped in with a $15bn agreed bid for the entire company.</p> <p>Furious at being gazumped, Citigroup sought an order from the supreme court of New York state over the weekend to block Wells Fargo's offer. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is keen to find a compromise to avert the prospect of a long, damaging battle for Wachovia that could undermine the North Carolina-based group's already tenuous condition.<br>One suggestion on the table is to divide Wachovia's network of 3,300 branches with Wells Fargo taking those in California and the southeast and Citigroup getting outlets in the northeast.</p> <p>Court papers provide a glimpse into the true extent of Wachovia's problems. In a legal filing, Wachovia disclosed that when it agreed a deal in principle with Citigroup a week ago, it was within hours of being shut down by banking regulators.</p> <p>Wachovia said it spoke to Citigroup \"with the understanding that a seizure of its banking assets later that day by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would occur\" unless it secured a takeover.</p> <p>A familiar name on US high streets, Wachovia was America's fourth largest commercial bank by assets before the present industry shake-out began. It holds $447bn of deposits, serves 15m customers and employs 120,000 people. It has run into trouble because of its vast book of risky mortgages known as \"option ARMs\" which were popular with cash-strapped borrowers because they permitted very low repayments.</p> <p>Citigroup maintains that by striking an eleventh hour deal with Wells Fargo, executives at Wachovia acted in bad faith and breached an agreement for exclusivity in negotiations. Sources close to the saga say Citigroup has made it clear it will raise its offer to a level similar to Wells Fargo's, although it still wants the government to stand behind some of Wachovia's riskier assets.</p> <p>A prominent Wall Street hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, revealed he had been buying Wachovia stock heavily. Ackman, who rose to prominence by betting on Lehman Brothers' collapse, said he saw Wachovia as \"one of the more fascinating investment opportunities\" on the market.</p> <p>Paul Miller, an analyst at stockbroker Friedman Billings Ramsay, said he believed Wells Fargo would ultimately secure Wachovia to create a \"national banking powerhouse\". \"Citigroup is attempting to enforce its exclusivity agreement for Wachovia or increase its offer, but we expect that Wells Fargo should eventually prevail,\" he said in a note to clients. So far this year, 13 high-street banks have failed in the US including last month's collapse of Seattle-based Washington Mutual - the biggest retail banking collapse on record. As in Europe, regulators are keen to stem any erosion of public confidence in banks.</p> <p>In an unexpected twist, lawyers have suggested that an obscure clause in the US government's $700bn banking bail-out package could invalidate Citigroup's claim of exclusivity. The clause liberalises takeover talks between banks in a measure intended to lessen the likelihood of failures.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bank of America has struck an $8.4bn deal with law enforcement authorities to settle a slew of investigations over the conduct of Countrywide Financial, its newly acquired mortgage lender. </p> <p>Bank of America will modify mortgages for 400,000 people by reducing interest rates or cutting principal loan amounts. This will avert the prospect of prosecution by attorney generals in several US states who have alleged that Countrywide systematically mis-sold homeloans.</p>",
  "<p>The US financial markets were on the brink of a record-breaking slump today as Wall Street reacted to signs that the credit crunch is spiralling out of control to threaten the stability of economies around the globe.</p> <p>As European governments struggled to contain banking failures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 800 points at one stage, exceeding last week's largest ever one-day points drop of 777.</p> <p>The blue-chip index staged a modest rally during the final hour of trading in New York to close with a fall of 369 points to 9,955. But it was the first time the Dow had fallen below 10,000 since October 2004, with banks and struggling car companies leading the rout.</p> <p>Analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley warned that problems originating in the US financial system were ricocheting around the world: \"The recession now threatens to go global, with industrial economies on the brink, and trade and financial shocks threatening the developing world.\"</p> <p>As stocks plunged, the US treasury wasted little time in getting its contentious $700bn bail-out of the banking industry under way. </p> <p>The treasury tonight named a high-ranking official, Neel Kashkari, to head a new office of financial stability and began soliciting for asset managers to help manage the purchase of banks' distressed securities. </p> <p>In six business days, the Dow has slumped by nearly 11% and prices are 30% below their peak, reached in October 2007. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve tried to shore up financial stability today by doubling the amount of money available for short-term lending to banks from $300bn to $600bn.</p> <p>\"You're seeing a tremendous amount of nervousness,\" said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx in New York. \"People are seeing this crisis go beyond the US \u2013 they're realising it's a global crisis.\"</p> <p>Investors' concerns about the international financial system were exacerbated by problems afflicting the German mortgage firm Hypo Real Estate. In the US, two major state governments \u2013 California and Massachusetts \u2013 say they may need loans from the federal government to tide them over.</p> <p>Tobias Levkovich, chief US market strategist at Citigroup, said there was a volatile market mood as \"the credit crisis has deepened and the economic news out of Europe continues to be almost universally bad\". But he expressed optimism that stocks were approaching a bottom, pointing to trends in previous recessions, to the ratio of funds' cash holdings and to a \"sense of resignation within investor sentiment\".</p> <p>On Wall Street, banks suffered a severe sell-off and there was bad news after the market closed as Bank of America revealed a 68% drop in profits to $1.18bn. The firm said it was embarking on a $10bn fundraising and it halved its dividend payout to shareholders.</p> <p>\"These are the most difficult times for financial institutions that I have experienced in my 39 years in banking,\" said Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis.</p> <p>Struggling car manufacturers were dealt a blow by a warning from Volkswagen which admitted it would miss its target of selling 100,000 vehicles in the US this year. Ford dropped by almost 9% and General Motors by 6%.</p> <p>\"We all had anticipated some degree of economic adversity,\" Volkswagen's US chief Johan de Nysschen told Bloomberg News. \"We didn't imagine the largest one-day drop in the history of mankind.\"</p> <p>On a visit to Texas, President George Bush met a group of small business leaders at a soda shop in San Antonio to discuss their personal experiences of the credit crunch. Speaking outside, he warned that the government's bail-out plan would take some time to work even after Friday's approval by Congress, ending a political battle over the policy.</p> <p>\"It's going to take a while to get in place a programme that, one, is effective and, two, doesn't waste taxpayers' money,\" said Bush. \"We don't want to rush into the situation and have the program not be effective.\"</p> <p>Wall Street's tumble was part of an international epidemic. </p> <p>Trading was halted at stockmarkets in Russia, Brazil and Peru.<br>\"The issues are worldwide,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. \"People are scared and the only thing they're doing is selling.\"</p>",
  "<p>With just four weeks until the presidential election, John McCain's campaign is becoming increasingly desperate. It seems they now feel that without the use of swiftboating tactics, McCain doesn't have a hope in hell of getting into the Oval Office.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Sarah Palin addressed Republicans in California, Texas and Nebraska. Coming just a few days after Congress passed an unprecedented $700bn bail-out plan for Wall Street, you'd think that the economy would be at the forefront of Palin's mind and that she'd be concerned with reassuring American taxpayers that they will never again have to bear the burden for corporate greed. But no!</p> <p>Instead, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/03/AR2008100303738.html\">Republicans decided to change the subject</a> to Obama's extremely <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/02/obamas_weatherman_connection.html\">tenuous</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8630.html\">association with the controversial 1960s left-wing activist Bill Ayers</a>. \"Our opponent though is someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country,\" <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081004/ap_on_el_pr/palin_obama\">Palin said at a fundraiser in Denver </a>on Saturday. She <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/palin-obama-is-palling-around-with-terrorists/\">repeated the claim at a rally in California</a> on Sunday. \"Turns out one of his earliest supporters is a man, who according to the New York Times, was a domestic terrorist,\" she said.</p> <p>By choosing to focus on irrelevant topics such as Obama's alleged friendship with Ayers \u2013 which Obama has repudiated \u2013 the Republicans are showing America that their campaign is so vacuous and unsubstantial when it comes to matters of substance that this is all they are able to draw attention to. The truth is that if McCain and Palin genuinely had anything different to offer from what George Bush has been giving America for the past eight years, particularly in this economically unstable time, they would tell everyone about it in no uncertain terms. But they aren't talking about the things that matter because they don't have anything to say. </p> <p>It seems that character assassination is the area of expertise in which they hope to be able to win the presidency. While some of the more hardcore Republican voters may be reassured by this, it will probably do little to comfort anyone else that McCain and Palin have what it takes to deal effectively with the range of serious issues that they would inherit should McCain become president. </p> <p>According to McCain's advisers, this is <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/10/barack_obama_john_mccain_campa.html\">part of a new strategy</a> aimed at \"looking to turning the page on this financial crisis and getting back to discussing Mr Obama's liberal, aggressively liberal, record and how he will be too risky for the Americans\". Notwithstanding the fact that the Republicans believe that lies about Obama's friendships are more important than the reality of the current economic crisis, there is nothing new about Obama-targeted character smears. </p> <p>Falsehoods about Obama being an un-American, unpatriotic Muslim have been bandied about throughout this campaign. Nevertheless, he has managed to get past all of those charges virtually unscathed, remaining, more or less, consistently ahead of McCain in the polls since he became the Democratic nominee. It's therefore rather pathetic that the Republicans feel the need to regurgitate these accusations when it has already been shown that they don't really work. It is simply, as Obama also said this weekend, \"what you do when you're out of touch, out of ideas and running out of time.\"</p> <p>Using the vice-presidential candidate to play bad cop is a common tactic. With a month to go before the election, it was also to be expected that the Republicans would start to play dirty. With Palin's sharply falling popularity, however, it is possible \u2013 and probable - that her comments could <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1847376,00.html\">seriously backfire</a>. Already it is being suggested that her accusations <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hLxEMDD-UlNa6HUrozE6ZkGYPTqAD93KDRUO0\">carry a racial undertone</a>, while Republican commentators such as strategist Mike Murphy have also said that focusing on Obama's character is, at this time, a risky strategy for the Republicans. Speaking on MSNBC's Meet the Press programme on Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27034205/page/2/\">Murphy wisely said</a>: \"I think [focusing on the liberal nature of the Democrats] is a better prosecution for the McCain campaign than these character attacks or these dubious association, you know, background issues and Obama. \u2026 I don't think that's the key when everybody in the country, at least the swing voters that are going to control the election, are very much worried about the economy.\"</p> <p>The Republicans hope that focusing on Obama's association with Ayers (and no doubt the other characters that they will bring to the fore over the next few weeks) will raise questions about his judgement, seemingly forgetting that Palin herself is, among other things, a living display of McCain's own questionable judgement. She's not \u2013 as they have tried to suggest Ayres is to Obama - just an acquaintance, but his pick to be vice-president of the US, a matter with much more serious ramifications for the American people. </p> <p>Furthermore, with the findings of Palin's involvement in the Troopergate scandal due to be released soon, the Republicans may do well to remember the saying that people in glass houses should not throw stones.</p>",
  "<p>Seven years after Sol Campbell left Tottenham FC, fanatical Spurs fans can't forgive the man they call \"Judas\". They are still seething with anger and hatred, following his transfer to rival team Arsenal and then to Portsmouth. For years, they have subjected Campbell to a torrent of vile homophobic abuse that goes way beyond legitimate ribbing and mockery. </p> <p>These chants include: </p> <p><em>\"He's big, he's black. He takes it up his crack. Sol Campbell, Sol Campbell.\"</em></p> <p>And even worse: </p> <p><em> \"Sol, Sol, wherever you may be / You're on the verge of lunacy / And we don't give a f**k if you're hanging from a tree / You Judas c**t with HIV.\" </em></p> <p>\"Hanging from a tree\" could be a reference to a racist lynching, or more likely, to Judas's guilt-ridden suicide after betraying Jesus. Or, perhaps, to the death of footballer <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/87288.stm\">Justin Fashanu</a> who hanged himself in 1998, after years of anti-gay taunts.</p> <p>For years, Tottenham and the Football Association (FA) did nothing. They allowed Campbell to be abused. They let fans get away with their homophobia. </p> <p>The FA would not have sat on the fence if the abuse had been of a racist nature. Thanks to the pioneering Kick It Out anti-racist campaign, which <strong>is</strong> backed by the FA, individual clubs and the FA take a much tougher stance against racial abuse. Why the double standards? </p> <p>Seven years of homophobic hatred against Campbell came to a head on Sunday September 28 at Fratton Park, when Tottenham played Portsmouth. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Spurs fans joined in the anti-gay chants. But this time, they weren't ignored as usual. There was widespread revulsion, and not just from Campbell, his manager Harry Redknapp and the Portsmouth supporters. </p> <p>The police announced an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/01/premierleague.portsmouth\">investigation</a> into \"public order offences\" and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/30/premierleague.portsmouth\">urged the FA</a> to take action. </p> <p>Portsmouth have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/03/portsmouth.tottenhamhotspur\">complained</a> to the FA about the behaviour of the Spurs fans. </p> <p>The FA director of communications Adrian Bevington responded by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/7651057.stm\">telling</a> BBC Radio 5 Live: </p> <blockquote> <p>This is disgusting, vile abuse - whether it is homophobic or racist, any abuse of that nature is simply not acceptable. We have to have a zero tolerance approach to it. </p> <p>The FA, the clubs and the police are working together to identify the individuals. There were hundreds of people shouting that abuse at Fratton Park last week and it is very difficult to walk in and try to eject people in that situation. </p> <p>What we have to do now is make sure those individuals are identified using CCTV or any other means. </p> <p>They need to be identified, publicly arrested - so there is an example made - and banned for life from attending football matches.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have written to the FA urging \"prompt disciplinary action\" to deter any repeat of the abuse at future matches.</p> <p>This could include fining Spurs for failing to control its fans and banning some or all Tottenham fans from attending their team's next match. Given the large number of fans who homophobically abused Campbell, and the difficulty in identifying them, a one-match ban on all Spurs fans might be justified. Although I don't want to penalise the innocent, it could usefully prompt a bit of peer pressure on the terraces to call time on anti-gay abuse. Empty stands would also send a clear, strong message. </p> <p>But punishing offenders is not the ideal or only action required. Persuading them to ditch their bigotry is a better long-term solution. </p> <p>The FA should organise the mass distribution of anti-homophobia leaflets to Spurs fans at the club's next few matches, and make a PA announcement at the start of the next Spurs kick-off, warning that homophobic, racist and antisemitic insults of any kind are unacceptable and that offending clubs and fans will be penalised. The FA could insist that there are similar anti-homophobia messages on tickets, in match programmes and on the giant screens inside stadiums. </p> <p>There needs be a high-level meeting between the FA and the Spurs management, with Tottenham being required to draw up a plan of action to educate their fans in tolerance.</p> <p>All clubs should agree to introduce a five-year ban on players and fans who indulge in racist and homophobic insults. </p> <p>The <a href=\"www.gfsn.org.uk\">Gay Football Supporters Network</a> is also pressing Spurs and the FA for tough action: </p> <blockquote> <p>There has been no widespread publicity from Tottenham to its fans over the changed ground regulations prohibiting homophobic chants, and no word from the club on how breaches of the regulations would be dealt with,\" said GFSN. </p> <p>The FA and GFSN have worked together to encourage greater dialogue with the professional clubs in instigating the ground regulations outlawing homophobic abuse by having volunteer liaison officers to discuss such issues with the clubs. Unlike teams such as Reading FC and Bradford City FC, we were disappointed that Tottenham FC failed to respond to the liaison officer's call for a meeting where the abuse of Mr Campbell could have been discussed and steps taken to prevent it in future. </p> <p>Homophobic abuse of footballers is completely unacceptable and is one of the main reasons why there are no out gay professional footballers. Who can blame them, since openly gay players are likely to be subjected to similar homophobia. </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The Icelandic government tonight presented an emergency bill giving it sweeping powers over the nation's banks as it battled to save the country from financial ruin.</p> <p>In an address broadcast on Icelandic television, prime minister Geir Haarde said the bill, supported by opposition parties, would allow the government to push through mergers between the battered Icelandic banks or force them to declare bankruptcy.</p> <p>Haarde, who had spent the weekend in intensive talks, made it clear how urgent the need for action now was. \"As recently as last night, it looked like the banks could continue operations for a while,\" he said. \"This morning and today, things have totally changed for the worse.\" Time appeared to be running out for Iceland to deliver a solution to the financial crisis today as its currency, the krona, slumped 30% against the euro.</p> <p>The emergency bill, which parliament was due to adopt last night, would also allow the government to take over housing loans held by the banks and put them in a government housing fund. </p> <p>The financial regulator had earlier suspended shares in Iceland's main banks to prevent panic selling. The government also followed the likes of Ireland and Germany by guaranteeing all of the domestic deposits in Icelandic savings accounts, although UK savers in the popular Icesave and Kaupthing Edge accounts run by the Icelandic banks will not be covered. </p> <p>Concerns about the Icelandic economy grew stronger last week after the government seized control of the third largest bank Glitnir, taking a 75% stake in return for \u20ac600m - Haarde warning Icelanders at the time of \"the inevitable cut in living standards\" to come.</p> <p>The falling currency, which closed at a record low of 230 Icelandic krona to the euro, is worsening the crisis for the banks, which are shouldering large overseas debts, and for many thousands of individuals in Iceland who were encouraged to take out car loans and mortgages in foreign currencies in recent years. </p> <p>In Iceland, there was widespread fear. Sigridur D\u00f6gg Audunsdottir, a local government worker in Reykjavik said everyone in the country was \"holding their breath\". She today withdrew her cash from the bank, all the way to her overdraft limit, to make sure her family had enough to live on. </p> <p>\"It is just unimaginable. It is so dark and gloomy, we have never experienced anything like this. I took out my money just to be safe, because I felt I had to do something. We've all been living ahead of ourselves, so in many ways this was inevitable. People here have been so obssessed with money. Iceland is like a nouveau riche country. </p> <p>\"I am not blaming the people. The problem seems to be oversized banks in a small economy. We trusted the banks and they encouraged us to borrow money.\"</p> <p>A collapse in Iceland would severely dent confidence in the broader financial markets. But it also has the potential for direct impact in Britain, with the main banks funding a string of companies and high rolling entrepreneurs including Robert Tchenguiz, a large investor in Sainsbury's, chef Gordon Ramsay, the property tycoon Candy brothers and the chairman of West Ham Football Club, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson.</p> <p>One of Iceland's biggest companies, Baugur, has stakes in a swathe of the British high street, including House of Fraser, Karen Millen, Oasis and Whittard of Chelsea. One of the biggest credit insurance firms has stopped covering suppliers to Baugur controlled stores and the company has been furiously fighting rumours that it could be in trouble. In a statement over the weekend, it reiterated that most of the funding of its businesses comes from international banks and that it has little exposure to the disaster struck Icelandic economy.</p> <p>Haarde is said to have approached other Nordic governments to see if their central banks might be prepared to inject liquidity into the Icelandic system. Haarde said the the banks had agreed at the weekend to sell some overseas assets and bring the cash back to Iceland. The nation's pension funds, which have assets of \u20ac12bn, are also being encouraged to repatriate cash.</p> <p>The two biggest banks, Kaupthing and Landsbanki, which runs Icesave, have thousands of UK savers' deposits, attracted by their competitive rates. The Kaupthing Edge account is covered by the UK government guarantee on deposits up to \u00a350,000, while in the case of Icesave, the first \u20ac22,000 (roughly \u00a317,000) is covered by the Icelandic compensation scheme and the remainder up to the \u00a350,000 limit by Britain. A spokeswoman for Kaupthing said there had been no rush to close accounts.</p> <p>Richard Portes, an expert on Iceland at the London Business School, said the government had made a mistake by nationalising Glitnir and creating fear in the markets, instead of just providing it with liquidity. \"You have the same law of unintended consequences that you had in the case of Lehman Brothers,\" he said. \"The Iceland problem was immediately vastly exaggerated.\" He said the Icelandic banks had been unfairly targeted. \"The world is a little unjust. They don't hold any toxic papers. The assets they will have to sell are prefectly good assets. They have been prudently managed and haven't been exessively dependent on the wholesale money markets compared to anyone else.\"</p> <p>Iceland has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past couple of decades, from an economy largely based on fishing to one of the richest in Europe, driven by its biggest three banks following deregulation of the banking system. The banks grew rapidly on borrowing and now have assets eight times Iceland's GDP. But the party has come to an end, with the krona losing more than half its value against the euro in the past 12 months, inflation running at 12%, and interest rates at 15.5%.</p>",
  "<p>I have been trying for the past week to make sense of the stunning faux-populism exhibited by a majority of US congressional representatives when faced with the very real possibility of a global financial meltdown.</p> <p>That the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/la-na-econpoll24-2008sep24,0,5568395.story\">majority of Americans</a> opposed a package defined up front as a bail-out for the elites rather than a shoring-up operation for the entire economy is <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/106114/Six-Oppose-Wall-Street-Bailouts.aspx\">not in doubt</a>. At least until the calamitous stock market response to the House of Representatives voting down the bail-out plan last Monday, most Americans clearly thought a credit crisis was something that only affected wealthy people and the bail-out something that would solely benefit millionaires at the expense of the rest of us.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2008/oct/03/useconomy.marketturmoil\">Chastened by the market slide</a>, the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jdH_jFDkWlSEeZocD5AIpAwxEfBA\">Senate passed a revised version</a> of the bail-out plan on Wednesday, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy2\">the House approved it on Friday</a>. But that a majority of representatives originally felt the public was not only against the bill but so passionately against it that they would vote out of office its supporters is more interesting.</p> <p>Why the rage? I think it goes way beyond schadenfreude, not wanting to help out fat cats who had a fall coming to them, way beyond even the sheer $700bn sticker-price shock of the bail-out request. It hints, instead, at a growing, if still inchoate, realisation that the social contract has broken down.</p> <p>In response to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sasha-abramsky/waiting-for-the-deluge_b_130416.html\">a piece I wrote last week</a> for the Huffington Post on the collapse of the congressional vote, one blogger wrote that things were already so bad that he or she had nothing left to lose. \"Burn, baby, burn,\" the respondent urged. In other words, yes, the credit crunch might pull a whole lot of economic edifices down on top of us, but we're so poor anyway who cares?</p> <p>Sure, it's nihilistic. And nihilism is something that, supposedly, has no place beside the anything's possible tenets of the American dream. But it's not an entirely unreasonable position. About 10% of white adults and 25% of black and Latino adults don't have bank accounts, and the number is growing as more people slide into poverty - which means their credit system consists of exploitative check-cashing centres and payday loans with sky-high interest rates. The minimum wage might keep people from literally starving, but it doesn't pay enough to allow them to live in decent homes, eat three square meals a day and purchase needed medicines.</p> <p>And yet the economy has been restructured so that more and more jobs are at, or not too far above, the minimum wage. McDonalds, Wal-Mart - the new titans are the companies that pay pitiable wages and skimp on benefits. Their employees work long hours just to stay in place, to avoid that slide from near-poverty into real poverty. About one in three American workers earns less than $10 per hour, the amount calculated by many economists as representing a baseline <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/07/aquestionoffairness\">\"living wage\"</a> given the current cost of living.</p> <p>In recent years, guaranteed pensions have been lost to millions of workers, as companies in industries like airlines and aluminium production declare bankruptcy. Men and women in their 50s who have worked for the same company for years suddenly find themselves with no pensions or health benefits. Supermarkets in many states have introduced two-tier pay rates, pushing down wages and benefits for incoming employees. And workers have had to pony up cash for an ever-higher proportion of their health insurance premiums.</p> <p>These trends have been growing for a generation now. The last few years, in which gas and food prices have soared and the housing market has imploded, are, for many impoverished Americans, simply the icing on this cake.</p> <p>In the past several months, the credit crunch has reduced the life prospects of huge numbers of people. One example: people seeking student loans from private lenders (top-up loans beyond those provided by the government) have seen their interest rates about double, which means it's becoming ever-harder for poor people to go to college just at a time when higher education is becoming ever-more vital as a stepping stone out of poverty.</p> <p>Moreover, an increasing number of businesses are being forced to close, either because consumers aren't buying or banks aren't lending. If anyone doubted the human cost of a collapsing pyramid-scheme economy, consider the latest unemployment numbers: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/business/economy/04jobs.html?hp\">over 150,000 jobs lost in one month alone</a>. It doesn't take a whole lot of months like that before we're in a severe, and long-lasting recession.</p> <p>Given all of this, it's no surprise that congressional delegations have been inundated with calls and emails expressing outrage at the Wall Street bail-out. \"Where were you, the federal government,\" these people are saying, \"when we needed help paying our bills and staying in our homes?\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, in this case, the political reaction against moves intended to free up credit is worsening an already debilitating situation. It is, in a sense, akin to cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</p> <p>I don't blame the populace as a whole for this. After all, why should a low-wage employee living in a small home which they are at imminent risk of losing to foreclosure have an in-depth grasp of economics? That's the job of their political leaders. And this past week, as in the years of greed-politics that preceded it and that gutted the economic wellbeing of millions of Americans, those leaders have failed.</p>",
  "<p>The FTSE 100 index suffered its biggest ever one-day points fall today while Wall Street dipped below 10,000 points for the first time in four years, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">fears over the stability of the global banking sector</a> sent markets sliding worldwide.</p> <p>The contagion in the US financial market has had central bankers and politicians across Europe running to reassure savers that their deposits will be protected. </p> <p>At the close in London, the FTSE 100 was down 391.1 points at 4589.2, its worst ever closing performance in points terms as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">traders looked for chancellor Alistair Darling to shore up of the UK's banking sector</a>. Shares across the banking sector dropped on fears that any deal would involve the government taking stakes in high street firms.</p> <p>But the wider market was pushed lower when Darling's speech to the House of Commons failed to meet the expectations in the City that were fuelled by weekend reports of a so-called recapitalisation plan, which would have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">taxpayers' money pumped into high street banks</a>.</p> <p>In the early evening, Darling was believed to be in conversation with several senior banking figures but some in the Square Mile had hoped he would unveil a rescue plan today.</p> <p>However, in his speech to MPs following the first meeting of his economic war cabinet, he merely reiterated his promise to do \"whatever is needed\" to maintain financial stability.</p> <p>\"It would be irresponsible to speculate on the specifics of future responses,\" he added. \"Providing a running commentary could add to uncertainty in already febrile market conditions. .. But all practical options must remain open to us.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England, he said, will pump a further \u00a340bn into the financial system on Tuesday to try to unstick the global financial markets.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, he added, will also look at whether the savings guarantee of \u00a350,000 - which comes into force on Tuesday - should be increased still further. Several European governments have already moved to guarantee all savings, something which has annoyed the Treasury which had hoped Europe might be able to put on a united front.</p> <p>Following the lead set by Ireland and then Greece, the German, Danish and Austrian governments have all moved to guarantee all savings. The Swedish authorities, meanwhile, doubled their savings guarantee to 500,000 Swedish kroner (\u00a340,000), and Spain warned that it might also announce a protection scheme unless there was coordinated action across Europe.</p> <p>The German finance ministry, however, added that it was not planning any state guarantee for the financial sector itself. Such a move had been mooted after Hypo Real Estate, the country's second-largest property lender, received a \u20ac50bn (\u00a339bn) rescue package after an earlier bail-out failed to ease fears over its future.</p> <p>\"It is the case, as far as I'm aware, no government or the European commission was aware of what the Irish government was proposing to do last week,\" Darling said.</p> <p>\"It does demonstrate the problems that arise when member states take unilateral action because of course it does have a knock-on effect with other member states. The same with Germany - Germany took action yesterday, where as I understand it they made a declaration that's not legally binding, it's a political declaration in relation to guarantees. It does emphasise the need for us all to work together.\"</p> <p>In percentage terms the drop in the FTSE 100 index on Monday is 7.85% or the third worst percentage closing loss in history.</p> <p>The poor performance is beaten only by the crash of 1987 when the index of leading shares lost 10% and 12% in two consecutive days - or roughly 250 points a day.</p> <p>In cash terms, the drop has wiped \u00a393bn off the value of London's top 100 companies.</p> <p>By the time the FTSE 100 closed, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 400 points, dipping under the 10,000 level for the first time in four years, and by 1.30pm EDT the Dow had slid even further, losing 530 points to 9793.</p> <p>The share slump saw many investors flock to so-called \"safe havens\" such as gold. In New York, gold futures have risen 5% today on fears that the $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bail-out plan will not be adequate to deal with the growing crisis.</p> <p><strong>New York blues</strong></p> <p>Having watched stockmarkets in Europe and Asia plummet on banking failures, traders in New York began selling heavily from the moment the opening bell rang, with struggling banks and car manufacturers leading the cascade downwards.</p> <p>The Bush administration's $700bn banking bail-out package, signed into law by the president on Friday, had little effect on improving morale. Uncertainty persists as to how quickly the emergency rescue plan can be implemented and critics continue to wonder whether it will be enough to support the stricken financial services industry.</p> <p>\"You're seeing a tremendous amount of nervousness,\" said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx in New York. \"People are seeing this crisis go beyond the US - they're realising it's a global crisis.\"</p> <p>In six business days, the Dow has slumped by 11% - a fall kicked off by last Monday's record dive of 777 points. The Federal Reserve tried to shore up financial stability on Monday by doubling the amount of money available for short-term lending to banks from $300bn to $600bn.</p> <p>The crisis shows no signs of abating in the US and is spreading beyond Wall Street. Two major state governments - California and Massachusetts - have now warned they may need loans from the federal government to tide them over.</p> <p>Tobias Levkovich, chief US market strategist at Citigroup, described a volatile market mood as \"the credit crisis has deepened and the economic news out of Europe continues to be almost universally bad\". But he expressed optimism that stocks were approaching a bottom, pointing to trends in previous recessions, to the ratio of funds' cash holdings and to a \"sense of resignation within investor sentiment\".</p> <p>Banks have suffered a particularly severe sell-off in New York with Goldman Sachs down 7%, Citigroup 9% lower and JP Morgan falling 5%. Heavy industrial companies have sank alongside them, with General Electric down by 4%.</p> <p>Companies across the world are reporting the impact of the crisis on their individual industries. In German SAP admitted that the crisis caused a sudden halt to sales of its software in the last few weeks of September as corporate customers stopped spending due to the crunch.</p> <p>Volkswagen, meanwhile, admitted it would miss its target of selling 100,000 vehicles in the US this year as consumers hold off spending. In the UK, new car sales slumped last month, according to industry figures released on Monday.</p> <p>On a visit to Texas, President Bush met a group of small business leaders at a soda shop in San Antonio to discuss their personal experiences of the credit crunch. Speaking outside, he warned that the government's bail-out plan would take some time to work even after Friday's approval by Congress, ending a political battle over the policy.</p> <p>\"It's going to take a while to get in place a programme that, one, is effective and, two, doesn't waste taxpayers' money,\" he said. \"We don't want to rush into the situation and have the programme not be effective.\"</p> <p>Stockmarkets across the world saw one of their most turbulent day's trading on Monday.</p> <p>The Russian stockmarket had to halt trading on three separate occasions because of the intensity of the share selling with its main index losing over 18%. Shares on the Canadian Stock Exchange have recorded their biggest ever intra-day loss while in Brazil the country's leading index of shares saw trading stopped twice after falls of over 15%. </p> <p>Oil, meanwhile, dropped below $90 a barrel on fears that a global economic slowdown will reduce demand.</p>",
  "<p>\"Hell no!\" said the man with the long beard from his half opened doorway.</p> <p>Meghan Schertz's Obama badge had unleashed a torrent of invective.</p> <p>\"No Obama,\" he kept shouting, while Meghan struggled to finish a sentence. \"I don't need to hear nothing from you Obama people.\"</p> <p>\"Do you see the fucking Nader sign,\" he bellowed, pointing to his yard sign which bared the name of the perennial independent candidate, Ralph Nader. \"There's your answer.\"</p> <p>\"So you're an independent then,\" asked Meghan, as though engaged in rational conversation.</p> <p>\"Get you're ass off my property before I get my shot gun,\" said the tourretic Nader supporter. And so we left. As we circled back along the street the man sat at a table in his driveway. </p> <p>Cheekily, I waved my hand at him. Menacingly, he waved his gun at me.</p> <p>An afternoon out with an Obama canvasser is an education in the leg work, patience and resilience it takes for the Democratic presidential contender's strategy work. </p> <p>It took about an hour and half to visit a designated number of houses in just a few streets in the Washington Heights area of Roanoke - a racially mixed middle-class part of town. </p> <p>In a bid to identify Obama's base so they can make sure they maximise their turnout on polling day, she asks them who they are going to support, how strong their support is, whether they are sure to turn up on election day and if they would like some literature. </p> <p>Or at least she tries to. One man took one look at Meghan and, before she could open her mouth, said: \"I don't want to talk about it,\" and then went back inside. </p> <p>Another woman refused to open the door but shouted from her window.</p> <p>\"I'm for Obama, so go on now.\"</p> <p>After many weekends' campaigning Schertz anticipates the response she's going to get as she walks up the driveway from the kind of cars people drive and other signifiers - a mixture of prejudice and defence mechanism. </p> <p>But it doesn't always work. The home with two pick-up trucks bearing Harley Davidson stickers are leaning Obama. And who knew that a Nader sign would produce a gun-toting misanthrope.</p> <p>But there are moments that have the smack of meaningful if minor achievement. With a day to go before the registration deadline Schertz also carries registration forms just in case. She gives some advice to a woman who is worried that her son's registration has his middle name wrong - the kind of discrepancy that could play havoc on election day. </p> <p>In Virginia where if you don't vote for more than four years you fall off the voter rolls, some are not sure if they are registered or not. </p> <p>And then there's the information that goes back to town office about where the base is, that will be punched into the computer providing the raw data on which the campaign's logistical efforts hinge. It all happens on such a small scale that you couldn't do it unless you thought you were part of something bigger. </p> <p>Schertz, whose run-in with the Nader voter ultimately only provided more raw material for her good humour, has never been involved in an election campaign before. </p> <p>In the primaries she supported Hillary Clinton. \"There's too much at stake to sit this one out,\" she says.</p> <p>A look at the big picture suggests that these small efforts are paying off for Obama. <a href=\"http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/cms/documents/2008_Statistics/Oct/Statewide_Statistics_by_Locality.pdf\">Numbers</a> released by the Virginia state board of elections for September show that the increase in the number of registered voters in Roanoke city, which is Democratic and one quarter black, is more than double that of Roanoke county, which is Republican and 5% black over the past year. </p> <p>Over the past month the city has seen more than three times the increase of registered voters as the county. This reflects a trend that is both <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/02/obama_campaign_clears_its_va_v.html\"> statewide</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/05/AR2008100502524.html?hpid=top\">nationwide</a> news with traditionally Democratic areas far exceeding Republican areas and, where you can register by party, Democrats massively outpacing Republicans. </p> <p>With voter registration drawing to a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-10-05-voterreg_N.htm\">close</a> all over the country this marks the end of the beginning for Obama's ground game. </p> <p>His task was to not just to win over the electorate but to expand it and therefore change the calculus. So far so good. </p> <p>Now comes the hard work. Keeping them energised and making sure that they show up. The Obama campaign predict that 80% of the new registered voters in Virginia are Democrats and that three quarters of them will show up on election day. </p> <p>Which brings us to the final challenge. Making sure that the votes are <a href=\"http://www.toledofreepress.com/2008/10/03/court-curbs-move-to-exclude-voters/\">counted</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Citigroup is flexing its muscles in a tug-of-war for control of struggling Wachovia through an aggressive legal and financial effort to defeat a rival bid by California-based Wells Fargo.</p> <p>Furious at being gazumped when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy\">Wells Fargo tabled a $15bn (\u00a38.6bn) offer</a> on Friday, Citigroup's executives indicated that they are willing to broaden a $2.2bn offer for Wachovia's high-street banking network.</p> <p>A source close to the negotiations said Citigroup was open to buying the entirety of Wachovia, including its financial advisory services, stockbroker AG Edwards and asset management firm Evergreen, for a price similar to Wells Fargo's bid.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is keen to find a compromise to avert the prospect of a long, damaging battle for Wachovia, which could undermine the North Carolina-based group's already fragile condition.</p> <p>One suggestion on the table is to divide Wachovia's network of 3,300 branches with Wells Fargo taking those in California and the south-east of the US and Citigroup getting outlets in the north-east.</p> <p>Such an arrangement would avert the prospect of litigation which could drag on for months. A flurry of legal activity began over the weekend as Citigroup and Wells Fargo took their differences to New York state's supreme court.</p> <p>Court papers provide a glimpse into the extent of Wachovia's problems. In a legal filing, Wachovia disclosed that when it agreed a deal in principle with Citigroup a week ago, it was within hours of being shut down by banking regulators.</p> <p>Wachovia said it spoke to Citigroup \"with the understanding that a seizure of its banking assets later that day by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp would occur\" unless it secured a deal.</p> <p>Wachovia had been the US's fourth largest commercial bank by assets before the industry shake-out began. It holds $447bn of deposits, serves 15 million customers and employs 120,000 people. It has been brought to its knees by vast liabilities as borrowers defaulted on mortgages.</p> <p>Citigroup executives were confident they had sealed a deal to buy Wachovia until the early hours of Friday morning when they learned that Wells Fargo had trumped their offer. Furious insiders say that Citigroup had a signed exclusivity agreement for negotiations with Wachovia and that Citi was never given an opportunity to respond to Wells Fargo's offer. Citigroup's shares slumped 8% in early trading yesterday.</p> <p>On Saturday, a judge at New York state's supreme court sided with Citigroup by extending its period of exclusivity in discussions with Wachovia. But late on Sunday, an appeal court overturned this decision, shifting the balance back in Wells Fargo's favour. </p> <p>Paul Miller, an analyst at stockbroker Friedman Billings Ramsay, said he believed Wells Fargo would ultimately secure Wachovia to create a \"national banking powerhouse\".</p> <p>\"Citigroup is attempting to enforce its exclusivity agreement for Wachovia or increase its offer, but we expect that Wells Fargo should eventually prevail,\" he said in a note to clients.</p> <p>So far this year, 13 high-street banks have failed in the US, including last month's collapse of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, the biggest retail banking collapse on record. As in Europe, regulators are keen to stem any erosion of public confidence in banks.</p> <p>In an unexpected twist, lawyers have suggested that an obscure clause in the US government's $700bn banking bail-out package could invalidate Citigroup's claim of exclusivity. The clause liberalises takeover talks between banks in a measure intended to lessen the likelihood of failures.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bank of America has struck an $8.4bn deal with law enforcement authorities to settle a slew of investigations over the conduct of Countrywide Financial, its newly acquired mortgage lender.<br> Bank of America will modify mortgages for 400,000 people by reducing interest rates or cutting principal loan amounts. This will avert the prospect of prosecution by attorney generals in several US states who have alleged that Countrywide systematically mis-sold home loans.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Manchester. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Nicola Varley (words), Dego Brown (producer).<br> <strong><br>The background:</strong> Nicola Varley aka Envy, an MC from Manchester, is the fourth such British female all-rapping, angry rhyme-spitting, keyboard-wielding artist to appear in this column in 2008, hot on the heels (actually, trainers) of Lele[SPEAKS], Charli XCX and Goldielocks. And so we are probably going to have to talk in terms of a scene, a movement, even a new wave or generation of something or other here. But a new wave of what? Laptop ladies? Grime-pop grrrls? Dubstep divas? Whatever the appellation, there's no doubting their genealogy - they probably wouldn't have existed without Lady Sovereign and Lily Allen - or their crossover potential. It surely can't be long before one of them does a Dizzee or Wiley and has a break-out hit. <br> Varley, who has toured with Kano and G-Unit, has as much chance as any of them. She's feisty as hell, dissing \"wastemen\" (vernacular for playa) on Player, haters on Lullaby and ugly (or rather \"butters\", to use the street argot) geezers on new single Friday Night. Her flow is fast yet controlled \u2013 apparently, she's always been a quick talker, even as a kid. But it's a fluid attack, and it suits the sounds she and producer Dego Brown create: crisp, minimalist electronica. Words and music are inventive: she's not just some Moss Side Kappa Slappa spewing out half-witted diss-sections of chav culture and modern romance: she's studying Media at Loughborough University and her lyrics, if you can hear them (you might need a vari-speed facility), are well smart, with the wry, pithy intelligence of the media-savvy: \"I take it tit for tat/I'll take your tacit consent/To turn the Taliban to take over your town\u2026 You're lookin' to be loved but can't find a flippin' solution/I'm lost on location, laceratin' as I'm lacin'/Lookin' lovely/Better pray your label pay for elocution,\" she rapid-fires over the bubblicious grime rhythms, with their shades of Missy's Work It, of previous single Tongue Twister. We're not sure what she means or who the subject is of her ire here, but as ever she sounds fierce yet witty, her staccato delivery popping in time to the buzzing, fizzing synth beat. In fact, so rhythmic is her phrasing that it would sound good a cappella, but it works both ways: remove her rhymes and you've got pristine future-perfect electro-pop.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Envy's flow is cool, unhurried and smacks of future stardom.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We're not sure about \"cool\" \u2013 she's sounds fired-up. \"Unhurried\"? Her delivery is fast, although we're talking speed with style here, not spittle-y urgency. But \"stardom\"? Could be. <br> <strong><br>Most likely to:</strong> Make sick records. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make you sick. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Friday Night is released by Stopstart on November 10.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Lele[SPEAKS], Goldielocks, Charli XCX, Lady Sovereign. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/envy06\">www.myspace.com/envy06</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Lisa Mitchell.</p>",
  "<p>In my Philadelphia home the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/audio\">radio</a> is perma-tuned to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/ \">National Public Radio</a> - the subsidised network whose gently burbling collegiate conservatism is all but indistinguishable from the BBC World Service. But now and then - when NPR's touchy-feely niceness gets a bit much - I switch over to the dark side. By which I mean rightwing talk radio. </p> <p>The last time was on the day of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/23/uselections2008.hillaryclinton1 .\">the Pennsylvanian Democratic primaries</a>. It was a sad and disturbing experience. Rightwing talk radio seemed to be suffering from a crisis of confidence. One commentator tried to make a case for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> being an elitist. Because he'd used the word \"buffet\". </p> <p>Gone was the on-message swagger that had infused talk radio since the time of <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=su1CDbnBxzg\">Newt Gingrich's Contract With America</a>, and it wasn't hard to figure out why. The news spoke volumes about the collapse of American conservatism: rising gas prices, falling house prices, school shootings, a collapsing stock market, two more marines dead in Iraq - and a conservative religious cult allegedly raping their kids down in Texas.</p> <p>The ads were even more revealing. Credit card debt relief scams, get-rich-quick schemes, teenage celibacy programs, gun safes, how to tame your kids, help with addiction to prescription drugs and <a href=\"http://www.colonhealthmagazine.com/colon-products-review/evercleanse.html\">EverCleanse</a> - guaranteed to remove the \"20 to 25 pounds of unwanted waste that some experts say is trapped in your body\".</p> <p>The medium was totally at odd with the message, as if Joseph Goebbels' propaganda speeches were punctuated with ads for Swiss bank accounts, bomb shelters and quick'n'easy Russian language lessons. </p> <p>Last week \u2013 amidst more economic collapse and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's</a> disastrous interview on CBS News - I decided to stick my head back inside the rightwing talk radio bubble. </p> <p>The news is still terrible. And the ads are still targeted at debt-ridden gun-owners with compacted fecal matter clinging to their colon walls. But there was a bounce to rightwing talk.</p> <p>Last week saw the vice presidential debate. And Sarah Palin did not drool. This is hailed as a major victory. <a href=\"http://townhall.com/Columnists/MikeGallagher/2008/03/07/barack_hussein_obama\">Michael Gallagher</a> says \"Barack 'I don't mind babies being allowed to die on a table during partial birth abortions' Obama\" must be quaking. </p> <p>\"She didn't hit it out of the park,\" says Mike. \"But she didn't need to hit it out of the park.\" </p> <p>\"She hit it out of the park!\" crows a listener. </p> <p>\"Yes she did,\" agrees Mike. \"She hit it out of the park.\"</p> <p>Palin starts the day as the totally-out-of-her-depth local politician. She ends it a cross between Joan of Arc and Babe Ruth. </p> <p>Gallagher is meantime feigning outrage that Obama supporters are planning to protest outside a Palin/McCain attended event. Because protest is undemocratic. He then learns that the Obama supporters are outnumbered by Palin/McCain counter-demonstrators. This causes Gallagher to reminisce about the time he bussed a bunch of \"patriotic Americans\" down to Bush's pseudo-ranch in Crawford Texas to harass <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/dec/09/usa.iraq\">Cindy Sheehan</a> - the anti-war protester who lost a son in Iraq - with chants of \"we don't care\". Good times, good times \u2026</p> <p>But this is all just a warm up for the main event, the man who embodies rightwing talk radio - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/radio.usa \">Rush Limbaugh</a>. </p> <p>Rush limbers up with an all-out assault on the number one problem facing America after eight years of George W Bush - socialism. </p> <p>That's why Katie Couric of CBS news ambushed Palin \"with her gotcha questions and her ghoulish follow-ups and her even more vicious editing\" because \"we are up against a party and a press that is of one mind, that sees an historic opportunity here to advance their far left radical agenda\". </p> <p>Rush may be cockahoop for Palin: </p> <p>\"Holy cow! Hubba hubba, dooba dooba \u2026 How great this woman could be if she was let loose \u2026\" </p> <p>But it's on the economy that Rush gets really trippy. </p> <p>\"Nobody talks about what got us into this problem in the first place,\" says Rush. </p> <p>Can you guess what that that thing was? It was \"loaning money to minorities and poor people who could not pay it back. This was Marxist social engineering. This was affirmative action via mortgage.\"</p> <p>And then he mock-whispers: \"But nobody dares say it!\" </p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/10/02/limbaugh/\">the same Rush Limbaugh</a> who accused the Philadelphia Eagles' Donovan McNabb of being an affirmative action quarterback. </p> <p>And Barack Obama of being <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovF-f8bkTU\">an affirmative action candidate</a>. </p> <p>And who refers to his black listeners as \"brothers and sisters from the hood\". And has repeatedly played the comedy track <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6642029.stm\">Barack the Magic Negro</a>. </p> <p>Then Rush - who is incredibly rich - brings it all together. Quoting extensively from an article by \"swift boat author\" Brad O'Leary (whose new book, The Audacity of Deceit: Barack Obama's War on American Values, has just been published), Rush burbles about Obama's \"war on success\", the victims of which are \"successful, hardworking, tax-paying Americans\".</p> <p>\"Oh my God, I think I'm going to be sick,\" says my wife. Me, I feel like I'm tripping. </p> <p>Then you start to realise what a genius this man is. No matter how wrong he is proved, Rush Limbaugh is always able to soothe American conservatives by pointing his finger.</p> <p>It's not your fault, he tells his listeners. It's the others. The poor, the working class, the minorities. And big government. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200810/of-jock-straps-and-conspiracy-theories\">Recent research</a> has suggested a link between powerlessness and a tendency to believe in \"magical thinking\". Rush could have told them that for free.</p> <p>It's no wonder he's a multimillionaire. Rush is OxyContin soup for the conservative soul.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.conducting.org/\">Donatella Flick Conducting Competition</a>. You couldn't make it up: if anybody in the world was born to create a conducting competition, it was Donatella Flick, a name that drips with Euro-glamour and suggests the physical movements - the flicks, sweeps, and waves - that the prize rewards for the best podium show-pony. <br> Donatella \u2013 yes, she really exists \u2013 set up the biennial competition in 1990, in order to give young conductors a chance to shine, and a meaningful career break. This is much more than an upmarket maestro: the first prize is a cheque for \u00a315,000, and even more importantly, the chance to work with the London Symphony Orchestra as their assistant conductor for a year. Last Thursday night was the <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=7179\">final of 2008's event at the Barbican in London</a>, with the LSO the willing guinea-pigs for the three young maestri, whittled down from a field of 20 at the beginning of the week, and a field of 85 before that. I've never been before, and apart from the mindless royalist genuflection (<a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page5564.asp\">HRH the Duke of Kent was in attendance</a> - do we really need to stand up for the national anthem just because some heir or other happens to make it down to a concert hall?) the final was a fascinating demonstration of the difference a good \u2013 and a bad \u2013 conductor can make on even greatest of our orchestras. <br> The lucky triumvirate (26 year-old French Ariane Matiakh, and two men, Brit Michael Francis, 32, and 23 year-old German David Afkham) all played Verdi's Forza del Destino Overture (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYVq8M7ybs\">the Stella Artois advert, among other things</a>) and a choice of Brahms's Haydn Variations, Ravel's Second Suite from Daphnis and Chlo\u00e9, and Siegfried's Rhein Journey and Funeral Music from G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. Ariane went first, and produced a leaden, uninvolving account of the Verdi, and a performance of the Brahms that made both the music and the orchestra sound dull and lumpen. The problem was her gestures: she obviously knew the music well enough, but couldn't communicate any spark of vitality to the players, and seemed content just to get through the piece. This was Brahms as the \"leviathan maunderer\" of George Bernard Shaw's description. Not good. <br> At the other end of the spectrum, there was a crackle of electricity from the very first bar of Michael Francis's Verdi. Perhaps it's no surprise he inspired the LSO: he has been a member of the orchestra's double-bass section, has worked as Valery Gergiev's assistant, and already given concerts with them. You could see the stamp of his mentor in his body language, with his tremulous left hand and animal energy in the loud, exciting moments. Yet his Ravel was ill-disciplined. It's one thing to be excited all the time by the music and the performance, but if you make the first climax as noisy as the last, you can't control the bigger structure of the music. The LSO gave a dazzling performance, and relished the way Francis let them off the leash, even if the result was musically limited. Still, if the performance didn't cohere, he communicated more genuine passion in one bar than Matiakh did in her whole performance.  So it was left to the German candidate to produce the best performance of the evening \u2013 and to <a href=\"http://www.conducting.org/news.html\">walk away with the prizes, the cheque and the job</a>. David Afkham combined control with insight in his Verdi. If individual moments weren't as exciting as in Francis's performance, the overall experience was much more satisfying. Judged by the highest standards, he and the LSO did not play the Wagner well. It's unfamiliar territory for the players, and Afkham failed to find the mystery or the grandeur of Wagner's most visionary music. But he's got a lifetime to do that: what he did do was show that he can command a large ensemble with authority and occasional inspiration. 2006's winner, Michal Dworzynski, had his breakthrough when he stood in with the LSO for Daniel Harding (\"potentially a force to be reckoned with\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/oct/13/classicalmusicandopera2\">Tim Ashley said in his review last October</a>). I'd be surprised if Afkham didn't also take his chance sometime next season.</p>",
  "<p>Opposition parties have accused the government of backing away from radical schools reform after Lord Adonis, schools minister and architect of academies, was moved to transport.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, said education reformers would be \"disturbed\" to hear of Adonis's departure.</p> <p>He said: \"Everyone who believes in the integrity of the academies programme and the reform agenda in education will be disturbed to hear that Ed Balls has kicked Andrew Adonis out of the education department.</p> <p>\"The fact that Lord Adonis has been moved from his post only emphasises how this reshuffle is about rewarding cronies and not about governing in the national interest.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat schools spokesman, David Laws, called the decision a \"disgrace\".</p> <p>\"It looks at if Ed Balls has succeeded in forcing out a minister who he saw as a threat to both his primacy and his statist instincts.</p> <p>\"The real losers here will be thousands of children in some of the poorest parts of the country who were being targeted by the academies programme.</p> <p>\"We can now be sure that all of the momentum will seep away from the academies programme, which will continue to exist in form but not in substance.\"</p> <p>He said ministers had used the distraction of Mandelson's return to \"strangle\" one of the last elements of reform of public services.</p> <p>\"In the short run, this decision may give some sense of gratification to the Luddites of old Labour. In the longer term, it will surely help pave the way for the departure of this discredited and directionless administration,\" Laws said.</p> <p>A Department of Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) spokeswoman said: \"In the relatively short time they have been operating, academies have made remarkable progress and the programme has been accelerated over the past year. The Government is committed to opening 400 new academies \u2013 on current trajectory we will have achieved this by 2012.</p> <p>\"Academies work and are giving new opportunities to children in disadvantaged communities. Those with results for both 2006 and 2007 showed a rate of improvement at GCSE of over three times the national average. They are also popular with parents and are heavily oversubscribed.\"</p> <p>Adonis has played a pivotal role in developing the academies programme, which was at the heart of Tony Blair's education policy and designed to free every school from local authority control.</p> <p>Unusually for a junior minister, he had independence and autonomy to run the academies programme, a situation about which Balls is said to have been less than enthusiastic.</p> <p>Adonis's move to transport is reported to have been a \"complete surprise\" to officials in the DCSF. Adonis is, however, known to be a \"transport nut\" and his new post as minister of state, rather than parliamentary secretary, is seen as a promotion.</p> <p>A source associated with the academies programme said: \"People don't know what the implications are. They don't know yet which minister will pick up the academies programme.</p> <p>\"The programme needs a very strong push from central government and Adonis provided that push.</p> <p>\"If Ed Balls was to make a strong statement making clear the academies programme was going ahead, that would be one scenario.</p> <p>\"But if there's lack of clarity about his commitment to it or what we're really trying to do it would be quite difficult to drive the programme forward.\"</p> <p>Any perceived reduction in government backing for the programme would make it easier for reluctant local authorities to \"shrug their shoulders and not do much\", the source said.</p> <p>Earlier this year Balls announced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jun/10/schools.uk4\">National Challenge</a> programme to improve the performance of schools where fewer than 30% of children get five A* to C grade GCSEs including English and maths.</p> <p>Under the programme, one of the options for struggling schools is to turn into an academy.</p> <p>\"The National Challenge programme is Ed's flagship and that doesn't sit entirely happily with academies. There are clearly differences of emphasis in the two programmes,\" the source added.</p> <p>Academies have drawn fire for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/19/schools.education\">excluding pupils</a> and not extending the same rights to teachers as in other state schools.</p> <p>The reshuffle has seen other ministers involved in education given new responsibilities. The higher education minister, Bill Rammell, has been moved from the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills to the Foreign Office to cover the Middle East.</p> <p>Rammell visited the Middle East to dampen fears of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/08/highereducation.uk3\">boycott of Israeli academics</a> last year. He was formerly in the FO from 2002 to 2005.</p> <p>Rammell came under fire for the department's guide on extremism on campus earlier this year, which sparked a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jun/05/highereducation.uk2\">debates over academic freedom</a>.</p> <p>Lord Drayson has joined Dius as science minister, replacing science minister Ian Pearson, who will now have a split role between Treasury and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. </p> <p>Baroness Delyth Morgan will swap her role as students' minister for a position in the Department for Children, Schools and Families. </p> <p>Jim Knight, the schools minister, will take on responsibility for academies, trusts and specialist schools.

  "<p>The smooth, handsome Frenchman lounged lazily against a post, emanating a cool air and watching the world pass him by, shrugging nonchalantly and barely flinching as it did. Chaos surrounded him but he stood silently, accompanied by the most profound of thoughts, a gaze of serene resignation on his face, hands resting gently on his hips. You almost expected him to draw philosophically from a Gitanes and pull up his collar as the mist swirled off the Seine. </p> <p>Only Gr\u00e9gory Coupet wasn't wearing a collar: he was wearing the luminous jersey of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/atleticomadrid\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> goalkeeper and he stood a thousand kilometres from the Left Bank, 75,000 people looking down upon him first in expectation and then in giggling joy as 10 men in red and white protested and 10 men in red and blue embraced. It wasn't just that the world had passed him by, drifting easily out of reach; it was that the ball had too. That the game had done the same and that the season could follow; that the thoughts going through Coupet's mind were brooding ones \u2014 shared by <em>atl\u00e9ticos</em> everywhere. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona\">FC Barcelona</a> versus Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Camp Nou. It was the event they'd been building up for seven days and it had barely lasted seven minutes. It was, they said, a contest between two classic clubs, serious contenders for the title; between Leo Messi and Sergio Aguero to find the world's best footballer. But, like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/oct/08/europeanfootball.barcelona\">the last time</a> the two Argentine <em>pibes</em> met at the top of the Camp Nou bill \u2014 the two New Maradonas, successor and son-in-law, Olympic room-mates and PlayStation rivals \u2014 it was no contest.</p> <p>Not so much because Messi destroyed Aguero, although he was breathtakingly brilliant, but because Bar\u00e7a destroyed Atl\u00e9tico. Because Atl\u00e9tico destroyed themselves. </p> <p>The match was just eight minutes old when Barcelona won a free-kick on the edge of the Atl\u00e9tico area. Messi and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez stood over it. So did Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda. Coupet was leaning against his post when Messi casually curled the ball over a wall so badly constructed you'd think gelatinous genius Jes\u00fas Gil had come back from the dead with some bogus planning permission tucked under his arm, sending it bouncing softly into the net. While Coupet stood motionless, Atl\u00e9tico's outfield players surrounded the referee but to no avail: replays showed Messi being told he could take it and the only resistance Garc\u00eda offered was to spit at the ball. Because that'll stop it. </p> <p>\"It was all over right there,\" sighed Atl\u00e9ti coach Javier Aguirre. Which might sound like an exaggeration with 84 minutes still remaining and Atl\u00e9ti captain Maxi Rodr\u00edguez taking just five of them to score. But it wasn't. Because Messi's goal wasn't Barcelona's first, it was their third, and two more would follow in 20 minutes, three more overall, as Bar\u00e7a scored six for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/sep/22/sportinggijon.barcelonaes\">second time in four La Liga matches</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/may/21/europeanfootball.atleticomadrid\">second time in four matches with Atl\u00e9tico</a>.</p> <p>Samuel Eto'o got two, Rafa M\u00e1rquez and Eidur Gudjohnsen scored one each and Thierry Henry rounded it off brilliantly, but it didn't end there: Andr\u00e9s Iniesta hit the post twice and Messi almost got the goal of the season. </p> <p>\"Ooooh!\" ran the cover of El Mundo Deportivo, below an advert for their current cul\u00e9 collection \u2014 Bar\u00e7a knives. AS called it \"orgasmic\", Sport insisted it was \"a game to frame\" and La Vanguardia obeyed, declaring Barcelona's performance \"monumental, a work of art, an oil painting\". \"No one will forget,\" they said, \"such an exhibition of goals, of beauty and ambition. It was a game to remember, to analyse, to fall in love with.\"</p> <p>Not for Atl\u00e9tico, it wasn't. And as for the analysis, if it's hard to judge how good Barcelona really were having been given such a flying start, it's easier to judge how bad Atl\u00e9tico were: very, very bad. Barcelona's first three were gifts, coming during what one columnist described as \"the most idiotic eight minutes in history\". And no matter how much president Enrique Cerezo dismissed the result as \"illogical\" and \"an accident\", no matter how much he had a point, some fear Atl\u00e9tico have been found out; that the side that looked like genuine contenders aren't.</p> <p>After all, they've already lost three, are seven points off the top, and have come unstuck just as the key games begin: 1-0 losers against Sevilla, 6-1 losers against Barcelona, Real Madrid are up next and then it's Villarreal. Two defeats and they could be 13 points off the pace.</p> <p>Worryingly for Atl\u00e9ti, against Barcelona it was the players who are supposed to be good who were particularly bad. The normally reliable Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda turned his back on Messi's free kick, new signing Paulo Assun\u00e7ao is supposed to boss the midfield but was utterly irrelevant and new centre-back Tomas Ujfalusi announced it was good to be scary but this time only frightened his own fans, losing his man on the opening goal and conceding a dumb penalty for the second. Javier Aguirre's policy of rotating his goalies, lauded in the week, no longer looks so bright either \u2014 especially with the side struggling on set-plays. </p> <p>Worse still, Saturday night seemed to confirm that Atl\u00e9ti simply can't afford to suffer injuries \u2014 especially not now. Missing Diego Forl\u00e1n, Giourkas Seitaridis, Maniche and Simao Sabrosa, their 21-man squad can't cope. Most people had never heard of the players on the bench on Saturday night. They don't have a single right-back, a decent defensive midfielder, a creative midfielder or a genuine left-winger.</p> <p>They do have a replacement for Forl\u00e1n in Florent Sinama-Pongolle but it's not the same. Now Maxi is struggling too and Aguero is hobbling from game to game, fending off groin and ankle injuries, on the verge of a breakdown. Besides, by the time El Kun first touched the ball in open play on Saturday night he'd already had three touches from dead balls. Kick-offs, to be precise. And when that happens, even he hasn't got a hope in hell of matching Messi. Or beating Barcelona. </p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Barcelona 6-1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Deportivo 1-0 Numancia, Getafe 2-2 Almeria, Mallorca 0-2 Sporting Gijon, Osasuna 0-1 Racing Santander, Real Madrid 2-2 Espanyol, Recreativo Huelva 0-4 Malaga, Sevilla 4-0 Athletic Bilbao, Valladolid 0-1 Valencia, Villarreal 2-1 Real Betis<br><a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29\">Latest La Liga table</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Well,\" said Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, today after chairing the Metropolitan police authority's first meeting since he, in effect, sacked Sir Ian Blair last week. \"I think we have had a pretty good morning.\" And he beamed genially across City Hall's council chamber at the stunned members of the MPA.</p> <p>A pretty good two hours that is, except for the fact that the mayor had been castigated first for the way he dismissed Blair, then for not consulting members about the dismissal, then for announcing unilaterally that he was setting up an inquiry into race and faith issues within the Met, then for the proposed manner of that review, then for not consulting about that, then for announcing he was voting for a motion that had not been put, then for declaring the meeting prematurely closed before it completed its agenda and finally for unilaterally deciding who would chair the MPA's committees. </p> <p>\"Much food for thought there,\" as he himself said at one point.</p> <p>If there seems to be something of a non-consultative pattern here, there was also a pattern of consecutive repentance. </p> <p>\"Sorry, sorry, sorry,\" he said time and again. When confronted with a critical motion, accusing him of usurping his powers over Blair's dismissal, he said disarmingly: \"Thank you very much. I don't disagree with your motion at all. I think it's eminently sensible \u2026 Thank you very, very much everybody.\"</p> <p>Welcome to the court of Mayor Boris. If the meeting occasionally resembled a politer version of Have I Got News For You, with Johnson as a one-man odd-one-out round, it was not for want of the mayor's trying. </p> <p>He tried very hard to butter the police and the authority up. He was very privileged, he said, to be there - having taken charge of the MPA only last week - in charge of the only police force in the world where tourists queued up to buy souvenir plastic police helmets. It was a force that did not operate by arbitrary authority - he said this with no perceptible hint of irony - and which was celebrated for its helpfulness, fairness and upholding of the law. He was certainly not going to micro-manage it. His door would always be open - clearly this was not an invitation to burglars - and he was always willing to learn: \"I do want to work hand in glove with you,\" he declared.</p> <p>Pressed about the way Blair's dismissal was handled, he insisted: \"The chances of anything like this happening again are extremely, vanishingly remote and the vast majority of people will agree with that.\" </p> <p>Asked how widely he had consulted about the move, the mayor insisted the consultations had been widespread. A quick round of hands showed a majority of members had not been consulted. </p> <p>\"This is becoming undignified,\" said Johnson. After two hours it was over. As he hastily closed the meeting, the mayor said with relief: \"Thank you very much. See you next month.\"</p>",

It begins one day 20 years ago, in Miami airport:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Mary Menth Andersen was 31 years old at the time, and had just married Norwegian Dag Andersen. She was looking forward to starting a new life in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in Vestfold with him. But first she had to get all of her belongings across to Norway... At the airport in Miami things were hectic as usual, with long lines at the check-in counters. When it was finally Mary's turn and she had placed her luggage on the baggage line, she got the message that would crush her bubbling feeling of happiness. \"You'll have to pay a $103 surcharge if you want to bring both those suitcases to Norway,\" the man behind the counter said.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But Mary had no money, and no friends she could call; the man behind the counter wasn't willing to negotiate. \"I was completely desperate, and tried to think which of my things I could manage without,\" she recalls: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I started to cry. Tears were pouring down my face and I had no idea what to do. Then I heard a gentle and friendly voice behind me saying 'That's OK, I'll pay for her.'\" Mary turned around to see a tall man whom she had never seen before.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's right, everyone: John McCain. No, not really! John McCain is not tall, and if he'd been held up in an airport queue he'd be boiling with rage at this point.</p> <blockquote> <p>He was nicely dressed, fashionably dressed with brown leather shoes, a cotton shirt open at the throat, and khaki pants, says Mary. She was thrilled to be able to bring both her suitcases to Norway, and assured the stranger that he would get his money back. The man wrote his name and address on a piece of paper that he gave to Mary. She thanked him repeatedly. When she finally walked off towards the security checkpoint, he waved goodbye to her.</p> <p>The piece of paper said \"Barack Obama.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mary eventually paid the young community organiser back, and years later, her parents exchanged correspondence with Obama. Mary and her husband now have the letter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338325654\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/6/1223304859433/couple.jpg\" alt=\"Couple\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Due to having had my soul almost entirely corroded with cynicism as a result of working too long as a journalist, I feel a barely resistible urge to be sarcastic about this story. But it's kind of touching, actually. Read the rest at <a href=\"http://leishacamden.blogspot.com/2008/10/not-that-it-matters.html\">Leisha Camden's blog</a>. And start guessing how it'll be incorporated into Sarah Palin's next stump speech, because don't you think Americans deserve to know that Barack Obama is a man who thinks the United States is so imperfect that he's willing to lend people money to help them leave it to go to Europe, or wherever the darn heck Norway is?</p>",

There are even a few jokes, if you find the \"heavy metal umlaut\" amusing (which we do).</p> <p>Not much there, you might think, to cause poor Rod's blood pressure to soar off the scale. But \u2013 in common with all media style guides \u2013 we also include some guidelines on writing about potentially tricky areas such as asylum, mental illness, race and so on. And these are what seem to have caused him such angst.</p> <p>I'm not sure, however, if he has actually read the book. It doesn't, for example, ban the word \"grandmother\": what it advises our writers is to mention that someone is a grandparent only when relevant, and to \"leave 'battling grannies' and other examples of ageism and sexism to the tabloids\". Now Rod is entitled to think the Guardian should write about battling grannies, but he extends this to argue, in effect, that we should not be concerned at all with the words we use because to do so removes what he calls the \"implicit or subliminal connotations\" of language and makes the paper \"far less colourful\".</p> <p>There follows a list of words that the Guardian avoids, apparently to Rod's chagrin, such as \"active homosexual\", \"career women\", \"committed suicide\", \"crippled\", \"handicapped\", \"hare lip\", \"Siamese twins\", \"spinster\", and others, including \"illegal asylum seeker\" (a term the normally placid <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/\">Press Complaints Commission</a> ruled in breach of its code of practice).</p> <p>The logic of this argument is that we should still be writing about mongols, nutters, schizos and spastics. I don't doubt that using language that civilised people were finding offensive or outdated 50 years ago would make life more \"colourful\". You could say the same of cockfighting and public executions ... which brings me to Rod's followers, bless them.</p> <p>The comments from some Spectator readers at the end of the piece reveal a hatred of the Guardian out of all proportion to the debate. These people make Sarah Palin look like a liberal wimp. The Guardian is a nest of \"Marxists, deconstructing the English language, as well as the rest of our culture\". We are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth\">Orwell's Ministry of Truth</a>. We are carrying out \"thought-control experiments\" (worse: they are somehow funded by the taxpayer!). Our readers, I need hardly add, are \"stupid and blinkered\".</p> <p>Now it's unfair to damn a man because of the company he keeps, but I'm going to do it anyway. Yes: the fearless media commentator and scourge of the politically correct, Stephen Glover, has joined Rod's barmy army in his <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/comment/stephen-glover/stephen-glover-on-the-press-it-has-its-faults-but-we-should-be-proud-of-the-british-press-952294.html\">Independent column today</a>. The Guardian Book of English Language is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 politically correct! If he had read the book more closely, he might have paused to consider our definition of that phrase: \"a term to be avoided on the grounds that it is, in Polly Toynbee's words, 'an empty rightwing smear designed only to elevate its user'.\"</p>",
  "<p>My husband and I have never fought over the television. Oh, <a href=\"http://www.collinspartners.com/relationships/5reasonscouplesbreakup.html\">we've argued about other things</a>, like the time right after we moved in together when we couldn't agree on the proper way to load the dishwasher, or the time I scolded him for folding his T-shirts badly. We can argue about what to have for dinner or what to do on the weekend, just not the TV. Why? Well, we have a <a href=\"http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=\" dvr\" \">DVR</a> for one thing, so I can watch <a href=\"http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway/season/5/index.php\">Project Runway</a> while he does other things, and he can watch <a href=\"http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/\">Battlestar Galactica</a> without me making fun of the word \"frack\". </p> <p>The ability to record one show while watching another or just to record shows that air at inconvenient times is certainly a nice tool. But <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504167.html\">new statistics</a> from the <a href=\"http://people-press.org/\">Pew Research Centre</a> give us reason to think the DVR may be more than just a convenience. The statistics show that couples share control of the television, and not only that, but that women are more frequently in control of the remote than men. Analysts say these findings indicate a larger trend \u2013 that men and women share authority in their homes now more than in generations past when a man's home was his castle and the TV his jester. <br> This trend is interesting because of the multiple causes contributing to it. The technology is one thing, but even households without a DVR seem to be compromising more. That would suggest that in most relationships, it's no longer assumed that the man is always in charge and makes all the decisions. The fact that we are behaving more as equals in the privacy of our own homes, as opposed to legally mandated equality in the workplace, is a sign that we're now incorporating the ideals of equality into our lives in a genuine way. That is, we honestly see ourselves as equals and partners. Relationships in which men wield all the authority or \"wear the pants\" (a sexist phrase in itself), are gradually becoming the exception rather than the rule. </p> <p>Our relationships have always been evolving, but technology is contributing immensely and undeniably to that evolution. We all remember our parents and grandparents sitting in front of the TV to unwind at the end of the day. As minor as it seemed, it was an essential part of the day. And in tune with the accepted gender roles of countless generations, the man held the remote. Socially speaking, our accepted gender roles have broadened, but technology has also given us tools that aid in this transition.<br> For one thing, we just don't sit down to watch TV anymore. We don't even turn on the evening news in many cases because we've got access to more news than we can actually digest online where we can get our information with a minimum of commercial interruptions. Having multiple sources for entertainment and information means we don't have to battle over a single TV.  Avoiding the ages-old argument over whether to watch The Simpsons or the evening news isn't the only way in which <a href=\"http://threeminds.organic.com/2008/10/play_time_technology_is_changi.html\">technology is changing the way people interact</a>. I remember the first time I used an online chat room \u2013 I thought it was amazing but basically a luxury and a frivolous pastime. I could not have imagined then that my job and many of my friendships would rely heavily on the internet for communication and research. In fact, some of my closest friends are people I only see a few times a year, and yet we're able to be in touch at any time. Chatting online doesn't replace physical proximity, but it can increase our feeling of connection to each other when we can't always be near our loved ones. </p> <p>The exciting thing about technology is the creative ways it can be used to both support and shape our lifestyles. Having a DVR can't make a couple get along better, but if they're looking for a way to resolve their differences in TV preference, it's a great tool. The truth is, I will never be able to watch Battlestar Galactica without wincing, but that doesn't mean my husband shouldn't get to enjoy it.</p>",
  "<p>Local hero Casey Stoner overcame a broken wrist to win yesterday's MotoGP race at Phillip Island, while newly-crowned champion Valentino Rossi put in a stunning comeback drive to secure second place. </p> <p>Stoner was in dominant form in his home race and it was Rossi who was on the back foot, the Italian recovering from a big qualifying accident that left him starting from twelfth position. He battled his way up the grid, however, and passed American Nicky Hayden on the last lap to secure the runners-up slot, with Hayden rounding out the podium finishers. </p> <p>\"We knew that the race was going to be hard, as normally you can't get away [well from pole] here, but we did,\" said Stoner. \"[Hayden] was with me for a while but then he seemed to drop off. To be world champion last year and in running for second this year is great. If we can challenge for the title again next year it will be fantastic, and if not for now the home victory is something that we can be happy with.\" </p> <p>Rossi's ride was impressive after he had suffered his worst qualifying performance of the season by falling during Saturday's session, leaving him with mild whiplash and damage to his neck muscles. \"I was pushing a lot with the qualifying tyre but unfortunately I went too wide at turn two and I came onto the grass on the exit,\" he said of the incident. \"I thought I could take the bike back onto the track but, as soon as I touched the muddy grass I lost control and I couldn\u00b4t stop it. Then I bumped my head and neck pretty hard when I landed in the gravel.\" </p> <p>James Toseland equalled his best-ever MotoGP finish with sixth place at the flag.</p>",

Photograph: Kobal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van Helsing and his intrepid band of vampire hunters might have disposed of Bram Stoker's creation Dracula more than a century ago, but a sequel to the novel by Stoker's great grand-nephew will see them under attack from the undead once again.</p> <p>Dacre Stoker delved into his ancestor's handwritten notes on the original Dracula novel to pen his sequel, Dracula: The Un-Dead - the original name for Dracula before an editor changed the title. The novel, out next October, draws on excised characters, existing character back-stories and plot threads that were cut from Stoker's original novel, first published 111 years ago.</p> <p>The new book is set in London in 1912, a quarter of a century after the Count apparently \"crumbled into dust\". Vampire-hunter Van Helsing's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Dr Seward is now a disgraced morphine addict, and Quincey, the son of Stoker's hero Jonathan, has become involved in a troubled theatre production of Dracula, directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself. The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them his father is found murdered, impaled in Piccadilly Circus. </p> <p>The original is written in classic epistolatory form, alternating between different narrators; the sequel adopts a more direct storytelling route. \"[This] makes it more immediately accessible to a modern thriller readership, while remaining faithful to the spirit and atmosphere of the Victorian original,\" said publisher Jane Johnson of HarperCollins UK.</p> <p>The book has caused a storm in the publishing world, selling for more $1m to Dutton US, HarperCollins UK and Penguin Canada. A film version is also in the works, with shooting expected to begin next June.</p> <p>Dacre Stoker, who formerly coached the Canadian Olympic Pentathlon team and now lives in the US, is writing the novel with Dracula historian Ian Holt, a screenwriter and member of The Transylvanian Society of Dracula. The Un-Dead is the first Dracula story to be fully authorised by the Stoker family since the 1931 film starring Bela Lugosi.</p> <p>Stoker, speaking to guardian.co.uk from a fishing trip in Tennessee, said he had initially been \"a little sceptical\" about the project to resurrect Bram Stoker's original themes and characters, which was dreamed up by Holt. \"Growing up, all the Stokers in my generation were pretty blas\u00e9 about the fact we were related to this great horror writer. At Halloween we'd get all these comments about 'are we going to get bitten if we go round to the Stokers?',\" he said, admitting that he only got around to reading his great grand-uncle's novel when he went to college. \"But Ian seemed to be the real deal.\"</p> <p>Stoker and Holt say they have each written equal amounts of the novel. \"When we started I was worried because Dacre had never written a novel before, but he was great,\" Holt said. \"I think I've got a little bit [of my ancestor's skills] in the bloodline,\" said Stoker, who spent some time researching the London of 1912 in order to write the book. \"We really needed to do the detail the way Bram did - we owed it to him,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At times we felt in a weird way that Bram was there with us as a third author,\" added Holt. \"We had his notes, and the stories and legends passed down through the family - we were able to give him back his legacy - reclaim Dracula for his roots.\" Stoker agreed. \"Our intent is to give both Bram and Dracula back their dignity. Maybe even more important is to give the novel's legions of loyal fans what they have been waiting over a century for...the return of the real Dracula.\"</p> <p>Stoker's original Dracula, the forefather of the wave of vampire novels currently flooding the bookshops, has never been out of print since it was published in 1897. The sequel will be competing with two other high profile vampire novels published next year: film director Guillermo del Toro's debut The Strain, about a vampiric virus which invades New York, and Justin Cronin's The Passage, about a vampire plague spawned by medical experiments.</p>",
  "<p>Unsourced reports have dropped from the sky. The prime minister has decided, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4887653.ece\">the Times says</a>, to either a) withdraw the 42-days clause from the anti-terrorism bill before it gets to the Lords \u2013 where it is due to be rejected by a decisive margin; or, b) announce that he will not attempt to use the Parliament Act to force it through both chambers in a year's time, when it is so defeated. </p> <p>Hurray!</p> <p>But assuming it proves to be true, what should we make of this considerable if defensive victory for the forces of progress? Especially when it remains the case that people can be held without charge in Britain for nearly a month and that three innocent victims have already been so incarcerated for 27 days <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/our_kingdom/an-abundance-of-caution\">and then released</a>? </p> <p>There is another way of putting this question. Would the defeat of 42 days show that our system is fundamentally sound and in good health, able to spit out poisonous proposals despite the executive? Or does the process suggest, as David Davis claimed when he stormed out of the Commons and forced a byelection, that the way the initial vote on 42 days went through the Commons demonstrates that Britain lacks a fundamentally sound democracy capable of preventing the \"strangulation of our freedom\"? </p> <p>It seems to me that there is indeed something deeply wrong. The entire 42-days episode is a symptom of the rottenness. Indeed, I'd put it more strongly. There is an authoritarian cancer in the British system that has metastasised. From the Treasury-inspired \"transformational government\", to local council CCTV, to <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4882622.ece\">the interception modernisation programme</a> that proposes to \"live tap\" all electronic communication, to ID cards \u2013 you name it, it seems, and they will be onto it \u2013 an official will is at work to police, control, arrest and expel. It regards restraints, from the Human Rights Act to parliamentary scrutiny as \"old thinking\". And it is turbo-charged by the huge funding opportunities that \"new thinking\" permits. </p> <p>However, I also think that even if we do not have a healthy body politic, we do have a healthy public attitude which can purge the cancer and cure the patient. The lamentable and shameful failure of anyone in the Labour government to resign over the 42 days motion, and the many good MPs who bent their spines and went through the \"yes\" lobby, should not overshadow the tremendous quality of the resistance and the learning process that has begun.</p> <p>Less than a week ago, Amnesty quietly launched a <a href=\"http://www.protectthehuman.com/42days\">new petition</a> designed to build a constituency-based campaign to ensure that any attempt to use the Parliament Act next year would, this time, be defeated in the Commons. Already nearly 3,000 have signed. During the build up and passage of the bill, Shami Chakrabarti of <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a> conducted an outstanding campaign of persuasion. She personified resistance without being cast as \"shill\", \"maverick\" or self-interested, a wonderful achievement. Most important of all she connected the assault on our liberties that arouses the Tory bile with the need to secure and defend our human rights which many of those same Tories despise.</p> <p>There were also some excellent speeches made in the Commons and the Lords opposing 42 days both in practice and in principle. There is something to build on here. A turning of the tide, perhaps, if that is not to watery a foundation? I sense a fear of not just the vote in the Lords but, even worse for Brown and his colleagues, an alarm at the power of the argument against 42 days and the hopelessness of the case in its favour. </p> <p>We specialise in this country in defensive campaigns, like the excellent <a href=\"http://www.no2id.net/\">NO2ID</a>. Now we need a positive movement that combines democracy, freedom and fundamental rights in the context of the need for government that the credit crunch has demonstrated. We are planning a gathering on modern liberty to do just this \u2013 please stand by for an announcement soon.</p>",
  "<p>The announcement that Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3046784/Jean-Charles-de-Menezes-inquest-Sir-Ian-Blair-tells-Metropolitan-Police-to-brace-itself-for-turbulence.html\">has launched an inquiry</a> into claims of racism at the Metropolitan police during the ongoing inquiry into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and just days after ousting Sir Ian Blair will throw the Met into chaos at the worst possible time for the beleaguered force. That acknowledged, the inquiry, which will be deeply resented by many senior and rank-and-file officers, is the right course of action \u2013 even if Johnson is doing it for the wrong, political reasons. <br> When I worked at the Commission for Racial Equality, we did a lot of painstaking, behind-the-scenes work with the Metropolitan police to encourage greater diversity in the force and to tackle the institutional racism highlighted by the 1999 <a href=\"http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/4262.htm\">Macpherson report</a>. A lot of this centred on positive action programmes within the force to allow black and Asian officers to progress fairly through the ranks, and positive recruitment campaigns targeted at ethnic minority communities. Crucially, it also focused on far better communication within the Met to explain why these changes were necessary and to ensure that white officers did not feel alienated by the process. <br> To the Met's credit, the force is now a little more representative of the community that it seeks to serve, and it has put in place processes and structures which are more effective at dealing with claims of racism within its lower ranks. However, where it has manifestly failed is in progressing sufficient numbers of ethnic minority officers up the ranks in the right way, in dealing effectively with accusations of racism among its most senior officers and in winning over the hearts and minds of the majority of white officers. The results <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/police.race\">are now all to plain to see</a>, with the Black Police Association threatening a recruitment boycott, a series of highly damaging rows over race including the prospect of senior officers facing an employment tribunal next year following the suspension of Tarique Ghaffur and a mushrooming, if rarely voiced, resentment among white officers that black and Asian colleagues are being promoted above their capabilities for \"politically correct\" reasons.<br> That Johnson should decide to use his first meeting as chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority to announce the inquiry reflects the fact that he remains extremely jumpy over issues to do with race, his critics claim, often reacting before finding out the full facts. During the mayoral election campaign, Johnson was badly burnt because he <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2007/12/10/boris-johnson-race-row-fury-89520-20228110/\">had once referred to black people as \"piccaninnies\"</a> and by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/aug/04/london.localgovernment\">comments from Doreen Lawrence</a>, mother of the murdered teenager Stephen, that he would \"destroy the city's unity\". Since then, the issue of race and judgment has come back to haunt Johnson, resulting in him losing his deputy chief of staff James McGrath in June for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/jun/23/firstletsexaminethetext\">making allegedly racist remarks</a>, and then accusations that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/05/boris.london\">failed to vet properly</a> his deputy mayor, Ray Lewis, Johnson's highest-profile black appointment, who subsequently was forced to resign in July. <br> The chair of the inquiry, Metropolitan Police Authority member <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/about/members/02butts.htm\">Cindy Butts</a>, will therefore have her work cut out to find a way forward for the Met that keeps Johnson, the BPA, senior officers and the rank and file on side \u2013 an almost impossible balancing act in the current political atmosphere. In trying to do so, she will have to avoid getting bogged down in the detail of high-profile individual cases like Ghaffur's, while at the same time tackling the causes of racism in the Met against black and Asian officers. Butts will also need to tackle head on a simmering resentment and wall of silence in the force, which she will face from many senior and white officers who are not racist, but believe that promotion needs to be based on merit and nothing else. Hers is an unenviable job.<br> The danger for the Met is that if Butts mishandles the inquiry, it risks alienating the public at exactly the time when the force faces some of its greatest logistical policing challenges, from terrorism to the 2012 Olympics. The danger for Boris Johnson is that the inquiry risks politicising the Met against him \u2013 exactly the same trap that Sir Ian Blair fell into.</p>",
  "<p>The average cow passes enough wind in a week to inflate a hot air balloon, 88% of clowns never fall in love and 36% of strippers had a convent education. We all know by now that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7rfitdqpzs&amp;feature=related\">88.2% of statistics are made up on the spot</a> but there's nothing false or frivolous about the numbers that will be troubling the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/juventus\">Juventus</a> manager Claudio Ranieri this morning. Zero wins from his team's last four games. Five goals scored in the opening six league games, where last year there were 15. The Old Lady's first home defeat to Palermo since February 18 1962.</p> <p>More troubling still, <a href=\"http://www.tuttosport.com/sondaggi/calcio/serie_a/juventus/risultati-27/Ranieri+deve+andarsene%3F?ok=true\">over 70% of Tuttosport readers</a> want to see him sacked. Granted, the Turin-based daily may not be the <em>most</em> impartial \u2013 they have been campaigning for the manager to be fired for some time, and today's front-page headline is a simple but effective \"Ranieri, out\" \u2013 but the vote is nevertheless indicative of significant discontent. Even before <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmRW8P2Shqc\">yesterday's 2-1 reverse</a>, the majority of Juventini wanted shot of the Tinkerman.</p> <p>Their grievances extend beyond simple results, though it has been noted that Juventus's current haul of nine points is their lowest after six games since the league moved to three points for a win in 1994-95. Ranieri has been criticised for his tactics, team selection and even his general demeanour. His ability to smile and joke with television presenters after a disappointing result has led to accusations that he doesn't care enough about losing to ever win big trophies. A training-ground row with Alessandro Del Piero last week added fuel to reports that Ranieri has lost control of the dressing room.</p> <p>Ranieri was careful to suppress said smile after yesterday's defeat, but he remained philosophical. \"Sometimes you're the anvil and sometimes the hammer,\" he mused. \"Right now we are the anvil.\"</p> <p>Such a fatalistic approach might be forgiven in light of injuries to Nicola Legrottaglie, Giorgio Chiellini, Jorge Andrade, Cristiano Zanetti, Jonathan Zebina, David Trezeguet and Vincenzo Iaquinta. Of the six changes Ranieri made to the team that drew with BATE Borisov in the Champions League in the week, three were forced by injury. Two more \u2013 the introductions of Christian Poulsen and Claudio Marchisio \u2013 were at least partly motivated by the need to give Mauro Camoranesi and Pavel Nedved's ageing legs a rest. Only the return of Gianluigi Buffon in place of Alex Manninger in goal was entirely a matter of preference.</p> <p>A thigh injury to Olof Mellberg little more than half an hour in only exacerbated the situation, as did Momo Sissoko's sending off five minutes before half-time, but Juventus were far from fluid even before then. Without Camoranesi and Nedved to link midfield and attack, Juventus were disjointed. They managed just four shots on target all game, and only one from open play. Only the 22-year-old Marchisio, who emerged from the youth team in 2006 before spending last season on loan at Empoli, consistently troubled the Palermo defence with his accurate passing.</p> <p>The performance was enough for the Tuttosport editor Paolo di Paola to declare the team \"in crisis\" on the pitch \u2013 as well as everywhere else \u2013 but, beyond getting rid of Ranieri, nobody seems to be offering any practical solutions. Ranieri started Sebastian Giovinco, another youth-team graduate, behind Del Piero and Amauri in a 4-3-1-2 formation yesterday after fans demanded he do so. In the end Giovinco, so impressive in midfield against Catania and Borisov, was simply bullied and subdued by Palermo's Fabio Liverani.</p> <p>The sad truth is that a section of fans seem to have been waiting for Ranieri to fail at Juventus from the word go. Even last season, as Juventus comfortably met the club president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli's demand to finish in the Champions League places, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/mar/10/europeanfootball.juventus\">many fans were grumbling about the team's failure to challenge for the title</a>, despite the fact the club had only just returned to the top flight from Serie B, having lost key players along the way. There is a perception that Ranieri has never won the biggest trophies, and therefore never will. He is not devious enough. Not hungry enough. Too nice.</p> <p>At root, though, Juventus are victims of their own past success. The club expects to compete for the biggest trophies but, much like Milan, has not adequately replaced its ageing or departed stars. Last season's run to third place was achieved in great part on the back of remarkable seasons from Del Piero and Trezeguet, who scored 21 and 20 goals to finish first and second in Serie A's scoring charts respectively. But the former is 33 and the latter 30 and out until December. Nedved remains pivotal at 36.</p> <p>Amauri was a shrewd signing and has done his best to pick up the slack up front, scoring three goals thus far, but he cannot do it alone. Other signings have failed to live up to billing. Sergio Almir\u00f3n cost \u20ac9m and is on loan at Fiorentina. Tiago Mendes cost \u20ac13m and simply won't leave. Sissoko has improved but even now is not always convincing. Youth-team players such as Giovinco and Marchisio have impressed and among fans there is an appetite to see them come good, but none of the patience required for the inevitable dips in form that young players have.</p> <p>Ranieri is not blameless for this failure to update the squad \u2013 he was given more say in the club's transfer campaign this summer \u2013 but neither should he be made to carry the can. Liverpool's Xabi Alonso was, alongside Amauri, his No1 target this summer, and there is little doubt that he would have offered the team a creativity and distribution from midfield that Christian Poulsen, the man they signed instead, simply does not possess.</p> <p>For now Cobolli Gigli has been supportive of Ranieri, stating after yesterday's game that he would stick behind his manager, and that \"any other reaction would be hysterical, destabilising in fact\". But the international week offers plenty of time for reflection. And, as we know in football, a vote of confidence from the president is often anything but.</p> <h2>Round six talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 After the excitement of last week's derby win, Milan came crashing down to earth with a goalless draw at Cagliari, who have scored only once all season and previously hadn't picked up a single point. The Italian press explained the setback by suggesting Milan have an allergy to the colours red and blue \u2013 also worn by Bologna and Genoa, the two teams who have beaten them in the league. Owner Silvio Berlusconi had another theory. \"This time I didn't choose the formation, like I usually do.\"<br>\u2022 Ranieri isn't the only leading manager coming under pressure lately \u2013 three years of sterling work by Luciano Spalletti at Roma are at risk of being undone by a miserable start that continued with a 1-0 defeat at Siena yesterday. They lie 14th and have yet to take a point away from home.

  "<p>The world needs an international agreement like the Kyoto protocol to reduce levels of ozone pollution which harm human health and crop yields, according to a report from senior scientists.</p> <p>In a report from the <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/\">Royal Society</a>, the scientists said that current regulatory approaches were failing and that the problem needed to be tackled at a UN level. Prof David Fowler who chaired the working group who produced the report said it was \"a major international issue\". </p> <p>\"The only way we are going to really solve the problem in the longer term is by having international strategies because it is a global pollutant,\" he said. \"If we don't take action now it could be a really serious problem.\"</p> <p>Ozone forms in the air from chemical reactions involving pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen (collectively known as NOX) and volatile organic compounds such as benzene. These are released when fossil fuels are burned in cars or power stations. The problem of ozone pollution at ground level is a separate from the issue of ozone holes in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Ozone is particularly dangerous for older people and people with asthma because it affects the lungs, nose and eyes. In 2003, an estimated 1,582 people died in the UK because of ozone exposure and this number is projected to rise 51% by 2020. Ozone can also reduce the yield and affect the nutritional quality of crops including wheat, rice and soybean. In the EU an estimated \u20ac6.7 bn was lost in 2000 due to impacts on arable crops. Ozone is also a greenhouse gas.</p> <p>Fowler said that the US and Europe had made great strides in reducing levels of the pollutants that lead to ozone production, but he said more needed to be done and other sources \u2013 such as developing economies and shipping \u2013 sould to be tackled. \"Europe and North America have each tried to solve their ozone problem as a local problem,\" said Fowler, \"but most of the ozone coming into Britain is coming from everywhere else on the planet.\"</p> <p>He said that controls on pollution from international shipping are too lax. By 2020, he said that more NOX is projected to enter Europe from burning fuel in ships' engines than from all land-based sources combined.</p> <p>\"The crucial thing is to have a control strategy that brings everyone into the same family,\" he said, \"There's time to do it and it is all doable and it is not a global disaster, but if you leave it the cost later will be very much greater, both in terms of human health and crops.\"</p>",
  "<p>First day back for parliament after the long summer recess and already the issue of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/terrorism\">42 days' detention without charge for terrorism suspects</a> is making headlines.<br><br>Downing Street today sought to play down reports in <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/\">the Times</a> that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> was preparing for a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4887653.ece\">\"humiliating climbdown\" over the proposal on 42 days</a>, which returns to the Lords this week.</p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman insisted: \"The prime minister's position on 42 days is very clear: the House of Commons has expressed its will very clearly back in June. The government believes that 42 days is the right proposal and the government will push ahead with legislation in the Lords.\"</p> <p>However, his comments did not address the assertion in the Times that ministers admit privately there is not \"a cat in hell's chance\" of the legislation being passed into law.</p> <p>Asked how confident the government was of getting the legislation through the Lords, he responded: \"It is not for the government to make predictions.\" </p> <p>Pressed repeatedly on whether the government would use the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/jul/02/hunting.immigrationpolicy1\">Parliament Act</a> to ensure the legislation makes it on to the statute and the will of the Commons prevails, the spokesman was equally unequivocal.</p> <p>\"We don't speculate on hypotheticals,\" came the reply. Downing Street code for: \"We don't want to be pinned down on that yet, thank you very much.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you're an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/30/why.the.music.world.needs.oasis\">Oasis</a> fan, you probably visited <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/\">MySpace</a> last week. The social networking site previewed the band's new album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/03/rockreview.oasis\">Dig Out Your Soul</a>, a week before its official release.</p> <p>If not, perhaps you used the site to listen to something else, from Bob Dylan to the White Stripes. MySpace has, so to speak, a track record in the music businesses, being credited with furthering the careers of acts such as Lily Allen, My Chemical Romance, and the Arctic Monkeys.</p> <p>Now MySpace has an even bigger ambition. Following the launch of <a href=\"http://music.myspace.com/\">MySpace Music</a> late last month, it is building what chief executive Chris DeWolfe calls \"the biggest internet music catalogue in the world\".</p> <p>To achieve this, the site has signed deals with all four major record labels \u2013 EMI, Sony BMG, Warner Music, and Universal \u2013 that will apparently give them shareholdings in the site.</p> <p>Users will be able to share playlists of up to 100 songs with friends on MySpace, instead of going to music sites such as Last.fm. MySpace will benefit by selling advertising and sponsorships. Backers include McDonald's and Toyota.</p> <p>The idea is that fans will go to MySpace Music not just for free songs but to buy albums, T-shirts, concert tickets and other merchandise. It's hoped they will also buy MP3 digital downloads, which are delivered from Amazon's music store. Unlike the tracks provided by Apple's iTunes, these are all unprotected MP3 files that will play on almost any device.</p> <p>While MySpace Music has only been launched in the US, the plan is to roll it out to other countries.</p> <p>MySpace, which is now owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has been able to do the deals it needs partly because the major labels resent Apple's control of the music download business. </p> <p>However, not everyone is pleased. The Washington Times, for example, pointed out <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/03/myspace-home-to-davids-sides-with-goliath\">that the \"home to Davids\" was now siding with the Goliaths</a>. It was the millions of unsigned bands, their fans, and the independent labels that made MySpace a force in the music business. Now the corporate giants are moving in, and some indies fear they may be pushed aside. </p> <p>On the other hand, MySpace probably feels the need to play to its strengths. It is one of the web's most popular destinations, along with sites such as Wikipedia and YouTube. It has more than 100 million users, but it is under increasing pressure from Facebook, a rival social networking site. </p> <p>MySpace and Facebook are, of course, dramatically different. MySpace home pages tend to be big, brightly coloured and jam packed with digital bling. They often include music and video streams.</p> <p>Facebook pages are more formal, far more sober, and most of them look much the same. MySpace tends to be hedonistic and leisure-oriented, while Facebook is more university and career oriented. Many users have, of course, signed up for both.</p> <p>But thanks to MySpace Music, users could spend more time at MySpace, and add shopping to their socialising. That's the plan.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour party conference saw announcements <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/jacqui_smith_speech,2008-09-21\">from the home secretary, Jacqui Smith</a>, and the minister for women and equality, <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/harriet_harman_closes_labour_party_conference\">Harriet Harman</a>, revealing that local authorities are to be given greater powers to regulate lap-dancing clubs. This followed news that, in contrast, delegates at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham received <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7615733.stm\">discount vouchers</a> for a local lap-dancing club. </p> <p>The government's announcement is to be welcomed. For four years the lap-dancing industry has enjoyed being subject to no more scrutiny than that given to cafes or karaoke bars. This has been the case since a loophole in the Licensing Act 2003 boxed lap-dancing clubs into a \"one size fits all\" licensing category primarily designed for the leisure industry. Yet, as Object's campaign <a href=\"http://www.object.org.uk\">Stripping the Illusion</a> highlights, lap-dancing clubs clearly have more in common with peep shows or sex cinemas \u2013 licensed as sex establishments \u2013 than with Starbucks. </p> <p>Wholly inadequate licensing has acted as a green light to the industry \u2013 which unsurprisingly has doubled in size since 2004. The ensuing mainstreaming of lap-dancing clubs, increasingly popular venues for <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=519\">corporate entertainment</a>, lads' nights out, and stag dos, has alarmed both organisations campaigning towards gender equality and those working on the frontline of violence against women. It has also led to wider debate: <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/the+hidden+world+of+lap+dancing/2483062\">tonight's episode of Dispatches</a> on Channel 4, for example, is investigating the increase in the number of lap-dancing clubs in Britain.</p> <p>In a society crawling to women's equality <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/projects/workingbetter/sexandpower/pages/variationsitedefault.aspx\">at a snail's pace</a>, where <a href=\"http://www.rapecrisis.org.uk/stats.html\">rape convictions</a> are the lowest for any crime, and where many <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16618\">women continue to be blamed</a> for sexual assault committed against them, something is clearly still wrong with our attitudes towards sex and relations between women and men. The spread in recent years of \"sex object culture\" \u2013 the sexualisation of women's and girl's bodies in the media and popular culture \u2013 in a way that has little parallel for boys or men, therefore needs urgent addressing. The dehumanisation of women into sex objects, not people, is a key attitude underpinning inequality and violence. The normalising of lap-dancing clubs fits squarely into this culture.</p> <p>So it is that an issue such as licensing can directly contribute to sexist attitudes running right through the centre of our society. Yet due to the Licensing Act 2003 loophole, the current licensing system views the social impact of lap-dancing clubs to be no greater than that of cafe bars. This has also led to a loss of democracy in licensing processes. Local communities wishing to have a say in licensing of lap-dancing clubs are confronted with processes that <a href=\"http://www.object.org.uk/downloads/A_Growing_Tide2008.pdf\">tie the hands of local authorities (pdf)</a> from acting on their concerns. </p> <p>The key question therefore is whether the government's promise to take action will see legislation introduced sooner rather than later. Object, lobbying alongside the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk\">Fawcett Society</a>, is calling for lap-dancing clubs to be licensed as Sex Encounter Establishments (SEEs) \u2013 venues that offer visual entertainment for sexual stimulation. This will untie the hands of local authorities by recognising, regulating and licencing lap-dancing clubs for what they are \u2013 part of the commercial sex industry. The measure is supported by a broad range of organisations, from Rape Crisis England and Wales and the White Ribbon Campaign to the <a href=\"http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=907107\">Local Government Association</a>. </p> <p>Object and the Fawcett Society are organising a <a href=\"http://www.object.org.uk/LapDancingGetInvolved.html\">public event</a> to spell out the need to translate these promising announcements into action. The time to act is now: closing the loophole will send out a powerful message that buying a lap dance has a far greater social impact than buying a cappuccino.</p>",
  "<p>So Jack may be buying a tropical uniform after all - he just won't be wearing it in Malawi. <br><br>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/aug/14/jackmcconnellshouldhestay\">this blog reported in mid-August</a>, at least one shrewd and well-connected political figure in Scotland had his doubts that McConnell would ever take up his post as high commissioner to Lilongwe.</p> <p>It didn't seem a widely accepted view; McConnell and Scottish Labour officials insisted his move to Malawi was never in doubt. But on Saturday, the former Scottish Labour leader and defeated first minister emerged as Gordon Brown's part-time plenipotentiary of peace while staying on as MSP for Motherwell. </p> <p>He will now become a special Foreign Office envoy on capacity-building in conflict-torn countries such as Kosovo and Rwanda \u2013 a \"serious job to deal with serious issues\" says McConnell. </p> <p>Until the 2011 Holyrood elections, that is. McConnell has carefully left this option open. Can we expect him to resign his seat then? I think we probably can. </p> <p>So Labour's defeat in the Glasgow East byelection in July has had several significant, even bloody, effects, all of which suggest that Gordon Brown's apparent disinterest in and complacency about his party's fortunes in Scotland is over. </p> <p><a href=\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7653253.stm\">Alex Salmond described McConnell's new role it as \"blatant political manipulation</a> in order to avoid defeat in a by-election\".</p> <p>The two men charged with holding Glasgow East \u2013 <a href=\"http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/parliament/0,,-6377,00.html\">David Cairns</a> and <a href=\"http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/parliament/0,,-4552,00.html\">Frank Roy</a> \u2013 have been knifed, one way or another. Their boss, Des Browne, was dumped as defence secretary on Friday, so then jumped altogether. </p> <p>Cairns resigned as Browne's deputy \u2013 his dignity intact and perhaps enhanced \u2013 after Downing Street insiders pushed him into it. </p> <p>Roy, a canny Labour whip and fixer, was originally touted as the coordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a> (expected on November 6), repeating his role in Glasgow East. No longer. That proposal has been comprehensively killed off and he went for a three-week break in the US instead. </p> <p>Roy's tactic of focusing heavily on mobilising the Labour vote in Glasgow is now disparaged. </p> <p>The Glenrothes campaign is now firmly in the hands of a close-knit team of Fifers, including rising stars such as John Park, a newly elected MSP and former trade unionist at one of the local Labour movement's power bases, Rosyth dockyard. </p> <p>The SNP spent the last year softening up the seat, knowing that John MacDougall was terminally ill. Labour has tried to counter that by stringing out the byelection date. In the seven weeks since MacDougall's funeral, Labour's machine has run an intense local campaign, with carefully placed anti-SNP stories in Fife's clutch of local papers, and exclusive interviews with the PM for local papers and radio stations. </p> <p>The resignation of Brownite special adviser Paul Sinclair as Downing Street's Scottish media spinner last month may not be as calamitous to Brown as it appears: Sinclair had fallen out with key people in Holyrood's press corps, so his effectiveness was in question. </p> <p>If this was not political enough, there is even a cabinet level post now dedicated to saving Brown's legacy, Scottish Labour and the union. Jim Murphy was made a full time secretary of state for Scotland last Friday.</p> <p>Murphy now has a \u00a37.8m budget and 55 staff at his disposal at the Scotland Office, and not much legislation to worry about. He was very keen on getting the post, and lobbied Brown for the role: he badly wants to be nat-basher-in-chief. </p> <p>No wonder the SNP are crying foul. Angus Robertson's, the SNP's leader in Westminster, remarked: \"The game is up for the Scotland Office \u2013 which is clearly just a publicly-funded campaigning vehicle for the Labour party.\" </p> <p>But these manoeuvres are probably the best compliment of all to the SNP; as we reported last week, Alex Salmond bemoaned Labour's ineptitude and the lack of a Mandelson figure to put up some decent opposition. It seems he got his wish. Big time. </p>",
  "<p>Not much chance of any bright spots amongst the gloom at the moment. Overnight Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - has jumped for the dollar, pound and euro, more evidence if it were needed of the continuing strains in the financial system.</p> <p>Investors are hoping that the government will come good with its weekend hints that it will do something dramatic to ease the funding crisis in the banking system.</p> <p>Most analysts are expecting the Bank of England to bite the bullet and cut interest rates on Thursday, but this will do little to unfreeze the credit markets. </p> <p>\"We believe that the Bank will cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday,\" said Amit Thakar of Seymour Pierce. \"This will be followed by a further 25bp cut in November.</p> <p>\"The Banks' action will have absolutely no impact on the economy or the markets.

Altium Securities has just issued a sell note.</p> <p>The broker said: \"The general tone in the [retail] sector remains negative and will not be helping JJB. </p> <p>\"The obvious risk in sticking to our negative stance is that the rumoured management buyout finally materialises.

  "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, 12 months is surely an eternity. A year ago Brown still bounced. Cameron was having to make the speech of his life to save his skin, facing what looked like an imminent general election likely to conclude in the Tories' fourth successive defeat. Today consistent Conservative poll leads have led many to write off Labour's chances for 2010 and view Cameron as a prime minister in waiting. And Comment is free is collecting blogs that address the question \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/whoownstheprogressivefuture\">Is the Future Conservative</a>\"?<br> If we're looking at one-word answers surely the reply must be a resounding \"no\". Admittedly now that it looks like they have a prospect of power, there seems to be more interest in Tory ideas than at any time since their long spell in opposition began. Labour thinktanks such as the IPPR have been selling their wares to the other side and veteran radical-left publishers Lawrence and Wishart, whose biggest grossing titles are Marx in the original, have just published a zeitgeisty e-book on <a href=\"http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/conservative.pdf\">new Conservative thinking (pdf)</a>. Yet if you put aside the admiration expressed for Thatcher to the Tory faithful by Cameron at their conference and consider what those ideas actually are emerging from his green papers, the answer is that there's nothing much that'd be out of place in the New Labour bible. For the time being the future consists of the Conservative party aping of New Labour. The postwar Butskellite consensus has been replaced by a post cold war/Berlin Wall/Thatcher consensus that Cameron and Brown both labour under.</p> <p>The few policies that have been unveiled in the past week are a confused ragbag. Wanting more regulation in the financial sector and rushing to Gordon Brown's side to fight the fires of global capitalism in crisis contradicts earlier positions the Conservatives have taken. Populism must inform Tory support for have-a-go-heroes (homeowners who kill burglars) and freezing council tax. But announcing an expansion of academy schools is surely an attempt to out-New Labour New Labour, in the same way that the \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" soundbite once whipped the law and order rug from under the Tories feet. The Conservatives' ostentatious halting of plans for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/29/toryconference.transport\">third runway at Heathrow</a> last week is ostensibly a radical green solution but its chief inspiration was the arc of marginal commuterbelt seats in the shadow of the flightpath. </p> <p>Elsewhere a rightwing moralism dictates the tax breaks for married couples that JK Rowling tore into when dispatching her million quid to Labour. Step back, though, and in terms of broader rhetoric there is bigger picture talk of \"corporate social responsibility\" and sticking to Labour's spending pledges. Substitute in the name of economist Richard Thayler (pioneer of the theory of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives1\">nudge theory</a>\") for Anthony Giddens or Will Hutton (Remember the \"third way\" and the \"state we're in\"?) and it all could all bring on an odd sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for anyone old enough to remember or care. </p> <p>For the moment the Tories are too timid to upset New Labour's thrice election-winning formula of public service investment with an acceptance of the framework of market economics. Hence we are solemnly warned there will be no Tory tax cuts. Indeed he 10p debacle shows how pass\u00e9 slashing taxes is. Even while the majority were 2p in the pound better off, widespread outrage caused a government climbdown that couldn't save the Crewe and Nantwich seat. Amid Cameron's Thatcher namedropping the BBC counted the use of the word \"society\" 23 times in his main conference speech \u2013 something Lady T famously thought there was no such thing as.</p> <p>David Cameron's self-portrayal as blokey Smiths fan who suns it on the beach in Cornwall with his young family while preferring exclusive foreign <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/23/exclusive-lavish-holiday-exposes-the-lie-of-ordinary-guy-david-cameron-115875-20708731/\">hols on the sly</a> is living proof of the success of New Labour: a plastic Blair. Ditto Nick Clegg. When I interviewed amiable Dagenham backbencher <a href=\"http://www.labourhome.org/story/2007/11/20/84423/521\">Jon Cruddas</a> he called all this \"cross-dressing\" and commented: \"It's almost physiologically they're all merging into one.\" All around us the evidence is there: it is New Labour who has won the battle of ideas and the Conservatives who have surrendered to the dictum that \"if you can't beat 'em join 'em\" or rather, ape them. In the 18 months that remain until the next election the Labour party must convince the British public of the hollowness of Cameron's con trick.</p> <p><em>Is the future Conservative?, a debate by Comment is free and Soundings magazine, will take place in London at Kings Place on October 6 at 7pm.

  "<p>The shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes was down to \"terrible and extraordinary circumstances\" and was not a result of wrongdoing by officers, the senior policewoman in charge of the operation told an inquest today. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338316010\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/12/21/cdp.jpg\" alt=\"The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Cressida Dick \" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick. Photograph: Andrew Stuart/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Stuart/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick was in the Scotland Yard control room during the pursuit of the innocent Brazilian electrician.</p> <p>De Menezes, 27, was shot seven times in the head at Stockwell tube station in south London on July 22 2005 by police marksmen after being mistaken for the terrorist Hussain Osman, who was on the run.</p> <p>Jean Charles's mother, Maria Otone de Menezes, attended the inquest at the Oval cricket ground for the first time today to hear Dick's evidence.</p> <p>Asked what went wrong, Dick said: \"One thing that clearly went wrong was that we as a nation did not manage to prevent those attacks on July 7 or indeed Hussain Osman and others' attacks on the 21st.</p> <p>\"Mr De Menezes was the victim of some terrible and extraordinary circumstances the day afterwards.\"</p> <p>She said the electrician had been \"unfortunate\" to live in the same block as the terrorist, to look \"very like Hussain Osman\" and to have entered the same tube station that three of the bombers had entered the day before.</p> <p>Other factors she said contributed to the \"awful tragedy\" were the fact that the first surveillance officer had been \"indisposed\" and that the Brazilian only waited at the bus stop for a short time, leaving little time \"to look at him properly\".</p> <p>Dick said that De Menezes \"in all innocence - the way he behaved, the way he came off the bus and on the bus - contributed to my assessment of him as a bomber from the day before, and someone who might be intent on causing an explosion today\".</p> <p>The inquest heard that on the morning of the shooting Dick went to the wrong room and missed the start of an important meeting of senior officers to discuss strategy. </p> <p>She said that when she arrived at the 7am meeting 15 minutes late she did not recall everyone being present. \"I had the feeling that it might have been going on for some time before I was there.\"</p> <p>Dick told the inquest she was Scotland Yard's most experienced commander of high-risk firearms operations in the years before De Menezes's shooting and was called into action \"literally on a daily basis\".</p>",
  "<p>A senior brigadier's candour about the prospects of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/afghanistan\"> beating the Taliban</a> in Afghanistan must have given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/johnhutton.gordonbrown\">new defence secretary</a> John Hutton a bit of jolt just days into his new job. But he should welcome the remarks of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4887927.ece\">Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith</a> about British strategy as a cue for a reality check.</p> <p>It isn't the only urgent problem in the new minister's in-tray. In fact, it is one of several that will need addressing sooner rather than later \u2013 and by that I mean in the next few weeks. It isn't that his predecessor, Des Browne, didn't care. He is said to have been privately anguished by the level of deaths and injuries of British servicemen and women in a conflict in which they have been involved over a longer period than the second world war.</p> <p>The problem is that both Browne and his prime minister avoided public pronouncements about the aim of British strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan, what it might realistically achieve and when the troops could come home.</p> <p>The problems now facing Hutton are that British forces and their equipment are facing exhaustion after five-and-a-half years in Iraq and seven in Afghanistan. Though most of the troops will come out of Iraq next summer, they will do so with little sense of success and with the opprobrium of the Americans, the ally whose cause took them there in the first place.</p> <p>The British division will pull out of Basra by midsummer, to be replaced by a US divisional command. In theory this should save between \u00a3500m and \u00a3750m from the UK budget. But it probably won't. Replacing their kit, training and redeployment \u2013 most likely to Afghanistan \u2013 will eat up a large slice of that saving.</p> <p>In Afghanistan the dilemma is different, more dangerous and complex. There are now signs of a serious difference in approach between Britain and America. Increasingly the international effort in Afghanistan is becoming an all-American run show. The American commander <a href=\"http://www.nationalpost.com/news/world/story.html?id=859844\">General David McKiernan</a> commands the international support and assistance force to the Karzai government (Isaf) as well as commanding the US operation enduring freedom against al-Qaida and its allies in George W Bush's global \"war on terror\" (GWOT). He is running a split command, and different missions.</p> <p>\"Increasingly the allies, even the ones doing the fighting like the Canadians, Dutch, Danes and Brits are becoming bit players \u2013 a sideshow,\" a British commander told me recently. \"This is now an American mission.\" </p> <p>The new American commander for US forces across the region, General David Petraeus, believes he can use the same tactics he has just employed in Iraq. He wants there now to be a <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/01/mideast/military.php\">surge of allied forces</a> into Afghanistan in the way he believes that the surge of 35,000 extra American forces into Iraq have turned round security there \u2013 though some say the picture isn't as <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4887371.ece?openComment=true\">simple as that</a>. He is preparing to dispatch a further 15,000 US forces to Kabul by the spring. On his visit to London last week he was evidently seeking the UK government to match this by sending the bulk of the forces being pulled out of Iraq next year of around 3,500 to Afghanistan.</p> <p>The most Britain can send now is a few hundred extra specialists, engineers, signalers, logisticians and the like. There is an unspoken reluctance to commit further because of misgivings about the American approach to spreading the war into Pakistan and because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/military.defence\">British defence budget</a> is bust \u2013 or even worse than bust. In July, Bush signed an unpublished operational order authorising American ground forces as well as drones and aircraft to raid into Taliban and al-Qaida sanctuary zones <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/washington/11policy.html?hp\">inside Pakistan</a>. </p> <p>Now there is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/world/asia/03pstan.html?partner=rssyahoo&amp;emc=rss\">full-scale war</a> across the North-West Frontier Province, the Federally Administered Tribal Area (Fata) and hitherto peaceful districts like Swat. According to New York Times reports this weekend, hundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing \u2013 some so desperate that they are seeking safety inside Afghanistan \u2013 as the Pakistan army takes on Taliban affiliates. The Americans believe that the al-Qaida command of Osama bin Laden is hiding in the remoter parts of Fata.</p> <p>However, al-Qaida seems to be resurgent and particularly active with a new offensive by its allies in Kashmir. Critics say that the American raids in Afghanistan and in the border areas are rapidly alienating the uncommitted in the population. The international command in Kabul has estimated that international forces may have killed up to 4,500 non-combatant civilians this year already. \"This means they may occasionally be able to win over the minds of the tribal communities temporarily, with schemes and subsidies,\" a former SAS commander told me this summer. \"But I think we've lost their hearts.\"</p> <p>The signs are, too, that despite American and Pakistani efforts, the terrorist campaigns of Taliban and al-Qaida are spreading deep into Pakistan \u2013 witness the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad and bombings in India. There is also <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqDiypxY7Yct2qAR7kX9FKk_j3pA\">rising tension</a> between India and Pakistan \u2013 and some fear another Indian-Pakistan standoff, or even conflict, is on the horizon. This time both parties have nuclear weapons. </p> <p>The spread of conflict is becoming so complex that it is unlikely the present American strategy and concept of operations can stop things getting much worse, and soon. This is the real fear of commanders like Carleton-Smith and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/afghanistan.usforeignpolicy\">British ambassador to Kabul</a>, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, in his private warning to his French colleague that present strategies are \"doomed to failure\".</p> <p>For British ministers like Hutton, the picture is made darker still by the disastrous state of defence finances. Equipment programmes that should run at an average of \u00a316bn over the next 10 years are now expected to soar to more than double that at \u00a335bn. There are problems with big-ticket items such as the new Nimrod surveillance plane and the recently installed Bowman communications system (at \u00a32.2bn) that cannot meet today's requirements for battlefield and strategic communications. The extra \u00a33bn for the Astute submarine programme for this year and the next has already been blown, according to defence industry sources and more funds will be required to get the programme up and running fully. Some in-house MoD analysts and critics are warning that Britain cannot afford to run all three armed services at their present premier division level \u2013 some even say that the navy may have to choose between running aircraft carriers and submarines.</p> <p>\"Things are really about to implode,\" a senior MoD advisers said privately this last week. Gordon Brown had hoped that he could put off a proper defence and security review until after the next election. Now he and his new defence secretary may find they are forced to carry one out very soon. It cannot be the usual \"carry on chaps\" approach of so many recent policy utterances from MoD in recent years.</p> <p>This time it will have to assess what Britain really needs and can really do for its own security \u2013 and that doesn't necessarily mean treating America as the senior partner at all turns.</p> <p>This time the review will have to be properly costed \u2013 which the last one, in 1998, was not. For it to have any realistic and lasting value it will also have to examine what we have learned from our mistakes and shortcomings since we went piling into Afghanistan and then Iraq since 2001. It is too late for protecting tender egos: a grown-up inquest into the Afghan and Iraq campaigns may avert even worse disasters ahead.</p>",

  "<p>You could imagine Mick McCarthy's team-talk on Saturday: with key players out and the team coming off a heavy midweek loss he'd have wanted his players to make sure they didn't concede an early goal. They were 1-0 down within 26 seconds and went on to lose to Swansea 3-1. McCarthy \u2013 correctly given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/swansea\">Swansea</a>'s home form and the absence of Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, Michael Kightly and Chris Iwelumo \u2013 refuses to panic. </p> <p>\"I'd rather be top than second but we can't complain. We have 22 points from 10 games,\" said McCarthy. \"If that's a crisis, then roll on the next crisis.\"</p> <p>Besides, too much criticism of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wolves\">Wolves</a> takes away from what was a good performance by Swansea, who have been by far the best of the promoted sides and are still undefeated at the Liberty Stadium. </p> <p>\u2022 Wolves were replaced at the top of the table by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/birminghamcityfc\">Birmingham City</a>, who ground out the dullest of 1-0 victories over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/qpr\">QPR</a>. Despite the club's lofty position there's still a fair amount of discontent at St Andrew's, with attendances low and David Sullivan complaining about the lack of atmosphere at home games. Depressingly for Blues fans, it's almost exactly the same situation as last time Blues were in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a>, with good league form countered by small crowds and Sullivan threatening to sell (although some fans wouldn't see that as a negative).</p> <p>Despite his adult-orientated background, Sullivan has done much to modernise a traditionally unstable club. However, some \u2013 OK, most - of the football Blues have played this season has been ultra-cautious, which has been particularly disappointing given the way they went down with a bit of verve at the end of last season. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/reading\">Reading</a>, on the other hand, continue to take on opponents with a ferocity bordering on the psychotic. They'd scored 17 goals in their five previous games at the Madejski and continued that form as they beat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/burnley\">Burnley</a> 3-1, a result that raised them to third in the table. There seems to be a determination to prove that last season was an aberration. Stephen Hunt, who has been relentless, embodies that appetite, something that Steve Coppell noted on Saturday: \"He plays flat out in an old-fashioned way, and the fans love that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 At the other end of table, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barnsley\">Barnsley</a> have been suffering from the season after the FA Cup semi-final before. After 49 minutes they were 1-0 down to fellow strugglers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/doncaster\">Doncaster</a>, Darren Moore had been sent off and cries of \"Davey out\" had begun to float around Oakwell. Amazingly they came back to win 4-1 (thanks in no small part to one of the goals of the season from Jamal Campbell-Ryce). If only Juande Ramos could get his players to fight like that.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/southampton\">Southampton</a> had put together a few decent results recently, and Jan Poortvliet's side must have been fairly confident ahead of their trip to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/coventry\">Coventry</a>. They started well and continue to play some pretty football, but their defending was conspicuous in its absence as Coventry won 4-1. Saints, by the way, were on the end of one of the worst penalty decisions of all time, which was followed up by one of the worst penalties of all time as Elliot Ward passed the ball into the grateful arms of Kelvin Davis. </p> <p>\u2022 While <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leicestercity\">Leicester</a> fans can hardly be enjoying life residing in the lower divisions, they're now three points clear at the top of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leagueonefootball\">League One</a>. More importantly the next five sides in the division all failed to win at the weekend. </p> <p>\u2022 In the performance of the week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mkdons\">MK Dons</a> thrashed one of those sides, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/millwall\">Millwall</a>, 4-0. It was a particularly impressive result considering Millwall's recent record had read P5 W5. Roberto Di Matteo's side now sit just two points off the play-offs. </p> <p>\u2022 There were three 3-3 draws in the Football League this weekend. On Friday night <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/swindon\">Swindon</a> found themselves 3-0 up at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hartlepool\">Hartlepool</a> thanks to a Simon Cox hat-trick, before Joel Porter scored a hat-trick of his own, the final goal coming in injury time. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bury\">Bury</a>'s capitulation/<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aldershot\">Aldershot</a>'s comeback was even more impressive. Bury were 3-0 up with less than half-an-hour to go before a 10-minute blitz from Aldershot levelled the game. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cheltenham\">Cheltenham</a>, meanwhile, came back three times against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/brightonfootball\">Brighton</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Congratulations to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rotherham\">Rotherham</a>, who now have the grand total of one point after their victory at the weekend: pretty impressive given that they started the season on \u201317 after entering administration. By my (very rough) calculations they'd be fourth in the table without the points penalty. The Millers' victims on Saturday were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/grimsby\">Grimsby</a>, the only team in the Football League without a win. These are extremely worrying times for Mariners fans: their team would be bottom of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leaguetwofootball\">League Two</a> if it wasn't for the penalties imposed on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luton\">Luton</a>, Rotherham and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bournemouth\">Bournemouth</a> and you wouldn't bet against the latter two catching them before the year is out. </p> <p>\u2022 For quote of the week, we return to Reading. The pastry lover's fantasy of choice, Nigella Lawson, revealed her husband had dreamed she was having an affair with Coppell. \"The sad thing was that she never actually thought it, it was him,\" sighed Coppell on Saturday. \"He wished it on her - I think she must have pissed him off big time.\" Lawson was equally damning: \"I said to my husband, 'Thanks a lot. You might have made it Mourinho.\"'</p>",

  "<p>\"As a nation we have no literature,\" the literary critic Belinsky cries in despair in part one of Tom Stoppard's play <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2190519.stm\">The Coast of Utopia</a>, lamenting the influence of European on Russian writers, and stressing the importance of creating a national story of their own. </p> <p>With storytelling comes a sense of identity. But national literatures evolve in stages, and the need for a literature of one's own changes according to the political situation of the nation in question. A new nation, or a nation struggling to declare its independence, will be driven to create something that is theirs, a literature that tells their national story. But the flux of modern history makes this a more or less impossible task.</p> <p>\"The universal idea speaks through humanity itself, and differently through each nation in each stage of its history,\" Belinsky says, later in the same speech. The need for a national literature changes according to the moment the nation is experiencing, and Stoppard catches this exactly - on one hand the ardent yearning for one, and on the other, the contingency of the literature on the historical moment. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.festival-america.com/Rencontres.htm\">Festival America</a> in Paris last weekend, the question of a writer's nationality and ethnic identity preoccupied most of the discussions. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the Nigerian-born author of Half of a Yellow Sun, argued for the Nigerian literature to be taught in Nigerian schools. \"It's a paradox,\" she said. \"People can be considered educated while knowing nothing about our history. [They] read English books, not Nigerian books! What this means is we really don't have a sense of our own history.\" Such history, she said, could not be written by outsiders. \"The stories of Africa should be written by Africans,\" she declared.</p> <p>But not all ethnic groups feel the need to speak of their immediate experiences. Some experiences need telling, while others are too embarrassing or shameful to recount. In a panel on writers and European heritage, <a href=\"http://www.peterbehrens.org/\">Peter Behrens</a>, whose novel The Law of Dreams is about Irish immigrants to Montreal during the Famine, spoke of families so shamed by their poverty and their foreignness that they could not write their stories for several generations. He compared this to the experience of Central American immigrants to Los Angeles, mentioning a Guatemalan woman he saw selling oranges by the roadside. \"Her kids aren't going to be interested in writing about that,\" he said. \"It's going to take a few generations before that will become worthy of storytelling. We want to let things sink into a kind of myth, before we confront them.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.namleonline.com/\">Nam Le</a>'s debut collection of stories The Boat, meanwhile, probes the place of ethnicity in a writer's work once nationality has become an unstable concept. The opening story in the collection, Love and Honor and Pity and Pride and Compassion and Sacrifice, captures a young writer's ambivalence about writing the \"ethnic stories\" his creative writing tutor in America tells him are \"hot\" and \"relevant\". The final story, The Boat, is by contrast a heart-seizing narrative of Vietnamese refugees on a perilous journey to Malaysia. </p> <p>Le, who was born in Vietnam and raised in Australia, eventually elected simply to write about what he thought was important. \"Today, no matter what or where I write about, I feel a responsibility to the subject matter,\" he said in an interview with his US publisher. \"Not so much to get it right as to do it justice.\" The places Le evokes in his stories - all over the globe, from New York to Tehran to Medell\u00edn to Hiroshima - are vividly realised, attesting less to the importance of a writer's ethnic identity than to the power of imagination.</p> <p>In many cases, it is no longer a question of discussing \"pure\" national literatures. France and England, notably, have had to come to terms with their colonial past on a literary level as well as a political one. However, each country's response to these new influences can, perhaps, be taken as an indication of the health of that nation. English literature, which stretched through from Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Sterne, Eliot, and Woolf, now extends to Naipaul, Rushdie, and Smith. In France, on the other hand, there is a real resistance to absorb the influences of Francophone writers, in order to \"preserve\" the French literary tradition. France was glad to accept the Nobel prize for Gao Xingjian, but a writer like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/apr/23/fiction.features1\">Fa\u00efza Gu\u00e8ne</a> still struggles for recognition by the St-Germain-centric literary scene. </p> <p>Finally, the greater movement between countries facilitated by the EU, as well as the effects of globalisation, further complicates the concept of a national literature. Behrens mentioned, for example, the recent influx of Polish immigrants to Ireland. \"Maybe soon someone will write the Great Novel of Irish-Polish Experience,\" he said, wryly.</p>",
  "<p>Effective communication and a credible regulator are needed if Uganda's Prosperity for All scheme to improve the financial muscle of rural areas is to be successful, the Daily Monitor reported last week. </p> <p>Commenting on the <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/opinions/Rethink_the_cash_strategy_for_fighting_poverty_72493.shtml\">Bonna Bagaggawale</a></strong> scheme, Dr Pascal Odoch, one of the Monitor's \"panel of experts\", said one of its weaknesses was the fact that it was \"anchored on a weak financial pivot\" \u2013 the Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisations (SACCOs), which are not ready to take on the challenge of managing the scheme.</p> <p>\"The numerous SACCOs that have mushroomed all over the country and keep shouting that \"they are ready\" for general Salim Saleh's [microfinance minister] micro-finance interventions, are themselves plagued with institutional challenges,\" Odoch wrote.</p> <p>He added that these organisations needed a regulator, as many of their managers are not qualified for the job. The regulator would ensure SACCOs employed experienced managers.</p> <p>Information about the scheme also needs to be effectively communicated to the six homesteads per parish that are involved.</p> <p>The Prosperity for All scheme, launched in October last year, aims to give people living in rural areas a place to save and borrow money to encourage enterprise.</p> <p>Last month, Barclays announced it was to <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/sep/26/livelihoods.news\">invest \u00a310m</a></strong> over three years in community finance schemes in developing countries, including Uganda.</p> <h2>President makes HIV/Aids promise</h2> <p>The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, this week made a recommitment <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Museveni_recommits_to_fight_HIV_Aids_72524.shtml\">to fight HIV and Aids</a></strong>, as the country's infection rates begin to rise.</p> <p>The Daily Monitor reported this week that Museveni wanted to focus on tackling mother to child transmissions.</p> <p>Speaking at the opening of the 1m Ugandan shillings Baylor College of Medicine-Children's Clinical Centre of Excellence at Mulago Hospital, the president said: \"It is important that all pregnant women test and if found with HIV they are given treatment to prevent mother to child transmission.\"</p> <p>According to the Monitor, 25,000 children are born with HIV each year.</p> <p>Uganda has been hailed as a success story for cutting HIV and Aids rates. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of infections fell from around 18% among the general population and 30% among pregnant women to around 5%, but rates are starting to edge up. Museveni blamed this on the Uganda Aids Commission, which he said had become lax in its duties.</p> <p>Free antiretroviral drugs have been available in Uganda since 2004 and some believe this has led to complacency.</p> <p>Others believe the president's move away from an ABC (abstinence, be faithful, use a condom) approach to sex education to a pro-abstinence campaign championed by the US has diluted the safe sex message.</p> <h2>Government curbs aid to LRA</h2> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/lra\">Lord's Resistance Army</a></strong> last week criticised the Ugandan government for encouraging aid agencies to stop providing rebels with food in a bid to force them to sign a peace deal.</p> <p>The minister for disaster preparedness, Prof Tarsis Kabwegyere, told a conference on cluster bombs in Kampala that denying the rebels food could pressurise them to sign the long awaited deal that would end more than 20 years of fighting in the north of the country.</p> <p>The LRA is refusing to sign a deal until arrest warrants issued for some of its leaders, including Joseph Kony, by the International Criminal Court, are withdrawn.</p> <p>The LRA peace delegation chairman, David Nyekorach Matsanga, said Kabwegyere's remarks did not help the peace process and added that the group was capable of feeding itself.</p> <h2>US ban on contraception</h2> <p>Family planning programmes in at least six African countries, including Uganda, face \"serious\" disruption following a decision by theUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) to ban Marie Stopes International (MSI) from receiving US-funded contraception.</p> <p>USAID has instructed staff to force African governments to discontinue the provision of contraception to Marie Stopes, one of the world's leading family planning organisations, because it works with the Chinese government, which the US accuses of \"coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisations\".<br> Marie Stopes chief executive Dana Hovig said the organisation did not support coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China or elsewhere. \"To the contrary, MSI is one of the few organisations that has worked over the past decade to increase the availability of voluntary, client-centred family planning services in China,\" said Hovig, who called the USAID decision as \"purely political and dangerous to the lives of women\". Hovig said the USAID instruction will \"seriously disrupt\" MSI's family planning programmes in at least six African states, including Ghana, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In one country, the organisation delivers 25% of all family planning services nationally.</p> <p>Hovig added: \"This senseless decision is likely to have only one clear consequence: the death of African women and girls. And the Bush Administration should answer for that.\" <br> Under US law, the government is not allowed to give aid to any organisation that, according to the president, \"supports or participates in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation\".</p> <p>USAID said it would do all it could to ensure other groups within the affected countries distributed contraceptives.</p> <h2>Programme to empower women</h2> <p>Women in five African countries are expected to benefit from an $8m United Nations programme to <strong><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/katine/empowerment \">empower</a></strong> women.</p> <p>The three-year Gender Equitable Local Development programme seeks to give women more access to resources and services at local level through gender-responsive planning and budgeting, and to encourage more women and community involvement in decision-making.</p> <p>The initiative will be rolled out in local governments in Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Tanzania.</p> <p>\"This programme aims to achieve concrete improvement in women's local realities,\" said the executive director of the UN Development Fund for Women, In\u00e9s Alberdi.</p> <p>\"It not only seeks to ensure local governments' accountability to secure women's equitable access to public services and productive assets, but also acknowledges women's agency in shaping decision-making around local plans and budgets.\"</p>",
  "<p>With a month to go before election day, the McCain campaign took a sharp turn towards the negative over the weekend - and Sarah Palin was in the vanguard. </p> <p>At three different events in California on Saturday, Palin attacked Obama's associations with Bill Ayers, the former Weather Underground member, accusing the Democratic candidate of \"palling around with terrorists\".</p> <p>The attacks drew a sharp response from Obama, who made much of a remark by a McCain adviser, published in the Washington Post, that his campaign was \"looking forward to turning the page on this financial crisis\". </p> <p>\"They plan to - and I quote - 'turn the page' on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swift Boat-style attacks on me,\" Obama told a crowd in North Carolina, in a speech backed up by a new TV ad. \"We are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and John McCain wants us to 'turn the page' on talking about the economy?\"</p> <p>Democratic surrogates also said the Obama campaign had given them the go-ahead to start mentioning some of McCain's questionable associations, including his involvement in the Keating Five scandal and his connections to the ultraconservative Council for World Freedom.</p> <p>The new negativity from the McCain campaign is a response to continuing bad news for the Republicans in the opinion polls: a New York Times analysis at the weekend noted that Obama is now seriously competitive in nine states that voted for Bush in 2004, while McCain is competitive in only four that voted for Kerry.</p> <p>Obama's associations with Ayers hardly justify the phrase \"palling around\": they served on a charity board together, and Ayers once hosted a political event for Obama early in his career. And Obama has repudiated Ayers's 1960s radicalism. But the question that seems likely to be most pressing in the coming week is not whether the Palin-led attacks are fair: it's whether they will work.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama has no public events scheduled for today. Joe Biden has cancelled his appearances for Monday and Tuesday after the death of his mother-in-law on Sunday. McCain is campaigning in New Mexico and Tennessee; Palin is in Florida. </p> <p>Tomorrow night, Obama and McCain will return to the limelight, nudging Palin aside, as they appear for the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, in a \"town hall meeting\", taking questions from the audience. It's McCain's favourite format.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's latest daily tracking poll, released yesterday, gave Obama a seven-point lead, at 50%, over McCain's 43%. It was the ninth straight day that the Democrat had had a statistically significant lead. An amusing Rasmussen poll, meanwhile, exposes the depth of the country's annoyance with its Congressmen and women in the wake of the bail-out law passed on Friday: fully 59% of voters, the poll found, would eject the entire Congress if they could.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Our opponent ... is someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect, imperfect enough, that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country ... This is not a man who sees America as you see America and as I see America\": Sarah Palin all but calls Obama a foreigner and a traitor - and not, one suspects, for the last time.</p> <h2>Spoof of the day</h2> <p>Tina Fey excels again on <a href=\" http://www.nbc.com/Saturday\\_Night\\_Live/video/clips/vp-debate-open-palin-biden/727421/\">Saturday Night Live</a>, in a spoof of last Thursday's debate.

  "<p>Today's <strong>Independent</strong> launched a 24-page sports section but ditched its stand-alone media supplement. Some people are bound to see this as confirmation that the editor,<strong> Roger Alton</strong>, is a great sports fan. But it's obvious that sport is a bigger draw for readers than media pages. </p> <p>Advertisers for sports sections, however, are almost impossible to attract. Media buyers refuse to see the value in placing ads on some of the best-read pages of newspapers. The belief is that men who consume sport do not to consume much else. So there is just one paid-for advert in the new Indy section. </p> <p>It's a pacey, colourful section with a terrific poster picture on its spread, but devoid of lengthy analytical reads. I liked the <strong>Brian Viner</strong> interview with Aston Villa's <strong>Ashley Young</strong>, especially the anecdote about receiving a call from the former England manager, <strong>Steve McLaren</strong>. Overall, a good opening goal or Alton.</p> <p>The movement of the media section into the main paper has not noticeably diminished its coverage of the topic despite it getting less space. There are seven busy pages at the back of the book, following business. <strong>Matthew Norman's</strong> diary remains, as do the columns, on the press by <strong>Stephen Glover</strong>, and on advertising by <strong>Claire Beale</strong>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/will-the-internet-survive-the-economic-meltdown-952287.html\">main feature</a>, by former <strong>Press Gazette</strong> editor <strong>Ian Reeves</strong>, looks at the possibility of the internet suffering another economic crash, based in part on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/01/slybailey.trinitymirror\">last week's speech</a> by <strong>Trinity Mirror's</strong> ceo, <strong>Sly Bailey</strong>, about a coming \"digital slump\". The final two-thirds of his article quotes people who believe it isn't going to happen... maybe.</p> <p>The Indy's ditching of its media section was prefigured in yesterday's first full-colour issue of the <strong>Independent on Sunday</strong>, which reduced its media coverage to a single page. </p> <p>There has been a pronounced retreat from media coverage by the national press in the last couple of years. The <strong>Telegraph</strong> titles do very little nowadays, if any. <strong>The Times</strong> carries a regular, and readable, media business column by <strong>Dan Sabbagh</strong>, but not much else. The days of the <strong>Sunday Times's</strong> newspaper column, by <strong>Brian MacArthur</strong>, are long distant.</p> <p>The <strong>Financial Times</strong> sticks, as you would expect, to the business end. None of the middle-market daily or Sunday papers bother with coherent media coverage, nor do the red-tops. (For the <strong>Daily Mail </strong>and <strong>The Sun</strong>, media coverage means taking lumps out of the <strong>BBC</strong> at every opportunity).</p> <p>The Indy clearly has not given up on media, because seven pages out of 48 shows continuing commitment. But it never did manage to lure advertisers away from <strong>The Guardian's</strong> media section, the first of its kind and still going strong despite the noticeable down-turn in media advertising, so its supplement was an on-cost with, presumably, too little audience appreciation. </p> <p>Yet \"the media\" is a part of modern life that deserves to be monitored consistently. Its influence appears to grow rather than diminish. There needs to be public scrutiny of the people who own and control the various media platforms and of those who manage and operate it on behalf of those owners and controllers.</p> <p>Despite its scant resources, The Independent has played, and is playing, a part in keeping the media honest. Why do so many other serious papers ignore it, I wonder?</p>",
  "<p>The (de)merits of believing what you read about Hollywood in the UK tabloids have been discussed ad nauseam. However, the Sun's report today that Kate Winslet is to play Vivienne Westwood in a new biopic looks bona fide enough: the newspaper's story features confirmation from a spokeswoman for the fashion designer. This rumour was all over the place following whispers at Paris fashion week, but as there are no other details of cast, crew or director we can only assume that the movie is in the very early stages of being put together, although <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/06/fashion\">Hadley Freeman already has a few thoughts on what happens when fashion collides with Hollywood</a>.</p> <p>Much more definite is <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081006/en_afp/entertainmentusfilmspielberg\">Steven Spielberg's split with Paramount</a>, which was officially confirmed today. As previously reported, the Oscar-winning film-maker is to form a new Hollywood-based film venture worth $1.5bn with India's Reliance ADA Group. But never fear, Spielberg apparently retains a good working relationship with his long-time partners in DreamWorks and will continue to produce films in the Transformers franchise. Phew. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Empire reports that <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=23369\">the Stoker clan have sold the film rights to the forthcoming officially approved sequel to Dracula</a> (that's the 1897 novel by Bram). The new book has been written by the latter's great-grandnephew Dacre Stoker, apparently in accordance with notes left by his illustrious ancestor for a second book. Dacre has also had help from award-winning Dracula documentarian and historian Ian Holt, and the title, Dracula: the Undead, also originated with Bram. So it's all as official as official can be. Holt has also written a screenplay with Alexander Galant, and the film should start shooting in June 2009. Speed director Jan de Bont is producing. </p> <p>Finally, Michael Douglas <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7654062.stm\">will be presented with the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement award</a> at a tribute event in Los Angeles in June. Fittingly, it's the same award his father took home in 1991. Douglas hasn't been seen much on our screens recently, following 2007's King of California. But he has four films on his slate, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/11/stevensoderbergh\">a biopic of Liberace</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/17/2\">a film in which he'll play a sex addict</a>, so with a bit of luck the award won't mark the end of an admirably edgy career.</p>",
  "<p>MPs returning to parliament today will find their change includes anti-tuition fee pound coins that campaigners have put into circulation in Westminster.</p> <p>More than 9,000 coins bearing the motto Free For All are being circulated in the House of Commons to highlight the cost of fees paid by undergraduates for higher education, as students head back to university.</p> <p>The stunt by the UK Youth Parliament is part of its campaign to abolish <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/06/studentfinance.choosingadegree\">tuition fees</a>, which now stand at \u00a33,145 per year at universities in England.</p> <p>James Greenhalgh, MYP and national campaigns coordinator, said: \"There seems to be no end in sight as the cost of university spirals out of control. </p> <p>\"Young people are being asked to play Russian roulette with their financial future as they incur mounting debts.</p> <p>\"Education should be free for all young people and we will not stop until the injustices this flawed tuition fees system have created are brought to an end.\"</p> <p>He said of the campaign: \"The coins are to highlight awareness of the issue to those in government and people all around the country to get as many people as possible to see the coins and take a look at the <a href=\"\">website</a>.</p> <p>\"We want to get people talking about the issue of university tuition fees.\"</p> <p>The UKYP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/jul/18/whyyouthparliamentwantstui\">launched the campaign</a> over the summer.</p> <p>Its policy sits at odds with the National Union of Students, which is looking to change the way tuition fees work but accepts that graduates have to make some contribution to their higher education.</p>",
  "<p>This week on The X Factor the judges chose the final 12. There were winners and there were losers, but did you agree with the final choices? <br></p> <p>By Sunday night, each judge had chosen their final three \u2013 and I'm sure a few of you were screaming at the TV: \"How could they put that act through?\" </p> <p>It was apparent, more than ever, that in the battle between genuine talent and perceived likeability, talent sometimes lost. And the females had a much tougher ride than the males.</p> <p>In Dannii's over-25's category, I would argue that background story won over talent. I could see why Dannii made her tactical choices as I imagine she didn't want to put through three women \u2013 even though Suzie Furlong, Rachel Hylton and Ruth Lorenzo were the strongest singers. Choosing between <strong>Daniel Evans</strong> and James Williams, she chose the weaker singer who had the bigger sympathy factor. I feel terrible saying it, but I think having lost his wife was what put Daniel through. </p> <p><strong>Rachel Hylton</strong> has a great voice, with a unique sound and character \u2013 which is rare in these competitions. She did a heartfelt version of Christina Aguilera's Beautiful, but forgot the words. It almost seems like she subconsciously finds ways to sabotage her chances. Dannii saw a diamond in the rough and decided to take the risk. </p> <p><strong>Ruth Lorenzo</strong> was not a bad singer, as she continued to charm us with Spanish/English versions of pop songs (in this case, True Colors), but she should not have been picked over Suzie Furlong, who dazzled with One Day I'll Fly Away. Was it Ruth's tears that did it?</p> <p>Simon Cowell's 14- to 24-year-old boys were not as strong as the girls. <strong>Austin Drage</strong> is the best of them. After he sang Michael Jackson's She's Out of My Life, Simon Cowell said: \"That performance will change that boy's life forever\" and, rightly, chose him for his final three.</p> <p><strong>Scott Bruton</strong> sang one of my favourite songs: Bonnie Raitt's I Can't Make You Love Me. I thought it was a lukewarm rendition but, fortunately for Scott, Simon disagreed and put him through. </p> <p><strong>Eoghan Quinn</strong> has a decent voice, but so far I think it lacks character, so singing a Boyzone song was the perfect choice. It certainly won Simon over. Mali, who in the initial auditions had loads of character, must have left it all back in Blighty, and lost out.</p> <p>Louis Walsh was spot on in his selection in the group category. <strong>JLS's</strong> version of Jordin Sparks' No Air was shaky at first, but they were blending beautifully by the end. Louis worried that the general public may not get them. Was that because they're all black? Surely not. He chose them.</p> <p><strong>Bad Lashes</strong> made an interesting and brave song choice in Oasis' Wonderwall, and were definitely the best girl group. They also have a great singer in the soloist. This is the group that Louis called \"a bunch of hairdressers\" in the initial auditions. </p> <p><strong>Girlband</strong>, the third group to get through, didn't really make an impression but, unlike Priority \u2013 the boy band put together by the judges \u2013 they had actually rehearsed more, and that was enough to give them the edge.</p> <p>Unlike the other judges, Cheryl picked the songs for her 14- to 24-year-old girls - which was undoubtedly the toughest category. The biggest upset, to me, was that Hannah Bradbeer didn't get through. Her rendition of Piece of My Heart gave me (and the judges) goosebumps. In any other category she would have sailed through. Maybe she can come back in three years, when she's 25.</p> <p><strong>Diana Vickers</strong> sounded hoarse as she struggled through Nothing Compares to You with her eyes closed (and I mean that literally). Still, she's got that indie-girl angle that makes her stand out, so she made it. </p> <p><strong>Laura White</strong> was given a tough tune \u2013 Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River. She was up to the challenge. I have a feeling that it was a choice between her and Hannah, and I'm still not sure if Cheryl made the right decision in going for Laura. </p> <p><strong>Alexandra Burke</strong> may just be another Leona Lewis in the making. Like Cheryl said, she needs to put a bit more of herself in the vocals and show more vulnerability. Everything else seems to already be in place. </p> <p>From now on, it's up to the viewers. My favourites of the finalists are Alexandra, Austin, Rachel and Bad Lashes. Which ones are yours? Can you already see the winner among the final 12?</p>",
  "<p>S\u00f8ran Kierkegaard used to tell parables by way of doing philosophy. One went like this. An ancient Greek was asked to define religion. He asked for time to prepare an answer. When the agreed period had elapsed he asked for some more time, and then more, and more, and so on. In short, he refused to answer. \"In this way,\" Kierkegaard concludes, \"he wished to express symbolically that he regarded the question as unanswerable\".</p> <p>In the last few days, two pieces of research have hit the headlines purporting to show some aspect of how religion works, and indeed that it does work. One claimed that believers gazing upon images of the Virgin Mary<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/01/medicalresearch.humanbehaviour\">felt less pain than a control group</a>. Another that religious convictions about the supernatural make us <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/03/psychology.religion\">more honest and trusting</a>. Both utilise common assumptions about belief, in the first case that it serves mostly to provide consolation, in the second that it is about avoiding the wrath of moralising gods.</p> <p>The researchers would do well to ponder Kierkegaard's story, or even better, consult a theologian \u2013 that is to say, an expert \u2013 before presuming too much about the phenomenon they seek to study.</p> <p>If they did, they might avoid some of the potty conclusions they reach. For example, the Virgin-eases-pain story included the possibility that Our Lady's analgesic works as well for lapsed Catholics as mass goers. Should this be taken as support for the theological conviction that God is faithful even when we are not? </p> <p>The serious point is that religions are massively diverse. Many Christians and Muslims may seek salvation from punishment in heaven. Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs don't. And as for Jews, the third of the Abrahamic religions, \"the idea of Hell and eternal damnation is foreign\", according to the Chambers Dictionary of Belief and Religions. Even within one religion, ideas will differ enormously.</p> <p>Another thing that is striking about the researchers' understanding of religion is how belief in God is interpreted as a kind of cost-benefit analysis. This piece of economics is, in turn, justified by a certain kind of evolutionary theory. But you don't need to turn to theologians or philosophers to find unease with such Darwinism.</p> <p>The primatologist Frans de Waal expressed the concern well in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Our-Inner-Ape-Primatologist-Explains/dp/1594481962/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223043720&amp;sr=1-1_\">Our Inner Ape</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>At the same time that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher preached that greed was good for society, good for the economy, and certainly good for those with anything to be greedy about, biologists published books in support of these views.</p> </blockquote> <p> He is particularly concerned about the notion that altruism stems from egoistic motives, goodwill that arises from the mutual scratching of backs. \"Love is unheard of, sympathy is absent, and goodness a mere illusion,\" he writes. The critique is all the more powerful since it is not based on philosophical concerns but on empirical evidence. De Waal believes that the chimps and bonobos he has observed understand, demonstrate and even value genuine altruism and empathy.</p> <p>That there is something distinctly post-Thatcherite about the cost-benefit approach to religion is also suggested by comparing what previous generations of sociologists and economists made of belief. Durkheim is the outstanding example, notably in his seminal study <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Suicide-Penguin-Classics-Emile-Durkheim/dp/0140449671/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223043870&amp;sr=1-1\">Suicide</a>. It showed that the greater a sense of obligation people have, the less likely they are to want to end it all. And that religion provides the best ties of all.</p> <p>However, Durkheim was enough of a theologian to realise that it is not beliefs about divinities per se that count. Rather it is the connection with other people that religious practice nurtures which is so valuable. Confessional statements are but a secondary expression of that belonging. Praxis counts, not doxis. In other words, contemporary research that focuses on what people may say about God, puts the cart before the horse. Religion is not the cause, it is the expression of the meaning and significance people find in their lives. It is that meaning and significance which \u2013 let us say for the sake of argument \u2013 leads them to, say, feel less pain or trust others more.</p> <p>By interpreting religion from within an essentially economic theory, the researchers exclude what might actually be true about belief. For maybe agnostics, like myself, and atheists should be more open to religion's challenge? Mightn't it be the case that belief is associated with greater degrees of trust because believers have seen that the world can actually be trusted? Or to put it another way, just because we have evolved into meaning-seeking creatures doesn't mean there isn't meaning out there to be found.</p>",

  "<h2>The Film</h2> <p>During the 1960s and 1970s Arthur Penn made a series of films that uncompromisingly engaged with the reality of America's violent past. Penn re-invented the gangster genre with Bonnie and Clyde (1967), a film that re-cast the main protagonists as lovers-on-the-run, in French nouvelle vague style.</p> <p>Penn's directorial career began with The Left Handed Gun (1958). This was a western story that looked at one of the most compelling stories of the old west \u2013 the legend of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. The film stars Paul Newman in the role of Billy, with John Dehner as Pat.</p> <p>The film was an attempt by Penn to unpick the romanticised mythology of the west in Hollywood. The revisionist western of the 1960s and 1970s accepted the arbitrary violence of the wild-west as a product of social, political and economic forces beyond the control or understanding of its cast. Accordingly, the new heroes were presented as composite characters with both good and evil in their natures. Left Handed Gun was originally conceived as a vehicle for James Dean, the poster boy of American teenage anxiety and rebellion during the 1950s.</p> <p>The revisionist western is, at its most accomplished, a proto-Marxist exposition of the determining forces that shaped the westward American expansion. The genre also includes Once Upon a Time in the West from 1968, and Heaven's Gate (1980). These films refuse the complacent moral judgements used to justify the manifest destiny of western expansion.</p> <p>Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kidd (1973), with Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and Bob Dylan was part of a slightly different effort. Peckinpah's project, begun with Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969), sought to make a definitive statement about the American west. For Peckinpah, the isolation of the far west removed all but the most basic of determining forces. The result was an unforgiving environment that revealed the moral integrity, or otherwise, of the men and women placed within it. For Peckinpah, failure was always met with a bullet. More recently, Clint Eastwood has explored this version of the west.</p> <h2>The Legend of Pat and Billy</h2> <p>The legend plays itself out against a backdrop of the small, but intensely violent, Lincoln County wars. This conflict pitched the vested interests of ranchers against those of the wider community. The war ranged across New Mexico in America's southwest during 1878.</p> <p>Billy the Kid was a member of the ranchers' outlaw force, named The Regulators. These enforcers, drawn from criminal elements across the southwest, eventually ran out of control. They were brutally suppressed in a series of bloody shoot-outs. Those that survived were dispersed and forced on the run. The implacable law-man Pat Garrett, eventually tracked, caught and executed Billy in 1881.</p> <p>The legend of Pat and Billy was mostly created through the sensationalist memoir published by Pat Garrett in 1882. The myth showed Garrett as an enforcer who would follow his prey to the inevitable and bloody conclusion. This myth has been variously recast across American history and in various contexts, so that corruption and lawlessness will never, in the USA, be allowed to go unpunished.</p> <p>Billy the Kid, like Jesse James, is one of the hero villains of the wild-west. His reputation as a violent killer was tempered by recollections of his friendly and personable character. Surviving photographs of Billy show his appreciation of fine clothes. He was remembered as a neat dresser who favoured an unadorned Mexican sombrero hat. So, Billy survives as both outlaw and folk hero dandy.</p> <p>The attempt, by revisionist Hollywood, to rehabilitate the western outlaw reached its apotheosis in George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).</p> <h2>The Poster</h2> <p>This week's poster is a piece of ephemera from the Royal College of Art in London. The poster is a simple, rough-and-ready, example of student design and screen-printing.</p> <p>The design of the poster, narrow portrait, allowed it to be printed two-up on double crown paper measuring 20x30 inches. The poster was printed in a tiny print run for display within the College. The make-ready for screen-printing would have taken a few hours using new photo-mechanical processes.</p> <p>The poster design is made up of several pictorial elements. These are the map of the USA, the lawman's stripes and the revolver. The map is embellished with a line of letterpress printing, The Western Plains. This second printing, combining two quite separate forms of printmaking would only have been possible within the non-commercial environment of the RCA.</p> <p>The success, or otherwise, of poster designs at the RCA could always be judged by how many were removed from the walls and how quickly. John Lewis, typographer at the RCA, saved this example.</p> <h2>The RCA</h2> <p>The Royal College of Art played a key role in the transformations of British visual culture during the 1960s. The first generation of post-war designers rejected the sense of established good taste prevailing in Britain at the end of the 1950s. The use of irregular typography, the general references to popular culture, and to American popular culture in particular, were strategies calculated to wind up the old guard.</p> <p>The conceptualisation of society based around the hedonistic consumerism of experience and lifestyle began in the early 1950s at the ICA in London. The artists and architects associated with the Independent Group rejected established and polite good taste. These artists revelled in the more energetic and visceral possibilities of cultural production.</p> <p>In this context, it was entirely appropriate that the College Film Society should provide screenings of American, rather than of higher-brow, European art-house films.</p> <p>The College magazine Ark provides a more permanent legacy of these ideas. The editors recall that their efforts were an attempt to produce a magazine as part of a visual culture whose experience was immediate and exciting. They rejected the usual idea that the work should be about something beyond itself and the immediate here-and-now.</p> <p>Eventually, these ideas formed the basis of swinging London and its politics of an ephemeral and hedonistic consumption.

Read this morning's New York Times, Obama! Obama! How about Bill Ayers, Obama!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There have been several newspaper articles investigating Obama's relationship with Ayers. They have <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/05/fact-check-is-obama-palling-around-with-terrorists/\">professional connections but aren't close</a>, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/politics/04ayers.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=ayers&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1\">New York Times article finds</a>.</p> <p>The conservative blogosphere in the US has been much more aggressive than the McCain campaign itself in pushing Obama's connection to 60s radical William Ayers. Just do a search on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Wx0&amp;q=New+York+Times+White+wash+Obama&amp;btnG=Search\">New York Times Obama whitewash</a>, and you'll see that conservative bloggers don't believe the media's fact checking. But this like other allegations and rumours continue to rumble around the internet. How do these messages spread? </p> <p>Barack Obama's presidential campaign has faced scrutiny over more than his connection to Bill Ayers. He has also had to rebut online rumours that he secretly is a Muslim, some sort of <a href=\"http://wwwwakeupamericans-spree.blogspot.com/2008/07/manchurian-candidate-muslim-takeover-of.html\">Islamic Manchurian candidate</a>. Some have even claimed that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/28/obama-antichrist-nc/\">he is the anti-Christ</a>, although how one would go about proving or disproving that is beyond me. <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/antichrist.asp\">Internet rumour-debunking site Snopes</a> tries.</p> <p>Of course, Democrats aren't the only ones who face rumours. Sarah Palin herself was forced to reveal that her daughter <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/01/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4405099.shtml\">Bristol Palin was pregnant after rumours</a> circulated online that the vice presidential nominee wasn't the mother of her fifth child.</p> <p>Usually the source of a <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/36410.html\">rumour is difficult to track down</a>, and it's <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=9137C354-3048-5C12-000A32656C8CAEA4\">devilishly difficult to rebut them</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/\">Jon Kleinberg at Cornell University</a> is studying <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4633.full\">the phenomenon</a>, and he found that instead of spreading virally, like a biological contagion, political rumours often spread quite slowly and take reinforcement. People often wait to hear a message twice before passing it on to a couple of people.</p> <p>It's not just people forwarding e-mails. Studies have been done looking at the logs of Google searches, and earlier this year, the top two searches for Barack Obama were looking for his biography, but the fifth or sixth most popular search term was \"Obama Christian or Muslim\".</p> <p>\"People were using the internet to figure this out for once and for all,\" Kleinberg said.</p> <p>And these messages are hard to kill off. One of the most popular chain e-mails dates back to a 1995 message saying that the US government was looking to end funding for National Public Radio, the public radio broadcaster in the US. Another perennial favourite is a 1997 e-mail saying that the US government was looking to institute a five cent tax on every e-mail.</p> <p>More than a decade later, these chain e-mails are still rumbling around the internet. I doubt these political rumours will die in the next 30 days before Americans cast their ballots on 4 November.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a> Radio 4 specialist factual commissioning editor, Andrew Caspari, is to leave the station after a decade in the post.</p> <p>Caspari, who is responsible for around 60 programmes and strands, will be replaced by the Radio 3 editor of arts, Mohit Bakaya, who currently runs topical nightly arts show Night Waves.</p> <p>The BBC has appointed Caspari as its new head of online speech radio, where he is expected to ensure that sites across the entire network fully integrate relevant radio programmes and content.</p> <p>He will officially take up his new post on Wednesday. </p> <p>His Radio 4 job, which accounts for around a quarter of the station's \u00a340m annual programme budget, involves overseeing many of the regular strands which define the network across a range of genres including current affairs, science, law and natural history.</p> <p>Programmes include Any Questions? and Any Answers?, Yesterday in Parliament, Thought for the Day, File on 4, Front Row, Unreliable Evidence, Ramblings, Feedback, All in the Mind, The Moral Maze, Sunday Worship and, from last week, The Media Show.</p> <p>Caspari, who joined the Today programme in the 80s after a spell as a presenter on BBC Radio Merseyside, was part of a small team which in 1998 shook up Radio 4 in a controversial overhaul headed by the then controller, James Boyle.</p> <p>Many of the strands he helped introduce still survive, including Broadcasting House, Front Row, Open Book, The Choice and Material World. </p> <p>Caspari said of the 1998 revamp: \"It became a personal thing, but if we had not taken on sacred cows we would not have got some of the new things on air, which are now so popular. </p> <p>\"I am especially proud of Front Row, which runs every evening at 7.15 pm, and attracts around 2.25 million people a week.\"</p> <p>Radio 4 is currently in rude health and is introducing new presenters under controller Mark Damazer. It is generally deemed to have not sacrificed its reputation for quality despite annual cutbacks.</p> <p>Caspari said he had learned that the Radio 4 audience had \"high expectations\" of everything. </p> <p>\"While they like the habit and stability of the Radio 4 schedule, they are much more flexible and open-minded and less stuffy about the network than the caricature would have you believe,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The key for them is a threshold of quality. If what we do is intelligent and original then there is a huge canvas on which to play and vary things.\" </p> <p>He said that one of his biggest regrets was not being able to find the right kind of sports talk programme for Radio 4, despite several tries with Late Tackle and Last Man In.</p> <p>Bakaya stood in last year for Caspari when he took an attachment at the BBC World Service.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>So where are we in the Great London Police Drama? Much debate has raged over whether Mayor Johnson's effective ousting of Ian Blair last Thursday was driven by political ideology or a need for more productive policing, or was even an <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/tim-newburn-boris-has-some-explaining-to-do-951669.html\">unintended consequence</a>. Friday's Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/03/blair.conservatives\">broke the story</a> \u2013 repeated everywhere else all weekend \u2013 that the outgoing Commissioner was told at the fateful meeting, also attended by Kit Malthouse and MPA chief executive Catherine Crawford, that there would be no rush to replace him because a Tory government was on its way and would deliver a top cop to a Tory mayor's taste. </p> <p>This suggestion has been sharply denied both on the record and into my right ear as I trudged sleeplessly past <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/claptonian/\">Clapton Pond</a> clutching a loaf of bad-for-you bread early on Friday morning. The Guardian, though, sticks by its sources. If only I could tell you everything I've been told about each version of events, well, you still might not know which to believe. I'm trying figure out if there's a way both can be true. It's tough work, I'm telling you. </p> <p>Attention has since turned to Blair's successor and the manner in which he will be chosen. The formal power to hire and fire remains with the Home Secretary, but Johnson's intervention shows that in the right circumstances his informal power can be decisive. He's now working hard to manage the fallout from this. Strong reactions from West Yorkshire Chief Constable Sir <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23563627-details/Met+job+%27possible%27+criticises+Mayor/article.do\">Norman Bettinson</a>, ACPO President <a href=\"http://www.acpo.police.uk/pressrelease.asp?PR_GUID={D1F0D5D0-EBDF-4880-8D88-898E002FC559}\">Ken Jones</a> (thanks, <a href=\"http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/10/top-cops-fight-back-as-boris-fixes.html\">Troll</a>) and Blair's predecessor <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/ianblair/3140000/Sir-Ian-Blair-resignation-Lord-Stevens-says-Metropolitan-Police-must-never-be-politicised.html\">Sir John Stevens</a> have demonstrated the resistance among senior policeman to closer control by politicians. </p> <p>I'm told that Johnson's initial low profile and refusal to answer questions about Blair was motivated by a desire to let him leave with dignity. Whatever, the mayor broke cover on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00dx462/\">The Politics Show</a> yesterday, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7653520.stm\">dismissing</a> the \"political\" charge as \"poppycock, balderdash and tripe\" \u2013 wouldn't a simple \"bollocks\" have sufficed? \u2013 and denying that a constitutional precedent had been set. Yet it is difficult to see how Johnson's opinions about candidates for next leader of the Met won't carry more weight now than they would have this time last week. </p> <p>Who does the mayor have his eye on? Looks like <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/ianblair/3131098/Sir-Ian-Blair-resignation-American-police-chief-Bill-Bratton-denies-link-to-top-job.html\">a line can be drawn</a> under speculation that Bill Bratton, the man who implemented Rudi Giuliani's alleged \"miracle\" in New York \u2013 and, inconveniently for \"zero tolerance\" evangelists, an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/11/21/do2108.xml\">admirer of Blair</a> - is in the frame. Should we read anything into Kit Malthouse's speaking of the next permanent appointment being a \"he or <strong>she</strong>?\" </p> <p>Search me. But as he prepares to chair the <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/news/press/2008/08-051.htm\">MPA</a> for the first time this morning, Johnson is surely aware that he needs to tread very carefully. Populist button-pushing about removing \"political correctness\" from policing such as he indulged in (albeit in moderation) during the election campaign will not endear him to ethnic minority officers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/05/police\">unappeased</a> by Blair departure and I'm encouraged that, just prior to publishing this post, I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/06/police.race\">read</a> and hear on the Today programme that Johnson is set to launch an inquiry into racism in the Met. He'll need to be very mindful too that stop-and-search a la Blunt 2 remains a potential danger to building the trust with the public that successful policing depends on far more than tech tools like knife arches or crime maps.</p> <p>For the good of the Met and London as a whole, Johnson needs to still public and police disquiet alike. I'm assured that a return of the damaging, self-defeating, macho \"canteen culture\" street policing of yore is not considered desirable. The mayor would be wise to spread that message around.</p>"
