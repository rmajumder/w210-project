  "<p>Boris Johnson's hair is looking uncharacteristically tamed. \"Yes, I was told to get a haircut,\" says London's mayor glumly, in the manner of Just William submitting to the unfathomable protocol of grown-ups. \"Because I had to go on Richard &amp; Judy yesterday.\" </p> <p>The mournful look barely lasts a second, though, before lifting when I ask how his city is coming along. \"In cracking shape, thank you. Getting better every day. More and more shipshape. And generally ready for action.\" Johnson offers his impressions of his new job with exuberant delight. </p> <p>\"It's bigger than I'd expected. Much, much bigger. But also better. It's a very big job. Bigger, more challenging, more intellectually challenging than anything I've ever done. I didn't really know what it would be like. But I could tell it was a wonderful job. I remember years ago, when [Michael] Heseltine first started rabbiting on about it, thinking, golly, that would be a fantastic thing to do.\" </p> <p>A memorable feature of the mayoral election campaign was the contrast between Johnson's enthusiasm and the jaded air of the incumbent, Ken Livingstone. Observers were in no doubt that Johnson really wanted the job. After 100 days in office, however, some are still not entirely clear why. Johnson never produced a general manifesto, and city hall staff, accustomed to the ideological clarity of purpose of his predecessor, have privately expressed confusion about exactly what their new boss wants to do with the capital. So which words would define his vision for London? </p> <p>\"Happy, green, clean, safe. Yeah. And pioneering on the whole environmental agenda, taking that stuff seriously, making London the centre of the new global green revolution. You know, if you want to ... flog a new green idea, then London should be the place where it happens.\" </p> <p>So why has he not yet appointed a deputy mayor for the environment? \"Because we're going to appoint a superb environmental adviser very shortly.\" By law, the mayor is required to set out a timetable for strategies on air quality, municipal waste, ambient noise and climate change - none of which has yet materialised. </p> <p>When I ask when these will be announced, the reply is halting. \"We will be building up a ... a ... strategy ... and, you know, revising a lot of the targets over the, er, next few months. But I'm sticking to our general desire to reduce CO2 by 60% by 2025. And, you know, you're going to see some really fantastic things on cycling. I would say to people, add that adjective - I mean, no, cycling's not an adjective, it's a participle - add that participle, OK? It's going to be clean, green, safe - and cycling.\" </p> <p>It will still be motoring, though. Livingstone's pounds 25 daily charge for gas guzzlers was quickly cancelled by Johnson, and this week plans to pedestrianise part of Parliament Square, and order 60 hydrogen vehicles, were also scrapped. Less than a month ago, Johnson had described hydrogen as an \"exciting fuel of the future\", but couldn't be quizzed on his cancellation of the order yesterday, because he is now on holiday. </p> <p>There have been changes elsewhere. Two of his major appointments have had to resign. Ray Lewis's claims about his professional credentials were exposed as false, and the deputy chief of staff, James McGrath, stood down after suggesting that Caribbean immigrants unhappy with London under Johnson should \"go, if they don't like it here\". \"I don't think James was a racist,\" Johnson says quietly. \"But I think his comments were capable of perpetual misconstruction, which was not going to be helpful.\" </p> <p>Having himself once described black people as \"piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles\", I wonder what made McGrath's comments so offensive to Johnson as to require his resignation. </p> <p>\"Well,\" he says, looking pained, \"I just think it would have made things very difficult for him, it would have sent out a wrong signal to a large, erm ... you know, chunk of the London population, that we weren't here to work for all of them.\" He brightens, and swishes a fist through the air. \"And we're here to work for everybody in London, OK?\" </p> <p>Is the mayor relaxed about the large number of senior women's job losses at city hall? \"But I believe passionately in the government of women.\" Presumably he can't therefore have been happy to see so many senior female staff sacked? \"Well. Er, I'm not quite sure it's true. I dispute your premise.\" </p> <p>Even his first deputy mayor did not dispute that all five senior female directors had been dismissed and their replacements were male. \"Nothing would make me happier than to be able to boast a top team that was more diverse,\" Tim Parker told the assembly. But there weren't any women, according to Parker, who were up to the job. </p> <p>\"Look,\" Johnson says, \"I'm a great believer in organisations that are run by women. The Spectator under me was a 'feminocracy'.\" How does he explain their wholesale dismissal then? \"Well, you know ...\" I'm not sure I do, I confess. Can't he help? \"Well, I'd have to look at the numbers. But my impression is that we are a completely equal opportunities employer. And I'm absolutely determined to remain so.\" </p> <p>The minutiae of interminable meetings, he agrees, can sometimes be a drag. \"I think meetings can ... sometimes it's a bit like running in a dream, you get that heavy feeling in your legs, and you feel you can hardly move, it's just like treacle. And we've got some things done quickly. But some things you've got to bang at, and then you've got to bang again, and keep banging. So when you do come into government - and I'm in government now, you know, I'm running this thing, you find actually how much energy it needs to push things along. And you need good people around you, to help you push it along.\" </p> <p>One concern has been the degree of delegation to deputies and advisers. On taking office, Johnson handed responsibility for all major planning decisions to a deputy mayor and, when quizzed by assembly members last month, he could not name a single one made since he came to power. Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics, warned in the Evening Standard this week about the \"risk of a polycentric administration\" and a \"confused mayoral voice\". </p> <p>Johnson's view? \"It's perfectly true that when I came in, just as a short term measure - I mean, you know what planning's like, it's mega stuff, you've got to look at big balsa wood models of new developments and you've got to get your head around the arguments. So I said listen, I've got a lot to do in the next couple of months, so I did temporarily delegate my powers - but I'll be taking them back soon. Planning is central to my vision for London. If you're going to build a wonderful site in the middle of London ... and you've got this epic opportunity to build something that's going to last for 100 years, then for God's sake put something on it that's going to be worth looking at.\" </p> <p>In his book, Blink, Malcolm Gladwell described research into medical malpractice suits. Researchers recorded hundreds of conversations between doctors and their patients and distorted the recordings to create \"a kind of garble that preserves intonation, pitch and rhythm, but erases content\". They found they could accurately predict the likelihood of a lawsuit- without even knowing what was being said - from the sound of the doctor's voice. </p> <p>It would be fascinating to see a similar study conducted on politicians' speech patterns, because Johnson's are striking. His daredevil panache - he refers to Venezuela's Hugo Chavez as a \"foreign dictator\" - has not been tamed, nor has his irreverence. \"Oh, incessantly\", he laughs, when asked how often he and the Tory leader, David Cameron, talk. \"We're scarcely ever off the phone. In fact I'm going to ring him now. Let's ring Cameron.\" Let's not, his aide interjects. </p> <p>Whenever he's drawn into the measured political discourse, he comes unstuck. \"Using the resources of the Mayor's Fund for London, and the London Development Agency, to start to, you know... encourage a boom in, er... institutions of all kinds, people who are providing, um, um...\" </p> <p>Whereas Gordon Brown's fluency in the language of policy seems to alienate voters, Johnson's words don't so much tell a story as paint a picture - of irrepressible positivity and enthusiasm. Flaws or contradictions are swept aside by the sheer force of his optimism. It's hugely engaging, and so far, people appear to like it. Maybe the likelihood of being elected, like being sued, lies not in what leaders say but how they sound. </p> <p>\"So what haven't I told you?\" he calls out as I'm leaving. \"It is, I promise you, the most wonderful job.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"As a story of survival, from cosy beginnings to near destitution to middle-aged and elderly triumph . . . this book reads like a fable,\" said Jackie Wullschlager in the Financial Times, reviewing So I Have Thought of You: The Letters of Penelope Fitzgerald . \"The story of how messy life is transformed into crystalline art forms an arc across this collection, and edges us closer to an understanding of what makes her final novels - Innocence , The Beginning of Spring , The Blue Flower - among the masterpieces of late 20th-century British fiction.\" \"This volume is edited by her son-in-law, Terence Dooley, and though she would have welcomed this act of filial piety, she might have regretted some of its execution,\" observed Philip Hensher in the Telegraph. \"The notes are decidedly skimpy . . . some serious work on the apparatus before the paperback would be very welcome. She deserves, as no one doubts, the Rolls-Royce treatment.\" </p> <p>\"This is a fabulous book that drags Vermeer away from our complacent Eurocentric assumptions of his insular domesticity,\" declared Jerry Brotton in the Sunday Telegraph, reviewing Vermeer's Hat . \"The writing is effortless but compelling, and Timothy Brook is a wonderful storyteller. I doubt I will read a better book this year.\" </p> <p>\"Why does Brook start his story in Delft?\" asked Sarah Burton in the Spectator. \"Just as many of the trails he follows are characterised by accidental occurrences that cause journeys to change course, one of the reasons he begins in Delft is because he fell off his bike there. That accident has resulted in a highly successful experiment in historical storytelling which is clear, original, thoughtful and engaging. Brook should definitely go cycling more often.\" </p> <p>\"In her new novel, Bernardine Evaristo . . . has taken her boldest step to date,\" announced Diana Evans in the Independent, reviewing Blonde Roots . \"She imagines it was Africans who enslaved Europeans . . . Running through these pages is not just a feisty, hyperactive imagination asking 'what if?', but an unhealed African heart with the question, 'how does it feel?' This is a powerful gesture of fearless thematic ownership by one of the UK's most unusual and challenging writers.\" However, Sara Wajid in the New Statesman was not won over. \"The inversion of African and European roles is literally skin-deep,\" she complained. \"Big questions about economics and the cultural impact of the real-life slave trade are dodged entirely . . . The question Blonde Roots poses is not so much 'What if Africans had enslaved Europeans?' as 'What if Europeans had black skin?' To which the answer appears to be: 'Not much.'\"</p>",
  "<p>My eyes are either wide because I have just been blinded by the actual science behind flipping a McDonald's burger or because Janette Moran has just told me how much holiday she's taken this year. </p> <p>Moran, a store manager with the multinational burger chain, thought<br>she might use her paid 10-week break (yes, you read that right) to go travelling to India, but instead she pottered around the Canaries for a few weeks before doing up her house and going shopping.</p> <p>Lest you think the 28-year-old from Oldham was pulling the mother of all sickies, this vacation coup was a result of her having worked for McDonald's for 10 years. She goes on to describe what might be the most spectacular works trip ever \u2014 a week in Sydney, where her bosses hired out all of the harbour's restaurants and held a fireworks display for its global managers. </p> <p>Moran manages the Manchester St Ann's Square branch of McDonald's, heading up a staff of 68. She has worked for McDonald's in one form or another since she left school, seeing her through legal executive training at Oldham College and then a law degree at the University of Manchester. </p> <p>Despite her legal aspirations, she was faced with a life-changing decision when it came to entering the workplace. \"The work I was looking at disappointed me, to be honest,\" she says. \"I found it quite boring and it wasn't as involved as I thought it would be. I had been promoted within McDonald's and the wages were very good so I stayed put. Every job I went for had to compete with what I had here.\"</p> <p>Many people might assume that career progression at McDonald's consists of gathering gold stars on your lapel but the well-heeled Moran, whose salary is \"in excess of \u00a330,000\" is living proof that this couldn't be further from the truth. The company invests on average around \u00a315 m in training and development in the UK each year.</p> <p>But, of course, to get where she is now, she had to learn the ropes and as she shows me round the kitchen, she shakes chips, wipes grills and rearranges shelves without missing a beat.</p> <p>It's time for me to take my first foray into fast food. I wash my hands for what seems like the millionth time (the rules say every half an hour) and start to create some of the world's most recognisable fast food. To start with I put the buns in the toaster the wrong way round so one comes out underdone (it is binned). I put too much lettuce (it should be 14g) on the crown (even parts of the bun have names to learn), and I press too hard on the tartare sauce and make a pig's ear of a Filet-O- Fish. I am super-stressed and it's only 11.30am. A girl at my shoulder worriedly asks if I will be here for the lunchtime rush. Moran leads me away and talks me through the new computerised system which tracks orders and shows me how charts are used to show the movement of stock against sales. As we enter her office, I have never been so pleased to leave a kitchen in my life. Not that I would be up to the admin either. I have never heard so many acronyms in my life. FIFOs jostle with BOPs and NABITs and there are so many vital checklists that my eyes nearly start to bleed.</p> <p>Granted, I have barely been here long enough to memorise how long<br>the fries are allowed to stand for before they are ditched, but it seems to me that if anyone deserves a 10-week holiday and a trip to Oz, a McDonald's store manager does. But I'm going home, and I'm lovin' it.</p> <h2>Jobs to go</h2> <p><strong>TGI Fridays</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.tgifridays.co.uk\">tgifridays.co.uk</a><br>Ongoing recruitment</p> <p><strong>Burger King</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.burgerking.co.uk\">burgerking.co.uk</a><br>Various training positions.

  "<p>You didn't think I would make a good wife for your first son \u2014 I didn't know how to work a farm, to carry water on my head from the stream, to cook on the three stones of your wood fireplace. In your eyes, my slim figure alone made it unlikely that I could have children, but as well as that, I was white, and everyone had told you what seemed obvious anyway \u2014 that it was not possible for a white woman and a black man to have a child. You didn't believe your son when he told you that we had finally decided against marrying.</p> <p>It just didn't seem workable in our circumstances, in 1965. I had come from England to set the final seal on our goodbyes, by visiting the place where the man I loved had come from.</p> <p>I know what you would say if you were here, listening to this. You would shake your head and smile at me, call my name and say, \"Oh, why bring up those old things? They are finished. They are finished.\"</p> <p>And you would be right. Eventually, your son and I did marry \u2014 with your blessing \u2014 and I will never forget when you came to our house a year later to carry out the traditional mother-in-law's task of showing me how to bath our newborn child. You held her in your hands, turning her in all directions, wonder and pride on your face, saying, \"There is nothing wrong with this child, nothing wrong, nothing wrong at all!\"</p> <p>You taught me so many things, Big Mammy. Without you, I would never have made the close ties I enjoy throughout the wider family.</p> <p>Unlikely though it seemed, your outlook on life had a great deal in common with that of my mother in England; my first, much-loved mother who gave birth to me and brought me up. You and she both believed that if you cared for another woman's child who was away from home, another woman would care for yours.</p> <p>I was surprised when I showed my father the photograph I had taken of you on that first visit and he said: \"She is a handsome woman, isn't<br>she? They used to say my mother was handsome.\"</p> <p>An old-fashioned word to describe a woman, I thought, but it was apt. You had the same chiselled lips as your son, the same long, sharp ridge to your nose, an air of strength \u2014 strength you later lent me when times were hard. It was only years after I took the photo that I got to know you were cross that I had not given you the chance to change from your farm clothes to the new ones you kept in your trunk. </p> <p>You came to bath all our newly born babies and you gave them their African names. When one of them, learning to read, asked you how to read a difficult word, you laughed and said you didn't know. But you cared about education. Later on, when the children were older and you noticed they had been distracted from their homework, you chivvied them to get on with it, and told them that even though you couldn't read, you knew that was not how \"book-work\" was done.</p> <p>When our children left Africa for Europe, to do \"stronger book-work\", you blessed them, anointing their foreheads with soil from your husband's grave and prayed that they would remember where they came from.</p> <p>You understood that education and work took people away from home. In the colonial days, you had lived with your husband on the border between French Central Africa and British West Africa, where his work as a sergeant in the British Customs &amp; Excise had taken him.

  "<p>Mark Watson is a prodigy: sell-out tours, published novelist and panellist on numerous TV shows - and all this at the tender age of 28. In his latest Edinburgh show, Watson attempts to chronicle every thought he has ever had, of which I imagine there are many. Making his name in Edinburgh with his now-legendary, concept-driven experience shows such as Mark Watson (And Friends) Take Control Of The World In 24 Hours and Crap At The Environment, this year sees him trying to capitalise on his previous cult success at the Fringe as he plays the 700-seater Pleasance Grand. It's a pretty large space to fill, but Watson easily has the wit and charisma to do it. </p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336355517\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Russia and Georgia were effectively at war last night after a festering conflict in the Caucasus plunged out of control following a Georgian military attempt to recover its breakaway region of South Ossetia.</p> <p>Tanks and artillery from Russia's 58th army were in Tskhinvali, South Ossetia's capital, to prevent Georgian forces attacking Russian peacekeepers and civilians, the defence ministry in Moscow said.</p> <p>Russian soldiers in the capital said their artillery had fired at Georgian forces - the first confirmed engagement between the two countries' troops, and the two sides were last night engaged in heavy fighting. </p> <p>\"Our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the Georgian army in the southern region of Tskhinvali,\" a Russian military spokesman told Interfax. </p> <p>Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili said Russian tanks were rumbling into South Ossetia and Georgian officials said Russian jets had bombed three military bases and the Black Sea port of Poti. </p> <p>\"One hundred and fifty Russian tanks, armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered South Ossetia. This is a clear intrusion. We have Russian tanks on our territory, jets on our territory in broad daylight,\" Saakashvili told a news conference. Tbilisi was planning to declare martial law, said Kakha Lomaia the secretary of Georgia's security council. </p> <p>At the United Nations, Russian and Georgian envoys hurled accusations at each other, as a divided security council yesterday failed to agree on language calling for an end to the fighting, in a second emergency meeting in under 12 hours. The council finally broke off in a stalemate late last night, but plans to resume meeting this morning.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian leader, Eduard Kokoity, claimed 1,400 civilians had been killed. There was no independent confirmation of his assertion, but witnesses said the city was devastated. Lyudmila Ostayeva, who had fled the city with her family, said: \"I saw bodies lying on the streets, around ruined buildings, in cars. There is hardly a single building left undamaged.\"</p> <p>There are fears of full-blown war in the region, which is a crucial energy transit route in which Russia and the west are vying for influence. President George Bush pledged US support for Georgia's territorial integrity and the US, EU and Nato called for an immediate ceasefire.</p> <p>The Russian retaliation came swiftly after Georgian forces made an overnight assault on South Ossetia. The Russians were enraged that the Georgians had targeted their peacekeepers, killing more than 10 of them and injuring 30, according to the Russian defence ministry.</p> <p>Saakashvili accused Russia of being the aggressor, but the assault seemed timed to coincide with today's launch of the Olympic games. \"Most decision-makers have gone for the holidays,\" he told CNN. \"Brilliant moment to attack a small country.\" </p> <p>President Dmitry Medvedev chaired an emergency session of Russia's security council, after which he said: \"My duty as Russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of Russian citizens, wherever they are ... We will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished. Those guilty will receive due punishment.\"</p> <p>Many people in South Ossetia and Georgia's other breakaway region, Abkhazia, have Russian citizenship. In Beijing, the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, met Bush briefly and they agreed that nobody wanted war. But Putin said that \"many Russian volunteers intended to go to South Ossetia and he said it was very difficult to maintain peace in the region\", Interfax quoted the prime minister's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, as saying.</p> <p>In neighbouring North Ossetia, which is part of the Russian Federation, hundreds of volunteer fighters were mobilising and units of armed Cossacks were poised to join the battle for Tskhinvali.</p>",

But some simple tips to stop you blowing your first loan instalment in Fresher's Week will mean you'll have far more fun raving it up with actual friends for the rest of the year.</p> <p>Don't let the accommodation brochures fool you into picking the wrong hall. Being in the action and living in the city centre might have you frothing at the mouth but bear in mind you'll be paying higher rents. </p> <p>You'll also miss out on all the benefits that come with living in a student \"ghetto\", like Fallowfield in Manchester - more students to share books with, cheap bus passes, cheap drinks in student-friendly bars, a big supermarket and so on. There is a reason that these areas exist and besides, ghetto is in now.</p> <p>The debate over whether to go self-catered or catered is a dead duck. As my friend who lived in Owens Park put it, the food in catered halls is \"disgusting\", and she missed almost every meal. Save rent and learn to cook. At first you'll be draining pasta all over the kitchen floor, but be persist and you'll be watching Gordon Ramsay with a discerning eye. </p> <p>My girlfriend in my final year was a canny woman, but even she didn't discover the prime foundation of cheap and potentially lovely dinners until second year - Sainsbury's Basics (or equivalent) tinned tomatoes. Buy spices, herbs, rice and pasta in bulk and source a market to buy fruit, veg and meat and you can eat like a king or queen on \u00a310 a week.</p> <p>Now where to put all this money you're saving? </p> <p>Don't be dazzled by offers such as free MP3 players or CD vouchers. By far the best freebie offered by the banks is NatWest's five-year 16-25 Railcard. You'll spend so much time on trains visiting friends, going to gigs or going home that you'll grow to love their badly upholstered carriages - especially if you're saving a third on every ticket. </p> <p>Also beware student accounts with huge first year overdraft limits; you will end up spending it all. Instead plump for those that increase year on year. You will thank your lucky stars when you have the money to finance a festival or trip abroad with your new friends come the summer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336353217\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/AnneHuang_SarahLee220.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Huang\" width=\"220\" height=\"355\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Huang.

It's a cosmopolitan hub of vibrancy, a melting pot of cultures, a hotspot for trendsetters and ... wallet destroyingly expensive.</p> <p>However there are a number of ways to make sure your finances are in control for your undergrad years and you don't end up living on a loaf of stale bread waiting for the next instalment of your loan to come through.</p> <p>Accommodation is the most important factor to consider, as it will be the biggest expenditure by far. Luckily for me, my university is one of the few in London offering reasonably priced on-campus housing. I was paying around \u00a398 per week for a decent-sized room with en-suite bathroom, internet connection and daily cleaner but prices vary from \u00a386.45 to \u00a3115.64. </p> <p>However you will have to find your own accommodation for the second and third years and expect to pay around \u00a3500-600 per month for rent.</p> <p>I worked at the Student Union bar and had a great time. You get to meet new people, get free beer and get paid. It's a fantastic way of really getting involved on campus and the wage isn't bad either. I was getting \u00a36.03 per hour and working 4-6 hours a week, but of course you can work more if you wish.</p> <p>The cost of living and studying in London is a lot but the advantages outweigh the cost by a mile. Queen Mary's is located in one of the most vibrant areas, a stone's throw from the ever trendy Shoreditch, Brick Lane, Hoxton, only a few minutes from the centre of the city and bursting with opportunities, so start saving your pennies. </p> <p>If you're lucky you might even get to spot Peaches Geldof - she's starting in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336353218\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/SadeLaja_SarahLee220.jpg\" alt=\"Sade Laja.

Right from the start you have to budget and work out how much money you are going to spend in a week and what you are going to spend it on. I used to spend no more than \u00a320 a week on food from the supermarket and that held me in good stead for three years.</p> <p>Don't be seduced by credit cards. I knew of students running up \u00a31,000 debts in their first semester on cards that banks readily hand out to new unassuming students.</p> <p>Getting a part-time job is the best way to get some extra cash to pay for nights out, food and other expenses.</p> <p>Starting at the beginning of the year a friend of mine started putting all his small change into a jar whenever he had change in his wallet. Midway through the academic year he emptied the jar and found that he had accumulated \u00a330. Although seemingly not a huge amount, he was low on money for food that week and was able to change the money up at the bank. Simple but effective.</p> <p>Another big expense for students is textbooks, which can cost anything up to an eye watering \u00a350 each. The best place to buy is online from Amazon. You can buy used textbooks for half the price and the books are usually in good condition . I'll never forget buying one from a bookshop for \u00a350 in my first year, it still hurts.</p> <p>As a university student, a TV is a luxury, not a must-have item. I was able to last for three years without having one, and I didn't miss it at all. Students still have to pay over \u00a3100 for a TV licence, although a number of students at my university chose not to, and subsequently spent the whole year terrified of being caught.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336353219\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/MaryBabalola_SarahLee220.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Babalola\" width=\"220\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Babalola.

It is also one of the most expensive. </p> <p>If, like me, you are from London then there's no question - you have to live at home, as the only cost-effective way of staying in the capital.</p> <p>You're still entitled to grants and/or student loans, and you'll suffer less stress and fewer disruptions. You won't need to worry about all the problems that come with moving, like noisy halls of residents, deposits, finding flatmates or dodgy landlords. What's more, you have the emotional support of family and established friends and you still get to do all your local activities. </p> <p>But you do miss out on the full student experience. A lot of people will be living in halls so you'll miss out on that communal living experience with other students and making friends.</p> <p>You'll also have less privacy and freedom. You won't be able to get up to as many shenanigans with your parents and/or siblings around. Plus you still have to abide by house rules and take part in family activities. </p> <p>While studying in London, working is a must and is key to keeping your head afloat of your expenses. This is where London has a distinct advantage over other towns as there are a wider variety of jobs and the pay is higher. But I'd recommend you keep an eye on your tax code and claim a refund for any excess tax paid.</p>",
  "<p>The Swedish furniture giant Ikea has thrown the pay-as-you-go mobile market into disarray with the launch of a cheap service.</p> <p>Customers of the sim-only service - you use your existing handset - are rewarded with 9p per minute voice calls to any mobile network, and 6p texts.</p> <p>Ikea is using a company called Family Mobile to provide the service. All the calls are carried over the T-Mobile network.</p> <p>If you want to sign up for the service, officially launched yesterday, you need to join the Ikea Family. Sign-up is free online or at one of its stores. You also get a range of other store-related discounts. </p> <p>The company says customers will need an unlocked handset and you can keep your existing number. Many market stalls will unlock your phone. </p> <p>Users have to spend \u00a310 on the new sim card, but receive \u00a310 worth of calls or texts. There are no restrictions on the number of phones per household.</p> <p>Top-ups are free, although you have to send a chargeable text (6p) to establish your balance. Calls to 0870 numbers cost 12p per minute and to 0845/0844 9p per minute. </p> <p>Roaming is expensive - texts cost 40p from mainland Europe - however, if you want a basic low-cost service, and rarely leave the UK, this looks like a great deal. </p> <p>It will also put pressure on rivals to cut their charges. Tesco's service charges 20p per minute for calls and 10p for texts, and half that for calls and texts to five \"favourite\" numbers. </p> <p>Ikea has given the 9,000 workers in its stores a mobile phone with one of its new sim cards. </p> <p>Jason Baker, of Ikea UK says: \"You can't control the rising costs of petrol, utility bills or food but by being at least 25% cheaper than any other comparable pay-as-you-go offer, Family Mobile can help you take control of your mobile phone costs.\"</p> <p>For more information on how to join the Ikea Family rewards scheme go to <a href=\"http://www.ikea.co.uk/family\">ikea.co.uk/family</a>.

  "<p>Reform of the 500-year-old oath that requires MPs to swear allegiance to the Queen when a new parliament is elected would help bring politicians closer to their constituents and modern realities, the MP campaigning for change said yesterday.</p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, has attracted 21 other signatures, all but one Labour and Lib Dem, to a Commons motion urging colleagues to consider an alternative oath \"to their constituents and the nation\" - and promising to uphold the law rather than the serving monarch.</p> <p>Geoff Hoon, Labour's chief whip, has acknowledged \"a substantial body of opinion in favour of change\" at Westminster. </p> <p>But Baker's proposal was attacked yesterday by the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Tebbit, who called the gesture an attack on the state itself. The Tory MP Geoffrey Cox called it \"uncomprehending constitutional vandalism\".</p> <p>Baker, a parliamentary iconoclast, countered that the recent debate on MPs' pay and expenses is only the latest example of the Commons being out of touch with the public mood. \"I am trying to strengthen the link between MPs and their constituents,\" he said.</p>",
  "<h2>End of the line for \u00a3100m Oyster card contract</h2> <p>The contract to run London's \u00a3100m-a-year Oyster card system is to be terminated in an attempt to save money. Transport for London said it had given notice to TranSys, the consortium running the contract to maintain and develop Oyster cards, used by millions of people to pay for travel in the capital. TfL said the announcement had nothing to do with recent problems that led to ticket barriers at underground stations across the capital being kept open. A statement said mayor Boris Johnson and TfL were convinced a new contract would deliver enhanced services for less money. <br><strong>Matthew Taylor</strong></p> <h2>More time for questioning of shooting suspect</h2> <p>Police were yesterday given more time to question a 19-year-old man over the death of an innocent bystander killed in a convenience store shooting. Ryan Bravo, 18, was shot in the back when he was caught up in an apparent gang fight at a Costcutters in Walworth, south-east London, on Wednesday. Officers were still hunting the two intended victims, who they believe could hold the key to identifying the gunman and his accomplices. The pair rushed into the store to escape the moped-riding gang. A Metropolitan police spokesman said the 19-year-old remained in custody at a South London police station.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Defra backs EU protection for Cumberland sausage</h2> <p>The Cumberland sausage has won government backing for an attempt to join Parma ham and feta cheese as a designated and protected food. An application to Brussels from butchers in Cumbria was endorsed yesterday by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whose previous successful bids include Arbroath smokies and Cornish clotted cream. Coil-shaped Cumberlands have a very high meat content and spices introduced 500 years ago when Whitehaven was Britain's third biggest port. Producers say that poor quality imitations have damaged the real thing.<br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <h2>Judge refused police request to bug McCanns</h2> <p>Portuguese police wanted to bug the parents of missing Madeleine McCann but a judge refused to give permission, their case files have revealed. Police wanted to eavesdrop on the conversations of Gerry and Kate McCann before making the couple formal suspects last summer. Files from the investigation have revealed that on August 1 last year, detectives requested permission to place two bugs in the McCanns' apartment in Praia da Luz and one in their car.

  "<p>Planning a trip with my partner, Harriet, and her parents would not normally cause me sleepless nights. I love them all dearly and we get on extremely well. But this time we were travelling to Israel for the purpose of attending the arranged marriage of a 17-year-old relative. What makes it worse, Israel is a country both Harriet and I have boycotted for nearly two decades, despite the fact that Harriet's brother and his wife and children live there. The bride-to-be is Harriet's niece, Hadara. The groom is a 19-year-old yeshiva [religious] student, Akim, Hadara has met only four times and with whom she has never been alone. Harriet and I are radical feminists, opposed to traditional marriage let alone one arranged by the fathers of the two young people involved. Harriet's parents, Enid and Ernest Wistrich, are secular and deeply critical of the state of Israel. </p> <p>Harriet's younger brother Daniel, the father of the bride, became a religious fundamentalist 15 years ago, much to the distress of his sister and parents. \"When Daniel first told me he had become Hassidic,\" says Ernest, \"I used to wake up in the morning groaning and holding my head in my hands.\" </p> <p>Hassidic men will not touch or even shake hands with any females other than their wife, mother, sister, or daughter. In extreme cases, they will not even look women in the eye. During an evening at Daniel's home during the trip to Israel, I ask him his opinion on this. \"There are some men who can look at a mountain and see a woman,\" he said, \"and men who look at a woman and see a mountain.\" Yes, but why should women be covered up and avoided so that men won't be tempted? \"It is not respectful to the woman to be looked at in that way,\" said Daniel, not answering the question. </p> <p>When Daniel became religious, his mother, accepting the state of affairs reluctantly, had two conditions. \"I told him, do not cut off from your family,\" says Enid, \"and never turn your face away from me or refuse to kiss me.\" </p> <p>Ernest and Enid had three children, but the eldest, Matthew, who was disabled, died aged 14 in 1971. Harriet came next, then Daniel. The Wistrich children grew up in a fairly typical liberal, upper-middle-class household. They lived in Hampstead, north-west London, and were involved in the Woodcraft Folk, the political, peace-loving version of the Brownies or Scouts. </p> <p>Although Daniel and Harriet have had their run-ins, they have a genuine affection for each other. When Daniel comes to our home for dinner, he is the perfect guest. As he is strictly kosher, Daniel is not allowed to eat or drink anything prepared by us so he brings a takeaway from a kosher Chinese, wine and his own disposable coffee-making gadgets. Their father, Ernest, grew up in a well-off, assimilationist family in pre-war Poland, which looked on its large Hassidic community as \"backward\". He came to England shortly before the second world war and caught the last train through Poland before the Nazis invaded. Ernest's mother and sister survived the war by assuming false identities and watched as many relatives perished in the Holocaust. This family history of persecution of the Jews has affected Harriet and Daniel, but whereas Harriet has responded to such horrors on a political level, Daniel has chosen a spiritual path. </p> <p>Harriet, a human rights lawyer and feminist campaigner against sexual violence, has no time for religious fundamentalism, mainly because it exists, she believes, for the main purpose of controlling women. Her mother Enid is a retired academic and local Labour councillor who, in the 1970s, chaired the Greater London Council Film Viewing Board, where she battled it out with Mary Whitehouse over her pro-censorship stance. Enid's 1979 book on film censorship, I Don't Mind the Sex It's the Violence, is a classic liberal text. Daniel, however, does not allow any television in his household lest it corrupts and the only music and reading material allowed are those which have a religious focus.</p> <p>We arrive at Tel Aviv airport the day before the Jewish festival of Purim. The black-hatted, bearded men in their long, black coats are dotted around the airport. Ernest is one of the few Jewish men in our queue for passport control who is not wearing a skull cap and Enid's natural hair contrasts with the wigs sported by the married Orthodox Jewish women. While we are all looking forward to seeing the family, we are dreading what is ahead of us. </p> <p>Daniel moved to Israel in 1987, aged 23. The first time I met him, just weeks after becoming involved with Harriet, he was talking about going to Israel to \"help the Palestinians\". Daniel used to be \"a bit of a hippy\", according to Harriet, and had been involved in anarchism during his university years. \"The rest of the family was involved in politics but Daniel did not find his niche there,\" she says. \"I think he was searching for something that belonged to him.\" </p> <p>Soon after arriving in Israel, he met Zivah, an Iraqi Jew. They married and began experimenting with new age spirituality. Shortly after the birth of Hadara, encouraged by Zivah's brother (a Hassidic Jew) they turned to religion. Daniel is involved in the Hassidic sect known as the Breslov movement, founded by Rabbi Nachman in around 1800. Last year, Daniel made the annual Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage of male Breslovers to Nachman's grave in Uman, Ukraine, where he met the father of his daughter's prospective groom. \"This young man had been mentioned to me by three individuals as someone special who might be a good husband for my daughter,\" says Daniel. \"So I figured God had spoken and arranged to meet his father.\" </p> <p>Breslovs, like other Hassidic Jews, usually meet through matchmakers in a process called a shidduch. There is a vague expectation that a bride and groom should be about the same age, the norm being between 17 and 25. Children are the main rationale of marriage. The average Hassidic family in the UK has eight children. </p> <p>Hadara had a strictly religious, regimented upbringing, in contrast with that of her father and Harriet. By the time she married, Hadara had never been to a cinema, read a non-religious book, kissed a boy, had a glass of wine, or been to a mixed party. </p> <p>We arrive at Daniel's home, in a gated religious community just outside Jerusalem, where Hadara, the bride-to-be, appears ecstatically happy. She tells us about her \"bride classes\". Enid asks what she has learned from the classes: \"How to observe the laws of the Sabbath,\" she says, \"and to know how to run a good kosher home.\" I am dying to ask her what Hadara has been told about sex, but decide that under her parents' watchful gaze it would not go down well. There is no dating in the Hassidic community. Boys and girls are educated and socialised separately. A typical Hassidic boy will never have spoken to any Hassidic girl - aside from his immediate family - before the matching process begins. </p> <p>Arriving early at the wedding venue, we are just in time to find the caterers putting up the screens between the men's and women's sections. There are two top tables, one in each section. The food is flowing, but in the women's section there is no sign of alcohol. Few of the men are drinking, but there is the odd bottle of beer and red wine around and on the top table sits a bottle of whisky among the prayer books. </p> <p>I am introduced to several friends and relatives of the groom. Ernest introduces me as Harriet's partner. While some assume he means we work together, others understand correctly and look profoundly uncomfortable. \"I suppose lesbianism is not exactly the done thing in Daniel's world,\" says Enid, \"but he accepts it in the way that Harriet accepts, to a degree, his belief system.\" </p> <p>In the wedding hall, Harriet and I are mixing the vodka we have brought with us into our soft drinks. Ernest, although trapped in the men's section, has promised to sneak us some wine into the women's section and pass on any juicy gossip. </p> <p>Hadara is sitting on her special bridal seat, surrounded by her friends. They look as they are - a group of giggling, teenage girls. In the men's section, I see Akim, davening [praying] frantically, his body bending and swaying, his prayer book held to his face. The two fathers lead Akim to the chuppa [the canopy traditionally used in Jewish weddings]. He continues to mumble the words of prayers, looking as if he is in some sort of trance. The music is beautiful and haunting. Hadara is brought to the chuppa by the two mothers and a grandmother, a thick veil covering her face, and is walked around the groom seven times as he davens wildly. </p> <p>Harriet and I are separated from her parents in the throng, but afterwards we all agree that the ceremony was unlike anything we had ever witnessed. The atmosphere seemed to be bordering on hysteria and the oddest thing for all of us was being present at the wedding of a relative who is essentially a child. On top of this, Hadara has married a young man none of us knows. </p> <p>Late in the evening, I sneak around the back of the venue and peer through the glass doors to the men's section. The band is in full swing and most of the men are dancing wildly. The groom is being paraded around the hall high above the shoulders of several men, perched on a chair. Back in the women's section, the dancing is somewhat more sedate. Several guests are looking after small children or feeding babies. </p> <p>The day after the wedding, Harriet and I go with a political activist to the West Bank to meet Palestinian human rights groups organising against the apartheid-like conditions in which they are forced to live under punitive Israeli rule. We are both glad to be leaving the country the following day and can't imagine returning. </p> <p>We all agree that the trip, though enjoyable in many ways, has been quite surreal. Enid and Ernest are trying to glean the positives out of the marriage, and are talking about how glowing their granddaughter was at the wedding and what a nice young man Akim seems. Harriet is laughing about the fact that two radical feminist lesbians came all the way to Israel for an arranged marriage when Daniel was forbidden by his rabbi to attend our civil partnership. A few weeks later, Daniel visits London and the family goes out for dinner. \"I was looking over at the two of them laughing and chatting away,\" says Enid, \"and realised that these days they seem to get on better than ever, certainly better than when they were children.\" Having suffered the death of the eldest child and witnessed the remaining two take paths in polarised and conflicting directions, the Wistrichs remain a family to aspire to. I, for one, am proud to be a part of it. </p> <p>Some names have been changed</p>",
  "<p><strong>Gloom busters</strong><br>Following another week filled with yet more economic doom, there was at least one ray of sunshine - the Bank of England's monetary policy committee decided it didn't want to risk the ire of homeowners, and left interest rates unchanged. With inflation threatening to race upwards, there had been gloomy talk of an interest rate rise at Thursday's meeting - one that's passed for this month, at least. </p> <p><strong>...

Hopefully it will make better viewing than the performance of China's investment funds, much-hyped in the run-up to the games. The Chinese stockmarket has done a Fosbury flop in recent months, and was still falling this week. Investors who hoped to cash in on the construction boom leading up to the games have been deeply disappointed.</p> <p>Jupiter's China fund is showing a loss of 20% over the past year, and most of that took place in the last three months. It's a similar story with China-related funds from Melchior, Fidelity, Credit Suisse, HSBC and others. The gold medal for investing in the region goes to Aberdeen Asia Pacific. But it only managed to do well by taking a big bet against China, and points out that it has no plans to change track despite the fact that stocks are now cheaper. </p> <p><strong>Housing boom</strong><br>Weird press release award of the week goes to Defaqto which warns: \"Making biodiesel? - Check your home insurance cover first.\"</p> <p>According to the financial services company, in the face of rising diesel costs more and more people are considering making biodiesel from cooking oil in their garages - and they haven't considered the insurance implications. It went on to cite the example of a man in Northamptonshire who was injured while making biodiesel from cooking oil. He was using an electric drill to mix the oil with ethanol and caustic soda when a spark set off an explosion. He suffered 20% burns and blew up his garage.</p> <p>\"It is apparent then, that if you are intending to make your own biodiesel you should be aware of the dangers involved and the safety implications needed. More importantly though, consideration should be given to whether your home insurance policy will cover any damage caused if an explosion should occur,\" it warns. </p> <p>You can just imagine ringing up the call centre to tell them you plan to start making diesel in your garage, and you'd like to ad this fact to your home insurance policy ...</p>",

But Padilha's follow-up to the hijack doc Bus 174 shouldn't be judged so easily. Focusing on a stressed-out special forces operative charged with keeping the capital's favelas quiet during a visit from the Pope in 1997, Elite Squad is an uncomfortable meditation on the role of the law in a morally skewed society. Yes, the violent Captain Nascimento (Moura) breaks the rules - but how many choices does a principled cop have in a system where bribery is rife and pot-smoking liberals side with drug dealers? Elite Squad doesn't seek to justify such a worldview, but, despite its rough edges and scrappy narrative, it does explain rather grimly how it emerges. </p> <h2>The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor <br>(12A)</h2> <p>(Rob Cohen, 2008, US)<br>Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, Maria Bello. 112 mins.</p> <p>Though it's only the third Mummy movie, this tired family caper feels much older, with Fraser returning as the long-suffering archaeologist to fight a long-dead emperor. </p> <h2>Death Defying Acts (PG)</h2> <p>(Gillian Armstrong, 2007, UK/Aus) <br>Catherine Zeta-Jones, Guy Pearce. 96 mins.</p> <p>Handsome but somewhat empty period romance, with Harry Houdini (Pearce) falling for a phoney psychic (Zeta-Jones) during a visit to Edinburgh in 1926.</p> <h2>Make It Happen (PG)</h2> <p>(Darren Grant, 2008, US)<br>Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Tessa Thompson. 90 mins.

  "<p>My path crossed with that of Sir Peter Kemp <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/03/whitehall.past\">(obituary, July 3) </a>in two key areas: pay negotiations and the Next Steps programme. As chairman of the First Division Association (the top civil servants' union) in the mid-1980s, when Peter headed the Treasury's negotiating team, I sat on the other side of the table. His task was to keep pay awards below inflation, whatever the independent review body had to say. He was uncomfortable arguing the case, but stuck to the Treasury line with good humour and without a trace of the machismo sometimes to be seen. We remained on good personal terms despite the fact that it provoked the first ever industrial action by senior civil servants. </p> <p>In 1989, shortly after Peter was asked by Margaret Thatcher to head the Next Steps initiative to move large tranches of operational work out of the direct control of central government, I became chief executive of an agency that reported to the Treasury. After conducting a review, I recommended that the agency was ripe for Next Steps treatment, but came under pressure to drop it. Peter agreed that my recommendation was valid, but told me about opposition to his work from permanent secretaries across Whitehall, who feared that it would erode their power. Whatever the merits of my case, if the Treasury did not want it to happen, it would prevent it, he said. </p> <p>He was right. I resigned, and my report was quietly buried. I think Whitehall opposition sheds some light on the shabby treatment Peter received a couple of years later, when he was sacked. Whitehall has never known how to handle innovators like Peter; this tends to drive out many talented people.</p> <p><strong>Alan Healey</strong></p>",
  "<p>Hundreds, possibly thousands, of volunteer fighters from Russia were mobilising to enter the war in Georgia's breakaway republic of South Ossetia last night.</p> <p>Units of armed Cossacks from across the North Caucasus region which borders Georgia were poised to join the battle for the separatists' capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In North Ossetia, the region of Russia which shares cultural links and a border with South Ossetia, lists of men willing to fight against Georgian forces were drawn up. Vitaly Khubayev, 35, from the capital, Vladikavkaz, told the Guardian: \"There are already two busloads of fighters leaving for Tskhinvali every day. They give you a uniform on the way and you get issued with weapons once you arrive. If I didn't have three children I'd have gone.\"</p> <p>The two Ossetias are historically inseparable and residents of the northern republic were furious yesterday at what they described as the \"Georgian fascist attack\" on their neighbours.</p> <p>Many said they were willing to take up arms and travel to defend their relatives across the border in South Ossetia. Valentin Tekhti, 67, a teacher, said: \"Our Ossetian brothers are dying. If we get the call, every man who can stand on two legs will go to fight.\" </p> <p>Amiran Khubetsov, a doctor, said: \"A nation is under bombardment in the land it has occupied for hundreds of years. The world must not ignore this aggression.\"</p> <p>At a special meeting of the UN security council yesterday morning, the United States called on the Kremlin to prevent irregulars entering South Ossetia via the 4km Roki tunnel, the republic's only link with Russia. But at a meeting with the US president, George Bush, in Bejing, the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, admitted \"many volunteers\" were heading to South Ossetia and it would be \"very hard to maintain peace\".</p> <p>Under Russia law, Cossacks - the descendants of runaway serfs and outlaws who in the past were employed to protect the country's southern border - are allowed to carry arms and carry out policing functions in cooperation with interior ministry forces.</p> <p>At the headquarters of the Terek Cossacks in Vladikavkaz yesterday a group of men sat under portraits of fierce looking warriors with drooping moustaches watching television coverage of Georgian artillery shelling Tskhinvali. One man said there would be a meeting today to discuss forming volunteer units. </p> <p>In Volgograd the leader of the Don Cossacks, Viktor Vodolatsky, called on all Cossacks under 40 to volunteer. Reports said 100 men from the region had already left for Tskhinvali. \"We must help our South Ossetian brothers,\" he said.</p> <p>Irregular troops from the north Caucasus played an important role in the conflicts that saw both Georgia's breakaway regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, secede in the early 1990s.</p> <p>In Abkhazia, Cossack and Chechen units fought side by side against Georgian troops, despite being historical enemies. Abkhazia has promised to help South Ossetia in its conflict with Georgia.</p> <p>Ossetians in Vladikavkaz yesterday said they were hoping for a decisive strike by the Russian army to drive Georgia's forces out of South Ossetia. There were emotional scenes in the city, as hundreds of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the regional government headquarters and shouted, \"Russia, save us!\"</p> <p>Aelita Dzhioyeva, 41, a lawyer who fled Tskhinvali on Thursday evening, showed text messages on her mobile phone from relatives still sheltering in a basement in the city. One message read: \"We are dying. Ask the government for help.\"</p> <p>Dzhioyeva said: \"Our men will stay and fight until the last drop of blood, but our old people and children must be saved. We are calling on the Kremlin to intervene and create a humanitarian corridor for them to escape.\"</p> <p>Shota Kochiev, 60, said: \"This is America's doing. They are supporting Georgia's mad lust for new land - our land.\"</p> <p>About 2,000 refugees from South Ossetia, mostly women and children, have so far been bussed to Russia and are staying in hotels around Vladikavkaz.</p>",
  "<p>A rival salvo in the battle over biodiversity on grouse moors was fired yesterday by the Moorland Association, which unveiled a 40.5 hectare (100 acre) purple sward of new heather in the Peak District. The hillside overlooking the Snake Pass between Manchester and Sheffield has helped earn its grouse-shooting owner Geoff Eyre an honorary doctorate in moorland restoration ecology from Liverpool University.</p> <p>His purple patch is the association's main weapon this year in the continuing debate over moors management, and the effects on other species of shooting's concentration on grouse. The previously neglected area of the Peak national park recorded a dismal four birds - individuals not species - before Eyre began heather-seeding. Now it has 18 species alongside the red grouse.</p> <p>The moor is near Peak District estates where unexplained deaths of birds of prey have caused friction between grouse-shooting estates and the RSPB.</p> <p>Unexplained deaths of birds of prey have been condemned by the Moorland Association as well as the RSPB, and yesterday association chairman Edward Bromet praised \"the enormous long-term investment\" that grouse moor owners such as Eyre were willing to make. He said that overall, association members had helped restore 405 hectares of heather - around 6% of UK targets to regenerate \"iconic\" heather moorlands.</p>",
  "<p>Serious accident witnesses are notoriously unreliable. There's too much blood, too many angles, too much fear for them to see straight. But despite their confused impressions they're sure of one thing - they've witnessed a catastrophe. It's the details they differ on. </p> <p>Like his first novel, Electricity, Ray Robinson's The Man Without begins with the death of Val O'Connor, a woman we only ever glimpse. For her daughter Lily, narrator of Electricity, Val's death is a relief. Neglectful, sluttish, abusive, Val colluded with her boyfriend Eddie's sexual abuse of her daughter and caused her epilepsy by throwing her down the stairs as a baby. </p> <p>Lily's cousin Antony Dobson, the focus of Robinson's second book, knows nothing of this. For him, Val and Eddie's chaotic home was a childhood refuge from his own neglectful mother. He admired his aunt's brittle strength and there's more than a hint of her extravagant makeup in Antony's alter ego, \"the woman in the mirror\". But despite Lily and Antony's differing perceptions of Val, her death is the catalyst for their separate journeys towards change and the possibility of better lives. The unreliability of memories and their lasting, sometimes damaging, influence is central to both novels. The Man Without's short chapters and snatched paragraphs are evocative of the way in which we remember our lives, not as a single narrative, but as series of events of whose chronology we can't always be sure. </p> <p>Antony's job at the day centre involves \"spoon feeding, being puked on, chair-pushing, hoist lifting, catheter inserting, sticking useless shrivelled cock ends into plastic receptacles\". Add an ex-girlfriend who left because of his transvestism, an ex-gangster father who started a fresh life with his shiny new family in Spain, a mother who threw him out, and Antony's depression begins to seem perfectly reasonable. But is it?</p> <p>Antony certainly thinks so. He blames his addiction to autoerotic asphyxiation on his lesbian mother's cure for sleep walking (she tied him to the bed at night), and his transvestism on her sexuality. He loves the woman he conjures in the mirror, but despises himself for needing to create her. Like his cousin's epilepsy, his cross dressing is a ruling stigma, a detested fault line, a self-definition of failure. </p> <p>On his way to Val's funeral Antony impulsively jumps on a random train, which takes him to a small town where he meets beautiful, middle-class Jade. Like Antony, Jade's fond of a good drink, a few lines, pills, fags and joints. Unlike him, she's confident, healthily promiscuous and looking forward to university. Jade's secure family background seems to hold the key. As Milton put it: \"Childhood shows the man, as morning shows the day.\" But perhaps weather was more stable in Milton's time and people less willing to change. </p> <p>Robinson confronts us with lives blighted by tortured childhoods, but never drifts into the pornography of suffering. His characters may initially believe the key to their adult difficulties lies in the bits they can't quite remember, but by relating The Man Without to his first novel Robinson demonstrates the non-existence of single truths. His witnesses don't speak with the authority of a misery memoirist. They are unreliable because they were children, with children's limited understanding, when the mistreatment that continues to inform their lives took place. Despite this, they're sure of one thing. However hazy the details, they know they were involved in a catastrophe. And slowly they come to realise that the way to recovery isn't behind them, it lies ahead.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Louise Welsh's novels include The Bullet Trick (Canongate)</p>",
  "<p>I was asked recently why I called a particular character \"Rowan\" - was it for the tree? The woman who asked the question is into what you might call spiritual botany - which I am not - and somehow, this meant I had to give her a practical answer, because although creativity can be a mysterious force, it is also an ordinary business of putting things together and hoping they will stick. </p> <p>The Rowan in question is a small boy who appears at the end of my last novel, The Gathering. He has, or I hope he has, a kind of iconic or uncanny quality. So I said that, yes, I took the name from the tree and yes, I am aware it was considered a magical tree, and a protective one in the Celtic tradition, and that this mattered a little, though not as much as the simple fact that the tree is native to Ireland. As a name, Rowan has modern, slightly hippyish overtones; it is sometimes chosen over the Gaelic \"Rohan\", and both these facts suited my purposes very well. </p> <p>Checking my notes, I found that the little trees in the asylum graveyard that features in the book were rowans, and this synchronicity was very satisfying to me. Finally, I have met a couple of Rowans, both children, and they are both pretty fab. So yes, he was named for the tree. Sort of. But there was no magic to the naming - or not the kind of magic that my questioner was into. I chose this name for reasons poetical, tribal, sociological, personal and arbitrary. I chose this name because he is a beautiful little boy whose extended family look at him as though they had never seen a child before.</p> <p>\"Rowan,\" they say. \"Rowan?\" </p> <p>Naming is nice. It took me days before I was able to speak a name for my first child (what if people did not like it?), and I suspect we gave her a secret, second name as well, to keep her safe. Of course, we did no such thing. We just put a word on this new human creature and used it freely and easily, the way you do. We told it to the government. We bandied it about. By the time the second child was named, we had steeled ourselves into a state of insouciance. </p> <p>Naming characters is much less fraught - you know a lot more about your characters than you do about your babies, for a start. I use a dictionary of names that I bought many years ago, trying not to look pregnant at the till. I also have a dictionary of Irish surnames, to check the provenance and the meaning of a particular family name. I use the phone book, and I ask people, all the time, where their name comes from, which in some societies, particularly multicultural ones, is considered rude. I hope I am not rude, but I do want to know their story - surnames can tell you about wealth or class, but more usually they speak of movements and migrations, both ancient and modern. </p> <p>In more static societies, like Ireland, you can tell where a person is from by their surname, or where their grandparents are from. So provincial, I know; so ugly, when you use it to guess their religion (but I like doing that, too). The information a name contains is both private and general. It intimates much, but it doesn't mean a goddamn thing - as any Catholic called Billy will be quite happy to tell you. </p> <p>If surnames yield history, first names give us love stories: they speak of the family mythology, the kind of person your parents hoped you might become. It is important to keep this element of hope when you name a character. It is important to keep your creation open, though it is a brave writer who leaves them entirely blank (by calling his protagonist John, for example, or even \"K\"). A funky name can add various things to a character. I might ramp one up for poetic resonance, another writer will do it for satirical effect. All of which has to be done with care. </p> <p>Though John means nothing and Paul means very little, John Paul will be a Catholic (religion again) born in the early 1980s; he will also possibly be working class. The more socially legible the name, the more satirical the book (or proud, sometimes), and the less the name is of use to me. Contempt or pride are not emotions I have about the people I create. That is not what I create them for. I create them to see what they will do.</p> <p>So. </p> <p>There he is. I can see him - if I stay still long enough. What I have first is a glimpse; a flicker of emotion. I know what this child does to the people around him. I spend some time trying to decide on a name, and meanwhile, by sleight, I steal some details; the colour of his hair and - goodness yes - his blue eyes. There he is. The child has turned around. What he wears is up to me, I dress him myself. No, not lace-up shoes - cute but too impractical - he wears sneakers with lycra fastenings. He keeps changing size, though - like ET in the movie - the proportions shift, depending on where, and how important, he is in the scene.</p> <p>\"Where do you get your ideas from?\" - that is one of the great questions. To which the answer may be that there is a problem in the book, and this problem becomes a door. Through this door walks the necessary thing - in this case a child, or the sense of a child. If I stay very still, I will realise how much I already know about this human being, the rest I just make up. In between that first gift and the cutting and pasting that follows, comes the name. </p> <p>It is one of the reasons I like signing books. \"What's your name?\" I say. I am always happy to sign for a Bernadette - named for the film The Song of Bernadette, and born in 1943. Your average Martina is born in 1961, Dolores may indeed have a sad tale to tell, Saffria will confirm that her parents were a bit nuts, but John Paul - well he will seldom declare himself. He is 28, he is buying the book for his girlfriend, or worse, his mother, and \"What's her name?\" I say.</p>",

  "<p>Re Revenge (July 26), I have just finished an autobiographical book, Siegfried And His Uncles, where I seek to discover the involvement of my Austrian family in the Third Reich. From documents in Berlin and archives of the former GDR, I found that one member of my wider family was the right-hand man of the commandant of the extermination camp at Chelmno. The commandant appeared to enjoy shooting prisoners, ordered his SS men to do the same and even invited the commandant of the ghetto of Lodz to join him in a kind of shooting party. </p> <p>At the end of the war, he went west and took my uncle with him, thus saving him from the fate of some of his SS colleagues who were left in Poland, tried and executed. In the end the commandant was captured by the English. One report stated that he committed suicide in prison. Another report, however, says he was assassinated as one of the most notorious criminals of the Nazi regime. He was third on the list of victims of the Jewish revenge group. No doubt Jonathan Freedland's book will throw more light on this, too. My uncle ended up hidden by his cousins who were, I presume, unsuspecting of his role in the Holocaust. After a year he disappeared and when his body was found half-decayed in a river, he was believed to have committed suicide.<br><strong>Lothar Huber </strong><br>Brighton, East Sussex</p> <p>\"Plenty of people have said, 'I love you' and not meant it.

  "<p>Recent legislation allows couples to eliminate the cancer gene when a child is conceived. This new ruling created a dilemma for our family. We had previously agreed that there would be no need to worry the younger members about our family cancer until about their late 20s, unless they themselves raised the subject. </p> <p>The picture was now quite different. Any affected family member could now choose to avoid having a pregnancy that would result in a baby who had inherited our family's cancer gene. Naturally, my four nephews and nieces aged 18-22 could only make decisions about this if they were fully informed well before their first pregnancy. </p> <p>I also wrote a paper that could be given to each of them if appropriate. I thought it might be easier to have the information applicable directly to our own family circumstances. This is it: </p> <p>\"For most people who get cancer, it occurs without warning, seemingly out of the blue. However, a small proportion of cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancer, do run in some families and are associated with particular genes. BRCA1, a breast cancer gene, is one of these and runs in the Bryan family. It can be inherited and passed on, by either male or female members. Children whose mother or father carries the cancer gene will have a 50:50 chance of inheriting the gene. </p> <p>\"As this cancer only involves breasts and ovaries, it rarely affects men. Nor had there, until recently, been any way of knowing whether a man had inherited the cancer gene unless one of his daughters developed that kind of cancer. Grandpa's mother, Silver Bryan, and your great-aunt, Grandpa's sister, Sylvia Wevill, developed cancer of the ovary. So did a number of more distant cousins. However, we did not know whether Grandpa had inherited the cancer gene until Bunny got cancer of the ovary. Soon after that, it became possible to positively identify the gene through a blood test. Felicity and I then arranged to have this blood test and found that we too, like Bunny, were positive. </p> <p>\"If a woman has the cancer gene, she will not necessarily develop cancer. There is, however, about an 80% chance that she will do so at some stage in life unless she takes action to avoid it. At what age the cancer appears can vary widely. In our family, no one has had it before they were 40. </p> <p>\"Felicity and I had our ovaries removed once we knew we didn't want, or couldn't have, any more children. Unfortunately, Felicity later developed breast cancer. Luckily, this was caught early and treated. I avoided getting ovarian or breast cancer by having everything at risk removed. Whether the cancer in my pancreas is related to our BRCA1 family gene is not known. It is apparently quite rare. </p> <p>\"Some people prefer not to find out whether they have the gene. Clearly, such people will not want to have the test. Others think it helps to know. </p> <p>\"If, for example, the test proves negative, you can feel reassured and needn't worry any more about it. If you find you do carry the gene, a number of things can be done to prevent any danger of the cancer becoming a serious problem. </p> <p>\"Women can have frequent screenings of ovaries and breast by ultrasound to detect any cancer as early as possible. Ovaries are more difficult to screen than breasts, so to be (almost) completely safe, ovaries probably need to be removed by your early 40s. </p> <p>\"As both Felicity and Bunny carried the gene, all four of you have a 50:50 chance of carrying it too. You could all be negative and therefore in the clear. But, equally, you could all have the bad luck of carrying it. The most likely situation is that some of you will have it and others not. </p> <p>\"Until this year, there has been no hurry for you even to think about the chances. Even if you were found to be positive, there was nothing that needed to be done or even considered until your late 30s. </p> <p>\"The situation has now changed. If you carry the cancer gene, it is now possible to avoid passing it on to any child you may have. A child conceived by someone who carries the cancer gene, either in an egg or a sperm, has a 50:50 chance of inheriting that gene. You all four, therefore, need at least to know about this new option before you think of getting pregnant. </p> <p>\"You can avoid having a child with the cancer gene by taking advantage of a new procedure - Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, or PGD. This is done using IVF, in vitro fertilisation, or the \"test tube\" method. After several eggs have been collected from the woman and fertilised by sperm, the resulting embryos can be tested for the gene. Only an embryo that is negative for the cancer gene would be transferred to the womb. Many people will not want to even consider PGD, but it is important that you at least know what options are available. Over the next 20 years, there are likely to be many improvements in the detection and treatment of cancer and the chance of dying will certainly decrease. By how much and when, unfortunately no one can say.\" </p> <p>All four took the information seriously, but without undue alarm. Their first reaction was that they would probably go ahead and be tested when practicable. They all understood about the option of PGD and embryo selection. </p> <p>We of the older generation needed to remind ourselves of the importance of confidentiality. The young all know that their parents and I are happy to talk about any concerns they may have. But the decisions they are to make are theirs, not ours. This applies not only to what they decide and do, but also to what they reveal and to whom. </p> <p>For a family that talks openly about personal matters, this will require restraint from us. We should not inquire about their plans. They have a right to choose how much they reveal and to whom. And we have no right to expect or request more.</p>",
  "<p>Jason Lewry's regular hints at retirement have become something of a joke in Sussex, so nobody is surprised that the 37-year-old left-arm seamer has again suggested that this could be his last season. However his performance in Manchester this week has proven that even after five knee operations, he remains a highly useful performer.</p> <p>It was Lewry who put the champions on top right from the start of the match by reducing Lancashire to 16 for three on the first morning. Yesterday he was at it again, taking three more wickets including the prize scalp of Stuart Law to keep Sussex on course for a victory that would preserve their hopes of retaining the title.</p> <p>Law, who has hit seven centuries against Sussex in as many seasons with Lancashire, played an admirable captain's knock after coming in at 14 for two and quickly losing night watchman Gary Keedy to a perfect Lewry yorker. In Luke Sutton, he finally found a partner with the technique to offer sustained support against the varied Sussex attack, and their stand of 67 steered Lancashire to 181 for six - with a lead of 71 - shortly before tea.</p> <p>However Chris Adams threw the ball to Lewry, who induced Law into a rare and fatal error, a loose chip that the debutant Michael Thornely pouched safely at cover. In the next over Sutton poked a bat-pad catch to give Mushtaq Ahmed his first wicket of the innings, and Lancashire were back in the mire.</p> <p>Dominic Cork and Glen Chapple counter-attacked with a stand of 78 in 12 overs, Cork launching Ollie Rayner for two leg-side sixes in the space of four balls before he fell for 43 from 36 balls, going for another big hit off Mushtaq. Chapple battled on to a 59 ball half-century and it took the unusual dismissal of Sagid Mahmod, run out at the non-striker's end after Lewry deflected Chapple's straight drive, to bring the innings to an end - setting Sussex a target of 176 to win.</p> <p>Earlier Robin Martin-Jenkins, who has formed an effective new-ball partnership with Lewry, had Paul Horton caught at slip with a beauty. Rayner added two wickets to the five he collected in the first innings - Iain Sutcliffe caught off bat and pad and Steven Croft making a horrible error by offering no stroke to a ball that pitched well outside off stump and turned behind his backside to hit middle and leg.</p>",
  "<p>For many people the sight of Russian tanks streaming across a border in August has uncanny echoes of Prague 1968. That cold war reflex is natural enough, but after two decades of Russian retreat from those bastions it is misleading. Not every development in the former Soviet Union is a replay of Soviet history.</p> <p>The clash between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia, which escalated dramatically yesterday, in truth has more in common with the Falklands war of 1982 than it does with a cold war crisis. When the Argentine junta was basking in public approval for its bloodless recovery of Las Malvinas, Henry Kissinger anticipated Britain's widely unexpected military response with the comment: \"No great power retreats for ever.\" Maybe today Russia has stopped the long retreat to Moscow which started under Gorbachev.</p> <p>Back in the late 1980s, as the USSR waned, the red army withdrew from countries in eastern Europe which plainly resented its presence as the guarantor of unpopular communist regimes. That theme continued throughout the new republics of the deceased Soviet Union, and on into the premiership of Putin, under whom Russian forces were evacuated even from the country's bases in Georgia.</p> <p>To many Russians this vast geopolitical retreat from places which were part of Russia long before the dawn of communist rule brought no bonus in relations with the west. The more Russia drew in its horns, the more Washington and its allies denounced the Kremlin for its imperial ambitions.</p> <p>Unlike in eastern Europe, for instance, today in breakaway states such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia, Russian troops are popular. Vladimir Putin's picture is more widely displayed than that of the South Ossetian president, the former Soviet wrestling champion Eduard Kokoity. The Russians are seen as protectors against a repeat of ethnic cleansing by Georgians.</p> <p>In 1992, the west backed Eduard Shevardnadze's attempts to reassert Georgia's control over these regions. The then Georgian president's war was a disaster for his nation. It left 300,000 or more refugees \"cleansed\" by the rebel regions, but for Ossetians and Abkhazians the brutal plundering of the Georgian troops is the most indelible memory.</p> <p>Georgians have nursed their humiliation ever since. Although Mikheil Saakashvili has done little for the refugees since he came to power early in 2004 - apart from move them out of their hostels in central Tbilisi to make way for property development - he has spent 70% of the Georgian budget on his military. At the start of the week he decided to flex his muscles.</p> <p>Devoted to achieving Nato entry for Georgia, Saakashvili has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan - and so clearly felt he had American backing. The streets of the Georgian capital are plastered with posters of George W Bush alongside his Georgian protege. George W Bush avenue leads to Tbilisi airport. But he has ignored Kissinger's dictum: \"Great powers don't commit suicide for their allies.\" Perhaps his neoconservative allies in Washington have forgotten it, too. Let's hope not.</p> <p>Like Galtieri in 1982, Saakashvili faces a domestic economic crisis and public disillusionment. In the years since the so-called Rose revolution, the cronyism and poverty that characterised the Shevardnadze era have not gone away. Allegations of corruption and favouritism towards his mother's clan, together with claims of election fraud, led to mass demonstrations against Saakashvili last November. His ruthless security forces - trained, equipped and subsidised by the west - thrashed the protesters. Lashing out at the Georgians' common enemy in South Ossetia would certainly rally them around the president, at least in the short term.</p> <p>Last September, President Saakashvili suddenly turned on his closest ally in the Rose revolution, defence minister Irakli Okruashvili. Each man accused his former blood brother of mafia links and profiting from contraband. Whatever the truth, the fact that the men seen by the west as the heroes of a post-Shevardnadze clean-up accused each other of vile crimes should warn us against picking a local hero in Caucasian politics.</p> <p>Western geopolitical commentators stick to cold war simplicities about Russia bullying plucky little Georgia. However, anyone familiar with the Caucasus knows that the state bleating about its victim status at the hands of a bigger neighbour can be just as nasty to its smaller subjects. Small nationalisms are rarely sweet-natured.</p> <p>Worse still, western backing for \"equip and train\" programmes in Russia's backyard don't contribute to peace and stability if bombastic local leaders such as Saakashvili see them as a guarantee of support even in a crisis provoked by his own actions. He seems to have thought that the valuable oil pipeline passing through his territory, together with the Nato advisers intermingled with his troops, would prevent Russia reacting militarily to an incursion into South Ossetia. That calculation has proved disastrously wrong.</p> <p>The question now is whether the conflict can be contained, or whether the west will be drawn in, raising the stakes to desperate levels. To date the west has operated radically different approaches to secession in the Balkans, where pro-western microstates get embassies, and the Caucasus, where the Caucasian boundaries drawn up by Stalin, are deemed sacrosanct.</p> <p>In the Balkans, the west promoted the disintegration of multiethnic Yugoslavia, climaxing with their recognition of Kosovo's independence in February. If a mafia-dominated microstate like Montenegro can get western recognition, why shouldn't flawed, pro-Russian, unrecognised states aspire to independence, too?</p> <p>Given its extraordinary ethnic complexity, Georgia is a post-Soviet Union in miniature. If westerners readily conceded non-Russian republics' right to secede from the USSR in 1991, what is the logic of insisting that non-Georgians must remain inside a microempire which happens to be pro-western?</p> <p>Other people's nationalisms are like other people's love affairs, or, indeed, like dog fights. These are things wise people don't get involved in. A war in the Caucasus is never a straightforward moral crusade - but then, how many wars are?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Almond is a history lecturer at Oriel College, Oxford <a href=\"mailto:mpalmond@aol.com\">mpalmond@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>More than three months have passed since Leicester City were relegated into the third tier for the first time, but Milan Mandaric remains in a state of shock. The former Portsmouth chairman wants to believe \"this is all a bad dream\" but at 3pm today, when he takes his seat to watch Leicester face Milton Keynes Dons in League One as his old club prepare to take on Manchester United in the Charity Shield at Wembley tomorrow, reality will bite.</p> <p>It is an opening-day fixture guaranteed to shock as Mandaric and Leicester seek to come to terms with their chastening fall from grace. Returning to the Premier League, rather than slipping into League One, was what the Leicester chairman had in mind when he took over last year and talked about his plans to get the club out of the Championship as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Six managers and 18 months later and Mandaric is putting on a brave face, the 69-year-old claiming \"this can be a new era for the club\" as he plots the 46 matches he expects to culminate in promotion. It promises to be a new experience if nothing else, with the fixture list about as appealing as an interview with the City of London Police, something that Mandaric also experienced in a season he describes as \"terrible\".</p> <p>The eve of a season is traditionally a time for optimism, however, and Mandaric, to his credit, is not about to start moaning as he looks ahead to upcoming trips to Stockport, Cheltenham and Leyton Orient. \"Leicester were a big club but right now we're as good as our standing,\" said the Serbia-born businessman. \"You don't go for caviar and champagne in the boardroom in League One, but there is nothing wrong with fish and chips.</p> <p>\"I'm a very normal guy. I didn't start with a silver spoon, whether that was business or football. I have respect for League One clubs and look forward to meeting them. The Premier League is the most powerful league in the world but the Premier League would be nowhere if you didn't have smaller clubs, so there is nothing wrong with being there and earning your way up. We have to show we are the team who we think we are.\"</p> <p>Mandaric needs success as much as anyone. Having hired and fired so many managers in such a short space of time, there is a feeling that if the chairman gets it wrong again it will be his head and not Nigel Pearson's on the block. Will the fans turn on him next? \"Probably,\" admitted Mandaric, who fears people will forget he \"bailed out the club financially\" when he took control. \"If it did happen, it would be a horrible situation. </p> <p>\"I'm always on the edge doing this. I'm going to be the greatest chairman in the world, like at Portsmouth where fans cheered my name until the last minute, or I will be a loser. And I know I'm not a loser. After relegation people said, 'Why do you need it?' But I'm not a guy who leaves people in trouble. If I was part of it, I want to be there to correct it. Also, 11,000 [season-ticket holders] feel the same way, they're not running away from this club.\"</p> <p>How Leicester have got into this mess is something Mandaric has considered over the summer. While he accepts at the outset he was \"ill-advised in a lot of areas\" and feels that Martin Allen was \"the wrong choice\", the chairman also curses bad luck. Gary Megson was not a popular appointment but Mandaric thinks Leicester would have reached the play-offs had Bolton not poached him.</p> <p>Mandaric also regrets his decision to keep faith with Ian Holloway for as long as he did and believes they would have survived had he sacked the former Plymouth manager with 10 games to go, something he was on the verge of doing before an unexpected victory at West Bromwich. \"Ian meant well,\" said Mandaric. \"But if you look back, he brought in too many players.\"</p> <p>Holloway harboured similar concerns about Mandaric and had claimed during his time in charge he wanted to \"stop all these agents ringing my chairman\". The comment does not sit comfortably with Mandaric. \"I have never, ever told any one of my managers - and I've had a lot of them during my time in England, France, Belgium and America - 'I want you to take this player',\" said Mandaric. \"I might tell him, 'This agent called me about this player, what do you think about him?'.\"</p> <p>Agents and transfers are a pertinent subject. Last November Mandaric was arrested as part of the investigation into corruption and although no charges have been brought, he has yet to be cleared. \"If you're asking what is my most disappointing moment, it was that one, because I thought I was a good honest chairman when I was at Portsmouth. I have never in my life been involved in any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\"When you are part of high-profile businesses worldwide, it's certainly hard to explain to my associates that I have nothing to do with this here. I think I'm extremely unlucky I got mentioned. They said 'We're after an agent who was giving money to the player.' What has that got to do with the club? The contract was given to the FA and we sent the money [to the agent]. What he is going to do with the money is not our business.\"</p> <p>It would be understandable if Mandaric's frustrations extended to seeing Portsmouth winning the FA Cup but he insists he has no regrets at leaving Fratton Park. \"In 12 months there will be light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said. \"And this time the light will not be a train coming.\"</p> <h2>Giants who fell this far</h2> <p><strong>Leeds United 2007 to present</strong></p> <p>The Elland Road club have just completed their first ever season in the third tier. . . they are now preparing for their second</p> <p><strong>Nottingham Forest 2005-08</strong></p> <p>Became the first European Cup-winning team ever to tumble into the third tier and spent three seasons there before going up last season after a final-day 3-2 win over Yeovil</p> <p><strong>Sheffield Wednesday 2003-2005</strong></p> <p>Wednesday endured two seasons in League One before going up, under the guidance of Paul Sturrock, after a 4-2 play-off win over Hartlepool 4-2 in the play-off final.

  "<p>A lack of team support has been Nicole Cooke's bugbear in major events in the past but that should not be an issue in tomorrow's Olympic road race here. On the other hand, the rapid progress made this year by the newcomers Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws means that Cooke can no longer take team leadership for granted; instead Great Britain go into the 77-mile race with three possible medallists.</p> <p>\"We are not having a single team leader. All the women are there by right, there is not one athlete streets ahead of the others, so our strategy is to ride a strong team race,\" said the team's performance manager, Shane Sutton, who will be in the support car devising tactics with the team manager Julian Winn as the race unfolds.</p> <p>Cooke will be the most fancied of the trio due to her huge experience in major events: a silver and two bronze medals in world road championships and the Commonwealth Games title in 2002. However, Pooley managed a top-10 placing in last year's world road race and became the only British woman to win a World Cup round this season when she won the Binda Trophy in Italy in March and Laws has performed above expectations in major races this year.</p> <p>Based on recent form, the diminutive climber Pooley should be the sharpest, having dominated her final warm-up event, a stage race in Brittany. Cooke did not race there, having elected to travel to Tuscany to train on her own. In the national championships at the end of June it was Pooley who looked stronger than Cooke, although the Welsh woman still managed to outsprint her at the finish.</p> <p>The Kenyan-born Laws was an unknown until this season, with a background in tough cycle touring and mountain-bike events when she made the move from Australia to Britain, and she is understood to have regained her form despite a minor fracture in her ankle in a training accident in early June.</p> <p>She had less than two weeks off her bike but in late July, when the British held a media day at the Newport velodrome, she could be seen with her foot raised and an ice pack on the ankle. She has not raced since, although she posted a promising time in a 10-mile time-trial before the British team flew out.</p> <p>\"We are in with a really good shout; we have three women who can race well but they will have to take their chances,\" said Sutton. \"Sometimes having three possible leaders can work against you because you don't have any committed team workers but, given the nature of the course, which should see a lot of the field fall away, we could have a big presence in the front group. Not many teams have that strength in numbers.\"</p> <p>Sutton and the GB cycling performance director, Dave Brailsford, hope that the three women will between them cover every escape of any significance, unlike in Athens, when Cooke was on her own in the decisive lead group of seven. Then she had no option but to lead the chase when Sara Carrigan of Australia and Judith Arndt of Germany escaped; she came close to crashing on one corner, and ended up third in the sprint for the bronze medal.</p> <p>\"I think perhaps we have one of the strongest teams on the start line,\" was Cooke's verdict. \"With a team around you, you can cover everything. If we can put the other teams on the defensive, so they are reacting to our game plan, hopefully one of us can pull it off.\"</p> <p>According to Sutton, the course will also suit the big favourite for the event, Holland's Marianne Vos, the 21-year-old who pipped Cooke for last year's overall title in the World Cup. With gold medal chances tomorrow, in the road time-trial and in the points race on the track, the 2006 world champion is set to be Holland's biggest star of the Games.</p> <p>Much has been made of the seven-mile climb that is tackled twice after the run-out from Beijing to the circuit. It should be suited to the climbing talents of the British trio. Sutton feels the descent will give the field time to recover but that the finish next to the Great Wall, 25 miles outside the city, will be ideal for Cooke.</p> <p>\"Nicole likes the course and she likes the finish. With 500m to go you go round a bend and it comes at you, it levels off, then boots up again. If it was a sheer speed finish Nicole might struggle a little bit but it's more of a finish for a strong rider and it could play into her hands.\"</p>",

  "<p>SEGA, \u00a35.99</p> <p>The monkeys haven't changed - you still choose among AiAi, Gongon and friends - and neither has the transparent ball in which they roll around a series of mazes suspended over a bottomless precipice. The big change here is that rather than using an analogue joystick to tilt the maze delicately in the right direction to steer your monkey of choice around increasingly testing holes, ramps and obstacles, you simply tilt your iPhone. Initially confusing in that flat (ie the position in which your monkey stops rolling) is actually very slightly angled towards you for better visibility, it quickly becomes clear what the game wants you to do: use microscopically fine movements to guide your simian friend to its goal. Total lack of camera control is a problem, as is the movement of public transport, which will happily pitch the most cautiously rolled monkeys into infinity thanks to inconsiderate braking on the bus or train. Despite these small failings, iPhone Monkey Ball is an elegantly rendered handheld game with remarkably effective controls. </p>",

Doctors have likened the cocktails to \"a small bomb that goes off in the brain\". </p> <p>In letters to the country's interior, finance and development ministries and leaked to the press this week, tourism minister Aris Spiliotopoulos described the drinks as a menace that threatened to bring Greece into disrepute. </p> <p>He urged the government to not only set up special \"anti-bomba\" patrols but to allow places of entertainment to undergo control-checks late into the night. </p> <p>\"Until now officials have only been able to conduct such checks until 2pm which is a bit of a paradox when it's clearly such a big issue,\" added Nova.</p> <p>\"With these new rules, they'll be able to go into bars at any time of the night and day.\" </p> <p>Chemists at state-run laboratories, as well as food control officials, will be seconded to the drive. </p> <p>\"It's all part of our effort to discourage the wild behaviour that, sadly, is often encouraged by tour operators in Britain,\" she said. \"We're not interested in quantity but the quality of tourism in Greece.\" </p> <p>The campaign comes as authorities intensified a crackdown on alcohol-fuelled tourists running amok in resorts nationwide. </p> <p>Many young Britons, often enjoying their first unsupervised holiday abroad, were arrested this week on Crete. </p> <p>The arrests followed an \"urgent order\" by the island's leading prosecutor, Nikos Markakis, for emergency services to settle the \"uncontrollable situation\" in Malia, a retreat that caters almost exclusively to young UK holidaymakers and where exasperated locals last year staged protest demonstrations. </p> <p>Since the start of the tourist season bad behaviour has reached new heights with Britons being rounded up for having sex in public, possessing counterfeit euro bank notes and staging drunken rampages through the town. </p> <p>With authorities showing a new resolve to stop the antics, British tour companies yesterday advised people \"to respect local laws\" in resorts that not that long ago were quiet Greek fishing villages.</p>",
  "<p>\"They've been fighting 2,000 years,\" Adam Sandler's mother says of the Israelis and the Palestinians in <strong>You Don't Mess With The Zohan</strong>. \"It can't be much longer.\" Don't count on it, Mama Zohan. The fight goes on, even at the movies this week, when The Zohan goes head-to-head with Jimmy Carter, much-scorned and vilified author of Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, b\u00eate noire of the American right (their stance satirised by Squeaky-Voiced Teen in The Simpsons saying of Carter, \"But he's history's greatest monster!\"), and now the subject of Jonathan Demme's new documentary, <strong>Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains</strong></p> <p>They certainly make a fine pair, the ex-Mossad agent-turned-granny-shagging Brooklyn hairdresser and accidental broker of an Israeli-Palestinian accord on the street where he cuts heads, and the decent, idealistic, faintly saintly, albeit politically luckless ex-president whose unimpeachable patriotism and sanity Fox News never misses an opportunity to slander or slur. </p> <p>In the Sandler movie, gross-out humour and silly fight sequences come larded with a touchingly sentimental faith in the ability of ancient antagonists to bury that 2,000-year-old hatchet, but also with a determined and often admirable willingness to take the piss out of both sides of an issue that most people don't find one bit funny. So it's worth giving Sandler, a relatively liberal Republican, some respect for even daring to grasp this nettle in Hollywood, an industry town founded by partially assimilated Jews who for decades shied away from dealing with anything vaguely thematically or politically Jewish, particularly during the 1930s and 40s, when it might really have counted for something. </p> <p>That being said, however, The Zohan, although a cut above most Sandler comedies, remains an inch-deep political cop-out of a movie, settling in the end for wishy-washy can't-we-all-get-along-isms alongside the same sentimentality and small-C, blue-collar conservatism that afflicts all his work. For an idea of the forces that stand in the way of a glib, happy (Madison) ending like Zohan's, just check out the endlessly creepy lawyer and political commentator Alan Dershowitz sliming Jimmy Carter's position in Man From Plains. Or the pitched battle that briefly erupts between Arab and Israeli partisans outside one of the many Carter book signings that Demme covers. Or the kneejerk radio hosts who find out to their cost that they should have read Carter's book before trying to take him down, and who end up slashed and bleeding from the ex-prez's lacerating rhetorical demolitions.</p> <p>It's hard to convey to non-Americans how energetically the American right despises Carter. You'd think having Reagan kick his ass electorally in 1980 might have slaked their bloodlust, but no, they still can't get enough of kicking this octogenarian, a man whose warnings 30 years ago about America's crippling oil dependency went entirely unheeded by his senile successor. And look at us now.</p>",
  "<p>It's no secret that finding the right job after completing a PhD can be problematic. Some research students find that years spent breaking new ground in their chosen field ill equips them for the competitive job market they now need to negotiate. </p> <p>One of the main problems is how to make yourself stand out from the crowd among a sea of candidates who all hold the same qualifications. One answer may be to re-think the method of obtaining a PhD. </p> <p>An option increasingly seen as the smart alternative for research students keen to secure high-profile positions is to study for a PhD by prospective publication. Already popular in Europe, this method involves writing a series of shorter papers, rather than one thesis, which are then accepted and published in peer-reviewed journals, immediately offering kudos to its author and adding weight to a slimline CV. </p> <p>\"A PhD is essentially an apprenticeship in research and one of the key skills for successfully completing research is writing papers for publication, which can be difficult to master,\" says Professor Jonathan Elford of City University's department of public health, which offers PhD students the publication option.</p> <p>Completing a PhD by thesis usually involves writing a huge tome of about 200-300 pages, which is then only read by a research supervisor and examiners, with very few others having the opportunity to see it. This means that many PhD students simply aren't trained to turn their research findings into the valuable short, succinct papers that are published in peer-reviewed journals that can kickstart any academic's career. </p> <p>\"Doing a PhD by prospective publication means you start to generate papers about your research straightaway and it also helps your CV to stand out when it comes to getting a job,\" Elford says.</p> <p>He is confident the UK will follow other countries and that this method of obtaining a PhD will become widespread in a few years' time. \"In large parts of Europe, completing a PhD on prospective publication is the standard way of doing things,\" he says. \"It makes sense as people get a chance to acquire transferable skills for their future careers while they are completing important research.\"</p> <p>Elford is Sarah Dougan's PhD supervisor and explains how the nature of her research was well suited to this kind of doctorate. Dougan, 29, began her part-time PhD looking into HIV incidence and prevalence in gay men in the UK in January 2004, while she was working at the Health Protection Agency, and is expected to complete it by the end of this year. </p> <p>\"Although I have worked throughout my PhD I've found through experience that a lot of job applications ask for your publication history. So if you have a PhD and a bank of published papers it is quite useful and I think it will help me climb the career ladder quicker. Also, if you are doing a part-time PhD and working somewhere like the Health Protection Agency, they like you to publish papers as you are going along because it is good for the agency to be seen to be doing detailed analysis.\" </p> <p>Dougan also credits the PhD by publication method for helping to develop her writing skills. </p> <p>\"I am much more focused and able to write short papers now because you have to get quite a lot of research into a maximum of 3,000 words. Working out what is important and what to leave out is a key skill and one that I may not have developed if I had been doing a conventional thesis.\"</p> <p>Of course, producing six or seven published papers over the course of a PhD isn't easy and some types of research may not be suited to it. Dougan admits that her seven papers had a common theme running through them, so it was easier to write a commentary tying all of them together for her final submission to examiners. </p> <p>Dr Ian Lyne is head of postgraduate training and research career development at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. He says that PhDs on prospective publication are becoming more common, but are not for everyone. </p> <p>\"To get a post-doctoral position at a top lab is always going to very competitive so obviously it's good if a student can publish their work, but it isn't always possible. To get six or seven papers published can be a tall order.\" </p> <p>Instead he says PhD students should be focusing on honing other important career skills, such as networking. He advises taking a proactive approach and encourages students to think ahead about the key research groups that are working in their field. One of his top tips is to make contact informally with the group leader to express interest in its work and to find out how well junior researchers are supported within the team. Lynne also suggests asking if there are any vacancies and sending in a CV to be kept on file. However, he cautions against being too single-minded when it comes to a career in academia. </p> <p>\"Don't just drift into a job in the academic world because it is all that you know, there are lots of opportunities beyond it too,\" he says. </p> <p>Elizabeth Coulson is an example of someone who has carved out a successful career outside of research. The 29-year-old completed a PhD by thesis in high-speed lasers for datacommunications systems at Cambridge in 2005 and is now a chartered patent attorney and co-owner of patent practice, Coulson and Associates. Coulson had secured a position as a trainee patent attorney before completing her PhD and puts this down to a combination of a strong research background and well-developed softer skills, which she emphasised at interview.</p> <p>\"The firm I approached while I was completing my PhD was looking for highly qualified, technically excellent candidates and many applied,\" she explains. \"I imagine when you get so many candidates applying with similar qualifications it is very difficult to decide who gets the job. I didn't have a large publication history to draw on so I tried to be as coherent, confident and likeable at interview as I could. In a client-based industry like mine, it is important that people can build a rapport, so being able to master good interpersonal skills is crucial.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hands up all those who have Googled someone in the last week. Now, keep your hand up if you have Googled yourself in that time. Chances are there aren't many hands still in the air. According to Krishna De, a social media and personal branding expert, few people bother to find out what the internet says about them, let alone do something about it. Yet it's often the first place we turn to investigate others. Do you see the catch?</p> <p>These days, many working relationships begin electronically and some never go any further. Even when you meet someone in person, it's likely they have done their research. \"People will search for information before they meet you and afterwards as well,\" says De. \"It is like an online reference check. It's not the only thing that is important but it adds to their overall assessment of you.\"</p> <p>Graham Jones, an internet psychologist, believes online searches have taken over from traditional reference sources such as word of mouth. \"The internet plays an increasingly important role in our everyday life and recent research suggests we value it more highly than a trusted friend,\" he says. \"Now, we go to the web first and turn to our friends second.\"</p> <p>What the internet says about us is therefore becoming increasingly important to our professional reputations. The good news is that it's relatively easy to give your online image a quick makeover. The first step is to find out what the internet says about you. \"In this day and age, Googling yourself isn't about ego-surfing but about reputation management,\" says De. \"Are you happy with what you find? Is it accurate? Is it relevant?\"</p> <p>Scare stories of employers Googling potential employees only to find stories of wild nights out abound, yet it's one of the easiest things to avoid. \"Most people aren't aware of privacy settings on social networking sites,\" says De. \"It means there's no barrier to entry.\" In order to separate the professional from the personal, make use of the site's privacy options. The rule of thumb is if you wouldn't be happy for absolutely everyone to see something - whether it's your boss, clients or colleagues - then keep it hidden. </p> <p>James Reed, chairman of recruitment group Reed, says people should be careful of making photographs accessible online. \"Pictures can speak a thousand words, particularly when taken out of context,\" he warns. Just as you wouldn't take holiday snaps into a meeting, try to keep electronic versions for friends' eyes only.</p> <p>Unfortunately for technophobes, the solution isn't as simple as changing your privacy settings and retreating under the duvet. Jones believes people increasingly expect to find information about someone's professional credentials online, particularly when recruiting. \"Even though recruiters won't rely completely on what they find out about people online, if they don't find out anything about you there's an increasing attitude that you can't be much of a contributor,\" he says. Reed thinks this is overstating the case somewhat, but does believe employers can be impressed as well as unimpressed by what they find. </p> <p>It's not only recruiters that conduct online research, but also clients, colleagues, suppliers and even interviewees. \"I was speaking to the HR director of a division of one of the world's leading brands who was taken aback in an interview when the candidate said that they were surprised that they could not find the HR director on LinkedIn,\" Krishna De says. \"The situation was particularly embarrassing because the company positions itself at the leading edge of attracting and retaining employees.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, a little online savvy can go a long way. Registering on free sites that have good reputations is an easy way of creating a respectable online persona. \"LinkedIn and Ziggs are a great way to build a professional profile,\" says De. \"They're highly respected by search engines so will usually appear on the first page. They don't take much effort to maintain, unlike a blog where you have to constantly update it to keep it relevant.\"</p> <p>What's more, putting information about yourself on a trusted third-party site means it gains credibility just by association. \"It's a bit like being told by a friend that you should see a particular movie,\" says Jones. \"If you were told the same information by someone you met in a pub you would not value it as much, even though it's the same information.\"</p> <p>The crucial element in building a coherent profile is consistency. \"Before you create your entry, think about what you want to become known for,\" says De. \"You need to keep your profile consistent so people can identify and follow you through different sites.\" </p> <p>Every time your name is mentioned online, it leaves behind a \"digital footprint\", the size of which is affected not only by what you say but also what others say about you. If you want to bury irrelevant or outdated results, the best approach is usually to create lots of new entries. The undesirable results will still appear, but further down the rankings. And people are often lazy: give them what they're expecting to find and they're unlikely to look further.</p> <p>To really bolster your reputation, De recommends writing book reviews on sites such as Amazon or publishing an article on your area of expertise on ezinearticles.com. Commenting on other people's blogs can also add gravitas while being easier than starting your own. Reed recommends using blogging, discussion strands and professional journals to build a constructive professional profile, but stresses the task must be approached \"soberly rather than exuberantly\". </p> <p>Indeed, by its very nature the internet is public and it is permanent. In short, things can easily come back to haunt you. \"Be aware that whatever you write will be found by someone,\" warns De. \"If you put anything in email or online then make sure you are happy to stand by it.\"</p> <h2>How to manage your net profile</h2> <p><strong>Search for your name and see what you find. </strong><br>Although Google is the UK's most popular tool, accounting for 87% of all search engine activity, different search engines will return different results.</p> <p><strong>Check your privacy settings on social networking sites.</strong><br> It only takes a few minutes but helps you to keep your private life out of public view. Use different names to partition your internet use; for example, Joe Bloggs for personal activity and Joseph Bloggs when you're being professional.</p> <p><strong>Keep an eye out for personal information added by others.</strong> <br>If someone has tagged you in a photo that you feel is inappropriate then you can remove the tag or use a nickname. </p> <p><strong>Make use of free online tools to build a professional online identity.</strong><br>Remember that other people with your name may also be using the same sites so give yourself an easily identifiable \"brand\" with a short description of your area of expertise.</p> <p><strong>Keep abreast of where your name appears online.</strong><br>Tools such as Google alerts can update you on new entries. It's worth researching yourself regularly to know what others will find.</p>",
  "<p>There are many notable omissions from Mark Lawson's list of sporting fiction (The write track, Review, August 2).

  "<p>Godard wrote his own epitaph early, in Alphaville (1965): \"You will suffer a fate worse than death. You will become a legend.\" There is no bigger personality cult in terms of film director as artist, and Godard has always been an assiduous curator, understanding the need, as Warhol did, of making a spectacle of himself. But while professing openness he remains opaque and, in a sense, the film-maker known as Jean-Luc Godard may not exist, any more than the musician known as Bob Dylan does, except as several simulacra. For this reason, the scattered asides in Richard Brody's exhaustive new biography, Everything is Cinema, perform the book's most useful task, catching the less canny, unguarded Godard.</p> <p>He suffers from vertigo (how appropriate). He admits to having no imagination and taking everything from life. When he was given a camera to use by film-maker Don Pennebaker, Pennebaker was touched by his incompetence, which included the beginner's mistake of zooming in and out too much. He was introduced to the fleshpots of Paris in the 1950s by an early mentor, film director Jean-Pierre Melville. Financial transactions with prostitutes were treated as potential mises en sc\u00e8ne (Vivre sa vie, Sauve qui peut); cinema as whore. His handwriting features in many of his films; ditto his voice. He plays tennis, or did (he's nearly 80 now). When he passed on production money from a film to Italian revolutionaries, they used it to open a transvestite bar. He smoked a fat version of Gitanes called Boyards. In his Marxist days, he still travelled first class. He tried to avoid writing scripts whenever possible. His once great friend Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut called him \"the Ursula Andress\" of the revolutionary movement. He is Protestant in temperament and an unforgiving moralist. He drops names. He lay in a coma for a week after a motorcycle accident. He can be nasty. He has been known to suffer hopeless crushes. In late adolescence he was committed by his father into psychiatric care. His on-set tantrums are legendary. He is the Saint Simeon Stylites of cinema, atop his pillar, or, as Truffaut described him, nothing but a piece of shit on a pedestal. For all his utopian ideals, conflict and rejection are the dominant impulses of his life and work. </p> <p>In A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema, David Thomson has Godard emerge from the darkness of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que rather than any plausible biographical background. Brody restores the biography and takes the life and work in order - not necessarily the most rewarding way of approaching a subject who has declared that films require a beginning, middle and end, but not necessarily in that order.</p> <p>The facts are plain enough. Godard was born in 1930 into a rich, prestigious Swiss-French Protestant family, against whom he rebelled by turning to cinema and falling in with a like-minded crowd. In these days of image-glut, it is hard to imagine a fanatical coterie taking film so seriously. This was partly to do with catching up, after the German occupation, on previously unavailable Hollywood films; partly fashionable existentialism. Writing in Cahiers du cinema, these young filmmakers-in-waiting found moral codes in the work of men such as Howard Hawks and Hitchcock, and began to identify films by directorial signature. Steeping themselves in US cinema was also a way of sidestepping politics and the embarrassment of France's wartime collaboration (members of Godard's family had sided with Vichy France and Godard himself could be provocatively pro-German). </p> <p>Godard's criticism was a mix of hyper-enthusiasm, vicious sniping, fawning and name-dropping, with cinema regarded as a matter of life and death. It also offered an obvious direction: \"When we saw some movies we were finally delivered from the terror of writing. We were no longer crushed by the spectre of the great writers.\" He and his friends wrote their way into films via Cahiers du cinema. Photographs of the Cahiers crowd show straight young men in suits, looking like apprentice bankers, a rightwing bunch whose real target was the stuffy, inflexible French film establishment. As Godard put it: \"We barged into cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XIV.\" He watched colleagues and rivals, Claude Chabrol and Truffaut, get their features made first. He stole from his family to finance Jacques Rivette. Of the Godard family he has said approvingly that they were like foxes. The same was said, disparagingly, of him and his business practices; he liked deals with a bit of a kick to them. In a way, his artistic career can be read in terms of what he would steal or scavenge by way of reference - the magpie thief.</p> <p>Godard's first feature, \u00c0 bout de souffle (1960), was from a back-of-an-envelope sketch by Truffaut, and most of those involved, including the leads, were sure they were making a dog. Its success now looks like a combination of fluke - a long-odds bet by Godard on his own talent, which paid off - and something willed. On the one hand, he trusted his saturation in cinema to guide him. On the other, he pushed what he was doing to the limits. Not everyone was charmed by the result, but Godard was lucky with his lead, Jean-Paul Belmondo, who did charm and whose sinuous athleticism drives the film. </p> <p>Godard also ripped up the rule book, brattishly challenging the notion that cinema needed to be a polite and conformist medium in pursuit of an illusion of reality. The most pertinent critical comment was that \u00c0 bout de souffle made Truffaut's Les 400 coups (1959) look like an obedient schoolboy's homework, and Chabrol's films the product of a perfect academicism. Godard was also a brilliant publicist, with an adman's talent for reducing ideas to captions. His two great riffs were the impossibility of love, and death. He charged on, working cheap, careering between success and failure. Les Carabiniers (1963) was a spectacular flop. When his future collaborator Jean-Pierre Gorin went to see it, the cinema refused to show it unless someone else turned up. Godard was restless, not given to repetition: he reworked the gangster film, musicals, science fiction, changing styles as he went along. The notorious jump cuts that were his signature in \u00c0 bout de souffle were little used again. </p> <p>But false premise (and promise) became a recurring motif in a career sustained less by its triumphs than by cul-de-sacs, professional crises and personal breakdowns, many self-inflicted as a way of inducing an artistic response. \"Breathless\" applies to his initial, prolific output of 15 features in seven years, until he ran out of steam and threw himself into Maoist dogma with the same blind vigour and instinct for the zeitgeist. It seemed a remarkable volte-face for a man whose early political views had been described as virtually fascist, but he was really only swapping one authoritarian form for another. He acquired a student wife (his second, Anne Wiazemsky, whose attraction was having played the lead in Robert Bresson's Au hasard Balthazar of 1966) and a collaborator, Gorin, whose radical influence helped him realise greater autonomy on his return to production proper, with the repentant Sauve qui peut (1980). The revolutionary phase now seems less Maoist than Lennonist; Gorin declared at the time, \"I am the Yoko Ono of cinema.\" Then as now, politics seemed to be one part of a more complex personal agenda. Even an ostensibly political film from the first period such as Le Petit soldat (1963), about an extreme-right death squad in the Algerian conflict, views more like a Swiss holiday (shot in Geneva to avoid French censorship) and love letter to Anna Karina, who would become his first wife, in their first film together.</p> <p>The surprise in Brody's account is the thoroughness with which Godard strip-mined his life to feed the films. The opening marital row in Vivre sa vie (1962), prompted by a confession of infidelity by a wife (Karina), sounds so raw it could have been a rehash of the previous night's argument, provoked by Godard for the sake of the scene. In a cinematic version of Stockholm syndrome, Karina remained a prisoner in his films long after their marriage was over. Their psychosexual dynamic probably finds its most accurate summary not in something written about them at all, but in Terence Blacker's biography of Willie Donaldson, You Cannot Live As I Have Lived and Not End Up Like This: \"She sensed that what really excited him was sexual jealousy and . . . was prepared to go as far as he wanted, taunting him, betraying him with other men and then returning to face his ecstatic rage.\"</p> <p>The real reason for Godard's bust-up with Truffaut was because Truffaut was more successful at seducing actresses. But in Truffaut's films an actress, had by him or not, remains an actress, where in Godard's hands Karina became transcendent, thereby making herself redundant (her career barely survived Godard). Few have appeared more exposed by the camera, flayed even. In Vivre sa vie she was cast as a prostitute while Godard, salacious and prudish, Nosferatu and pimp, remained reluctant to share her and expected her at all times to be well-mannered and demure.</p> <p>Just as Godard has played with cinema, he has constructed multiple versions of himself before and behind the camera, leasing out the character of JLG to actors and sometimes acting himself: cinephile, tyrant, tardy, silver-tongued, Professor Pluggy, politico, foxy businessman, smutty Uncle Jean, fraud (a history of youthful theft), romantic, classicist, dandy, hypochondriac and slacker. A cold reading of the man suggests hysteric, obsessive, depressive, leavened by the schoolboy who was remembered for playing the fool. An early collaborator told me they fell out because \"He's a liar and, what's more, he knows I know he is a liar!\" \"Je suis un con,\" Belmondo says at the beginning of \u00c0 bout de souffle, a clear enough mission statement for the general cinematic conduct to follow and the recurring, underlying question of how much of a shit is it necessary to be in life and film.</p> <p>Godard eventually swapped a private life with actresses for one with a director, Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville, under whose stern eye he appeared in two features as a man racked by jealousy, bookish, remote, endlessly bickering and so berated by his partner (played by her) that, in another variation of the Stockholm syndrome, with the boot on the other foot now, he is the one who breaks down, sobbing; jailer turned captive.</p> <p>\"Film is a battleground,\" said US director Sam Fuller in his cameo in Pierrot le fou (1965), which was shot by Godard's regular cameraman Raoul Coutard - tough, fast and a veteran of the battle of Dien Bien Phu. Whether by fluke, design or incompetence, Godard the genius and Coutard the hero set their own rhythm from the start, Godard writing on location with cast and crew waiting. Using little or no additional lighting, they learned to push stock exposures to the limit (there were thousands of feet of night shooting on Alphaville). Conditions permitting, they dumped lighting, tracks, sync sound, hair and makeup and, above all, continuity, shooting as much as possible on the hoof - and if anyone looked at the camera, so what.</p> <p>Characteristic of the method, usually to do with running over budget, was a loose series of scenes followed by an incredibly long one, shot fast in a single space in extended takes, in an effort to recoup costs, during which a man and woman fail to resolve their relationship. What Godard had grasped was that film didn't have to pretend to be real.</p> <p>He admitted his laziness shooting \u00c0 bout de souffle, the clever slacker who gets by on reading the first and last page of a book. Elia Kazan, visiting the set of Vivre sa vie, was uncomprehending when told that Godard never shot a scene from more than one angle. Melville, a more classic and scrupulous director than Godard, criticised his sloppiness, as a result of which their friendship ended.</p> <p>Coutard told a fellow crew member on Alphaville that what Godard would really like would be \"to swallow the film whole and process it out his ass - that way he wouldn't need anybody\". Given that his creative process is to manipulate everything, himself included, it is tempting to brand Godard as a sophisticated high-class soap, a product based on a tailored understanding of market and media. As his audience diminishes, his reputation is enhanced through careful cultivation of, and endorsement by, art establishments and academia. Once ahead of his time, embracing new technology (video) and surfing the zeitgeist as someone might browse the internet, he now denounces digital as death and takes refuge in history, in anticipation of posterity's judgment. </p> <p>Talking about Luchino Visconti's Senso (1954), Godard said: \"Each time, I want to know what Farley Granger says to Alida Valli, bang! - fade out.\" The same is true of Brody, and often one wants more than what's offered - on the French intellectual climate in general (he remains much more comfortable with American responses to Godard) and, given Godard's animosity, on established feuds. Brody also fails to mention his own snubbing when in Switzerland in 2000 to profile Godard for the New Yorker. In a typical Godardian move, the director terminated the interview by note, blaming Brody for being vague and unfocused, which was the last thing he probably was. Also typical, Godard and Mi\u00e9ville, a scary pair at best, made a point of dining at Brody's hotel that evening and blanking him.</p> <p>Godard remains stubbornly silent about the darkness surrounding many relationships. He describes his childhood as idyllic, which is disingenuous when the career is so full of acts of surrogate patricide, and what would a shrink make of one of the first lines of \u00c0 bout de souffle, when Godard's surrogate sings \"Pa-Pa-Patricia!\"? The disturbed adolescence, the stealing, suicidal tendencies, the committal for psychiatric inspection, a period that lasted some months - none is adequately explained. Nor is the effect of his parents' break-up around the same time and his mother's death two years later in a road accident. Nor are his unexplained absences, Karina's and his unborn child, her suicide attempts, let alone his return from the dead, or how they all fed into the films. </p> <p>Godard has remained prolific, if less seen. There are more than 100 credits altogether, but since the mid-1980s the films have been harder to see, as audience and critical interest dwindled and distribution became erratic. Brody considers Sauve qui peut Godard's second great \"first\" film, but if memory serves, an earlier return with Num\u00e9ro Deux (1975) was bolder in its use of film and video, and its analysis of family life, grubby ordinariness, sexual economics and the relentlessness of male desire. </p> <p>With age, Godard came to regard cinema, which he had once taken for his secular bible, in increasingly biblical terms, its fall marked by the rupture of the second world war and cinema's failure to record the Holocaust as it happened. He turned on Hollywood, particularly Steven Spielberg. His later work is self-consciously that of a crabby iconoclast and old master. In \u00c9loge de l'amour (2001), the black and white stock is treated with a painterly reverence worthy of Rembrandt, the pellicule or grain of the film as important to the character of the piece as the story (which is deliberately fractured) or movement of the actors. Despite Brody's exhaustive shot synopsis, the film remains elusive because Godard resists conventional summary: it is a question of textures and associations, animated by his knowledge that a form of cinema understood by him (35mm black and white) has become redundant. Focus in Godard has always been on what remains unsaid and spatial distance, particularly that between the audience and the screen. I often switch off to what the films are about, entranced instead by the abstract interplay of elements and the astonishing achievement of taking an industrial process and fooling around with it like it were miniDV. </p> <p>Cinema comes down to something shown. Godard said as much in 1965: \"The important thing is to be aware that one exists. For three-quarters of the time during the day one forgets this truth, which surges up again as you look at houses or a red light, and you have the sensation of existing in that moment.\" He repeated the point years later with reference to Hitchcock: \"We forget why Janet Leigh stops at the Bates motel . . . what Henry Fonda was not entirely guilty of and exactly why the American government hired Ingrid Bergman. But we remember a glass of milk, the blades of a windmill, a hairbrush.\"</p> <p>Subscribing to Godard, it is hard not to develop a personal and argumentative relationship, and watching any Godard is a more subjective experience than viewing, say, Carol Reed's The Third Man. Because the films rarely offer more than perfunctory closure, cartoonish even in death, they remain open, functioning more like books. Godard spans cinema, being of a generation that grew up with and followed its arc, and in his Swiss-Protestant way he was its Reformation. Brody's linear approach pays off in showing how Godard has in effect been making one big film, a life's work and a reference map of cinema. But one unanswered question remains: we know he was great, but was he any good?</p>",
  "<p>Appropriately enough, Steve Carell's grandfather was instrumental in the development of the cathode ray tube, until recently a standard fixture of the average American TV set. The same might be said of his grandson. After starting out in The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, Carell clocked up over 300 appearances on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where his average-Joe looks provided a deceptive frame for his spontaneous satire. Those looks caught on quickly: he wasn't a risqu\u00e9 goof like Mike Myers, a rubber-faced devil like Jim Carrey or a buffoon like Will Ferrell. And when he landed the role as the endearingly hangdog Michael Scott, Scranton's David Brent in the US remake of The Office, he really began to dominate the TV landscape winning Emmys, Golden Globes and MTV awards. </p> <p>In the movies, however, things haven't been so smooth. He made an impact in Bruce Almighty (2003) and Anchorman (2004) but it was his breakout hit, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, in which he excelled as the title character, infusing a 2D nerd with a soulful integrity. He was officially a new comedy sensation, but the film that followed - the Bruce sequel Evan Almighty - bombed at the box office, and if it wasn't for his subtle work as a gay philosophy teacher in the sleeper hit Little Miss Sunshine, it may have finished him.</p> <p>Still, Hollywood is willing to take a chance on Steve Carell. Which is how he's ended up in a big-budget remake of Get Smart, the kitsch Mel Brooks-produced 60s TV series about a secret US government agency called CONTROL that was permanently in combat with an eastern European outfit called KAOS. Following in the late Don Adams' po-faced performance as agent Maxwell Smart, Carell is just perfect, a terrific, deadpan clown who proves his suitability for the role by meeting us at the film's downtown LA set in a grey suit, with a warm smile, a handshake and great big burnt hole where the back of his trousers used to be. </p> <p>\"Without giving too much away,\" he says apologetically, \"there are certain action sequences in this movie that take away most of the seat of my pants, because they're so violent. And all that's left is my shiny behind.\" He pauses, thinking about the famous agony he endured in The 40 Year-Old Virgin. \"I didn't have to have it waxed, though.\" </p> <p>In an hour or so, Carell will be back out on the street for the film's climactic chase. The president of the United States is attending a concert where KAOS terrorists have planted a bomb, and Maxwell has to stop them. Aiding him on this mission are his Little Miss Sunshine co-star Alan Arkin, as the boss of CONTROL, and the beautiful Anne Hathaway as his sidekick, Agent 99. You'd expect this sort of capering around from Will Ferrell, but it seems a bit energetic for the bookish Carell. Indeed, it's telling that his so-called \"action\" figure from 40 Year-Old Virgin did nothing at all, except bark \"KELLY CLARKSON!\" or \"HER BREASTS FELT LIKE BAGS OF SAND\" when you pressed a button. So how weird is it for him, coming from a comedy background? </p> <p>\"It's an adventure, I guess,\" he shrugs. \"Because not in a million years would I ever have imagined hanging off the side of the car, or jumping off a moving airplane.\"</p> <p>Weirdly for a funny guy, Carell is a calming presence in the room. He has a low-key, playful wit about him that makes him a rarity: a comedian you might actually want to spend some time with. He's quick, sharp and intelligent, but above all he simply seems nice. Which is lovely. However, one question hanging over Get Smart is whether or not it's relevant in a world where terrorism is once more a brutal reality. Haven't times changed? \"I think times have changed, yes,\" he nods, \"and yet they have stayed more the same than some people realise - look at North Korea. There is a lot of anxiety in the world today, in terms of terrorism and in terms of other countries' nuclear capabilities. It's very relevant still. I think it subsided for a while and, internationally, people started to have a false sense of security, but now there's a very real threat, to everybody. So while it isn't a specific cold war mentality, there is a sense of danger in the world right now, which I think this story plays into. But it's not something we ever mock or make fun of. I don't think the script ever pokes fun at the global situation; it just uses it to propel the story.\"</p> <p>The story itself, which Carell had a hand in shaping, is more Casino Royale than Austin Powers, with Smart becoming an agent and having to prove himself to his peers: the snotty 99 and the rather more supportive 23 (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson). But, quite frankly, when the director is Peter Segal, the man behind Naked Gun 33 1/3, it's not going to be Shakespeare. \"It's more of an origins story,\" says Carell, \"about how Maxwell came to become an agent. So we find out a bit more about what led him to become a spy in the first place. He's someone who's by-the-book, straitlaced and incredibly driven. And proficient. He is smart, and he does have abilities, but they're sometimes counter-intuitive. He's not a bumbling Clouseau sort of character because I feel - personally - that that's well-trodden territory.\"</p> <p>It's an interesting distinction, because, significantly, Carell's role models aren't larger-than-life funnymen; they're character actors like Arkin or - more pertinently - Clouseau himself, Peter Sellers: \"Performers,\" he explains, \"who never indicate anything about themselves as actors. They don't comment on how funny they think anything is, they just play convincing characters. They're completely believable, regardless of how broadly they play those characters. You just buy the fact that those people exist in the world.\"</p> <p>And hopefully, given Get Smart's successful $38m opening weekend in the US, Carell will get a few more chances to pursue that style of comedy. As for the future of The Office, though, he remains blank. Will he walk away, as Gervais did? And will the public let him? \"I have no idea,\" he says, \"I try not to predetermine. Ricky actually planned to do as many episodes as he did, then walked away, so that was a disciplined decision on his part. He did as many as he felt were viable and cared to do. I think that shows a lot of confidence and integrity. I respect him very much.\"</p> <p>For now, Carell is simply taking it all in his stride, just as he takes sprinting down the street with his arse hanging out, and grappling The Rock for a living. \"It's all surreal,\" he muses. \"Just the last couple of years has been surreal. The fact that I'm even employed is surreal!\"</p> <p>And with that, Carell returns to the set, showing a quick flash of his boxer-shorted buttocks.</p> <p>\"I have to go and show people my butt more,\" he grins. \"It's no thrill, believe me.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Get Smart is out on August 22</p> <h2>All about Steve</h2> <p><strong>The Daily Show</strong></p> <p> Carell would do anything for Jon Stewart. He once drank enough alcohol to make him vomit, after calling Antonio Banderas \"a sexy, sexy man\". </p> <p><strong>Anchorman</strong></p> <p>Retarded weatherman Brick Tamland was Carell's finest hour, eating candles, loving lamp and offering free passes to the \"pants party\". </p> <p><strong>Bruce Almighty </strong></p> <p>Jim Carrey was the star but Carell stole the show as his tongue-tied TV news rival, performing facial acrobatics with sound effects to match. </p> <p><strong>The 40 Year-Old Virgin </strong></p> <p>A clearly painful real-life chest-waxing took Carell the extra distance in this comic tale of a middle-aged nerd's late sexual awakening. </p> <p><strong>The Office (US) </strong></p> <p>Carell ferried Ricky Gervais's hit sitcom across the Atlantic, turning Slough's David Brent into Michael Scott of Scranton, PA. </p> <p><strong>Little Miss Sunshine </strong></p> <p>Proving his versatility, Carell charmed the arthouse set with this Sundance breakout indie, playing a bearded, gay, suicidal philosophy scholar. </p> <p><strong>Evan Almighty </strong></p> <p>The flop sequel to Bruce Almighty, this kid-skewed comedy found Carell's compromised Congressman become a latter-day Noah. </p> <p><strong>Get Smart </strong></p> <p>The cold war TV skit finally gets a big-screen makeover, with Carell following 60s icon Don Adams as bungling secret agent Maxwell Smart.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Supreme silence</strong></p> <p>The Supreme Temple is the centrepiece of the Workers' Cultural Palace - a Mao era name that assures anonymity - but the temple grounds are gorgeously tranquil, ignored by everyone making a beeline to the overwhelmed adjacent Imperial Palace.

Roam the hushed grounds of the surrounding park bordering the palace moat; there's even a tennis court within earshot of the Forbidden City.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Supreme Temple, directly north east of Tiananmen Gate.</p> <p><strong>Martial arts in Ritan Park</strong></p> <p>A good place to take a breather from sightseeing is Ritan Park, Beijing's former Altar to the Sun, one of many altars where imperial sacrifices were performed to appease nature. Immerse yourself in energetic training with English-speaking taiji quan (tai chi) and bagua zhang (\"eight trigram palm\") instructors. Following the poses of these ancient martial arts in such a tranquil setting can inspire an affinity for Beijing that weeks of sightseeing cannot.

Jump on a hired bicycle and keep one step ahead of the wrecking ball, weaving through Beijing's magical warren of crumbling lanes. With children laughing, men slurping beer and playing chess outside Qing dynasty courtyard gates, the Beijing of old is yours for the taking. Pack a map perhaps, but ditch the compass - lanes run east-west or north-south. It's easy to do yourself: hutong alleys riddle the whole of Beijing within the second ring road, but the best areas are in the Dongcheng district - especially south-east of the Drum Tower and north-east of the Forbidden City or around the Shichahai lakes north of Beihai Park.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bike hire: from your hotel or hostel, or the rental operator just west of the Novotel Peace Hotel on Jinyu Hutong, off Wangfujing Dajie. </p> <p><strong>A breather at the Drum &amp; Bell</strong></p> <p>After staggering up and down the steep steps of the Drum Tower and the Bell Tower - Beijing's surviving historic towers about a mile due north of the Forbidden City - take a breather on the simple roof terrace of the unpretentious Drum &amp; Bell Bar, which attracts a mixed Chinese and foreign crowd. Sandwiched between its namesake monuments, you can forget Beijing's high-rises and modern architecture: the surrounding traditional hutong rooftops are what Beijing's really all about. If it gets hot up top, sink into one of their marshmallow-soft sofas in the casual downstairs bar. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 41 Zhonglouwan Hutong (+10-8403 3600). </p> <p><strong>Maoist slogan tour</strong></p> <p>A minority sport perhaps, but spotting Cultural Revolution slogans can tie in neatly with sightseeing. The 798 Art District is carpeted in red Maoist maxims, although some have been touched up - ask gallery owners to decipher them. Faint slogans still survive beneath the windows of 34 Dongjiaomin Xiang - a road east off Tiananmen Square renamed Anti-Imperialism Road during the Cultural Revolution - in the former Foreign Legation Quarter where the foreign powers had their embassies in the early 19th century. Explore the charming alley of Nanluogu Xiang in Dongcheng district with its bars, cafes and hutong hotels - and track down the slogan opposite the Plastered T-shirts shop at number 61, which proclaims: \"For industry study Daqing, for agriculture study Dazhai, for the whole nation study the People's Liberation Army\". </p> <p><strong>Take a pew</strong></p> <p>You may think that China's spirituality is pitched somewhere between Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Communism, but Christianity is growing fast. The high profile East Cathedral (St Joseph's Church) is a mainstay of touristy Wangfujing Dajie, but St Michael's Church, the South Cathedral and the North Cathedral are just as interesting. Not only is their architecture graceful, Beijing's churches are also refreshingly cool retreats from the fierce summer sun. If you can't get in, knock on the gates and someone should come and open them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> St Joseph's Cathedral, 74 Wangfujing Dajie. St Michael's Church, 11 Dongjiaomin Xiang. North Cathedral, Xishiku Dajie. South Cathedral, 141 Qianmen Xidajie. </p> <p><strong>Toy town</strong></p> <p>Embedded delightfully within a famous hutong area a short hop west of the Confucius Temple, Bannerman Tang's Toys and Crafts specialises in colourful displays of handmade collectibles and folk craft pieces. The traditional Chinese version of Weebles (bu dao weng - literally \"old man who won't fall over\") go elbow to elbow with clay figures, and kites jostle for space with colourful feline-shaped tiger pillows. Items are made according to traditional methods.

The decor (plastic grapes, cavernous interior) won't win any style awards, but you're here for Xinjiang lamb kebabs, nang (filling naan-like discs of bread), pulled noodles or - if you can get a gang together - a whole roast lamb. Alcohol is on the menu, so now's your chance to try erguotou, Beijing's mind-bending and highly flammable spirit or its up-market cousin from Guizhou province, Maotai. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 6 Niujie Beikou (+10-8316 4691); approx Y40pp.</p> <p><strong>Evening drinks at The Tree</strong></p> <p>When its last home was flattened by city planners, The Tree uprooted and replanted itself in this sheltered corner of Sanlitun - one of Beijing's most famous bar districts. With over 40 Belgian brews from Chimay to Delirium Tremens, The Tree has one of the best selections of beer in town, essential when local brews (Beijing, Yanjing and Tsingtao) start to taste samey. Vibrant at weekends, The Tree is inviting at any time and the wood-fired pizzas enjoy citywide fame.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 43 Bei Sanlintun Nan (+10-6415 1954, <a href=\"http://www.treebeijing.com\">treebeijing.com</a>). </p> <p><strong>China Culture Center</strong></p> <p>Whether it's walking the Beijing back streets, watching a cricket-fighting contest (an insect version of cockfighting), hiking around rural Beijing or fathoming the mysteries of the I Ching, the China Culture Center (CCC) offers quirky tours around the capital and beyond, with parallel lectures on Chinese culture.

Around 45km east of Badaling, Jiankou is a far more authentic Great Wall experience. Hefty tracts of overgrown masonry snake along mountainous ridges and plunge down hillsides in a stupendous, jaw-dropping landscape. It's a 40-minute walk from the village of Jiankou to the barely visited but far superior rear section the wall, but watch your step - even though you can walk a considerable way along the wall itself, some sections have collapsed. You can visit alone, but it's safer with companions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Take fast bus 916 (60-90mins) from Dongzhimen long-distance bus station to Huairou; then hire a minivan (one hour; Y200 return) to the rear Jiankou section. Admission Y20.</p> <p><strong>Ming murals</strong></p> <p>The careless restoration work and slapdash rebuilding of so many old monuments means that finding genuine pre-Qing dynasty history is a tall order in China. The Ming dynasty Buddhist murals at Fahai Si - Sea of the Law Temple - are in their original hues, but you'll need to pack a small torch: the frescoes are swathed in gloom to protect their 500-year-old pigments. Nearby is the tranquil Tomb of Tian Yi, a famous 16th-century eunuch. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fahai Temple (admission Y20; open 8am-4pm). Take subway line 1 to Pingguoyuan station, then a taxi (Y10).</p> <p><strong>Temple town</strong></p> <p>Its skyline pierced by Buddhist pagodas, the alluring walled town of Zhengding outside the Hebei provincial capital Shijiazhuang presents a crumbling snapshot of dynastic China. An easy day exploring the temples is enough to get a feel for Zhengding's historic layout. The city walls badly need maintenance but it's worth the trip to see Dafo Si (Big Buddha Temple), housing a huge, 10th-century bronze statue of Guanyin (the Goddess of Mercy). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Express trains from Beijing West train station take 2\u00bdhrs to Shijiazhuang, then bus 201 on Daocha Jie (Daocha St) just south of the train station for the short journey to Zhengding. Admission Y60.</p> <p><strong>Fortress town</strong></p> <p>You can visit the small walled town of Shanhaiguan on a day trip, but spending the night here allows more time for the town's historic hutong charms to fully work their magic. A section of the Ming dynasty's old town may have had a pre-Olympic facelift, but the original wall is intact and a magnificent maze of hutong alleys survives. A few kilometres north of town, the Great Wall meets the sea at Laolongtou and across the border in Liaoning province are further remnants of the bastion at Jiumenkou.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The 9.20am D5 train to Shenyang from Beijing train station arrives in Shanhaiguan at 11.27am. </p> <p><strong>Pastoral Peking</strong></p> <p>Festooned with Maoist slogans and surrounded by hills, the ancient stone hamlet of Chuandixia is a bucolic refuge from Beijing. Wander the narrow lanes, peek into old stone courtyard houses and immerse yourself in a panorama of ancient China. Consider overnighting in one of the ancient homesteads, where you can just turn up and get a bed from around Y15 and rise with the cock crow rather than the jackhammer. If you get a taxi, ask your driver to return via Lingshui, a nearby village dating from the Tang dynasty.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Take Line 1 of the metro to the Pingguoyuan stop, then a taxi (Y140 round trip); or the 7.30am or 12.30pm bus direct to Chuandixia from Pingguoyuan. Admission: Y20.</p> <p><strong>Great Wall trek</strong></p> <p>The heart-pumping four-hour, 10km Jinshanling to Simatai trek - around 70km north east of Jiankou - is an excellent way to explore a long, dramatic section of the Great Wall. Pack sunscreen and as much water as you can carry. Limpet-like hawkers proffer refreshments when you run dry, with prices rising the more parched you appear, so try to look indifferent. On the hike along the wall you'll pass staggering mountainous scenery and sequences of collapsed watchtowers, many plundered for their bricks by farmers. Most hotels and youth hostels book tours for the hike, leaving at around 6am, returning to Beijing by around 7pm. It's a long bus journey to the wall itself with meals and guides generally thrown in.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tours cost around Y180. Tickets: Jinshanling admission Y40; Simatai admission Y40; rope bridge crossing Y5.</p> <p><strong>Jimingyi</strong></p> <p>This tiny historic town is China's oldest surviving post station and the antithesis to modern-day Beijing. Ringed by a collapsing wall, the once well-to-do town has totally missed out on China's economic boom. Some of its temples survive, even if many of its courtyard houses have vanished, but behind the decay and neglect lurk vestiges of Qing dynasty grandeur in its mighty town gates and occasional spirit walls (which faced the residences of prosperous families). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The bus to Shacheng takes 2hrs from Beijing's Liuliqiao long-distance bus station; ask for the Jimingyi drop off, then walk 2km to Jimingyi across the overpass. </p> <p><strong>Yunmeng mountain</strong></p> <p>The stunning forested mountains of Yunmengshan north of Beijing deliver cool temperatures and fresh air. The clamber from the foot of Yunmengshan to its highest point takes four to five hours and there's a camp site where you can overnight - take everything you might need, from food and water to a flashlight and insect repellent. There are also comfortable hotels in the area.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bus 936 from Dongzhimen long-distance bus station to Yunmengshan. </p> <p><strong>Death valley</strong></p> <p>Their remoteness makes the Western Qing Tombs a much more serene experience than the over-visited Ming Tombs north of Beijing. In all, there are four emperors' tombs; the principle mausoleum is Tailing, resting place of the emperor Yongzheng, but it's the Confucian Imperial tomb design and distant mountain panoramas that create such a unique impression. The rest of the Qing emperors were buried at the Eastern Qing Tombs, on the other side of Beijing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The best way to reach the Western Qing Tombs is to hire a car with a driver; ask your hotel or Top-A (+10 6438 1634) can arrange. </p> <p><strong>Sacred escape </strong></p> <p>In the far-flung suburban Western Hills, the revered area of Badachu is not just famous for its constellation of Buddhist temples, it's also an excellent spot for hiking in Beijing's nearest range of mountains. The name Badachu (Eight Great Sites) commemorates the eight Buddhist shrines and pagodas that crown its various peaks, including the splendid Buddha's Tooth Pagoda at Lingguang Si (Temple of Spiritual Light).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bus 972 from Pingguoyuan metro station on Line 1; get off at the Badachu stop.</p>",
  "<p>Looking down at our plates the other night, I heard the dread words. The ones I knew were coming one day. The sound of the apocalypse.</p> <p>\"Is it OK to eat fish?\" Sophie looked up from her haddock. \"I mean, ethically?\"</p> <p>Now I'm a carnivore forced into vegetarian clothing while at home, and the compromise is that we eat fish. But killing any creature is a big compromise for a life-long veggie like Sophie, and I don't like anything that threatens our peace treaty. I don't like hearing that fish just wanna have fun, or that every fish has a mummy. At the same time, I've read my share of eco-armageddon stuff on the marine environment. Like Taras Grescoe's new book, Bottomfeeders, a stunning expose of human folly with fishing around the globe. I know all that, but I can't help myself: giving up on fish would be totally gutting, and perhaps unnecessary.</p> <p>So I answered firmly, \"Yes.\" The sort of voice, I hoped, that delivered certainty, and brooked no argument.</p> <p>A week later, an old friend, Chris Bax, got in touch: \"Would I be interested in doing a weekend course in coastal food foraging? There's a few other people coming. We'll hunt in rock pools, go out in a boat, make sushi . . .\" I saw my opportunity. No longer a slave to trawl nets and industrial ocean hoovers, I would salvage dignity for myself and the fish. The nobility of the hunt would be mine, plus some Yorkshire sushi.</p> <p>Chris met me and the other participants at midday on the quayside at Whitby where we jumped aboard John Whitton's boat, Never Can Tella.</p> <p>This is a tough bit of coast for boats: in the late 19th century there was one year that had at least one wreck a day for all 365 days. No wonder Bram Stoker chose such a red-blooded spot to have Dracula shipwrecked. Storms can close the harbour mouth for long periods in winter, but we were lucky with the weather, chugging out past the rows of fish and chip shops, in sunshine. </p> <p>John and his mate Tony showed me the morning's catch: several lobsters, velvet crabs, edible crabs and a huge octopus whose feeding habits seemed straight out of Bram Stoker too. \"They drape themselves over the pot, stick their tentacles inside and crush the lobster, then pick out the bits.\"</p> <p>\"Will you eat him?\"</p> <p>John shook his head. Apparently no one eats or buys octopus. I don't blame them: my own experience is of rubbery snacks around the Med. Chris, however, took it and dropped it into our goodie box along with a couple of lobsters and a selection of crabs. Up front in the tiny cabin, John introduced me to the technology that is devastating our sealife. Simple and cheap pieces of software that coordinate the boat's position and show fish shoals. These are the tools of modern fishing, and the result is frequently total madness: vast quantities of fish discarded because they are the wrong species - 87,000 tonnes of haddock alone every year for the past 40 years in the North Sea, huge vessels scooping up edible sardines or Antarctic krill to feed to farmed salmon (along with chicken feathers and feet, artificial colourants and antibiotics), and the remorseless hunt for bluefin tuna that is sending populations the way of all cod. John's boat may be a tiny day-sailer, but it still has the same devastating technology. A tap of a key and we had a 3-D representation of the sea bed showing a first world war wreck poking up.</p> <p>\"With this, we can drop our lines down the side of it and drift away with the tide.\"</p> <p>The difference between us and a super-trawler was in our catching gear. Where they have a lethal array of nets and electrified stunning equipment, we were holding 5ft long rods, wooden Scarborough reels and rigs of feathered lures. It could not be simpler. John gave me the lowdown on the complex angling technique known as jigging. \"You drop the line to the bottom, then jig the lure up and down.\"</p> <p>But I didn't get to the bottom. The lure went over the side and descended halfway, about 60ft, then it stopped and started doing its own jigging.</p> <p>\"Mackerel,\" said John, \"Reel 'em in.\"</p> <p>Leaning over the gunwale, I could see them coming up: sudden surges of quicksilver, flashing down there in the green depths. One fell off but two landed on the deck, smacking at the boards with their tails, their backs so beautifully marked that I squatted there for a long while gazing at them in awe. I hadn't caught a mackerel since I was 14 and long forgotten the sheer magic of that feeling.</p> <p>The others were hooking into the shoal too, and soon our tub was filling up. \"I'm going to shift the boat,\" said John, \"Otherwise we'll never get through to the cod and whiting lower down. Reel in.\"</p> <p>Back in the cabin, I asked about cod: were the press stories of collapsed population true?</p> <p>\"Yes,\" he said emphatically. \"Things are getting worse for cod. The only population doing well is lobster.\"</p> <p>This might seem like a tiny piece of good news, but as Taras Grescoe points out in his book, lobsters are doing fine since fish populations collapsed. Seaweed beds have grown and the lobster thrives in them with few predators to bother it. Whitby is doing well from shellfish, if not the traditional cod. The truth is that the world's oceans are filling up with crustaceans and slime.</p> <p>As if to reinforce the bad news, we were suddenly into a patch of cod and whiting, most of them too small to eat. John had us put them all back. Nevertheless, after three hours we had a tub containing two cod, half a dozen whiting and about a hundred mackerel. Chris looked relieved. \"I have been out and caught nothing,\" he admitted. \"But this is good - we can do some sushi.\"</p> <p>By dinnertime we were over at the camp, a few miles up the coast, raising a good fire. Chris, a trained chef as well as bushcraft expert, taught me how to fillet and trim for sushi, then prepare crab. John, one of the other participants, was tenderising octopus with a stick. Richard, a forester from Lancashire, was learning how to deal with lobster while Rose, a sculptor, chose to go and collect a salad of wild leaves. I will remember many tastes from that night: the delicate flavours of raw mackerel, and the buttery beauty of a fresh lobster, but most surprising was the octopus - a creature thrown in the UK's fishery bin. Not a hint of car tyre, just sweet and tender.</p> <p>Next day we were not so fortunate with the weather, but the food possibilities never stopped. A walk down to the sea through Oakrigg woods was punctuated by stops for plants: herb bennet - very like cloves; woundwort - very good antiseptic; a clutch of different mushrooms, all edible.</p> <p>The beach was at Port Mulgrave, a tiny former mining cove up the coast from Whitby, now little visited, but full of interesting flora and fauna. Despite frequent rain squalls we pressed on, collecting seaweeds and whelks, even a lobster that had strayed from deeper waters. Chris passed me a piece of kelp to nibble on and washed the sand from a load of laver, a seaweed that is used in the nori of Japanese sushi. \"In Wales they use it in laver bread - oats, seaweed and bacon fat - we'll try it for breakfast. There are no inedible seaweeds in Britain so you just check the water quality, then try them!\"</p> <p>There is a kind of enthusiasm that only real foodies can generate, and that of the wild food foodie is particularly infectious. Chris has that type of creative imagination that can run to extravagances like woodlouse pizza, or innovations such as a fish smoker made from a Quality Street tin and some oak shavings. That night we drank Chris's home-made elderflower champagne and sipped his hawthorn blossom liqueur before our feast. The final morning was all seaweed recipes and things to do with whelks.</p> <p>I came away with all sorts of new skills and knowledge, some confidence about gathering and handling coastal food, plus several mackerel that the local farmer had kept in his fridge for me. We even learned how to call roe deer, bringing a large buck bouncing out the woods. Then we realised he wasn't fish and sent him back. I'm not sure I went home with an answer to Sophie's question. But the catching of it, by hand and personally, was positively saintly in comparison with the industrial sea hoovers of this world. My next task is to dig up some horseradish, then the dream of Yorkshire sushi will become reality.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chris Bax (07914 290083, <a href=\"http://www.tastethewild.co.uk\">tastethewild.co.uk</a>) runs courses in wild food, including coastal foods.

  "<p>It has always been hard to work out who fired the first shot in any of the many conflicts that have broken out in the Caucasus. Ever since June 1992, when the tiny mountain enclave of South Ossetia won the first round of its bid to detach itself from Georgia, the two sides have been intermittently at war. But the flare-ups in the last decade have been skirmishes, and for a while it looked as if peace had broken out. </p> <p>The weapons used yesterday - tanks, multiple rocket launchers and fighter aircraft - made the fighting qualitatively different. Observers had little doubt the operation to take South Ossetia back under Georgian control bore the hallmarks of a planned military offensive. </p> <p>It was not the result of a ceasefire that had broken down the night before. It was more a fulfillment of the promise the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, made to recapture lost national territory, and with it a measure of nationalist pride.</p> <p>The assault appears to have been carefully timed to coincide with the opening of the Olympic games when the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was in Beijing. Tom de Waal of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting and an expert on the region said: \"Clearly there have been incidents on both sides, but this is obviously a planned Georgian operation, a contingency plan they have had for some time, to retake [South Ossetia's capital] Tskhinvali. </p> <p>\"Possibly the Georgians calculated that with Putin in Beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months, because the Russians won't take this lying down.\"</p> <p>If Georgia calculated that Russia would be inhibited by Putin's absence, it soon backfired. Within hours, the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, chaired a session of the security council in the Kremlin, ordering units of 58th Russian army to retake Tskhinvali. His military credentials are so weak, he had no other choice.</p> <p>The Russians are far from blameless. They have a long and dirty history of dividing and ruling, fomenting strife to weaken opponents in a critical frontier zone. But Russia could claim in the UN security council to be defending its own citizens and its own peacekeepers. Sabine Freizer, Europe programme director of the International Crisis Group said: \"Russia should not be blamed for the fighting, but Russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate, and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into South Ossetia.\" Events may have already overtaken this. A proxy war risks becoming an open conflict between Russia and Georgian troops, not just in the tiny enclave of South Ossetia, but in another breakaway statelet of Abkhazia.</p> <p>Gen Mamuka Kurashvili, a Georgian military officer in charge of operations, said on Rustavi 2 television that Georgian forces were moving \"to establish constitutional order in the region\", an ominous phrase used in the past by the Russians to justify its two wars to crush the separatist movement in Chechnya.</p> <p>But it was this situation that Russia warned of, when America, Britain and most EU governments recognised Kosovo. It was also why the French and German governments were so insistent on thwarting US attempts to give Georgia a so-called membership action plan at this year's Nato conference in Bucharest. </p> <p>If Georgia now were a member of Nato, as Saakashvili has pushed for, the military organisation would have a duty to rush to its defence.</p>",
  "<p>Three miles from the nearest shooting butt, a covey of red grouse springs from the heather, nine birds cackling their alarm call \"Go-back, go-back\" as they whirr towards the Pennine horizon.</p> <p>Beyond it, for them, lies an unusual certainty: they will not end up on London dinner plates next Tuesday. For these are birds which live on one of Britain's few grouse moors barred to guns and subject to new, and controversial, \"multi-objective\" management.</p> <p>In stark contrast to famous neighbouring shoots, 53 sq km (20.5 sq mls) of northern Cumbria will be silent apart from birdsong on the Glorious Twelfth. While the shooters' Moorland Association forecasts a mixed bag elsewhere, Geltsdale will be host to ramblers, birds of prey and undisturbed grouse.</p> <p>\"Shooting doesn't play a part here any more,\" says Dr Pat Thompson, uplands conservation officer of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which now occupies the old hunting lodge at Stagsike, with the coat of arms of the aristocratic Lowther family carved above its door. An ally among Geltsdale's previous owners, plus a war chest of legacies, allowed the society to buy the moor before taking over management full-time seven years ago.</p> <p>The inroad into territory long controlled by grouse shooters, including the ruling Maktoum family of Dubai, has upped the stakes in the arguments which swirl round grouse moors, their biodiversity and the threat to birds of prey as the Twelfth approaches every year. Geltsdale's management was attacked this spring by the Countryside Alliance, after a Natural England survey found that the estate had lower bird populations on average than 16 shooting moors in Cumbria. The RSPB hit back that the survey was too small and overlooked factors such as overgrazing which reduced lapwings before the new management approach got under way.</p> <p>\"And what we're doing here is new - and complex,\" says Thompson. \"We don't want a monoculture of heather or of grouse. Many people have a potential interest in the uplands: farmers, foresters, keepers, wildlife enthusiasts, tourists. We are working towards a sustainable way of managing Geltsdale to meet those different needs.\" The RSPB is aggressive to grouse-shooters on the issue of birds of prey, whose unexplained corpses still turn up on shooting moors, but otherwise wants to prove the worth of Geltsdale rather than attack conventional moors. Thompson says: \"We recognise the biodiversity achievements of many shooting moors, and like it or not, their style of intensive grouse moor management is not going to go away.</p> <p>\"But the Moorland Association's own figure, of shooting contributing \u00a312.5m a year to the rural economy, is hardly staggering, compared to the huge economic potential of tourism.\" Geltsdale attracts visitors from the neighbouring honeypots of Hadrian's Wall and the Lake District, and provides jobs - in tenant farming and conservation management - on a comparable scale to a similar-sized grouse moor. But on the reserve, Natural England found low numbers of golden plover, lapwings and other moorland birds, compared with Cumbrian shooting estates. \"Well, we've recorded 96 species breeding on Geltsdale this year,\" says Dave O'Hara, reserve warden for the last five years.</p> <p>The society says its aim is greater diversity rather than ramping up greater numbers of individual species, as can happen with grouse on shooting moors. The approach is in keeping, says O'Hara, with the diverse history of Geltsdale.</p> <p>\"This was the coal mine manager's house,\" he says, as a pair of bizarrely suburban-looking semis appears in the middle of nowhere. \"That slight banking on the moor edge above was the tramway from the mine where Stephenson's Rocket worked in its 'retirement'.\" </p> <p>The Geltsdale experiment is working alongside a second upland study, of a defunct grouse moor in Scotland, where ground-nesting birds have flourished alongside an increase in their predator, the hen harrier. Langholm Moor on the southern border of Dumfries and Galloway is now being managed with an eye to restoring limited grouse-shooting, dependent on the safeguarding of the birds of prey. The project is backed by the RSPB as well as the estate of the Duke of Buccleugh, which owns the land, and the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust. </p> <p>Prof Des Thompson, policy and advice manager for Scottish Natural Heritage, said: \"This is robust science and it is important that this sort of monitoring continues.\" Back on Geltsdale, Pat Thompson agrees. He said: \"The question was posed by David Miliband when he was environment secretary: what are the uplands for? Our moor is going to be part of the answer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, Williamsburg wasn't a place you'd want to be at night. Not only was there little in the way of clubs, bars and restaurants, there was little in the way of cops, streetlights and infrastructure. </p> <p>It was mostly factories and low-income housing. But in the space of a decade the industrial wasteland has gone from artist colony to in-the-know hangout to family neighbourhood, to the extent that it has become something of a hipster Disneyland. The centre of the renaissance is Bedford Avenue where every other store is a coffee shop, bar or American Apparel store. But though Bedford is now as developed as any street in Manhattan, just a few blocks away Williamsburg is still rough around the edges.</p> <p>Along the rocky banks of the East river on Kent Avenue, three blocks east of Bedford, most of the buildings are still vacant. But not for much longer. They are being turned into apartment blocks with names like Edge. Of the remaining warehouses, some are still in business, making wrought iron fixtures or car bumpers, but others have been commandeered by artists, chefs and musicians.</p> <p>South of Bedford, monied arrivistes give way to a long time Puerto Rican and Dominican population, and the exuberance (and cheap rent) that drew the first artists to the area is still palpable. Galleries occupy old deli spaces; new restaurants open every week. The sidewalks are filled with men playing dominoes while feet away young couples suck down oysters. At night, the sound of construction work gives way to the rock'n'roll caterwauling of rooftop parties. Pass an open warehouse door and you might find an avant-garde music ensemble mid-concert or glimpse a film flickering on a wall. By American standards there don't seem to be many rules as to what can and can not transpire. Though east of Manhattan, Williamsburg is New York's wild west. </p> <p><strong>The Glasslands Gallery</strong></p> <p>Opposite the defunct Domino Sugar Factory, housed in an industrial loft on a bleak strip of road, the Glasslands is easy to miss. Don't. A green door leads into a massive space covered in bicycle parts, paintings, murals and rag-tag sofas. The use is as varied as the decor. Up in the balcony, there's a painting room. Downstairs is the bar and a stage. The space hosts events ranging from art exhibitions to gay carnivals to dance performances and concerts. The crowd - invariably hip and sweaty - take advantage of the dirt-cheap booze and the lack of neighbours to whoop and holler.

Inside, disembodied dolls' heads and dead animals preside over a room full of heavily bearded, heavily tattooed metal heads. The jukebox is fully stocked with heavy heavy metal by bands like Possessed and Viking metal legends Amon Amarth. Duff moved his famous Hell's Kitchen Bellevue Bar into this former check cashing joint in 2003 after that Manhattan neighbourhood became too tame for his liking. At his Williamsburg locale, he opened up a year-round patio and a public grill.

The regular menu is small but the list of specials is long and delivered by a waitress who'll sit down with you and scrawl your order on the paper tablecloth. On a recent evening, a halibut special came with fresh corn and cherry tomatoes from a nearby farmers' market.

Hotel Delmano, which opened last year, obliges. With mottled walls, aged mirrors and deep banquettes, Delmano has a 1920s Parisian feel - and the bartenders here are called mixologists. The signature cocktail, made of pear cognac, Cointreau, lemon juice and green Chartreuse, is the Commandant - as deadly as it is delicious.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 82 Berry St (+718 387 1945)</p> <p><strong>Secret Robot Project Space</strong></p> <p>Like the Glasslands, SRPS is more than just a gallery. Though it hosts photography exhibitions and the like, it's better known for its hyperbolic dance parties, experimental art shows and the legendary Secret Robot A/V squad, a crackpot ensemble of audiovisual experts who show up at parties and project trippy films on the wall. Events have ranged from a concert featuring the Yeah Yeah Yeahs to a bakery sale by the guerrilla baking group The Sweet Tooth of the Tiger. With 2,000 square feet and few restrictions of any kind, there's plenty of space to get into trouble.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 210 Kent Avenue (+917 860 8282, <a href=\"http://www.secretprojectrobot.org\">secretprojectrobot.org</a>)</p> <p><strong>Radegast</strong></p> <p>In early December 2007, Vienna came to Williamsburg, in the shape of a massive indoor biergarten, with a menu featuring 32 beers, Viennese sausage and steak tartare.

  "<p>Will you be tempted by \u00a350 cash, a free railcard or a \u00a33,000 overdraft? The banks this week embarked on their annual battle to attract new customers from the 380,000-plus young people starting university this autumn. </p> <p>Competition is fierce for tomorrow's high earners, particularly because they know more than one in four people stick with their bank throughout their working lives. </p> <p>Faced with the plethora of perks, youngsters need to keep a cool head, look behind the gimmicks and consider what really matters when choosing an account to see them through university. However attractive the incentives may be - the five-year railcard worth \u00a3120, giving a third off most UK train fares, offered by NatWest, and the cash handouts from Abbey and Royal Bank of Scotland stand out in the table - it's unwise to choose an account for its perks alone. </p> <p>For most students the interest-free overdraft on offer is likely to be more important, but keep in mind whatever is borrowed must eventually be repaid. </p> <p>Most accounts offer increasing interest-free amounts as the years go on, with a maximum \u00a32,000 available to fifth-year students. </p> <p>For those expecting to borrow bigger amounts, RBS is offering up to \u00a32,750 and Halifax up to \u00a33,000 interest free from day one.</p> <p>Also check the charges you'll incur, should you dip too far into the red. Most banks will agree an authorised overdraft limit over and above the interest-free amount, which you can use to borrow at fairly reasonable rates. But should you go over that limit the banks will charge heavily for straying into unauthorised overdraft territory - and some are less forgiving than others. </p> <p>Abbey's student account, for example, will charge you annual interest at 28.7% plus \u00a325 a month for running up an unauthorised overdraft. On top of this, you'll pay a fee for each transaction - such as debit card payment, cheque or direct debit - that takes you into the unauthorised red. This fee depends on the size of the transaction. </p> <p>Bank charges mount up alarmingly once you stray beyond your authorised limit. Halifax, for example, will charge a \u00a328 monthly fee plus a maximum of \u00a320 a day per transaction that takes you into the red. </p> <p>Some banks are slightly more lenient. Lloyds TSB, for example, waives its fee the first time you go over the limit. But after that its charges roll in at \u00a315 plus up to \u00a320 per day. In other words, go \u00a3100 over your limit and you will be charged more than that in fees in the space of a week. </p> <p>The trick is to make sure you never borrow on your account without asking first and agreeing an authorised limit. </p> <p>When comparing accounts, check out what, if any, interest the bank will pay you when your balance is in credit. Halifax and RBS pay students a consistent 2% credit interest compared with a measly 0.1% from Barclays, Lloyds TSB and NatWest or zero from Co-op Bank, while Abbey pays 4% on balances up to \u00a3500 and HSBC offers 5.84% on balances of up to \u00a31,000 in the first year.</p> <p>Also find out whether there's a branch of your chosen bank, preferably with specialist student advisers on tap, near your university. While all banks now offer online and telephone banking services, it's handy to know you can go and talk face to face if you do encounter a problem. </p> <p>And when it comes to the freebies, consider what will save you money - free travel insurance is useless if you can't afford to go anywhere, for example, as is cheap roadside rescue membership if you don't have a car.</p>",
  "<p>The loafer is a fashion staple, subject to periodic attempts at updating. The most recent is Prada's loafer sandal, which looks like a normal loafer with the front hacked off.

And then disaster struck. I'm pretty sure I saw Jeremy Clarkson wearing a green pair on Top Gear the other week. I've nothing against Jeremy Clarkson - if you feel the urge to be hectored on the subject of how anyone who believes in climate change is a homosexual, by a fat, rightwing Yorkshireman who likes Genesis, he's absolutely your go-to guy - but I don't think it's stretching the point to call him the Typhoid Mary of male style. Millions of people buy his books, but none of them takes a copy to the hairdresser's, points at the cover and goes: \"I want it like that.\" You never see an article headlined Get The Look: Jeremy Clarkson. He wears something in public, you don't: that's the rule of thumb. I suspect that splashing noise in the background might be made by a battalion of Alex Finlay's playboy friends throwing razzy-coloured loafers into the sea.</p>",
  "<p><strong>My Wi-Fi router seems to get 'tired' - every second or third time I go online, internet access is denied, meaning I have to turn it off and on again before it will establish a signal.

Borrow a different model, or Google your model numbers, to see if there is a common issue. If your router has a built-in modem, the chances are that one of the settings is at fault. Working out which one is often a case of trial and error, but if you log into your router's settings (check the manual if you don't know how), you'll be able to dig around.

  "<p>Last night's gala opening ceremony was the first real reminder that the Olympic Games is the stubbed toe, the chopped wind-pipe and the high-speed royal car crash of the sporting calendar. It wants to make you cry. Not just at the obvious bits: the frail, otherworldly singlet-clad creature who collapses like a shotgunned deer after nicking seventh place in the steeplechase. But instantly, gratefully - and all the time. </p> <p>Even the news that the Team GB boxer \"Funtime\" Frankie Gavin has gone home after failing to make his weight left me choking back great salty tears at the thought of his sorry retreat, Lycra thong in hand, from the weighing room, his head-shaking taxi ride to the airport and his moist-eyed trolley sweep through the giant Toblerones in duty-free. In fact, just the name \"Team GB\" makes me feel husky and brave and in need of a group huddle. </p> <p>The Olympics is the only sporting event that does this. Football is happy enough making you feel irritable and vaguely cheated. Cricket leaves you tired, drunk and unsure whether you've actually had dinner or just a boozy tea and lots of snacks. Darts wants you to dance badly to snatches of pop music. Only the Olympics demands tears. And it always gets them. </p> <p>Mainly this is because it's so easy to do. Weeping at the achievements of attractive, smiling people you've never heard of really is a doddle. The key factor is that you don't know who they are, you've got nothing invested in their success and you're fairly confident you'll never see them again. It's the successful friends rule - which states that no significant success achieved by a close or longstanding friend can pass without a tiny part of you quietly dying inside - shifted on to the sporting stage. The same principle applies in reverse to our horribly over-exposed national football teams, who, for some time now, we've quite happily and with some relief watched fail repeatedly. No such problems with the Olympics. You go, rifle-shooting man. Get in there, BMX girl. That's great. Off you pop now.</p> <p>In practice there are three main types of Olympic tears. At entry level, there's the croaky moment. This is reserved for everyday occurrences: the plucky Moroccan pole-vaulter's bright-eyed salute after his third failed ascent; a new Guinean national 100m backstroke record; a flag-draped triple-Kenyan victory lap. Croaky moments usually pass in silence, with just perhaps a tightening of the knuckles on the armchair or a blurred clearing of the throat. </p> <p>Further up the scale we get the uncontrollable sneeze of brave, happy, hot tears. This can be brought on by many things. The slightest glimpse of the marathon. A victorious horse petted by a leaping woman in jodhpurs. Any competitor in any event limping over the line ages after everyone else has finished. An injured sprinter hopping three strides before collapsing with a feeble wave of the arm. Rowers grimacing.</p> <p>At the top end we get the total collapse. Expect to experience just one of these in any Olympics. Best bet this time around might be the frantic final-stage Yngling of the Team GB women as they edge out Belgium for the bronze (and Barry Davies screams \"YES girls! Go ON girls!\"). Pretty much anything involving a really thin person leaping with joy. Or, a personal tip, Paula Radcliffe giving birth to a litter of koalas as she totters across the finish line while a choir of smiling Chinese children sing We Are The World and the Kyrgyzstan beach volleyball team releases a pigeon of peace into the sky. I think I can feel something stirring already.</p>",

I've got some very urgent letters to write and cigarettes to smoke.\"</p> <p>How slowly that afternoon passed as Maxim attended to his important business, and how greatly I felt the weight of Rebecca's presence as I tiptoed through the East Wing. How could I, a mere child, compare to that beautiful creature? Later that evening we went walking in the grounds and Jasper the dog went missing along a secret path.</p> <p>\"Don't follow him,\" Maxim shouted, his voice turning dark and queer. </p> <p>I ignored him, making my way down to a cove where a strange figure combed the beach.</p> <p>\"Get away from Ben the Idiot,\" Maxim said. \"He's just an idiot.\"</p> <p>\"Ooh air, theee oother woman was thair.\"</p> <p>\"Is this where Rebecca drowned?\"</p> <p>\"I knew we should never have got married,\" Maxim said, his voice turning even darker and queerer. \"Now I shall have to go away to write some letters in London.\"</p> <p>The days felt endless without Maxim and the only interruption was the unexpected arrival of a bounder. \"The name's Jack Favell,\" he sneered. \"Rebecca's cousin. And if you'd like a bit of rough and tumble as well . . .\"</p> <p>\"Don't ever mention Mr Favell to Mr de Winter,\" Mrs Danvers said, brushing her fingers through Rebecca's perfumed underwear drawers. \"Just concentrate on making yourself look like that woman in the picture for the Manderley ball.\"</p> <p>\"Get changed at once,\" Maxim said darkly and queerly as I made my entrance.</p> <p>I hid in my room sobbing, waiting for Maxim to join me. He never came. Why had I not realised that Mrs Danvers had dressed me to look like Rebecca? My marriage was over. I could never replace Rebecca in my husband's affections. </p> <p>Two days later Maxim reappeared. Oh joy! \"Let's start again,\" I pleaded. \"I'll be your boy if you don't want me to be your wife.\"</p> <p>\"Everything's changed,\" Maxim said. \"A storm has washed up a boat with Rebecca's body on board. The police will discover that I shot her. You see, I hated her. Everyone thought we had the most perfect marriage but she was a cruel woman who taunted me with her lovers. And although I've always treated you like a child, you're the only woman I've ever loved.\"</p> <p>\"Oh Maxim,\" I answered. \"I don't care if you killed your first wife. Anyone can make a silly mistake. Just kiss me hard and we can make it better.\"</p> <p>\"It's all over,\" said Maxim, writing yet another letter. \"The coroner's verdict was suicide.\"</p> <p>\"That's what you think,\" Favell slurred, helping himself to a whisky and soda. \"Rebecca was my lover and I've got proof you murdered her.\"</p> <p>My blood ran cold, yet I felt a strange elation. At least we would have another night together before Maxim would be hanged for murder. </p> <p>\"Show us your evidence then, you cad,\" Maxim replied.</p> <p>\"Oooh air,\" said Ben the Idiot.</p> <p>\"Rebecca didn't love anyone but me,\" said Mrs Danvers, with a manic Sapphic shrill.</p> <p>\"Well I don't think that proves anything very much,\" said Colonel Julyan the magistrate. \"And as you are very upper class, like me, I'm inclined to believe in your innocence, Maxim. But we should go to London to check out Rebecca's mysterious doctor's appointment.\"</p> <p>\"So, my child,\" Maxim whispered as we drove back to Manderley. \"Rebecca not only had terminal cancer, she also had a deformed uterus. She was goading me to kill her all along.\" </p> <p>\"Oh darling,\" I said. \"I always knew you were only a pretend wife-murderer. And look! Isn't that Manderley on fire? Silly Mrs Danvers. I told her not to read Jane Eyre.\"</p>",
  "<p>By the time the international community realised what was happening, it was already too late. It is like that in the Caucasus, a zone of self-igniting conflicts that burn as fiercely as they do instantly. A day which started with a Georgian military offensive to retake South Ossetia - a pro-Russian enclave they had lost control of 14 years ago - ended with Russian warplanes bombing Georgian airfields. Columns of Russian tanks were headed into Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, and refugees were streaming out.</p> <p>Disentangling claim and counter-claim is as hard as working out the real sequence of events. But there can be little doubt that Georgia's attack with assault troops, multiple-rocket launchers and artillery was a planned military operation. It was not just a reaction to Russian bombing the day before, or a ceasefire that somehow went wrong. The timing of the offensive, when Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was in Beijing for the opening of the Olympic games, was also significant. Georgia may have calculated that Mr Putin might be constrained by the company he was keeping in Beijing, not to order an instant counterattack. </p> <p>Anyone familiar with the history of the region could have predicted that Russia would hit back hard. First, the majority of the 75,000 Ossetians are pro-Russian, and have long been angling to join North Ossetia, which is part of the Russian Federation. Second, many Ossetians have now got Russian citizenship and passports. Third, this is a dispute that predates both the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, and the Putin era. Fourth, rushing to the aid of separatists was a precedent set by the west in Kosovo. Russia gave us fair warning of the consequences.</p> <p>Rather than keep the dispute within a local compass, Mr Saakashvili has done everything in his power to internationalise it. He has banged loudly on Nato's door, and some US leaders have been taken in. The Republican candidate John McCain got a St George's Cross for visiting the Georgian part of South Ossetia last year. The Germans and the French on the other hand resisted Georgia's demand for a membership action plan at the last Nato summit in Bucharest. Georgia's actions yesterday show just how wise Berlin was.</p> <p>Russia is far from blameless. Its official role as peacekeeper in South Ossetia is questionable. It has a history of destabilising independent countries and refusing to accept retreat from empire. But this does not mean that Nato governments should take everything they see at face value. This is not about plucky Georgian democrats versus Russian tyrants. The players in this drama are more devious than that.</p>",

In the case of today's friend, however, I am unilaterally waiving his right to privacy as a penalty for the repellent tale he will insist on reiterating whenever we eat together.</p> <p>Anthony Holden may be familiar to you as Observer music reviewer, biographer of royal and literary figures or arguably the finest writer on poker there has yet been. He is all these and more, but it is solely as culinary anecdotist that he concerns us here.</p> <p>\"Is there any cheese in the fish pie?\" he asked a very sweet and patient South African waitress at The Gun, a proper old boozer on the banks of the Thames where Admiral the Lord Nelson used to give Lady Hamilton a jolly rogering upstairs. Anthony had been banging on about this place for some time, eulogising the joys of travelling to it by boat from Westminster as much as those of eating al fresco under giant parasols on a pretty terrace bang opposite the erstwhile Millennium Dome. In fact, so excited had I been about trying it out that I arrived for our lunch exactly one day early, and it is to the staff's credit that they didn't point and snort on my return.</p> <p>\"Yes, sir, there's some stilton in the potato topping,\" replied our waitress, showing the same rigid professionalism, \"but I can ask the chef to leave it out.\" </p> <p>\"If you would,\" Anthony said, visibly blanching. \"I have a phobia about cooked cheese, you see, because...\" </p> <p>\"Shut it!\" I hurriedly chimed in. \"She doesn't need to hear that.\" </p> <p>Nor do you, really, not least because it has featured in this column before. But for those of you who may have missed it then, it concerns how at boarding school, every Wednesday lunch without fail for five years, Anthony brought up his macaroni cheese and was forced to drop to all fours and ingest every morsel again.</p> <p>Who knows if this is the literal truth? It sounds demented, yet knowing a little of remote English public schools in the days before political correctness went mad, who's to say that the man now known to our poker school as Tony Macaroni isn't telling the God's honest?</p> <p>As the waitress went off with the order, I did what any alarmingly puerile, middle-aged man would have done. I followed her and offered \u00a320 if she could see her way to forgetting the special request. Despite my reassurance that we were sitting next to a rail over which Anthony could very easily chuck on to the river bank without being noticed, she rejected the bribe.</p> <p>About what subsequently made its way to the table, there was nothing to foment even the queasiest of gastric juices. I'd wanted to try A Grelha, the Portuguese barbecue they do here during the summer, but for meteorological reasons this wasn't available, and we gladly stuck with the conventional but appealing modern Brit/gastro-pub menu.</p> <p>Macaroni was delighted with his starter in which strips of smoked eel and pancetta were prettily intertwined, and served with quail's egg and horseradish cream. \"It's great,\" said Macaroni, \"especially the lovely, runny egg.\" My pea soup was excellent, too, bursting with the clean, luscious flavour of freshly shelled pea, and would have been magnificent had it not been slightly too sweet for my acidic taste.</p> <p>The tension as the main courses arrived was almost too much for me. Between courses, I had nipped out back a second time, doubling the bribe to \u00a340, and half-believed that this had done the trick. So the grin of pleasure that spread over Anthony's face as the first mouthful of fish pie went down - and stayed down - acted on my spirits like a medicine ball to the solar plexus. </p> <p>\"I can't say a word against this - prawns, salmon, smoked haddock, all fresh and delicious, and not the faintest hint of you know what.\" My spring chicken, at the top of a mound featuring layers of black pudding, spinach and potato r\u00f6sti, was a vast, crispy-skinned portion of a decent bird, and a fine, solid dish, even if the meat was very slightly dry.</p> <p>Minor embarrassment ensued when the waitress, lured into assuming that Anthony had finished the pie by the fag glowing in his hand, tried to remove the plates. I hadn't seen anyone simultaneously smoke and eat since my grandfather some 35 years ago, and with tiny flakes of haddock clearly visible in his Benson &amp; Hedges plumes, I momentarily eyed the puking rail myself. </p> <p>After that, we shared a delectably sharp and zingy lemon posset, and all too soon we were off. The Gun is a very slick operation, if not a wilfully underpriced one, and just the sort of languid setting that makes you want to sit drinking until sundown. However, a Wednesday lunchtime with Tony Macaroni had passed with the regurgitation of nothing more than the anecdote itself, and this was not the time to push one's luck.</p> <h2>The bill</h2> <p>Pea soup \u00a35.50</p> <p>Smoked eel \u00a38</p> <p>Spring chicken \u00a315.50</p> <p>Fish pie \u00a314.50</p> <p>Spring greens \u00a34.50</p> <p>Lemon posset \u00a35.50</p> <p>2 glasses merlot \u00a311.20</p> <p>1 glass pinto grigio \u00a36.40</p> <p>Americano \u00a32</p> <p>Subtotal \u00a373.10</p> <p>Service @ 12.5% \u00a39.13</p> <p><strong>Total \u00a382.23</strong></p>",
  "<p>The zany title of Mary Ann Shaffer's first and, alas, last novel derives from an invented book club on the island of Guernsey in the second world war. The club is invented by the resourceful character Elizabeth McKenna, who, bumping into a German patrol after curfew with a crowd of revellers, makes the society up on the spot. In reality, the tipsy party had been consuming forbidden roast pig at Amelia Maugery's. This is less a historical novel than a bibliophilic jeu d'esprit by an ex-librarian and bookseller, posthumously published, and completed by her niece Annie Barrows. </p> <p>A novel in letters about books, bibliophiles, publishers, authors and readers, it centres on an imagined post-occupation Guernsey. Juliet Ashton, the whimsical, intuitive heroine, is an up-and-coming writer. While casting about for a new subject, she hears from a Guernsey pig farmer, Adam Dawsey, who has found Juliet's name and address in a second-hand copy of Charles Lamb's essays. From this fragile contact grows a web of correspondents, who feed Juliet's obsession with wartime Guernsey and the tragicomic interwoven stories of its people.</p> <p>Madeleine Bunting's The Model Occupation of 1996 revealed, to uproar, the extent of Channel Island collaboration with the deportation of 2,000 British subjects to Nazi Europe. Seen in this light, Shaffer's novel seems a version of pastoral, thronging with lovable people (or perhaps a version of piscatory, for the islanders were fishermen in a maritime world). But we remain aware that \"Europe is like a hive broken open, teeming with thousands upon thousands of displaced people, all trying to get home\". Exuberance is seamed with distress, and a vein of pastoral elegy centres on the lovely and exhilarating character of Elizabeth, Juliet's alter ego. </p> <p>Her narrative is a weave of bright and dark, threading through the gentle humour of the islanders' stories. Elizabeth embodies a comic law of the novel: the more inventive and intuitive a person is, the more pregnant her actions will be and the greater her charm, in the deepest sense of that word. Elizabeth is a fugitive presence in the novel; she exists in the tissue of communal memory evoked by the letters.</p> <p>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society commemorates beautiful spirits who pass through our midst and hunker undercover through brutal times. Shaffer's Guernsey characters step from the past radiant with eccentricity and kindly humour, a comic version of the state of grace. They are innocents who have seen and suffered, without allowing evil to penetrate the rind of decency that guards their humanity. Their world resembles Shakespeare's Ephesian or Illyrian comedies; but its territory incorporates both Elysium and Hades. \"Prove true, Imagination, oh prove true,\" pleads Viola in Twelfth Night - and, sure enough, a brother is delivered from the sea. </p> <p>Guernsey's dead will not return. Shaffer's writing, with its delicately offbeat, self-deprecating stylishness, is exquisitely turned, bearing a clear debt to Jane Austen. She shows, in addition, an uncanny ability to evoke period, miming its manners and mannerisms - not only in the reminders of blitzed London but also in recreating a culture that reveres books. </p> <p>This is at the heart of the novel's golden comedy. The rarity of books in 1946 reminds us of an age we have lost, of stint and thrift combined with greater amplitude of time. In such a culture, hand-written letters are precious personal gifts. Each book, meeting and letter has value, commands affectionate attention, and never comes cheap. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stevie Davies's The Eyrie is published by Phoenix</p>",
  "<p><strong>The family</strong></p> <p>My two daughters have been hassling us to buy chickens. A neighbour has some, so why not us? Dora, seven, is obsessed. She already has a bedroom full of toy hens and ducks, so the real-life version, in her mind, is the obvious next step. Martha, 10, does not go in for her sister's fluffy excesses, but is right behind her when it comes to proper poultry. Hannah, who has always had aspirations to lead the good life, is egging them on. </p> <p>We grow vegetables and in theory I like the idea of producing more of our own food (eggs, not meat). But I need to be convinced. I tell the girls that chickens, unlike turkeys, are not just for Christmas (they don't find this funny). Like any other pet, they will live for years, will need constant looking-after, and that includes dreary jobs such as cleaning up their muck. </p> <p>But they are not easily deterred. To be honest, I can see the appeal of poultry. Obviously, there are the fresh eggs - you can expect 250 a year from each hen - but chickens have other uses. They will contribute to a healthy garden by eating slugs and will happily gobble up scraps and the remains of meals. Compared to our guineapigs, who bite you, hide from their own shadows and poo in their food dish, there is a point to chickens. </p> <p>So we agree to give it a go, but on the understanding that it will be a trial run. A couple of weeks' probation should do it: if the chickens become a burden in that time, they will just have to go. </p> <p><strong>The training</strong></p> <p>Our chicken-keeping is mostly to be learned on the job. Chickens, according to books, websites and local poultry fanciers, are easy. And once word gets round the village that we are in the market for some, neighbours pitch in with more tips. </p> <p>We visit Will, to see what we can learn from his set up. Like him, we are hoping to let our hens wander round the place when we are in the garden and go into their enclosed run when we are not around. But in the past he has been slack about this and the fox has killed the lot, taking only one away, leaving the rest for Will to clean up.</p> <p>I think of the fox who sunbathes brazenly on our garage roof. Our coop and run, therefore, must be impregnable - not the romantic image we had of free-range fowl wandering our garden, but better than carnage. </p> <p>There are plenty of specialist coop suppliers, though a decent one won't be cheap. Ours is made locally and comes with a little skirt of fencing that is laid horizontally around it to stop predators digging underneath. </p> <p>With the coop in place, we are ready for the chickens. Another neighbour says we don't need a cockerel, unless we are planning to fertilise our eggs for breeding and wake next door at night (it's a myth that they only crow at dawn). Neither, we are advised, should we get novelty breeds such as those with fluffy legs - the hen's equivalent of a cowboy's chaps get filthy in winter and are a breeding ground for mites. Hybrids are recommended because they lay large numbers of eggs, but pure breeds are reputed to be tougher and more disease resistant. Our poultry-fancying friends advise that we should go for the latter.</p> <p>After scanning the small ads, we find a lady in a nearby village with Buff Sussex pullets to sell, who are about one month off \"point of lay\" (18 weeks old). They are a lovely golden colour, with dark collars and wing tips and, according to one book, a perfect breed for beginners. We practise holding Penny and Rosie, hands around each wing so they don't flap. They are hen-size but still make the chirping sound you associate with chicks. The combination has the girls delirious. </p> <p>Betty and Hilda are slightly older and come from a different source - a man who explains that he can tell they are ready to lay because of the deep red colour of their combs and wattles. Betty is a speckled blue-black Cuckoo Marans, Hilda a Light Sussex. </p> <p>We have timed our purchases for the weekend, so we can hang out all day while the chickens get used to their new home. After a night in the coop, we let them out to explore the garden and I find myself warming to them straight away. They are very sociable, the whole gang hanging around if you are weeding the borders (or are they looking for worms?). They don't seem to mind being picked up and cuddled, either, although Dora's over-enthusiasm has got her pecked a few times.</p> <p>At the hen house, a pecking order has been established that seems to have been fairly bloodless. Betty rules the roost, blocking the door when the fancy takes her and always first to the food. But things are relatively harmonious - I peeked in at dusk the other night and they were all cuddled together, daytime differences forgotten. </p> <p>Our first two weeks have flown by, with the children getting up early to check on the hens even before CBBC goes on in the morning. We are still learning about their care, but muddling through doesn't seem to have harmed them. As I write, one has just begun laying and we are now the owners of three smallish brown eggs. We think it is Betty, the Cuckoo Marans and leader of our new flock.

You can find out more about burping - and a few other things - on Burp Day at the Science Museum in London today. </p> <p>The Punk Scientists will be helping out with a science show led by Glenn Murphy, the former chief explainer at the museum, whose new book, How Loud Can You Burp?

Why not a sausage or a chicken?\" they mocked. But those lampooning laughs soon turned to \"Gis a go!\" when I hoisted a mighty pinchy beast from the depths. \"We're gonna need more bacon,\" said one, in much the same way Roy Scheider ponders the need for a bigger boat in Jaws. </p> <p>Crabbing is a great way to lose a couple of hours on the coast and if, like my clan, you think it's all to do with the skilful positioning and lowering of the line into water rather than sheer pot luck, why not try your hand at the British Open Crabbing Championship in Suffolk tomorrow?

Our challenge: an ingenious maize maze. Armed with a flag on a pole (sensibly supplied so staff can find and rescue visitors if need be), we set out into the corn along tracks that were not so much paths as mud slides. As the rain bucketed down, staying upright became a bigger challenge than finding our way. It didn't matter. We were happy just being out in the countryside, lost to the world, slip-sliding this way and that, getting covered in mud. If we made it out by teatime, well, that was fine.</p> <p>There are only a couple of months between the corn being high enough to hide in and harvest time, but happily that coincides with the school holidays and there are maize mazes the length and breadth of Britain, from Cornwall to Stirling, Pembrokeshire to Norfolk.

However short your child's attention span, they are pretty much guaranteed to see something.</p> <p>Meteors are flashes of light caused by particles of dust burning up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, about 60 miles above our heads. In the case of the Perseids, these particles were originally part of the Swift-Tuttle comet. They've been visible for a couple of weeks but are expected to peak on Monday night and Tuesday morning (August 11-12). The best time to look out for them will be just before dawn, when the moon will have set and our side of the Earth will be moving directly into the cloud of debris.

  "<p>Given that the A-level results are only this week hitting doormats, it might seem odd to start talking about holiday work for Christmas and next summer - but it is the students that apply first that will get the pick of the jobs. </p> <p>Students looking for work over this summer's long vacation are complaining that well-paid work has been hard to come by.</p> <p>A combination of bigger student numbers, the influx of immigrant workers from eastern Europe and a decline in manufacturing in the UK has left cash-starved students struggling for work. </p> <p>This week the Guardian reported that some had been forced to take increasingly unorthodox work. The paper featured physics student Pete Edmunds, who spent his summer working as a near-naked butler serving hen nights in a bid to bring in some cash. </p> <p>University careers advisers have long praised the merits of vacation work, even if it is no more complicated than bar work or shelf stacking. Any work experience, they argue, demonstrates to employers that you have a responsible attitude to work and that you have experienced life beyond academic institutions.</p> <p>With most students looking for something close to home during the Christmas and Easter holidays, the current advice is to get in early this year. Temping agencies are already reporting a reduction in work available. In the pre-Christmas rush, agencies that supply retailers and warehouses will probably be the best bet, along with bars and supermarkets. </p> <p>However, it is the long summer holiday that gives students an opportunity to spread their wings and make some cash. </p> <p>Susan Griffith, an expert on foreign summer work and author of Work Your Way Around the World, says students need to start thinking about summer vacation work just after Christmas.</p> <p>\"There are loads of opportunities out there particularly if you speak languages other than English. Each year hotels in Switzerland need staff and Eurocamp takes on thousands of students. The trick is to find work that fits in with the end of the summer term.\" </p> <p>She says working as a counsellor at the American summer camps with the likes of Bunac and Camp America are justifiably popular. Bunac starts taking applications from students looking to work in US summer camps from November.</p> <p>\"A lots of the farming jobs - picking fruit etc - have largely been taken by workers from eastern Europe, but there still is plenty of work out there. In June and July lots of young people descend on Denmark to pick strawberries. Although the season is quite short, the wages are good.\" But Griffith also has a word of warning: \"Be wary if you are offered what looks like a dream job - waiting on dinners in a Greek bar - it may turn out that you only get tips.\" </p> <p>Students looking for jobs abroad should check out a directory of possible work, Summer Jobs Worldwide (\u00a312.99 from Crimson Publishing).

I find them by asking the right questions and using meticulous search techniques. I take a Dictaphone with a recording of the owner's voice. A cat hears that and meows. Ferrets are harder to find. Tortoises don't go far quickly, but they do go missing. I know to check sheds for cats, parkland and the backs of takeaway shops for dogs, and I always speak to as many people as possible. Children often know what's happening in a neighbourhood.</p> <p>I spend every day searching. This job gives me happiness. There were 70 cats reported missing while I was on my honeymoon. Even then I was thinking up new ideas and better search techniques. I was seriously ill with mental illness years ago and ended up living in my car. I had to fight to put my life back together and now I've got two kids, a lovely wife and the opportunity to find a lot of pets.</p> <p>It may sound bizarre, but people can be happy to hear the bad news, too. It's a massive relief. When a pet is missing, an owner's life falls apart. They've lost a member of their family. I know what that unhappiness feels like: if my dog went missing, I'd sell everything to find her.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I am a 17-year-old student on a gap year and was wondering what are the risks, if any, of occasional use of MDMA?</strong></p> <p>MDMA, or ecstasy, is methylenedioxymethamphetamine. It was used by the German army in the first world war in an attempt to calm soldiers' fears before they went into battle. However, it was quickly discontinued because of its horrendous effects (I hesitate to call them side-effects because they are the main effects of the drug). MDMA stimulates serotonin release from brain nerve cells, giving a 'high' for a few hours. Unfortunately, it also damages those nerve cells - serotonin helps to regulate mood, memory, sleep and appetite, so even if you take just a few E tablets, you run a risk of permanent damage to these vital processes. </p> <p>And, of course, there are many cases now of sudden death due to excessive temperature rises (hyperthermia) at raves. I worry why you're even considering putting such a dangerous substance into your body. Please don't do it.</p> <p><strong>Which is it better for your blood pressure to have around the house - a pet or a spouse?</strong></p> <p>Are you ready for this answer? People with pets have lower heart rates and blood pressure when subjected to stress (such as mental arithmetic problems) than people who do not have them. It is the other way around with a spouse - asked to do arithmetic in front of a partner, blood pressure and heart rate rise faster and more steeply than they would if you were holding your pet. Presumably this may have something to do with the fact that you are not worried that your dog or cat will criticise if you get an answer wrong.</p> <p><strong>I am 43 and trying to conceive naturally. How long should I give it before I try IVF?</strong></p> <p>By the age of 43, whether or not you are likely to conceive depends largely on whether or not you are still ovulating. You can easily check that, though - just ask your doctor to do a hormone profile (this takes the form of a simple blood test).</p> <p>If you are still ovulating, then you should be able to conceive - provided, of course, your partner is fertile, too. If you aren't ovulating, however, then it's more difficult - your doctor will guide you through the steps that can then be taken.</p> <p>That said, at age 43, you will have to accept that pregnancy and labour are more difficult, and carry more risk to you and the baby than they do at 23.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you have a question for Dr Smith?

  "<p><strong>Myth: You don't need a TV licence</strong></p> <p>One of the greatest student myths is that you don't need a TV licence at college, particularly in halls of residence. </p> <p>Last year, TV detector vans caught 1,000 people a day - many of them students who mistakenly believed they would be covered by the parent's licence. Anyone using a TV or other device that is capable of watching programmes \"as they are broadcast\" - and that includes laptops - has to buy a licence. These now cost \u00a3139.50 a year for colour, or \u00a347 for a black and white set - if you can still find one. Get caught without a licence and you risk prosecution and a fine of up to \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Students in halls don't need a licence to watch a TV in the communal rooms. However, if you have one in your room, you do.</p> <p>Those who have moved on to shared houses also need one. Incredibly, the licensing people say that those who live in the same shared house, but have separate tenancy agreements, each need their own licence.</p> <p>But if you download programmes off BBC iPlayer, or only watch previously broadcast programmes, you do not need a licence. Watching TV on a mobile phone is also exempt - so long as the equipment is battery operated. Curiously, this exemption only applies if your parents have a licence and you live at home outside term time.</p> <p>Recent graduates tell Money that licensing staff actively target student halls, and other areas in which there lots of student digs. If you are not staying at university over the summer and do not need your licence again, you are entitled to a refund of any unused quarters (three full calendar months). </p> <p>Contact TV Licensing on 0844 800 6734 or <a href=\"http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/students2008\">tvlicensing.co.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Myth: You can use bankruptcy to escape your student loan</strong></p> <p>It used to be that graduates could declare bankruptcy, walk away from student debts and be \"discharged\" within a year or two - but no longer. From September 2004, even if you declare yourself bankrupt, your student loan stays with you. The Student Loans Company revealed this week that it is obliged to consider an application for an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA), but usually turns them down unless the circumstances are \"exceptional\".</p> <p>You don't have to repay your loan if you earn less than \u00a315,000 a year - and if that continues through your life, the debt is cancelled at age 65 - or if declared unfit to work through disability. </p> <p>Leaving aside the morality of bankruptcy, those desperate enough can, technically, take out conventional loans, pay off their student loan and declare themselves bankrupt.</p> <p>\"I really wouldn't advise it - particularly if you plan to go into one of the professions, because you'll be finished before you've even started,\" says PricewaterhouseCoopers' director of personal insolvency, Chris Turner. He adds that former bankrupts generally have an impaired credit record for six years, making credit of any sort - including mortgages - hard to come by, although the actual bankruptcy is usually discharged in a year.</p> <p>\"If you have any assets these will be generally seized. If you inherited some money during the year, that would be taken, although your normal furniture and battered old car would be untouched. If you have plans to go into the law, accountancy and the like, bankruptcy is not an option. If you're planning to be a potter its implications are less serious, but I still wouldn't advise it,\" he says.</p> <p>Students who leave the UK after completing their course are unable to avoid loan repayments. \"The debts will be waiting for you when you get back,\" said a spokesman for the company. \"Normal debt rules - dissolving them after six years - don't apply to student loans,\" he warns. </p> <p><strong>Myth: You can insure your car at your parents' address</strong></p> <p>For years, students taking a car to university could get away with insuring it in their mum's name and disappearing off to college. Not any more.</p> <p>Insurers will no longer tolerate this practice of \"fronting\". If you, the student, own the car, or are considered its main driver, you need a policy in your own name - with a premium to match. If the policy is in the name of a parent and the insurer finds out it has been on campus all year rather than outside the parental home, it may refuse to pay in the event of a claim. Again, thefts from university car parks are common.</p> <p>Students looking for cheap car cover will struggle. However, if you won't be put off, insurance broker Swinton offers six-month policies, aimed at new drivers, which give a 30% discount (if no claim has been made) on a full year's renewal. It says this could bring down premiums for the first 18 months by about a third.</p> <p><strong>Myth: You will spend all your money on beer</strong></p> <p>While we are not going to pretend they have stopped going out, students spend the biggest proportion of their income on accommodation.</p> <p>According to a NatWest survey this week, the average student will spend \u00a370 a week on rent during 2008, against \u00a328 on booze and the \u00a321 they spend on food in supermarkets. </p> <p>Cigarettes, says NatWest, cost the average scholar \u00a314 a week, more than the \u00a39 a week spent on books and other course materials. They spend \u00a39 a week on mobile phone and other phone costs. Laundry and dry cleaning takes \u00a34 a week. </p> <p>Students at Newcastle are the kings of , spending an average of \u00a339 a week on this, against \u00a317 at relatively abstemious Dundee. NatWest claims students at British universities will spend \u00a3864m this year on going out - a significant sum, but dwarfed by the \u00a33.9bn they will spend on housing.</p> <p><strong>Myth: You don't have to pay tax on money you earn</strong></p> <p>Students have to pay income tax just like everybody else. But because many have combined earnings and savings interest below the annual \"personal allowance\" - \u00a36,035 - they will pay nothing. Anything above \u00a36,035 is taxed at 20%. </p> <p>Students who work during term-time have to pay income tax via Pay As You Earn - they can reclaim any tax overpaid at the end of the tax year. But those working only in vacations and who are sure their income will not top \u00a36,035 in the tax year should ask the employer for form P38(S) so they can be paid tax free.</p> <p>Students have to pay National Insurance at 11% whenever weekly earnings top \u00a3105 even if they pay no income tax. This cannot be reclaimed. </p> <p><strong>Myth: You need to insure your stuff at university</strong></p> <p>You do, but you can put it put on your parents' home insurance.</p> <p>Students are prime targets for burglars, according to the Home Office. Student houses and halls of residence are magnets because they tend to be packed with easily liftable laptops, iPods, phones and games consoles. Your landlord is only likely to have buildings insurance so contents cover is essential.</p> <p>Peter Gerrard at <a href=\"http://www.Moneysupermarket.com\">Moneysupermarket.com</a>, says most insurers let parents cover offsprings' belongings while they're at college. \"Generally home policies offer about \u00a33,000 of cover outside the home, but you need to check the policy's small print. Students have so much kit these days it's easy to exceed this sum, so make sure you've got sufficient cover.\" He warns that parents of students making a claim will lose any no-claims discount, which could cost more in the long run. </p> <p>For about \u00a350 a year you can buy a \u00a34,000 standalone policy. Gerrard recommends E&amp;L's student cover (<a href=\"http://www.eandl.co.uk\">eandl.co.uk</a>). <a href=\"http://www.endsleigh.co.uk\">Endsleigh.co.uk</a> is another student favourite.</p> <p>Halifax home insurance was this week advising students to consider security when looking at places to rent. It also advises them to photograph their valuables and to keep all receipts, invoices and photos in a safe place.</p>",
  "<h2>Gullible need help, but so do other victims </h2> <p>A fool and his money are soon parted but, as Patrick Collinson pointed out in his column (July 26), even fools ought to be alerted to scams. So I applaud your continuing to publicise the Spanish lottery scam that lures people into sending money to fraudsters. </p> <p>But think about it. The lady quoted as calling Tony Levene admitted she hadn't bought a ticket. So what was she thinking? That some mistake had put her in touch with someone else's winnings? Is that different, except in scale, from finding an anonymous wallet in the street and keeping the contents? </p> <p>People will always want to buy fake diamonds, cheap bank shares and lotto tickets in the hope of making a quick fortune. Good luck to them, but it's their choice. </p> <p>Shouldn't we focus on the innocents who do not have enough to live on - pensioners who by no fault of their own can't afford their fuel bills, asylum seekers who aren't allowed to work to support themselves, disabled people whose employer (Remploy) is being closed, poor people forced to use pre-pay fuel meters, to mention a few? </p> <p>There's a proposal to compensate Northern Rock shareholders. Whatever happened to the risk premium? I even heard a few weeks ago that the police are setting up a taskforce to look at boiler-room share scams. These plans seem like a waste of taxpayers' money. Individuals with more money than sense should be allowed to spend it how they wish. </p> <p>Is this being heartless? Maybe, but we need to get our priorities right. <br><strong>Richard Cooper</strong><br>Southampton</p> <h2>It's not only families that are hard working</h2> <p>Just a note to say thanks to The Reporter column for the comment at the end of \"You read it here first\" (Money Guardian, August 2). I'm a moderator on a website for child-free people and one of our bugbears is the media emphasis on \"hard-working families\", to the seeming exclusion of singles and couples without children.</p> <p>It's not only the Daily Mail - the government is probably the worst offender.

The appeal was dismissed.</p> <p>Surely the rail companies' actions in imposing what amounts to an on-the-spot fine for an oversight is completely unfair and against all natural justice. After all, a motorist who is asked to show a driving licence is asked to produce it at a police station within a given period, not given a spot fine because he or she does not have it with them.</p> <p>I am left with the impression the rail companies' only interest is to make as much money as they can. <br><strong>Chris Chapman</strong><br>Via email</p> <h2>Selective bailouts unfair to rest of us</h2> <p>So now the government is ploughing millions into Northern Rock, while an ombudsman has decided people who have put their money with Equitable Life also need to be compensated.</p> <p>I haven't heard anything about people like myself - who have a life insurance policy which is looking bleaker and bleaker - being compensated.

The thieves were apprehended red-handed, with the car, by the police and it was impounded. I never used it again. Having done their forensic examination, the police handed the car over to another garage for examination by my insurers, Lloyds TSB. A loss adjuster told me the car could not be repaired and offered me \u00a3800, about two-thirds of its book value. The claim went back to be handled in Ipswich. The claims office requested I provide photocopies of my licence, log book, MOT, etc, and also of my wife's licence because she was nominated as a second driver.</p> <p>My wife had driven my car once, last century. Having her as second driver was a contingency in case I became ill. However, in 2004, about a year before the commencement of my policy with Lloyds TSB, my wife incurred a speeding fine while driving her own car. As soon as the office handling my claim received the information about my wife's speeding offence, their attitude became adversarial. I had failed to disclose my wife's speeding offence. Having deducted, understandably, the excess of \u00a3100, they requested backdated premiums for each of the three previous years of my insurance with Lloyds TSB, with an administration charge of \u00a315 for each year, which amounted to about \u00a3180. At one point they threatened to not honour my claim at all.</p> <p>Eventually, they agreed to waive the administration charges, so the extra cost was reduced by \u00a345. </p> <p>Because I have better things to do than spend even more time following this up - writing letters, telephoning, complaining to my local branch of Lloyds TSB - I accepted about \u00a3550. I was able to buy myself a pushbike. I am left with a belief that I was the victim of stealing from two directions. </p> <p>The sad druggies who drove off in my stole from me and so, in my view, did Lloyds TSB which, with much more calculation and sophistication, knew how to beat down a claim to incur as little loss as possible and protect profits. <br><strong>David JK Evans</strong><br>Via email</p> <h2>Footing the bill for meter mistakes</h2> <p>I am 85, live alone and use only electricity.

Since I had long turned off the heating, it was obviously wrong. After complaining, I have now received a bill for less than half that amount. </p> <p>If I had paid the original bill, Southern Electric would now be collecting interest on the overpayment until such time as the account was in balance again - three months away at least. </p> <p>I have old bills to show this has happened regularly to me. Multiplied across the country this would be a nice little earner for the company. </p> <p>Another little earner occurred with a price rise between bills. The company underestimated the units used at the old rate and overestimated those at the new one.

However, the unfairness caused by this arrangement is not new, it having been a feature of the old housing benefit regime.

  "<p>Historically the VW Passat has gained a reputation as a car that's comfortable, smooth, easy to drive and inoffensive to the eye. In short, everything that a manager of a car fleet company could want. Its single, inescapable problem has been that it isn't an Audi.</p> <p>It didn't matter how much it resembled its stablemate, or how many components it shared, it was never quite an Audi - in the way, for example, that Avram Grant was never quite Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. The new Passat CC is also comfortable, smooth and easy to drive, but it doesn't look much like an Audi. Indeed, it doesn't look much like a Passat.</p> <p>What it looks like is a classy version of the kind of vehicle that American car hire firms seem to stock in their \"mid-range\" to the exclusion of all else. They are ostensibly saloons with a reclining rear that seeks to appear sporty but actually just looks like a truncated trunk. With American hire cars, the impression is accurate because there's usually only enough room in the boot to fit your passport. By contrast, the Passat's boot could take your luggage and still have room for a dead body.</p> <p>It's a roomy car all round, with generous rear seat space, but only for four. There's no central seating area in the back. Instead there is sufficient drink-holding space to host a neighbourhood coffee morning, or perhaps a board meeting.</p> <p>And, as you would expect, there's all manner of Germanic safety designs, from \"whiplash-optimised head restraints\" to multifaceted collision protection. Along with GPS, push-button ignition and Bluetooth phone link, these features are all deemed executive essentials nowadays. After all, the busy middle manager doesn't have time to turn a key, much less look where he or she is going when getting down to the real business of driving - talking on the mobile phone.</p> <p>And no longer does a tight schedule allow for unnecessary stress in parking. Thus the Passat CC comes with Volkswagen's \"Park Assist\" system. You press a button, stick the indicator on for which side of the street you want to park, and sensors alert you to when to stop. From there all you have to do is stick the gears in reverse and the steering goes on to autopilot.</p> <p>Like those drugs that enable you to eat without putting on weight, this is really a form of cheating. The only driving skill left in the era of automatics, powered steering and cruise control is parking. Any fool can drive a car. It's parking that matters. That's what separates the men from those who get their exercise by walking from the car to the pavement.</p> <p>Volkswagen's intervention in the contract between driver, machine and society at large is surely a step too far. At the moment, one of the main obstacles preventing many people from driving is parking. Not because they'll get a ticket. There are legions of drivers who dream of manoeuvring themselves into a position - ie, a parking space - whereby they'd qualify for a ticket. Do we really want these people on the road? Volkswagen seems to think so.</p> <p>As a result, driving the new Passat CC is an experience almost entirely devoid of anxiety.

  "<p>Holly Campbell graduated last year with a degree in English literature from the University of Warwick. She is interested in working in human resources. \"I have been working as a PA since I graduated which has given me a good grounding in business,\" she says. \"I chose my degree subject because I enjoyed the subject but I think it was good preparation for any career. I can see myself in HR on a long-term basis.\"</p> <p>Campbell is also drawn to working for a large business. \"I like the commercial and corporate environment,\" she says. \"I like seeing how business strategy and the mechanics of an operation come together and being part of that. And there are usually opportunities for good career development.\" </p> <p>She relishes the idea of working with other people. \"You meet some great people in a big organisation,\" she says, \"and I'm a people person.\"</p> <p>We asked Lawrence Carter, head of HR strategy at Reed in Partnership to mock interview Campbell for an entry-level job. </p> <p>Reed in Partnership's main role is to provide services to government - it works alongside the recruitment and training divisions of the Reed organisation. But Carter says that no matter what the company does, the basic aim of HR is always the same. \"Overall, it's about creating, implementing and managing efficient processes to ensure a happy workforce,\" he says. Beyond that, the precise functions of different HR departments can vary, but might include administrative services, overseeing changes in location, for example, learning and development, compensation, benefits and rewards and recruitment. </p> <p>\"The first thing that someone who wants to work in HR needs,\" says Carter, \"is the CIPD [Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development] qualification. It's not necessarily a requirement for entry but at some stage you've got to get it if you want to progress.\" </p> <p>While some degree programmes do offer the CIPD qualification, the majority of people get it through training while already in work, either sponsored by their employer or as part of a graduate training programme.</p> <p>\"As well at that, you've got to have an interest in the business you're working within,\" says Carter. \"You have to have the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple terms. You have to be persuasive and be able to juggle a large number of different elements to your job. You've got to be hands-on and able to spot potential HR issues going on around you and react to them. And you've got to be willing to learn, because a lot of complex employment law underpins HR.\"</p> <p>Campbell scored highly in the interview. \"She was very clear and articulate, concise, positive and enthusiastic,\" says Carter. \"We like to ask competency-based questions and her work experience meant she had relevant answers to draw on. She was very well prepared.</p> <p>\"If I was going to offer any advice it would be to develop a slightly more nuanced answer about why she wants to work in HR,\" Carter continues. \"She talked in quite general terms to begin with, though when I questioned her more closely it was clear that she does have a good idea of what HR is about. But overall she is a very strong, employable candidate and would make a great addition to a team.\"</p> <p>Campbell felt that her preparation had stood her in good stead. \"I'm quite well prepped on interview technique.\" She didn't feel unable to answer any of the questions. \"Lawrence asked me quite a lot about HR,\" she says, \"but that was good because it was challenging. It was good to be able to have a discussion about the issues involved.\"</p> <p>Overall, she felt the interview went well. \"I thought it was positive,\" she says. It has also reinforced her interest in HR as a career. \"I'm even considering applying for the Reed graduate training scheme.\" </p> <p><strong>Questions asked:</strong></p> <p>- What attracts you to HR?<br>- How can HR support a business?<br>- Is HR about process or peopple?<br>- Give an example of a time you explained a complex concept in easy-to-understand terms.<br>- Is HR a neutral arbiter or a dogged defender of a company against employment tribunals?</p> <p><strong>Scorecard:</strong><br>Presentation 8/10; Preparation 8/10; Employability 8/10</p> <p>- If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to<a href=\"mailto:graduate@theguardian.com\"> graduate@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>One afternoon a few weeks ago, as John Leslie was on his way to an antique watch shop in Edinburgh, his mobile phone rang. It was his ex-lawyer, calling to warn him that the police in London were looking for him in connection with an assault. Leslie thought he was joking at first. He didn't bother even telling anyone; he couldn't see the need. Whatever it is, he told himself, it's nonsense. So it's bound to blow over.</p> <p>\"Half of me was going to dig my heels in and not even come in for questioning at all. Not after the way I was treated by the police the last time, with all the leaks to the press. But then I think, OK, let's just play it straight, let the police do their job, la la la.\" </p> <p>When a detective called, he promised Leslie there would be no media circus this time. They could meet at an unmanned satellite police station, alone, in private - and so, on June 23, Leslie rang at 1pm, to say he was in London. At 6pm, when Leslie arrived at the station, the first thing he saw before he was arrested was the lens of a photographer from the Sun. </p> <p>\"At midnight I got a call from my dad. He'd fallen off his chair. My dad was literally shaking. They'd just held up the front page of the Sun on Sky News.\"</p> <p>And so, for the second time in his life, Leslie found himself reading tabloid accounts of a sex life he didn't recognise, with a woman he couldn't remember meeting. She had alleged that he'd picked her up at a party in 1995, redirected the taxi to his house, and raped her. Police showed him her photograph, but as far as Leslie could see she was a total stranger. Yet her claims were all over the front pages, calling him a rapist. \"If I sound bitter,\" he told reporters on the morning after his arrest, \"it's because I am.\" </p> <p>Five weeks later the charges were dropped, but he still hasn't worked out who the woman was. \"I don't remember even meeting her,\" he protests. \"I've no recollection of it, and she says things that are very odd and not me at all.\" There are plenty of men, I venture, who would fail to recognise women they'd slept with. He would be one of them, wouldn't he? \"Oh yes,\" he agrees, \"of course.\" Would there be a considerable number of women in that category?</p> <p>\"Well, not that many!\" he protests, in that way lads do when the last thing they want to sound is convincing. He laughs, almost blushes, gives a little shrug. \"Well - well, I know - but. Well, yes.\" </p> <p>I've never interviewed anyone about their sexual behaviour before. It feels a bit weird. We meet at the Edinburgh townhouse he is renovating - his latest project as a property developer - and as we pick our way through the mud and dust of a building site, I'm not surprised to see why so many women found Leslie attractive. Once a famous ladies' man of London's celebrity circles, at 43 his looks are now more silvery than boyish, and he's dressed in naff country-club smart casual - a rich man's Alan Partridge. Yet still, he seems to have an unmistakable sexual aura about him.</p> <p>At least, I think it's unmistakable. It's hard to tell if it's coming from him or from the cuttings file on his sex life I've got stored in my head. Leslie's private life is so widely publicised nowadays, you don't even need to read the tabloids to be acquainted with it: ex-girlfriends have been garrulously candid, videos of threesomes co-starring Abi Titmuss saturate the internet, and practically everyone I know seems to have a John Leslie bedroom tale to tell. It's hard not to think about sex when you meet him. </p> <p>And for many people, it's hard not to wonder if he's a rapist - which is why he wants to give this interview. \"I've got to walk on site, walk into bars, you know? Those headlines were just vile. Ugly and horrible.\" </p> <p>Last time Leslie's name was in the headlines, the mistake he thinks he made was to keep quiet. He was practically the only one who did - \"and this time, it's a different ball game\".</p> <p>In October 2002 Ulrika Jonsson published her autobiography, in which she alleged that an unnamed TV presenter had raped her. She has never identified her attacker, but speculation about his identity pitched the media into a frenzy, and Leslie's was one of four or five names in private circulation. When Matthew Wright blurted it out on live TV, the tabloids went wild. Photographs of him taking cocaine appeared in a Sunday paper, and more than 30 women came forward to accuse him of sexual assault. Columnists declared the former Blue Peter presenter a monster - a dangerous pervert who exploited his fame to lure women home and attack them. Following legal advice, Leslie said nothing, promptly got sacked by ITV's This Morning, and fled into hiding. </p> <p>After 10 months, of all the lurid accusations reported by a feverish press, only one - for minor sexual assault - ever came to trial. It was thrown out when the credibility of the prosecution witness collapsed. Leslie, the judge told him, could leave the court \"without a stain on your character\". </p> <p>But the judge clearly didn't know how television works, for by then Leslie was unemployable. He moved home to Edinburgh, became a property developer, made a lot of money, and was - until his arrest - leading a relatively normal life. He seldom goes to London these days, he jokes, \"because whenever I do I get arrested\".</p> <p>Traditionally, stories about socialites ruined by sexual disgrace featured women, but if Leslie's life were made into a novel it would be a peculiarly modern tale. It belongs to an age of celebrity when the law and the media have become so entwined, the story could not exist in the absence of one or the other. It can be read as a parable about the power of celebrity - or, alternatively, of its perils - for the plot hinges entirely on one question. Did fame protect Leslie from justice for years - or expose him to a terrible injustice? </p> <p>There's no debate in Leslie's mind. According to him, his recent accuser was trying to make money by selling her story. \"If I had to put money on it, judging from what I know, I think the Sun were in on it from the very start. They knew who she was, they knew her whole story, who her friend was, and nobody else had that story. I think she went to the Sun initially, and they told her to go to the police. The police asked me if anybody from a newspaper had approached me, or if anyone had tried to blackmail me. I think they knew it was wrong, they knew something was up. The whole thing just smelt, it was just not right.\"</p> <p>How the Sun knew about his meeting with the police is certainly suspicious. But as the loss of two parents struck Lady Bracknell as careless, some people will feel that two arrests for sexual assault may take some explaining. Leslie disagrees. The sheer volume of accusations, he says, only proves his innocence. </p> <p>\"If anybody can stand there and say I'm totally innocent,\" he argues, \"it's me. I've been cleared by a judge, by a high court, by the whole of Fleet Street, who'd have paid any amount of money to get me.\" But all the women's allegations, I start to say, were disturbingly similar... </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he interrupts exasperatedly, \"because they all read each other's reports! They were all exactly the same. Come on, hello? Think about it. Not one girl said anything at the time. I was on TV, I was a public face. Yet not one girl had ever said anything bad against me. And then all of a sudden you've got a queue of 30. You're telling me not one of them would have said something at the time? Come on. </p> <p>\"Look, I was a single guy with a lot of girlfriends. I put my hands up to that. But there's a canyon of a difference between assault and seeing girls. At no point ever did I put a woman in a situation that was not comfortable. Nothing happened. It beggars belief. All those girls had the same complaint but not one of them said anything at the time? You're telling me I had 30 odd girls I did that to, and not one of them said anything. But then when there's money, and there's safety in numbers... It's pretty simple, work it out.\"</p> <p>It's interesting that Leslie's defence doesn't lead him, unlike many men acquitted of date rape, to demand the same anonymity enjoyed by victims - or for women to be stripped of that right. The accusation of rape, he says solemnly, is a courageous act which should never be deterred. If you were being cynical, you might suspect this was a piece of spin to make him look good. It certainly helps deflect any whiff of misogyny. But I'm inclined to take him at his word, because if there's one thing we know for sure about Leslie, it's how fantastically reckless he's been about protecting his image. As he puts it: \"I didn't protect the brand. Moi. I was stupid.\"</p> <p>As a child growing up in Edinburgh, Leslie was pretty square. A lanky, bullied teenager at music school, he was 16 before he ever had a girlfriend. But at college he took up DJing, became intoxicated by his sudden desirability, and dropped out to present a TV music show. When he moved to London to join Blue Peter, however, he insists he was still \"very, very straight\". What does he mean?</p> <p>\"Well, no wild parties. I had a beautiful girlfriend [Catherine Zeta-Jones, whom he dated for 18 months], went to nice parties and good restaurants, went to the right places and had a lovely time. There was no deviant - there were no crazy places to go to. I'm only comparing how it was then with how it ended up.\" </p> <p>It was two or three years later, after he'd moved on to present This Morning, that his legendary social life took off. \"You know, the bachelor parties when the doors were open, open bar, total strangers there. I was the life and soul of the party. I had a house, I had money, and I didn't view that as a crime, to have parties and be the boy off the telly and be in the bar and girls would chat to you. That's the reason I got into television, because I was open, because of the way I was as a person, I trusted people, no airs and graces. That was my strength, that was why I was there.\"</p> <p>By 2000, his brother, a radio DJ in Edinburgh, was warning him about the crowd he was attracting. \"But I was just, you know, I kept saying, I know what I'm up to.\" Leslie grins ruefully. \"Somebody once said, the wrong girls went for you - but you went for the wrong girls. Which I think is a great thing to say. That's probably what happened.\" </p> <p>The weekend after he was named as Jonsson's alleged rapist, a woman he'd invited home sold footage she'd secretly filmed of him taking cocaine in his laundry room. Just over a year later, another party guest stole the memory card from his camera, and sold the infamous photographs of Leslie, Titmuss and guests engaged in the sort of sex you would ordinarily need to purchase online to view. Leslie says the cocaine photographs were a setup - \"a pretty nasty entrapment\" - and points out that the man who sold the private pornographic pictures is now serving 18 years for serial rape. \"He's the bad guy all along,\" he says indignantly. Does Leslie think he did anything bad himself? \"Yeah, of course. I didn't protect the brand. I shouldn't have had those parties, I should have gone to better places, I should have kept my social circle down, I shouldn't have let in anybody I didn't trust. I just shouldn't have let those kind of people into my house and into my life. If I'd been a bit more savvy, and protected the brand, I'd still be on television.\"</p> <p>Surely he must have realised what a risk he was taking, though, by using cocaine. \"But I wasn't - I mean, it was only ever in the privacy of my own home.\" But someone always has to know, I reason; you can't take drugs without someone else supplying them. \"Well, I hadn't thought of the consequences, no.\" He looks uneasy and irritated. \"Anyway, we should move on.\" But why did he take such a risk? \"You may not believe it,\" he says testily, \"but I hardly did [cocaine]. It was kind of, you know - it was there; 'take it or leave it' kind of thing.\" </p> <p>I'm not sure I do believe him. In my experience, wealthy hedonists who party hard very seldom \"take it or leave it\" - and as Leslie himself likes to point out, cocaine is a basic social assumption among the circles in which he used to move. He tells me he hasn't used it in four years. But in 2003 he told another newspaper he'd stopped using it - and that was more than four years ago.</p> <p>But Leslie wasn't prosecuted for illegal drug use; his downfall came from what women claimed he did to them. Would so many really lie, just for money? There is very probably a degree of crossover between the sort of women who \"queue up\", as he says, to go home with a TV presenter, and the sort who might later be tempted to sell a pack of lies about him to the papers. But Leslie admits that how he used to treat them probably didn't help.</p> <p>\"Obviously there's a lot of women who've not been happy with the way I was with them. I've never raised my hand to a woman, or assaulted a woman. But I might have disrespected women, or not been proper with women.\" I ask him what he means. </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" he mumbles, suddenly vague. \"But I did have to change my behaviour [after the allegations]. I'm just aware of everything all the time now, always thinking, could that be misconstrued as something else? Because obviously that's what happened before. I didn't actually physically do anything wrong. I'm not an abusive or aggressive person, I don't hit people, I've never been in a fight in my life. So I was dumbstruck. But ever since, I've been walking on eggshells.\"</p> <p>It's hard to tell exactly how Leslie now feels about that chapter of his life, before it all fell apart. Sometimes he is unapologetic - \"I loved throwing parties, that's just what I liked doing, I like people having a good time, I like to share\" - but then describes it as \"out of control\" and \"carnage\". When someone wakes up with a hangover and a strange blonde woman in the bathroom, I try, that's usually quite a confronting moment. Did it always feel like a good laugh to him - or a dark morning of the soul? </p> <p>\"Well, but my alternatives were to go home and not go out and sit at home.\" That sounds like a false choice. \"No,\" he protests, \"at that point I was on television and quite well known, so I couldn't go to normal places and hang out with normal people. Wherever I went I had this kind of, you know, attention. If you stay home and go to the library, it's a long, hard, lonely road.\" But lots of celebrities manage to enjoy a social life that doesn't involve carnage.</p> <p>\"Well, yeah, but they're married. If I'd got married and had kids, I would have had that normal lifestyle. That would have been it, definitely. If I'd been married and stuff, the person I'd have been on screen would have been, my married life, whatever, would have been true to me, but I would have been - um - it's hard to describe - everything just kind of happened, there was no deliberate plan. Just getting in the wrong circles...\" He trails off. \"I didn't like being a celebrity in the first place. I liked the job, I loved the job, but I didn't really like anything that came with it, I never bought into all that.\" </p> <p>I burst out laughing.</p> <p>\"OK, I didn't hate it. But I loved the job. I could have easily done the job without all that nonsense. Oh I loved all the things that it brought, you know the money, the places, the parties, blah blah.\" So what didn't he like, then?</p> <p>\"Well,\" he stumbles, casting around for an answer and giving up. \"No. I just loved the job, the job was what I did.\" And for a moment, he looks wistful and suddenly vulnerable. \"That's what I miss,\" he says quietly.</p> <p>I'm troubled by a feeling that I ought to feel more sorry for Leslie than I do. The logic of his defence is compelling. Chequebook journalism clearly corrupts justice; the women in his world were probably susceptible to temptation; it may be unedifying for a celebrity to seduce and discard them, but not illegal. If the police, the courts and the tabloids couldn't get a single charge to stick, what should that tell us?</p> <p>Yet Leslie lost everything. The darkest time of all, he says, came after his acquittal. \"That was the worst chapter, by miles. Before, at least you have something to live for, to fight for, but then afterwards the phone goes quiet and it's a massive vacuum. You're left with this hole of nothingness. You've just been picked up, your life's been turned upside down because of this massive accusation, and then it's chucked out and you're thrown on a heap, with a massive lawyers' bill to pay, you've had these horrible headlines to deal with. And for what? It is just crazy.\" His famous friends no longer called. \"Celebrity support was nonexistent. That was one of the disappointing things. I think it was because of death by association. Everyone is so scared, and you're aware of how fragile and fickle it is.\"</p> <p>Although still single, he says he very seldom goes out these days. \"I'm scared stiff.\" He has trouble trusting women, and recognises that the feeling may be mutual. Most people, he thinks, don't believe he's a rapist. \"But you don't want to be in an environment where you might come across a drunk group of lads who might believe every word they read in the Sun. You don't want to test that water.\"</p> <p>If, after all of that, Leslie comes across as oddly unsympathetic, perhaps it's not surprising. Most people would be bitter and self-justifying, and brittle. Under the circumstances, he's remarkably unscarred - and I'm surprised by how much fun he is to be around. Nowhere near as surprised, though, that after everything, he says what he wants more than anything is to be back on TV.</p> <p>\"I believe,\" he says, \"everything happens for a reason. When I left TV, I was like - get away from it all. But now I'm thinking, why the hell not? If somebody would consider me, I wouldn't chuck it away. So maybe this thing [the recent allegation] - maybe it happened to get me back in the public eye.\"</p> <p>He talks a lot about missing the \"buzz\" of being on TV. I wonder how painful it was for him to watch Abi Titmuss's celebrity career blossom from the ashes of his own. The couple split in 2004, and if her recently published diaries are telling the truth, his jealousy of her transformation from staff nurse to paparazzi sensation was largely to blame. After Zeta-Jones, she is the second girlfriend to eclipse Leslie's limelight, but he offers only a serene, if slightly tight, smile. \"I'm very proud of what Abi's done, I think she's done fantastically. A star is born. Everyone says she wouldn't be there unless because of you, but I think Abi would have got there anyway.\"</p> <p>He would like, he says, to present a show - maybe about music, sport or property. I can't help thinking, why? One possible clue to the answer is written on his Range Rover, which bears the personalised numberplate JLS. That's nice and discreet, I joke. \"Yeah,\" he agrees. \"I think so.\" It stands for John Leslie Stott. Stott is his family name; Leslie was only ever his stage name. \"Yeah, I'm killing off John Leslie. I'm done with being him.\" </p> <p>That is the one thing Leslie told me which I would say, with confidence, was categorically untrue.</p>",
  "<p>For obvious reasons, the Shergar Cup requires team spirit from all the riders involved. But there is a lot of prestige at stake in winning the Silver Saddle as the day's top jockey and last year Hayley Turner came close to taking the honours.</p> <p>At Ascot today, Turner returns as captain of the Great Britain side and she may well go one better than last year, when her final points tally was enough to beat everyone bar Hugh Bowman. <strong>Crimson Fern (1.10)</strong> is a cracking ride for her in the opening Dash.</p> <p>Hindered by racing away from the main action, Crimson Fern failed to land a blow in Group Three company at Goodwood last week.

A useful sprint handicapper on his day, he ran creditably on the 'wrong' side at Newcastle last time.</p> <p><strong>Newmarket 2.10</strong> Set an impossible task, <strong>Whenever</strong> made up a lot of ground to finish fifth behind Metaphoric at Ascot. He has less on his plate against this opposition.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 2.20</strong> Europe captain G\u00e9rald Moss\u00e9 has the plum ride here on hat-trick seeker <strong>Shifting Star</strong>, who has improved since finishing two places behind Spanish Bounty at Newmarket in May.</p> <p><strong>Redcar 2.25</strong> Playfellow won in the manner of a useful colt at Haydock, where <strong>Becausewecan</strong> finished third. Mark Johnston's colt has more realistic prospects in this nursery.</p> <p><strong>Haydock 2.35</strong> The Coral-Eclipse proved beyond <strong>Multidimensional</strong>, but Henry Cecil's five-year-old can dominate this Group Three opposition.

But <strong>King's Event</strong> also likes cut in the ground and he shaped well on his return to action behind the useful Buccellati at Ascot.</p> <p><strong>Newmarket 3.15</strong> Rainbow View could start a very short price after her six-lengths debut win, the form of which is difficult to assess. It might pay to oppose John Gosden's filly with <strong>The Legal Blonde</strong>, who took on some decent colts at Ascot and was beaten only narrowly.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 3.30</strong> Fifth behind Sanbuch at Glorious Goodwood after none too clear a run, <strong>Formax</strong> provides Hayley Turner with another good chance. Strategic Mount won this last year and could make another bold bid in the hands of Italian champion Mirco Demuro.</p> <p><strong>Newmarket 3.50</strong> Off the same mark as when successful in this race a year ago, Giganticus has a good chance of following up after his return to form when third behind Laa Rayb at Ascot. Not far back in seventh spot, however, <strong>Big Noise</strong> caught the eye in that race and he is so far unbeaten in two runs here on the July Course.</p> <p><strong>Ascot 4.05</strong> Kinsya has place prospects for Hayley Turner, while team-mate Frankie Dettori's best chance comes on Cape Hawk, but G\u00e9rald Moss\u00e9 can have the final say with <strong>Perfect Star</strong>.

  "<p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>New Labour has been in a mess for some time. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2005\">2005 election</a> was only narrowly won against very weak Tory opposition. Around 4.5 million supporters have stopped voting Labour since 1997. Party membership has more than halved and its funding is in crisis. The Tories are on course not just to win one term but possibly two.</p> <p>The cause is political. Blairism is the wrong response for these changed times. The crisis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a>, the housing slump and rocketing fuel prices demand active state intervention of the kind New Labour has explicitly rejected. While David Cameron examines how to control fat cat salaries, Blairism demands silence on such issues. This is why the debate should not be about a change of leader but a change of direction towards polices that bring people security, greater equality and a sense of wellbeing.</p> <p>While the country demands action like a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/energy.taxandspending\">windfall tax</a> on the energy companies to end fuel poverty and pay for every home to be insulated all that Blairism offers is out of date policies of flexible labour markets and public services commercialisation.</p> <p>We can win again and reassemble a coalition of the middles and working classes but it demands bold new policies which address the real insecurities and genuine aspirations of the British people. New Labour can't do that.<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>I think we can agree that Labour is currently in a hole but I'm unconvinced that your rejection of the New Labour approach \u2013 the belief that we must occupy both the centre and left of British politics \u2013 offers the best way to dig ourselves out of it.</p> <p>And while we don't need to rehearse the lessons of the 2005 election, let's be careful not to repeat Labour's mistake of the 1980s: the notion that when the voters swing to the right what they're really signalling is that they want the party to move to the left.</p> <p>I've long been surprised by the generosity that you show towards the intentions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> compared with the caricature of \"Blairism\" that you paint. Indicating as you do here (and have done elsewhere) that Cameron may be more progressive than New Labour implicitly suggests that the outcome of the next general election does not really matter and ignores the real achievements \u2013 in terms of investing in public services and tackling poverty \u2013 which have occurred over the last decade. In reality, there's little in the Conservatives' largely undefined policy agenda to suggest that any of the Tory leader's fine words and aspirations will ever come to more than that.</p> <p>By contrast, you mischaracterise New Labour's attitude towards the state. Given that a windfall tax on the privatised utilities was one of the party's pledges in 1997, I'm not sure why you feel that a windfall tax on the energy companies to end fuel poverty would necessarily be beyond the Blairite pale.<br>Where we may disagree, however, is that I believe that New Labour's emphasis on both investment and reform \u2013 not commercialisation, but giving greater control over public services to those who use them \u2013 still offers the best way to turn around our fortunes.<br>Best wishes, Robert</p> <p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>The problem is that Labour has become a party of the centre-right because of its social authoritarianism and commitment to free markets. I was struck by a comment from Lord Tebbit who said recently that \"there are some things that just shouldn't be privatised\".</p> <p>New Labour's electoral strategy was premised on the belief it could shift to the right and force the Tories to extreme and unelectable positions. It also believed that its supporters had no where else to go.</p> <p>David Cameron has called our bluff and leapfrogged into much of the centre-left terrain that should be ours. The issue is not whether the Tories will do more on social justice or not but why we don't.</p> <p>Labour voters have had enough. They are now either abstaining or voting for anyone but Labour. They aren't swinging to the right but looking for security in a hostile and anxious world. If Labour doesn't provide answers and feels like it is out of touch then it's no wonder they are giving the fresh faced David Cameron a go. It feels like time for a change because Labour is stuck in a Blairite rut.</p> <p>I agree that people want more control over public services but this should happen collectively so that they can help to improve their local school and hospital to become good enough. New Labour is too busy encouraging individuals that can to opt out.</p> <p>I look forward to your support for a windfall tax. I'm glad we agree on something. Would you also join me on action to stem inequality by increasing tax on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">super rich</a>?<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>I'm afraid that when you claim that David Cameron has \"leapfrogged into the centre-left terrain\" then the issue is very much whether the Tories will do more on social justice or not. General elections, after all, represent a choice not a referendum. The reality, as David Miliband pointed out last week, is that Cameron may claim to will the progressive ends which you and I both share, but his means \u2013 lower spending, charity and more deregulation \u2013 are very much those of a traditional Tory.</p> <p>Labour's challenge is to point to this paradox while ensuring that the debate does not become, as the right would have it, a choice between \"big government\" and the \"small state\".</p> <p>That's why it's so important that, as we shift power out of Whitehall, we place it in the hands of individual citizens not other institutions. This is not at all about encouraging people to opt out; rather, it is the best way to ensure that those who have the least power, usually the poorest, gain the most.</p> <p>But, as I think we both probably recognise, much of the public has currently tuned out from what Labour has to say. I'm not entirely convinced that the kind of gesture politics which a tax hike on the super rich would represent is necessarily the best way to regain their attention.<br>Best wishes, Robert</p> <p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>Of course we need to examine whether the Conservatives have changed. But it's Labour that needs to change.</p> <p>You dismiss increasing taxes on the rich as a gesture. But it could raise enough to meet the promise to end child poverty.</p> <p>There are other policies we could adopt: we could start building council houses, mandate a living wage, create a national well being index, provide fee school meals for all primary kids, stop taxing people earning under \u00a310,000, place a ban on advertising to children, introduce a fair voting system, drop ID cards, elect local health boards, introduce a graduate solidarity tax instead of fees and phase out our reliance on oil.</p> <p>The list goes on and on. It's not ideas we lack but the political will to make them happen because New Labour is locked into an old paradigm.</p> <p>Let's get to the heart of our differences. New Labour believes we can only adapt to globalisation and that the state should be reformed through a mixture of managerialsim, marketisation and individualisation.</p> <p>Compass believes that through democracy we can ensure that the needs of people and society come before profits and markets. It's about so much more than putting power \"in the hands of the individual citizen\"; it's about putting power into the hands of communities to achieve a transformation of lives and society. Remember, \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\".<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>I think we both know full well that increasing taxes will get us nowhere near the figure needed to end child poverty once many of the super rich have taken action to avoid paying them, as inevitably they will.</p> <p>Personally, I agree with a number of the policies you suggest. But I'm not sure that they quite live up to the claims you make for them, given the yawning chasm that you appear to believe exists between New Labour and <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a>.</p> <p>Actually, I don't believe that the heart of our differences is about attitudes to globalisation. New Labour believes in exploiting its opportunities and helping people adapt to its challenges \u2013 not, I would imagine, a proposition with which you'd find fault.</p> <p>However, I am concerned about your apparent hostility to putting power into the hands of individual citizens. Empowering institutions, as you appear keen to do, is a sure fire route to ensuring that the sharp-elbowed middle classes get their way at the expense of the disadvantaged.</p> <p>That's why <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\">Progress</a> has been suggesting policies like individual budgets for job seekers so they can get the right package of support to get them back into work; a credit for parents to spend on childcare, weighted to give more to those on low incomes; a fund for pupils who are falling behind or are from disadvantaged backgrounds to spend on extra one-to-one support; and putting prisons under a new duty to reduce reoffending rates with those that fail placed under locally accountable control. All in all a progressive agenda with which I'm sure you'd agree?<br>Best wishes, Robert</p> <p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>Increasing the top rate of tax to 50% for those earning over \u00a3100,000 would bring in \u00a38bn a year, enough to end child poverty. Some would try avoidance and should be pursued with the vigour the government pursues benefits claimants. The policies Compass propose offer a glimpse of what could happen when principle and power combine. We won't transform society overnight. Social democratic Sweden took decades to build. What matters is whether we are heading in the right direction and building support for further reform.</p> <p>Instead New Labour still tacks to the right with the business minister John Hutton celebrating the super-rich. There is no vision, no groups or activists who support what you want.</p> <p>The story of the last 30 years is of socialised risk being transferred to individuals. Your policies would speed this up. Even the most empowered individuals can't withstand the forces of global capital and free markets. That's why people feel so insecure and anxious. That is why inequality is growing and social mobility drying up. And it's why people are giving up on politics \u2013 because nothing important changes in a world where markets and money rule.</p> <p>After initial public enthusiasm and ruling unchallenged for 11 years New Labour has lost its way. Some good things have been done; but it's been a major disappointment. You might want more of it but the party and the country don't. Change is coming; it will either be by us or to David Cameron.<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>Perhaps I was not clear enough: I was objecting less to the policies you were advocating and more to the fact that you claim they are so radically different \u2013 and, I detect, morally superior \u2013 to those advocated by New Labour. If you really want to launch an assault on free markets and global capital, by all means do so. But please don't suggest that free school meals for primary school children \u2013 a perfectly defensible policy \u2013 will achieve it.</p> <p>It's always dangerous to presume some superior knowledge about the intentions of the voters. Whatever the faults of the electoral system \u2013 and like you, I support making it fairer by introducing proportional representation \u2013 on three successive occasions, the country has put New Labour into government. And I think we're both fully aware that, contrary to your claims, there are plenty of party activists who want Labour to remain rooted in the centre ground of British politics. I don't quite understand, therefore, why you believe the direction you would like Labour to go in has more legitimacy than that which I am advocating.</p> <p>More importantly, I am curious about why you believe the policies I mentioned in my last email \u2013 encouraging greater rehabilitation of prisoners; focusing state funding on the most disadvantaged children; giving people on benefit greater support to find Work; and helping hard-pressed parents with higher support for childcare \u2013 is likely to speed up social inequality? I too am concerned with the social mobility plateau, a problem which Progress has repeatedly raised in our magazine and publications, but do not believe that we best tackle inequality by railing against the market or profit, which, let's face it, is responsible for our economic growth and therefore our ability to spend on public services.</p> <p>If you weren't so busy erecting a New Labour straw man to knock down, I suspect you'd find we agree on rather more than you think.<br>Best wishes Robert</p>",
  "<p>Ben Whitford's attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/immigrationpolicy.usa\">the American Immigration Control Foundation's advertising campaign</a>, dealing with population growth, is a masterpiece of illogic and error.</p> <p>We point out that population growth puts stress on the environment and that immigration now accounts for 83% of US population growth. Whitford replies, citing crackpot Julian Simon, that \"immigration-fuelled population increases will make little or no longterm difference to the US environment.\" Simon is the man who claimed that our planet could sustain slow population growth for the next seven million years. Mathematician Albert Bartlett did the math and found that slow growth (1% per year) for just 17,000 years would yield more people than atoms in the entire universe. Overcrowding anyone?</p> <p>Later, Whitford switches direction and concedes that \"environmentalists can't ignore population growth\". Then, substituting clich\u00e9-think for analysis, he claims population is \"a global problem that demands global solutions.\" Not so. The globe is too big for anyone to handle, but breaking problems down to the national level allows effective decision-making and accountability. Countries that overpopulate will keep on doing so if they think they can keep sending their excess people elsewhere. They will have no incentive to change their ways until the receiving countries close this avenue.<br> Whitford's final ploy is to suggest that immigration will reduce birth rates, ie, people will have fewer children when they move to richer countries. The facts, however, suggest otherwise. As noted by the Public Policy Institute in California, the fertility rate of Mexican immigrants in the US does not go down, and in subsequent generations it increases. Short on logic and fact, Whitford is long on ad hominem. He cites neo-Nazis who believe that immigration is a population problem and implies all who share this view are neo-Nazis. Yes, and from this insight we also may deduce that if neo-Nazis eat breakfast, then all who eat breakfast are neo-Nazis too.</p>",
  "<p>Good evening, everybody. For those of you who aren't overwhelmed with <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/08/olympics_opening_ceremony_live.html\">Olympic excitement</a>, we've got another eviction from the Big Brother house tonight. Will it be Dale, whose fake smile on hearing his nomination was a sight to behold? Or will it be Stuart, who has spent the past month weeping about missing his daughter but refusing to walk out? It's yet another win-win for us, anyway. Although I have to say I'll miss their homoerotic bathroom chats.</p> <p>More importantly, this week I have been consumed by an all-encompassing hatred for Rex. Nicole may be a textbook pretty, privileged teenage girl, but she seems quite sweet, and he's been an absolute horror to her. I am fascinated and appalled by Rex's concept of working one's way up from the bottom, which he claims to have done in his career as a chef in his father's restaurant(s). I am also intrigued by the editing, which has removed all reference to Rex and Nicole's discussions about certain incidents that have been widely reported in what I believe is called the \"popular press\". Why would they do this? Why? WHY?</p> <p>Also, I've found myself watching Big Brother's Little Brother a few times this week, and I have learnt that both Dale and Stuart have been offered a gig with the Dreamboys, that Bex has found a new metier as ring girl at wrestling matches in working men's clubs, and that Big Pictures' Darryn Lyons (or \"that paparazzi bloke with the stupid pink hair\") is Team Luke and Bex.</p> <p><strong>9pm</strong>: Here we go, gang. Davina's in a black jumpsuit, similar to Anneka Rice circa 1989. OOH! Davina mentions that Rex and Nicole are RIGHT THIS MINUTE arguing about newspaper stories, so I guess it's OK to <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/big_brother/article1444269.ece\">link</a>.</p> <p><strong>9.03pm</strong>: So what's happened in the house over the past 24 hours? Well, Rex and Nicole argued, and hugged, and made disgusting slurpy noises. And he put his hand down her top. They talk about bra sizes, and Rex asks why her breasts look smaller than a double-D cup. Nicole, quite rightly, asks him who the person with double-D breasts is that he's comparing her to. It degenerates into an argument about porn. I hope Nicole chucks him.</p> <p><strong>9.09pm</strong>: Nicole is in the diary room, weeping. I'd weep if I had a boyfriend that treated me the way he treats her. Rex is in the garden spreading his propaganda as he reinterprets history through Rex-tinted spectacles.</p> <p><strong>9.12pm:</strong> When prompted by Big Brother, Nicole confesses she's quite looking forward to getting her suitcase. Davina then mocks her. Well, that settles it. If Davina has taken against her, then I like her. And I'd like to see Davina last a week without her oodles of noir-shaded costumery.</p> <p><strong>9.16pm</strong>: On balance, I think Dale is getting booed more than Stuart when Davina reads out their numbers. I will laugh and laugh at Stu's face when he realises he's stuck in for another week and will have to bite the bullet and just quit if he genuinely wants to see his daughter. <strong>9.18pm</strong>: Rachel's in the diary room doing the shopping list, and has decided to cough up sixty quid for the suitcases in an attempt to stop all the arguments. Rex is apologising to Nicole but evidently doesn't mean it, which she calls him on. Darnell is talking to Sara about unwanted erections, saying that it happens when they cuddle. She screeches, \"Has that happened? Roooooooooilly?\" He says that he is sometimes scared to cuddle her too much because he doesn't want to stab her in the stomach. EW. <strong>9.21pm:</strong> Stuart's in jail for talking about nominations. I'd suggest to Big Brother that if they didn't want housemates to talk about nominations, they shouldn't give them carte blanche to do so when it suits the televisual need. But then, the rules of this programme sailed off into the sunset about five years ago.</p> <p><strong>9.23pm:</strong> The housemates have \"motivational music\" to help them do their cleaning. Rex and Rachel are the two chosen heavenly housemates to help the ones in hell do the chores. Rex is taking Rachel to task about not ordering ketchup, which is apparently the \"only thing [he] cares about\". What a despicable little man. Dale is trying to get Sara and Darnell tell him that he's gorgeous, and he's succeeding. \"You would be in the top, loike, two per cent of good-looking gooooooiys,\" says Sara.</p> <p><strong>9.31pm</strong>: I wish Davina would stop leching over Stuart and Dale. It's most unbecoming. The crowd, incidentally, are chanting, \"GET REX OUT!\"</p> <p><strong>9.33pm</strong>: Nicole, Mo and Kat all get their suitcases back. One of this week's mystery special prizes is a goldfish, of all things, which Kat has claimed as her own. Rex is shouting at Nicole to \"get the envelopes! Bring them to me!\" Rather sweetly, one of the special prizes is Rachel's message from home, which she gave up last week so that the Hell housemates could have theirs. Rex has claimed all the envelopes he possibly could, and admits, \"I'm selfish.\" Dale swears at him a lot, but it makes no difference. Mikey tells him he's the most selfish person he's met in the house. Then there is a classic quote from Rex: \"Mikey, don't be rude. There's no need to be rude.\" I really wish someone other than Mikey would properly stand up to him; he's a manipulative bully.</p> <p><strong>9.38pm</strong>: Mo is waving a net around at the goldfish and upsetting Rachel because she seriously thinks he is going to catch them, cook them and eat them.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Rachel gets to see her message from home. Her mum randomly tells her about some woman who's had a very short haircut, and then hits her with the bombshell - her half-sister, who Rachel has never met wanted to track down, is back in touch, and she's right there in the familial living room!</p> <p><strong>9.42pm</strong>: Tess Daly and Vernon Kay are advertising Guitar Hero again. Obviously it's no DFS/Nickelback, but it's close. I'm going to get a beer.</p> <p><strong>9.47pm</strong>: Stuart's still in jail, and has been for the best part of nine hours. He, Darnell and Dale pity the control-freakery of Rex and Nicole's relationship.</p> <p><strong>9.49pm</strong>: Kat is wearing a dress made of what seems to be silver foil and spinning round in a circle. I don't know why. Mikey is in the diary room slagging of Rex. \"He's just out for himself...I think he doesn't treat his girlfriend Nicole properly, either...For the last eight weeks Rex has been banging on about his girlfriend constantly...but I think he treats his girlfriend like shit, he really does.\" Yay! Team Mikey! <strong>9.51pm</strong>: Nicole is trying to create a romantic mood with her monosyllabic boyfriend by telling him that she wants to wake up with him. Sara is bleaching her top lip and Darnell is mocking her. She tells him that he would be a bad boyfriend. Lisa tells him that he is desperate for attention on a huge scale. True fact, Lisa. But then the same would be true of anyone in the house. The women ask Darnell what would make him happy, and he says, \"A family. A wife and a child.\" Aww.</p> <p><strong>9.54pm</strong>: Nicole's in the diary room again. She says she's had a great day. This is because she's got her suitcase back. When she remembers that her boyfriend was horrible to her all morning, she is sad again. Then she bucks her ideas up and focuses on the importance of the suitcase. She does seem to be really quite attached to Rex, though, which concerns me. Maybe she'll grow out of it.</p> <p><strong>9.55pm</strong>: The eighth person to be evicted from the Big Brother house is <strong>Dale</strong>. He leaps up and pretends he's pleased. Let us just hope that he's not hoping for an acting career. Sara is shouting about him having the best time ever once he's out of the house. Stuart is trying to look tortured and Gothic.</p> <p>Well, that's it for this hour. Remember we haven't got to switch over now, as Jimmy Carr has gone, but I'm open to suggestions as to what we can watch for the next 35 minutes.</p> <p>Just reading through your comments. Hello, caitlinb! Glad to have you with us tonight. Has Jen really gone back to her husband? Where is amanda50? Thought she'd be here ready to rip Dale to shreds.</p> <p><strong>10.35pm:</strong> \"Nice face. Shame about the eviction,\" says the voiceover lady. Davina reads a tortured link in which includes the phrase \"love muscle\", so let's not go there.</p> <p><strong>10.37pm</strong>: Earlier tonight, Dale was evicted and faked happiness. \"You're going to meet Davina! How exciting!\" squawks Sara. The housemates all fret about which is Dale's best side, all the better for presenting to the camera.</p> <p><strong>10.38pm</strong>: Dale is out of the house, and met by boos, of course, but also some screaming. He's clutching a Polaroid picture, the significance of which I have missed at this point. He launches himself at Davina, and then bounds about on the stage before posing for photos.</p> <p><strong>10.43pm</strong>: Dale and Davina are in the studio and are all set for an in-depth intellectual chat. \"Like\"-counters on standby, please.</p> <p><strong>10.46pm</strong>: Five \"like\"s in the first sentence. Davina says he seemed like he was genuinely happy to be evicted. Oh no, he didn't! He also manages to shoehorn in a dig at Kat within the first minute. He suspects that the majority of the house nominated him because he wanted them to nominated him. Oh, Dale, you truly are a mastermind. Well done.</p> <p><strong>10.48pm</strong>: There's some footage of Darnell in the diary room talking about Dale being \"accessible to the public\", and honestly, Big Brother contestants' concerns about their public perception really upset me. I long for the halcyon says of series 1, y'know. Dale gets distressed about what a total tosser he was in his original VT. He doesn't know why he talked about \"nailing\" all those months ago. Davina tries to get him to say that he said it because he wanted to get in the Big Brother house. \"I can't believe I said the 'f' word!\" he moans. \"Fanny,\" elaborates Davina. Sigh.</p> <p><strong>10.52pm</strong>: I don't understand Dale's reasons for wanting to be nominated. He is not at his most articulate tonight. Can anyone assist? These interviews seriously get worse. The evictees are too over-excited to string a sentence together, then Davina interrupts, then they can't pick up the thread of their answer again, then Davina tries to interpret what it is they're trying to say, and all that happens is a big old ball of babbling confusion.</p> <p><strong>10.53pm</strong>: \"Do you want to nail Jen?\" asks Davina. \"I'd like to hug her,\" says Dale. How dull. They show him Jen's eviction interview where she confessed that she'd like to go out with him. He says that he's surprised that she said that, and then Davina tells him to call her. Clearly Streetmate has made her the authority on relationships.</p> <p><strong>10.55pm</strong>: Davina mentions Nicole, and the audience boo. Dale seems surprised that Davina thinks Darnell has a crush on Sara, and calls Lisa \"a lovely woman\", albeit one who'd think \"you've got a nice head\" is a chat-up line.</p> <p><strong>10.58pm:</strong> Montage of Dale's \"best bits\", a big whoop from the audience, and then they bring Jen in. There is much hugging. She looks gorgeous. Davina wants to get her hug in too, and there's simply too much excitement - everyone is flustered and gabbing, but interestingly Dale doesn't look all THAT bothered about talking to Jen. Davina has this little gem of information for us - the heaven/hell divide is coming down this weekend. Cut back to the house, and Rex and Nicole are arguing again.</p> <p>That's it for tonight. Thanks for your company, all. I'm back on liveblog duties on Monday for Dragons' Den, and the lovely Heidi is here next Friday for Eviction 9. Have a great weekend x</p>",
  "<p>On Wednesday, a new poll stated that <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2008/08/06/ppp_poll_mccain_retakes_florida_lead.html\">John McCain has regained a narrow lead over Barack Obama in Florida</a>, largely due, in the pollster's words, to \"your prototypical Hillary Clinton supporters\" <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_Florida_805.pdf\">crossing over to McCain</a> (pdf). </p> <p>It's more than strange. How can purported feminists even contemplate voting for McCain when his creepy, fighter-jock attitude toward women has left a trail throughout his public career? Let's look at just three dots of gender jokes over time and see if we can connect them.<br> First, there's the boffo <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0708/11823.html \">ape-rape joke</a>. \"Did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla, beaten senseless, raped repeatedly and left to die?\" McCain reportedly asked an audience during his 1986 Senate campaign, according to Arizona's Tucson Citizen. \"When she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak, her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask, 'Where is that marvelous ape?'\" <br> McCain's aides said last month that he doesn't recall telling the joke, but they don't deny that he did. Then there's <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2008/McCain_temper_boiled_over_in_92_0407.html\">the c-word</a>. In his book <a href=\"http://www.realmccainbook.com/\">The Real McCain</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/cliffschecter\">Cliff Schecter</a> writes that at a 1992 campaign stop, with reporters nearby, McCain was joined by his wife Cindy and two campaign aides. \"At one point, Cindy playfully twirled McCain's hair and said, 'You're getting a little thin up there.' McCain's face reddened, and he responded, 'At least I don't plaster on the makeup like a trollop, you cunt.' McCain's excuse was that it had been a long day. If elected president of the United States, McCain would have many long days.\" <br> Finally, there's the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4X6XqNeF1o&amp;feature=related\">Buffalo Chip moment at the Sturgis biker rally</a> earlier this week. We don't know what Cindy was thinking when her husband lost it over his male-pattern baldness, but on Monday, when McCain volunteered her for a \"beauty pageant\" before some 50,000 bikers at the annual South Dakota motorcycle rally, she played along, gamely waving and smiling. \"I was looking at the Sturgis schedule,\" said the senator, reading from notes, \"and noticed that you had a beauty pageant, so I encouraged Cindy to compete. I told her with a little luck, she could be the only woman to serve as both the first lady and Miss Buffalo Chip.\"<br> McCain hasn't spoken about it, but many in the press have claimed <em>for</em> him that he <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/cindy-mccain-as-miss-buffalo-chip/?scp=1&amp;sq=mccain%20%22buffalo%20chip%22&amp;st=cse\">probably had no idea the contest was topless</a> and occasionally bottomless (much less that, during the weeklong boozin', druggin' hogfest some of the girls occasionally get roughed up, all noted in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/page2/s/caple/020809.html\">this ESPN dispatch</a>, widely circulating days before McCain's visit). But presumably, McCain did realise that this was a <em>biker</em> rally - a good place to find someone you want to have a beer with.<br> So what if he knew, some liberals, like <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/08/miss_buffalo_chipgate\">sex columnist Dan Savage</a>, counter. \"We're not the party of idiotic, knee-jerk prudery, and we look ridiculous when we pretend that we are.\" <br> Try telling Hillary-strength feminists that objecting to these sorts of slurs is prudish, though. And when you combine them with McCain's stubborn resistance to women's rights - on equal pay, workplace discrimination, abortion, you name it - you should have a formula for female vote repellent. The man's even voted to \"amend the definition of those eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-Chip) to include the unborn - while voting against legislation to expand S-Chip's coverage to low-income children and pregnant women at least six times,\" as <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3799/mcsexist/\">In These Times recounts in its August cover story, \"McSexist\"</a>.<br> And, ladies, don't forget his promise: \"I've said as often as I can,\" he <a href=\"http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/more_on_mccain_and_alito.html\">reassured the National Review</a>, \"that I want to find clones of [justice Samuel] Alito and [chief justice John] Roberts\" to fill supreme court vacancies.<br> Ah, but those are issues, and all of us tend to selectively block out entire slabs of issues. You might, however, expect that this trio of degrading digs are exactly the sort of big, sexy, cartoon-bright news items that would bust through the gauze of voting records and get the full-monty media treatment of, say, Jesse Jackson saying he wanted to cut off Obama's \"nuts\", a Paris/Britney ad or even a day's worth of the Rev Jeremiah Wright. Not so much, though. Hillary die-hards flirting with McCain can plausibly say they haven't seen much beyond his myth. Corporate media can claim it isn't connecting the dots for them because the dots are too dirty for TV. The Buffalo Chip story, for instance, never made the networks. On cable \u2013 surprise - Fox barely touched it, other than a bit on Fox and Friends, according to a Media Matters search. Of course, MSNBC was all over it, showing the cleaner clips from a video of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQHJd_3J7g\">2007 Miss Buffalo Chip contest</a> that included booty-shaking, banana-fondling, pickle-licking and (this last even MSNBC host Keith Olbermann had to skip) simulated fellatio.<br> As for the ape rape joke, even a sanitised version seems too nasty for the New York Times or Washington Post. Meanwhile, the mainstream media is unwilling to quote McCain blurting a word as old-fashioned as trollop, and is even less likely to print \"cunt\" or even the neutralised version, the \"c-word\". To appreciate the effect of this kind of prudery - and how the press de-sexistises McCain - check out this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFCl3EUMHSc\">skit by the Public Service Administration</a>.</p> <p>As usual, it comes down to the media's and the public's reluctance to give up the image of McCain as a rogueish but honourable \"maverick\", a Peck's bad boy you want to tousle before you take away his slingshot and pet frog.<br> NBC's Andrea Mitchell has reasoned that McCain's nastiness is due to his handlers keeping the poor guy \"inside a bubble\". Hardball's Mike Barnacle and Politico's Roger Simon were <a href=\"http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/pundits_defend_john_mccain_aga.php\">quick to agree</a>.<br> When it comes to his rough public treatment of women, McCain and his apologists have the excuse at hand that he's an early-'60s, martini-and-mistress <a href=\"http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/\">Mad Men</a> kind of guy, an image not without its retro charm. One of the fascinations of the series is the way it allows us to see the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072500734.html\">open culture of sexism at work</a>. It doesn't happen like that anymore, so it's a little like a CGI effect, comparable to seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger sit up after a shotgun blast to the chest in Terminator. (And like the Mad Men lead, Don Draper, McCain is a war hero, a status that wipes clean all slates, including Draper stealing a dead soldier's name and McCain's cheating on his first wife with Cindy.)<br> Meanwhile, Obama, one of our most feminist presidential candidates ever, continues to be black. And that leads to the turnabout-is-fair-play question that's been asked a lot, but needs to be asked at least through November: What if Obama had offered Michelle up in a biker beauty contest, or had called her a cunt? Tabloid headlines of \"baby mama\" undoubtedly would be revived, and African-American family values would be roundly condemned as fundamentally risky for the White House. Of course, many Clinton supporters have given up the ghost and moved on to Obama. But those Hillary hold-outs, perhaps re-stoked by talk of putting her name into nomination at the Democratic convention, are bitterly clinging to Obama's slights against womanhood (\"You're likeable enough, Hillary\") while closing their eyes to McCain's sledgehammers. It's like sleeping with the enemy.</p>",
  "<p>Who do we as MPs answer to? It's a fundamental question, thrown into sharp relief by the responses to the whole issue of MPs' expenses. While the public expressed outrage and demanded reform, the mood in Westminster seemed to belong to a different dimension, a bubble that sealed off the public at large. The expenses issue is but one of many, even if perhaps the most striking. </p> <p>We need to remember as MPs why we are in parliament \u2013 we were sent there by our constituents and answer to them. They are our employers, and have the right not just to appoint, but also to sack.</p> <p>Yet the present oath we are required to take before we can take our seats and get on with the job for which we are elected reflects none of this. It is not an oath to the nation or a pledge to honest and open conduct. </p> <p>Nor is it an oath to uphold the law, to serve and protect democracy or to serve our constituents to the best of our ability regardless of their political persuasion, a pledge that I have personally made to my constituents in every election I have stood for. The present medieval-style oath is simply a personal pledge of allegiance to an individual and her successors, all of whom are unelected and unaccountable:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>The oath taken by individuals who join the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom\">Privy Council</a> is even more archaic and absurd.</p> <p>Contrast this with the sensible affirmation taken by local councillors when they assume office, by which they promise to uphold the law and abide by the local government code of conduct. The world seems not to have fallen in because they don't take an oath to the monarch. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/news/opinion-former-index/legal-and-constitutional/mps-refuse-oath-queen-$1235565.htm\">My motion</a> is not, therefore, about whether or not we should have a monarchy. Having said that, is it really justifiable that when MPs arrive in Westminster, having succeeded at the ballot box in an exercise in democracy, they are not allowed to take their seat until they have given an oath to an unelected person? </p> <p>And suppose they hold republican views? Are we saying that such individuals should not be allowed to sit in the house, even if they have a mandate from their electorate, or are we forcing them to take an oath which they obviously don't subscribe to, simply in order to pass \"go\"? The first option is intolerable and undemocratic, while the second invites people to lie as their first act in the house, thereby demeaning the whole concept of an oath.</p> <p>I don't pretend that this is the most significant issue of the day (although it does seem to have caught the attention of the media). I would of course rather the media reported in more detail the many good transport policies I am responsible for promoting for the Lib Dems. But given that it is now in the public domain, I hope the British public, whether they are pro- or anti-monarchy, will agree with me that it is time for the oath to be updated, and the disconnection between MPs and the constituents ended.</p>",

  "<p>For months, Moscow's successive provocations in Georgia have left observers suspecting that it was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/08/AR2008080800285.html\">provoking a war</a> in the Caucasus. It seems to have finally gotten what it wanted. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/world/europe/09georgia.html\">Kremlin's blatant aggression</a> puts at stake not only the future of the most progressive state in the former Soviet Union, but the broader cause of European security.</p> <p>In recent years, the Kremlin had escalated its interference in Georgia's territories of Abkhazia and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/georgia.russia3\">South Ossetia</a> - bombing Georgian territory twice last year, illegally extending Russian citizenship to residents there, and appointing Russian security officers to their self-declared governments. South Ossetia's government in particular is practically under Moscow's direct control, with little if any ability to act independently.</p> <p>But this flare-up is a direct consequence of Russia's deliberate and recent efforts to engage its small neighbor in military conflict. In April, Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a decree effectively beginning to treat Abkhazia and South Ossetia as parts of the Russian Federation. This land grab was a particularly galling move because Russia is in charge of both the peacekeeping operations in the conflict zones, and the negotiations over their political resolution. The mediator had now clearly become a direct party to the conflict.</p> <p>Moscow then sent paratroopers, heavy weapons and other troops into Abkhazia. Although these measures constituted military occupation of Georgian territory, Georgia failed to respond militarily. Instead, with European aspirations in mind, Georgian leaders listened to western calls for restraint, and put their faith in half-hearted western diplomatic initiatives.</p> <p>Having failed to provoke Georgia to a war in Abkhazia, the Kremlin then tried in South Ossetia. Its proxies, the Ossetian separatist forces, escalated their attacks on Georgian posts and villages, making a response inevitable. Predictably, Moscow <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,400321,00.html\">claimed</a> a right to intervene, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080808/ap_on_re_eu/georgia_south_ossetia\">pouring Russian tanks into the area and bombing Georgian territory</a> - including the country's capital. But why would Russia seek a war in the Caucasus, and why does it matter?</p> <p>Georgia's position astride the western access route to the Caspian sea's energy reserves and Central Asia give it geopolitical significance. Moreover, Georgia represents exactly what Moscow does not want to see on its borders: a country both independent and increasingly democratic. Moscow instead seeks submission, preferably by authoritarian rulers that it can manipulate.</p> <p>Yet the decisive factor was Georgia's efforts to gain Nato membership, a move in tune with the country's progress in consolidating democratic rule. Angela Merkel's statement that a country with unresolved conflicts can't enter Nato helped, too: it sent Russia a signal that it could prevent Georgia's Nato membership simply by stirring conflict.</p> <p>Moscow's military adventure has far-reaching implications. To leaders in Ukraine and the Baltic states, it sends signals that it seeks to re-establish control in the former Soviet space. Probably correctly, leaders there assume they are next in line. More deeply, Russia's land grab threatens to return parts of Europe to the politics of territorial control of previous generations, negating the promise of integration and cooperation that the EU represents.</p> <p>Russia's behaviour is incompatible with its aspirations to be a respected world power. Indeed, thoughtful people will find parallels between this and earlier incidents of Russian land seizures when it thought people were looking elsewhere. \u2013 the Baltic crisis of 1939, Finland, and post-second world war Iran come to mind. With most western leaders at the Olympics or on holiday, Moscow's efforts to establish a <em>fait accompli</em> in the Caucasus cannot be allowed to stand.</p> <p>So far, the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,399962,00.html\">West's reaction has been inadequate</a>. Rather than standing up for their own principles, western leaders think they can improve Russia's behaviour by appeasement, fearful of threatening relations with an undeniably powerful Russia. But by doing so, western leaders have unwittingly encouraged the most irresponsible elements in Moscow, whetting the hardliners' imperial appetites by not attaching any costs to their excesses. That in turn inexorably leads to a worsening of Russia's relations with the West.</p> <p>Paradoxically, standing up to Moscow is not only the right thing to do in this crisis, but the best way to improve relations with Russia in the long term. For only a Russia that abandons its imperial agenda and respects its neighbors, irrespective of size, can be a true partner for the west. </p> <p>It is now important for western leaders to realise that their silence so far has only encouraged <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/08/georgia.ossetia/\">Moscow's aggressive behaviour</a>, and that they must now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/georgia.russia2\">stand in solidarity with Georgia</a> \u2013 in deeds, not only in words. Whether they do so will determine the future not only of the Caucasus, but also for Europe's security.</p>",
  "<p>The ordeal began with a mysterious package delivered to a suburban mayor's doorstep and ended with him handcuffed in his underwear, his two pet Labradors \"killed for sport\" by masked police officers.</p> <p>In a terrifying case of identity theft, Berwyn Heights, Maryland, Mayor Cheye Calvo, his wife Trinity Tomsic, his mother-in-law Georgia Porter, and the couple's black Labradors, Chase and Payton, were the innocent victims of a multi-state scheme to smuggle millions of dollars of marijuana by shipping them to unsuspecting recipients.</p> <p>Calvo and his family have not been charged. The chief of the Berwyn Heights police department, which was not involved in the case, has criticised the conduct of the Prince George's county police and sheriff's officers, who conducted the raid. </p> <p>Federal authorities are investigating whether the family's civil rights were violated.</p> <p>\"Trinity was an innocent victim and random victim,\" Calvo said in a news conference outside his two-story, red-brick house in the middle-class Washington suburb of about 3,000 people. \"We were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us.\"</p> <p>On July 29, a Prince George's county detective posing as a deliveryman dropped off a 32-pound (14.5-kilogram) package of marijuana for Calvo, the 37-year-old part-time mayor of the Washington suburb. </p> <p>Police officials in Arizona had identified the package after a drug-sniffing dog took an interest in it. It was addressed to Tomsic.</p> <p>Calvo brought the package inside, thinking it might be a fixture for the couple's garden. He went to change his clothes, when a heavily-armed police team charged through the yard. Seeing the masked gun-toting officers, Porter, who was in the kitchen cooking artichokes, screamed. </p> <p>The police burst into the house and, apparently fearing an attack, shot the couple's Labradors. Police have said the dogs \"engaged\" the officers, although Calvo said Chase was shot as he was running away from the officers.</p> <p>Calvo, wearing only his socks and underwear, was handcuffed. Porter was also cuffed and forced to lie on the kitchen floor next to Payton's body. The pair were interrogated for two hours before officers, who had tracked the dogs' blood through the house, realised something was amiss.</p> <p>Tomsic, 33, arrived home during the raid, and initially thought the house had been robbed and police had responded aggressively.</p> <p>\"They were my kids,\" she said of the dogs.</p> <p>Prince George's county police chief Melvin High said on Wednesday that Calvo and his family were \"most likely ... innocent victims\". </p> <p>He has not exonerated them, and has defended the way the raid was conducted. He and other officials did not apologise for killing the dogs, saying the officers felt threatened.</p> <p>Police have since arrested two men, including a FedEx deliveryman. </p> <p>In the scheme, once the packages were delivered a conspirator would pick them up, the unsuspecting addressee unaware of the plot. The package delivered to Calvo's house was seized unopened.</p> <p>Berwyn Heights Police Chief Patrick Murphy said his department was never informed about the raid. The county police said the officers were allowed to burst into Calvo's house without knocking because they had a \"no-knock\" warrant. Calvo and his attorney say that is not true. </p> <p>Calvo and his neighbours, meanwhile, are mourning the dogs, which Calvo insisted were gentle creatures. He posited one was merely greeting officers at the door and hoping to lick them when he was shot, and said the dogs were killed \"for sport\".</p> <p>\"Our dogs were our children,\" Calvo said. \"They were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 11 2008.

  "<p>It has always been hard to work out who fired the first shot in any of the many conflicts that had broken out in the Caucasus. </p> <p>Ever since June 1992, when the tiny mountain enclave of South Ossetia won the first round of its bid to detach itself from Georgia, the two sides have been intermittently at war. </p> <p>But the flare-ups in the last decade have been skirmishes, and for a while it looked as though peace had broken out.</p> <p>The weapons used today \u2014 tanks, multiple rocket launchers and fighter aircraft \u2014 made the fighting qualitatively different. </p> <p>Observers had little doubt that the operation to take South Ossetia back under Georgian control bore the hallmarks of a planned military offensive.</p> <p>It was not the result of a ceasefire that had broken down the night before - it was more a fulfilment of the promise the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, had made to recapture lost national territory, and with it a measure of nationalist pride.</p> <p>The assault appears to be have carefully timed to coincide with the opening of the Olympics when the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was in Beijing. </p> <p>Tom de Waal, of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting and an expert on the region, said: \"Clearly there have been incidents on both sides, but this is obviously a planned Georgian operation, a contingency plan they have had for some time, to retake [the South Ossetian capital] Tskhinvali. </p> <p>\"Possibly the Georgians calculated that, with Putin in Beijing, they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months, because the Russians won't take this lying down.\"</p> <p>If Georgia calculated that Russia would be inhibited by Putin's presence at the Olympics, that soon backfired. </p> <p>Within hours, the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, chaired a session of the security council in the Kremlin, ordering units of the 58th Russian army to retake Tskhinvali. The Russian president's military credentials are so weak - he had no other choice.</p> <p>Many of the 75,000 inhabitants of Tskhinvali and its outlying villages are now Russian citizens, with passports and rights to settle in Russia. </p> <p>Northern Ossetia, with whom the southern separatists want to join, is formally part of the Russian Federation. While Georgians view South Ossetia as a part of its sovereign territory, there is a rival Ossetian claim. </p> <p>It predates the current authoritarian regime in the Kremlin, but still links the enclave to the mothership of the Russian Federation.</p> <p>Jonathan Eyal, the director of studies at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), warned that all-out war between Russian and Georgia would amount to \"the worst crisis in Europe since the end of communism\".</p> <p>He described Georgia's decision to shell Tskhinvali as a brazen effort to humiliate the Russians.</p> <p>\"It is clearly a calculated gamble by the Georgians,\" he said. </p> <p>\"If they manage to overrun South Ossetia, where there are probably only around 1,000 Russian troops at the moment, they will have humiliated Russia and would have created a triumph for themselves.</p> <p>\"They will also have propelled the west into a diplomatic involvement on the ground.\"</p> <p>Eyal claimed there was considerable sympathy among western powers over Georgia's difficult relationship with Russia.</p> <p>He said the country was suffering from a deliberate \"strategic fomentation\" of the separatist movement by the superpower.</p> <p>However, he warned that taking on Russia at a time when Medvedev was keen to establish his influence carried significant risk.</p> <p>Russia could not afford to stand quietly by while Georgia made such a public assault on its troops stationed in the region, he said.</p> <p>\"There is an element of trying to call the Russians' bluff by assuming that the Russians will not be able to afford all-out war in Georgia,\" he added. </p> <p>\"I personally don't buy that \u2026 Putin cannot afford to be seen to be humiliated in such a brazen, public way. It's inconceivable that the Russians will sit quietly by.</p> <p>\"The only possible outcome is that either a ceasefire is negotiated and a mediation effort begins, or it goes out into an all-out war.\"</p> <p>Eyal said he believed Georgia's move to strike South Ossetia would generate a mixed reaction from world powers.</p> <p>He described a feeling that the country was \"more sinned against than sinning\" but that there was also significant frustration over the actions of its president.</p> <p>\"If it goes into an all out war, the predicament for the west is acute and the crisis would be the worst crisis in Europe since the end of communism.</p> <p>\"It would be much worse than the Yugoslav wars, mainly because it has the old traditional element of an east-west confrontation.</p> <p>\"There is considerable sympathy for Georgia among western governments such as the US and London. It is clear that the Russians have fomented the separatist movement for a particular strategic purpose.</p> <p>\"There is also, however, an enormous amount of frustration with the reckless behaviour of the Georgian president at this moment.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 11 2008.

  "<p>Buckle your seatbelt. Make sure your nausea bag is at the ready. Because the slimiest accusation yet aimed at Barack Obama is on the verge of having its moment in the mainstream media.</p> <p>Within certain fringe elements of the anti-abortion right, it's been an article of faith for some time that Obama's support of abortion rights is so extreme that it encompasses infanticide. As in the deliberate murder of babies after they are born.</p> <p>Sorry to spoil the suspense, but it's not true. As an Illinois state senator, Obama opposed a bill that could have had the effect of outlawing abortion, thus violating <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=113\">Roe v Wade</a>, the landmark 1973 US supreme court decision that guarantees a woman's right to choose. More about that in a moment. But first, let's look at the swamp from which this thing emerged.</p> <p>I learned about Obama's alleged support for baby-killing a few weeks ago while perusing a local right-wing website called <a href=\"http://www.punditreview.com/2008/07/have-we-sunk-so-low-as-a-nation-that-a-self-identified-christian-could-vote-for-barack-obama/\">Pundit Review</a>. What I found, in turn, referenced <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=18647\">a 2006 blog post</a> for the ultraconservative website of Human Events, written by Amanda Carpenter, laying out the parameters of the accusation.</p> <p>According to Carpenter, the Illinois legislature in 2002 rejected a bill that \"would have protected babies that survived late-term abortions\", even though the wording was identical to a federal bill that passed overwhelmingly, and that was so non-controversial even <a href=\"http://www.naral.org/\">Naral Pro-Choice America</a>, the leading abortion-rights group, did not object to it. She added (accurately, unlike some of her other claims) that the Illinois bill came up for a vote twice, with Obama voting \"present\" the first time and \"no\" the second, and that he derailed the bill in committee in 2003.</p> <p>Tracing the accusation back further, I discovered that Obama's Republican opponent in his 2004 US senate race, Alan Keyes, had sought to use the issue against him, accusing Obama of supporting \"infanticide\". At what must have been a memorable news conference, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, Keyes actually said: \"Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has voted to behave in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved.\"</p> <p>Finally, I came across<a href=\"http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2004/08/index.html\"> a blog entry</a> written in August 2004 by Chicago Tribune reporter Eric Zorn, who clearly laid out the differences between the state and federal bills (scroll down to \"Apple/Orange Report\"). According to Zorn, the federal bill contained language that specified the law would do nothing to threaten a woman's right to obtain a legal abortion - language that was not included in the Illinois bill. (In other words, Amanda Carpenter's Human Events post was wrong.) Indeed, Obama said at the time that he would have voted in favour of the federal bill, but couldn't support the state bill because it appeared to be at odds with Roe v Wade.</p> <p>Please keep in mind, by the way, that all of this is much ado about nothing. Murder is a crime. The federal and state bills were purely symbolic. Infanticide remains a grave offence in Illinois, despite Obama's efforts to defeat one piece of politically charged legislation.</p> <p>Now, up to this moment in the presidential campaign, the infanticide charge has only occasionally appeared in mainstream circles. It received perhaps its most thorough airing on June 30, when <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0806/30/sitroom.02.html\">CNN's Carol Costello looked at the charges</a> and accurately reported Obama's concern that the Illinois bill was aimed at outlawing legal abortions (see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZCXcTwZPY\">video</a>). But in the talking-head segment that followed, the conservative pundit William Bennett asserted, falsely, that by 2003, when Obama worked to derail the state bill in committee, the language of the two bills was identical. (The Obama campaign has <a href=\"http://factcheck.barackobama.com/factcheck/2008/06/30/washington_times_wrong_on_obam.php\">called Bennett's statement \"inaccurate\"</a>.)</p> <p>Nevertheless, the story continues to build. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America has already <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808020004\">called out conservative radio and television host Sean Hannity</a> for letting right-wing activist Jerome Corsi (of <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Swift_Boat_Veterans_for_Truth#Racist_comments_by_Jerry_Corsi_of_SBVT\">Swift Boat</a> infamy), author of <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808040005\">The Obama Nation</a>, falsely claim on Fox News that Obama favoured infanticide if a botched abortion resulted in a live birth. \"Obama's on record as let's kill the baby if that's what the mother wants,\" Corsi said.</p> <p>On the other end of the media spectrum,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/us/politics/07catholics.html?ex=1375848000&amp;en=9d38a1d1963392d9&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\"> the New York Times referred to the accusation</a> in a story this week on Obama's troubles in appealing to anti-abortion Catholics. \"Republicans are gearing up campaigns to depict Mr Obama as a radical on the question of abortion, because as a state senator in Illinois he opposed a ban on the killing of foetuses born alive,\" wrote Times reporter John Broder near the end of his article.</p> <p>In the Huffington Post this week, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/04/the-next-smear-against-ob_n_116891.html\">Seth Colter Walls predicted</a> that infanticide would be \"the next smear against Obama\".</p> <p>Ugly and false as this is, there is a certain cold political logic to it. Conservatives who oppose abortion rights have never quite trusted Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, despite McCain's anti-abortion rhetoric. Nor should they. During the 2000 presidential campaign, McCain ran into trouble when he committed a gaffe - that is, he <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/66/73/32773.html\">spoke the truth by mistake</a> - in suggesting his then-15-year-old daughter would be allowed to <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/26/mccain.abortion/index.html\">make up her own mind</a> should she find herself with an unwanted pregnancy.</p> <p>With Republicans fearing that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/26/politics/main4211650.shtml\">evangelical voters will stay home</a> this fall, accusing Obama of being soft on baby-killing could have the effect of helping McCain by depicting him as the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>But there's something else going on here, and it speaks volumes about our broken political culture. Apparently we are so divided that it seems perfectly reasonable to at least some voters that a major-party presidential candidate would support murdering newly born infants.</p> <p>Red and Blue America don't just misunderstand each other - we don't even recognise one another as having come from the same planet. All Obama can do is fight the lies and hope for the best.</p>",
  "<p>Gandhi once said that the best way of losing a cause is to abuse your opponent. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/06/conservatives\">In the case of Ian Oakley</a>, abusing your opponent meant subjecting his Lib Dem rivals to a truly horrifying ordeal over two years, which included slashing their car tyres, sending them pornography, writing poison pen letters and daubing graffiti on their home. Yet, sadly, his quite astonishing campaign of intimidation, harassment and criminal damage is far from being unique.</p> <p>At the last general election, Oona King <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4535885.stm\">said of her epic battle</a> with George Galloway MP that it was one of the dirtiest campaigns in modern political history, after she was subjected to many taunts including anti-semitic abuse. Following the election, King said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The thing that I am proudest of in this country is that we have a political system where political intimidation doesn't exist. That, actually, for the first time, came to the fore in Bethnal Green and Bow, and I think people around the country should be worried about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the long list of 75 offences admitted by Oakley, and, arguably, the most abhorrent, was that he sent letters to his political opponents accusing them of being child abusers. This followed the conviction last year of a Labour councillor, Miranda Girell, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/03/thecaseforafairfight\">was fined and barred</a> from office for three years for making similar accusations against her Liberal Democrat opponent. Girell was the first person to be found guilty of making false statement for political advantage under the 1983 Representation of the Peoples Act. Both the Oakley and Girell cases show that King was right to be concerned.<br> As someone who has stood in both national and local elections, I have some faint idea of what their rivals had to suffer. In the dirty world of politics, too often a candidate has to endure what Oakley described as \"robust campaigning\" and what I would describe as the politics of hate. Whenever I sent out campaign literature, a small proportion would come back covered in abusive graffiti \u2013 the perpetrator, of course, always remaining anonymous. Most of the comments were quite frankly puerile, but some were personally highly offensive and were directed not just at me, but also at my family. It never failed to amaze me that some people should stoop to such lengths, while never having the courage to say anything to my face.</p> <p>The likes of Oakley resort to these sort of tactics simply because they feel they cannot legitimately win the political debate. Targeting the local political office is one thing, but subjecting people to abuse at home must have been truly terrifying. However, in my experience, making malicious accusations anonymously is much more common in the workplace.<br> Many candidates have day jobs, which, like the rest of us, contain a fair amount of office politics. Often, employers are very uncomfortable when a candidate first comes forward and says that he or she has been selected to stand for a political party. If the person concerned is working in an environment where political neutrality is a requirement, the organisation usually has strict rules governing political activity. However, most organisations have no guidelines covering people wishing to stand for election. </p> <p>This leaves the candidate vulnerable if the employer takes an unsympathetic view of their activities and, more importantly, leaves them open to accusations from other employees or political rivals with an axe to grind. Standing for election can therefore be severely career-limiting, and this is one of the major reasons why so many candidates are reluctant to stand in the first place, particular in non-safe seats. It is also the reason why so many candidates are drawn from such a small range of professions, such as trade unions and political organizations, where political activity is allowed; or why others are in an income bracket where they can afford to forgo the day job.</p> <p>The new local government white paper \"<a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityempowerment/communitiesincontrol/\">Communities in control: real people, real power</a>\", from the Department of Communities and Local Government does seek to address this issue, but disappointingly, it concentrates solely on encouraging more people to stand as councilors. It says: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We want there to be better information available for employers so they know exactly what undertaking these roles entails for their staff, recognising the valuable transferable skills that an employee performing a civic role can take back into the workplace.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, the DCLG is consulting with local government and employer organizations, including the Confederation of British Industry and the Trade Union Congress, over producing an information pack for employers on civic roles, outlining the commitments but also the many benefits.</p> <p>The Oakley case shows not just the need to strengthen electoral law, but the pressing case for government to draw up national guidelines governing the rights and responsibilities of all those brave \u2013 or foolhardy \u2013 enough to stand for office.</p>",
  "<p>This week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/georgia.russia2\">Georgia made a bold gamble</a>: it moved forces into South Ossetia; a province of Georgia that broke free in the early 1990s, in an attempt to re-assert its authority over parts or all of it. The Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili ordered total mobilisation, and the Tbilisi government says Georgia has already occupied large parts of the provincial capital, Tskhinvali. If Saakashvili's gamble pays off, Georgia will not only have regained a part of its territory, but it will also have dramatically reduced Russia's influence in Georgia. The risks are commensurate with the potential gains: if things go wrong, Georgia could find itself in a full war with Russia.</p> <p>Saakashvili probably felt that he had no alternatives to the offensive. He came to power with two objectives: to re-unify Georgia, and to bring the country into Nato. But in recent months, he has seen both those goals slip away. Russia, angry at Tbilisi's attempts to join Nato, has stepped up its pressure on Georgia. In April, Moscow passed a law authorising direct contacts with South Ossetia (and Abhkazia, another breakaway province) \u2013 this made the Georgians worry that outright recognition or annexation will come next. In May, Russia sent troops to bolster the peacekeeping contingent it maintains in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And Russian planes entered Georgia several times, occasionally firing rockets at Georgian targets.</p> <p>Seen from Tbilisi, if Georgia did not act militarily, Russia would eventually make the re-integration of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/georgia.russia3\">South Ossetia</a> impossible. But Georgia is not blameless for current unrest. Georgian forces have bombarded the self-declared capital, Tskhinvali, on at least two occasions this summer. That is hardly an inducement for the South Ossetians to re-integrate with Georgia. </p> <p>However, Russian reaction to events in South Ossetia, and particularly its armed incursions, raised a new, more serious worry. With each uncontested Russian military move against Tbilisi, the sovereignty of Georgia itself was being eroded. It could never join Nato or the EU if Russian forces regularly entered the country. So a relatively limited conflict over two separatist territories was turning into a larger challenge to Georgia's independence, and to its right to choose a pro-western course. When Georgian forces moved on August 7, it was partly to reclaim South Ossetia but also to deny Russia the excuse for undermining Georgia's sovereignty. </p> <p>This all leaves the west in a quandary. Nato in particular will wonder if it inadvertently helped bring about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/georgia.russia4\">current crisis</a>.</p> <p>At the April summit in Bucharest, Nato denied Georgia a so-called membership action plan (a half-way step to membership). Germany and France led the \"no\" camp, on the grounds that a move towards membership for Georgia would alienate the incoming Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. But the message that Moscow took away from the summit is that pressure works, so it piled on more of it on Georgia. While it has discreetly supported Georgia's breakaway provinces for years (for example, by giving nearly all locals Russian passports), its most brazen moves \u2013 like the deployment of railways troops to Abhkazia \u2013 came only after the summit. </p> <p>The message that Tbilisi took away from the summit is that Europe will give in to Russian pressure. So it moved to not only re-take South Ossetia, but also to reduce Russia's ability to destabilise Georgia and thwart its bid for Nato membership. </p> <p>The west is left with precious few options. Neither the EU nor Nato wants to risk conflict with Russia so Georgia is unlikely to receive any military assistance from them. But both Tbilisi and Moscow will be sensitive to western reactions, so the EU and Nato should have some influence over the course of the events. They must strive to prevent Russia's full entry into what is, morally and legally, an internal Georgian affair. Russian troops are by all signs already involved; tanks are said to be entering South Ossetia and the Georgians say they shot down Russian aircraft. But it may not be too late to prevent an all-out Russian-Georgian war. </p> <p>The EU and Nato should make clear to Russia that unrest in South Ossetia is not an excuse for invading Georgia. One possible approach is to seize on Moscow's desire for a new collective security treaty for Europe, which president Dmitry Medvedev proposed in July. Europe should tell Moscow that if it wants the treaty to be taken seriously, Moscow must show that it, too, can be a responsible actor. And in case of South Ossetia, that means pulling back from the war.</p>",
  "<p><br>Written lore ... Staff notation in schools. Photograph: Getty</p> <p>In the news today, we are hearing that it is possible to get an A grade in GCSE music without being able to read sheet music. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/08/gcses.schools\">Damon Albarn has responded</a> to this, calling it \"disgraceful\". Well let's hear what you think - but first a bit of perspective.</p> <p>Historically the development of sheet music has been a liberating factor in the spread of music-making, albeit tempered by commercial interests. Just as the printing press assisted the spread of literacy, it also sped the growth of musical literacy. It liberated more complex and developed music traditions from the Church and in great part enabled the development of increasingly complex art music. By becoming a visual representation of music, composers were more easily able to challenge the limits of performers, by creating a permanent record to work from (which in turn spurred the development of better and new musical instruments).</p> <p>The introduction of mechanical reproduction of sound (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammophone\">gramophone</a> and its offspring) dramatically changed this landscape. Here we have a form of reproduction which favours the ear and not the eye. Negative commentators tend to disparage this development as causing listeners to become passive consumers; yet the development of musical forms (jazz and most popular music) which rely in part on an aural tradition of listening to and copying recordings in order to learn music, refute this.</p> <p>Of course, I learned <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(music)\">staff notation</a> as a young child. I learned not through school but, as do many privileged middle class children, through private piano lessons. I would hate to understate the joy that this has brought and continues to bring me; I still play the piano and cello, and the ability to read music makes me more versatile, if nothing else. And it also enabled me to become a music teacher. However, I also cannot overstate the importance of looking beyond the ability to read music to identify musical ability.</p> <p>As I became a lanky-haired teenager, alongside the grades and county orchestras I taught myself the bass guitar and formed noisy indie bands with friends. Crucially, these friends had no musical background, other than that they loved listening. Eighteen years later, many of these friends still get as much joy from participation in music as I do. Yet at school, they were exiled (admittedly partly by choice) from involvement in \"school music\". I think that this separation of school music from the real world of music is a terrible shame.</p> <p>It is the students who show evidence of great musicality - but have not had the privilege of instrumental lessons - that we need to address. The older tradition of \"musical appreciation\" where students would analyse scores from the classical canon in their music lessons (and little else) has been abandoned, thankfully in my opinion. Music at school should encourage participation. Performance and composition have been restored to primary importance. The recognition that one can be a fantastic performer or composer without being able to read music has encouraged exam boards to create a syllabus where it is possible for an amazing jazz drummer to take GCSE music. Is this wrong?</p> <p>I should also point out that musical analysis still forms a fairly large part of GCSE syllabuses (although this is not confined to classical music) and that the ability to read music will make it much, much easier to attain an A grade. Hence we do teach musical notation from Year 7.</p> <p>Finally, pop musicians often have an inferiority complex. This is compounded when said musician has a classical background. They are forever trying to justify their pop career, or worse, demeaning it to ensure people know that it is just a bit of fluff and that they used to \"write for small orchestras [at] 15\" (thanks Damon - we'd love to hear it). In retrospect, they regret the fact that they strayed from the \"pure\" classical tradition.</p> <p>It is evident to me as a music teacher that the practical aspects of making music, performance and composition, should be favoured at school. But what do you think? Should someone who can compose and perform incredibly complex music on the guitar, but who struggles to write it down as notation, be barred from gaining an A grade?</p>",
  "<p>Police and demonstrators expect clashes tomorrow as 1,400 officers from 26 forces try to prevent up to 2,000 climate change activists from closing down the Kingsnorth coal power station, run by energy company E.ON in Kent. </p> <p>Today neither group would say how they were planning to outwit the other. A spokeswoman for Kent police said: \"We are expecting the unexpected. Our preparations are constantly changing.\" </p> <p>The campaigners have spent the last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">encamped near the power station</a> preparing for the direct action protest against plans for a new coal power station at Kingsnorth. </p> <p>They intend to approach the power station by air, sea and land. One group intends to head up the road directly to the main gate of the power station. Another will approach through the undergrowth in small groups. A third will be making an airborne approach by means that have as yet remained secret. And people on rafts and boats will be sailing up the estuary in an armada to lay aquatic siege.</p> <p>But the authorities yesterday tightened their squeeze on the protests by formally banning the flotilla. Medway Ports Authority, using bylaws, declared the water-borne protest illegal on safety grounds.</p> <p>The campaigners argue that because coal produces significantly more carbon dioxide than other means when generating electricity, the station at Kingsnorth coal must not be given the go-ahead. It would be the first new coal station in 30 years and herald a new generation of stations. Supporters of the plans say the UK faces a huge energy gap if coal stations are not allowed and that future <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carboncapturestorage\">carbon capture and storage</a> technology can bury up to 90% of emissions.</p> <p>Earlier today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/08/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">12 protesters stuck themselves with superglue</a> to the offices of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, (DBerr) the government department that has been backing coal expansion in Britain. </p> <p>Others, saying that the proposed new Kingsnorth power station will produce twice as many climate-harming emissions as the proposed third runway at Heathrow, demonstrated at the Royal Bank of Scotland. A third group went to Windsor where power company <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/environment/2008/08/kingsnorth_protester_diary_blo.html\">E.ON sponsors a Lego model of Kingsnorth</a> power station. Other protests have been held at Gatwick airport and at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/07/kingsnorthclimatecamp.biofuels\">biofuel depot at Thurrock</a>.</p> <p>The climate camp has been marked by angry accusations that the police have used aggressive stop and search powers to disrupt the camp and \"smear\" the protesters. Yesterday, MEP Caroline Lucas and MPs Norman Baker and Colin Challen wrote to the Kent police pleading with assistant chief constable Gary Beautridge, in charge of the police operation, to resolve \"an increasingly threatening confrontation\". </p> <p>\"Climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration. But if it is met by an arbitrary, destructive and aggressive police response, the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent, law abiding people, particularly the young\", said the politicians. </p> <p>On Thursday, police had stop and search powers extended to the whole of the Hoo peninsula, where Kingsnorth is sited. Kent police said the decision had been taken because officers continued to find people carrying potential weapons, a charge that was angrily denied by the camp.</p> <p> \"What we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience\" said Maria Romero, one of the camp press team. \"We're not blas\u00e9 about breaking the law, but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking.\"</p> <p>Tensions between police and protesters have been growing throughout the week, with activists angry with what they said were disproportionate searches causing queues of up to two hours to get on site. With helicopters flying low overhead, Paul McLeish, 41, a lawyer and legal observer at the camp, said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/05/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists1\">police had confiscated items</a> including kitchen equipment, children's chalk and crayons, blots for constructing toilets and piping for water on the camp. </p> <p>\"The searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26-foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away,\" said McLeish. \" It's a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they don't think it is safe to come here. It's a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly.\"</p> <p>Challen, Labour MP for Morley and Rothwell and chair of the cross-party climate change group, visited the site today. \"The climate change debate in the workshop was of a higher calibre than in the House of Commons\", he said. </p> <p>It also emerged that the campers intend to make Kingsnorth a permanent camp. \"From the moment the first concrete is poured [to build the proposed new power station] there will be a rolling blockade,\" said one protester following a large meeting of the camp. <br>Additional reporting by Alexandra Topping</p>",
  "<p>Human rights campaigners scaled up anti-China protests today with demonstrations around the world and an unauthorised broadcast from inside Beijing as the Olympic opening ceremony began. </p> <p>While a heavy police presence ensured the streets of the host city remained calm, Chinese authorities were unable to stop the pirate radio transmission by media group Reporters Without Borders in the capital.</p> <p>Using transmitters and a homemade antenna, the message, broadcast in Mandarin, English and French, urged the government to relax state control of the media and called for the release of imprisoned journalists. </p> <p>Meanwhile, large protests were held in cities including London, Hong Kong, Delhi and Kathmandu.</p> <p>In London, around 200 protesters converged on the Chinese Embassy in Portland Place, shouting anti-China slogans and waving \"Free Tibet\" placards.</p> <p>Demonstrators from Tibet, Zimbabwe, Sudan and Burma joined forces to protest against human rights violations and China's hosting of the Olympics. </p> <p>Beating drums and chanting, the group unfurled banners attacking China for supporting the Burmese regime while another flag read \"End murder, rape and torture in Zimbabwe\". </p> <p>In a small side-street away from the main protest, pro-China demonstrators in smart suits held a smaller, more muted gathering in support of the games, waving Chinese and British flags.</p> <p>In Delhi as many as 3,000 Tibetan monks and refugees shouting anti-Chinese slogans clashed with police as they braved heavy rains to protest next to India's parliament.</p> <p>Hundreds of protesters dressed in yellow and green \"Free Tibet\" T-shirts stamped on posters of the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. </p> <p>In Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, 3,000 Tibetan monks and exiles took to the streets, demanding an end to Beijing rule in their homeland.</p> <p>In the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, more than 1,300 Tibetans, including nuns and monks, shouted and wept as they marched on the Chinese consulate. </p> <p>Protesters chanted \"China out of Tibet\" and \"Stop cultural genocide\".

  "<p>Hundreds and possibly thousands of volunteer fighters from Russia were mobilising to enter the war in Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia republic tonight.</p> <p>Units of armed Cossacks from across the North Caucasus region that borders Georgia were poised to join the battle for the separatists' capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In North Ossetia, the region of Russia which shares cultural links and a border with South Ossetia, lists of men willing to cross the border and fight against Georgian forces were drawn up.

  "<p>The McCain campaign yesterday <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/us/politics/08mccain.html\">sent back $50,000</a> in contributions that were linked to the Jordanian business partner of Harry Sargeant, who had earned \"bundler\" status by helping to raise $500,000 for the Republican nominee.</p> <p>In addition to running successful oil and asphalt companies, Sargeant serves as finance chairman for the Florida Republican party - making this week's media scrutiny as much of a headache for him as it was for McCain. As Sargeant told the St Petersburg, Florida, newspaper today, his bundling for McCain involved reaching out to foreign-born allies:</p> <blockquote> I have Venezuelan-American partners. I have Nigerian-American partners. I reached out to my friends and said, 'Can you gather me up some checks?' </blockquote> <br> <p>Sargeant's Venezuela-based business may be on less sure footing, though...</p> <p>An oil refining company owned by Sargeant, called Trigeant, is currently suing the <a href=\"http://www.pdvsa.com/index.php?tpl=interface.en/design/home.tpl.html\">state-owned oil company</a> of Venezuela, PDVSA, for allegedly forcing it out of the asphalt market in Sargeant's home state of Florida. According to the Trigeant complaint:</p> <blockquote> PDVSA promised to provide Boscan [crude oil] to Trigeant at a fair market price in part through a long-term supply agreement executed in December 2002. However, at around the same time, there began a two-month political uprising, including a general strike of PDVSA's employees, in Venezuela. </blockquote> <br> <p>Soon after the strike, Trigeant alleges, PDVSA began dealing exclusively with its US subsidiaries, thus squeezing out other competitors. Sargeant's company claims the resulting economic hit forced the sale of a refinery it owned in Alabama and the loss of another Texas refinery to creditors.</p> <p>When you consider that McCain has deemed Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez - who tightened his control of PDVSA after the 2002 strike - a \"<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182437,00.html\">wacko</a>\" and a \"<a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/national/mccain-urges-bolton-approval/40260/\">two-bit dictator</a>\", Sargeant's Venezuela connection looks a bit jarring.</p> <p>But Trigeant is by no means the only major oil company dealing with Venezuela, which <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html\">landed at No 4</a> on the latest list of countries exporting petroleum to the US.</p> <p>And as the Public Campaign Action Fund has noted, McCain has <a href=\"http://www.campaignmoney.org/node/251303/print\">plenty of other ties</a> to oil companies that did business with the Chavez-controlled PDVSA. (Obama has eschewed oil PAC money but does take contributions from <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obamas_oil_spill.html\">oil company employees</a>.)</p> <p>Still, the Venezuela lawsuit signals that more risky tidbits about the McCain fundraiser could keep drip-dripping into the public eye. As Sargeant himself told <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702133.html?hpid=topnews\">the Washington Post</a> when asked about another Jordanian partner who is <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/more-on-mccain-fund-raisers/\">now suing him</a>, \"People always make allegations in lawsuits. It's purely a commercial dispute.\"</p>",
  "<p>Keeping track of Guy Pearce's career is like chasing the plot thread through Memento. His choices are skittish, free-floating, apparently unconnected to what went before - and while you suspect there must be a narrative there someplace, it's sometimes hard to pin it down. So Pearce starts out as a teen heart-throb in Neighbours and then shocks the fanbase by cropping up as a brittle drag queen in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Just when you think he's establishing himself as an A-list actor (courtesy of LA Confidential and Memento) he's off making duds like The Time Machine and The Count of Monte Cristo. </p> <p>I meet Pearce in a book-lined salon, tucked away behind the lobby of his London hotel. He explains that he's just finished work on Bedtime Stories, \"a big kooky Disney thing with Adam Sandler\". But in the middle of shooting he took time out to play a small role in The Road, an adaptation of the apocalyptic, grindingly despairing Cormac McCarthy novel. \"So I turned up in happy Disney mode and everyone was on this almighty fucking downer,\" he explains. \"And then I flew back feeling down and everyone else was up.\" It is a whiplashing, switchback existence. </p> <p>Except that it's not, he says, not really. The actor has a knack of confounding expectations. On screen, he can be a coiled and intense presence whereas in person he's more sunny, more open. Moreover, what I had pegged as a career of chaotic extremes, he regards as a serenely balanced existence. \"I'm a Libran,\" he laughs. \"It's all about balance for me.\"</p> <p>Guy Pearce was born in Cambridgeshire, to an English mother, but moved to Australia at the age of three. As a child, he says, he idealised England and viewed it through his mother's eyes. It was a lost paradise, an antidote to uncouth Australia. \"All that changed after Neighbours,\" he says ruefully. \"The way England reacted to Neighbours was such a surprise to me. I couldn't walk down the street without people screaming. So that allowed me to take England off its pedestal and see it for what it is.\" </p> <p>We talk about his latest role, impersonating Houdini in Gillian Armstrong's Death Defying Acts. He gives a heartfelt committed performance, but the film itself is a bit flat, a trifle uncertain. It plays fast and loose with history, relocating the great escapologist to Edinburgh where he has a relationship with a phoney spiritualist played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. </p> <p>\"It's an odd dilemma, this film,\" says Pearce. \"I suppose that Houdini might as well have been called Joe Smith, in that he's just used as the tool to help Gillian delve into what she wants to get into, which is love.\"</p> <p>This, initially posed problems. The actor is used to researching his subject back to front; striving for as much accuracy as he can. \"Funnily enough, I came into this film after playing Andy Warhol in Factory Girl, where I was really struggling to get everyone to keep the facts straight, throwing history books down in front of everyone. I started doing the same thing here, and Gillian took me aside and said, 'Hang on a second. Not the same movie. It's not a historical film. It's not a biopic. Put the books away.'\" He gives a smile that is almost a wince. \"So,\" he says, \"that was an interesting step for me.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, I've quietly filed Death Defying Acts as another wayward sidestep, another example of Pearce being the best thing in a middling movie. How did this happen? I keep coming back to his breakthrough role opposite Russell Crowe in 1996's LA Confidential. Back then both actors were relative unknowns, two talented fugitives from Australian soap, all set to take the world by storm. Since then the pair have steered very different courses. Crowe has gone on to become a tempestuous prince of Hollywood, the hell-raising, phone-hurling, Oscar-winning mainstay of the entertainment industry. Pearce's career has arguably been more interesting \u2013 but it has sometimes seemed more fragile too.</p> <p>\"People constantly ask me about Russell,\" he admits. \"They say, 'Ah, you must be so disappointed you haven't had Russell's career.' But that just shows the external perception of what they think every actor wants: that if you want to be an actor, you must want to be Tom Cruise. But I've always struggled with the idea of fame and recognition. Yes, I want a certain amount of attention. But I don't need a whole lot of money, and I don't need to be throwing phones at people and ending up in the press doing crazy things every week, because you know that brings attention to yourself - and if you don't want that kind of attention don't do it.\" He pauses to take a gulp of water and insists that he's not having a pop at Crowe, honest. \"Here's a guy who does big Hollywood films, but they're solid, credible films and he does good work in them.\"</p> <p>As for Pearce, his own situation is rather different. \"Well, if there's a good studio film they're going to offer it to Johnny Depp, they're not going to offer it to me,\" he says. \"And if it's a bad studio film that Johnny Depp is not going to do, they'll offer it to me and if it's bad I'm not going to want to do it anyway. So the problem sort of takes care of itself.\" He grins. \"Then there are the ones that ride the line, where you think, 'Ooh, is it good? Is it good? I think it is.' And you give it a go and it ends up being shit and you think, 'Bugger! I didn't think it was any good anyway. Bugger!'\" Fortunately, he seems more tickled than annoyed by this predicament. </p> <p>So where does that leave him? Pearce is 40 now, working regularly and maintaining his happy equilibrium. It is all about the work, for him, he says. He is uncomfortable in the limelight and insists he is happier acting on stage in Melbourne or \"making films that struggle to get into festivals\". He has no wish to be Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe or Adam Sandler. \"I don't want that experience and I've never wanted that experience. I mean, I suppose that I had it a little bit when I was in Neighbours, and even then I was part of a gang of 20 other people. It wasn't, 'Guy Pearce in \u2026 Neighbours.'\"</p> <p>There's that N-word again. Coming into the interview, I'd assumed he'd be keen to airbrush Neighbours from his CV. Instead he keeps mentioning it; reaching for it as an example; turning it to the light. Pearce spent four years on the soap from the mid-1980s, playing Mike Young \u2013 a young Melbourne buck who (in true soap style) was variously honest, straightforward, troubled, decent and demented. It was a role that stuck him at the forefront of 80s pop culture \u2013 an emblem of perky Australian youth alongside his fellow stars Kylie Minogue, Craig McLachlan and Jason Donovan. For all its inbuilt naffness, it must have been a pretty heady experience.</p> <p>Pearce hums and haws. It was to a certain degree, he says, but his natural anxiety got in the way of the enjoyment. He was embarrassed by the acclaim, and felt it was largely unmerited, because he didn't actually think the show was very good. So he kept himself to himself and agonised over his place in the world. </p> <p>In the past Pearce has said that the key to acting is to identify a character's vulnerability, his area of weakness. Andy Warhol thought he was ugly, he explains, and Houdini was terrified of going unnoticed. \"And I suppose that for me, it would be that I suffer from a lot of social anxiety. I was a really anxious kid; a real loner,\" he says \"And I still have trouble in some social situations. I'm very aware of space-taker-uppers - those people who are always demanding attention. They make me very uncomfortable. So maybe that's why I've arranged my life the way I have - why I've never moved to LA or wanted that endless barrage of attention.\" He smiles, shaking himself from this reverie and preparing to embark on the next step of his curious, rewarding, infuriating career. \"But I'm a lot better than I used to be,\" says Pearce. \"I'm able to enjoy things now.\"</p>",

  "<p>It reads like the plot of a Russ Meyer sexploitation film, with a plot twist so barking that even the makers of Footballers' Wives would probably have rejected it. </p> <p>But it turns out that the owner of the world's first commercially cloned dogs is a former cheerleader and beauty queen who scandalised Britain 30 years ago after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/usa\">kidnapping a Mormon missionary at gunpoint and manacling him to a bed for sex</a>.</p> <p>When Bernann McKinney hit the headlines earlier this week upon receiving five pitbull puppies from the South Korean laboratory that <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gdrPiVkhRcWxpCDJQYH8kIZlZiRAD92CCQ9G0\">cloned her beloved dead pet, Booger</a>, some cruelly noted that the dogs bore more than a passing resemblance to their owner. </p> <p>The Seoul-based laboratory, <a href=\"http://rnl.co.kr/eng/pr/pr_news_read.asp\">RNL Bio</a>, charged her $50,000 (\u00a325,000) for the clones - one-third of its standard rate - because she helped them with publicity. But I doubt it could have anticipated the media frenzy that ensued.</p> <p>The Mail was the first to connect McKinney to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1042506/A-cloned-dog-Mormon-mink-lined-handcuffs-tantalising-mystery.html\">the infamous kidnapping of Kirk Anderson, a Utah missionary, by a Joyce McKinney</a> back in 1977. </p> <p>The paper noted \"the face was familiar, albeit older and heavier.

So was the alleged American, ex-beauty queen background.\" Asked by the paper: \"Are you really Joyce McKinney?\", she snapped: \"Are you going to ask me about my dogs or not? Because that's all I'm prepared to talk to you about.\"</p> <p>However, the Guardian noted today that a check of public records in North Carolina confirmed that 'Bernann' is indeed the same woman who infamously said of her captive missonary: \"I loved him so much that I would have skied down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to.\"</p> <p>No salacious detail has been spared in the retelling of the case. From the mink-lined handcuffs used to restrain Anderson, to his silky pajamas and the comment of McKinney's counsel, in rejecting his rape allegation, that \"methinks the Mormon doth protest too much\". </p> <p>The Times website even pulls up <a href=\"http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1977-12-07-04-002&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1977-12-07-04\">an archive clipping of the paper's coverage of the court case</a> today.</p> <p>It's left to a pulp fiction blog to remind us of the seriousness of the charges McKinney faced before she jumped bail and fled the country with co-accused Keith May, with the pair disguised as mime artists. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.trashfiction.co.uk/mckinney.html\">Trash Fiction</a> blog notes: \"The charge of rape could not then brought when the victim was a man, and anyway there wasn't anyone in the country who gave a toss about the alleged victim of the alleged crime: the prevailing opinion then - as it would probably be now - was that he must have enjoyed it. </p> <p>\"Curious double-standards we sometimes display, no?\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7705884\">resignation of the Muslim-outreach coordinator</a> for the presidential campaign of senator Barack Obama, Chicago attorney <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1096027,CST-NWS-obmuslim07.article\">Mazen Asbahi</a>, powerfully reflects two of the biggest obstacles hindering the political integration and empowerment of Arab and Muslim Americans.</p> <p>This affair demonstrates the external pressures of unfair guilt by association, while at the same time suggesting the internal need for better judgment regarding political and religious actors within the community.</p> <p>Asbahi resigned on Monday, after just 10 days on the job, because in 2000 he served for a few weeks on the board of an Islamic investment fund <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/08/07/obama-advisor-schiff-hardin-associate-resigns-over-ties-to-imam/\">with Jamal Said</a>. Said has been allegedly linked to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/22/AR2007102200731_pf.html\">accused fundraisers for Hamas</a> whose recent trial did not result in any convictions, but who remain under a cloud of suspicion.</p> <p>This reflects an unreasonable and unfair climate of guilt by association. It is part of a familiar pattern that is one of the main forces hindering the political integration of these communities into American civic life.</p> <p>Asbahi himself is not accused of any misconduct. Rather the issue is his fairly distant association with Said, who himself is disparaged because of the alleged activities of his own associates.</p> <p>The problem is that almost anyone who has been engaged in Arab or Muslim political affairs can probably be somehow connected in some manner to someone else somewhere whose views, activities or associations can be called into question in the post-9/11 environment.</p> <p>Call it two or three degrees of separation.</p> <p>These distant, usually third-party connections are then magnified out of all proportion and used to unfairly impugn or misrepresent the views and character of the person under attack.</p> <p>Arab and Muslim Americans naturally come into contact with numerous Arabs and Muslims both here at home and overseas. They cannot be reasonably held responsible for views and actions of others of which they were not aware.</p> <p>Some hostile commentators have perfected the art of seeking out the most distant of such ties to unfairly tarnish the reputations of almost everyone from these communities who has found a political role or voice in our society, including numerous Bush administration officials.</p> <p>If these are the standards by which Arab and Muslim Americans are to be judged, then only individuals who have been resolutely distant from Middle East and even community-related political activity can survive such judgments. A valuable and significant group of Americans would thereby be frozen out of public life to the grave detriment of our country.</p> <p>The internal challenge suggested in this affair is that Arab and Muslim Americans have not been vigilant enough about holding political, religious and community figures to reasonable standards of responsible speech and conduct.</p> <p>Even raising this issue is often seen as too divisive, thereby stifling the conversation and impeding improvement. But solidarity can no longer trump responsibility.</p> <p>Well-known individuals have been revealed to have deceived the community about their political views and activities, and are nonetheless now being championed as \"political prisoners\". Some student groups, especially on the west coast, persist in hosting political and religious extremists as campus speakers. Expressions of religious intolerance too often pass without repudiation. Self-criticism and introspection are distinctly unwelcome in many quarters.</p> <p>While it is a commonplace of political life that solidarity generally flows from the centre to the extremes, and not the other way around, Arab and Muslim Americans are uniquely unable to afford this under current circumstances.</p> <p>It is true and irrelevant that toleration of in-group or foreign extremists can be readily identified among many other American ethnic groups, and, indeed, among many of the most virulent individual critics of the Arab and Muslim American communities.</p> <p>However, the more important reality is that anything that suggests, however inadvertently, sympathy for radicalism in the Islamic world is a uniquely fatal political poison in our country.</p> <p>While considerable progress has been made, more work is required in developing a consistent and clear consensus among Arab and Muslim Americans setting a reasonable standard of what they, as a community, will regard as responsible and constructive speech and activities.</p> <p>These need, of course, to be independent, principled judgments, and not simply bowing to external pressures or reproducing bigoted constructs.</p> <p>But the impulse to reflexively defend marginal figures, actual extremists or religious zealots must be resisted, even when spurred by an understandable sense of loyalty within a community that feels besieged. Raising this issue will itself be seen by some as a breech of solidarity, but recognising and correcting past mistakes is essential.</p> <p>At the same time, it is unreasonable and unfair to hold respectable Arab and Muslim Americans accountable for the alleged activities of people to whom they are remotely connected by two or three degrees of separation, thereby effectively closing the door to civic engagement on an entire and very significant group of American citizens.</p>",

  "<p>The shadow of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 looms large over the Beijing games. Reporters want free, unfettered access to the square; Chinese officials have said \"No way\". Instead, <a href=\"http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/China-puts-hurdles-on-media-access-to-Tiananmen-Square/344929/\">foreign journalists</a> will have to register 24 hours in advance if they want to take photos or interview people in the square, and they will be accompanied by an escort at all times. They have even been instructed on which entrance they must use when visiting Tiananmen: the east side.</p> <p>Many have accused the Chinese of trying to control international perceptions of Tiananmen Square \u2013 Beijing's \"<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/4624666a2201.html\">blackened heart</a>\", as one reporter describes it \u2013 and no doubt that is true. Disgracefully, the Communist party of China's official position on the 1989 massacre is that it wasn't a noteworthy event. Officials still refer to it as \"the incident\", a shocking label for the Chinese military's massacre of anywhere between 300 and 1,000 people on the hot, heady nights of June 3 and 4 1989.</p> <p>However, western reporters and human rights activists cannot pose as the defenders of the truth of Tiananmen Square. If the events of June 1989 are denied by the Chinese government, then they have been distorted \u2013 continually and wildly \u2013 by the western human rights lobby.</p> <p>Where Chinese officials have reduced the brave uprising in Beijing to a mere \"incident\", western observers have mythologised it as a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm\">peaceful student protest</a> in a central square that was cut down by gun-wielding soldiers. They have subtly, and unforgivably, written out of history the most numerous protesters of June 1989 and those who suffered the most: the workers in the suburbs of Beijing, miles from Tiananmen Square.</p> <p>The lasting impression given by western coverage of Tiananmen is that students and academics set up protest camps inside the square that were ruthlessly liquidated by the Chinese military. The most famous, enduring image of the massacre \u2013 the grainy footage of a student standing in front of <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/\">a row of tanks</a> \u2013 strengthens the idea that this was a simple tale of students v the CPC. Even the title given to the \"incident\" by observers in the west \u2013 the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2013 implies that the killings took place inside the square alone.</p> <p>This is such a partial and selective history of June 1989 that it can be described as a \"denial\" almost on a par with the Communist party of China's labelling of the massacre as an \"incident\". It is of course true that in May and June 1989 students and some professors held all-day and all-night protests in Tiananmen Square. But there were uprisings across Beijing, and in many other parts of China, as workers and ordinary citizens protested against the chaos and corruption unleashed by Deng Xiaoping's market reforms.</p> <p>The tanks were sent out largely to crush this workers' rebellion, which posed a far graver threat to the CPC than did the democracy-seeking students. In <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930901fabook5462/george-black-robin-munro/the-black-hands-of-beijing-lives-of-defiance-in-china-s-democracy-movement.html \">their book</a> Black Hands of Beijing: Lives of Defiance in China's Democracy Movement, human rights experts George Black and Robin Munro argue that \"what took place was the slaughter not of students but of ordinary workers and residents \u2013 precisely the target that the Chinese government had intended\". Black and Munro argue that the Chinese military set out to crush workers, who had \"much more to be angry about than the students\".</p> <p>Certainly the most vicious state violence occurred in the western suburbs of Beijing, not in Tiananmen Square. There, as the China expert <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/thetiananmensquarepeg\">Jonathan Fenby says</a>, there was a \"far bigger massacre of non-students\". Hundreds of workers were slaughtered in the streets. That is why some, including Fenby and some Chinese dissidents, refer to it as \"the Beijing massacre\" rather than the Tiananmen Square massacre.</p> <p>Jay Mathews, former Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post, accuses <a href=\"http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/98/5/tiananmen.asp\">western journalists</a> of spreading an inaccurate, irresponsible myth about a massacre taking place inside Tiananmen Square: \"Hundreds of people, most of them workers and passers-by, did die that night, but in a different place and under different circumstances.\"</p> <p>And nor were the events of June 4 \"peaceful\". Understandably, even admirably, some of the unarmed workers attacked their oppressors. In one suburb, two soldiers were hanged from a burnt-out bus. A photograph of this people's execution was published in Granta, but it has never appeared elsewhere in the British press \u2013 perhaps because it challenges the myth of a peaceful student protest inside Tiananmen Square.</p> <p>Mathews has called on western reporters and activists \"to be precise about where [the massacre] happened and who were its victims, or readers and viewers will never be able to understand what it meant\". True. To this day \u2013 as a result of the selective remembering of influential reporters and human rights activists \u2013 the true extent and historic momentum of the events of June 1989 are not appreciated in the west. A widespread and inspiring uprising by workers, residents and students has been reduced to a childlike story about students standing up to communists.</p> <p>Like the CPC, western observers have robbed the events of June 1989 of their agency. They have removed from the frame thousands of protesting workers, and instead spread a simple morality tale about how people just like them \u2013 educated students and professors \u2013 tried to win a bit of \"civil society\" in 1989. They have abused the memory of June 1989, turning it into a weapon to be used as part of their human rights agenda for China. In the process, they, too, have insulted the dead of 1989, and have done great harm to history.</p>",
  "<p>Around 500BC, in the world's seminal study on military strategy, Sun Tzu hit on a theory that continues to influence generals, businessmen and politicians to this day: direct confrontation is for losers.</p> <p>\"Those skilled in war subdue the enemy's army without battle ... They conquer by strategy,\" wrote the philosopher-general. \"The key to victory,\" he said, was \"to be so well prepared that direct warfare becomes unnecessary.\"</p> <p>The Art of War may date back 2,500 years and be written by a semi-mythical figure, but Sun's precepts look set to get a fresh test over the next two weeks, when China's Olympic strategists put into practice a similar mix of asymmetrical tactics and long-term planning to overcome a more powerful opponent.</p> <p>Once the Games start this weekend, the hosts are hoping to outmanouevre the United States in a bid to top the gold medal table for the first time in Olympic history. But for all the talk of a sporting contest between the world's only superpower and its fastest rising rival, analysts say there will be very few direct confrontations.</p> <p>\"It's war by other means, and the Chinese have been very bright,\" said Francesco Liello, a reporter with La Gazzetta Dello Sport, who has covered three previous Olympics. \"I have no doubt that China will get more gold medals than US, but they won't do it by going head-to-head with the US. They understand that they can't compete directly.\"</p> <p>China has invested billions of dollars to build up its Soviet-inspired system of 3,000 sport-training schools and bringing in foreign coaches. But resources have been carefully targeted. While the US gets the vast majority of its gold medals from two sports - athletics and swimming - China has built up its strength in lower-profile and often less-competitive events. Its likely goldmines are shooting, weightlifting, diving, table-tennis, rowing and badminton, where the hosts will expect to top the podium in at least half the events.</p> <p>Contests with the US will be few and far between - and mostly one-sided. The opening basketball game will match China with the US, but even with the recovery from injury of 2.26-metre tall superstar Yao Ming, the home team will have to pull off a miracle if they are to overcome the firepower of the NBA's finest.</p> <p>The closest competitions between the two nations may come in diving, rowing and gymnastics. However, even in these sports the home team will put its strongest competitors in events where the US is weakest.</p> <p>China's most likely medals on the track are in the women's long-distance events and the race-walks. The exception is the country's most famous athlete - 110m hurdler Liu Xiang, who will be defending an Olympic title that it was once thought no Asian could ever win. When Liu won in Athens, it prompted commentators to talk about a new era for China on the track, but outside the highly technical event of hurdling, there is little sign that the host will provide a serious rival to traditional US domination.</p> <p>Huge resources have been focussed on diving, which is now so completely dominated by China that it has a slim chance of winning all eight golds. As in table-tennis and badminton, there will be almost no competition from the US.<br>China, of course, is not the only nation to target \"soft medals\". Britain is often criticised because its tally is boosted by rowing, sailing and cycling.</p> <p>But the host team is the product of long-term state planning. Almost the entire team comes from sports school, where some will have started training at the age of six. The most prestigious is Shichahai in central Beijing. Despite an unremarkable appearance, this small campus is an Olympic medal factory. Although it does not quite churn out champions like sausages, this single school produced as many gold medal winners in Athens as Spain, Canada and Turkey.</p> <p>This year, a record eight of their alumni are expected to compete in sports ranging from gymnastics and table-tennis to taekwondo and volleyball. \"China's way of training athletes has its advantages. Ninety-five per cent of national champions emerge through this system,\" said the vice principal, Shi Fenghua.</p> <p>Students study for three hours every morning and train for three hours each afternoon. They are pushed hard and many drop out, but those that continue have a good chance of reaching the Olympics. Shi estimates that 30 out of the 3,000 students who have enrolled over the years have become champions in their fields. In Athens in 2004, four alumni - Luo Wei, Zhang Yining, Feng Kun and Teng Haibin - won golds.</p> <p>There are several gyms, each adorned with a huge national flag to remind the young sportsmen what they are here for and who is paying. Wander the corridors and you can hear the squeak of training shoes on gym floors, the yells of taekwondo kickers and the clicking of hundreds of ping-pong balls rolling around long rows of tables.</p> <p>The routine is tough, particularly for gymnastics where the training begins from the age of six. One young girl appeared close to tears as she was forced to do dozens of flips as punishment for failing to do a beam exercise to the satisfaction of her teacher.</p> <p>The school's greatest strength is table-tennis - the sport that China dominates more than any other. In Athens it won three of the four golds up for grabs, including Zhang Yining - a Shichahai old girl - in the singles and doubles. The coaches and their students - some of whom are so young that the table comes up to their armpits - expect at least the same this time.</p> <p>\"No athlete would say 'I get too many gold medals, I'm tired of winning medals',\" said Zeng Jiuxiang, one of the country's top coaches. \"If you are an athlete, you must always want to win the gold medal to prove your strength.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is as optimistic about the prospects for Olympic success. Mao Zhixiong, professor of sports psychology at Beijing Sports University, believes there are unrealistic expectations of success for the host team. \"This is a hype created by the media,\" he said. \"At Athens, it was a big surprise that China got more medals than Russia. We cannot surpass America in gold medals this time because we do not have the same economic power.\"</p> <p>There is also a debate on whether the Soviet-style system should be continued. Critics say it is expensive and out-of-step with the times. But a big medal haul in Beijing would strengthen those in favour of maintaining the status quo. \"There are academics who argue for reform. The reason it hasn't happened yet is the Olympics. If China does well, reform is likely to be delayed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tonight, at the <a href=\"http://www.thecitycircle.com/more.php?ann_id=143\">City Circle</a>, the Muslim Institute will launch a radical <a href=\"http://www.muslimparliament.org.uk/Documentation/Muslim%20Marriage%20Contract.pdf\">marriage contract (pdf)</a> it hopes will change the face of British Muslim family life.</p> <p>Currently, the Islamic marriage ceremony (nikkah), performed by an imam in the presence of two witnesses, is not recognised by British law and often involves little or no paperwork.</p> <p>If things go awry and the couple divorce, the woman \u2013 and it is almost always the woman \u2013 experiences great difficulty securing the financial rights guaranteed to her under sharia law. The terms and conditions of this new contract, signed at the nikkah, clarify both husband and wife's rights and obligations in all eventualities. For example, it ensures that the right to divorce (talaq-i-tafweed), is automatically delegated to the wife, something that is practised in most Muslim countries.</p> <p>The contract is not just about divorce, though. It seeks to establish healthy relationships by highlighting difficult scenarios the couple may encounter in the future. Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui of the Muslim Institute explains: \"By laying out the terms and conditions of the marriage it encourages both parties to establish consensus on issues such as where they will live.\"</p> <p>Many couples bring to a marriage a certain amount of cultural baggage. They can find they have vastly differing approaches to lifestyle, such as the division of housework and personal finances. The architect of the contract, Mufti Barkatulla, has spent the past 25 years presiding over thousands of divorce cases at the <a href=\"http://www.islamic-sharia.org/about-us/about-us.html\">Islamic Sharia Council</a>. \"Problems arise when couples don't know what to expect. The lack of respect for each other's personality and choices is shocking,\" he says. </p> <p>The contract is the culmination of a four-year consultation process to address the pervasive gender inequality in Muslim marriages across the UK \u2013 inequalities based not in theology, but in culture. </p> <p>A major fault line is the role of in-laws. Sharia law explicitly states that a wife has the right to a separate living space, yet some Muslim communities in the UK, such as those from the subcontinent, cherish a rigid cultural attitude that living with in-laws is an Islamic convention. Polygamy is another contentious issue the new contract clarifies, illegal under British law and subject to strict conditions set down in the Qur'an.</p> <p>The Qur'an has always been translated from Arabic, a language in which words can take on multiple meanings, in a process historically undertaken by male scholars. Islamic law declares a witness to a nikkah must be a sane, responsible adult. This has been culturally interpreted to mean men only. In the new contract women and non-Muslims may be witnesses. In addition, the consent of a wali or guardian of a female adult who wants to marry, becomes optional. Parents attempting to prevent their daughter marrying against their wishes can no longer use this rule.</p> <p>That the rights accorded by the contract are rooted in sharia law ignites the debate over whether aspects of sharia may be incorporated into UK law. However, if more mosques apply to become sites registered for the solemnisation of marriage, Muslim couples will be able to make their civil ceremony coincide with the nikkah, rendering part of that controversy redundant.<br> What better way to encourage social cohesion and tackle radicalisation than building families in a context of harmony and cooperation, where the rights of women are not only respected, but valued? Bringing up children in a positive, nurturing environment will do much to combat disaffection and alienation in future generations, and could help cut off the oxygen that fuels extremism. </p> <p>These are ambitious aims. However, the fact that the contract is endorsed by an unprecedented number of Muslim organisations and the launch hosted by a progressive group of second-generation Muslims, the City Circle, bodes well.</p> <p>Yet, it remains to be seen whether the Muslim marriage contract will make an impact on more traditional Muslim communities such as those in Bradford and Oldham, and whether it can challenge the widespread misunderstanding of gender roles in Islam.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Herts. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Charli XCX (synths, voice, drums, guitar, bass, piano and tambourine) and Darren Bazzoni (drums on some tracks). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> We're not sure how 4 Real this character is but if it's a joke it's a good one. Charli XCX is a 15-year-old from Hertfordshire who writes her own songs and sings them in a brazenly mockney-fied Home Counties accent while sat behind a keyboard \u2013 she's a pubescent MIA, the computer-pop Kate Nash, Lily Allen lost in space, the female Frankmusik, the Fisher Price Fischerspooner, Lykke Li's grimy young British cousin. Emmeline is what you imagine it might be like to get high on Smarties at a rave. Too Cool beats early Human League for sheer synth-simplicity \u2013 you can just see the red felt tip marks daubed on the notes she's meant to press - while I Wanna Be Darth Vader, with its low rumbling synth-bass and Atari squawks and bleeps, is like S Club Juniors meets Crystal Castles, or 8-bit electro for tweenies. And debut single \u00a1Franchesckaar!, complete with classic rave sirens, disses the popular girl at school with a snarl and a sneer worthy of Lele[SPEAKS] (see NBOTD No 361). <br> Sugababes kickstarted the trend this century for electro girl-pop with the Gary Numan-sampling Freak Like Me, although actually Charli XCX is more of a Spice Girls fan. She also likes Justice, 2ManyDJs and has been remixed by \"sizzlin'\" (it says here) duo Tapedeck (Klaxons/Kate Nash), so she's no fool. We know this because she has just taken 13 GCSEs, with results due on August 21, so, as she instructs, \"everything crossed!\" Then again, she also writes like she speaks, like the excitable spawn of Keith Prodigy and whatever hyperactive chavbeast Big Brother has thrown up this summer - her DNA, you imagine, is comprised mainly of E numbers: \"My music mixes elements from grime (brrrrap breh eeeekkekk safeee), indie, pop and some dance - waaaah!\" goes one of her blog entries. \"Check out some of my stuff on my MySpace (follow the link- woopwoop!). Hope you like it - rararaaa. I'm off now to pretend to be a cloud. Lalala.\"  What on earth is she on about? And, more importantly, who is the soon-to-be-notorious \u00a1Franchesckaar!? \"The stereotypical posh girl,\" she says, eyes rolling upwards in their sockets like Linda Blair in The Exorcist transported to Grange Hill. \"The girl who wears Jack Wills and Ugg boots wherever she goes. She follows fashion conformity with all her friends ... eek!\" Eek indeed. She'd be scary if she wasn't so talented. She's got a Grade 8 in singing, she first performed aged four on a cruise liner in a talent contest singing Aqua's Barbie Girl, and won. And she recorded her debut album, 14, last summer when she was 14, hence the 14 entirely self-penned and self-performed tracks. Her plan was to sell it to her school friends but she got picked up by a label and now she's going conventional, issuing her debut single proper via record label Orange Red Green Yellow, or ORGY. Cheeky girl. But, obviously, better than the Cheeky Girls.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Lock up your teenage sons, heeeeere's Charli!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> The words \"Lady\", \"Sovereign\" and \"Whatever happened to\" spring to mind, but it would be a shame if Ms XCX didn't have at least one novelty hit. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Scare boys. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Run off with Lembit Opik. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut single \u00a1Franchesckaar! is released by Orange Red Green Yellow on August 18. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> MIA, Lele[SPEAKS], Lady Sovereign, Frankmusik. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/charlixcx\">www.myspace.com/charlixcx</a><br> <strong>Monday's new band:</strong> Pavilion.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Get ready for the big show</strong></p> <p>At 8.03pm (1.03pm BST) precisely, a blitzkrieg of fireworks will be pumped into the Beijing night sky. First at Yongdingmen South, then Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, before rattling north along the Beijing meridian, creating \u2013 silver iodide shells permitting - either a fiery snake-like effect above the night sky or an even greater smog cloud. Five minutes later, the firework procession will end at the Bird's Nest stadium and the opening ceremony will begin.</p> <p>Providing an errant firework doesn't take out her larynx, Britain will be represented by Sarah Brightman, who will perform the games' theme song with Chinese popstar Liu Huan. By 9am this morning the crowds were swarming around the stadium, even though most didn't have tickets. There must have been almost 20,000 on the walkway last night, with whole families turning up to photograph themselves by the Bird's Nest. If anything there were even more this morning, many wearing red pro-China headbands. So far, however, there are no signs of the excessive nationalism of Berlin 1936 or, heaven forbid, Atlanta 1996. But these Games are still in their embryonic stage.</p> <p>The other big issue remains the quality of Beijing's air, which was down to 80 on the pollution scale today, from 96 yesterday (anything over 100 is pretty bad, while over 300 is prepare-your-will time). Organisers are also continuing to stress their 'Green Olympics concept'. Yesterday they even promised that tonight's fireworks will use \"less smoking powder to minimise smoke and dust pollution\" \u2013 which might just negate the coaches outside the stadium with their engines permanently turned on.</p> <p>Meanwhile the shadowboxing between China and the US has begun in earnest. The Americans have been downplaying their chances, with one official insisting: \"I know their resources and I know what they intend to do, and we clearly expect them to become the dominant Olympic team for years to come. We're not used to being underdog, but we'll get used to this and do our best\" \u2013 which is hardly the boisterous U-S-A! U-S-A! tone of Athens. Still, picking the Sudanese-born Lopez Lomong to carry their flag is an interesting attempt to get under China's skin. The reaction he gets from the crowd tonight may yet determine the tone between the two countries for the rest of the games.</p> <p><strong>Bei-watch</strong></p> <p>Tom Daley may be only 14 but he's already a sponsor's dream. During the GB diving press conference he scattered plugs like confetti. \"My family booked their trip last year through Sport-Travel\", he began, \"and thanks to Team Visa I managed to meet up with Steve Redgrave.\" Later he added: \"Our rooms have been very nicely kitted out by B&amp;Q.\" The kid is going to print a lot of marketers' meal tickets.</p> <p>But while he's pretty switched on in some areas, Daley still has some learning to do. He said how pleased he'd been when Jamie Murray had wandered over to talk to him at breakfast today, but looked a little puzzled at the throaty chuckle that went up when he added that he'd been sat with Tonia Couch, the rather attractive young blonde competing in the individual women's platform.</p> <p>Some elements of the media have been moaning about the smog and excessive bureaucracy in Beijing. But there have been no such criticisms of the media centre, which has a swanky gym, a hairdressers and free massages \u2013 and, between 10-11am and 4-5pm, free fruit, cake and drinks.</p> <p>Since antiquity the number six, representing smoothness, stability and luck, has been considered the luckiest in China. No more. Now it's eight \u2013 the symbol of prosperity and getting rich quick. Some put this switch down to Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, others to the birth of Princess Eugenie on 8/8/88. Either way the Chinese believe in this hooey: last year, 3,390 couples were married on August 8 in Beijing. Today, with three eights in the date it will be 16,400. And the Olympics will also be starting at 8.08pm too.</p> <p>China Daily, China's main English-language newspaper/Communist party mouthpiece (think Pravda with a state-of-the-art DTP system) has spent all week spinning like Alastair Campbell on a cycling turbo (sample headline \u2013 'IOC: Air Is Safe For One And All' on a day the smog above the city didn't clear all day.) You'd expect that. But a column claiming that China's policy in Africa, including Sudan, is based on 'reciprocity, mutual benefit and joint development' and 'totally different from the brutal and bloody ways the Western colonists plundered African resources' was surely pushing the party line a little too far?</p> <p>On this day of all days, we citizens of the world should focus on what unites us rather than divides us. <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/05/content_8961139.htm\">Congratulations to this guy, then,</a> who proves that \"claiming to see stuff in inanimate objects for the purpose of getting oneself featured in the news media\" is not merely the preserve of the degenerate west. Of course, this early-stage capitalist has yet to realise the eBayability of his ugly little rock - but once Mao's face has been spotted on a few more pieces of toast, this will swiftly change, as China's rampant faux-ly relic economy leaves the rest of the world trailing.</p> <p><strong>Coming up this weekend</strong></p> <p>SATURDAY</p> <p><strong>Shooting:</strong> The first gold medal will be awarded to the winner of the women's 10m air rifle at approximately 2.45am BST.

He'll be in action from 5am BST until, if he makes it all the way to the final, 12.03pm BST.</p> <p><strong>Swimming:</strong> Michael Phelps begins his quest for a record-breaking eight gold medals when he competes in the first event in the Water Cube, the heats of the 400m individual medley.<br><strong><br>Sailing and equestrianism: </strong>They may not be in Beijing, but we'll still be keeping a close eye on the sailors in Qingdao and the riders in Hong Kong, expected to be a valuable source of medals for Team GB.

  "<p>Pakistan has reached a watershed moment in its short history. For the first time in its six decades of existence, formal proceedings are in train to remove a sitting military head of state. In some respects, recent events reflect past experiences. The Pakistan supreme court has previously declared the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan\">Yahya Khan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=muhammad_zia_ul-haq\">Zia ul-Haq</a> dictatorships illegal. On both occasions, however, the decisions occurred after the two men had relinquished power. The current decision to <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKISL26399620080808\">impeach Musharraf</a>, should he fail a vote of confidence in the national assembly, is somewhat unprecedented. It is a shot in the arm for the rule of law in Pakistan.</p> <p>At the same time as impeachment has been mooted in Pakistan, another, largely ignored one is being considered in the United States. Last month former presidential nominee, Dennis Kucinich, brought proceedings to impeach George Bush for orchestrating the invasion of Iraq. The Senate judiciary committee hearing his <a href=\" http://kucinich.us/impeachment/articles.pdf\">petition (pdf)</a> did not allow Kucinich to use the 'I' word, however, and the hearing is symbolic at best.</p> <p>But there remains an underlying logic to impeachment. Richard Nixon was almost impeached for clandestinely seeking to undermine his Democratic opponents (he resigned before he could be chucked out) and Bill Clinton was impeached for failing to disclose his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky (the House of Representatives impeached him, but the Senate acquitted him, and he wasn't subsequently removed from office). It is therefore reasonable to query why impeachment proceedings against George Bush have only been countenanced so hesitantly and only now. Even at this juncture there is little support for the impeachment of George Bush from the Democrats or the media. </p> <p>It's interesting to compare the impeachment efforts in Pakistan and the US, given their stark contrasts. Pakistan is a desperately poor, lower-tier power mired in years of corruption and a recent upsurge in violence instigated in part by elements of its own military intelligence. The US, in comparison, is the wealthiest, most powerful nation on the planet. Yet it too has been mired in political corruption and economic scandals. In their own ways, the countries share an alarming addiction to military corporatism. Both Pakistan under Musharraf and the US under Bush favour military solutions to political problems.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the house, <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/30/house_speaker_nancy_pelosi_defends_her\">opposes</a> impeachment because \"it would be divisive for the country\". But, \"if somebody had a crime that the president had committed,\" she mentioned flippantly on American television recently, \"that would be a different story.\" Presumably the jury is out on Iraq until photos of Bush doing the thumbs-up at Abu Ghraib are unearthed. Barack Obama has decided to steer clear of the issue entirely. His stand could be excused on account of immediate political expediency. In one sense, he has very little to gain from supporting impeachment. John McCain would get free ammunition to line up Obama for the standard unpatriotic Democrat rhetoric.</p> <p>Of course, all of this raises the question of what precisely politicians are meant to be doing if they always dodge politically risky issues. Just prior to gaining control of Congress in 2006, the Democrats raced to quash rumours that they would seek to impeach Bush. Pelosi argued, credibly, that such moves would only act as fodder for Republicans seeking to avoid likely defeat. \"Making them lame ducks is good enough for me,\" Pelosi told the 60 Minutes programme. She repeated this argument in <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1828320,00.html\">Time</a> only last week.</p> <p>Sadly, impeachment proceedings did not start after the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. What followed was a lame duck Democratic party consistently voting to support America's continued occupation of Iraq. It was left instead to Dennis Kucinich, the maverick congressman from Ohio, to launch independent proceedings against Bush and Dick Cheney. His efforts have been joined by a number of citizen activists that includes the man who prosecuted Charles Manson.</p> <p>Since its election <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/02/20/asia/OUKWD-UK-PAKISTAN-ELECTION.php\">victory</a> in February, Pakistan's coalition government has been chided by western observers for dithering in the face of a resurgent Taliban movement. It is true that the government's two major powerbrokers, Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, have largely been more interested in turf wars than mounting a consistent policy platform. And yes, the impeachment proceedings are politically motivated. Ordinary Pakistanis are hurting as the cost of fuel and basic foodstuffs increases at an alarming rate (by a <a href=\"http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/statistics/price_statistics/weekly_spi/report.pdf\">whopping 32% (pdf)</a> in July alone). The coalition government has been blaming Musharraf for these ills. Impeachment gives Sharif and Zardari further ammunition to stave off an electorate with little faith in them.</p> <p>But for whatever reasons, Pakistan's politicians have taken a calculated risk. If they fail it will only serve to validate Musharraf. That they decided to proceed regardless is something to celebrate. Democracies, let alone coalition governments in a country as volatile as Pakistan, are complex animals. The impeachment proceedings against Musharraf are proof that Pakistan's politicians can occasionally rise above their nation's traumas to seek accountability for a dictator who has been consistently supported by the west.</p> <p><em>This article was amended at 12:40 on Friday August 8</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>11.15am</strong> A disastrous start to a crucial day for Lancashire <em>writes Andy Wilson at Old Trafford</em>, who have already lost two more wickets to slump to 14 for three in their second innings - still 96 behind. And Sussex haven't even brought on their spinners yet. It's Robin Martin-Jenkins and Jason Lewry who have done the damage, Martin-Jenkins claiming the key wicket of Paul Horton, edging a good ball that lifted and left him to first slip where Ollie Rayner took his second good catch of the innings. Then Lewry yorked nightwatchman Gary Keedy to leave Lancashire in an even bigger mess. If, as looks likely, they lose this game, their outside championship hopes will fade even further, and questions will be asked by an increasingly disgruntled membership.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> This match could be over today if the forecasts of yet more rain are wide of the mark, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Taunton</em>. At lunch Somerset are 199-3, which means they lead by just 75 runs and Notts are looking perky about their prospects of extending their lead at the top of the First Division.</p> <p>Somerset have a strong batting line-up, at least on paper, but it is still has a top-heavy look to it when Marcus Trescothick and Justin Langer are opening up, and their dismissals gave the fielding side huge encouragement on a pitch which has flattened out after the menaces of the opening day.</p> <p>Trescothick and Langer took their opening partnership to 136 before the latter was caught by Graeme Swann at second slip off the bowling of Charlie Shreck. He had scored 73 in a very determined innings. Trescothick went for 81, driving at a wide delivery from Andre Adams and slashing it to gully. And just before lunch Somerset lost their third wicket when Zander de Bruyn, driving, was bowled for 22. Somerset have a long way to go this afternoon, with much depending on the in-form Peter Trego.</p> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> This remarkable game turned on its head again this morning <em>writes Mike Averis at the Rose Bowl</em>. Yorkshire, level overnight, lost five wickets in five overs for 10 runs, and nine in the session for 98 runs, while James Tomlinson became the first bowler in the top division to pass 50 wickets.</p> <p>Until 30 minutes after tea yesterday the match had barely been worth waking for. Then Hampshire lost eight wickets in the session as 20-year-old Adil Rashid finished with career best figures of seven for 107, the wrist spinner getting considerable turn and some bounce from a second-day pitch.</p> <p>This morning it initially seemed just a matter of time before Imran Tahir got his hands on the ball, the Hampshire pace and swing bowlers rarely troubling the batsmen as Yorkshire scooted along to 45 without loss in 10 overs, Andrew Gale rattling up 31 from 41 deliveries.</p> <p>Tomlinson, with 47 championship wickets before today, was pulled from the attack after conceding 17 from two overs, Dimitri Mascarenhas choosing to fiddle through two overs himself before handing the ball to Tahir. The impact was immediate - the much-travelled 29-year-old taking wickets with consecutive balls in his first over. The fifth bowled Gale, turning back through the gate, while the googly did for Anthony McGrath, pinned on the crease for a first-ball duck.</p> <p>Three overs later Chris Tremlett made way for Tomlinson at the Pavilion End and the results were seismic, the left arm swing bowler picking up two wickets with his first two deliveries and four in five overs to leave Yorkshire at 66 for six.</p> <p>The first was gifted, Jacques Rudolph reaching for a short, wide delivery which was moving even further away. The second saw Adam Lyth looking for movement, but trapped lbw.</p> <p>Tomlinson's following over began with a rapid, rising ball which passed under Gerard Brophy's nose. The fourth was much the same only this time Brophy attempted a forcing shot, got an edge and Nic Pothas dived in front of first slip to give Tomlinson his 50th wicket of the season. The 51st, Rashid, had the same cast list although this time Pothas took the finest of edges and Tomlinson finished the spell with four for 14 from six overs.</p> <p>With mayhem being played out at the other end, Chris Taylor appeared to have found a way of playing Tahir. Either a big left foot was plonked down the pitch, or the opener looked to play off the wicket. However, when he and Rana Naved had added 21 the leg failed to get far enough forward and Taylor was gone, lbw for 23, with Tahir then fooling David Wainwright into not offering a shot.</p> <p>Tahir's figures were four for 28 when David Balcombe ended the session by finding the edge of Matthew Hoggard's bat, with Naved undefeated on 21.</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> Sussex continue to outplay Lancashire comprehensively, despite a valiant captain's effort by Stuart Law, <em>writes Andy Wilson at Old Trafford</em>. He's still there on 53 but at 116 for six, Lancashire are only six runs ahead. Two more wickets for Sussex's impressive young off-spinner Ollie Rayner, giving him seven for the match so far - Iain Sutcliffe caught at slip off bat and pad, and Steven Croft making a horrible error of judgment as he played no shot to a ball that pitched outside off stump and turned behind his backside to hit middle and leg. Francois du Plessis is the other man to go since the last update, also shouldering arms, in his case to an inswinger from the admirable Lewry.</p> <p><strong>4.28pm</strong> Notts still look like they're going to win this one but the Somerset tail are putting up a fight, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Taunton</em>. At tea they are 312 for eight, which means, in old money, that they lead by 188. Steffan Jones is doing his best to impersonate England's new captain at the moment, with a flurry of strokes all round the wicket.</p> <p>And at the other end Andrew Caddick, short of cricket and runs, has started to look something like his old self. If they can push that lead up to 250 it could be interesting, though the weather forecast for tomorrow is dire. But Somerset were let down by too many of their recognised batsmen this afternoon. You can't really blame Justin Langer and Marcus Trescothick, because they built the foundations of the innings with that 136 opening stand.</p> <p>But after Zander de Bruyn was bowled, driving, just before lunch, Ian Blackwell mis-hooked to fine leg and James Hildreth flailed a Twenty20 last over shot to mid-on. Both men needed runs. Blackwell, in particular, doesn't look his old self. Or to put that another way, he does look his old self but under the new regime at Taunton that doesn't quite fit any more. Peter Trego carried a big responsibility but unlike some of the others he was got out, pushing forward to one that left him.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 4 billion people left without water. Up to 5 billion at risk of flooding. Half a billion left hungry as agricultural yields decline by 15-35% in Africa with entire swaths of the world ceasing food production altogether. More than 80 million exposed to malaria in Africa. The Amazon collapses and 50% of species go extinct. It's basically the end of the world. And it's reported in this morning's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">Guardian</a>.</p> <p>There is such a gaping chasm between the matter-of-fact reporting of this nightmarish 4C scenario that government scientists now say we should be planning for, and the total failure of apparently rational people to understand what is happening on the Hoo peninsula this week. </p> <p>Reports from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Kingsnorth</a>, the site of this year's climate camp, completely fail to scrutinise the pin-striped criminals who are pushing the planet towards the brink. Instead, the Press Association runs stories on apparent conspiracies to attack police with knives without even phoning the accused activists for a reaction to these smears. What other set of people could be accused of conspiracy to commit cop killings without being asked for any reaction? This is a victory for the <a href=\"http://www.medwaymessenger.co.uk/news/default.asp?article_id=46009\">police</a> and the rightwing media they leak to. </p> <p>Equally, E.ON UK's greenwashing PR campaign is run without any question. Every report repeats the myth that the proposed new power station would be a \"cleaner coal\" plant. No one reports that in fact, this coal plant will pollute as much as more than 30 developing countries combined, that there will be no use of carbon capture and storage (CSS) technology, and that the plant will be so inefficient as to waste half of all the energy it creates. No mention of the fact that Chris Davies, the Lib Dem MEP, who is notoriously pro-CCS coal, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/kingsnorthclimatecamp.liberaldemocrats\">pledged</a> to attend the camp precisely because Kingsnorth won't be a \"cleaner coal\" plant.</p> <p>E.ON UK keeps pumping out the spin that \"we need coal to keep the lights on\", even following reports in the Financial Times that independent energy experts, P\u00f6yry, have <a href=\"http://www.ilexenergy.com/pages/230_%20Implications%20of%20the%20UK%20meeting%20its%202020%20Renewable%20Energy%20target%20v1.0.pdf\">proven (pdf)</a> that if the UK hit its existing renewables and efficiency targets, no new coal would be required. Even when emails <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists\">expose</a> close contact between E.ON UK and the business department, they are only reported in the Guardian. </p> <p>As the prime minister has a last look at a bit of beautiful coastline already succumbing to the sea, the media frenzy focuses on the same old soap opera personality politics. Is so-and-so too remote/young/jaded/damaged to be the next majorette marching us over the cliff? Whoever it is, we know it'll be one of the same crew who got us into this mess and can't get us out because the solutions don't fit the electoral cycle. There is an echo here too of the US media's response to Iraq. Even now, anyone who opposed the war is on some sort of \"radical fringe\", and having supported the war, at least at the time of its inception, is a necessary qualification to be seen as \"serious\". With climate change, in order to be \"serious\" you need to acknowledge that the end of the world is an interesting detail in the broader pattern of economic \"progress\", but never succumb to the incredible naivety of the protesters, who fail to realise that the survival of life on earth is a bourgeois luxury which we can ill afford in these times of economic constraint.</p> <p>The harsh reality is that there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/carbonemissions.climatechange\">no way</a> we could plan for a 4C rise. No amount of adaptation is going to make that liveable for most of the world's population, and it's going to be pretty damn nasty for those lucky few of us living in the north as well. Despite this, we end up with two possible stories \u2013 the front page banner \"dangerous anarchists threaten chaos\", or, tucked away at the back of the paper, \"peaceful protest passes without incident\". And all the time, not even the liberal press is concerned that, even if every single person at the camp arrived with a heavy machine gun, they couldn't kill half the number of people who will die as a result of the effects of climate change.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china\">opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics</a> will inevitably be an occasion for admiring comment about the immense achievements \u2013 architectural, organisational and presentational \u2013 of the host nation. This, of course, is precisely what the Chinese authorities hoped for when they secured their Olympic bid seven years ago. It was intended as a statement of China's modernity, its economic prowess and its rise to the top table of world power. Judging from the coverage so far, there are plenty of people willing to accept this image at face value. Yes, human rights groups have raised some awkward questions, but why should that spoil the party when so many world leaders will be on hand to give their blessing to the proceedings?</p> <p>Despite the fact that I campaigned hard for a <a href=\"http://www.emcmillanscott.com/campaign01.html\">political boycott of the Beijing Olympics</a>, I wish the athletes well and hope the competition passes without a repeat of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/04/china?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">terrorist attack</a> that happened earlier this week in Xinjiang province. What I don't want is for those watching to be in any doubt about the nature of the regime these games have been designed to benefit. Beyond the mesmerising Bird's Nest stadium is a country presided over by a terror state responsible for some truly appalling crimes against humanity. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/olympics2008.china\">the stadium's designer, Ai Weiwei</a>, was moved to disown the games describing the human rights situation as \"appalling\". The countless victims imprisoned, tortured and murdered by the Chinese state also deserve to be part of this Olympic story. They should not be too far from our thoughts as the gold medals are being handed out.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.thechinadebate.org/en/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/05/china19547.htm\">Human Rights Watch</a> are in agreement that far from honouring their pledge to improve human rights as a result of hosting the Olympics, the Chinese authorities have used the games as an excuse to intensify domestic repression. Much of this abysmal record is widely known about. There is no freedom of expression and the authorities go to extraordinary lengths to control information and restrict access to the internet. Dissent is punished severely, with those considered a threat imprisoned without trial and often without any information about their location or condition. The death penalty is applied extensively and for relatively minor non-violent crimes like tax fraud. The use of torture is frequent according to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=16777&amp;Cr=rights&amp;Cr1=China\">Manfred Nowak</a>, the UN's special rapporteur on torture, including beatings, electrocution and the removal of fingernails. The violent suppression of Tibetan rights and cultural identity is well documented. Moreover, some of these methods appear to be for export. BBC Panorama <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7503428.stm\">recently exposed </a>China's role in arming the Sudanese government in its genocidal campaign in Darfur.</p> <p>The victims of Chinese state terror are numerous and include human rights defenders, lawyers, trade unionists, environmentalists, campaigners for regional autonomy and anyone who seeks to challenge state policy. One person I am particularly concerned about is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Zhisheng\">Gao Zhisheng</a>, a Nobel prize nominee sometimes referred to as \"China's conscience\". As one of his country's top lawyers, he was targeted by the regime for speaking out about human rights abuses and has been in detention and subjected to torture since he wrote a critical open letter about the Olympics last year. It is essential that the UK and other countries across the world raise his case with the Chinese authorities as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>One of the groups that Gao has been most prominent in defending has been the religious movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong\">Falun Gong</a>. Members of this group have been on the receiving end of some of the most brutal abuse imaginable. Many foreign observers are easily frightened off by the Chinese government's designation of it as an \"evil cult\", but Falun Gong is a harmless Buddha-school set of spiritual exercises that is persecuted mainly because its popularity is deemed to pose a threat to the \"guiding role\" of the Chinese Communist party. A decade ago it had up to 100 million adherents. </p> <p>Falun Gong supporters are routinely imprisoned for their beliefs and are believed by Manfred Nowak to make up the majority of prisoners subjected to torture. But they are also the principal victims of China's most horrific crime against humanity \u2013 the harvesting of human organs from prisoners to supply the country's burgeoning transplant business. With transplants running at more than 10,000 a year, and with a harvested heart fetching up to $160,000, this is a profitable enterprise for the People's Liberation Army which organises it and pockets the proceeds. </p> <p>Unfortunately the organs used are far from surplus to requirements. A report written last year by the former Canadian secretary of state, David Kilgour, and the human rights lawyer, David Matas, concluded: \"there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners.\" Falun Gong prisoners are the only ones routinely subjected to urine and blood tests, with strong reason to believe that significant numbers of them are subsequently killed to order.</p> <p>There is no sign that this appalling practice is about to stop, either. Earlier this year, the Chinese authorities announced that they were adopting a lethal injection as the means of capital punishment instead of a bullet through the head \u2013 the mouth was propped open to minimise damage, but it is still a messy way to kill. It is not hard to understand this change. In one province alone, 16 buses have been specially adapted to perform on-the-spot eviscerations.</p> <p>This is the reality behind the facade of modernity presented by the Beijing Olympics. Although the political boycott of the opening ceremony will be nothing like as widespread as the seriousness of the human rights situation in China demands, it is not too late to register a protest against the terror state behind these games. I hope that Gordon Brown will reconsider his decision to attend the closing ceremony later this month. I also hope that those watching at home will take some time out from enjoying the sport to consider the enormous human suffering that is the reality of daily life for many Chinese people.</p>",

It brings the skipper in and he plays and misses at his first, the ball holding its line, just as Bell's did.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 58-2 (Cook 24, Pietersen 2)</strong><br>Holy cow, I've never seen an inbox fill up so quickly. \"The Bill\" offers James Larcombe, Neil Stainer and myriad others. \"T\" says Ian Cheney, who has a better grip on the whole idea of Hangman. \"Top Gear\" says Andy Sweeney and myriad others. \"The Wire,\" says David Scally and myriad others (many of whom take the opportunity for a dig at the Guardian's 'obsession' with it - have to say that must have passed me by. \"New Ball\" says Chris Brock (and nobody else).

You can count on him to wilt in the heat like a bag of spinach. Grrr.\" Morkel beats Cook with a beaut that slants viciously across the left-hander. It's not been easy out there for the batsmen thus far.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 67-2 (Cook 24, Pietersen 10)</strong><br>Nel replaces Ntini, as a direct consequence of Pietersen's ability to whip the latter through the on side from wide of off stump. It's a smart move, with Nel moving the ball away from the right hander and Pietersen struggling to get bat on ball. Maiden. \"Re. some of you're hangman entrants - Neil Stainer, David Scally and Andy Sweeney.,\" writes Owen Bailey. \"I'm thinking a classic 70's style Cop show with detectives Scally and Stainer taking on arch villain Andy Sweeney ...

Cook hooks, in a way horribly reminiscent of the last Test ie not totally in control, but picks up a single. Paul Thompson has leapt heroically to the defence of England's much-loved/much-derided No3. \"Little Belly had absolutely no chance today \u2013 he was buggered if he did and buggered if he didn't,\" he writes. \"Make a score and they'll say he can only do it when it doesn't matter, or fail and say he's not good enough to bat at three.\" Good point, well made.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 70-2 (Cook 26, Pietersen 10)</strong><br>Cook dinks a single off the last ball of the over as Nel keeps things tight. \"I'll take on all comers at rock, paper, scissors,\" writes James Maltby. \"I play rock. Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that!\" Of all the possible rain-break games mooted today, that is the one I'm least convinced about as a viable email sport.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 70-2 (Cook 26, Pietersen 10)</strong><br>It's genuinely remarkable how much Bell divides opinion. Having printed Murray Paterson's email in the 21st over, there was a flurry (well, four or five) of pro-Bell missives. After printing Paul Thompson's in the 23rd over, all the anti-Bell brigade have been spurred into action. To be honest, there's just too many to get through, but I'd say there's a 70-30 split with the antis coming out on top.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 70-2 (Cook 26, Pietersen 10)</strong><br>Nel keeps things tidy again, until Pietersen strides down the pitch for a defensive shot.

Charles Courtney wonders whether \"'Power of Richard Dawkins' beat 'some kind of fire' in Atheist Rock Paper, Scissors Deluxe Edition?\" And here's Nick Williamson: \"Reckon water would have the beating of your 'some sort of fire' (unless a chip pan, of course).

The Bell debate shows no sign of abating. \"Just thought I'd point out that Bell averages 42.92 putting him 33rd in the all time list of England test averages, fractionally behind Alistair Cook (32nd) and ahead of Graham Gooch (35th),\" writes Oli Rule. \"Of those batting in the last 25 years, only Pietersen, Thorpe, Gower, Trescothick, Robin Smith and Cook are ahead of him. Graham Hick averaged 31.32 and Mark Ramprakash 27.32. I'm not sure the comparison stacks up.\" Yep, I'd agree. It's not really a like-for-like comparison (or even a particularly worthwhile one). Just putting it out there for debate.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 106-2 (Cook 39, Pietersen 32)</strong><br>Right tech problems sorted. We should be OK now.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Cook 39 c Boucher b Ntini (36th over: England 111-3 (Pietersen 37, Collingwood 0)</strong><br>Smith brings back Ntini, with a couple of fielders placed conspicuously on the leg-side to force KP to play to the off, and the plan almost works immediately, Pietersen edging just short of AB de Villiers. \"I'm mystified why Bell gets such opprobrium \u2013 is it because like Gower he makes batting look so damned easy that it's a frustrating when he nicks one?\" I think Dave Martin might have a point there. \"How about a game of Cricket Super Top Trumps?\" suggests Patrick Kemp, returning us to our OBO games riff. \"I've got Harmison: Batting: 1, Bowling: 8, Fielding: 4, Temprament: 4, Likeability: 6. I'll risk playing Likeability, here's hoping you've got a Smith or an Inzy.\" Hang on, I've got Cook - Stupidity: 9. He's just slashed at a short wide one, feathering it to Boucher. What an awful, awful way to get out. England get Nelson-ed.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 116-3 (Pietersen 42, Collingwood 1)</strong><br>Cook's untimely exit brings Collingwood to the crease for a tricky 10 minutes before lunch. To get off the mark he scampers a single to mid-wicket, but McKenzie's too quick for him, throws at the stumps at the non-strikers end. If he'd hit, Collingwood was gone, no doubt about it. A real escape for England there. \"Oli Rule (34th over) has it completely wrong: the Bell-Hick-Ramprakash debate isn't about numbers,\" writes Darren Kilfara. \"It's about the same sense of exasperation they give you in promising so much and delivering so much less.\" Hmm. That also gets to the nub of the debate, I guess. Bell's fans (of whom I'd consider myself one) can point to the stats, while his detractors have the more intangible, but no less real, sense of disappointment.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 116-3 (Pietersen 42, Collingwood 1)</strong><br>Last over before lunch and Pietersen's happy to leave what he can - a captain's over prior to the break. I'd say honours even for the morning session, with Old England at the beginning and end, and plenty of New England in the middle. <br>Thanks for all your emails - I've been inundated so apologies if you sent over a zinger that slipped through the net - and be sure to join Tom Bryant after lunch, a fully grown man with the email address of a 12-year-old cartoon character.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Afternoon everyone:</strong> Right, straight in with a question: \"Cook \u2013 has he got the potential to be world class or is he an average player punching above his weight? Discuss,\" emails Ian Palmer. I'm in the former camp, Ian, it remains to be seen what everyone else thinks though ...</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Certainly</strong> Cook's dismissal means South Africa will be munching their sandwiches, cake and the like with a certain sense of satisfaction. Paul Collingwood probably wasn't too chuffed about it either because it hasn't looked terribly easy for the batsmen this morning. Still, Cook certainly has one thing in his favour: \"It is a well known fact that most genii tend to have an unfeasibly shaped jaw,\" reckons Paul Scott, so that must mean Cook is alright.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>That clickety-clack</strong> sound means the South Africans are trotting down the steps at The Oval. Behind them comes KP, without a helmet which he's left on the pitch to dry, and Collingwood looking a bit nervous.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 124-3 (Pietersen 42, Collingwood 9)</strong> Kallis takes the first over after lunch and sends one swinging away outside off, before putting another onto Collingwood's hips, which he tickles down to fine leg for four. Three dots follow before Kallis puts another onto his feet and it's flicked to square leg for another disdainful four. Meanwhile, on the subject of Cook's jaw: \"David Coulthard is no genius, neither is that lady reporter/presenter off TV's London Tonight. Nor Buzz Lightyear for that matter,\" writes David Wholey.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 124-3 (Pietersen 42, Collingwood 9)</strong> Ntini is bowling from wide of the crease, so Pietersen is counter-acting it by taking a gentle stroll across his crease towards the slips each time he approaches. The result? A series of leaves and prods - could be an interesting contest.</p> <p>\"I think KP and his approach to training could do young Cooky a world of good. Let's face it he's not having a great match and an unremarkable series but he has the potential, the brain and the ambition ... he's just not the finished article yet,\" writes Elizabeth Connor, before revealing the real reason she wants him in the team: \"Let's face it without him we'd drop in the phwoar rankings ... our rankings have never been as good without Simon Jones.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 129-3 (Pietersen 42, Collingwood 13)</strong><br>Kallis sends down another few balls swinging away from Collingwood. The second nearly ends up in the hands of second slip and is rightly called a wide. The third has Collingwood unwisely offering his edge. Fortunately he doesn't offer quite well enough and gets away with it. He responds by sending a short one to the boundary with a back-foot off-drive. In other news, I've managed to break the computer system here for the second time today, so apologies for the delay in that last over \u2013 and, indeed, this one.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 133-3 (Pietersen 46, Collingwood 13)</strong> There could have been a huge amount to report from that over for all I know but, due to the aforementioned technical shennanigans, I missed all of it. KP did score a four, though - an edge through the slips.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 139-3 (Pietersen 46, Collingwood 19)</strong> Collingwood flays a wild bat at a short one from Kallis, which loops high into the air square-leg from a top edge, and he gets away with it - even scoring two. Undeterred, he attempts the same thing a few balls later. The bat makes a noise that suggests it's hollow, Collingwood's hand comes off the handle and, somehow, it still goes for four. Kallis makes his opinions very clear to the batsman.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 143-3 (Pietersen 50, Collingwood 19)</strong> \"KP should've left the helmet off a la Viv Richards, who he's currently being compared to,\" says Ed Hawkesworth. \"And it wouldn't matter if he got brained by a bouncer because, as he has repeatedly said, he captains with his gut.\" He may have one or two problems in the gut department - or actually, a little lower than the gut, in truth - as he's just taken an inside edge straight into his 'hot spot'. Next ball, he waits until Ntini gets into his delivery stride before holding his arms up and backing away from the crease. It annoys Ntini enough for him to send down a short ball, which KP hoiks over square-leg for a four and a much deserved 50.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 144-3 (Pietersen 50, Collingwood 20)</strong> Morkel is back on, which is a wise idea as Kallis was beginning to get a bit out of shape. Collingwood tucks a fourth-ball single away off his legs before the field is set for Pietersen. The idea seems to be to dig it in short, get KP hooking and, thus, caught. They'll have to find a new ball, first, though as this one has been bludgeoned out of shape. The England captain decides to use the slight delay to leg it into the dressing room - and then comes back on doing up his trousers. But did he wash his hands? We should be told. \"I think this will conclude the jaw thing,\" says Paul Scott, a little presumptuously. \"Charles V of Spain - was ruler of the Holy Roman Empire from 1519 until his abdication in 1556 and also ruler of the Spanish realms from 1516 until 1556. Charles V suffered from an enlarged lower jaw. He struggled to chew his food properly and consequently experienced bad indigestion for much of his life. also He suffered from joint pain, presumed to be gout, according to his 16th century doctors.\" But, the question still remains: was Charles V a potential world beater or merely a decent opening bat?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 148-3 (Pietersen 50, Collingwood 24)</strong> <br>Ntini comes charging in, digs in a short one, and then Collingwood rocks back and slogs him over midwicket for a four. Take that! The bowler takes his medicine and pitches the next five up, forcing Collie onto his front foot. The TV pictures of the old ball don't make it look <em>that</em> out of shape. It only looks a bit scuffed, to be honest. Certainly not the sort of thing the band of cricketing occasionals to which I sometimes belong would dismiss in the Maida Vale nets of a Wednesday evening. Meanwhile: \"how is that every OBO writer complains of technical problems? Just what is going on? Are you guys running 286s on 56k dial-up?\" asks Alex McGillivray. If I had any idea what \"running 286s on 56k dial-up\" meant I'd tell you. As it is, we'll just have to call the jinx of the OBO. The technical people sitting behind me get twitchy every time I look in their direction.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 151-3 (Pietersen 53, Collingwood 24)</strong> After knocking away a couple off his legs, Pietersen nearly falls into Morkel's trap. He hooks a short one, gets a top edge and it loops between Ntini and Harris at fine-leg and square-leg respectively. They fail to call clearly and, at the last minute, Ntini takes a a desperate lunge and can't quite get underneath it. That should have been Harris's and it should have been out.</p> <p>A good point this from Angus Saunders: \"Isn't part of England's problem of the past couple of years down to the similarities between Cook and Strauss, and the lack of a positive hitter in the opening partnership? Tresco took the game to the opposition and softened the ball - pretty much every batsman's average was higher when Tresco was around, with the exception of Pietersen. Now we end up stumbling into our middle order with a low score and expect the likes to Bell and Collingwood to dig us out of holes we shouldn't be in. It's not Bell's fault he's having to bat in crucial situations nearly all the time.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>The light</strong> has been offered to the England batsmen who, perfectly sensibly, take it and trot from the field. With a three and a half days left in the game and that top edge weighing on his mind, that was probably the correct decision - albeit a boring one - as it does look a bit murky out there.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>The question, then:</strong> Who should replace Strauss - as mooted by OBO reader Ian Palmer? It's a tricky one as, for my money, Cook should clearly still be in the team. Strauss's failure to be offered the captaincy surely means his time is nearly up and perhaps he should not be expecting to be eating curry for Christmas. On the subject of bad light, Mike Holland asks, \"if i turn off the lights off in my office, can I go home early?\" Alas not, Mike, as they'll just turn them back on again - as they've done at The Oval, where play is about to resume.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 157-3 (Pietersen 58, Collingwood 25)</strong> Ian Botham says, \"a short break - not quite sure what that was for.\" Who's money is on Botham being asked to find another place for his unique talents once Michael Vaughan wrangles his way into the Sky commentary box? Nel is on and concedes a couple of singles - one apiece to KP and Collie. Hmmm, KP and Collie. Does that sound like a bad cop show to anyone else? Finally Nel pitches one up, on middle and off, and KP swishes it casually through midwicket for a majestic four. Classy stuff.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 161-3 (Pietersen 61, Collingwood 26)</strong> <br>Morkel bowls a tightish line but Collingwood manages a casual single before KP prods a short one into the ground and, as it rolls towards the boundary, the batsmen run two. Good running. From the last, KP nicks another single to bring up the 50-partnership. \"Key for opening bat,\" suggests Clive Wallis, who is patently mental. \"He's almost Banger-esque in his new ball butchery and he's matured since the 02/03 Ashes tour,\" is his reasoning. \"Hmmmm,\" is my considered response. Paul Frangi may have hit the nail on the head: \"Billy Godleman at Middlesex might be one for the future, if not the present. I always like a right hand/left hand opening pair though to break up the bowlers' line, sadly I can't think of any decent RH English openers at the moment.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 165-3 (Pietersen 65, Collingwood 26)</strong> Gunther is doing his best , \"I'm crazy, me\". Last over he threatened to throw down Pietersen's stumps for no reason and, this over, he does it again. He gets little reaction so puts a man out on the hook and starts bowling around the wicket. KP falls for it again, the idiot, and smacks up another skier off the toe-end. Again the man under it is Ntini - this time at mid-on - again he dives and again he misses it. Nel goes beserk, obviously. Just what the hell is Pietersen playing at though? For all those who doubted KP's temperament to be captain - there's a shed-load of evidence for your cause. At least he managed to run a few of it, I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 165-3 (Pietersen 65, Collingwood 26)</strong> An excellent piece of fielding in the covers prevents a good four from Collingwood off his back foot. Other than that? Not much to see here. Amid the other people calling for Key to open the batting, people who are getting no more publicity for their crazy-talk from me, comes this from Richard Moore. \"He never gets mentioned but I'd like to throw Northants' Rob White's name into the ring. Mainly because people ignore me when I suggest Northants' David Sales.\" Nick Westacott takes Moore's White and trumps him with this: \"Drop Strauss and call up Joe Denly. He's more than capable of taking the Tresco role, building a solid opener's innings while knocking the shine off the ball. He's also a great one day and Twenty20 player so he could do the job in all forms of the game. He also benefits from being young enough not to suffer from the yips.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 166-3 (Pietersen 66, Collingwood 31)</strong> After a single from KP, Collingwood takes the strike. This time he gets his cut shot away to the boundary, before dabbing one down to fine leg, to allow Nel to come around the wicket at Pietersen again. Limply, he sends the ball well wide of the off stump and Pietersen leaves it alone. \"KP keeps banging on about 'singing off the same hymnsheet as Mooresey' \u2013 without saying what they are crooning together,\" says Charles Heymann. \"All Things Bright and Beautiful? Or Amazing Grace in view of his 'humility' this week\u2026</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>53rd over: England 176-3 (Pietersen 66, Collingwood 36)</strong> Morkel lands one on a good length, with a good high bounce on it, and Collingwood thinks a front-foot drive is the best bet. He misses it by a whisker and was lucky not to nick one behind. Next ball, he gets the same treatment, rocks onto his back foot, and clonks a four, courtesy of the South African fielder who is still holding it as he slides over the boundary rope. Incidentally, the number of people who have written into my inbox to suggest: \"How about that Vaughan fella at No1\"? 17. England trail by 18 runs, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>54th over: England 176-3 (Pietersen 66, Collingwood 36)</strong> Three or four over the wicket, one round it, and another back over it to Collingwood from Nel. The result is a maiden. \"England in recent years seem to have an aversion to re-picking those who they dropped a few years earlier, as though they don't want to admit that the next superstar isn't waiting in the wings for his chance,\" reckons Jon Donaghy. \"I don't mean Ramprakash or Hick, who did get lots of chances, but the likes of Key are good examples. If the Aussies picked their teams like that, Matt Hayden and Damien Martyn (for starters) would have had very short Test careers, instead of getting second chances a few years later and scoring shedloads of runs.\"</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>55th over: England 191-3 (Pietersen 81, Collingwood 36)</strong> Pietersen has been a bit stifled for the last few overs, so he takes full advantage of this one. He slaps a short one between midwicket and mid-on for four, then - making the most of his height - thumps another one straight back past the bowler in what is a beautiful straight drive. Morkel tries coming around the wicket, and bowls it short and wide, so KP sends it careering to the cover boundary. For his next trick, he runs a three down to mid-on. Expect Morkel to have a good, long think after that over. \"Re over 52,\" writes Alex Warwick. \"Instead of singing from the same hymn sheet as Mooresey he might mean he wants to sing with Morrissey, and his South African lilt is confusing people.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>56th over: England 199-3 (Pietersen 88, Collingwood 37)</strong> England take the lead after Nel allows two singles (one apiece) and a boundary through midwicket from Pietersen, before a quick double. Perhaps it would help Gunther is he didn't spend so much time varying which side of the wicket he's bowling. That boundary, by the way, elevates KP to sixth in the table of highest scores by an England player in their first match as captain. The leader? Andrew Strauss with 128. \"I too misread that entry in the 52nd over and thought he was singing with Morrissey,\" adds Patrick Jones. \"The Boy With The Vaughan In His Side? Perhaps not ...\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>57th over: England 199-3 (Pietersen 88, Collingwood 37)</strong> Harris is on and he manages to keep Collingwood tucked up for a maiden - much to Collie's annoyance considering he blattered a fully-fledged slog (that would have been a boundary) straight into Amla's shoulder at short-leg for no score. Phillip Dub emails in to say this: \"Is Colly really a certain of a place in India unless he posts a big score? I would think that he might still be replaced some time soon? Can we open up the debate as to who is going to replace him? Owais?\" The very next second, Keiron Smith closes up the debate by saying this: \"Though I rate Shah as a very good batsman, the problem is that both him and Bopara are playing Second Division cricket which does not have the bowling attacks or the intensity of the First Division, so it is a lot easier to score runs. As some are advocating, Denley is not ready. Let Key do the job.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>58th over: England 200-3 (Pietersen 89, Collingwood 37)</strong> The 200 is up, thanks to a KP single, and drinks are being taken. Clive Wallis is hoping that a groundswell of backing in favour of his Key-for-England idea will make me retract my comments. \"In light of the subsequent support for Robert 'still partial to the pies' Key, are you prepared to withdraw your scurrilous accusation that I am mental?\" No, and I'm basing that on information received by one of your former colleagues: \"I used to work with a Clive Wallis, who was indeed patently mental,\" writes Patrick Foyle. \"Borderline OCD with a habit of shouting 'Come on you Spurs!' at odd, inopportune times in the 'office'.\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>59th over: England 203-3 (Pietersen 92, Collingwood 37)</strong> Pietersen moves into the 90s after picking Harris off - who seems to be relying on the Ashley Giles tactic of bowling 'the one that doesn't turn'. The Smiths, on the other hand, seem to be of far more pressing concern to those emailing me: \"I Know It's Over By Over,\" offers James Sharples. Before Alex Warwick chorltes: \"KP: Bigmouth Strikes Again. And, when we lose this test by 10 wickets, Heaven Knows I'll Be Miserable\".</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>60th over: England 203-3 (Pietersen 92, Collingwood 37)</strong> Pietersen suddenly goes into nervous mode. A slew of short wide ones from Nel meet with the toe-end of his bat and it's a maiden. \"Keiron Smith (over 57) has possibly made the best serious remark of the day,\" says Owen Bailey. \"The time is about right to stop talking about county averages as a whole and recognise who plays in which division. The standards are definitely different these days.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>61st over: England 203-3 (Pietersen 92, Collingwood 37)</strong> Harris sends down an entire over at or just outside the leg stump. Collingwood, awkwardly but uncomfortably, blocks them all out. \"If KP gets out soon to a top-edge or an skewed attempt at 6 down long-off's throat, century or not, how many people do you think will email you about his irresponsible look-at-me attitude and his lack of teamwork making him unsuitable to be captain?\" asks Sam Barritt. \"My guess is about the same as the number of idiots who blame Bell for most of England's problems. Please note I'm not the first. I think his ability to take the attack to any bowler in the world is key to New England's chances.\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>62nd over: England 207-3 (Pietersen 95, Collingwood 38)</strong> Ntini is back on and Pietersen takes a quick single off his hips to square-leg. Collingwood then nearly hands the bowler his wicket by swiping at a low short one outside the off stump. A poor shot that could have led to an edge. As it is, he nicks a single next ball and leaves his skipper to prod out the rest of the over before a misfield grants him two from the last ball of the over. \"Following the Headingley debacle, surely Panic would be the apposite Smiths tune, if only for the line 'Hang the DJ'?\" suggests Lee Calvert.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>63rd over: England 210-3 (Pietersen 96, Collingwood 40)</strong> A quick single from Collingwood puts KP on strike. Hmmm, five to get for his century, Harris bowling and mid-on sitting back. Will KP go for it? No. No he won't. He pads on away then trots through for a single. Collingwood then does the same. \"I agree that there are more considerations than just averages but disregarding Second Division players is a stupid idea,\" reckons Dan Smith. \"England has a small enough pool of talent to choose from as it is. Shah should get in, not for reasons of average, but because in the one-day side he has shown himself to be able to cope with pressure and to pace an innings according to the needs of the side.\"</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Pietersen 100 c Kallis b Ntini (64th over: England 219-4 (Collingwood 45, Flintoff 0)</strong> Collingwood nicks one through the vacant fourth slip area for four to bring up the 100 partnership then chops another to deep point for a single. His has been a watchful but very useful innings so far. There's a buzz of expectancy as Nel runs in with KP on 96 and he takes a step towards point, then steers the ball to the mid-on boundary for a four and his 14th Test hundred. A brilliant, sensible, dare I say, captain-like innings ... until he edges one two balls later straight into Kallis's hands at third slip.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>65th over: England 220-4 (Collingwood 46, Flintoff 0)</strong> Pietersen's hundred came from 135 balls but, unfortunately, his innings lasted only 137. A shame, really, as he could have gone on to score a hatful today. He didn't seem to be having any problems whatsoever. Perhaps he was so focussed on getting his first ton as captain that he forgot that he could have had two. \"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish,\" offers Simon Brooks.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>66th over: England 226-4 (Collingwood 49, Flintoff 3)</strong> Collingwood chops a two, then a single to the point boundary to go to 49. Bet he won't want to go into the approaching tea break on that. Flintoff then gets a thick edge, along the ground, for three down to third man. \"Surely we're just highlighting the reason why Bell, Collingwood et al have been so comfortable in the team and shouldn't be dropped any time soon,\" thinks Paul Birrell. \"There's absolutely no pressure coming from outside the team. The bowling attack has been rotated - this is not to say that they are to blame for poor results, merely that we have, by comparison, some strength in depth. When it comes to the top order.. well these guys look safe to me.\" Meanwhile, on the subject of The Smiths, Tom Ireland has this to add: \"Obviously, you'd hope every English batsmen keeps their Hand in Glove,\" before, quite rightfully, apologising, \"I'm so sorry. That's not even a good song.\"</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>67th over: England 232-4 (Collingwood 49, Flintoff 9)</strong> Harris looks absolutely sick. Flintoff just danced down the wicket to his first ball of the over and deposited him straight back over his head and into the stands for a huge six. He blocks out the rest of the over knowing he's succesfully got the upper hand there. And that's tea - good stuff from England, great stuff from KP. On the subject of England and The Smiths - that joke isn't funny anymore.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>Thanks for all your emails</strong>, apologies for the many hundreds I didn't use. I'm handing the reins back over to John Ashdown, who has a far more sensible email address than me.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>Evening all</strong>. Well, while KP and Colly spent the afternoon carting the South African attack to all parts, I've spent rather a lot of it attempting to devise a pub quiz to be played during a rain-break, involving two teams of OBO readers - the Belly Bashers and Team Bell Epoque - and full of questions that Google searches won't help with - what are the middle names of OBO stalwarts Bull, Smyth and Booth? What kind of TV am I OBOing from? My goat's cheese and pesto bagel lunch - a mistake that seemed like a good idea at the time or a fiesta of goaty flavour? It's looking reasonably bright now, though, so we probably won't get to play, which is a shame as there's nothing like the ego-trip of being quizmaster.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>Right, I'm laying down the law.</strong> The Smith's puns? They're over. Gone. Finito. No mas. Kaputski. Comprendez? Yes, I know I'm a spoilsport.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>Flintoff and Collingwood stride out</strong>, and they know a decent session here can give England a dominant advantage in the match. \"What about just 80's music puns?\" writes the impudent Alex Warwick. \"I just can't get enough of them.\" Grrrr ...</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Flintoff 9 c Boucher b Kallis (68th over: England 233-5 (Collingwood 50, Ambrose 0)</strong> <br>Kallis v Collingwood first up. It's pitched up and swingy, but Collingwood gets one away to bring up his half century. A gritty, actually very Collingwoodesque innings. Big Jacques then tempts Flintoff early doors and he's gone! A little bit of away movement, a slightly ill-judged straight push, and Boucher takes the catch. Raises a few question marks about Flintoff's suitability at No6.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>69th over: England 233-5 (Collingwood 50, Ambrose 0)</strong><br>Nick Terdre isn't the first to point out the success of the England women side today. \"For once the men aren't doing too badly but the women are going great <br>guns in their one-dayer against South Africa - 310 for 3 after an <br>opening stand of 268, pretty impressive, wouldn't you say? In their <br>reply the Saffer women are 45-7.\" Looks like they know how to press home an advantage, something that the men's side continue to struggle with.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>70th over: England 238-5 (Collingwood 54, Ambrose 1)</strong><br>Kallis trundles in again and Collingwood strikes a classical cover drive for four - see, he can be a good player to watch. \"I've finally found a good reason to have a blackberry,\" writes Paddy Blewer. \"Being able to keep up with the cricket whilst at the Great British beer festival! A riff to start the final session: match the England team to beer.\" Hmm, I see the words 'flat', 'bitter aftertaste' and 'you can knock them back too easily' marching with ill-advised confidence towards this OBO ...</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>71st over: England 239-5 (Collingwood 54, Ambrose 2)</strong><br>Harris comes twirling in, Ambrose pads away. \"Whilst not wanting to jump on your bandwagon, what is the point of batting Flintoff at No6 to balance the team when he is not even close to the type of form with the bat that would warant that position?\" writes Julian Bamford. \"Surely the plus of team balance is negated by the fragility of one of our middle order wickets.\" Well, it opens a real can of worms doesn't it? Is Flintoff's fragility at No6 offset by Broad at No8? And if Broad isn't deemed worthy for his bowling, and, say, Sidebottom or Hoggard returns, can Ambrose survive at No7?</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Ambrose 4 c Boucher b Kallis 4 (72nd over: England 241-6 (Collingwood 54, Broad 0)</strong><br>Ambrose gone! Kallis produces a good 'un, very similar to Flintoff's dismissal, sliding the ball down the corridor of uncertainty (has that been banned yet? It probably should be) and then shaping it away. Wasn't a good shot, though. More questions for England. \"Re. cricketers as beer,\" writes Paul Thompson (it is Friday afternoon after all). \"Jaques Kallis as a full-bodied stout?\" He's been a tasty premium since tea.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>73rd over: England 245-6 (Collingwood 58, Broad 0)</strong><br>After an over of more dibble than dobble, Collingwood hammers Harris over the top of mid-on for four. \"As far as England are concerned, all the best ones are brewed overseas,\" offers Peter Tranter (wasn't he in Red Dwarf?) in our beer/cricketers discussion.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>74th over: England 245-6 (Collingwood 58, Broad 0)</strong><br>\"The easiest solution to the middle order is Prior 6, Flintoff 7, Broad 8, not difficult,\" suggests a slightly full-of-himself James Huxtable. That makes sense, but if your bowling attack was, say, Anderson, Harmison, Panesar and Hoggard or Tremlett, then you'd be stuck with Anderson at 8, so if Prior can't quite live-up to expectations and Flintoff continues to struggle, you're in trouble. Broad has a scare with one that cuts back through the gate, but deals with the rest confidently.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>75th over: England 246-6 (Collingwood 59, Broad 0)</strong><br>Collingwood scampers a single and Broad keeps out Harris. Has anyone considered teaching Broad to keep wicket? Ambrose has to be fearing for his place now. \"England are Hofmeister\u2026.they all follow the Boer,\" writes Hughie Curtis to earn himself a 'bom tish'.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>76th over: England 247-6 (Collingwood 60, Broad 0)</strong><br>Collingwood chops Kallis away for a single. Young Broad remains decidedly circumspect. \"Ambrose: half-pint of Fosters - a weak, unsatisfying Australian that doesn't last very long?\" suggests Steven Rea.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>77th over: England 248-6 (Collingwood 61, Broad 0)</strong><br>\"Why don't we just get Bell to keep?\" asks Beth Connor. \"OK pair of hands, he's usually wearing a helmet near the wicket anyway ... seriously, why not?\" If anyone out there is knows their coaching apples, how easy is it to convert a regular batsmen to a keeper? Another single off the over, Broad has faced 19 balls and is yet to get off the mark.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Collingwood 61 c and b Kallis (78th over: England 248-7 (Broad 0, Anderson 0)</strong><br>Oh, for goodness sake! Kallis gets a little extra bounce and finds the shoulder of Collingwood's bat. A strange dismissal for a batsman who was well settled. Oh well, I suppose we should have suspected this - England have gone from 219-3 to 248-7. That brings Harmison out to the crease. All the hard work is evaporating once more ...</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>79th over: England 248-7 (Broad 0, Harmison 0)</strong><br>\"In answer to the question, how easy is it to convert a batsman to wicketkeeper in particular relation to Broad? The answer is, when he is close on 6'6\", you don't,\" suggests Daniel Butcher. Fair point. Phil Powell wriites to inform us that Andrew Strauss kept wicket at school and is therefore pretty useful. A maiden from Harris.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>80th over: England 254-7 (Broad 1, Harmison 5)</strong><br>Harmison guides one down to third man for four. New ball coming up. Rick Stubley has an idea from left-field. \"What about Bilal Shafayat? I understand he kept wicket for Notts as Chris Read had to leave the field and took three catches. Mind you, I don't know how many he dropped.\" So take a player who wouldn't get in the team for either batting or wicketkeeping as a batting wicketkeeper? Not sure that one's going to take off.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>81st over: England 256-7 (Broad 1, Harmison 6)</strong><br>South Africa neglect to take the new cherry, though, and it's Harris who continues. Harmison survives an lbw shout, then gets out the sweep. \"This keeping debate has to stop,\" demands Tom Denning, attempting to wizzle on everyone's fire. \"Your really only need the best keeper if you have a world class spin bowler, which at the moment Monty is certainly not. We just pick the best batsmen and get on with it.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>82nd over: England 260-7 (Broad 1, Harmison 10)</strong><br>Ntini comes back, still with the old ball, and Harmison drives his first through the covers for four. Smith has seen enough and hands his bowler the new ball, which Harmison proceeds to leave, leave and leave again. \"Liz Connor (77th over) raises a point that my Dad often argues,\" writes Rich McKinley. \"When, in the mid-90s, it became clear that wicketkeeper batsmen (Gilchrist, Stewart etc) were becoming the way forward, why didn't the England staff look to who they had in the youth system, chuck them a pair of gloves for half an hour at the end of a coaching session and see how they got on? As a batsman who was long earmarked as an England prospect, is nimble and has decent hands, Bell would've been an ideal candidate. I definitely don't know my coaching apples, but I'm guessing its much easier to teach someone between, say 16 and 20, than it is to suddenly convert them as a 25+ international.\"</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>83rd over: England 260-7 (Broad 1, Harmison 10)</strong><br>\"How easy is it to convert a batsman into a wicketkeeper?\" asks Kieron Smith rhetorically. \"Just take a look at Prior. He was a batsman who was converted into a keeper. He is a terrible keeper. According to Sussex supporters not even the third best keeper at the club.\" I suppose the question is, how many runs can a wicketkeeper's wicketkeeping earn/save a team? Even the very best drop the occasional howler, and if you can afford to allow Panesar et al shell catches right, left and centre, then, why can't you spare a few byes and the odd drop behind the stumps. Anyway, we're getting a bit bogged down here. Morkel, surprisingly wicketless in this innings, returns with a maiden.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Broad 1 c McKenzie b Ntini (84th over: England 264-8 (Harmison 13, Anderson 1)</strong><br>Harmison hits over the top to pick up three, but then Broad pokes at another wide one, with McKenzie snaffling the catch in the slips. He didn't really look comfortable at all out there. The weight of expectation perhaps? England's lead isn't going to be anywhere near what it should be. At least it brings Jimmy Anderson out and allows me to get in this little beery beaut: \"James Anderson is Stella Artois,\" writes Alan White. \"Reassuringly expensive.\"</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>85th over: England 264-8 (Harmison 13, Anderson 1)</strong><br>Morkel gives Anderson a bit of short stuff which the batsman does well to keep down. England's miserable collapse hasn't been pleasant viewing, but watching Glendenning in meltdown on the desk opposite me is amusement enough. He's on the verge of losing it over our Olympic rat. Marvellous.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>86th over: England 270-8 (Harmison 19, Anderson 1)</strong><br>Harmison gets away with a horribly skewed pull, then edges one just short of Kallis at second slip, before lifting one over the top gloriously for four. Ian Palmer suggests the big pace bowler is the English cricketing equivalent of Guiness, \"good at home, but doesn't travel well\", while Paddy Blewer also has a suggestion. \"Andrew Flintoff is Boddingtons,\" he writes. \"Creamy and heavy and from Manchester. Heavily marketed, but ultimately disappointing.\" I get most of that, but creamy?</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>87th over: England 276-8 (Harmison 24, Anderson 2)</strong><br>Somehow Anderson survives again as he lofts a drive vertically. It drops safe, frustratingly for the South African bowlers. Then Harmison has a huge swipe at a full one from Morkel, gets the edge, but it swerves manically after leaving the bat and Boucher is helpless to stop it. Four more - this could get interesting.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>88th over: England 279-8 (Harmison 27, Anderson 2)</strong><br>Another vertical drive, this one from Harmison, falls safe. Yes, all rather entertaining this. Anderson follows up with a couple of airy swishes. Perhaps Harmison is better seen as a tankard of Theakston's Old Peculier. You have a little too much of it, which puts you off for a while, but then when you have another taste you wonder why you've been settling for pale imitations for so long. Eh? What do you mean 'forced'?</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>89th over: England 287-8 (Harmison 32, Anderson 4)</strong><br>Harmison has another big thresh at a full one from Morkel, which flies backward of square for a one-bounce four. Amla then misses a nigh-impossible chance at short leg, with Anderson fortunate to escape as the ball ricochets away off the fielder's thigh. \"I'm well known (chiefly among people called Mrs. Millings) for not paying attention, but, um, Olympic rat?\" wonders Mac Millings. It's Olympic predicta-rat, coming to a theguardian.com video near you soon, much to the excitement of Mr Glendenning.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>90th over: England 290-8 (Harmison 35, Anderson 4)</strong><br>Harmison's mixing things up here, playing the odd flamboyant actual real-life cricket stroke amidst all the madcap flailing. This partnership is now worth an irksome 27.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>91st over: England 292-8 (Harmison 35, Anderson 5)</strong><br>Anderson digs out a decent attempted yorker from Morkel, then is lucky to get an inside edge onto one zooming in towards his stumps. Morkel manages a smile, but you have to wonder if the series was 1-1 whether there'd be quite so much good humour from the bowlers. I'm guessing not.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>92nd over: England 294-8 (Harmison 35, Anderson 7)</strong><br>Andre Nel returns and Anderson carts him away through the covers for a couple. That brings up the 100 lead. Jimmy celebrates with a big waft at the next one. I'm going to pretend he did that on purpose and missed it by a whisker, just to get on Nel's nerves. Just for good measure, he does it again a couple of balls later. Oh James, you are a one.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>93rd over: England 300-8 (Harmison 40, Anderson 7)</strong><br>Dibble, dobble, dibble, dobble ... here comes Paul Harris again. Harmison edges the first past slip for four more, then dances twinkle-toed down the pitch and drives straight back to Harris, and tops it off with a delicate little sweep to bring up the 300. He's nearing his best ever Test score here.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>94th over: England 309-8 (Harmison 45, Anderson 11)</strong><br>Play can go on to 7.10pm this evening, by the way. Harmison cuts impressively, joyously for four to take him past his previous best of 42. Then aims a slog somewhere in the direction of Norfolk. Fortunately for Nel, he fails to make contact. \"Blimey - Harmy the saviour of England!\" hails a triumphant Claire Davies. \"With the bat! This is strange stuff, eh?\" It is indeed, but excellent early evening entertainment. Just the right warm-up for a Friday night on the tiles. Or, in my case, as a prelude to going home and doing the dishes, cleaning the bathroom and generally cleaning up my flat ahead of my sister-in-law's visit tomorrow. Woo hoo!</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Anderson 13 lbw b Harris (95th over: England 316-9 (Harmison 49, Panesar 0)</strong><br>Harmison moos one down to cow corner off Harris for another boundary, then the crowd is up, mistaking a leg bye for a single. Anderson joins the party with an attempted reverse sweep - that's <em>an attempted reverse sweep</em> - before picking up another couple with the orthodox version. Then he inexplicably leaves a straight one, gets hit on the pad looking a little foolish as he stands up straight in front of the stumps. That brings Panesar to the crease with Harmison on 49. Ooh er.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Panesar 0 run out (England 316 all out - Harmison 49 not out)</strong><br>Harmison calls Monty through for a quick single of the second ball, but it'd be a suicide run with a doped up Ben Johnson at the non-strikers end. It takes a direct hit, but Panesar is nowhere to be seen. Harmison looks furious with himself, but he can take great pride in having guided England to a proper lead.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>So a lead of 122 for England</strong>. Not to be sniffed at. It was Harris, by the way, who threw down the stumps at the end there. Smith and McKenzie will face what is known in the game as 'a tricky little spell' before the close. Harmison and co will have half an hour or so to make an early breakthrough.</p> <p><strong>End of innings: England 316 all out</strong></p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Smith 0 lbw b Anderson (1st over: South Africa 0-1 (McKenzie 0, Amla 0)</strong><br>Anderson has Smith playing and missing at the second ball, which swings away and across the left-hander. The fifth is the inswinger and totally beats the South African captain. Pitches on middle, going on to hit middle, it's the easiest decision the umpires have had all day. Well, since giving Panesar out 10 minutes ago. But what a start for England. Belting stuff.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 7-1 (McKenzie 5, Amla 0)</strong><br>Harmison, looking a little red and sweaty after his hour-and-a-bit at the crease, charges in for a short, sharp burst. McKenzie drags his bat back inside the line of a short one <em>just</em> in time. Then he finds the edge, with McKenzie fortunate to see the ball fly through the gap in the slip cordon. First up to Amla is a leg side wild one that Ambrose should really collect but allows to pings of his fingertips for two runs. He's not done himself any favours today.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 12-1 (McKenzie 6, Amla 4)</strong><br>Anderson can't quite get the magic going this time, Amla cutting over the top of point/gully for four. The light is closing in, so we might not get many more overs in here.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 13-1 (McKenzie 7, Amla 4)</strong><br>All by myself. Don't wanna be, all by mysseeeellllff! I'd accept a couple of Morrissey puns at the moment, the OBO inbox is so quiet. And so is The Oval - South Africa's sensible batting from 0-1 has taken the wind out the crowd's collective sails in sarf Landan. Game of I-Spy, anybody?</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 19-1 (McKenzie 8, Amla 9)</strong><br>Lovely straight drive from Amla for four as Anderson strives for swing. <br>\"Has anyone ever been able to explain why a nick onto the stumps is out, while a nick onto the pads that would have taken out middle stump is not?\" asks Dave Langlois. I don't know for sure, Dave, but I'd imagine it would have something to do with the fact that an umpire couldn't possibly tell if an inside edge was heading to the stumps or down to fine leg for four.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 26-1 (McKenzie 8, Amla 16)</strong><br>\"I spy with my little eye something beginning with B,\" offers John Starbuck. \"No, it was a blackbird. If I had Sky, it would be a bloody useless keeper.\" Harmison's a little wide and wild this over - he looks cream crackered truth be told. Amla whacks one through the covers for four. \"Nothing to say but 'hi',\" writes Robin Smith (<em>the</em> Robin Smith?!) \"Greetings from hot St. Louis, where you're pretty much all I've got in terms of Test match cricket.\"</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 34-1 (McKenzie 8, Amla 24)</strong><br>Flintoff replaces Anderson and gets driven back down the ground by Amla for his troubles and outside-edged for another boundary. \"My partner's eldest little thing (call them children if you must) loves a game of I-Spy with colours, not letters,\" writes Richard Read. \"So I'll happily kick that one off if you like... I-spy with my little eye something beginning with Brown.\" Erm, brown sugar? Or are we looking for something that is brown? Like a twig? \"Don't give me all that crap about an empty in box!\" rallies David Keech. \"You OBOers are all the same. Moan and groan and in the meantime the inbox is full of 100s of e-mails to publish. Now - the quality? That's another thing! They are probably all as boring as this one so not worth publishing!\"</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 34-1 (McKenzie 8, Amla 24)</strong><br>Panesar hops in - probably to allow Flintoff time for another over before the close. \"Goiee!\" toots Ambrose as McKenzie forward defends. \"Oooarr,\" moan the close catches as McKenzie leaves a wide one. \"Goiee!\" toots Ambrose again, followed by a stifled \"Goa ...\" and then another \"Goiee!\". Despite all the noises, it's all entirely unthreatening.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 37-1 (McKenzie 9, Amla 26)</strong><br>Flintoff tries the double bluff, sending a man back for the hook then throwing in the yorker. McKenzie's equal to it though. And in attempting to force the batsmen to play, Flintoff errs a little on the straight side, allowing a couple of singles.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p>That's it for the day folks, with England leading by 85 or South Africa trailing by 85 if you prefer. Thanks for all your emails - particularly from the loyal little band at the death - and be sure to join James Dart (making a rare OBO appearance) tomorrow for full coverage. Cheerio!</p>",

  "<p>The number of homeowners having their properties repossessed jumped by 41% in the first half of this year to its highest level in 12 years, figures showed today.</p> <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said 18,900 properties had been taken into possession by lenders over the six months to June, compared with 12,300 in the second half of 2007.</p> <p>The figure is 48% higher than the number in the same period last year, suggesting rising mortgage rates and higher household costs are putting a squeeze on homeowners.</p> <p>The CML also reported an increase in the number of borrowers who had fallen behind on mortgage repayments.</p> <p>The number of households with arrears of three months or more increased to 155,600 in the first half of the year, up from 129,600 at the end last year.</p> <p>Despite the sharp increases in the number of homeowners facing problems with repayments, the CML said they still represented a small fraction of the 11.74m mortgages outstanding in the UK.</p> <p>Over the six-month period, 0.16% of homes financed with mortgages were taken into possession by a lender, compared with 0.11% last year.</p> <p>The CML said this was less than half of the rate recorded in the property crash of the early 1990s. The arrears rate rose to 1.33%, from 1.1% at the end of 2007. </p> <p>The organisation maintained its forecasts that repossessions will rise to 45,000 this year, from a round 30,000 last year, while the number of mortgages in arrears would increase to 170,000.</p> <p>The CML's director general, Michael Coogan, said the repossession figures needed to be kept in perspective: \"The good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full, despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals.\"</p> <p>But he said it was \"inevitable\" more borrowers would find themselves unable to cope in the coming months.</p> <p>Opposition parties pointed the finger of blame at the government, with the Conservatives accusing Gordon Brown of \"economic incompetence\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vince Cable said Brown had allowed the economy to get \"hopelessly out of control\". </p> <p>\"For years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked, and ordinary families are now feeling the effects,\" he said.</p> <h2>Last resort</h2> <p>Earlier this week, the Financial Service Authority said some lenders had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/06/mortgages.property1\">too quick to take action</a> against struggling borrowers and called on them to treat repossession only as a last resort. </p> <p>Coogan said lenders would work with the FSA to ensure borrowers were treated fairly. \"No-one wants to see a household lose their home, and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well. </p> <p>\"The focus of lenders' arrears management policies today is on seeking realistic alternatives that balance the interests of customer and lender. </p> <p>\"Anyone who thinks they may be heading towards financial problems should contact their lender to discuss their options - the earlier the better.\"<br> Adam Sampson, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter described the figures as \"shocking\" and said the UK was \"inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis\".</p> <p>\"We know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment, and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head.\"</p> <h2>Emergency help</h2> <p>Yesterday the government announced it was expanding its scheme to provide emergency legal aid to borrowers threatened with repossession.</p> <p>Currently 154 courts around the country have government-funded advisers in place to offer free legal advice and representation to homeowners, regardless of their financial circumstances.</p> <p>That number is set to be boosted to 174 and there are more schemes in the pipeline, the government said.</p> <p>The housing minister, Caroline Flint, said: \"Whilst the rate of repossessions is not on the same scale as the early 90s, we want to ensure that the right support is in place for those who might need it now because of global economic pressures. </p> <p>\"That's why we are expanding free legal representation at county courts, which can make a real difference in ensuring that repossession is only ever used as a last resort.\"</p>",
  "<p>It may have taken him 15 years to produce just five movies, but Quentin Tarantino certainly isn't hanging about on new project Inglorious Bastards. Having already secured the services of the likes of Hostel director Eli Roth and The Office's BJ Novak to play two of his Nazi-hunting soldiers in what is likely to be QT's tribute to the Dirty Dozen movies, the film-maker has now signed Brad Pitt to the starring role. </p> <p>The Hollywood Reporter says Pitt will play Lt Aldo Raine, the maverick southern leader of a platoon of eight Jewish American soldiers who exact vengeance on the Nazi rulers of Vichy-era second world war France. </p> <p>Furthermore, Simon Pegg, who proved his action-comedy chops in Hot Fuzz, is also in talks to join the cast as a British lieutenant, while Nastassja Kinski is reportedly considering taking a role as a German actor. </p> <p>Pitt's character is said to be a soundbite-toting rebel in the vein of Pulp Fiction's Jules Winnfield, memorably played by Samuel L Jackson. The actor and Tarantino will work together as actor and director for the first time.</p> <p>Inglorious Bastards comes at an unusual period in Tarantino's career, as the director finds himself coming off the back of a major flop for the first time. His previous film, Death Proof, was released as part of the Grindhouse double-header in the US but severed from its partner in the UK and Europe after poor box office yields. It also suffered from lukewarm reviews. To put it another way, Tarantino badly needs a hit if he's to retain the gravitas to continue with his kitchsy brand of film-making.</p> <p>Early reports had suggested that bringing in Leonardo DiCaprio to star opposite Pitt as the film's chief villain, the German colonel Hans \"Jewhunter\" Landa, might help boost the film's box office credentials, but producer Lawrence Bender is now said to be looking for a German actor to take the role, so we're guessing that's now off the table.</p> <p>Inglorious Bastards is aiming to start shooting on October 13 in Germany, with a debut planned for the Cannes film festival in May: fast going by anyone's standards.</p>",
  "<p><br>The JesusPan. Photograph: PR</p> <p>There have for a long time been toasters that can burn your toast <a href=\"http://www.thisnext.com/item/0C7A9F51/Pop-Art-Toaster-with-6-Plates\">in pretty patterns</a>; even talk of hooking them up to wifi in order to produce toast with an accurate weather forecast branded on it, but it's always been quite difficult to ensure that the faces of major religious figures are burnt onto your breakfast - doubtless due to some crazy fear of religious reprisal - and that's always seemed like a gap in the market. But now we discover it is possible after all.</p> <p>And while there are an awful lot of novelty kitchen gadgets available out there, this has to count as our favourite piece of pointless tat this week. Until the next one comes along, of course. Can there be a more pointless kitchen implement in existence?</p> <p>Of course, this whole JesusPan thing poses another problem from the outset. Not for the faithful who want the mark of the messiah on to their eggy bread, or for the lovers of kitch who want ... well, the same - that lot are all happy. But what about religious figures wanting to <em>miraculously</em> appear in food? How will they maintain their miraculous renown now anyone can make their own holy toast?</p> <p>\"Holy Quesidilla!\" sounds like something the boy wonder might say, but it's also <a href=\"http://karlastories.blogspot.com/2006/02/face-of-jesus-in-my-quesadilla-yall.html\">something that happens</a> with, it would seem, alarming regularity, because the tradition of holy appearances in food is a longstanding one.

Can you swear that if you chopped open an aubergine, you would recognise the <a href=\"http://www.mcn.org/1/Miracles/Allah2.html\">Arabic word for Allah</a>?

  "<p>More than 3 billion people around the world are about to switch on their televisions to watch the opulent ceremony that will mark the official start of Beijing's Olympic Games. More than 80-odd world leaders - including Bush, Putin and Sarkozy - will be at the Bird's Nest stadium for the lavish event. In a bizarre semi-snub Gordon Brown is continuing his family holiday in Suffolk, although he will attend the closing ceremony.</p> <p>But as the performers strut their stuff and the fireworks explode how will it all be viewed in the web world? </p> <p>Around 1,000 Tibetan exiles marched on the Chinese consulate in Kathmandu and a banner-waving Brit was arrested in Hong Kong today but these events are of no concern to the China Daily website<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/\">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/</a>. Its headline says: \"Welcome to Beijing, World\", adding: \"There were cheers, and there was applause. It's Beijing's biggest day after seven years of wait.\" It tells us that the hot tip on who will light the Olympic flame at the opening ceremony - just minutes away - is gymnastics star Li Ning.</p> <p>Although the authorities have closed factories and pulled millions of cars off the road, smog and haze have enveloped the capital today, obscuring views of the futuristic skyline. Again, this is of little concern to China Daily which quotes the Olympic committee president Jacques Rogge, who advises that there is a difference between haze and air pollution. \"What you see is the result of humidity and heat,\" he says. \"It is not the same as pollution.\" </p> <p>The site's bloggers are excited about the opening. \"Today, the world will witness the greatest ever Olympic Games in world history. Love, peace, prosperity and progress for the world!\" says one. And tens of thousands of young people, the China Daily tells us, are so excited about the auspicious date of the Olympics that they are rushing to get married and have their babies today. Eight, eight, eight is considered lucky in its own right but the Olympics gives it added cachet. Sun Zhengbiao and Xue Jiaojiao got married this morning. Xue, who is also a volunteer for the Olympic games, will patrol her neighbourhood this evening night for security risks. \"I will probably miss some part of the opening ceremony but it's okay. I can watch the recast tomorrow.\"</p> <p>As the opening ceremony got underway this afternoon human rights groups and world leaders were continuing their attacks on China's human rights abuses. \"The Chinese government and the International Olympic Committee have had seven years to deliver on their pledges that these games would further human rights,\" said Sophie Richardson, Asia director for Human Rights Watch<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">http://www.hrw.org/</a>. \"Instead, the Beijing Games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in China's constitution and international law.\" </p> <p>And earlier even US president George Bush - who this week chose to make a critical speech on China from Thailand rather than in the communist nation itself - managed to use the opening of the new US embassy in Beijing to prod the Chinese authorities. China has rounded up dissidents ahead of the Olympics and imposed Internet restrictions on journalists, all contrary to Beijing's commitments when it won the right to host the games. \"Let people say what they think,\" said Bush, adding: \"We strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful.\"</p>",
  "<p>A TV station's news bulletin cuts to a clip of a picturesque green valley. As the camera pans across the landscape the news reader's voice can be heard in the background. Suddenly a white flash fills the screen and as the light subsides an ominous fiery mushroom cloud can be seen rising in the distance.</p> <p>Where are we? Can anyone tell me what country this is? Can anyone guess what's going on here?</p> <p>Learners are then handed a news article that explains all. The headline reads <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/04/artnews.art\">Artists spliced fake nuclear blast into TV weather news</a>. The text describes how a Czech art group managed to introduce footage of a fictitious atomic explosion into a live news programme broadcast on Czech TV last year. See the video clip <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzaN2x8qXcM\">here</a>.</p> <p>The aim, said the art group, was to question the truthfulness and credibility of the media, and the stunt gained them an award from the Czech National Gallery. A Czech judge was less impressed and fined three members of the group $10,000 when the case came to court this year.</p> <p>A news story like this could appeal to a wide range of learners. It may also serve as an effective springboard for the discussion and exploration of issues that relate to, among other things, art, law and the media. Its ability to do so, however, could depend on whether or not learners are given access to the video footage that lies at its heart.</p> <p>For the language teacher, it can pay to bring multimedia news coverage into the learning environment. By including, for example, the video clip of the bogus bomb as an ingredient of the lesson plan, we could ensure both optimised student engagement with the story and comprehension of the text. Thanks to the availability of this video clip and thousands of other news-related clips on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a>, this is now easy to do.</p> <p>In just three years YouTube has become the second most visited site on the internet, so it is not surprising that it is changing the way that video is used in the classroom. Part of this change may be driven by the learners themselves. On a recent forum discussion on the use of video-sharing sites in the language classroom, teacher Maribel Boender wrote: \"In our school we have a language centre in which all the students have access to internet and multimedia. One of the biggest problems is that they get totally distracted watching videos on YouTube. I try to take advantage of their motivation by using those clips for educational purposes.\"</p> <p>Such motivation has the potential to be transformed into learner autonomy. If learners have a computer with internet access at home they can revisit a video clip that has been used in class and reactivate the language that was taught in conjunction with it.</p> <p>For teachers who have online access in class, video sharing provides a powerful reference tool to enhance class discussions. Unlike standard television programmes, YouTube clips are restricted to no more than 10 minutes. The majority are much shorter, which is an additional advantage for time-starved teachers.</p> <p>Teachers who do not have access to the internet in class can still use clips with their students. Clips can be downloaded to CD-Rom disks or memory sticks and played on computers in class or they can be viewed on MP3 players and mobile phones.</p> <p>Because of its popularity, YouTube has become a vast repository of notorious TV moments, from news footage \u2013 both current and historic \u2013 to advertising campaigns. Last year an advertisement for Cadbury's chocolate featuring a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnzFRV1LwIo\">drum-playing gorilla</a> turned into a global viral marketing phenomenon when it was viewed on the internet by millions of online users. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdxqIBfEAw\">We are sinking</a> commercial for the Berlitz language schools chain had more modest success but is still very popular. In it a young German coastguard is unable to avert disaster as a result of a pronunciation problem and it always seems to go down well with my learners.</p> <p>Many clips have become the focus of articles and online discussion or have earned their own entries on Wikipedia (see below). The combination of the original clip and these related texts can serve as a springboard for reading activities. Then there is the musical factor. Teachers have long known the value of using pop songs in English as way of motivating young learners and now they can enhance lessons based on song lyrics by viewing the music videos of their students' favourite artists.</p> <p>Finally, the success of YouTube has ushered in the \"broadcast yourself\" era, as people post homemade clips on video sharing sites. So the next step is to encourage your students to create and upload their own collaborative classroom work. For inspiration, type <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a96TmrxZRXY\">Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar</a> into the YouTube search window and watch a captivating three-minute performance by a small group of Korean children and their teacher. Isn't it about time your school got itself a new camcorder?</p> <p><strong>Video clips with lessons to teach</strong><br>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5evS-ApSNQ\">Guy Goma</a> incident is a good example of a video clip creating news. This business studies graduate went for a job interview at the BBC's studios in London, but as a result of a mix-up, he found himself being interviewed live on a news bulletin. The full story, which is available at the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4774429.stm\">BBC website</a>, could be summarised and used for the basis of a group writing activity followed by a class viewing of the famous clip.</p> <p>Or how about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU8DDYz68kM\">Battle at Kruger</a>, the most-viewed video clip in YouTube's \"Pets and Animals\" category? Like many viral videos, this one has its own entry on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_at_Kruger\">Wikipedia</a>. After watching the clip of a confrontation between a herd of buffalo and a pride of lions, students could attempt to write an account of it before comparing their work with the language of the Wikipedia entry.</p> <p>\u2022 Jamie Keddie is a teacher and trainer in Spain.

  "<p>Georgia today said three Russian jets had entered its airspace and dropped bombs at two locations just south of a rebel enclave in the breakaway region of South Ossetia.</p> <p>The announcement came as Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin, who is in China to attend the opening of the Olympic games, said that \"aggressive\" action by Georgia would incur a \"response\" from Russia.</p> <p>A Georgian interior ministry spokesman, Shota Utiashvili, said two Russian military planes had attacked a police station near the town of Kareli, and a third dropped a bomb near the border town of Gori. Several civilians had been wounded in Kareli, he said.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who has ordered the mobilisation of reservists, was quoted by Reuters as saying \"the greater part\" of South Ossetia had been liberated.</p> <p>Russia's Interfax news agency said Georgian troops had entered the separatist South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali, a claim denied by Georgia.</p> <p>Interfax quoted its correspondent on the ground as saying heavy fighting was raging in the south of the town, but Utiashvili said the information was \"not correct\".</p> <p>Rather, he said, Georgian forces were engaged in a battle with two convoys of trucks that had entered South Ossetia from Russia and were trying to reach the breakaway capital.</p> <p>\"We want to give time to the remaining civilians to leave Tskhinvali, \" he said, adding that Georgian forces would enter the capital \"if the need arises\".</p> <p>South Ossetia's leader, Eduard Kokoity, said his own troops were still in control of the capital.</p> <p>\"We are in full control of the capital city. Fighting is on the city limits, \" he told Interfax.</p> <p>Georgian television said Georgian troops had taken eight South Ossetian villages, including Sarabuk, a strategic vantage point on high ground.</p> <p>Whatever the precise battle details, it was clear that a serious conflict had broken out only hours after President Saakashvili promised a unilateral Georgian ceasefire and offered South Ossetia the chance of broad autonomy within Georgia. The number of casualties was unclear but likely to be high.</p> <p>All eyes were on Russia and its peacekeeping contingent in the area, which Georgia accuses of supporting the separatists. The Russian peacekeepers said the Georgians were targeting their positions and they had lost some men. In Moscow, Russia's security council was due to meet in an emergency session today.</p> <p>The crisis in the Caucasus represents the first major test for Russia's new president, Dmitry Medvedev, but Putin's comments from China showed that he may be the man who still really calls the shots.</p> <p>Georgian forces appear to have the upper hand and the element of surprise at the moment but they could soon find themselves fighting on two fronts, as another separatist region, the Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia, announced its troops were moving towards the Georgian border. Cossaks from Russia said they were also ready to go to the aid of the South Ossetians, many of whom have Russian citizenship.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali, Kokoity was meeting Teymuraz Mamsurov, the leader of North Ossetia, which is just over the border in Russia. The North Ossetians have also promised help to their South Ossetian brethren. </p> <p>Mamsurov said a convoy of lorries carrying humanitarian aid from his region was attacked by Georgian war planes during the night.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Fearon is an effusive, vocal individual. What's more, he's created a game that's perfectly safe for work, but has an unfortunately NSFW title: <a href=\"http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/rm5-war-twat/\">WarTwat</a>. Call it a comment on today's society, a reaction to the contemporary trends in gaming, or perhaps call it an indie game. I asked Robert (aka Oddbod) about his game, and why - regardless of its name - it's received accolades from many of the industry's shining stars.</p> <p>There are naughty words in full after the fold.</p> <p><strong>Explain your game to my mum in 140 words.</strong> I'm not sure if I should be attempting to explain this to your mum.</p> <p>I mean, what if she's got a dicky heart? Perhaps her eyesight is failing? There's so many what if's that I wouldn't want to be responsible for hospitalising the woman. What if she's a prude? It's called War Twat after all. She might find that really offensive.</p> <p>I can't really answer that without knowing more about your mother, but on the off chance that she's not a prude or not suffering from some health condition that could result in me having to deal with the consequences of someone dying after playing my game - it's a game where you shoot things and get shot at a lot. It also has graphics designed by a 4 year old. It's got handbags, diggers and double decker buses with lasers.</p> <p><strong>How do players control the game?</strong> There's only 4 directions and fire, so a keyboard or a joypad will suffice. There's no rocket science here. Move the ship, shoot stuff, don't get shot.</p> <p><strong>What is your background?</strong> Binman, office muppet, store manager, general grunt, person who swears at faded rock stars for stealing stuff from support bands, trained studio engineer and person who did some tap dancing training by accident but has now thankfully forgotten how to move his feet in a straight line, never mind dance. Now retired and spending my time being a full time carer for the good lady wife, a small child and a black kitten from Bolton who attempts to punch half the other cats in the neighbourhood. He was never cut out for suburbia. Neither am I, really.</p> <p>I also run a few web sites about indie games (<a href=\"http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/\">RetroRemakes</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.merseyremakes.co.uk/gibber/\">MerseyRemakes</a>). Some good, some not so good. And the web sites.</p> <p><strong>Name your competitors.</strong> In all seriousness, I have none. Cactus is the only guy I can think of who does similar stuff, but he's not competition - he's just awesome. Perhaps the guys who may have been responsible for Polybius if it really existed?</p> <p><strong>How many players do you have now and what's your target in 12 months?</strong> At last count 9,000ish people had attempted to play <a href=\"http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/rm5-war-twat/\">War Twat</a>. I'd estimate that approximately 20% of these are now scarred for life, a further 30% booking appointments at the opticians and the remaining 50% wondering why they bothered.</p> <p>In 12 months time? I dunno, can't say I care too much about the numbers, just one person playing and enjoying the game is fantastic.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest challenge?</strong> I had a specific goal in mind when writing <a href=\"http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/rm5-war-twat/\">War Twat</a>. It's a reactionary game at its heart.</p> <p>I got tired of the huge amounts of assets that games now require, the ever increasing complexities of control systems, the shoehorning of story lines into games that quite clearly don't need them, the casualisation of games that mistake lowest common denominator for accessibility, the games as art set crapping out conceptual rubbish that means nothing to anyone but a minute subset of people who really want to believe this stuff... Warren Zevon once said \"The purpose of art is not to educate. The purpose of art is not to proselytize or sway the vote. There's something else for that, and that's fine, but it's not art. Not fine art. The purpose of fine art is to say, 'Gee, this planet's not so bad. Look at this nonsense the human race is coming up with' \". Man, I can't disagree with that.</p> <p>The biggest challenge for <a href=\"http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/rm5-war-twat/\">War Twat</a> was writing something that embodied everything I care about. Something that takes all the visual elements I love and have loved and runs with them to the extreme. I was creating something that can never be anything other than a game. There's no hidden subtext, nothing metatextual about it. You can't write a thesis or artists statement about it. It can't in a million years be mistaken for a mainstream title. It is, for all its brutality, pick up and play, quick to restart and easy to understand. It had to be tough, nasty and unfair but it had to be damn fun to boot. It had to be, to all intents and purposes, a game.</p> <p>That was the biggest challenge and without blowing my own trumpet too much, I think I achieved what I set out to do.</p> <p><strong>What's the weirdest development experience you've had so far?</strong> Aside from trying to ask a 4 year old child what he'd like to see in the game you mean? Well, probably being asked by a fine Scottish hardcore band to produce a special edition for them with custom graphics and their music playing over the game.</p> <p>Not what I expected, but I'm more than happy to oblige until Luke Haines or Pete Wylie ask me to write a game...</p> <p><strong>What's your distribution/publishing plan?</strong> I wish I had one. <a href=\"http://www.retroremakes.com/wordpress/rm5-war-twat/\">War Twat</a> is free to download and free to play. It's sort of donationware but without the heavy hard sell. I'd sooner people get to play and enjoy the games than cough up cash.</p> <p>I'd like the time to work on an XNA version of the game or be able to invest in some sort of console port, but just too much to do in life right now and money is short. Mind you, if someone offered to port it and the terms were favourable enough...</p> <p><strong>Are Indie games the latest killer app?</strong> God no. I don't see how you can possibly say that. It's not like all indie developers are pushing in the same direction or anything. There's so many things that come out of the indie scene from cookie cutter hidden object games to art terrorism that it's rude to bundle them all together like they're some sort of gestalt entity. A rubbish game is a rubbish game no matter where it originates and there's rubbish games in the Indie scene just as there are in the mainstream. There's also lots and lots and lots of really great games spanning a ruck of genres and styles too and given anyone can be \"indie\", we've certainly got the weight of numbers in our favour compared to the mainstream industry.</p> <p>Yet, there's innovation everywhere if you know where to look, but perhaps yes, maybe the race for graphical fidelity, multi million mega dollar budgets and ever increasing hardware specs is reaching the end of its natural life and that's where indies have the advantage. We generally don't have the budget to compete on that sort of level so we have to make the games speak for themselves. In theory, at least. Like everything in life, it doesn't always quite pan out that way.</p> <p>The mainstream industry sort of knows what to do, but I can't help but think the bean counters haven't got their heads around it yet. Maybe once we get past the casual shovelware boom we'll see where the land lies.</p> <p>It's not like bedroom development is a new thing either, certainly when I was growing up it was the norm for one spotty kid in his room to bang out the next big thing. Perhaps we're not the latest killer app, just reclaiming our rightful heritage?</p> <p>Heck, I dunno. I'm just some guy on the internet who makes games and swears a lot. I just see everything as games, no matter where they come from. Edge reviewing Noitu Love 2 alongside the other titles with absolutely no distinction is the best step in the right direction we've had in ages. More like that please, less killer app more killer game talk, regardless of origin.</p> <p><strong>Are you the next big thing?</strong> I'm me. I'm happy with that. I don't know what the future holds but as long as I'm happy and the people I care about and love are happy, I'll settle for whatever life throws at me. If that's being the next big thing, so be it. If it's not, I'm sure I'll live. I can't quite see it somehow though, not unless the universe turns inside itself and the entire fabric of reality bends around me.</p> <p>Mind you, it'd be nice to see enough cash to not have to worry about the next set of bills that land someday, so if anyone really wants to elevate me to \"next big thing\", if it pays, I'm in!</p>",
  "<p><br>'An utterly cynical venture' ... Spooks: Code 9. Photograph: Kudos/BBC</p> <p>As spin-offs go, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/spookscode9/\">Spooks: Code 9</a> is ropey indeed. I can't quite decide what's most irritating - the clunky, lazy writing, the fact that they all live in a house together, the random relocation to Leeds, an insistence on making the female spies dance suggestively in club scenes, the dreadful haircut sported by Georgia Moffet, or a combination of all of the above. But whatever it is, Spooks Code 9 is an utterly cynical venture and a damning indictment of the lack of imagination at work in commissioning new drama. (BBC3 will commission <em>this</em> twaddle but not the genuinely intriguing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jFjLyOCFWc\">The Things I Haven't Told You</a>. You go figure, because I'm close to giving up.)</p> <p>Moreover, given its patronising awfulness, SC9 actually damages the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/games/index.shtml\">Spooks</a> brand. And that's what it's about - the brand. Increasingly in drama, it seems to be all about how a drama can be marketed. And boy, does that suck.</p> <p>So in the spirit of brand extension and targeting demographics, pitch me your ideas for the most preposterous spin-offs you can think of. I've lately wondered why they don't do a Young Miss Marple. Presumably the keepers of the Agatha Christie flame are against such things, otherwise it would have happened already. It couldn't possibly be ropier/hammier/more irksome than the current Marples. (Sorry, <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/Drama/classiccrime/Marple/MissMarpleNews/WhyDidntTheyAskEvans/default.html\">Agatha Christie's Marple</a>. As opposed to anyone else's, one presumes.)</p> <p>So how about Law Student John Deed? Or a drama about the old dogs of New Tricks as young pups? Secret Diary of a Rent Boy? B&amp;B Babylon? Actually, as <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/18512/makers-of-bbcs-hotel-babylon-to-adapt\">Fashion Babylon</a> is apparently on its way, perhaps we shouldn't joke about that last one.</p>",
  "<p>What happens when you cross \"hot\" Paris Hilton running for president with trees and leaves getting their freak on for Greenpeace and a bit of a spoof of Heath Ledger and Christian Bale?</p> <p>You get this week's Viral Video chart, that's what.</p> <p>First up a tear jerker.
