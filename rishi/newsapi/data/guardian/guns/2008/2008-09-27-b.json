  "<p>This time last year, France was pondering the rise of rugby and the possibility that it might overtake football. Rugby was deemed family-friendly and, if what happened on the field was sometimes incomprehensible, the image of players belting lumps out of each other and then embracing at the end struck an attractive chord.</p> <p>Football's inclusiveness, meanwhile, was threatened - in Paris in particular - by the racists and political extremists who ganged up in the stadiums. Petulance ruled on the field. With France's Rugby World Cup just about to begin, this was a golden opportunity to give football a good kicking.</p> <p>It never quite happened. The crowds flocked to the RWC fixtures from start to finish, but for the rugby revolution to succeed, the French team had to play their part. They finished fourth, losing twice to Argentina, and in the semi-final to England, of all people, in Paris, of all places. </p> <p>In the Six Nations that followed the World Cup, France, now under new coach Marc Li\u00e8vremont, flickered brilliantly and then flopped. The assault on the great god, Football, had stalled. </p> <p>In England, one month into a new rugby season, it may be overzealous to suggest that a new charge is underway. Football fills our pages first, the dominant force in this medium, as in all other media. And yet rugby comes ever more warmly wrapped in wholesomeness, its traditional match-day welcome complemented by a commercial attention to good service. </p> <p>It may be worth pointing out, on that money-making front, that rugby clubs that own their grounds have a material advantage over those that ground-share. Worcester, for example, are better off at Sixways, a purpose-built home on the edge of their city and right by the M5, than Saracens at Watford FC, an arrangement that still feels like an exile. </p> <p>Harlequins are more secure, and not just currently in the Premiership, than the reigning champions, Wasps. The Stoop is a rugby destination; Adams Park is a rented space at the end of an industrial park in High Wycombe, whose very name makes a slight mockery of the London before Wasps. </p> <p>No matter; it's all relative, since there are opportunities galore for all the contestants in an ambitious sport, even in these days of credit crunch. In fact, you could say that rugby offers relatively cheap relief from the pains of real life, or the costs of following football. </p> <p>This being rugby, there must be a but. It comes not so much in the form of the experimental law variations - called 'global ELVs', although they are peculiar to our hemisphere at the moment - as in the 'protocols' from the International Rugby Board. These were reminders to referees to apply the letter of the law at the breakdown, or the post-tackle situation, as I think they prefer to call the scramble for the ball after contact. </p> <p>Basically, the dictate was to keep everybody on their feet, entering through the correct portal and binding to a team-mate. Clearing out, for the sake of inflicting maximum damage on an opponent, was forbidden. </p> <p>Well, the Premiership hasn't cracked the protocol yet. September has been dominated by a kicking game that at least prevents the ball from going into the tackle area, where anybody can be -and is being - penalised.</p> <p>The ELVs were developed, painstakingly, as a result of the way England played in order to win the World Cup of 2003. That's a long time ago. At the same time as the ELV trials were taking place at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, however, a universal process of accelerated evolution was launched. The England of 2003 were admired, but it was time to move on.</p> <p>By 2005, the Lions, built by Sir Clive Woodward on an England model, looked antiquated. Wales had already won the grand slam that year with a much more adventurous game. Without any prompting from the IRB, the game was self-adjusting. </p> <p>But the die had been cast. Along came the ELVs and with them all the danger of schism. New Zealand and Australia, historically much more adventurous in their acceptance of rapid change, saw only good in the 'hybrid' laws that governed the last Super 14 and Tri Nations.</p> <p>Europe, by tradition far more cautious, opted out of the law that replaced penalties for all bar the most serious offences with free-kicks, and settled for the 'global' set. Reluctant already to believe that the laws were forged to encourage open play, England found themselves suddenly in the grip of a double whammy of doubt, the protocols arriving at the same time as the ELVs.</p> <p>Rugby is basking off the field in an Indian summer of success around the clubs. There is a load to look forward to, from the Heineken Cup to the November internationals, but on the field there is concern, irritation even - a set-to between coaches Dean Richards of Harlequins and Dean Ryan of Gloucester would be worth paying an old-style banker's bonus to see - as harsh reality grapples with good intention. </p> <p>The ELVs were unnecessary; the protocols a decree too far. But we're stuck with them and the last thing rugby needs is for its practitioners, its entertainment arm, to try to unpick a knot tied by dogmatic hands in Dublin, scout hut of the IRB.</p> <p>The coaches will find a way through and the players will adapt. Until they do, we may have to place the rugby revolution on hold. Gone for a rethink. Can't catch football yet. Back in five.</p>",
  "<p>New landlords will have to show their tenants a certificate rating the energy efficiency of their property from Wednesday. Energy performance certificates, or EPCs, are already a mandatory part of the Home Information Pack provided by anyone selling a home but, from 1 October, the certificate must also be available for prospective tenants to review. Existing landlords who are starting a new tenancy will also need to provide an EPC for review.</p> <p>The EPC will give the property an energy rating on a scale from A to G, with A the most efficient. The certificate will also contain recommendations to improve the property's energy efficiency, costs of the recommendations, typical savings per year and an estimated performance rating after improvement. Landlords are under no obligation to carry out any of the improvements.</p> <p>Although the number of people renting properties has increased by 20 per cent in the last three months, the majority of landlords still haven't obtained an EPC for their property ahead of the deadline, says John Heron, managing director of buy-to-let specialist Paragon Mortgages, which is advising landlords to get their EPCs as quickly as possible.</p> <p>EPCs cost from \u00a350 to \u00a3150, depending on the firm carrying out the energy assessment. Failure to comply with the legislation could result in a \u00a3200 fine.</p> <p>Landmark Information Group (<a href=\"http://www.hcrregister.com/searchassessor.html\">hcrregister.com/searchassessor.html</a>) has a list of accredited energy assessors.</p> <p><strong>Fashion stores increase interest on cards </strong></p> <p>Interest rates on store cards are rising, making it even more important for store cardholders to pay off their balances on time. Fashion chains Karen Millen and Oasis have both raised the interest rates on their cards from 24.9 per cent to 28.9 per cent, while Principles has gone from 24.6 per cent to 28.9 per cent. They have also cut the minimum payment required each month from 4 per cent of the outstanding balance to 3.65 per cent.</p> <p>'Some people might think it's brilliant that their minimum payment has been cut, as they could pay less each month, but [doing that] could cost you a lot of money in interest and it will take you far longer to pay off,' says Michelle Slade, analyst at price comparison site Moneyfacts.co.uk. While many retailers offer discounts to those taking out a store card, Slade warns that shoppers should think twice before signing up.</p> <p><strong>Cheap international calls on new free Sims</strong></p> <p>A new pay-as-you-go Sim card is promising to help mobile phone users cut their bills by offering reduced rates on international calls. Lycamobile Sim cards can be slotted into an existing mobile handset when the user needs to make an international call, with costs starting at around 4p a minute.</p> <p>The Sim card comes free when you purchase your phone credit. Users can top up by \u00a35, \u00a310 or \u00a315 online at <a href=\"http://www.lycamobile.co.uk\">lycamobile.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Last week telecoms regulators in Brussels, who first cut the cost of international calls last summer, also moved against 'rip-off' text charges. The cost of sending an SMS for consumers on holiday or travelling abroad for business will fall by 60 per cent, from a European average of 23p to 9p.</p> <p>The EU's top telecoms official, Viviane Reding, said she was putting the new rules forward because mobile-telephone companies had not responded to her call for them to lower the roaming charges for sending or receiving text messages outside a user's home nation.</p> <p><strong>Overdraft warning for pushy parents</strong></p> <p>Parents are being warned not to stray too far into their overdrafts to fund their children's expectations.</p> <p>According to the latest NS&amp;I savings survey, parents are putting their financial priorities on the back burner so that their children can get ahead. Nearly 30 per cent of parents are going into their overdrafts, taking out a loan or using credit cards because they don't want their children to miss out on the 'best opportunities', such as music and sports lessons, cultural trips or extra tuition. Meanwhile, over 76 per cent have cut down on socialising and over 50 per cent work longer hours to earn more money for their family.</p> <p>Tim Mack, senior savings spokesman at NS&amp;I, says parents need to budget and prioritise to stay in control when contemplating spending on the kids.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 5 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below we said that for eligibility under the FSCS compensation scheme, HSBC and First Direct are 'part of the same group' but are 'covered separately'. This is incorrect: they operate on the same banking licence so are not treated as individual institutions. We also said when Alliance &amp; Leicester is taken over by Santander, 'Abbey, Cahoot and Cater Allen are all authorised by the Spanish bank and they all operate under one UK licence'. We should clarify that Cahoot will operate under Abbey's banking licence and Cater Allen and pensions specialist James Hay operate on Cater Allen's licence. Alliance &amp; Leicester will retain its own licence. This has been corrected. </p> <p> </p> <p>Savers have been rushing to move money between accounts in the last week, fearing that their nest egg might not be protected if their bank or building society were to collapse.</p> <p>Cash has been inundated with requests from readers asking for more detail on which savings providers share banking licences, a fact crucial to protecting their money.</p> <p>If a bank or building society fails, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protects savers' money up to \u00a335,000. The protection is 'per person per bank', which means this limit applies to the total savings that someone holds with all institutions operating under the same banking licence.</p> <p>Confusion is created, however, because some savings providers that are owned by the same parent bank have their own banking licences, while others share that licence. The Q&amp;A panel aims to provide more detailed information to help allay savers' fears.</p> <p>Savers should be able to rest even easier soon, however, as the compensation limit is expected to increase to \u00a350,000. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is meant to be kicking off a 12-week consultation with banks and other stakeholders on this proposal shortly, but the government is keen for it to happen sooner rather than later.</p> <p>'The lead option in this consultation is to increase protection to \u00a350,000 of savings. This idea could be pushed through without consultation or legislation. It would simply be a matter of changing one figure for another,' says an FSA spokesman.</p> <p>Pressure on the FSA to act increased last week when its counterpart in Ireland increased the statutory limit for the Irish deposit protection scheme for banks and building societies from \u20ac20,000 (just over \u00a315,000) to \u20ac100,000 (\u20ac79,000). This increased protection will affect some savers in the UK, as it applies to the Post Office's instant saver account and its growth bonds range, which are provided by the Bank of Ireland, as well as accounts held with Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>Savings rates could also go up in the wake of the latest financial turmoil. When the credit crunch first hit, many providers turned to increasing the rates on their savings accounts as a means to draw in deposits, in response to the money markets drying up. Experts say it is possible that the same could happen again. Some providers have already launched new accounts paying high interest.</p> <p>The AA, whose savings range is part of the HBOS group, has just launched one of the highest paying one-year fixed-rate bonds currently available on the market \u2013 7.21 per cent on a minimum deposit of \u00a3500 \u2013 just beating the previous leading best-buy from ICICI, which pays 7.2 per cent. NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland were among the first, introducing new fixed-rate Isas paying up to 7.32 per cent and 7.25 per cent respectively. But you have to have savings of more than \u00a320,000 to benefit from these rates.</p> <p>Andrew Hagger, from price comparison website Moneynet, says: 'The more you have in savings, the more interest you will earn. Those people with savings nearer to the FSCS amount of \u00a335,000 might be the ones who consider transferring savings between providers rather than keeping it in one place. If you have sums of over \u00a320,000 because you have built up all your previous years' Isa allowances, then it's certainly worth considering one of these two accounts.'</p> <p>Barclays has also launched a new nine-month, fixed-rate bond, paying 6.3 per cent on a minimum deposit of \u00a35,000. 'This is a reasonable rate of interest, but there are other providers that offer higher on the same length term,' says Hagger, who recommends Anglo Irish Bank's nine-month bond, which pays 7.06 per cent.</p> <p>Both NS&amp;I and Northern Rock say they are seeing growing levels of deposits as some customers feel that their money is safer in the government-backed institutions, but the savings rates are not particularly high at either. NS&amp;I's easy access savings account pays a tiered level of interest from 1.85 per cent (on a minimum of \u00a3100 deposit) and 4.4 per cent on balances over \u00a350,000, while Northern Rock's esaver pays 5.75 per cent interest (minimum \u00a31 deposit).</p> <p>Michelle Slade, analyst at Moneyfacts.co.uk, says: 'Considering your money is protected with any institution up until \u00a335,000 under the FSCS anyway, you would do better to spread your money out if you have large savings, rather than put it all in a low-interest account with a government-owned bank.'</p> <h2>Q&amp;A</h2> <p><strong>Which banks operate under the HBOS banking licence? </strong><br>The HBOS group includes Halifax, the Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires and Intelligent Finance. Birmingham Midshires also provides savings accounts for Saga and the AA. So if in the event of HBOS going bust, someone who had \u00a335,000 in a Halifax account, \u00a335,000 in a Birmingham Midshires account and \u00a335,000 in an AA account, would only get \u00a335,000 protected.</p> <p><strong>What about Sainsbury's?</strong><br>Sainsbury's Bank is half-owned by HBOS, but it has its own banking licence. So if you have \u00a335,000 in a Halifax account and \u00a335,000 in a Sainsbury's account, you would be covered separately for both sets of money. </p> <p><strong>What happens when Lloyds TSB takes over HBOS?</strong><br>Lloyds TSB and HBOS now have separate banking licences, but it is too soon to tell what will happen after the takeover. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society falls under the Lloyds TSB banking licence \u2013 so if you have \u00a335,000 in a C&amp;G account and \u00a335,000 in Lloyds TSB, you would only be covered for one of these sums under the FSCS. <br><strong><br>... and when Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley's savings business is taken over by Santander?</strong><br>Cahoot and Bradford &amp; Bingley will operate under Abbey's banking licence, and the private bank Cater Allen and pensions specialist James Hay operate on Cater Allen's licence. Alliance &amp; Leicester will retain its own licence despite becoming part of Santander.<br><strong><br>Which banks are part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group?</strong><br>Natwest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco Personal Finance and private bank Coutts are all part of the big RBS group, but each one carries its own banking licence. Direct Line, however, shares its authorisation with RBS, so if you have more than \u00a335,000 in a Direct Line Isa and an RBS account, you would only be covered for the first \u00a335,000.<br><strong><br>Which other banks share a licence?</strong><br>Yorkshire bank and Clydesdale bank share the same licence, as do the Co-operative bank and Smile, as do Barclays and Woolwich. Egg and Citibank are part of Citigroup, but both are considered as individual institutions under the FSCS. HSBC and First Direct are also part of the same group and operate on the same licence so are not treated as individual institutions under the FSCS. Nationwide is taking over the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies, which will share Nationwide's authorisation.</p>",
  "<p>In a small square in Salvador a newly arrived foreigner, Gringa, plants seeds of ambition in the hearts and minds of local residents. Bahia Blues plunges the reader into the internal monologues of a vibrant cast of characters as they are faced with the violence of favela life in Rio de Janeiro, the metropolitan anonymity of S\u00e3o Paulo and finally, the brutality of the high-security prison of Canju. It is all too easy to make comparisons between Yasmina Traboulsi's lyrically translated debut and City of God but, unlike the film, this novel avoids glamourising the lives of those caught up in drug- and gun-fuelled favela life. The lives and deaths are all too imaginable and the violence leaps off the page, bringing a gritty realism to an otherwise other worldly account of TV soap-inspired dreams.</p>",
  "<p>It's 1998 and I'm trying to interview Anna Kournikova. It's a bit like attempting to secure an audience with a world leader, which, Kournikova's handlers would have you believe, she is. Billed as 'the most downloaded female on the planet', she is flanked by a battalion of handlers, agents, managers and other assorted obstructionists.</p> <p>There are months of delays and unreturned calls. When I am favoured with the courtesy of a response, the communication is annoying in the extreme. Can you send questions in advance? Can you embed references to the products of Anna's sponsors in whatever you write? That would really help speed the process! Finally, after more than a year, I am granted a 10-minute session at a hotel in New Jersey where Kournikova is being paid a prince(ss)ly fee to play in a weekend tennis exhibition. Monitored by yet another handler, she spends the excruciating session chomping on pink gum, staring at her nails, and performing a nimble feat of dialogue by giving yes/no answers to questions that begin with the word 'how'.</p> <p>It's 2008 and I'm trying to interview Anna Kournikova. Half an hour before the meeting, my mobile chirps. I steel myself for a call apologising for a last-minute change of plans. But, no, it's Anna - on an unblocked number - confirming that she is running on schedule and if I'm having trouble finding a parking space at the Starbucks where we are scheduled to meet, I can always park at the adjacent Whole Foods. She arrives alone, pulling up in a tasteful but hardly ostentatious car. She makes eye contact. She chews no gum. Ninety minutes into what is more a conversation than an interview, she is still going strong. No, I'm forced to admit, I have not read the book Eat, Pray, Love. 'You really should,' she says. 'It's spiritual, but well written at the same time.'</p> <p>She's 27 now and, while she pretty much looks the same, Anna Kournikova bears only the vaguest resemblance to the one-woman international conglomerate that damn near hijacked women's tennis a decade ago. While she is unwilling to concede that she has retired, she has not played a WTA Tour match in more than five years. The regal prom queen who once remarked to a suitor, 'You can't afford me,' is now recommending literature. The tennis mercenary who allegedly made $50m in off-court income before the age of 18 is now an ambassador for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America - which sounds like so much PR until you learn that in April she went to gritty Tijuana, Mexico, to help open a youth facility.</p> <p>When it's pointed out how little the Kournikova of today conforms to the image she created years ago, she nods her head so forcefully her Gucci sunglasses nearly fly off her face. 'Of course I'm a different person! People say, \"I can't believe how much you've changed!\" What did they expect? People grow, evolve. It would be sad if I didn't change!'</p> <p>Kournikova is now a Ripo - Russian in passport only. She holds a green card and lives full-time in Miami Beach, the port she entered in 1992, when she was a 10-year-old prodigy armed with talent and attitude in equal measure. 'When Anna won a point, it wasn't an achievement,' recalls Nick Bollettieri, her first American coach. 'That was how it was supposed to go. I mean, she was Anna Kournikova.' At 14 she won the Orange Bowl, the top international junior event. In 1997, aged 16, she lost in the semi-finals at Wimbledon to Martina Hingis. The next year, she beat Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Steffi Graf, reached the fourth round of the US and French Opens, and cracked the top 20. Anna Inc. was open for business.</p> <p>The Kournikova phenomenon was a classic case of harmonic convergence. Women's sports - tennis in particular - were growing in popularity, eyed as a promising frontier by sports marketers. The internet enabled fans from Minsk to Minneapolis to access Kournikova in a way they never could, say, Chris Evert. As the global economy kicked in, you could scarcely find a more ideal exponent for it than an exotic Russian who spoke flawless English and performed all over the world.</p> <p>Kournikova embraced it all. A daughter of communism (she was born in Moscow in 1981) took commercialism to new extremes. She endorsed products from watches to brokerage firms to sports bras, virtually every campaign built around her looks rather than her athletic prowess. When she was not pushing products, she was striking come-hither poses for magazines. The pundits could debate whether this was a feminist setback or a feminist triumph. 'What is she supposed to say, \"No, I don't want your money?\" That's like winning the lottery and then saying, \"No, I don't really deserve it,\"' no less than Martina Navratilova once said of Kournikova. Meanwhile, Kournikova was making bundles of cash for her sponsors, her tour, her agents and, not least, herself. Nathalie Tauziat, a higher-ranked but less publicised WTA player at the time, called Kournikova 'a blonde windfall'.</p> <p>But Kournikova's cult of personality exacted a price on her tennis. While the contagion known as Annamania raged and hormonally charged boys showed up en masse at women's tennis matches, an inconvenient truth persisted: Kournikova had never won a singles tournament. Pitted against the hype, her ability had little chance. Distraction was her destruction. In the retelling, Kournikova was the tennis equivalent of the NFL's William 'The Fridge' Perry, a unique physical specimen rather than a creditable athlete. </p> <p>In truth - and this is what gives the story a slightly tragic ring - Kournikova was abundantly gifted. She played whimsical, well rounded tennis and excelled at the net, an area of the court most contemporary players avoid as if it were quicksand. She reached as high as eighth in the singles rankings and in 1999 was the world's top doubles player. But the weight of never having won a title ultimately crushed her. 'I put pressure on myself, especially as I got older,' she says. 'At 16, 17 you have no fear. You don't think or analyse. You just play on automatic. You can get smarter as you get older, but in sports you can be too smart, you know?'</p> <p>Her fragile psyche was compounded by a fragile body. Foot, back and ankle injuries forestalled her career. By the spring of 2003 she was playing low-level events in an attempt to revive her game. That May she withdrew from a match against a 16-year-old arriviste named Maria Sharapova. The following week in Charlottesville, Virginia, she lost to a Brazilian ranked outside the top 300 and has not played a sanctioned match since.</p> <p>Her impact went beyond internet photo galleries. Following the trail blazed at least in part by Kournikova, there are five players in the WTA's top 10 from Russia or the former Soviet Union. 'Anna,' says seventh-ranked Svetlana Kuznetsova, 'showed there was possibility through tennis.' As playing careers go, however, Kournikova's is a case of sizzle beating steak, in straight sets.</p> <p>In assessing her record, Kournikova speaks with such candour and detachment that it's almost as if she is describing another person. 'In a perfect world, would I have won a tournament? Yes. But I wasn't able to string those matches together. Sometimes I got unlucky, and sometimes I just lost.' Regrets? 'Not a thing. Except to be a little stronger physically. Come on, regrets? I grew up a little girl in the Soviet Union playing at a small sports club. Tennis gave me my life.' Does she wish she had reined in the hype machine? 'It's hard. We did the best we could. But there was no blueprint.' And whatever you do, don't lavish her with a shred of sympathy. 'Hey, I took the money. It's simple. If you don't want the attention, don't take the money.'</p> <p>Tennis rivals boxing in the frequency of comebacks, so don't be surprised if Kournikova joins the ranks of the 'unretired'. She works out daily and this spring ran four miles in just under 29 minutes in a charity triathlon in Miami. Though her hands are noticeably free of calluses, she plays tennis a few times a week, sometimes on public courts not far from her waterfront home. In July she played in two matches for the St Louis Aces in the World Team Tennis league. 'Honestly, who knows?' she says. 'I'm young enough to still play. But physically could I take it?'</p> <p>She spends her days living what she admits is a charmed existence. Her parents, Alla and Sergei, divorced in 2004, but Alla moved to Palm Beach, remarried and has a three-year-old son, whose half-sister is all too happy to babysit. 'I get my kid fix,' she says. 'Then I say, \"Here ya go, Mom. See ya.\"' Kournikova is a spokesperson for sports shoe firm K-Swiss. She reads. When the urge strikes, she hits the South Beach clubs. And there are those Boys and Girls Club fundraisers. 'Don't get the wrong idea,' she says. 'I basically get dressed up and beg people for money.'</p> <p>She still has run-ins with the paparazzi, particularly when out with her longtime boyfriend, singer Enrique Iglesias. 'Girls look at him. Guys look at me,' she says. 'It goes with the job, but it gets annoying when you feel violated. Just take the picture and be done.' She can still watch celebrity shows and learn about herself. For the record: 'I'm not married, not pregnant, didn't have a boob job, no Botox. What else?'</p> <p>If it sounds as though she has figured life out, well, she hasn't. 'Here's one thing I don't get,' she says. 'Why are people afraid of getting older? You feel wiser. You feel more mature. You feel like you know yourself better. You would trade that for softer skin? Not me!' </p> <h2>AK-27 <br>A timeline</h2> <p><strong>1981</strong> Born in Moscow on 7 June.

  "<p>The liberation of Bergen-Belsen in April 1945 by the British provided the first newsreel and radio coverage of the concentration camps. The images of emaciated bodies and piles of corpses being bulldozed into mass graves have provided a frozen picture of horror and of hell. Though memory fades, and though a squabble of voices attempts to diminish the crimes of Nazi Germany by making feeble comparisons with later atrocities, there has not yet been a second attempt by a state at total genocide using industrial methods of mass murder against an entire civilian population, partly made up of its own citizens.</p> <p>Nazi Germany was not the same as, say, the French in Algeria, the Americans in Indochina or the Israelis in Palestine (to use the currently fashionable analogy). Auschwitz and Belsen were merely the most famous examples of a death cult, Abu Ghraib magnified by the millions. The Nazis dehumanised everybody they could lay their hands on. Captured members of the French Resistance were shipped off to Germany for 'war work'. Considering themselves to be political prisoners, and demanding to be treated as such, they found themselves in conditions barely better than the camps, with only occasional letters from home and the privilege of having some contact with a local population that contained sympathetic individuals whose minds had not been, in a word used by a Polish guide showing me round Auschwitz a decade ago, 'destructed'.</p> <p>Immediately after the war, Agn\u00e8s Humbert, a middle-aged intellectual with a developed political consciousness, published an account of her four-year incarceration, first in a French prison in the centre of Paris, then as a slave labourer in Germany. Her book, now translated for the first time into English, is unusually detailed, unlike those of many victims who chose not to tell their stories until years later when memory was no longer fresh. Humbert was an unusual woman. Born in 1894, the daughter of an army officer, she became a Symbolist painter and married an Egyptian artist, moving with him to a Breton village to raise their two sons. A photograph of her taken in 1921 with shingled hair and a loose dress, perched on a rock, shows a decisive mouth and chin and burning eyes.</p> <p>Humbert was an early anti-fascist and a woman of the left when those terms meant fellow travelling with the Soviet Union. After her marriage broke up in 1934, she went to work at the anthropological institute, the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris, part of a distinguished team of specialists in art and culture that as soon as France fell in 1940 formed one of the earliest organised Resistance groups. </p> <p>It is because they were the first that the activities for which she was punished now seem so paltry: a little newspaper, scrawling slogans on banknotes. But the underground circle was quickly betrayed and its members arrested. Humbert was taken to a prison on the rue du Cherche-Midi, where she spent a year in solitary confinement.</p> <p>In her coffin-like cell, there is nothing but the loneliness and mental torment of total isolation, apart from a system of communication with the other prisoners whom she never sees. But the French prison is luxury compared with the deportation to Germany. If you ignore, for a moment, Nazi Germany's political ideology and ask what made it tick, the answer is sadism. It enjoyed inflicting pain and reducing human beings to zeroes. </p> <p>It did not only do this to Jews, Gypsies and Slavs, and its enemies like Humbert, but to its own citizens for pathetically trivial infractions of domestic law. The slave labour units were governed by the same principles as the death camps: work the inmates to death on starvation rations in an experiment to see what the human body can endure before it gives out. </p> <p>Humbert's account is agony to read and the reader is frequently forced to ask if one could have survived more than a few days under the torture she describes. The women are covered in crabs and lice, they are making rayon in factories with toxic chemicals burning their skin, fed on a few hundred calories a day. They have no soap. They own a toothbrush and comb that they continuously steal from one another. Without scissors, their toenails grow into their own flesh. Not even the clothes on their backs are exclusively their own. To differentiate her time in Germany from the imprisonment in France, she points out: 'Here we suffer physical pain in all its manifestations and we are not spared mental torture either.' </p> <p>What kept Agn\u00e8s Humbert going was the particular constituents of her personality: her will, her optimism and her political beliefs. She is absolutely certain that Germany will be defeated because she believes in a moral universe in which all is set to rights again by human struggle. The resistance of the title is not those few heady months in Paris in which intellectual plotters met in flats to dream up escapades, but the internal resistance to what must have seemed like the inevitable failure to survive the horrors inflicted upon a middle-aged woman with no experience of physical labour. </p> <p>But the Nazis are not capable of making her 'destructed'. From the moment she is liberated by the Americans, her formidable powers of organisation are revived, ready to help the newly occupying forces alleviate the suffering of survivors and arrest the perpetrators. She returned to France, but her health was damaged by what she had endured. She died in 1963. Her book adds to the small record of how the human mind can preserve the heart and soul intact against all attempts to annihilate it.</p> <p>\u2022 Linda Grant's latest novel, The Clothes on Their Backs, is shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2008</p>",
  "<h2>No Isa ... but Barclays did send me someone's personal details </h2> <p>Barclays took a long time to open my Tax Haven Isa and meanwhile I lost interest because I had taken money out of a savings account to pay for it. But then, Barclays sent me details of someone else's application, including postcode, date of birth, mother's maiden name, National Insurance number and home telephone number. I phoned the other person and was astounded to hear that she had received details of yet a third person. If this is not a fraudster's charter, I don't what is. In six weeks, I have received just two standard letters saying Barclays is dealing with my complaint. <br><strong>JL, Whitby</strong></p> <p>Breaking the Data Protection Act is far more serious than losing a few weeks' interest. Barclays blames a machinery malfunction and insists you have not suffered a breach of confidentiality, although it cannot say the same for the person whose details you received or the woman whose information she saw.</p> <p>In fact Barclays never did open your Isa. When you heard there would be a further four-week delay, you moved your money back to your savings account until it was needed. But Barclays didn't warn you when it was about to process your application so there was insufficient money in your cheque account to pay for it. The bank has now opened your Isa, backdated \u00a382 interest to the start of the tax year, which is before you even applied, and sent a hamper to apologise.</p> <p>PE of Oxford earned no interest at all on \u00a33,600 while waiting for Barclays to open her Isa. She had complained in mid-May and was promised a response by 22 June but had no resolution a month after that. The branch told her interest was paid from the date of application, but this is wrong. Normally, if it hasn't managed to open an account within 14 days, Barclays backdates interest to then. For PE, the bank agreed to date interest - \u00a314 - from the time it received her application and sent a couple of bottles of wine. </p> <p>GH of Sale suffered delays when opening a Lloyds TSB cash Isa with \u00a334,000 transferred from Kent Reliance Building Society and NS&amp;I. Kent Reliance sent the money on 19 May but Lloyds didn't credit it until 10 June. The NS&amp;I money took two weeks. Kent Reliance and NS&amp;I were quick to point out that there were no delays at their end. Lloyds has backdated interest - \u00a355 - to the date it received the money and sent \u00a325 to apologise.</p> <h2>How many advisers does it take to transfer \u00a3686?</h2> <p>I have a personal pension with Sun Alliance, now worth just \u00a3686. I asked Scottish Widows if I could transfer the funds into my existing Scottish Widows pension. It said it could not accept the money unless I took advice from an independent financial adviser. I found one who would charge several hundred pounds, which is clearly disproportionate to the value of the transfer. He confirmed to Scottish Widows by phone that I had sought his advice but would not produce a written report. Scottish Widows would not proceed and suggested I consult another adviser. <br><strong>JD, Gainsborough</strong></p> <p>Customer services departments can be so plain stupid at times. Not one of the three people who wrote to you had the common sense to ask someone more senior to override the rule book. I can see the sense in Scottish Widows making sure that policyholders check they are doing the right thing, but there are limits.</p> <p>Fortunately, someone higher up has now looked at your request and decided that the insurer will accept this small amount of money without an IFA's written report.</p> <h2>The Student Loan Company told me I was lying. I wasn't</h2> <p>I have not received a statement from the Student Loans Company since February 2005, despite paying monthly by direct debit. I phoned last October and was told I was lying about my residential history. I assured the operative I was giving my parents' address and he finally conceded there might be a problem. It seems the statements were being sent to an address in west London where I have never lived, allegedly at my request.</p> <p>I asked for copies at my correct address so I could check if this was identity fraud. Nothing arrived. This September I received login details to check my balance online but found someone else's phone numbers and email address under my personal details.<br><strong>AL, Barnet</strong></p> <p>The Student Loans Company (SLC) apologises unreservedly. It admits to a careless mistake in wrongly changing your address on its files. The new address belonged to another borrower with a similar account number. When you phoned last October, SLC corrected your address but failed to amend the telephone numbers or email address. It is appalling that you should have been able to see someone else's details but this has now been put right.</p> <h2>My cheque's in the post - or it was for a while</h2> <p>My wife and I hold Marks &amp; Spencer shares. In July, my wife received the final dividend but I did not. To be fair, we moved home three years ago but I never changed my address with the company's registrar, Equiniti. However, I pay the Royal Mail to redirect our letters. </p> <p>Equiniti said I should write in and it would charge \u00a311.75 to re-issue the cheque. After two weeks I phoned again and was informed that it had not received my correspondence. I have phoned several times more. It is now September and I am no further than I was in July. <br><strong>PS, Wirral</strong></p> <p>The redirection service let you down and your cheque arrived back at Equiniti marked 'gone away'. At this point, Equiniti should have made an effort to find you. Then it wrongly scanned your letter on to your wife's account. Equiniti has now sent a replacement cheque, added \u00a325 to apologise for poor service and waived the \u00a311.75 fee.</p> <p>\u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at <a href=\"mailto:money.writes@observer.co.uk\">money.writes@observer.co.uk</a> or write to Margaret Dibben The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ and include a telephone number.

  "<p>Ed Harris made his directorial debut eight years ago in a biography of Jackson Pollock in which he played the title role. He's now followed this up with a fine western, Appaloosa. This is singularly appropriate. Back in the postwar decade, Pollock's paintings were promoted in the Cold War as an expression of American freedom and individuality, while Pollock was sold to a US public more than a little hostile to abstract art as the archetypal western hero.</p> <p>Pollock was born near Cody, Wyoming, a town named in honour of Buffalo Bill, and drifted around Arizona with itinerant workers before heading east as, in the words of his biographer BH Friedman: 'A hard-riding, hard-drinking cowboy from the Wild West who came roaring, maybe even shooting, his way into New York where he took the art galleries by storm.'</p> <p>Based on a novel by Robert B Parker (creator of the Boston private eye Spenser), Appaloosa not only stars its director, but he's also co-scriptwriter and producer, and sings a Willie Nelson-style song over the final credits. In addition, he's cast his father Bob as a grizzled frontier judge who presides over a murder trial in an improvised court and has one of the film's best lines. 'You got a horse, son?' he asks a witness who's just testified against a ruthless killer. 'Then you better get on it now, ride fast and don't look back.' Yet this is no vanity project. It's a handsome, subtle, sober film, well acted all around, that plays interesting variations on familiar themes, deliberately alluding to High Noon, Rio Bravo, 3.10 to Yuma, My Darling Clementine and Unforgiven.</p> <p>Set in New Mexico in the early 1880s, the film is narrated by Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), a West Point-trained ex-cavalry officer who's given up Indian fighting to become deputy to the hardened lawman Virgil Cole (Ed Harris). For a dozen years, they've been travelling the West, imposing order on new communities, and they're called to the town of Appaloosa by the venal city fathers led by a pompous merchant and saloon owner (Timothy Spall). Their task is to bring to justice rancher-businessman Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), friend of the 21st US President Chester Arthur. Bragg intends to take over the local copper mines, until recently threatened by Apaches, and dominate the territory, and his band of hired ruffians have killed Appaloosa's marshal and two deputies. Cole accepts the job and quite literally before the ink has dried on a contract of his own devising, he and Hitch have killed three of Bragg's men.</p> <p>There follows a contest of will and nerve between Cole and Bragg that leads to a daring arrest, the holding of the rancher for trial, and the dangerous journey by train to the territorial penitentiary. Into Cole's life comes a good-looking widow, Allison French (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), for whom he falls, though perceiving her contradictions. His hostage to fortune, she's an innocent schemer, not one of the 'whores and squaws' he's previously associated with, but still a puzzling cross between saloon girl and homemaker. </p> <p>Each incident is familiar but smartly handled and given a little twist. There's the pursuit of Bragg and the gunslingers who've kidnapped the widow and sprung him, an encounter with a party of Apache braves, and an outstandingly staged shoot-out in the plaza of an old Spanish town that, like the gunfight at the OK Corral, is brief and deadly. </p> <p>Magnificently shot by Australian photographer Dean Semler (he worked on Dances With Wolves and the TV mini-series Lonesome Dove), the film has an authentic feel without the corrosive cynicism that often tarnishes revisionist westerns. And it's a clean piece of storytelling that dispenses with narrative bridges: the passing of a considerable stretch of time, for instance, is conveyed by the skeleton of a house Cole is building for Mrs French suddenly becoming a comfortable home.</p> <p>But ultimately the most attractive aspect of this film resides in the leading characters and, most especially, the relationship between Mortensen and Harris, so splendid together in Cronenberg's A History of Violence. A variation on Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp, they're complementary, mutually respecting men of honour. Hitch is introspective, articulate, educated, reserved, while Cole is compulsive, explosive, an autodidact who knows little of himself. A running joke involves Cole's search for the mot juste he hasn't quite grasped from his reading of Emerson and other deep authors, and he constantly turns to Hitch for a prompt. This joke is extended to the misspelt sign over the sheriff's office saying 'CITY MARSHALL', which presumably Cole hasn't noticed and Hitch is too gentlemanly to point out.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 1.8 million British pensioners who believe they may be entitled to pension credit have just seven days to apply before the amount they can claim in back-dated credit is slashed.</p> <p>From 6 October, the time limit for back-dated claims will be reduced from 12 months to three, and charity Age Concern is urging anyone who thinks they may have been entitled to pension credit for more than three months to sign up this week. </p> <p>A spokeswoman says: 'As long as you have your application in, you will be entitled to up to 12 months' back money, even if your case hasn't been processed by the 6 October deadline.'</p> <p>According to Department for Work and Pensions figures, almost a third of those people who are entitled to pension credit - up to 1.8 million pensioners - are failing to claim their share of the up to \u00a32.8bn of pension credit unclaimed each year.</p> <p>The credit was introduced five years ago to help retired people struggling to make ends meet on very low incomes. It is split: the guaranteed part tops up a pensioner's income to \u00a3124.05 a week, so if your only income is the full state pension (\u00a390.70 a week), you would get an extra \u00a333.35.</p> <p>The second part, the savings credit, is designed to reward people who have moderate amounts put away for their retirement by providing a small amount of cash on top of the income generated by their private savings. </p> <p>An individual can have a weekly income of up to \u00a3174 from a combination of state pension and private savings and still qualify for pension credit of \u00a319.71 a week. A couple can have income of \u00a3255 and pension credit of \u00a326.13. </p> <p>According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 4.4 million pensioners are entitled to claim pension credit but 1.8 million have so far failed to register, missing out on an average of \u00a31,477 a year. </p> <p>Age Concern says many are deterred by the 35-page application document, or the stigma of applying for a means-tested benefit. Others simply don't realise they could be entitled to extra cash each week.</p> <p>Stanley and Mavis Harwood, aged 79 and 76 respectively, had no idea that they qualified for pension credit and other benefits until Stanley went to hospital for a triple heart-bypass operation. The social worker referred them to their local Age Concern, where adviser Sue Wood gave them a free benefits check.</p> <p>'I was so taken aback when she told me that we were entitled to \u00a3250 a week and \u00a38,000 in backdated benefits,' says Stanley. 'I was in shock for a couple of weeks - I kept thinking it was an error. Claiming pension credit and our other benefits has helped us enormously and really improved our quality of life. It has wiped out all of our fears completely.' </p> <p>The Harwoods used the lump sum to buy a stair lift and an electric buggy to improve their mobility, and Stanley says the continuing payments have enabled him to heat his home without worrying about rising fuel prices. </p> <p>'We've always been able to manage, but now I don't have to worry about what we can afford,' he says.</p> <p>Age Concern is calling on the government to introduce automatic payment of the credit to those who qualify. A spokeswoman says: 'The Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue and Customs have information about most of the types of income that people receive, and by sharing information about people's national insurance, income and savings records they should be able to work out who is entitled to receive benefits, and pay these automatically. We want this to happen as soon as possible.'</p> <p>Application forms for pension credit can be ordered by calling the Pension Credit Line on 0800 991234, or they can be downloaded from the Pension Service's website at: <a href=\"http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pdf/pensioncredit/pc1apr08-print.pdf\">thepensionservice.gov.uk/pdf/pensioncredit/pc1apr08-print.pdf</a>. </p> <p>Age Concern branches also stock the forms and will help you fill them in.

  "<h2>Go west to find Britons who speak languages</h2> <p>While it may be true that many native speakers of English cannot speak any language bar their own, to conflate them with other Britons is misleading ('Learn languages or lose out on a job', Liz Lightfoot, News, last week). In the land which I call home, and which is also inhabited by fellow Britons, we are leading the way in bi- and multi-lingual education. </p> <p>In Wales, all schoolchildren up to 16 learn both Welsh and English, and often supplement these core subjects with other languages, notably French, German, Spanish and Italian. However, they are not limited to these subjects; many of my compatriots come from other linguistic backgrounds - Somali, Hindi, Punjabi and Chinese.</p> <p>Education in Wales is now devolved to the National Assembly, so any mention of Britain being near the bottom of a league table for student competence is misleading. Further, the comment that 'the British government's decision to allow pupils to drop a modern foreign language at 14' leads one to suppose that Westminster still dictates on these matters to other parts of the so-called United Kingdom. Not so.<br><strong>Sion Rees Williams</strong><br>Dunstable, Bedfordshire</p> <p>Liz Lightfoot emphasises the dearth of interpreters and, after a working life exporting British goods to the rest of Europe, I can vouch for the scarcity of linguists in business and sales. </p> <p>Willy Brandt insisted it was the duty of salespeople to speak the language of prospective buyers, whatever their nationality. It is a myth to suppose that all Dutch people, for example, are fluent English speakers. Not only are they flattered when approached in their language but the salesperson is off to a flying start.<br><strong>Jem Cook</strong><br>Marlborough, Wiltshire</p> <h2>Some of us are all right, Jack</h2> <p>Your article 'Savers, pensioners, homeowners ... no one can hide from the fallout' (Cash, last week) proclaimed: 'Every household will have been touched in some way.' Sorry guys, this is not the case. I conducted a straw poll of my friends and colleagues, mostly aged 45-60. We've lived through several 'recessions' and learnt many lessons from them. We have all paid off our mortgages and, while the value of our houses may be diminishing, negative equity is not an issue. And if we do decide to sell and buy elsewhere, it doesn't matter because all house prices are falling. Many of us have been in the property market for 25 years or more. I have seen two-bed flats in Islington rise from about \u00a3100,000 in the early Nineties to nearly \u00a3550,000 in 2008. Even if property values fall by 30 per cent, that is still a very good return.<br><strong>Karen Swinden</strong><br>Evesham, Worcestershire</p> <h2>Who are you calling soft?</h2> <p>So Barbara Ellen thinks that men consider teaching and care work as 'chick' work and are thus afraid to take low-paid work and get their hands dirty ('Prejudice isn't what keeps men out of nurseries', Opinion, last week). One wonders why we never see women in those other low-paid jobs digging trenches or climbing scaffolding or brushing the streets and emptying bins. Could it be women prefer to leave the dirty work to men?</p> <p>As for teaching, Ellen should be aware that most university and teacher-training places are taken by women (65 per cent and 83 per cent respectively), and part of the problem is that women in the profession see this as a female role to the exclusion of men who run the risk of accusations of paedophilia.</p> <p>How many men, Ms Ellen, have a cushy job like yours slagging off men on a weekly basis as a career. Soft or what?<br><strong>Harry Tauber</strong><br>Belfast</p> <h2>We do consult teachers</h2> <p>Whether you're a teacher, an architect, or - as I am - head of the agency responsible for delivering Building Schools for the Future, high-quality design that transforms the way students learn and teachers teach is non-negotiable ('Teachers demand a greater voice in design of schools', News, last week). Student and teacher views are an essential part of ensuring we design and build schools which are safe, welcoming, inspirational and reflect 21st-century teaching and learning styles.<br><strong>Tim Byles CBE</strong><br>Chief executive, Partnerships for Schools,<br>London SW1</p> <h2>Pain in Spain? Think again</h2> <p>I was disappointed to read James Robinson's piece about how the major economies of the world are coping with the slowdown ('There's pain in Spain, but the Germans are doing fine', Business, last week). His remarks about the Spanish economy did not take sufficiently into account some positive aspects. It is true that after 13 years of growth Spain could slip into recession, like most of the countries of the eurozone. It is also true that our banking system is under pressure due to the adjustment of the housing market. But lending practices in Spain have remained prudent under the strict supervision of the Bank of Spain. Thanks to this, Spanish banks have not been hit directly by the subprime crisis, but only indirectly by tighter international credit conditions, and they are well placed to withstand the turmoil.</p> <p>There might be pain in Spain, but the economic changes that have turned Spain into a competitive economy are here to stay.<br><strong>Carles Casajuana</strong><br>The Spanish Ambassador<br>London SW1</p> <h2>Check it out</h2> <p>Oh dear, I don't think you should let your poor food journalists out of Sainsbury's and into the big scary real world ('Stuck in the Lidl with you', OFM). Poor Eva Wiseman appeared to be so bemused by the sight of people 'scrambling for fowl' and pushing past her with 'bags full of tripe' (not sold at Lidl by the way) that she missed the great value vegetables, scrumptious charcuterie, yummy cheese and amazingly cheap 70 per cent cocoa choccy. Oh well, she does admit that her only reason for shopping in Sainsbury's is that she once saw Lily Allen in there. Well I met my mate Gary Cut in Lidl yesterday and we had a fine discussion about the merits of lard and beer. Unlike in Hackney, the employees in my local branch are always friendly and helpful.

A posh local village, Petham in Kent, had a pub called the Duke whose sign showed in profile the 1st Duke of Wellington. The brewery sold the pub to a private owner who replaced the sign with one depicting the jazz musician Duke Ellington on one side and John Wayne on the other. Sadly, his humour was not appreciated by the upper-crust locals, whose boycott eventually led to the Duke's closure.<br><strong>Jim Martin</strong><br>Canterbury, Kent</p> <h2>Write to us</h2> <p>Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday). <strong>Fax: 020 7837 7817</strong>.

  "<p>On 3 May 2005, in France, a man called an emergency hotline for missing and exploited children. He frantically explained that he was a tourist passing through Orthez, near the western Pyrenees, and that at the train station he had encountered a 15-year-old boy who was alone, and terrified. Another hotline received a similar call, and the boy eventually arrived, by himself, at a local government child-welfare office. Slender and short, with pale skin and trembling hands, he wore a muffler around much of his face and had a baseball cap pulled over his eyes. He had no money and carried little more than a mobile phone and ID which said that his name was Francisco Hernandez Fernandez and that he was born on 13 December 1989 in C\u00e1ceres, Spain. Initially he barely spoke, but after some prodding he revealed that his parents and younger brother had been killed in a car accident. The crash left him in a coma for several weeks and, upon recovering, he was sent to live with an uncle, who abused him. Finally he fled to France, where his mother had grown up.</p> <p>French authorities placed Francisco at the St Vincent de Paul shelter in the nearby city of Pau. A state-run institution that housed about 35 boys and girls, most of whom had either been removed from dysfunctional families or abandoned, the shelter was in an old stone building with peeling white wooden shutters; on the roof was a statue of St Vincent protecting a child in the folds of his gown. Francisco was given a single room, and he seemed relieved to be able to wash and change in private: his head and body, he explained, were covered in burns and scars from the car accident. He was enrolled at the Coll\u00e8ge Jean Monnet, a local secondary school that had 400 or so students, mostly from tough neighbourhoods, and a reputation for violence. Although students were forbidden to wear hats, the principal at the time, Claire Chadourne, made an exception for Francisco, who said that he feared being teased about his scars. Like many of the social workers and teachers who dealt with Francisco, Chadourne, who had been an educator for more than 30 years, felt protective towards him. With his baggy pants and his mobile phone dangling from a cord around his neck, he looked like a typical teenager, but he seemed deeply traumatised. He never changed his clothes in front of the others in gym class, and resisted being subjected to a medical exam. He spoke softly, with his head bowed, and recoiled if anyone touched him.</p> <p>Gradually Francisco began hanging out with other kids at break and participating in class. Since he had enrolled so late in the school year, his literature teacher asked another student, Rafael Pessoa De Almeida, to help him with his coursework. Before long, Francisco was helping Rafael. 'This guy can learn like lightning,' Rafael recalls thinking.</p> <p>One day after school, Rafael asked Francisco if he wanted to go ice skating, and the two became friends, playing video games and sharing school gossip. Rafael sometimes picked on his younger brother, and Francisco, recalling that he used to mistreat his own sibling, advised: 'Make sure you love your brother and stay close.'</p> <p>At one point Rafael borrowed Francisco's mobile phone; to his surprise, its address book and call log were protected by security codes. When Rafael returned the phone, Francisco displayed a photograph on its screen of a young boy who looked just like Francisco. 'That's my brother,' he said.</p> <p>Francisco was soon one of the most popular kids in school, dazzling classmates with his knowledge of music and arcane slang - he even knew American idioms - and moving effortlessly between rival cliques. 'The students loved him,' a teacher recalls. 'He had this aura about him, this charisma.'</p> <p>During tryouts for a talent show, the music teacher asked Francisco if he was interested in performing. He handed her a CD to play, then walked to the end of the room and tilted his hat flamboyantly, waiting for the music to start. As Michael Jackson's song 'Unbreakable' filled the room, Francisco started to dance like the pop star, twisting his limbs and lip-synching the words 'You can't believe it, you can't conceive it/And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable'. Everyone in the room watched in awe. 'He didn't just look like Michael Jackson,' the music teacher recalled. 'He was Michael Jackson.'</p> <p>Later, in computer class, Francisco showed Rafael an internet image of a small reptile with a slithery tongue. 'What is it?' Rafael asked. 'A chameleon,' Francisco replied.</p> <p>On 8 June, an administrator rushed into the principal's office. She said she'd been watching a TV programme about one of the world's most infamous impostors: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin, a 30-year-old Frenchman who serially impersonated children. 'I swear to God, Bourdin looks exactly like Francisco Hernandez Fernandez,' the administrator said.</p> <p>Chadourne was incredulous: 30 would make Francisco older than some of her teachers. She did a quick internet search for 'Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin'. Hundreds of news items came up about the 'king of impostors' and the 'master of new identities' who, like Peter Pan, 'didn't want to grow up'. A photograph of Bourdin closely resembled Francisco: there was the same formidable chin, the same gap between the front teeth. Chadourne called the police.</p> <p>When they arrived, Chadourne sent the assistant principal to summon Francisco from class. As Francisco entered Chadourne's office, the police seized him and thrust him against the wall, causing her to panic: what if he really was an abused orphan? Then, while handcuffing Bourdin, the police removed his baseball cap. There were no scars on his head; rather, he was going bald. 'I want a lawyer,' he said, his voice suddenly dropping to that of a man.</p> <p>At the police station, he admitted he was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin, and that in the past 15 years he had invented scores of identities. His aliases included Benjamin Kent, Jimmy Morins, Alex Dole, Sladjan Raskovic, Arnaud Orions, Giovanni Petrullo and Michelangelo Martini. News reports claimed he had even impersonated a tiger tamer and a priest, but in truth he had nearly always played a similar character: an abused or abandoned child. He was unusually adept at transforming his appearance - his facial hair, his weight, his walk, his mannerisms. 'I can become whatever I want,' he liked to say. In 2004, when he pretended to be a 14-year-old French boy in the town of Grenoble, a doctor who examined him at the request of authorities concluded he was, indeed, a teenager. A police captain in Pau noted, 'When he talked in Spanish, he became a Spaniard. When he talked in English, he was an Englishman.' Chadourne said of him: 'Of course he lied, but what an actor!'</p> <p>Over the years, Bourdin had insinuated himself into youth shelters, orphanages, foster homes, junior high schools and children's hospitals. His trail of cons extended to, among other places, Spain, Germany, Belgium, England, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Bosnia, Portugal, Austria, France, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark and America. The US State Department warned he was an 'exceedingly clever' man who posed as a desperate child in order to 'win sympathy', and a French prosecutor called him 'an incredible illusionist whose perversity is matched only by his intelligence'. Bourdin himself has said, 'I am a manipulator... My job is to manipulate.'</p> <p>In Pau, the authorities launched an investigation to determine why a 30-year-old man would pose as a teenage orphan. They found no evidence of sexual deviance or paedophilia; they did not uncover any financial motive either.</p> <p>'In my 22 years on the job, I've never seen a case like it,' Eric Maurel, the prosecutor said. 'Usually people con for money. His profit seems to have been purely emotional.'</p> <p>On his right forearm, police discovered a tattoo. It said 'cam\u00e9l\u00e9on nantais' - 'Chameleon from Nantes'.</p> <p>'Mr Grann,' Bourdin said, politely extending his hand to me. We were on a street in the centre of Pau, where he had agreed to meet me one morning last autumn. For once he seemed unmistakably an adult. He was dressed theatrically, in white trousers and shirt, a checked vest, white shoes, a blue satin bow tie and a foppish hat. Only the gap between his teeth evoked the memory of Francisco Hernandez Fernandez.</p> <p>After his ruse in Pau had been exposed, Bourdin moved to a village in the Pyrenees, 25 miles away. 'I wanted to escape from all the glare,' he said. As had often been the case with Bourdin's deceptions, the authorities were not sure how to punish him. Psychiatrists determined that he was sane. ('Is he a psychopath?' one doctor testified. 'Absolutely not.') Ultimately, he was charged with obtaining and using a fake ID, and received a six-month suspended sentence.</p> <p>Bourdin and I sat down on a bench near the train station as a light rain began to fall. A car paused by the kerb in front of us, with a couple inside. They rolled down the window, peered out, and said to each other: 'Le Cam\u00e9l\u00e9on.'</p> <p>'I am quite famous in France these days,' Bourdin said. 'Too famous.'</p> <p>As we spoke, his brown eyes flitted across me, seemingly taking me in. One of his police interrogators called him a 'human recorder'. To my surprise, Bourdin knew where I'd worked, where I was born, the name of my wife, even what my sister and brother did for a living. 'I like to know who I'm meeting,' he said. 'I don't trust anybody,' he went on. For a person who described himself as a 'professional liar', he seemed oddly fastidious about the facts of his own life. </p> <p>'I don't want you to make me into somebody I'm not. The story is good enough without embellishment.' </p> <p>I knew Bourdin had grown up in and around Nantes, and I asked him about his tattoo. Why would someone who tried to erase his identity leave a trace of one? He rubbed his arm where the words were imprinted on his skin. Then he said, 'I will tell you the truth behind all my lies.'</p> <p>Before he was Benjamin Kent or Michelangelo Martini - before he was the child of an English judge or an Italian diplomat - he was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pierre Bourdin, the illegitimate son of Ghislaine Bourdin, who was 18 and poor when she gave birth to him, in a suburb of Paris, on 13 June 1974. On government forms, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's father is often listed as 'X', meaning his identity was unknown. But Ghislaine, during an interview at her small house in a rural area in western France, told me that 'X' was a 25-year-old Algerian immigrant named Kaci whom she had met at a margarine factory where they both worked. She said that she could no longer remember his surname. After she became pregnant, she discovered Kaci was already married, and so she left her job and did not tell him she was carrying his child.</p> <p>Ghislaine raised Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric until he was two-and-a-half - 'He was like any other child, totally normal,' she says - at which time child services intervened at the behest of her parents. A relative says of Ghislaine: 'She liked to drink and dance and stay out at night. She didn't want anything to do with that child.' Ghislaine insists she had obtained another factory job and was perfectly competent, but the judge placed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric in her parents' custody. Years later, Ghislaine wrote Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric a letter, telling him: 'You are my son and they stole you from me at the age of two. They did everything to separate us from each other and we have become two strangers.'</p> <p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric says his mother had a dire need for attention, and on the rare occasions he saw her, she would feign being deathly ill and make him run to get help. 'To see me frightened gave her pleasure,' he says. Though Ghislaine denies this, she acknowledges that she once attempted suicide and her son had to rush to find assistance.</p> <p>When Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was five, he moved with his grandparents to Mouchamps, a hamlet southeast of Nantes. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - part Algerian and fatherless, and dressed in secondhand clothes from Catholic charities - was a village outcast, and in school he began to tell fabulous stories about himself. He said his father was never around because he was a 'British secret agent'. One of his primary school teachers, Yvon Bourgueil, describes Bourdin as a precocious and captivating child, who had an extraordinary imagination and visual sense, drawing wild, beautiful comic strips. 'He had this way of making you connect to him,' Bourgueil recalls. He also noticed signs of mental distress. At one point, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric told his grandparents that he had been molested by a neighbour, though nobody in the tightly knit village investigated the allegation. In one of his comic strips, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric depicted himself drowning in a river. He increasingly misbehaved, acting up in class and stealing from neighbours. At 12 he was sent to live at Les Gr\u00e9zilli\u00e8res, a private facility for juveniles in Nantes.</p> <p>There, his 'little dramas', as one of his teachers called them, became more fanciful. Bourdin often pretended to be an amnesiac, intentionally getting lost in the streets. In 1990, after he turned 16, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was forced to move to another youth home, but he soon ran away. He hitchhiked to Paris where, scared and hungry, he invented his first fake character: he approached a police officer and told him he was a lost British teenager named Jimmy Sale. </p> <p>'I dreamed they would send me to England, where I always imagined life was more beautiful,' he recalls. When the police discovered that he spoke almost no English, he admitted his deceit and was returned to the youth home. But he had devised what he calls his 'technique', and in this fashion he began to wander across Europe, moving in and out of orphanages and foster homes, searching for the 'perfect shelter'. In 1991, he was found in a train station in Langres, France, pretending to be sick, and was placed in a children's hospital in Saint Dizier. According to his medical report, no one knew 'who he was or where he came from'. Answering questions only in writing, he indicated that his name was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cassis - a play on his father's first name, Kaci. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's doctor, Jean-Paul Milanese, wrote in a letter to a child-welfare judge: 'We find ourselves confronted with a young runaway teen, mute, having broken with his former life.'</p> <p>On a piece of paper, Bourdin scribbled what he wanted most: 'A home and a school. That's all.'</p> <p>When doctors started to unravel his past, Bourdin confessed his real identity and moved on. 'I'd rather leave on my own than be taken away,' he told me. During his career as an impostor, Bourdin often disclosed the truth, as if the attention that came from exposure was as thrilling as the con itself.</p> <p>On 13 June 1992, after he had posed as more than a dozen fictional children, Bourdin turned 18, becoming a legal adult. 'I'd been in shelters and foster homes most of my life, and suddenly I was told: \"That's it. You're free to go,\"' he recalls. 'How could I become something I could not imagine?' In November 1993, posing as a mute child, he lay down in the middle of a street in the French town of Auch and was taken by firemen to a hospital. La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi, a local newspaper, ran a story about him, asking: 'Where does this mute adolescent... come from?' The next day, the paper published another article, under the headline 'The Mute Adolescent Who Appeared Out of Nowhere Has Still Not Revealed His Secret'. After fleeing, he was caught attempting a similar ruse nearby and admitted he was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin. 'The Mute of Auch Speaks Four Languages,' La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi proclaimed.</p> <p>As Bourdin assumed more and more identities, he attempted to kill off his real one. One day the mayor of Mouchamps received a call from the 'German police' notifying him that Bourdin's body had been found in Munich. When Bourdin's mother was told the news, she recalls, 'My heart stopped.' Members of Bourdin's family waited for a coffin to arrive, but it never did. 'It was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric playing one of his cruel games,' his mother says.</p> <p>By the mid-Nineties, Bourdin had accumulated a criminal record for lying to police and magistrates, and Interpol and other authorities were increasingly on the lookout for him. His activities were also garnering media attention. In 1995 the producers of a popular French TV programme called Everything Is Possible invited him on to the show. As Bourdin appeared on stage, looking pale and prepubescent, the host teasingly asked the audience: 'What's this boy's name? Michael, J\u00fcrgen, Kevin or Pedro? What's his real age - 13, 14, 15?' Pressed about his motivations, Bourdin again insisted all he wanted was love and a family. It was the same rationale he always gave, and as a result he was the rare impostor who elicited sympathy as well as anger from those he had duped. (His mother has a less charitable interpretation of her son's stated motive: 'He wants to justify what he has become.')</p> <p>The producers of Everything Is Possible were so affected by his story that they offered him a job in the station's newsroom, but he soon ran off to create more 'interior fictions', as one of the producers later told a reporter. At times, Bourdin's deceptions were viewed in existential terms. One of his devotees in France created a website that celebrated his shape-shifting, hailing him as an 'actor of life and an apostle of a new philosophy of human identity'.</p> <p>One day when I was visiting Bourdin, he described how he transformed himself. First, he said, he conceived of a person whom he wanted to play. Then he gradually mapped out the character's biography, from his heritage to his family to his tics. 'The key is actually not lying about everything,' Bourdin said. 'Otherwise you'll just mix things up.' He said he adhered to maxims such as 'keep it simple' and 'a good liar uses the truth'. In choosing a name, he preferred one that carried a deep association in his memory, like Cassis. 'The one thing you'd better not forget is your name,' he said.</p> <p>He compared what he did to being a spy: you changed superficial details while keeping your core intact. This approach not only made it easier to convince people; it allowed him to protect a part of his self, to hold on to some moral centre. 'I know I can be cruel, but I don't want to become a monster,' he said.</p> <p>Once he had imagined a character, he fashioned an appropriate appearance: meticulously shaving his face, plucking his eyebrows, using hair-removal creams. He often put on baggy pants and a shirt with long sleeves that swallowed his wrists, emphasising his smallness. Peering in a mirror, he asked himself if others would see what he wanted them to see. 'The worst thing you can do is deceive yourself,' he said.</p> <p>When he honed an identity, it was crucial to find some element of the character that he shared - a technique employed by many actors. 'People always say to me: \"Why don't you become an actor?\"' he told me. 'I think I would be a very good actor, like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone. But I don't want to play somebody. I want to be somebody.'</p> <p>In order to help ease his character into the real world, he fostered the illusion among local authorities that his character actually existed. As he had done in Orthez, he would call a hotline and claim to have seen the character in a perilous situation. The authorities were less likely to grill a child who appeared to be in distress. If someone noticed Bourdin looked oddly mature, however, he did not object. 'A teenager wants to look older,' he said. 'I treat it like a compliment.'</p> <p>Though he emphasised his cunning, he acknowledged that it is not that hard to fool others. People have basic expectations and are rarely on guard for someone to subvert them. By playing on some primal need - vanity, greed, loneliness - men like Bourdin make their marks suspend disbelief. As a result, most cons are filled with logical inconsistencies, even absurdities, which seem humiliatingly obvious after the fact. Bourdin, who generally tapped into a mark's sense of goodness rather than into some darker urge, says: 'Nobody expects a seemingly vulnerable child to be lying.'</p> <p>In October 1997, Bourdin told me, he was at a youth home in Linares, Spain. A child-welfare judge who was handling his case had given him 24 hours to prove he was a teenager; otherwise she'd take his fingerprints, which were on file with Interpol. Bourdin knew that, as an adult with a criminal record, he'd likely face prison. He had already tried to run away once and was caught, and the staff were keeping an eye on his whereabouts. And so he did something that both stretched the bounds of credulity and threatened to transform him into the kind of 'monster' he had insisted he never wanted to become. Rather than invent an identity, he stole one. He assumed the persona of a missing 16-year-old boy from Texas. Bourdin, now 23, not only had to convince the authorities that he was an American child; he had to convince the missing boy's family.</p> <p>According to Bourdin, the plan came to him in the middle of the night: if he could fool the judge into thinking that he was an American, he might be let go. He asked permission to use the telephone in the shelter's office and called the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Alexandria, Virginia, trolling for a real identity. Speaking in English, which he had picked up during his travels, he claimed his name was Jonathan Durean and that he was a director of the Linares shelter. He said a frightened child had turned up who would not disclose his identity but who spoke English with an American accent. Bourdin offered a description of the boy that matched himself - short, slight, prominent chin, brown hair, a gap between his teeth - and asked if the centre had anyone similar in its database. After searching, Bourdin recalls, a woman at the centre said the boy might be Nicholas Barclay, who had been reported missing in San Antonio on 13 June 1994, at the age of 13. Barclay was last seen, according to his file, wearing 'a white T-shirt, purple [trousers], black [trainers] and carrying a pink backpack'.</p> <p>Adopting a sceptical tone, Bourdin says, he asked if the centre could send any more information that it had regarding Barclay. The woman said she would mail overnight Barclay's missing-person flyer and immediately fax a copy as well. After giving her the fax number in the office he was borrowing, Bourdin says, he hung up and waited. At last, a copy of the flyer emerged from the fax machine. The printout was so faint most of it was illegible. Still, the photograph's resemblance to him did not seem that far off. 'I can do this,' Bourdin recalls thinking. He quickly called back the centre, he says, and told the woman: 'I have some good news. Nicholas Barclay is standing right beside me.'</p> <p>Elated, she gave him the number of the officer in the San Antonio police department who was in charge of the investigation. This time pretending to be a Spanish policeman, Bourdin says, he phoned the officer and, mentioning details about Nicholas that he had learned from the woman at the centre - such as the pink backpack - declared the missing child had been found. The officer said he'd contact the FBI and the US Embassy in Madrid. Bourdin had not fully contemplated what he was about to unleash.</p> <p>The next day at the Linares shelter, Bourdin intercepted a package from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children addressed to Jonathan Durean. He ripped open the envelope. Inside was a clean copy of Nicholas Barclay's missing-person flyer. It showed a colour photograph of a small, fair-skinned boy with blue eyes and brown hair so light that it appeared almost blond. The flyer listed several identifying features, including a cross tattooed between Barclay's right index finger and thumb. Bourdin stared at the picture and said to himself: 'I'm dead.' Not only did Bourdin not have the same tattoo, but his eyes and hair were dark brown. In haste, he burned the flyer in the shelter's courtyard, then went into the bathroom and bleached his hair. Finally, he had a friend, using a needle and ink from a pen, give him a makeshift tattoo resembling Barclay's.</p> <p>Still, there was the matter of Bourdin's eyes. He tried to conceive of a story that would explain his appearance. What if he had been abducted by a child sex ring and flown to Europe, where he had been tortured and abused, even experimented on? Yes, that could explain the eyes. His kidnappers had injected his pupils with chemicals. He had lost his Texas accent because, for more than three years of captivity, he had been forbidden to speak English. He had escaped from a locked room in a house in Spain when a guard carelessly left the door open. It was a crazy tale, one that violated his maxim to 'keep it simple', but it would have to do.</p> <p>Soon after, the phone in the office rang. Bourdin took the call. It was Nicholas Barclay's 31-year-old half-sister, Carey Gibson. 'My God, Nicky, is that you?' she asked.</p> <p>Bourdin didn't know how to respond. He adopted a muffled voice, then said: 'Yes, it's me.'</p> <p>Nicholas's mother, Beverly, got on the phone. A tough, heavyset woman with a broad face and dyed-brown hair, she worked the graveyard shift at a Dunkin' Donuts in San Antonio seven nights a week. She had never married Nicholas's father and had raised Nicholas with her two older children, Carey and Jason. (She was divorced from Carey and Jason's father, though she still used her married name, Dollarhide.) A heroin addict, she had struggled during Nicholas's youth to get off drugs. After he disappeared, she had begun to use heroin again and was now addicted to methadone. Despite these difficulties, Carey says, Beverly was not a bad mother: 'She was maybe the most functioning drug addict. We had nice things, a nice place, never went without food.' Perhaps compensating for the instability in her life, Beverly fanatically followed a routine: working at the doughnut shop from 10pm to 5am, then stopping at the Make My Day Lounge to shoot pool and have a few beers before going home to sleep. She had a hardness about her, with a cigarette-roughened voice, but people who know her also spoke to me of her <br>kindness. After her night shift, she delivered any leftover doughnuts to a homeless shelter.</p> <p>Beverly pulled the phone close to her ear. After the childlike voice on the other end said that he wanted to come home, she told me: 'I was dumbfounded and blown away.'</p> <p>Carey, who was married and had two children of her own, had often held the family together during Beverly's struggles with drug addiction. Since Nicholas's disappearance, her mother and brother had never seemed the same, and all Carey wanted was to make the family whole again. She volunteered to go to Spain to bring Nicholas home, and the packing and shipping company where she worked in sales support offered to pay her fare.</p> <p>When she arrived at the shelter, a few days later, accompanied by an official from the US Embassy, Bourdin had secluded himself in a room. What he had done, he concedes, was evil. But if he had any moral reservations they did not stop him, and after wrapping his face in a scarf and putting on a hat and sunglasses he came out of the room. He was sure Carey would instantly realise he wasn't her brother. Instead, she rushed toward him and hugged him.</p> <p>Carey was, in many ways, an ideal mark. 'My daughter has the best heart and is so easy to manipulate,' Beverly says. Carey had never travelled outside the United States, except for partying in Tijuana, and was unfamiliar with European accents and with Spain. After Nicholas disappeared, she had often watched programmes about lurid child abductions. In addition to feeling the pressure of having received money from her company to make the trip, she had the burden of deciding, as her family's representative, whether this was her long-lost brother.</p> <p>Though Bourdin referred to her as 'Carey' rather than 'Sis', as Nicholas always had, and though he had a trace of a French accent, Carey says she had little doubt that it was Nicholas. Not when he could attribute any inconsistencies to his unspeakable ordeal. Not when his nose now looked so much like her uncle Pat's. Not when he had the same tattoo as Nicholas and seemed to know so many details about her family, asking about relatives by name. 'Your heart takes over and you want to believe,' Carey says. She showed Bourdin photographs of the family and he studied each one: this is my mother; this is my half-brother; this is my grandfather.</p> <p>Neither American nor Spanish officials raised any questions once Carey had vouched for him. Nicholas had been gone for only three years, and the FBI was not primed to be suspicious of someone claiming to be a missing child. (The agency told me that, to its knowledge, it had never worked on a case like Bourdin's before.) According to authorities in Madrid, Carey swore under oath that Bourdin was her brother and an American citizen. He was granted a US passport, and the next day was on a flight to San Antonio.</p> <p>For a moment, Bourdin fantasised that he was about to become part of a real family, but halfway to America he began to 'freak out', as Carey puts it, trembling and sweating. </p> <p>As she tried to comfort him, he told her that he thought the plane was going to crash, which, he later said, is what he wanted: how else could he escape from what he had done?</p> <p>When the plane landed, on 18 October 1997, members of Nicholas's family were waiting for him at the airport. Bourdin recognised them from Carey's photographs: Beverly, Nicholas's mother; Carey's then husband, Bryan Gibson; Bryan and Carey's 14-year-old son, Codey, and their 10-year-old daughter, Chantel. Only Nicholas's brother, Jason, who was a recovering drug addict and living in San Antonio, was absent. A friend of the family videotaped the reunion, and Bourdin can be seen bundled up, his hat pulled down, his brown eyes shielded by sunglasses, his already fading tattoo covered by gloves. Though Bourdin had thought that Nicholas's relatives were going to 'hang' him, they rushed to embrace him, saying how much they had missed him. 'We were all just emotionally crazy,' Codey recalls. Nicholas's mother, however, hung back. 'She just didn't seem excited' the way you'd expect from someone 'seeing her son', Chantel told me.</p> <p>Bourdin wondered if Beverly doubted he was Nicholas, but eventually she, too, greeted him. They all got in Carey's car and stopped at McDonald's for cheeseburgers and fries. As Carey recalls it: 'He was just sitting by my mom, talking to my son,' saying how much 'he missed school and asking when he'd see Jason.'</p> <p>Bourdin went to stay with Carey and Bryan rather than live with Beverly. 'I work nights and didn't think it was good to leave him alone,' Beverly said. Carey and Bryan owned a trailer home in a desolate wooded area in Spring Branch, 35 miles north of San Antonio, and Bourdin stared out the window as the car wound along a dirt road, past rusted trucks on cinder blocks and dogs barking at the sound of the engine. As Codey puts it: 'We didn't have no internet or stuff like that. You can walk all the way to San Antonio before you get any kind of communication.'</p> <p>Their cramped trailer home was not exactly the vision of America Bourdin had imagined from movies. He shared a room with Codey and slept on a foam mattress on the floor. Bourdin knew that if he were to become Nicholas and to continue to fool even his family, he had to learn everything about him, and he began to mine information, secretly rummaging through drawers and picture albums, and watching home videos. When Bourdin discovered a detail about Nicholas's past from one family member, he would repeat it to another. He pointed out, for example, that Bryan once got mad at Nicholas for knocking Codey out of a tree. 'He knew that story,' Codey recalls, still amazed by the amount of intelligence Bourdin acquired about the family. Beverly noticed that Bourdin knelt in front of the television, just as Nicholas had. Various members of the family told me that when Bourdin seemed more standoffish than Nicholas or spoke with a strange accent they assumed it was because of the terrible treatment he said he'd suffered.</p> <p>As Bourdin came to inhabit the life of Nicholas, he was struck by what he considered to be uncanny similarities between them. Nicholas had been reported missing on Bourdin's birthday. Both came from poor, broken families; Nicholas had almost no relationship with his father, who for a long time didn't know that Nicholas was his son. Nicholas was a sweet, lonely, combustible kid who craved attention and was often in trouble at school. He had been caught stealing a pair of trainers, and his mother had planned to put him in a youth home. ('I couldn't handle him,' Beverly recalls. 'I couldn't control him.') When Nicholas was young, he was a diehard Michael Jackson fan who had collected all the singer's records and even owned a red-leather jacket like the one Jackson wears in his 'Thriller' video.</p> <p>According to Beverly, Bourdin quickly 'blended in'. He was enrolled in high school and did his homework each night, chastising Codey when he failed to study. He played Nintendo with Codey and watched movies with the family. When he saw Beverly, he hugged her and said, 'Hi, Mom.' Occasionally on Sundays, he attended church with other members of the family. 'He was really nice,' Chantel recalls. 'Really friendly.' Once, when Carey was shooting a home movie of Bourdin, she asked him what he was thinking. 'It's really good to have my family and be home again,' he replied.</p> <p>On 1 November, not long after Bourdin had settled into his new home, Charlie Parker, a private investigator, was sitting in his office in San Antonio. The room was crammed with spy cameras he deployed in the field: one was attached to a pair of eyeglasses, another was lodged inside a fountain pen, and a third was concealed on the handlebars of a bicycle. On a wall hung a photograph that Parker had taken during a stakeout: it showed a married woman with her lover, peeking out of an apartment window. Parker, who had been hired by the woman's husband, called it the 'money shot'.</p> <p>Parker's phone rang. It was a TV producer from the tabloid show Hard Copy who had heard about the extraordinary return of 16-year-old Nicholas Barclay and wanted to hire Parker to help investigate the kidnapping. He agreed to take the job. After Parker spoke with the Hard Copy producer, he easily traced Nicholas Barclay to Carey and Bryan's trailer. On 6 November, Parker arrived there with a producer and a camera crew. The family didn't want Bourdin to speak to reporters. 'I'm a very private person,' Carey says. But Bourdin, who had been in the country for nearly three weeks, agreed to talk. 'I wanted the attention at the time,' he says. 'It was a psychological need. Today I wouldn't do it.'</p> <p>Parker stood off to one side, listening intently as the young man relayed his harrowing story. 'He was calm as a cucumber,' Parker told me. 'No looking down, no body language. None.' But Parker was puzzled by his curious accent.</p> <p>Parker spied a photograph on a shelf of Nicholas Barclay as a young boy, and kept looking at it and at the person in front of him, thinking that something was amiss. Having once read that ears are distinct, like fingerprints, he went up to the cameraman and whispered: 'Zoom in on his ears. Get 'em as close as you can.'</p> <p>Parker slipped the photograph of Nicholas Barclay into his pocket, and after the interview he hurried back to his office and used a scanner to transfer the photo to his computer; he then studied video from the Hard Copy interview. Parker zoomed in on both pictures. 'The ears were close but they didn't match,' he says.</p> <p>Parker called several ophthalmologists and asked if eyes could be changed from blue to brown by injecting chemicals. The doctors said no. Parker also phoned a dialect expert at Trinity University, in San Antonio, who told him that even if someone had been held in captivity for three years, he would quickly regain his native accent.</p> <p>Parker passed on his suspicions to authorities, even though the San Antonio police had declared that 'the boy who came back claiming to be Nicholas Barclay is Nicholas Barclay'. Fearing that a dangerous stranger was living with Nicholas's family, Parker phoned Beverly and told her what he had discovered. As he recalls the conversation, he said: 'It's not him, ma'am. It's not him.'</p> <p>'What do you mean, it's not him?' she asked.</p> <p>Parker explained about the ears and the eyes and the accent. In his files, Parker wrote: 'Family is upset but maintains that they believe it is their son.'</p> <p>Parker says that a few days later he received an angry call from Bourdin. Although Bourdin denies he made the call, Parker noted in his file at the time that Bourdin said: 'Who do you think you are?' When Parker replied that he didn't believe he was Nicholas, Bourdin shot back: 'Immigration thinks it's me. The family thinks it's me.'</p> <p>Parker wondered if he should let the matter go. He had tipped off authorities and was no longer under contract to investigate the matter. He had other cases piling up. And he figured that a mother would know her own son. Still, the boy's accent sounded French, maybe French Moroccan. If so, what was a foreigner doing infiltrating a trailer home in the backwoods of Texas? 'I thought he was a terrorist, I swear to God,' Parker says.</p> <p>Beverly rented a small room in a run-down apartment complex in San Antonio, and Parker started to follow Bourdin when he visited her. 'I'd set up on the apartment and watch him come out,' Parker says. 'He'd walk all the way to the bus stop wearing his Walkman and doing his Michael Jackson moves.'</p> <p>Bourdin was struggling to stay in character. He found living with Carey and Beverly 'claustrophobic' and was happiest when he was outside, wandering the streets. 'I was not used to being in someone else's family, to live with them like I'm one of theirs,' he says. 'I wasn't ready for it.' One day, Carey and the family presented him with a cardboard box. Inside were Nicholas's baseball cards, records and various mementos. He picked up each item, gingerly. There was a letter from one of Nicholas's girlfriends. As he read it, he said to himself: 'I'm not this boy.'</p> <p>After two months in the United States, Bourdin started to come apart. He was moody and aloof - 'weirding out', as Codey put it. He stopped attending classes and was consequently suspended. In December he took off in Bryan and Carey's car and drove to Oklahoma, with the windows down, listening to Michael Jackson's song 'Scream': 'Tired of the schemes / The lies are disgusting... / Somebody please have mercy / 'Cause I just can't take it'. The police pulled him over for speeding, and he was arrested. Beverly, Carey and Bryan picked him up at the police station and brought him home.</p> <p>According to his real mother, Ghislaine, Bourdin called her in Europe. For all his disagreements with his mother, Bourdin still seemed to long for her. (He once wrote her a letter, saying, 'I don't want to lose you... If you disappear then I disappear.') Ghislaine says Bourdin confided that he was living with a woman in Texas who believed that he was her son. She became so upset that she hung up.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas, Bourdin went into the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror - at his brown eyes, his dyed hair. He grabbed a razor and began to mutilate his face. He was put in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital for several days of observation. Later Bourdin wrote in a notebook: 'When you fight monsters, be careful that in the process you do not become one.' He also jotted down a poem: 'My days are phantom days, each one the shadow of a hope; / My real life never was begun, / Nor any of my real deeds done'.</p> <p>Doctors judged Bourdin to be stable enough to return to Carey's trailer. But he remained disquieted and increasingly wondered what had happened to the real Nicholas Barclay. So did Parker, who, while trying to identify Bourdin, had started to gather information and interview Nicholas's neighbours. At the time that Nicholas disappeared, he was living with Beverly in a small one-storey house in San Antonio. Nicholas's half-brother, Jason, who was then 24, had recently moved in with them after living for a period with his cousin in Utah. Jason was wiry and strong, with long brown curly hair and a comb often tucked in the back pocket of his jeans. He had burn marks on his body and face: at 13 he had lit a cigarette after filling a lawn mower with gasoline and accidentally set himself on fire. Because of his scars, Carey says, 'Jason worried he would never meet somebody and he would always be alone'. He strummed Lynyrd Skynyrd songs on his guitar and was a capable artist who sketched portraits of friends. Though he had only completed high school, he was bright and articulate. He also had an addictive personality, like his mother, often drinking heavily and using cocaine. He had his 'demons', as Carey put it.</p> <p>On 13 June 1994, Beverly and Jason told police that Nicholas had been playing basketball three days earlier and called his house from a pay phone, wanting a ride home. Beverly was sleeping, so Jason answered the phone. He told Nicholas to walk home. Nicholas never made it. Because Nicholas had recently fought with his mother over the trainers he had stolen, and over the possibility of being sent to a home for juveniles, the police initially thought that he had a run away - even though he hadn't taken any money or possessions.</p> <p>Parker was surprised by police reports showing that after Nicholas's disappearance there were several disturbances at Beverly's house. On 12 July she called the police, though when an officer arrived she insisted she was all right. Jason told the officer that his mother was 'drinking and screaming at him because her other son ran away'. A few weeks later, Beverly called the police again, about what authorities described as 'family violence'. The officer on the scene reported that Beverly and Jason were 'exchanging words'; Jason was asked to leave the house for the day, and he complied. On 25 September, police received another call, this time from Jason. He claimed his younger brother had returned and tried to break into the garage, fleeing when Jason spotted him. In his report, the officer on duty said that he had 'checked the area' for Nicholas, but was 'unable to locate him'.</p> <p>Jason's behaviour grew even more erratic. He was arrested for 'using force' against a police officer, and Beverly kicked him out of the house. Nicholas's disappearance, Codey told me, had 'messed Jason up pretty bad. He went on a bad drug binge and was shooting cocaine for a long time.' Because he had refused to help Nicholas get a ride home on the day he vanished, Chantel says, Jason had 'a lot of guilt'.</p> <p>In late 1996 Jason checked into a rehabilitation centre and weaned himself off drugs. After he finished the programme, he remained at the facility for more than a year, serving as a counsellor and working for a landscaping business that the centre operated. He was still there when Bourdin turned up, claiming to be his missing brother.</p> <p>Bourdin wondered why Jason had not met him at the airport and had initially made no effort to see him at Carey's. After a month-and-a-half, Bourdin and family members say, Jason finally came for a visit. Even then, Codey says, 'Jason was standoffish.' Though Jason gave him a hug in front of the others, Bourdin says, he seemed to eye him warily. After a few minutes, Jason told him to come outside, and held out his hand to Bourdin. A necklace with a gold cross glittered in his palm. Jason said that it was for him. 'It was like he had to give it to me,' Bourdin says. Jason put it around his neck. Then he said goodbye, and never returned.</p> <p>Bourdin told me: 'It was clear that Jason knew what had happened to Nicholas.' For the first time, Bourdin began to wonder who was conning who.</p> <p>The authorities, meanwhile, had started to doubt Bourdin's story. Nancy Fisher, who at the time was a veteran FBI agent, had interviewed Bourdin several weeks after he arrived in the United States in order to document his allegations of being kidnapped on American soil. Immediately, she told me, she 'smelled a rat'. 'His hair was dark but bleached blond and the roots were quite obvious.'</p> <p>Parker knew Fisher and had shared with her his own suspicions. Fisher warned Parker not to interfere with a federal probe, but as they conducted parallel investigations they developed a sense of trust, and Parker passed on any information he obtained. When Fisher made inquiries into who may have abducted Nicholas and sexually abused him, she says, she found Beverly oddly 'surly and uncooperative'.</p> <p>Fisher wondered whether Beverly and her family simply wanted to believe that Bourdin was their loved one. Whatever the family's motivations, Fisher's main concern was the mysterious figure who had entered the United States. She knew it was impossible for him to have altered his eye colour. In November, under the pretext of getting Bourdin treatment for his alleged abuse, Fisher took him to see a forensic psychiatrist in Houston, who concluded from his syntax and grammar that he could not be American and was most likely French or Spanish. The FBI shared the results with Beverly and Carey, Fisher says, but they insisted he was Nicholas.</p> <p>Believing Bourdin was a spy, Fisher says, she contacted the Central Intelligence Agency, explaining the potential threat and asking for help in identifying him. 'The CIA wouldn't assist me,' she says. 'I was told by a CIA agent that until you can prove he's European we can't help you.'</p> <p>Fisher tried to persuade Beverly and Bourdin to give blood samples for a DNA test. Both refused. 'Beverly said: \"How dare you say he's not my son,\"' Fisher recalls. In the middle of February, four months after Bourdin arrived in the United States, Fisher obtained warrants to force them to cooperate.</p> <p>'I go to her house to get a blood sample, and she lies on the floor and says she's not going to get up,' Fisher says. 'I said, \"Yes, you are.\"'</p> <p>'Beverly defended me,' Bourdin says. 'She tried to stop them.'</p> <p>Along with their blood, Fisher obtained Bourdin's fingerprints, which she sent to the State Department to see if there was a match with Interpol.</p> <p>Carey, worried about her supposed brother's self-mutilation and instability, was no longer willing to let him stay with her, and he went to live with Beverly in her apartment. By then, Bourdin claims, he looked at the family differently. One time when he was staying with her, Bourdin alleges, she got drunk and screamed: 'I know that God punished me by sending you to me. I don't know who the hell you are. Why the fuck are you doing this?'</p> <p>On 5 March 1998, with the authorities closing in on Bourdin, Beverly called Parker and said she believed Bourdin was an impostor. The next morning, Parker took him to a diner. </p> <p>'I raise my trousers so he can see I'm not wearing a gun [in his ankle holster],' Parker says. 'I want him to relax.'</p> <p>They ordered pancakes. After nearly five months of pretending to be Nicholas Barclay, Bourdin says, he was psychically frayed. According to Parker, when he told 'Nicholas' that he had upset his 'mother', the young man blurted out: 'She's not my mother, and you know it.'</p> <p>'You gonna tell me who you are?'</p> <p>'I'm Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin and I'm wanted by Interpol.'</p> <p>After a few minutes, Parker went to the men's room and called Nancy Fisher with the news. She had just received the same information from Interpol. 'We're trying to get a warrant right now,' she told Parker. 'Stall him.'</p> <p>Parker went back to the table and continued to talk to Bourdin. As Bourdin spoke about his itinerant life in Europe, Parker says, he felt some guilt for turning him in. Bourdin, who despises Parker and disputes the details of their conversation, accuses the detective of 'pretending' to have solved the case; it was as if Parker had intruded into Bourdin's interior fiction and given himself a starring role. After about an hour, Parker drove Bourdin back to Beverly's apartment. As Parker was pulling away, Fisher and the authorities were already descending on him. He surrendered quietly. 'I knew I was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin again,' he says. Beverly reacted less calmly. She turned and yelled at Fisher: 'What took you so long?'</p> <p>In custody, Bourdin told a story that seemed as fanciful as his tale of being Nicholas Barclay. He alleged that Beverly and Jason might have been complicit in Nicholas's disappearance, and that they had known from the outset that Bourdin was lying. 'I'm a good impostor, but I'm not that good,' Bourdin told me.</p> <p>Of course, the authorities could not rely on the account of a pathological liar. 'He tells 99 lies and maybe the 100th is the truth, but you don't know,' Fisher says. Yet the authorities had their own suspicions. Jack Stick, who was a federal prosecutor at the time, was assigned to Bourdin's case. 'I wanted to know what had happened to that little kid,' Stick recalls.</p> <p>Stick and Fisher gathered more evidence suggesting that Beverly's home was prone to violence. They found that officials at Nicholas's school had expressed concern that Nicholas might be an abused child, owing to bruises on his body.</p> <p>One day Fisher asked Beverly to take a polygraph. Carey recalls, 'I said: \"Mom, do whatever they ask you to do. Go take the lie-detector test. You didn't kill Nicholas.\" So she did.' While Beverly was taking the polygraph, Fisher watched the proceedings on a video monitor. The most important question was whether Beverly currently knew the whereabouts of Nicholas. She said no, twice. The polygraph examiner told Fisher that Beverly had seemingly answered truthfully. When Fisher expressed disbelief, the examiner said that if Beverly was lying, she had to be on drugs. After a while, the examiner administered the test again, at which point the effects of any possible narcotics, including methadone, might have worn off. This time, when the examiner asked if Beverly knew Nicholas's whereabouts, Fisher says, the machine went wild, indicating a lie. 'She blew the instruments practically off the table.'</p> <p>When the examiner told Beverly she had failed the exam and began pressing her with more questions, Beverly yelled: 'I don't have to put up with this,' then got up and ran out the door. 'I catch her,' Fisher recalls. 'I say, \"Why are you running?\" She is furious. She says, \"This is so typical of Nicholas. Look at the hell he's putting me through.\"'</p> <p>Fisher next wanted to interview Jason, but he resisted. When he finally agreed to meet her, several weeks after Bourdin had been arrested, Fisher says, she had to 'pull words out of him'. They spoke about the fact that he had not gone to see his alleged brother for nearly two months: 'I said, \"Here's your brother, long gone, kidnapped, and aren't you eager to see him?\" He said, \"Well, no.\" I said, \"Did he look like your brother to you?\" \"Well, I guess.\"' Fisher found his responses grudging, and developed a 'very strong suspicion that Jason had participated in the disappearance of his brother'. Stick, too, believed that Jason either had been 'involved in Nicholas's disappearance or had information that could tell us what had happened'. Fisher even suspected that Beverly knew what had happened to Nicholas and might have helped cover up the crime in order to protect Jason.</p> <p>After the interview, Jason refused to speak to the authorities again without a lawyer or unless he was under arrest. But Parker, who as a private investigator was not bound by the same legal restrictions as Stick and Fisher, continued to press Jason. On one occasion, he accused him of murder. 'I think you did it,' Parker says he told him. 'I don't think you meant to do it, but you did.' In response, Parker says Jason 'just looked at me'.</p> <p>Several weeks after Fisher and Parker questioned Jason, Parker was driving through downtown San Antonio and saw Beverly on the sidewalk. He asked her if she wanted a ride. When she got in, she told him that Jason had died of an overdose of cocaine. Parker, who knew that Jason had been off drugs for more than a year, says that he asked if she thought he had taken his life on purpose. She said, 'I don't know.'</p> <p>Since the loss of her sons, Beverly has stopped using drugs and moved out to Spring Branch, where she lives in a trailer, helping a woman care for her severely handicapped daughter. Recently she agreed to talk with me about the authorities' suspicions. At first Beverly said I could drive out to meet her, but later she told me that the woman she worked for did not want visitors, so we spoke by phone. One of her vocal cords had recently become paralysed, deepening her already low and gravelly voice. Parker, who had frequently chatted with her at the doughnut shop, had told me: 'I don't know why I liked her, but I did. She looked like someone whose life had taken everything out of her.'</p> <p>Beverly answered my questions forthrightly. At the airport, she said, she had hung back because Bourdin 'looked odd'. She added, 'If I went with my gut, I would have known right away.' She admitted she had taken drugs - 'probably' heroin, methadone and alcohol - before the polygraph exam. 'When they accused me, I freaked out,' she said. 'I worked my ass off to raise my kids. Why would I do something to my kids?' She continued: 'I'm not a violent person. They didn't talk to any of my friends or associates... It was just a shot in the dark, to see if I'd admit something.' She also said of herself: 'I'm the world's worst liar. I can't lie worth crap.'</p> <p>I asked her if Jason had hurt Nicholas. She paused for a moment, then said that she didn't think so. She acknowledged that when Jason did cocaine he became 'totally wacko - a completely different person - and it was scary'. He even beat up his father once, she said. But she noted that Jason had not been a serious addict until after Nicholas disappeared. </p> <p>As we spoke, I asked several times how she could have believed for nearly five months that a 23-year-old Frenchman with dyed hair, brown eyes and a European accent was her son. 'We just kept making excuses - that he's different because of all this ugly stuff that had happened,' she said. She and Carey wanted it to be him so badly. It was only after he came to live with her that she had doubts. 'He just didn't act like my son,' Beverly said. 'I couldn't bond with him. I just didn't have that feeling. My heart went out for him, but not like a mother's would. The kid's a mess and it's sad, and I wouldn't wish that on anybody.'</p> <p>Beverly's experience, as incredible as it is, does have a precursor - an incident that has been described as one of 'the strangest cases in the annals of police history'. (It is the basis of a Clint Eastwood movie, Changeling, which will be released in the UK in November.) On 10 March 1928, a nine-year-old boy named Walter Collins disappeared in Los Angeles. Six months later, after a nationwide manhunt, a boy showed up claiming that he was Walter and insisting he had been kidnapped. The police were certain he was Walter, and a family friend testified that 'things the boy said and did would convince anybody' that he was the missing child. When Walter's mother, Christine, went to retrieve her son, however, she did not think it was him. Although the authorities and friends persuaded her to take him home, she brought the boy back to a police station after a few days, insisting: 'This is not my son.' She later testified, 'His teeth were different, his voice was different... His ears were smaller.' The authorities thought that she must be suffering emotional distress from her son's disappearance, and had her institutionalised in a psychiatric ward. Even then, she refused to budge. As she told a police captain, 'One thing a mother ought to know was the identity of her child.' Eight days later, she was released. Evidence soon emerged that her son was likely murdered by a serial killer, and the boy claiming to be her son confessed that he was an 11-year-old runaway from Iowa who, in his words, thought that it was 'fun to be somebody you aren't'.</p> <p>After several months of investigation, Stick determined that there was no evidence to charge anyone with Nicholas's disappearance. There were no witnesses, no DNA. Authorities could not even say whether Nicholas was dead. Stick concluded Jason's overdose had all but 'precluded the possibility' that authorities could determine what had happened to Nicholas.</p> <p>On 9 September 1998, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin stood in a San Antonio courtroom and pleaded guilty to perjury, and to obtaining and possessing false documents. This time, his claim that he was merely seeking love elicited outrage. Carey, who had a nervous breakdown after Bourdin was arrested, testified before his sentencing, saying: 'He has lied, and lied, and lied again. And to this day he continues to lie. He bears no remorse.' Stick denounced Bourdin as a 'flesh-eating bacteria', and the judge compared what Bourdin had done - giving a family the hope that their lost child was alive and then shattering it - to murder.</p> <p>The judge sentenced Bourdin to six years - more than three times what was recommended under the sentencing guidelines. Bourdin told the courtroom: 'I apologise to all the people in my past, for what I have done. I wish, I wish that you believe me, but I know it's impossible.' Whether he was in jail or not, he added, 'I am a prisoner of myself.'</p> <p>When I last saw Bourdin, this spring, his life had undergone perhaps its most dramatic transformation. He had married a Frenchwoman, Isabelle, whom he had met two years earlier. In her late twenties, Isabelle was slim and pretty and soft-spoken. She was studying to be a lawyer. A victim of family abuse, she had seen Bourdin on television, describing his own abuse and his quest for love, and she had been so moved that she eventually tracked him down. </p> <p>Bourdin says that when Isabelle first approached him he thought it must be a joke, but they met in Paris and gradually fell in love. He said he had never been in a relationship before. 'I've always been a wall,' he said. 'A cold wall.' On 8 August 2007, after a year of courtship, they married at the town hall of a village outside Pau. Bourdin's mother says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric invited her and his grandfather to the ceremony, but they didn't go. 'No one believed him,' she says.</p> <p>When I met them last, Isabelle was nearly eight months pregnant. At one point, Bourdin touched her stomach. 'My baby can have three arms and three legs,' he said. 'It doesn't matter. I don't need my child to be perfect. All I want is that this child feels love.' A month later, Bourdin called and told me his wife had given birth. </p> <p>'It's a girl,' he said. He and Isabelle had named her Athena, for the Greek goddess. 'I'm really a father,' he said. </p> <p>I asked if he had become a new person. For a moment, he fell silent. Then he said: 'No, this is who I am.'</p> <p>\u2022 \"The Chameleon\" \u00a9 2008 by David Grann. This article was originally printed in The New Yorker, August 11 &amp; 18 2008 issue.

  "<p>It used to be called Stinky Town - a smoke-belching, coal-burning industrial powerhouse in what was once the heart of East Germany. But the old folk of Spremberg no longer have to check which way the wind is blowing before venturing outside. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Spremberg, or 'Stink-Stadt', made history. It is now host to the world's first power plant that collects emissions from coal burning and pipes them deep underground. Built by Swedish power firm Vattenfall, it emits up to 90 per cent less carbon dioxide than a conventional facility. The process it employs, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is seen by a growing coalition of power companies, financiers, academics - and even campaign groups including Greenpeace and WWF - as the silver bullet in the fight against climate change.</p> <p>Regarded as the best the way to secure affordable electricity without polluting the atmosphere, CCS could also facilitate the return in the UK of a new era for coal, a 'dirty' fossil fuel whose fate had seemed sealed. </p> <p>The next 10 days will determine if CCS, which is expensive and still unproven, has a future. A vote in the European parliament will decide whether the first 12 demonstration projects receive a \u20ac12bn (\u00a39.5bn) subsidy. Failure to reach agreement - and Europe is split over the proposal - will mean a delay of at least two years while the search goes on for alternative funding mechanisms. </p> <p>On Tuesday of next week, members of the European environment committee will consider an amendment by Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who is seen as the champion of the CCS movement in Europe. Davies's powerful lobbying has successfully short-circuited the legislative process. If his amendment is passed, he has been given permission to take it directly to EU president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and the Council of Ministers - the environment ministers of the 27 European member states - for rubber-stamping early next year.</p> <p>The Davies amendment is part of legislation aiming to reconfigure Europe's emissions trading scheme. Davies has inserted a clause that would allow firms building CCS power plants to sell carbon allowances via the scheme, on condition that the new plants actually work and succeed in burying CO2</p> <p>Power firms would be paid the \u20ac12bn subsidy retrospectively. The first wave of CCS plants will cost about \u20ac1bn more than equivalent conventional power stations. Davies argues, however, that CCS will ultimately be cost-effective, although only once the knowledge gleaned from the demonstration projects is shared and refined to allow economies of scale to kick in. Supporters are encouraged by a report published last week by management consultants McKinsey that backed his case.</p> <p>More than 60 coal-fired power stations could be built across Europe if CCS takes off, and a number are planned for the UK. John Hutton, Labour's Business Secretary, told the party conference in Manchester last Monday that he would take on critics of new coal and nuclear power stations, arguing that their construction was vital to securing Britain's long-term energy needs. </p> <p>But last week the influential UK Environment Agency warned that on no account should coal-fired stations get the go-ahead until CCS is a proven technology, because otherwise the increased CO2 they produce would be devastating. It is understood that the cabinet is split on allowing Eon to build a coal-fired station at Kingsnorth in Kent that will be 'CCS-ready', but which is not conceived from the start as a CCS facility.</p> <p>Davies acknowledges this concern and has inserted another amendment in the legislation that will mean the closure of 'dirty' power stations across Europe, with only those emitting less than 500g of CO2 every kilowatt hour being allowed. Really dirty stations emit almost three times that figure.</p> <p>Until recently, Davies's plan appeared to have little chance of passing through the European parliament: opposition from accession countries led by Poland looked to have defeated the measures. But in recent weeks the tide has turned. There is now a chance the 60 members of the committee will approve the package, seeing it as a way of meeting medium-term emissions targets. Europe has set itself a CO2 reduction target of 20 per cent by 2020 and 60 to 80 per cent by 2050. Successful CCS could slash European CO2 emission by 20 per cent.</p> <p>There are global implications for the MEPs' decision. If Europe cannot reach agreement, it will enter international climate change talks in Copenhagen designed to replace the Kyoto Protocol with no sign that it is taking a lead on the issue. Without a European CCS funding commitment, it has been suggested that it will prove difficult to persuade China to act on climate change and other countries to act on deforestation. </p> <p>In addition, European parliamentary elections next year will slow down any EU agreements on new CCS projects. </p> <p>Ian Temperton of investment firm Climate Change Capital, says: 'Money is absolutely needed. These programmes won't happen without support. We are effectively already in the middle of the next decade in terms of the lead time for getting these plants up and running. If we don't modify existing legislation we will miss the opportunity. If we want to demonstrate that Europe is able to show the world leadership in the most difficult energy area, this is something we have to do.'</p> <p>Developing CCS has created a Europe-wide alliance of power firms. A new body in Brussels known as the Zero Emissions Platform is attempting to secure next week's vote. Members of the ZEP include BP, Shell, WWF and a range of European firms. Leading the organisation is Dr Graeme Sweeney, who heads Shell's future fuels division. </p> <p>BP and Shell have invested heavily in the controversial Canadian oil sands, which require a more energy-intensive process than conventional oil extraction because hot air and steam are needed to make 'heavy' oil flow into reservoirs. Some suggest that oil sands require double the energy usually needed for production. Shell disputes that, putting the figure at just 15 per cent more. Whatever the truth, the oil giants need to capture their emissions via CCS to offset the higher energy use required for oil-sands exploitation. The same argument applies to many of their natural gas finds. </p> <p>Keith Allott, WWF's climate change adviser, says: 'Potentially, CCS can play a significant role in moving away from a disastrous high-carbon future. We're seeing new proposals for new coal-fired power stations in the UK and Europe. Europe needs to show leadership and this is why we need to fund well-focused demonstration projects.'</p> <p>Next week, we will know whether his wish has been granted.</p> <h2>Fossils still alive</h2> <p>The International Energy Agency says that global electricity production will nearly double by 2030. Even with increased reliance on renewables and investment in energy efficiency, fossil fuels are likely to remain at around 65 per cent of the total energy mix for decades. </p> <p>The world is returning to coal as demand for electricity increases. In China, a new coal-fired power station opens every other week. Today, 40 per cent of the world's electricity comes from coal, with a fair chance of that share increasing. Unless CCS can be successfully deployed, many experts regard this as a nightmare scenario.</p>",
  "<p>There is a simple reason why US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's $700bn bail-out package has been so hard to sell to politicians and the American people: it won't really work. Despite the historically massive expenditure and all the little clauses to make sure Wall Street fat cats get their comeuppance, the plan is unlikely to do anything to save the world's biggest economy from a long and crippling downturn.</p> <p>It will doubtless save some banks from collapse, but is that worth the government putting itself on the hook for nearly a trillion dollars - more than $3,000 for every man, woman and child in America? And that's not the half of it. Not bailing out Wall Street - with as much money as it would take to launch an American National Health Service - presents an even bleaker prospect: a financial nuclear winter that could last a generation. In short, America is doomed if it does and even more doomed if it doesn't get Paulson's billions, perhaps the ugliest economic choice it has ever faced.</p> <p>You can always rely on 'Neutron Jack' Welch, the former GE boss and all-round tough talker, to tell it how it is. 'I now believe we are in for one hell of a deep downturn,' he told the World Business Forum in New York last Wednesday, adding that the first quarter of 2009 will be 'brutal'.</p> <p>Until recently, Welch said, he had believed the American economy could avoid recession, but he has changed his mind, despite the bail-out. 'I am now caving,' he said. 'Get ready for real tough times. They're coming.'</p> <p>Welch is not alone in his gloomy outlook. A day after the New York meeting, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the German finance minister, predicted America will soon be knocked off its perch as the world's leading economic superpower.</p> <p>If you peel away this hyperbole, however, and consider the ramifications of such large-scale government intervention into the market as Paulson's bail-out represents, even Steinbr\u00fcck's seemingly gratuitous slight sounds plausible.</p> <p>The first question anyone thinking about the bail-out should surely ask is whether $700bn is enough, or indeed too much, to fix things. And where did that figure come from? David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York credit rating agency, suggests that all the 'level 3' assets of all the biggest financial firms on Wall Street adds up to about $630bn. But this valuation is arbitrary at best, seeing as these sub-prime or toxic securities are only really worth what the market - or in this case the US Treasury Department - is willing to pay for them.</p> <p>'I think the biggest risk to the financial system is if it turns out to be not enough,' says Barry Bosworth, a former economic adviser to President Carter and a senior economist at The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning Washington think-tank.</p> <p>It is impossible to know how much money will be needed to mop up all of America's sub-prime- related securitised debt because we don't yet know how the Treasury intends to go about buying it. 'There is so little agreement on this point - on whether it should be a traditional auction or a reverse auction or some other process - that the whole structure could very well fracture,' Bosworth says. 'There is not enough detail.' </p> <p>And the seemingly flawed mechanics of the bail-out are just the tip of the iceberg. Assuming the plan actually gets off the ground and the Treasury is able to organise some kind of workable asset sale, what will happen to the US economy once the banks have been 'saved'? Will house prices automatically start to stabilise? Will jobs be created as if by magic? Will Americans suddenly find they have disposable income on hand to get their consumer-weighted economy whirring away again? Of course not.</p> <p>And that is the plan's biggest flaw. 'My biggest fear is that all of this money, and it really is a very large amount, is going to be spent and none of it will be used to stimulate the economy,' Bosworth says.</p> <p>In fact it is entirely possible that the economy will become even more paralysed after the bail-out than it is today, because the government will put such a strain on the already-creaking public finances that it will not be in a position to provide any sort of stimulus for a long time to come. America will be unable to spend its way out of this crisis.</p> <p>Most critics of Paulson's plan express concern over US taxpayers shelling out billions of dollars to bail out greedy Wall Street bankers, but this is a misconception. Taxpayers, who have been shocked by the scale of earnings of all-too-fallible 'masters of the universe' such as Lehman Brothers' Dick Fuld and Bear Stearns' Jimmy Cayne (see panel) are not directly paying for this; nor will they ever, because America does not have $700bn of taxpayers' money. The government is in debt to the tune of $9.8 trillion. The entire sum will probably be borrowed from foreign governments and other purchasers of US Treasury bonds - which creates further problems.</p> <p>'Borrowing every penny of this $700bn could have very serious consequences,' Bosworth says. 'Firstly, investors from other countries are going to see this as the biggest example yet of America's lack of financial discipline. They may then very well decide they should not invest so heavily here and diversify their portfolios to invest less in US Treasuries, dollars and US equities and more in European bonds and the euro.'</p> <p>This, of course, will drive the already weakened dollar down even further, which will not only suck more lifeblood out of the American economy but drive up the dollar-denominated price of oil and other commodities, adding inflationary pressure into the bargain. Talk about kicking a country while it is down.</p> <p>Vincent Reinhart is a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank normally the antithesis of Brookings and its liberal scholars. He is in a particularly good position to criticise Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's latest work because he worked for the Federal Reserve for more than 25 years, much of it as a director on the monetary affairs board.</p> <p>On the subject of the bail-out, however, he agrees almost entirely with Bosworth. In fact he goes even further, suggesting that what has been dubbed 'Tarp' (the Troubled Asset Relief Programme) will all but cripple whoever wins the presidential election in November.</p> <p>'Who would want to be President and inherit this mess?' Reinhart asks, adding that most of the big decisions in the victor's entire four-year term will be made by the Bush administration before inauguration day in January. 'The whole four years will likely be bogged down in very dull financial regulation and legislation relating to this bill.'</p> <p>What is more, with such immense pressure on public finances from the size of the debt incurred to fund it, Barack Obama can forget about spending increases and John McCain won't have any room for tax cuts. So whoever wins will be unable to fulfil many of their manifesto pledges.</p> <p>The next President will also face the prospect of a global depression to manage, and with it the possibility of strained relations with foreign governments.</p> <p>China, so dependent on the US as top buyer of its manufactured goods, faces an abrupt slowdown as Americans tighten their belts. This of course will mean that China and other nations will be less able to purchase huge wads of US Treasuries even if they wanted to, further restricting America's access to funds. 'It certainly will change our relationship with our trading partners,' Reinhart says.</p> <p>It is almost as if Paulson and Bernanke have created a plan that will see them through the next few months without concern for the long-term effects of their actions. 'I regard this as nothing more than a stopgap measure to get us through the election,' says S&amp;P's Wyss.</p> <p>After the Latin American financial crisis in the 1980s, the leading countries of Asia and the Pacific Rim said such a collapse could never happen to them. But in just a few years their economies were falling like dominoes.</p> <p>And as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were failing, Americans looked on and observed that such endemic economic troubles only happened in developing economies such as Asia and Latin America, and could never happen in their great nation. They were wrong.</p>",
  "<p>When police burst into a house near Hanover airport on Thursday night, they confronted a woman who screamed when she saw them but was too exhausted to get to her guns or even to struggle very hard.</p> <p>With the capture of Ulrike Marie Meinhof, West Germany has caught the woman officially named 'Public Enemy No. 1'.</p> <p>The so-called 'Baader-Meinhof Band' of urban guerrillas seems to have been destroyed at last.</p> <p>Earlier this month, police firing submachine guns and supported by a military armoured car surrounded a house in Frankfurt. After a gun battle they captured four men. One of them, writhing in pain from a wound, was Andreas Baader.</p> <p>The group, which calls itself the 'Red Army Faction' has been waging war on West German established society for three years. At one time 150,000 policemen were looking for them. </p> <p>Ulrike Meinhof, a handsome, shy woman of 38 who is the mother of twins, had become a myth in West Germany. Some even believed that she was dead and that a coffin recently burned in Hamburg crematorium contained her remains (it certainly did not contain the person whose name was on the lid).</p> <p>Every day citizens telephoned the police to say that they had seen her: leaving a deserted summerhouse in the grey light of dawn, driving through Berlin in a stolen sports car, crossing a frontier guarded by a squad of young girls armed with Beretta pistols.</p> <p>She was an unlikely person to lead such a band, to inspire the bank raids, gun battles and bombings of police headquarters and American installations. But the group, like the 'Tragic Band' of anarchists who fought society all the way to the guillotine in pre-1914 Paris, was composed of exceptionally resourceful and intelligent men and women, many from the universities. Many were young girls: the 'Red Army' attracted those who believed that their disadvantages as women could not be overcome without the overthrow of capitalism, and that the system could be challenged only by force.</p> <p>Ulrike began as an idealistic nuclear disarmer. In the early sixties, tougher left-wingers despised her pacifism. 'They say I am a peace-peddling egg pancake,' she told me helplessly.</p> <p>In those days she was editing the left-wing magazine Konkret in Hamburg, with her husband, Klaus Rohl. Her foster-mother was Renato Riemeck, a remarkable woman who in the fifties had supported nuclear disarmament at a time when such ideas were denounced as crypto-Communist. But in Ulrike's ideas then there were already seeds of her future despair.</p> <p>Under the glossy surface of the 'Economic Miracle', she saw accumulating a layer of desperately poor and backward social drop-outs whose children stood no chance of escaping their poverty. She described to me hutments inhabited by three generations already, most of whose children went to remedial schools or none.</p> <p>No party and no paper, she said, would fight for those children. 'People like me aren't dangerous,' she said bitterly, 'as long as we can't make contact with the workers. And we have no means of communication.'</p> <p>This worry stayed with her. When her husband turned Konkret into a big-circulation magazine by interleaving nudes with the political articles, she left him and moved to West Berlin. She absorbed the Marxist ideas of the student movement there, led by men like Rudi Dutschke and Christian Semmler. But, working with a community of her 'problem' working-class girls, she came to believe that even they were not radical enough. Only the example of revolutionary armed struggle would break down the indifference of the working class.</p> <p>In early 1968, Andreas Baader and several companions tried to burn down two stores in Frankfurt to give the burghers 'that Vietnam feeling'. He and Ulrike came together. The first exploits of the 'Red Army' was to free Baader from prison in a gun battle, in which Ulrike took part. Both of them, with a group of friends, escaped to the Middle East, took some guerrilla training with the Palestinian National Liberation Front and returned secretly to Germany.</p> <p>'Since then, the 'Red Army' has been at war. In many leaflets and messages, Ulrike Meinhof has tried to explain what she seeks. 'Urban guerrilla tactics' she said recently, 'are the revolutionary method for generally weak revolutionary forces...an armed group, however small, has better chances of transforming itself into a great people's army than a group which merely preaches revolutionary principles.'</p>",
  "<h2>David Puttnam, film producer</h2> <p>Paul Newman was one of my two or three favourite actors when I was growing up. It was pure identity: if you're 15, you're looking for role models and looking for people you can identify with, and he had the beautiful eyes, the eyes I wanted. And he played decent: when you look back at the parts, he played people you wanted to be.</p> <p>He was a terrific actor. All the early films he did were ones that James Dean was contracted to make - that's how he got his breaks. Interestingly, he was screen tested for East of Eden and James Dean got the part. He was continually going after parts that Dean got. When Dean died, Dean's next film was going to be The Left Handed Gun, so Newman was immediately put into that, and that was his big break. </p> <p>I don't think his looks ever got in the way of his acting. He grew old extraordinarily gracefully. He kept his looks but he also kept his integrity. If you can find a vicious thing about Paul Newman in the cuttings I'd be very surprised.</p> <p>For me he was a wholly admirable guy: his marriage, what he did for kids - they still send the Chernobyl kids, funded by Newman, to the west of coast of Ireland. He never was a celeb and I don't remember anything embarrassing. The most terrible thing that ever happened to him of course was the death of his son, which was absolutely devastating for him.</p> <p>I had dinner with him twice. I remember he couldn't have been nicer. He was talking about movies, what a shitty job trying to run a studio was, and how 10 years earlier it was easier to make good movies. </p> <p>For me an era is rapidly drawing to a close. When I lived in LA in the Seventies, these people were accessible and you could talk to them. They really were craftsmen and they would talk about the craft of acting. It's gone because they've ceased to be accessible and as interested as they were in the craft. They were very ordinary people who did something superbly well.</p> <p>Newman absolutely understood the importance of cinema. He was under no illusions at all, it was a very important medium, and therefore what he did as a human being and what he portrayed and the decisions he took were of serious significance. That I do believe is lost.</p> <p>He was a great man, a great loss, a model for any generation of film actors.</p> <p>\u2022 Interview: <strong>David Smith</strong></p> <h2>Michael Winner, film director</h2> <p>'The great thing about Paul Newman was that he looked like the archetypal movie star, so you got a bit of Paul Newman in every performance. With Paul Newman you got the beautiful face, the piercing blue eyes, the smile, the certain devil-may-care attitude - you knew what you were buying. That was the classic old timers' style. That was the Clark Gable style, which doesn't really exist now. But he was also a marvellous actor. For me, Cool Hand Luke was his greatest performance: there was the archetypal outsider, determined to be true to himself against the most awful oppression and unfairness.</p> <p>'I met Paul Newman five or six times in California. He had a life and the quality of a human being that matched his skill as an actor. He was charitable, he was happily married, he was an immense credit to the acting profession and Hollywood. He's been part of my life for ever.'</p> <h2>Newman in quotes</h2> <p><strong>Tom Hanks, 2002</strong><br>'He'd slug me if I was to call him an icon that I was intimidated by. He wouldn't want to hear anything about it. But the fact is, come on, he's Paul Newman. But he's much more than anything you'd expect. He's much more relaxed, unassuming. He gets it. He understands that the biggest job of being an actor, the hardest thing to do is to really capture 45 seconds of truth on film in the course of a long day.' </p> <p><strong>Sidney Lumet, 1994</strong><br>'Paul is a character actor. Leading men's parts, those bore him, as his beauty bores him. Playing the sort of ne'er-do-wells and losers and bums, I think it's a way of saying, \"There's more to me than what I look like.\"' </p> <p><strong>Michael Parkinson</strong><br>'He was the link between the great time of Hollywood, Cary Grant and people like that, and Tom Cruise. He fills the gap between the two, and fills it in a most extraordinary, dominant manner.'</p>",
  "<p>What might have been an invitation to a party ultimately felt like an intrusion on private grief as we joined the few hundred Nottinghamshire romantics sunbathing away the final day of the season in futile expectation of a minor miracle.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as Nottinghamshire thrashed, stumbled and fell well short, all out for 238, in pursuit of an improbable 442 to beat Hampshire and snatch the championship away from Durham, there was no escaping the conclusion they were the architects of their own predicament.</p> <p>This was a game - and a championship - they should have had in their keeping after dismissing Hampshire cheaply in the first innings. They were on their home ground, playing on an unused strip, ludicrously close to the cathedral-window stand (it has no name, apparently), with the best pace attack on the circuit and a vibrancy stoked by their fresh-faced captain, Chris Read.</p> <p>However, it was Read who did much to undermine their efforts when he dropped three of Hampshire's main run-getters on Friday. His batsmen let him down in their first innings, faring little better in the second, and his bowlers were impotent in Hampshire's second, which came to a belated end midway through the morning session yesterday after Liam Dawson secured a century.</p> <p>There were entertaining cameos from Samit Patel, Bilal Shafayat and Read, but there was an inevitability about the ending, all fireworks and no substance.</p> <p>Hampshire deserve credit for playing it hard all the way. Yesterday, Dimitri Mascarenhas was the man in control. He bowled intelligently on a fourth-day wicket that was a bit up-and-down, fiddling out the first three wickets and taking three catches as well.</p> <p>The only time Nottinghamshire looked even remotely like making a fist of their challenge was when Shafayat and Patel put on 96 in mid-innings. They are prodigies of contrasting style and temperament, products of the excellent Nottinghamshire youth system.</p> <p>Patel has broken through first with England as a one-day all-rounder, and Shafayat, the more gifted, is still searching for the sort of consistency he hopes will get him noticed one day.</p> <p>The home side promoted Graeme Swann to open with Will Jefferson and they flickered briefly. Mark Wagh came and went and Ashwell Prince disappointed as the bowlers chipped away with patience and discipline. They were the two qualities missing in Nottinghamshire's cricket at the very time they needed them.</p> <p><strong>LEADING RUN SCORERS</strong></p> <p>1 Martin van Jaarsveld Kent 2197 (2879)</p> <p>2 Marcus Trescothick Somerset 2167 (2829)</p> <p>3 Jacobus Rudolph Yorkshire 2158 (3403)</p> <p>4 Jonathan Trott Warwickshire 2052 (3288)</p> <p>5 Murray Goodwin Sussex 2036 (3187)</p> <p>6 Ravi Bopara Essex 1986 (2404)</p> <p>7 Hylton Ackerman Leicestershire 1965 (2834)</p> <p>8 Vikram Solanki Worcestershire 1939 (2514)</p> <p>9 Joe Denly Kent 1923 (2670)</p> <p>10 Mark Ramprakash Surrey 1776 (3076)</p> <p><strong>LEADING WICKET TAKERS</strong></p> <p>1 Tim Murtagh Middlesex 103</p> <p>2 Stephen Harmison Durham 99</p> <p>3 Yasir Arafat Kent 88</p> <p>4 Ryan McLaren Kent 83</p> <p>5 Graham Wagg Derbyshire 82</p> <p>6 Adil Rashid Yorkshire 81</p> <p>7 Kabir Ali Worcestershire 80</p> <p>8 Charl Langeveldt Derbyshire 79</p> <p>9 Timothy Bresnan Yorkshire 77</p> <p>10 Charlie Shreck Nottinghamshire 76</p> <p><strong>LEADING CATCHERS</strong></p> <p>1 Geraint Jones Kent 93</p> <p>2 Steven Davies Worcestershire 83</p> <p>3 Phil Mustard Durham 81</p> <p>4 James Foster Essex 80</p> <p>5 Paul Nixon Leicestershire 78</p> <p>6 Gerard Brophy Yorkshire 73</p> <p>7 Christopher Read Nottinghamshire 71</p> <p>8 Luke Sutton Lancashire 64</p> <p>9 Craig Kieswetter Somerset 61</p> <p>10 Ben Scott Middlesex 58</p> <p><strong>LEADING SIX HITTERS</strong></p> <p>1 Graham Napier Essex 44</p> <p>2 Marcus Trescothick Somerset 38</p> <p>3 Robert White Northamptonshire 36</p> <p>4 Neil Carter Warwickshire 34</p> <p>5 Ravi Bopara Essex 33</p> <p>6 Eoin Morgan Middlesex 31</p> <p>7 David Sales Northamptonshire 31</p> <p>8 Riki Wessels Northamptonshire 29</p> <p>9 Peter Trego Somerset 28</p> <p>10 Azhar Mahmood Kent 28</p>",
  "<p>Like toothache that refuses to clear up, Celtic's record in Champions League group matches away from home is a persistent, depressing discomfort. Even reports of the club's successes in Europe's premier tournament - such as reaching the last 16 in the past two seasons - are accompanied by the nagging ache of references to the need for improvement on their away results. </p> <p>Gordon Strachan's side will be relieved on Tuesday if they can return unbeaten from the hazardous visit to Villarreal. Having failed to secure a widely expected victory at home to Aalborg in their opening Group E game - a lifeless display in a scoreless draw - a productive trip to Spain is no longer merely desirable, but imperative, if they are to retain a realistic hope of qualifying for the knockout phase. </p> <p>It is also a formidable assignment against opponents whose recent standards make Celtic's objective appear near impossible. Having finished runners-up to Real Madrid in last season's championship (ahead of Barcelona), Villarreal climbed to the top of the league last week, their 2-0 victory over Racing Santander ensuring their best start to a campaign, with 10 points from their opening four games. </p> <p>Squeezed into that impressive run was the 0-0 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford 11 days ago which suggests that they, rather than the current European champions, should be favourites to top the group. </p> <p>Strachan spoke the other day of the strategy he used in close-season tours that brought away victories over Porto and Feyenoord, performances that encouraged the belief that his Celtic are better equipped than at any time to profit from their travels abroad since he succeeded Martin O'Neill three years ago. </p> <p>But a reliance on reprising those performances in Portugal and Holland has undertones of a director staging a final rehearsal two months before opening night. The tactic used involved playing with a lone striker in a 4-5-1 that could quickly be transformed into a 4-3-3 as opportunities to move forward arose. </p> <p>'We tried it in the summer,' said the Celtic manager, 'and it is, in essence, one up front when you're defending, but three up when you switch to attack. That worked well for us and we'll look at the possibility again. But I think everybody by now knows what a good side Villarreal are. They have progressed into a top European force. </p> <p>'When you look through their squad, you see they have top-quality South American players they will have signed for next to nothing and some of whom, no doubt, will be sold on for big money. Because of work permit complications, that is a market we cannot get involved in, but the profits Villarreal make from moving these guys on just makes them stronger for the future. </p> <p>'Obviously, we will have to take into account what they will be trying to do in the game and there will be times when it will be as much about trying to stop Villarreal as it will be about what we are trying to do ourselves. That draw they got at Old Trafford tells you a great deal about their quality. </p> <p>'I think we'll have to be adaptable on the night, but I would say we have players in the squad now who have more variation than we've had in the past - and probably more energy as well. The first-team players here have also gathered a lot of experience, too, and that could be invaluable in a group like this.' </p> <p>Villarreal's cosmopolitan squad - eight nationalities, including the former Arsenal players Robert Pires and Pascal Cygan - under the astute guidance of Chilean coach Manuel Pellegrini - appear powerful enough to impose severe restrictions on Celtic's opportunities to switch to an aggressive 4-3-3. But Strachan is entitled to draw some optimism from the form of Georgios Samaras. </p> <p>The tall Greece forward, having made his initial loan from Manchester City a permanent move in the summer, has looked an immeasurably more effective player in the opening weeks of the season than he did during his intermittent appearances between January and May. His pace, control and scoring rate - nine goals from the six matches preceding yesterday's meeting with Aberdeen - have made his \u00a31.2m transfer fee look like a confidence trick. </p> <p>'Big Sammy's unstoppable at the moment,' said Strachan, 'and when front players get like that, you leave them to get on with it, just let it roll. I'm really pleased for the lad, because he's such a great player to coach. He's a sponge for knowledge, he's only 23 and he just wants to learn more and more.' </p> <p>Strachan must hope that Samaras does not become the latest Celtic player to fall victim to the away curse that has brought 14 defeats and one draw from their five group campaigns.</p>",
  "<p>'Joe Kinnear? You're having a laugh.' In six gleefully delivered words sung during the first half Blackburn fans summed up the prevailing sentiment over Newcastle's temporary appointment of a man who last managed in 2004 when he left Nottingham Forest and has not operated in the Premier League for nine long years. And, it gets worse.</p> <p>The derision felt at Kinnear's almost surreal comeback to the big time was further increased during a bizarre post-match press conference with the new boss. It emerged that contrary to the club's official line, that he would not take charge until tomorrow, he is in fact serving a two-match ban from that last unsuccessful stab at management.</p> <p>'Yeah, it was around two years ago,' Kinnear said, somehow halving the amount of time he's spent away from the game.' I called the referee Coco the Clown - at Rotherham. I asked him what he did in his spare time.'</p> <p>Only Newcastle would employ a second caretaker boss - he replaces the hapless Chris Hughton - who may be out the door before he even makes it to the dugout, because not until the match against Manchester City in three weeks, will Kinnear be allowed to do so. That will make it 25 days since he was given the job and by then, of course, someone somewhere may have taken pity on the club by buying the damn thing.</p> <p>Had owner Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise, the executive director (football) known about the ban? 'No. I don't think so,' Kinnear said. 'I've got one game left. My contract is for six games.' Why six? 'Because the club might be sold after four games. It was a case of four or six games for the contract.'</p> <p>Had he picked the team for what was another disappointing outing and result? 'No. How could I? I only got here on Friday.' What about his relationship with Wise? 'There's been a lot misreported. The last time I spoke to Dennis Wise was two years ago.' And Ashley? 'I don't really know the guy that well.'</p> <p>After several different mentions of there being 'six or seven players missing, which has not helped matters', Kinnear was again honest about why he accepted a role turned down by Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle. 'I won't pussy foot around. I'm not stupid, I know whose footsteps I'm following,' he said of the lamented Kevin Keegan. 'And I know some people have said no. But more fool them. You never get a chance to manage a club like this.'</p> <p>How different, then, is the Premier League since he last managed in it during the 1998-99 season? 'Not much to be honest. There's still some good teams around.' Paul Ince, who confessed himself 'happy with the result but not the performance' from his Blackburn team, may well be building one himself.</p> <p>What he saw was an excellent first half before they faded but it was enough. After 31 minutes Carlos Villanueva floated in a swinging ball and Steven Taylor added to a miserable week - he apologised for the mistake that allowed a Spurs goal here on Wednesday - by failing to stop Christopher Samba getting across him. The big centre-half finished with a header. At the break it was two. Again, as Kinnear noted later, there was suspect defending. This time Argentine central defender Fabricio Coloccini could not deal with a cross from Brett Emerton and Roque Santa Cruz benefited with another header that beat Shay Given.</p> <p>Four minutes into the second half and Newcastle responded. Kinnear said he'd been in the changing room to tell his players 'to stop feeling sorry for themselves'. For a while it worked. Blackburn skipper Ryan Nelson apparently brought down Michael Owen in the area and Steve Tanner gave the penalty that the same player converted.</p> <p>This was the perfect start to the half from United but could they keep it up? The answer was yes, then no. Roared on by the crowd, Geremi - called 'Jeremiah' later by Kinnear - found himself inside the Blackburn area. All the former skipper had to do was control cleanly and there was time to attempt the equaliser. But, the ball fell off his foot and Hughton's fury in the technical area was very obvious.</p> <p>Then, the now former Newcastle manager had even more reason to be frustrated on 74 minutes. Charles N'Zogbia was hurtling with the ball at his feet towards goal when Nelson, who had been booked after the hour, seemed to clatter the French midfielder. Tanner, rather mysteriously, gave an emphatic 'no'. That was followed by an even more indignant expletive from Hughton. It might just become Newcastle United's adopted motto.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT<br></strong><br><strong>David Holmes, Observer reader<br></strong><br>Most of us feel this is some kind of purgatory until we reach the other side, where there may be green pastures. The team vindicate what Keegan said: there's no cover for injuries and we don't have Premier League standard players covering. Ashley is sticking with Xisco. He paid \u00a35.7m but the evidence so far is that he can't head the ball, he has no pace and no vision. The original Cisco kid had a fat companion and he would be better, he was that dreadful. Wise has no eye for a player and the defence is terrible. I'm going to see Status Quo tonight and one of their hits was 'Down Down Deeper and Down' - that's where we're going. Joe Kinnear seems like a nice guy but he's a prototype of Sam Allardyce who will play a long-ball game. People won't tolerate that.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Given 5; Taylor 3, Coloccini 4, Ca\u00e7apa 3, Bassong 3; Geremi 4 (Ameobi 3), N'Zogbia 5 (Edgar 3), Butt 4, Duff 6; Owen 6, Xisco 2<br><strong><br>James Maguire, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>I'm delighted. Tugay was man of the match, while Olsson looked quite comfortable going forward and defensively. I didn't like Ince playing Derbyshire on the left and he kept on giving the ball away. I was glad Santa Cruz scored, but I think we should be playing two strikers, including Roberts. We are playing really nice football, better than under Hughes. I wasn't keen on Ince, but he's settled in and everyone seems confident. Fowler has surprised us, he had a really good first touch when he came on, but it will be hard for him when Benni McCarthy comes back.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Brown 7; Simpson 7, Samba 8, Nelsen 7, Villanueva 6 (Fowler 7); Tugay 9, Warnock 7; Emerton 7, Derbyshire 6 (Ooijer 5), Olsson 8; Santa Cruz 7 (Roberts 5)<br><strong><br><em>To take part in the verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>In August 2003, the body of Anthony Hines, a 37-year-old member of Sydney surf gang the Bra Boys, was found at the bottom of cliffs in the suburb of Maroubra. He was naked except for one shoe and had been shot several times in the head. It could have proved a fiddly case for the New South Wales police - trying to find someone without a motive to kill the violent extortionist - but fellow Bra Boy Jai Abberton, then 29, admitted to the killing almost immediately.</p> <p>Two years before, Hines completed a five-year sentence in the town's Long Bay Correction Complex for rape, during which time he had become convinced that Abberton had slept with his long-term girlfriend. Of the two other men Hines suspected of the same deed, one had just been killed and the other beaten to within an inch of his life. On the night of 5 August, Abberton and a female companion, known in court documents as 'BC', were walking to her car near the Coogee Bay Hotel, when Hines sprang from nowhere, forced the pair into the vehicle, took up the front passenger's seat himself and pulled out a gun. 'He'd been a friend of mine since a young age,' Abberton later said. 'So for me, I was spewing that such a good close mate was putting me in a situation like that.'</p> <p>Deciding that Hines was planning for both men to rape the girl - Abberton testified in court that he said: 'We're taking BC back to my house and we're fucking scotching [raping] her' - he began a struggle that culminated in the shooting. Afterwards, Abberton and BC dumped the body at the base of a nearby cliff. No one, least of all the defendant himself, denied that he had pulled the trigger, and so his plea of self-defence rested largely on the fearsome reputation of the victim. 'Anthony Gerard Hines was known widely - and in fact he encouraged this knowledge - as a violent man, a standover man [extortionist] and a rapist,' defence barrister Graham Turnbull told the jury, before moving at least one of them to tears with stories of Hines' cruel behaviour.</p> <p>Jai was in custody on remand for 21 months before the jury acquitted him after just 90 minutes' deliberation - as he emerged from the court, he repeatedly kissed a crucifix and said: 'I always had faith in God.' This period had been made even darker for the family by his brother Koby being charged with accessory to murder after the fact, hindering the police's investigation and attempting to pervert the course of justice. 'Some of my statement was false,' Koby, a professional surfer, later admitted to Surfvillage.com. 'I said that I never seen Jai that night [of Hines' death], but I said that because I just wanted to keep myself away from Jai.' In 2006, Koby was given a nine-month suspended sentence.</p> <p>The family's agonising wait for the verdicts would later make a poignant and compelling focal point to a documentary about the gang called Bra Boys. Perhaps inevitably narrated by Russell Crowe, it has broken box-office records for a documentary in Australia and is now set for release in the UK. Writer and director Sunny Abberton, the oldest of four brothers, had decided long before the murder trial that his family's story would make a great movie. 'Jai's arrest meant we had to make the whole film much more personal, but with definitely no guarantees of a happy ending,' Sunny says. 'But then, we thought, \"Isn't that our lives? Isn't that typical of the story I'm trying to make? The day-to-day struggle of a family in our community? The rise above adversity?\" And so I convinced Jai, \"Look, isn't this exactly what we're trying to show?\"'</p> <p>Seeing his brother's point, Jai continued to participate in the movie but, wary of more controversy, has avoided the media since. Thus, only two of the brothers are at this interview. The 34-year-old Sunny is stocky, eloquent and surprisingly avuncular: no-nonsense bruiser and community-welfare entrepreneur rolled into one. Koby, 29, is one of the world's foremost big-wave surfers (he once beat eight-times world champion Kelly Slater at a showdown in Maroubra) and the gang's pin-up boy: strong jawed with a glassy-eyed insouciance that is complemented nicely by several tattoos bearing the gang's slogan, 'My Brother's Keeper'. Over lunch at a caf\u00e9 in Coogee, metres from where Jai's short but fateful car journey began five years earlier, it becomes ever-more apparent that calling Bra Boys a 'surf-flick' is as over-simplistic as calling The Wire a 'drugs show'.</p> <p>Maroubra - the last syllable of which is key to the gang's name - is an Eora Aboriginal word for 'place of thunder'. It seems appropriate to the Abbertons' turbulent childhood. Their mother, Lynne, was a heroin addict. They have little recollection of their different fathers (although Koby knows his was a bank robber). How aware were they of the dankness of their upbringing? 'I remember being a teenager and me and some mates beating the shit out of mum's drugs dealer,' Sunny says with a laugh. Koby adds: 'I definitely knew heroin was bad and killed you and Mum was addicted to it. I knew what a junkie was, I knew why they were asleep and had shit all over them, and why they were looking terrible. Everyone around us who took heroin was [considered] scum. Older guys at the beach knew what was going on with our mum before we did, and maybe that's why they took us in.'</p> <p>And so, the Abbertons' childhood house quickly lost its status as 'home'. Much of the brothers' time during the Eighties, along with that of scores of other local kids from broken homes, was spent at the nearby home of their grandmother, aka the Bra Boys matriarch or 'Ma'. 'If anyone started Bra Boys, it was Ma,' Koby says in the movie. The rest of their time was spent down at the water, where entry into some kind of gang was inevitable. 'When I was growing up, the beach had seven board-riders' clubs,' Sunny says. 'They were so rough, so localised, fragmented. Australia is really tribal in that way. Go out to the Palace Hotel on a Saturday night and you'll see all these different groups - country boys, visiting footie teams, Aboriginal surfers, mixed race, homeys. Our generation was the first one to kind of bring it all together.'</p> <p>Sunny was inspired to unite the factions in the area by the strong social fabric, spun from deprivation, that he had witnessed in the slums of Brazil and apartheid South Africa in the early Nineties while touring as a junior surf pro. Two decades on, Bra Boys has, he estimates, around 400 members, about 30 of them hardcore, including several top-grade rugby league players - John Sutton, who plays for Russell Crowe's Rabbitohs team, Damon Alley-Tovio, now with Newtown Jets, and Canterbury Bulldogs' Reni Maitua among them. It has all the rites and rigmarole of an organised gang, including a standard-issue tattoo, that good Old Testament slogan, and a masonic-style greeting that, in keeping with their fraternal ethos, involves an affectionate reciprocal clasping of the recipient's upper forearm.</p> <p>Surfing, the brothers say, is the glue that holds together the gang culture. Maroubra, with its vicious rips and jutting rocks, is renowned as one of the city's most technical surf spots; the risks that they took in the water inevitably seem to have crossed over into other areas of life. 'Pushing social boundaries is not new to the boys,' Sunny says in a voiceover segment of the film. 'And it's that same carefree - perhaps careless - attitude that sees the boys push the boundaries in the surf. There's nothing better than being with your brothers and your friends, psyching each other up to see who's going to charge the hardest.' Is it possible the Bra Boys think they're invincible? 'We all grew up trying to go harder in the waves than everyone else,' Koby says. 'So yeah, I got to an elite level, and then realised, \"Fuck, my friends go as hard as these guys if not harder.\"'</p> <p>'When we started to make the film,' says executive producer Michael Lawrence, 'there was a massive riot that lasted three days out inland near Campbelltown [40km south-west of Maroubra]. They were burning their own houses, the riot squad were in there - they were even going to send in the military. So Sunny said, \"I want to send a camera crew out there because that's what happens when you have nothing - that's what Koby and I could've ended up like. We could've been those kids. The ocean saved us.\" The only reason we didn't go and film was it was too dangerous.'</p> <p>I ask both brothers separately what would have become of them if they had had the same childhood, but inland - say, in a similar suburb of Melbourne or Brisbane. The answer they give is, word for word, identical: 'Dead or in jail.' 'I see that everywhere I travel in the world,' Koby says. 'People who have been going through the same stuff we did are normally already in jail.' It's telling that the film concludes with an RIP montage. 'Those guys died in jail, drug overdoses, some were stabbed, shot - we wanted to end by showing the ones that hadn't made it through,' Sunny says.</p> <p>After lunch, Sunny and Koby take a wander around Maroubra. It's a bitterly cold, stormy day, but Koby appears warmed by beer and nostalgia, peacocking happily around, nonchalantly throwing a beer bottle he has just drained into a hedge and reminiscing about his youthful career as a minor vandal with pride. The brothers are obviously close - they have been ever since Koby came to live with Sunny after being hit in the head by a baseball bat wielded by their mother's boyfriend of the time - and their banter is playful:</p> <p>Koby: 'I was at the circus the other night, and thought the clown was going to call me up on stage. I was scared fucking shitless. I'm not scared of 50-foot swells, but I hate those fucking clowns, mate.'</p> <p>Sunny: 'You didn't mind in New York when they pulled you up on stage with those strippers.'</p> <p>Koby: 'That story should stop there...'</p> <p>They pause at a modest redbrick bungalow. 'This is where our mother lived,' Sunny says. As they pose for the camera on the porch, glad to be briefly out of the rain, the current occupant opens the door to check who the intruders are. He clocks who is occupying his doorstep then departs with some furious, obsequious nods of consent. </p> <p>The wind-and-rain-lashed suburb we are touring is the setting of what Sunny calls 'The Struggle', which goes right back to the earliest days of white settlement in Australia. Maroubra is only five bays south of the flush, flash beach-burb Bondi, yet it has continually managed to dodge the shower of wealth that has befallen Sydney's coastal Eastern Suburbs, almost from Captain Cook's arrival in 1770. As Crowe's narration explains in Bra Boys, 100 years after the First Fleet landed, the area's impoverished settlers were forced to live in caves and beach shacks, along with the Aborigines. In 1930, up to 1,000 families were moved from these camps to stark, imposing, government housing. Since then a sewage works, a rifle range and Australia's largest prison - Long Bay, which sits atop a hill in full view of potential inmates - have sprung up to make Maroubra a carbuncle on an otherwise idyllic stretch of coast. 'That's the uniqueness of Maroubra,' Sunny says. 'Next to all this terrible infrastructure we have the ocean, which taught us respect and pushing your body and so on.'</p> <p>It is a place where poverty, domestic turbulence and crime have always seemed to feed each other. 'There's been tension with the police in this area for over 100 years,' Sunny says. 'The first convicts, the early colonisation years - they're our ancestors. Maroubra was the first place where Aboriginals were banned from going in the sea, and much later the counterculture surf movement started because the council passed laws that banned surfing.' He breaks into a giggle. 'The authorities decided to make surfers wear skirts, but larrikins started turning up in bonnets and bows - that law was soon dropped.'</p> <p>Their distrust of authority, which has simmered ever since, boiled over on 22 December 2002 with an incident that features prominently in the movie. That night, professional surfer and Bra Boy Mark Matthews was celebrating his 21st birthday with 300 friends at the Coogee-Randwick RSL Club. On the floor above, two or three hundred off-duty officers from the Waverley Police Force were holding their own Christmas party. It was a volatile mix and, while no one can agree on who lit the touchpaper, the melee that broke out was big enough to draw helicopters, police dogs and riot squads. By the end of it, more than 30 officers were injured.</p> <p>Sunny is incandescent about the media coverage of the incident. 'The press didn't hear about that fight until four days after,' he says, 'because none of the phone calls police made went through the emergency number - they were all from personal mobile phones to other personal mobile phones between the police. They were trying to cover it up, because it was an event where police officers were drinking. Then, there was huge publicity about the eight Bra Boys arrested, but nothing the day that eight were found not guilty.' Police said there were 80 officers at the party by the time of the incident and that they had been unable to call the emergency services. One Bra Boy admitted assault. Rugby league's Reni Maitua had his conviction for assault overturned when the appeal judge found conflicting evidence. No police were charged or reprimanded.</p> <p>Bra Boy John Gannon, meanwhile, says that 'it was just a good old-fashioned brawl' with 'no knives and no guns pulled... It was a fight, we won, and they were licking their wounds.' </p> <p>'People weren't convicted,' says Matthews, 'but it was still costing friends of mine A$30,000 [\u00a314,000] to go to court. They were losing deposits for their home loans, but everyone acts like we got off scot free.' </p> <p>The Bra Boys came off better in the media, however, during the race riots on Sydney's Cronulla Beach around Christmas 2005. The gang mediated in talks between the white-supremacist mobs and the mostly Lebanese 'outsiders' from whom they wanted to 'reclaim the beaches', as their sinister tagline went. Sunny was glad of the chance for the Bra Boys to demonstrate their take on race. 'The papers, prior to us telling our story, were vilifying us as a white Anglo-Saxon racist gang,' he says. 'I mean, they were saying that migrants and ethnic people had been beaten in the area, Asian shopkeepers beaten on the beach - all absolute bullshit. That runs against the whole ethics of what we are, who we are.' Koby adds: 'Like, out west and stuff, you don't get different crews hanging with each other. Maybe it's the same in England. There's not many places where you get black and white guys, 300 of them together, and you know, all loving each other.' </p> <p>The Bra Boys documentary is a chronological retelling of the gang's evolution: talking-heads interviews with members, spliced with archive amateur footage, street battle re-enactment and big-wave action, soundtracked by the obligatory power-chord rap-rock. Critical reactions to it in Australia were polarised, as epitomised by Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton, presenters of the influential ABC show At The Movies. While Stratton was suspicious of the movie being directed by one of its own subjects and deemed it amateurish, Pomeranz thought the subject matter gritty and captivating enough to overlook the accusations that the film was unpolished or self-serving. Either way, it became the most commercially successfully Australian documentary ever following its local release in 2006.</p> <p>The film generated enough media buzz for the gang to become regulars in the tabloids. The headlines tend to be innocuous these days - a successful campaign to rid Maroubra beach front of parking meters, so that the poor can continue to use the beach; rumours of Koby dating Tara Reid (true) and Paris Hilton (shaky), and the brothers giving the latter an impromptu surf lesson on Malibu Beach. But they show no sign of letting up - and Jai's recent suspended sentence for his sixth offence of driving while disqualified probably did not help.</p> <p>Their recent promotional tour in the States saw Koby and Sunny lord it up with Hollywood's glitterati, who apparently saw these rough-at-heel Aussies, with their movie already made and nobody to impress in pursuit of funding, as a breath of fresh air. They made such an impact on the stogie-smokers in the big studios that a Hollywood adaptation of the Bra Boys' story is reportedly in the pipeline, with Mark Wahlberg touted to play Koby and Russell Crowe himself considering the role of Anthony Hines. </p> <p>As for their personal lives, their mother has finally put heroin behind her ('It's only been in the last year that we've been able to sit down and have dinner and a glass of wine together - first time in 25 years,' Sunny says). But despite the film's success, the brothers still find themselves in financial hardship. 'We went bankrupt after the court case,' Koby says. </p> <p>Sunny elaborates: 'We lost three properties, including our grandma's place that she'd worked two jobs all her life for. Koby lost his main sponsor, too.' Koby is also grappling with a charge of assaulting an off-duty police officer in Hawaii - a charge he denies - and, according to the Australian tabloids, repeated rejections of his marriage proposals by his model girlfriend, Tahyna Tozzi. In an attempt to raise funds, the Abbertons have launched a clothing line called MyBrothersKeeper, with fans of the range sometimes known as MBK Soldiers.</p> <p>Still, these are probably the happiest times in the brothers' lives to date. On a sunnier day than today, they and their mates would be board-shorted up and, high on solar rays and Toohey's New, partying hard - which, judging by some of the movie footage, means turning themselves into human infernos and jumping from lofty rock platforms into the sea, sliding lit bangers into mates' bum-cracks, wrestling each other dressed in giant cornflake boxes and diving into wheelie-bins filled with ice and lager. It seems that the spirit of the Bra Boys is unquenchable.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bra Boys documentary opens in selected cinemas later this month</p>",
  "<p>Our gaze might be on the markets melting down, but the upheaval we are experiencing is more than a financial crisis, however large. Here is a historic geopolitical shift, in which the balance of power in the world is being altered irrevocably. The era of American global leadership, reaching back to the Second World War, is over.</p> <p>You can see it in the way America's dominion has slipped away in its own backyard, with Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez taunting and ridiculing the superpower with impunity. Yet the setback of America's standing at the global level is even more striking. With the nationalisation of crucial parts of the financial system, the American free-market creed has self-destructed while countries that retained overall control of markets have been vindicated. In a change as far-reaching in its implications as the fall of the Soviet Union, an entire model of government and the economy has collapsed.</p> <p>Ever since the end of the Cold War, successive American administrations have lectured other countries on the necessity of sound finance. Indonesia, Thailand, Argentina and several African states endured severe cuts in spending and deep recessions as the price of aid from the International Monetary Fund, which enforced the American orthodoxy. China in particular was hectored relentlessly on the weakness of its banking system. But China's success has been based on its consistent contempt for Western advice and it is not Chinese banks that are currently going bust. How symbolic yesterday that Chinese astronauts take a spacewalk while the US Treasury Secretary is on his knees.</p> <p>Despite incessantly urging other countries to adopt its way of doing business, America has always had one economic policy for itself and another for the rest of the world. Throughout the years in which the US was punishing countries that departed from fiscal prudence, it was borrowing on a colossal scale to finance tax cuts and fund its over-stretched military commitments. Now, with federal finances critically dependent on continuing large inflows of foreign capital, it will be the countries that spurned the American model of capitalism that will shape America's economic future.</p> <p>Which version of the bail out of American financial institutions cobbled up by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is finally adopted is less important than what the bail out means for America's position in the world. The populist rant about greedy banks that is being loudly ventilated in Congress is a distraction from the true causes of the crisis. The dire condition of America's financial markets is the result of American banks operating in a free-for-all environment that these same American legislators created. It is America's political class that, by embracing the dangerously simplistic ideology of deregulation, has responsibility for the present mess.</p> <p>In present circumstances, an unprecedented expansion of government is the only means of averting a market catastrophe. The consequence, however, will be that America will be even more starkly dependent on the world's new rising powers. The federal government is racking up even larger borrowings, which its creditors may rightly fear will never be repaid. It may well be tempted to inflate these debts away in a surge of inflation that would leave foreign investors with hefty losses. In these circumstances, will the governments of countries that buy large quantities of American bonds, China, the Gulf States and Russia, for example, be ready to continue supporting the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency? Or will these countries see this as an opportunity to tilt the balance of economic power further in their favour? Either way, the control of events is no longer in American hands.</p> <p>The fate of empires is very often sealed by the interaction of war and debt. That was true of the British Empire, whose finances deteriorated from the First World War onwards, and of the Soviet Union. Defeat in Afghanistan and the economic burden of trying to respond to Reagan's technically flawed but politically extremely effective Star Wars programme were vital factors in triggering the Soviet collapse. Despite its insistent exceptionalism, America is no different. The Iraq War and the credit bubble have fatally undermined America's economic primacy. The US will continue to be the world's largest economy for a while longer, but it will be the new rising powers that, once the crisis is over, buy up what remains intact in the wreckage of America's financial system. </p> <p>There has been a good deal of talk in recent weeks about imminent economic armageddon. In fact, this is far from being the end of capitalism. The frantic scrambling that is going on in Washington marks the passing of only one type of capitalism - the peculiar and highly unstable variety that has existed in America over the last 20 years. This experiment in financial laissez-faire has imploded.While the impact of the collapse will be felt everywhere, the market economies that resisted American-style deregulation will best weather the storm. Britain, which has turned itself into a gigantic hedge fund, but of a kind that lacks the ability to profit from a downturn, is likely to be especially badly hit.</p> <p>The irony of the post-Cold War period is that the fall of communism was followed by the rise of another utopian ideology. In American and Britain, and to a lesser extent other Western countries, a type of market fundamentalism became the guiding philosophy. The collapse of American power that is underway is the predictable upshot. Like the Soviet collapse, it will have large geopolitical repercussions. An enfeebled economy cannot support America's over-extended military commitments for much longer. Retrenchment is inevitable and it is unlikely to be gradual or well planned.</p> <p>Meltdowns on the scale we are seeing are not slow-motion events. They are swift and chaotic, with rapidly spreading side-effects. Consider Iraq. The success of the surge, which has been achieved by bribing the Sunnis, while acquiescing in ongoing ethnic cleansing, has produced a condition of relative peace in parts of the country. How long will this last, given that America's current level of expenditure on the war can no longer be sustained?</p> <p>An American retreat from Iraq will leave Iran the regional victor. How will Saudi Arabia respond? Will military action to forestall Iran acquiring nuclear weapons be less or more likely? China's rulers have so far been silent during the unfolding crisis. Will America's weakness embolden them to assert China's power or will China continue its cautious policy of 'peaceful rise'? At present, none of these questions can be answered with any confidence. What is evident is that power is leaking from the US at an accelerating rate. Georgia showed Russia redrawing the geopolitical map, with America an impotent spectator.</p> <p>Outside the US, most people have long accepted that the development of new economies that goes with globalisation will undermine America's central position in the world. They imagined that this would be a change in America's comparative standing, taking place incrementally over several decades or generations. Today, that looks an increasingly unrealistic assumption.</p> <p>Having created the conditions that produced history's biggest bubble, America's political leaders appear unable to grasp the magnitude of the dangers the country now faces. Mired in their rancorous culture wars and squabbling among themselves, they seem oblivious to the fact that American global leadership is fast ebbing away. A new world is coming into being almost unnoticed, where America is only one of several great powers, facing an uncertain future it can no longer shape.</p> <p>\u2022 John Gray is the author of Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia (Allen Lane)</p>",
  "<p>It would seem the time has come to get on the Batphone and tell the campaigning dads of Fathers 4 Justice, Families Need Fathers, and all the other angry dad groups that they can now wriggle out of their superhero costumes, for, gentlemen, surely your battle is won? </p> <p>A study by the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy was set up by the Ministry of Justice to look into non-resident parents being awarded little or no contact with their children for the flimsiest of reasons. Last week, the study concluded that the vast majority of separated fathers enjoy access to their children. Only one in 10 cases ends up in court, the rest having been agreed between the parents. When the cases do go to court, more than three-quarters of the applicants, mainly fathers, are able to resolve contact issues, with only a small percentage denied contact altogether, in the interests of the children involved. </p> <p>Not bad, in fact, pretty reasonable. Why then have these findings not been met with cries of joy from disgruntled campaigning fathers? There's just been some low-key muttering about how that's all very well, but what about the 'presumption of shared care'? Could it be, as I have long suspected, that, for many members of fathers' groups, it's always been less about justice-seeking than it has been about attention-seeking? While these fathers' groups may have been set up with the best of intentions, they evolved all too quickly into social clubs for miserable sods who wanted a free pass to whine about women.</p> <p>Indeed, these past years, isn't it arguable that these campaigning dads have done more than any spiteful female to denigrate and undermine the concept of fatherhood, not to mention make a farce of it? Consider for one moment the frightening thought patterns that lead a grown man to think dressing up as Spiderman is his best shot at being taken seriously. Does a man like this have the Spidey sense he was born with? More seriously, going by my experience with family courts, have dads ever really had it that bad? </p> <p>I wasn't remotely interested in barring contact between my daughter and her father. However, I couldn't help noticing that had I wanted this, to get anywhere, I would probably have had to produce camcorder footage of him tying her to a railway line while wickedly twiddling a luxuriant moustache. This is the truth of family courts - they are proactive almost to a fault about finding a way for the non-resident parent, male or female, to maintain contact with their children. They are fixated by this issue to the virtual exclusion of all others, which is the way it should be - whether the mother likes it or not. </p> <p>However, contrary to the impression groups such as F4J give, mothers generally do like their children to have a father - you don't often see women on Jeremy Kyle shows wanting a paternity test to proves someone isn't the father. And women want fathers around not only for the priceless input of positive male influence, but also for the Holy Grail that all mothers, single or otherwise, seek - safe and reliable childcare. And there lies the bottom line. However badly the relationship ended, if he's a half-decent, committed dad, it's a rare and stupid woman who'll let go of him, not only for the child's sake, but her own - think of all the free babysitting. </p> <p>In this way, it becomes clear that the real reasons a woman might not want the biological father around are just that - real reasons - ultimately to do with genuine fears about him hurting or upsetting the children or disrupting their lives in some way. In the special case of a 'campaigning dad', add maybe his inability to see past himself, his own pain, his own axes to grind, while doing his best to make his rage and ego seem like a noble quest. </p> <p>It says something that one hears stories about how some of these campaigning dads fail to show up to see their children because they're far too busy ... campaigning to see them! It makes you wonder who's in those costumes - are they genuinely wounded and devoted dads or drama queens who find the cause far more exciting than actual fathering could ever be?</p> <p>It's time for disgruntled, estranged dads to realise that women simply cannot stop men being fathers. Only men can stop men being fathers. Indeed, all things considered, maybe the MOJ study might be a good opportunity to disband these groups for good. Let's face it, no one ever said that families didn't need fathers - there was just the suggestion that, once in a while, they could think about climbing out of their Batman suits and doing some actual fathering.</p> <h2>Now he's laughing all the way to the bank, Banksy's a bore</h2> <p>Banksy, the graffiti guerrilla artist, has formed a 'pest fund' to identify the hundreds of works attributed to him that aren't actually his. He is also urging people not to take any of these works, or to buy them, unless they have been created for sale and officially authenticated. Wow - how renegade, how 'out there'. It's like van Gogh hacking his ear off all over again. Except it isn't.</p> <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought this type of art was all about madness and impetuosity, as well as challenging the very definition of what art is or could be. So surely the fake Banksys fit right in. If guerrilla artists can run amok, why not fake guerrilla artists or even guerrilla art lovers? </p> <p>Yet here we see Banksy whingeing about wanting everything officially authenticated and fastidiously pointing out which spray-canned doodles are his. 'Nah, that rat shitting in a Starbucks cup ain't mine. Nor that one of Ann Widdecombe lap dancing neither.' Amazing isn't it how once someone's work starts selling for big bucks how corporate and humourless they become?</p> <p>Mind you, some of us always had doubts. There's been lots of speculation about who Banksy is - a man, a woman, a gang? - but there's no doubt what he's become - just another art book talking point on the coffee table, the 21st-century equivalent of those 'amusing' clacking balls businessmen used to have on their desks.</p> <p>But maybe this is sour grapes. There is what I thought to be a Banksy at the top of my street. It's a Che Guevara sketch which, feeling a bit broke, I had half a mind to chisel off and hotfoot it to Sotheby's with. As Che is not doing anything peculiar, such as changing a baby's nappy or French kissing Stalin, I had this romantic idea that Banksy might have suffered sprayus interruptus and had to run off before he'd finished.</p> <p>Now I realise that it's just a fake, it seems more authentically Banksy than ever.</p> <h2>Paul McCartney ... is he arrogant or serially henpecked?</h2> <p>It's difficult for vegetarians such as myself to criticise Paul McCartney. We view him as a kind of living god, soya-based version. But what on earth was he up to with that gig in Tel Aviv?</p> <p>Criticised for not also playing Palestine, and for costing more to protect than President Bush, McCartney could only blather pompously about 'helping the peace process in my own small way [blahhh] talking to Palestinians and Israelis, [drone] finding out for myself what the situation is'. Oh the agonising stupidity and arrogance of the man! What next - an appearance in bin Laden's next cave video. 'Come on, Osama, pull up a tasselled cushion and let al-Qaeda give peace a chance!'</p> <p>At first, I thought, this isn't McCartney's fault. Such is the Fab Four's influence that, just like the Queen smells fresh paint everywhere she goes, all Macca hears is Beatles worship: 'We love you Paul, your music heals us' and all that suck-up. Hence the possibility that McCartney genuinely believes that the Israel-Palestine conflict can be helped with a quick burst of 'Yesterday' and a cheeky thumbs-up.</p> <p>Then a dark thought occurred. Was Tel Aviv just more evidence that McCartney is the most pussy-whipped music icon ever? A former Beatle who lets his birds boss him around and tell him what to do.</p> <p>Think about it. It was lovely Linda who turned Paul on to vegetarianism. Then there was all that rolling about with seals with Heather. Now he has a Jewish girlfriend, the glamorous Nancy Shevell, he's suddenly playing concerts in Israel and 'finding out for myself what the situation is'.</p> <p>Suspicious? I think so. Let us pray that I'm wrong.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron started to think about his party conference speech a couple of months ago and the prospect made him unusually nervous. The Tory leader groaned to friends that he would never be able to top last year's act - 'Look Mum, no notes' - when he strode around the stage of Blackpool's Winter Gardens and performed without the aid of text or autocue. </p> <p>'What do I do this year?' he asked his intimates. 'Come on naked?' </p> <p>You will be relieved to hear that he has decided against that. The nation will be spared exposure to Mr Cameron's pink bits. </p> <p>He will instead deliver his speech in the old-fashioned way: from a lectern with a pile of paper in front of him. One senior Tory tells me: 'It will be the exact opposite of his speech in Blackpool.' That is no less an attempt to make a statement about himself than last year's walkie-talkie feat of memory. Then his priority was to appear cool under the threat of an early election which the polls said he would lose. Now he needs to look ready to move into Number 10. </p> <p>This year demands something quite different and altogether more serious from the Tory leader. When he speaks in Birmingham, it will be as the Prime Minister-in-waiting. Labour's gathering in Manchester and its post-conference poll bump have not changed the fundamental assumption of both the political class and the country. Both look at the Tory leader as a man with the keys to Number 10 in his grasp. So too do the lobbyists and corporates who will be swarming around the conference hotels.</p> <p>The position of Prime Minister presumptive invites - demands, in fact - much more intense scrutiny of the man and his prospectus. Not least because he will be asking for the voters to trust him with the country in the menacing context of the worst crisis in the financial markets since 1929. Anything that looks like an act, however well executed, will seem frivolous against this austere and threatening backdrop. This year, the performance must be secondary to the substance. </p> <p>We know the Tory leader can be light on his feet; now the country wants persuading that he is a heavyweight. We don't want to see his bottom. We do need evidence that he has bottom. </p> <p>David Cameron's first task is to demonstrate that he and George Osborne are up to the scale of the challenge. That question has been sharpened by Gordon Brown's clever line to his conference about this being 'no time for a novice'. Goliath's swipe at both the Davids who are after his job was his most effective stinger. Divided about much else, the cabinet have coalesced around the strategy of painting the Conservatives as a gamble that the voters can't afford to take at a time of such high peril.</p> <p>It is a double-edged sword, this attempt by Downing Street to make the contrast one between its weatherbeaten captain and the callow youth of Dave and George. To draw attention to the inexperience of the Tories' top team is also to draw attention to the length of time that Labour has been in office. To remind people that the youthful Tories have never been in charge of anything serious is also to remind people that responsibility for the state of the country belongs exclusively to Gordon Brown. That said, this is the line that Labour has settled on and I find that it does jangle nerves among Tories. Speaking to members of the shadow cabinet, I hear quite a lot of anxiety that 'the novice' line could have potency with voters. </p> <p>As an attack on David Cameron, the charge of inexperience has the merit of being true. Neither the Tories' putative Prime Minister nor their candidate for Chancellor has ever held ministerial office. David Cameron got a first in PPE from Oxford, but if this doesn't hugely impress me it is because I know quite a few people with alpha degrees in economics who are absolutely hopeless with money. His practical commercial experience is limited to being a public relations man for a TV company and the closest he has come to decision-making during a financial emergency is as a bag carrier for Norman Lamont at the time of Black Wednesday. That's not a line on his CV most likely to instil public confidence. George Osborne has only a vicarious grasp of business and finance, gained from being an aide to John Major and watching his parents build up their wallpaper empire. </p> <p>The other political dimension of this crisis that creates anxiety among senior Tories is that they will be seen as the chums of the City at a time when the public are in a mood to throttle the hedge fund managers with the intestines of the bankers. The electorate do not seem to care that David Cameron is an affluent old Etonian. Labour got nowhere with its half-witted 'Tory toff' campaign in the Crewe byelection. The voters will mind if they think of the Tories as the bosom buddies of the reckless gamblers who have unleashed such turmoil on the financial markets. </p> <p>'Labour would like people to think that we are all Flaming Ferraris,' observes one shrewd member of the shadow cabinet. This is a threat to all of Mr Cameron's efforts to detoxify the Tory brand. He made it the mission of his leadership to convince the voters to stop seeing the Tories as the party of the greedy, the selfish, the sleazy and the nasty. That work will be undone if voters associate his party with the spivs who have brought us to the brink of an economic armageddon.</p> <p>Crises can be highly illuminating about leaders and wannabe leaders. It is from their instinctive reactions under stress that we get a measure of the true temperament of politicians. In the early stages of the banking meltdown, the Tories' reflexive response was to side with the financial markets rather than their victims. David Cameron gave us a sense of his priorities when he told the Financial Times: 'We must not let the left use this as an excuse to wreck an important part of the British and world economy.' No, Dave, the real menace is not Derek Simpson. The greatest threat is that the City will wreck itself and the lives of millions of other people in the process. George Osborne came out against a clamp-down on short-selling just before restrictions were introduced by those revolutionary socialists in the White House. </p> <p>Remarks by the shadow Chancellor about markets were shamelessly twisted by Gordon Brown to make them sound diabolically heartless. It is worth quoting what Mr Osborne actually said: 'No one takes any pleasure from people making money out of the misery of others, but that is a function of capitalist markets.' While not as cruel as Mr Brown suggested, his words will have sounded coldly pitiless to anyone about to lose their home or their job. Victims of the credit crunch will not appreciate Mr Osborne drily telling them that their misery is an inevitable side-effect of the 'function of markets'. Being told that the devil will always take the hindmost is not what you want to hear when you've just received a repossession notice. </p> <p>There's some evidence that both the Tory leader and the shadow Chancellor have become more sensitive to this. A celebration of their recent election successes has been scrubbed from today's agenda. Champagne will still be drunk at the Tory conference, but it will be quaffed behind closed doors. The Tories don't want the cameras to witness them clinking glasses of Krug when many voters are having to cut back on their groceries. That celebration has been replaced with a joint appearance by Messrs Cameron and Osborne to discuss the economy. Sombre is the tone that has been prescribed. </p> <p>Some on the right, with mad disregard for both the politics and the economics of this crisis, think that the Tory party's task is to be the full-throated champions of turbo-capitalism, to loudly argue the case for unrestrained markets red in tooth and claw. Wisely, the smarter minds in the shadow cabinet seem to recognise how crazy this would be. I'm told that Messrs Cameron and Osborne plan to acknowledge that the financial markets have been out of control and announce a tighter regulatory regime for the City. </p> <p>The Tories will claim that they have a 'Plan for Change', a slogan plagiarised from Barack Obama. But they have hitherto been either silent or sketchy about how they would deal with the financial crisis and its consequences.</p> <p>Over the past 12 months, whether the issue has been Northern Rock or the 10p tax band, the Conservatives have been pretty effective at whacking the government but much less impressive whenever asked to detail what they would do.</p> <p>When pressed for an answer, Mr Cameron tends to reply with the travel advice of the Irishman: 'I wouldn't start from here.' That might get him through a television interview. It won't get him through a premiership. </p> <p>Here is where we are and it is a dark and scary place. Here is where millions of voters are shivering in fear about whether they will still have a job or a home in six months time. Not only does the country expect a better answer from the Tories, it deserves a better one.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago, Mr Cameron was planning to leave Labour to stew in its unpopularity and keep the substance to a minimum at his own conference. He won't get away with that now. The country looks for seriousness from the man who wants to be its Prime Minister. If he doesn't have any answers, then David Cameron really will find himself on the conference stage without any clothes on.</p>",
  "<p>Primary schools should emphasise 'lifestyle and wellbeing' as much as English and maths, according to a report being studied by the government's primary curriculum review team.</p> <p>Teachers everywhere must be delighted: more advice! Barely a week goes by without new guidelines that they should teach this, they shouldn't teach that, more core curriculum, less core curriculum, more tests, fewer tests ... If I were the government, I'd be quite happy to assume that teachers went to school themselves, spend most of their time with children and are quite capable of working out what does or doesn't succeed in the classroom without quite so much external help and instruction. </p> <p>Wellbeing ... yes, sure. It's not a bad idea to look out for children being starved or thumped at home. But have you ever met a teacher who needed to be told that? It's been several decades since a teacher last thought: 'My main concern about this thin, bruised kid is that he doesn't know the capital of Sweden.'</p> <p>It's the 'lifestyle' part that really worries me.

'I swear to God, I'm ageing under the pressure. I look like I'm eight years old. I'll have to up the Botox.'</p> <p>She rummaged in her Luella Bartley clutch and pulled out a string of liquorice. Scrubbing off the bits of fluff, she chewed thoughtfully.</p> <p>'Tough day?' asked Tim, decanting milkshake into a pair of wittily asymmetrical tumblers.</p> <p>'Omigod! Nightmare! First we had spelling ...' Topsy flicked open her T-Mobile G1. 'Check out this photo of the blackboard ... I mean, BUCKET? BUCKET? We've only just done CAT!

'You should be in McQueen.' 'And the sandpit? You want to hear about the sandpit? I was all over the place, having missed the training weekend in the Algarve.

'Have you still not found any organic Gummi bears?'</p> <p>'I'm afraid it's worse than that,' said Mummy. 'Dad isn't going to be working at the bank any more. In fact, the bank has closed down and gone away.' </p> <p>'What's he going to do?' asked Topsy.</p> <p>'We're not sure,' said Mummy. 'For the moment, he's just going to stand in the garden screaming. Then he'll probably go to Granny's for a little while.'</p> <p>'What about Uncle Bob?' said Tim. 'Is he not going to the bank either?'</p> <p>'No, that's right,' said Mummy. 'Uncle Bob is going to spend some quiet time in the car, banging his head on the steering wheel. That's if he is allowed to keep the car. We're not sure yet.

  "<p>To me, if a young person dies in an intensive care unit and their organs are not donated, that's a waste.</p> <p>I remember the tragic case of a young man, aged about 20, who was in a road traffic accident. Not one good thing came of it. He was dead. The family were devastated and, in their grief, didn't want to entertain the prospect of organ donation. Yet when relatives do say yes, they can gain solace because there's something tangible left behind that's a marker for someone's life. A liver or kidney transplant patient will always think about their donor. </p> <p>Organ donation is incredibly important. But the basic problem is that we don't have enough organs. And we have ever-increasing waiting lists of people needing a transplant. It's 7,900 at the moment, but in 2003-04 it was 6,061.</p> <p>We should move to the same system of 'soft' presumed consent as Spain. There, people are assumed to have agreed to their organs being removed unless they have refused permission or their family objects at the end of their life. Donation rates there are three times ours, which are among the lowest in Europe. A recent ICM poll for the BBC found that 66 per cent of people said they supported presumed consent.</p> <p>The NHS needs to give organ donation much greater priority because there are potential donors out there whose families aren't being approached. When it looks like a patient is brain dead, the family should automatically be approached by a professional, compassionate, knowledgeable person to talk about organ donation. That is done in some places, but staff aren't consistently good at it. Some doctors in hospitals are not approaching families. Some doctors simply don't raise the subject. Consistency on this would reduce the refusal rates, which are 25 per cent across the country and 49 per cent in London, and could double the number of people whose organs are donated.</p> <p>The Organ Donation Taskforce has proposed making payments to hospitals to cover the extra costs to intensive care units of looking after patients until their organs can be transplanted. Personally, and I accept that this is a controversial point of view, I also favour the state paying some or all of an organ donor's funeral expenses. Some people might feel that constitutes bribery, but from a compassionate point of view, helping them have a decent burial would be a sign from society that we are grateful.</p> <p>To me, the thought that I'm going to be changing other people's lives by agreeing to donate my organs is very powerful. I regret that the debate over whether people should opt in or opt out has become a political football. Presumed consent is not about 'control' or families 'having' to consent, as some people have said. It's about ensuring that people are always offered the opportunity of organ donation, and the opportunity to transform someone else's life. It would be the hallmark of a caring society that instinctively wants to help others.</p> <p>\u2022 Professor Nigel Heaton is head of the liver transplant unit at King's College Hospital, London, which carries out 200 such procedures every year</p>",
  "<p>'I'm really worried for my mother. She has \u00a325,000 in Isas and her life savings with Bradford &amp; Bingley.'</p> <p>Alexander Lawrence, 22, a student from Bristol, is one of the millions of people whose family finances are tied up with the fate of the former building society. 'I had to call her this morning to tell her the bad news because she is on holiday in Italy at the moment. She's worried and will have to sort it out when she gets back.'</p> <p>Last night the government was considering the possibility of a temporary nationalisation of B&amp;B after talks to agree a last-minute rescue deal with the Spanish bank Santander stalled. An announcement is expected later today on whether the final decision to nationalise has been taken. </p> <p>The government had been in discussions with Santander for more than a week before rescue talks reached a deadlock last night. It seems the Spanish bank is loath to acquire B&amp;B's so-called 'toxic' assets without some government assurances. As a deal could not be reached, temporary nationalisation was mooted as a solution to give Santander more time to come to a decision. </p> <p>The government still hopes Santander will buy B&amp;B, but another solution could be to carve it up between Santander and HSBC. The Treasury has admitted, however, that if a commercial solution cannot be agreed upon, B&amp;B could remain in government control for some time - posing a considerable financial and political risk to the government. </p> <p>Santander's presence on the British high street is growing: it already owns Abbey and is buying Alliance &amp; Leicester, and consolidation is proceeding apace in the troubled global banking sector. Whatever happens now, more than 150 years of independent history for a proud Yorkshire company will be at an end within hours.</p> <p>One solution that had been put forward during the talks earlier yesterday by B&amp;B's adviser, Goldman Sachs, was for the bank's toxic mortgage loans to be parcelled together with those of Northern Rock to create a government-owned 'bad bank'. That would free the Rock's 'good' loans to be sold to Santander or another bidder, and combined with B&amp;B's high-quality mortgages. </p> <p>Santander, which controls around 12 per cent of the UK mortgage market, is keen to expand but only wants to buy B&amp;B if it can obtain some government assurances to limit the potential losses it might be taking on. Arrears on B&amp;B's book of mortgages are currently running at double the industry average.</p> <p>News of B&amp;B's imminent downfall prompted some anxious investors to remove their cash, though on nothing like the scale of the chaotic scenes that followed rumours Northern Rock was about to collapse just over a year ago. </p> <p>The bank admitted people had been withdrawing money on the internet this weekend and said there were small queues of savers at a handful of its 200 branches, but added that staff had volunteered to give up their weekends to make sure customers could all get their money out straight away. 'The hard work and loyalty of our staff has been fantastic - I am very proud of them,' said B&amp;B chief executive Richard Pym. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the commitment of the bank's tellers has not been enough to save B&amp;B from a fate brought about by its former senior managers. They transformed it from a traditional building society into a specialist lender that bet heavily on buy-to-let loans and self-certification mortgages, where borrowers did not have to supply any evidence of their earnings.</p> <p>And like Northern Rock, B&amp;B relied heavily on the wholesale credit markets for its funding - and they have now seized up in the credit crunch. </p> <p>'With Northern Rock people didn't believe that their savings were safe; [this time] they do, which has prevented a run on B&amp;B. But it still has a problem, because it can't renew its funding on the wholesale markets,' said Ray Boulger of John Charcol.</p> <p>B&amp;B is the latest British casualty of the sub-prime crisis, which has spread across the world from the trailer parks of the US. Gordon Brown returned from Washington early yesterday morning, where he had been meeting President Bush for talks on the plan to bail out US banks, and went straight to Number 10 to join the B&amp;B rescue attempt. Chancellor Alistair Darling is also spending the weekend in Downing Street. They are in constant contact with officials from the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog that is desperate to avert another run on a major bank. </p> <p>The fact that the country's sixth largest mortgage lender is teetering on the edge of collapse is likely to cost homeowners a great deal, regardless of the ultimate outcome. A takeover by Santander would reduce competition in the loans market, where the number of major players has already shrunk after the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB last week, creating a giant lender controlling more than 20 per cent of the market. </p> <p>Uncertainty in the financial markets has pushed the rate at which banks lend to each other to its highest level for 16 years, and the increased cost of borrowing is being passed on to customers. HSBC, First Direct, Woolwich and the Yorkshire building society all put up their fixed-rate mortgages last week. </p> <p>'Clearly the B&amp;B situation is not helpful,' said Boulger. 'It has been cutting back on its lending for some months so the supply of loans will not reduce by much. But it is terrible for sentiment. We will see more lenders put their rates up a quarter point or so, though hopefully not on a horrific scale. The worse the situation gets, the sooner the Bank of England will have to cut base rates.'</p> <p>B&amp;B's demise is also a dark omen for the troubled buy-to-let market. Buy-to-let loans, as the government is acutely aware, are crucial to the fortunes of the housing market. If landlords rush to sell their properties, they could swamp the market and send prices plunging even faster. Financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown recently warned that as many as 200,000 of the buy-to-let mortgages taken out last year could be in negative equity and that 10,000 people have already run up arrears.</p> <p>Around 85 per cent of B&amp;B's \u00a341bn loan book is made up of mortgages granted to amateur landlords or self-certificators. It has 15 per cent of the total buy-to-let mortgage sector, which has mushroomed to \u00a3132.5bn in the past 10 years. More than a million people owe money on buy-to-let mortgages.</p> <p>'Most buy-to-let investors coming to the end of their initial mortgage deals have been having difficulty getting another one,' said Boulger. 'If people have taken out large loans on city-centre flats that have fallen in value, they will have trouble.'</p> <p>B&amp;B has two-and-a-half million savers and the bank stressed this weekend that their cash is secure, with deposits of up to \u00a335,000 covered by the government-backed protection scheme. But whether it is bought or nationalised, there are likely to be heavy job losses among the company's 3,000 staff, on top of the 370 employees it axed last week.</p> <p>That will add to the gloom in the financial services industry, which has already seen redundancies at Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers and is expecting more at HBOS. International bank HSBC axed 1,100 jobs worldwide and 500 in the UK last week. Bankers said there are likely to be more bank failures or rescue mergers. Concerns centre around smaller building societies and other buy-to-let mortgage specialists such as Paragon.</p> <p>B&amp;B's demise will remove the last former building society from the stock market - an ignominious end to the brave new world the lenders claimed to be ushering in when they floated their shares, offering cash windfalls that turned out to cost their customers very dearly indeed.</p>",
  "<h2>House of cards</h2> <p>Sky News's political 'Top Trumps' playing cards, based on the Seventies children's game, have become a staple of the political conference season. But this year's deck contains hidden messages. At the top of each card is a mocked-up screenshot of the featured politician, incorporating the Sky News digital clock - and the time it shows indicates the date when insiders believe the subject's front-line political career will end. So '20:18' means David Miliband could be back on the backbenches by 2018, while another young pretender, James Purnell, is safe until 20:22. The time on Gordon Brown's screenshot? 20:08. Oh dear.</p> <h2>Dutiful game</h2> <p>Proof that even the most amiable ministers rarely let their guard down. Football-loving Health Secretary Alan Johnson, pictured, a lifelong QPR supporter, dined with GMTV's Manchester City fanatic John Stapleton last week, and the dapper presenter soon steered the conversation towards the beautiful game. 'So are you going to get promoted this year?' Stapleton asked. 'I'm not even sure there's going to a reshuffle,' Johnson protested.</p> <h2>Grand designs</h2> <p>Katie Grand, founder of the hugely influential fashion mag Pop, has left the title, and industry insiders say she is bound for Cond\u00e9 Nast. The top people's publisher plans to launch a similarly cutting edge publication, with Grand at the helm, although the project remains a closely guarded secret. As a teenager,. Grand dreamed of editing Vogue, also published by Cond\u00e9 Nast, so it will be interesting to see how its editor Alex Schulman, who has boosted sales without compromising its aspirational appeal, greets her arrival.</p> <h2>Bullingdon ban</h2> <p>Susannah Herbert, the Sunday Times's literary editor, will succeed Eleanor Mills as editor of the paper's News Review, after Mills was handed control of the Saturday edition of the Times. The popular Herbert is a fully paid-up member of the Notting Hill set: her husband, Jonathan Ford, is one of the young men pictured alongside David Cameron in the infamous Bullingdon Club picture. Sunday Times executives have already let it be known that 'Where are they now?' articles about Bullingdon alumni are strictly off-limits. </p> <h2>Armed farces</h2> <p>Last week, the Daily Mail's Ephraim Hardcastle column wrote about the media's deal with Buckingham Palace earlier this year, which enabled Prince Harry, pictured, to fight in Afghanistan, describing it as 'a farce [which] will never be repeated. The posed pictures provided - including Harry... pretending to fire a machine gun at the Taliban - were laughably bogus.' </p> <p>Could this be the same paper that published the 'laughably bogus' pictures in February, alongside a breathless account of the Prince's derring-do that began: 'Crouching behind sandbags, a box of ammunition by his side, this is Prince Harry opening fire on the Taliban. Manning a powerful machine gun for the first time, the prince fired round after round across cratered No Man's Land, using only distant puffs of smoke as his target'? Indeed it could.</p>",
  "<p>It is, of course, alchemy, all of it, nothing but damned alchemy. They're modern necromancers, the whole of the film-making industry, and the business of how on earth anything gets made, or works (or, equally entertainingly, fails) has filled many fascinating books. And one of the fascinating things about alchemy is the injection of time to the equation: because elements settle, and alter, and morph; and, today, after a quarter of a century or whatever, we can see what remained lead, and what became gold.</p> <p>It was exactly 25 years ago when Bill Forsyth made Local Hero. It's still regularly hailed as one of the quiet must-see little masterpieces of British cinema: I can think of few friends, of all ages and backgrounds, without a copy nestling happily on some shelf, brought out on cold nights. The marvel is that it has lasted so tremendously well. It is, in some ways, of its time. A nefarious American oil company sends a yuppie ingenu to Scotland to buy a beach. He meets sturdy, feisty locals, falls in love, sees the Northern Lights, changes his mind about the oil business. In one late-ish crucial scene we see his pager, black and American and Eighties and very bleepy, burbling itself to death in a rock-pool. Back in his Houston loft, with his absurd trappings, he can think only of the locals, the lights, the beach, the pub, the phone box. Which he calls.</p> <p>As, apparently, have hundreds, thousands of tourists down the years. Pennan in Aberdeenshire, where half the film was shot, still has, or at least did on my last visit, admittedly a few years ago, the same phone box. The guys in the bar opposite were getting a bit fed up, called out nightly through the rain to the ringing box, to chat to some Japanese couple who had taken its number on their trip, and wanted the same sense of phone contact with which the film ends. It is huge physical testament, if infuriating for the crofter wanting a quiet dram, to the global appeal, perennial success, of a home-funded, home-made Scottish Eighties film. </p> <p>Yes, Burt Lancaster was on board. Producer David Puttnam says now it couldn't really have happened without that: despite the genius of Forsyth - a rising star after Gregory's Girl - they still needed a big Hollywood name. </p> <p>Yes, Mark Knopfler did the music (and Dire Straits were the band of the moment, the soundtrack going on to outsell video sales of the film itself). But. But. There had to be something else. What's made this last, when so much other celluloid from those days should have been dumped straight back into the alchemist's chalice?</p> <p>'It's probably the deficiences in it,' says Forsyth, now 60, speaking from his home near Loch Lomond. 'I don't think it was a manipulative film. If I'd known how to, at the time, I could have made it more manipulative. I'm not trying to be coy, but I've never had a great understanding for commercial cinema. A film-maker with more nous would have been more manipulative.</p> <p>'I hesitate to use the word \"innocence\" about it, because the characters have attitude, have stories, have views, I don't think it was too innocent a film. But if there was a layer of purpose or intent missing, a layer of manipulation - here's where we want the audience to feel this, or that, I've always truly hated that - then, perhaps, that's been its secret, if you like.'</p> <p>Forsyth says he hasn't watched it for about 20 years. 'I don't really do that. I'll see mistakes!' One, he admits, was completely his own, fortunately over-ridden. 'Looking back, you'd hardly credit it, but I didn't want music. I was a bit of an egghead about film: I was of this puritan streak that if you had to put music in it then you had, somehow, failed. I am proud to admit I was very, very wrong. Mark's [Knopfler] music helped make the film and I am very, very grateful to him. Plus, it wasn't one of those deals you often get with the composer, where the first inkling they get of the film is after it's made, in some grotty studio in Soho. Mark, because we'd wanted him to be involved with the ceilidh music - he wrote all of it, in the end - was on set, around, getting the feel, talking to the locals, picking up the atmosphere.</p> <p>'I really was quite naive. Then. Probably still am. I couldn't, for instance, see how the settings could mesh. I'd just written down - I wanted the village here, the beach there, the church there. The place, such a place, couldn't be found. I was very confused when the location guys said, fine, let's shoot the village on one side of Scotland, the beach on the west. I couldn't get my head around it. And, of course, it worked. I remember settling on Pennan, on the very last day I could: I had a gun to my head, and had to make the phone call by five that day to confirm. I made the phone call, just before five. Yes, from that blooming phone box.'</p> <p>According to Puttnam, 'One of the reasons it all worked, still works, is because it was a very honest film. It didn't pretend the villagers didn't want to sell up. It has classic elements of absolute chaos, back to the kind of writing of Victorian times - Trollope, Pooter. Although it was, yes, telling a story from its time, there were certain classic elements. The wise old man on the beach is a staple, down centuries.</p> <p>'Also, perhaps it's lasted because the very experience of making it was so enjoyable. It was as if we'd all gone on holiday and someone had remembered to bring a camera. Looking back, too, it was probably the first mainstream entertaining film that ever questioned the complexity of ecology.'</p> <p>Bill Forsyth is immensely grateful still to Puttnam and co - do you remember those heady days of 'The British are coming!' - for the 'luxury, very rare in those days, of being paid. I got paid to write it. Because Puttnam had got involved, we knew that a) we had funding, and b) it was, come what may, going to be released. That was unusual. Very.</p> <p>'But I think some of them maybe had more fun making it than me. I had, all the time, rewrites. Something up with the cast, or a location: rewriting 24 hours a day. That's what you have to do. Yes, the others had a good time, I do think. Immersed themselves. There were... romances.</p> <p>'You know, I haven't actually watched it for about 20 years myself. It is a surprise, a delight, that people still like it. Local Hero never did massive business. It was well received, but it never made a pile, it wasn't in the year's top 10 films or anything. It washed its face, modestly. I think there's still some kind of financial record associated with Gregory's Girl. We made it for \u00a3200,000. Less, in fact. We had a great accountant, we actually handed \u00a38,000 back to the investors! So when that goes on to make five million or whatever - but these were different, different times.</p> <p>'Yes, you probably could still make Local Hero today, but I don't actually know who'd want to. Young film-makers today, they seem to have too much pressure on them to arrive with a film, their second or third or whatever, to make a big publicity statement. Rather than just, you know, make a film. With Local Hero, we were lucky with the funding, with the time it gave me to write: but we were slackers! We were stumbling into the limelight!</p> <p>'Also, I don't want you to think there was some deliberate message. You talk about the plot, but was there one? I mean, people can look back and say, oh, this was all an early one about the environment or whatever, but it didn't happen that way, or if it did it was accidental. I'm not political, either in film or personally, and I don't really do plot, and certainly don't aim to broadcast a \"message\". I suppose I like to tell stories. And if I'm writing a film, and don't really have a plot, then you have to fill the screen with something, so I try to do so with characters, incidents. The aurora borealis, for instance: I hadn't had any plans about that, but that year I was writing Local Hero I found myself up in Orkney, doing a short film for the BBC with Cyril Cusack, and I saw the aurora one night, first time ever, on the beach. So: that went in. It was all a bit like that.'</p> <p>Forsyth is still involved with films, collaborating this winter with his friend, producer Iain Smith, on something 'supernatural, cold, stark'. Age has, he says, brought him something: if not wisdom, then a smidgen more self-knowledge. 'To have, at this age, the realisation that maybe I got some things wrong is quite nice, in a way. The main problem is I think I was too full of irony, that laid-back irony. Watching from the wings. It's a very Scottish thing, holding up the kitchen wall at parties, casting comment from the sidelines. Hiding in the wings.

  "<p>The wave of bombings in West Germany, culminating on Wednesday in the death of three American soldiers when a parked car exploded at the United States Army headquarters at Heidelberg, may not yet have reached its peak.</p> <p>An urban guerrilla 'commando' has warned that there will be attacks in major cities next Friday, and proclaimed: 'The armed struggle has begun...only violence can help, when violence rules.'</p> <p>The attacks are deeply alarming the Government. Herr Genscher, Minister of the Interior, said that counter-intelligence squads would be enlarged. The head of the Federal Criminal Office booked 10 minutes of television on Thursday night to appeal to the public to act as detectives against the bombers.</p> <p>On Friday, Chancellor Brandt called an emergency conference of provincial Ministers of the Interior to study the problem. It seems likely that the urban guerrilla groups loosely united in the 'Red Army Faction' have become stronger in spite of a three-year manhunt.</p> <p>The nucleus was the group led by Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader, both still at large although several members of the band have been killed in gun battles, captured or have given themselves up. No direct evidence connects either Ulrike Meinhof or Baader with the present series of explosions, but the police are assuming that they are behind the affair.</p> <p>The first blast of this series killed an American major in Frankfurt on 9 May. Then police headquarters in Augsburg and Munich were bombed.</p> <p>On 15 May the wife of a judge investigating the Baader-Meinhof group was injured in Karlsruhe when a charge exploded as she turned the ignition key of her car. </p> <p>On 19 May 17 people were hurt, two gravely, when bombs went off in the Hamburg offices of the right-wing Axel Springer newspaper empire.</p> <p>After the Frankfurt explosion a message from the 'Petra Schelm Commando' of the Faction claimed that the bomb was a reprisal for American air attacks in Vietnam. Petra Schelm, a 20-year-old hairdresser, was killed last July in Hamburg during a machine-gun battle with the police.</p> <p>The warning for next Friday comes from a 'Thomas Weisbecker Commando' named after another 'Red Army' member shot in Augsburg this March.</p> <p>The sinister glamour of the original Baader-Meinhof group has created a legend and panic. Ulrike Meinhof, a dignified woman of 37, who once was a pacifist and edited a magazine in Hamburg, was converted to the doctrine of armed struggle by her experiences working with delinquent girls in Berlin.</p> <p>Andreas Baader, imprisoned for attempting to set fire to a department store in Frankfurt, was set free by a daring raid in Berlin several years ago. Both were among 'Red Army' members who escaped to Jordan and received training with the National Liberation Front before returning to Germany.</p> <p>So far, police have not caught any of the authors of this month's bombing campaign. But the explosions are speeding up the Government's already toughening policy on internal security. While passing 'liberal' foreign policy measures like the Warsaw and Moscow Treaties, the Social Democrat-Free Democrat Government has been systematically fighting what it calls 'the inner enemy'.</p> <p>Early this year, the provincial Prime Ministers passed the so-called Radicals Resolution, making it easier to ban from any sort of public post applicants who were connected with any group or party whose loyalty to the constitution could be considered doubtful.</p> <p>This is primarily intended to keep left-wingers out of the teaching profession. Hamburg has banned Communists and National Democrats (extreme rightists) from the Civil Service.</p> <p>In fact, both the German Communist Party (DKP) and most of the left-wing revolutionary groups strongly disapprove of urban guerrilla tactics. They have always feared that they would have to pay the bill for the violent exploits of the 'Red Army Faction' which has declared war on the whole apparatus of capitalist society.</p>",
  "<p>Novels about migrants are everywhere at present. In the past few months, Aleksander Hemon, Eva Hoffmann and Chris Cleave have all published books with migrant protagonists, and earlier this year Rose Tremain won the Orange Prize for The Road Home, her tale of an Eastern European economic migrant to Britain. Most of these writers can be said to approach the subject with optimism, in that they believe that the goal of making a successful life in a new country is eminently achievable. It's a view that is encouraged by the present-day reality of mass migration, as well as by the other accoutrements of globalisation. Thanks to travel, the internet and satellite television, the boundaries between countries seem more permeable than they used to, and these days when you move abroad you can take many aspects of your old life with you. </p> <p>It remains possible, though, to doubt whether migration can ever be a wholly successful enterprise, and this is broadly what Alaa al Aswany does in his new novel, Chicago. Like his last book, The Yacoubian Building, Chicago is an up-close portrait of an Egyptian community, although this time its members are not the residents of a Cairo apartment block but the students and faculty members of the University of Illinois Medical Centre. Chicago features almost as many characters as The Yacoubian Building did, and once again al Aswany charts their interlinked lives with impressive skill. As has often been pointed out, he is a rather old-fashioned writer, relying on well-crafted storylines and strongly defined characters. No doubt this has something to do with the wide appeal of his work, which sells well in both the Islamic world and the West. </p> <p>This is, however, an altogether darker, less straightforward and more problematic work than its predecessor. By shifting the location to America, al Aswany asks questions of his characters - all but a handful of whom are Egyptian - not demanded of those in The Yacoubian Building. To what extent is the immigrant obliged to remain loyal to his or her old country? Can people ever really cast off the identities into which they were born and become fully paid-up members of a new society? </p> <p>There is nothing trivial about such questions; you could say that the harmoniousness of much of the post-9/11 world depends on their answers. America, a nation of immigrants, is founded on the belief that old attachments can be transcended, whereas Islamic cultures tend to demand a strict obedience of their subjects that persists even when they move overseas. In presenting us with the collision of these two standpoints, al Aswany has written a novel that, if nothing else, feels extremely timely. </p> <p>His characters range in age from early twenties to late sixties, and they meet the challenges of their American life in different ways. At one extreme is Ra'fat Thabit, a professor of medicine, who sees everything about Egypt as 'backward' and has made it his ambition to be 'a complete genuine American, pure and without blemish'. At the other is Danana, the youngish head of the Egyptian Student Union in America, who plays the part of dedicated student while acting as a spy for the Egyptian secret police.</p> <p>Other characters attempt, perhaps more honestly, to inhabit the middle ground. There's Shaymaa, a talented medic from a humble background who falls in love with a fellow student and gradually abandons the strict sexual codes of her upbringing. And there's Nagi, a roguish dissident who embraces the sexual freedoms of America while taking every opportunity to plot the downfall of the Egyptian government. </p> <p>What none of the characters achieves, however, is a satisfactory balance between their Egyptian and American selves. Those who move too far away from their roots pay a heavy price: Ra'fat Thabit's only daughter shacks up with a drug addict, while Shaymaa gives up her virginity to a boyfriend who has no intention of marrying her. Those who cleave to their Egyptian identities don't fare any better: Danana's front of studiousness, for example, is exposed when his professor discovers he has cheated on a research project.</p> <p>Chicago's frequently light tone disguises the overall pessimism of its vision. The book suggests there is no real possibility of successfully transcending the cultural divide; national identities are fixed and impermeable. Any Egyptian who attempts to 'become' American will be condemned to an unhappy life. </p> <p>Al Aswany is perfectly entitled to these views, and he is correct to suggest that immigration is always a struggle. But the pessimism of the novel feels false in one respect, and this has to do with the way in which he presents America. While his understanding of Egyptian culture is subtle and nuanced, his understanding of America is crude. When he ventures beyond the confines of his Egyptian community, he often gets things comically wrong. One scene shows a black woman being publicly subjected to the kind of racism that was no longer possible in Martin Luther King's day; when another character takes a single line of cocaine, this instantly means she is an 'addict'. This is the world of bad Hollywood movies and anti-American propaganda, not of real life.</p> <p>Al Aswany is a realist novelist and so his work depends on us believing that what he is writing is in some sense true, or at least plausible. If one aspect of his vision is unrealistic, that jeopardises the entire edifice. But more than this, al Aswany's presentation of America detracts from his mostly subtle and humane analysis of the big themes his novel grapples with. If you are going to take on the 'clash of civilisations', then it seems important to give both sides of the clash a fair hearing. By depicting America in such a caricatured way, al Aswany makes the gulf between Islam and the West seem even wider than it is.</p>",
  "<p>Susie Boyt has adored Judy Garland since her first visit to the cinema, where she heard Dorothy singing 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'. As a lonely and sensitive child, every word Garland sang spoke directly to her. She took the singer to heart, wanting to love her and somehow become her. Now an adult, 'the imperative intimacy I feel with Judy Garland is similar to that which I feel for my mother and my children'. This is partly playful, partly deadly serious. Boyt truly believes in the moral dimension to her relationship with Judy Garland. It represents a belief in life and a belief in a better self, which can drag you out of the hellish bits of the everyday.</p> <p>My Judy Garland Life follows the trajectory of hero-worship, telling the story of one girl's attempt to overcome loneliness. But it has higher aims. The lessons Boyt has learnt from Garland are not small ones. 'All feelings, however painful, are to be prized. Glamour is a moral stance. Loss, its memory and its anticipation, lies at the heart of human experience.'</p> <p>This desire to create something profound out of something seemingly superficial makes for an extremely strange but rather wonderful undertaking. The book defies definition. It has elements of biography, autobiography, self-help and fan letter; although it's firmly non-fiction, there are parts that read like a novel. Above all, it is a bold experiment that sets out to map the boundaries of celebrity obsession, and somewhere along the way discovers what it means to be human. It is a defence of Judy Garland, as well as a defence of Boyt herself.</p> <p>It cannot help but be all the more fascinating because of Boyt's family connections. Freud was her great-grandfather and she grew up surrounded by adults who talked about psychoanalysis. Her father is painter Lucian Freud. Her parents separated before she was born and she rarely saw her father as a child. From the earliest age, she almost encouraged herself to feel others' pain. So it hardly seems surprising that she identified so strongly with Judy Garland.</p> <p>Despite the pathos in both stories, there is plenty of vaudeville and slapstick here, playing up to Boyt's fantasy that somehow she, too, could lead a Garland life, given half a chance. She learnt to dance as a girl ('Between 1976 and 1983, I attended almost 2,000 dancing classes') and was bitterly disappointed when her mother refused to let her attend the Italia Conti school because she was 'too intelligent'. She can be very funny, listing all the moments in her life when she has received back-handed compliments about her lack of talent as a singer and a dancer. She tells a friend she would have loved to be in musical theatre. This doesn't count as a regret, comes the reply, 'because to qualify as a regret something has to have been within the realms of possibility'. Another friend pours cold water on her fantasy of appearing in an amateur musical in a prison by warning that the standard would be too high.</p> <p>Boyt paints herself as the best kind of fan: admiring, adoring, but remaining at a respectful distance. But throughout the book, hovering in the background, tacitly acknowledged, is the spectre of the stalker. She knows she could easily overstep the mark; she would have loved to watch Garland sleep, she admits, as Diana Ross once asked to do. And when she finally meets Liza Minnelli, Garland's daughter, she has to restrain herself from collecting her cigarette butts and the remains of her club sandwich.</p> <p>What is most charming about this book is how brazen and irreverent it is. Boyt does not care if we don't like Judy Garland ('Come on, who doesn't love a show tune!' you can hear her cry). She doesn't mind if the book doesn't fit into a particular genre. She just wants to write her story. This devil-may-care confidence fits in well with the Garland myth: the book, like life, has a 'show must go on' quality, poised delicately between desperation and joy. It may well also be the first book ever to feature a mention of the website 'They Died on the Toilet' within a page of a reference to James Joyce. Boyt has created a universe where Derrida rubs shoulders with Sinatra and her great-grandfather Sigmund hangs out with Liza Minnelli. It is a fabulous place to be and, like an old Hollywood feelgood movie, at first I didn't want it to stop.</p> <p>By the close of My Judy Garland Life, though, I wasn't quite sure what, apart from beautiful, heartstopping writing, had pushed me to read to the end. Judy Garland died five months after Boyt was born so there is no real plot, no potential for encounter, aside perhaps from her quest to meet Liza Minnelli, Mickey Rooney and various other people connected to Garland.</p> <p>As there is no mystery to solve, what you are left with is gaps. Boyt seems apprehensive about delving too deeply into what her obsession really says about her relationship with her father. Judy Garland only exists as an absence in her life, just as her father was in her childhood. She only hints at the difficulties she has endured in this regard, including a troubling episode when her father promised to do a painting for her and then didn't. But perhaps this is part of the beauty of the book. Boyt gives away more about her real reasons for allowing Judy Garland so far into her life by not saying very much about them at all.</p> <p>The most revealing moment comes when she tries to ask Liza Minnelli directly about her mother. Instead, Boyt suddenly finds herself confessing that she is in awe of her own father and that other people's excessive interest in him makes her very uncomfortable. 'But don't you understand where they're coming from?' Minnelli replies.</p>",
  "<h2>No</h2> <p><strong>Leo Hickman, journalist and ethical living adviser</strong></p> <p>When you jump off that chair lift for the first time every season, fill your lungs with frigid air and glance at that mountain vista ahead, it's hard not to feel a connection with nature. Immersing yourself in this environment is arguably one of skiing's key attractions. </p> <p>But strip away the glamour and the thrills and you are left with a list of environmental woes. And that's not taking into account the fact that the busiest slope in any ski region is the line of aircraft descending to the airport. You cannot talk about skiing without mentioning climate change. Skiers, of all people, should be aware of the rapid changes occurring on the world's mountain ranges. Glaciers are in speedy retreat and snow lines are rising quickly. </p> <p>Skiers are not directly causing these problems, other than by being members of the human race. But the skiing industry is frantically, forlornly, trying to stave off the deleterious effects of climate change with a series of measures that will only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The arrival of snow cannons at virtually every major resort over the past decade is the most worrying of trends. Working through the night as the skiers' attention turns to the delights of schnapps and fondue, these spray particles of water mixed with nucleating agents into the freezing air to create a blanket of artificial snow. A lack of the real stuff has forced the industry to rely on these machines, but their environmental impact is considerable.</p> <p>Mountain Wilderness, a French conservation group that described skiing as 'the cancer of the Alps', says that 4,000 cubic metres of water are needed to cover one hectare of piste for a season - whereas a hectare of corn needs only 1,700. Across the Alps, it is estimated that artificial snow consumes the same amount of water each year as 1.5 million people. Incredibly, in some regions, tap water is used, but elsewhere river water is extracted from the valleys below and pumped back up the mountain. </p> <p>This causes two problems. First, there is the energy expenditure: Mountain Wilderness says that it requires about 25,000 kilowatt-hours, costing about \u20ac150,000, to cover just one hectare of piste with snow for a season (that's largely why the cost of ski passes has risen so much in recent years). Second, dumping river water at high altitude disrupts biodiversity because it introduces nutrients in the water into an area where they wouldn't otherwise be. </p> <p>Using artificial snow also means that the pistes now take up to a month longer than normal to melt in the summer, preventing many plant species lying dormant underneath from germinating and flowering, leading to huge muddy scars in the summer meadows where the pistes once lay. Just take a look on Google Earth at satellite images of, say, the Chamonix valley or Aspen during the summer months.</p> <p>'Artificial snow is not the root of all evil, but it is very close,' says Sergio Savoia, the programme director of WWF Switzerland. 'One of the biggest problems is psychological: snow cannons give tourists the idea that it is business as usual. But we don't actually have much snow.'</p> <p>Some low-lying resorts are experiencing winter nights that are too warm even to use snow cannons. There are reports that helicopters are being used to ferry snow to threadbare pistes in order to keep these resorts in business. In 2002, Italian police set up a task force to investigate the 'theft' of snow from glaciers by the truck load in order to serve nearby resorts. The alternative is to abandon such resorts and chase the snow, by building new lifts and hotels further up the mountain. This is already being seen in some places. </p> <p>But, despite the promises of resort owners, how environmentally sensitive can a concrete mixer really be when taken high up into a wilderness area and put to work?</p> <p>\u2022 Leo Hickman is the author of The Final Call: Investigating Who Really Pays for Our Holidays (Transworld)</p> <h2>Yes</h2> <p><strong>Veronica Tonge, responsible travel consultant</strong></p> <p>Many people take the view that the downhill ski industry ruins the environment, consumes vast amounts of energy and cannot possibly be in harmony with the principles of responsible or sustainable tourism. However, it has been the saviour of many mountain communities and traditions, halting the depopulation and poverty that occurred at the end of the 19th century.</p> <p>It requires positive action, however, for a sport such as skiing, with its requirement for lifts, pistes and artificial snow, to operate on a green basis. </p> <p>Ski lifts and artificial snow-making do require power for the ski season; but they are increasingly efficient and clean since they no longer run on diesel and the electricity can come from renewable sources. Many resorts in Europe derive nearly all their power from hydroelectricity and, in America, Vail Resorts became one of the world's largest corporate users of renewable energy when it switched its five resorts and offices to use wind power.</p> <p>Lech in Austria has reduced its CO2 emissions further and improved air quality by building a biomass plant to provide heat and hot water to the resort and by providing a free public bus service to remove the need for cars. Therefore, staying for a week there could result in negligible emissions. </p> <p>So what about the chemicals in the artificial snow and the vast quantities of water it requires? Resorts have used proteins to help the artificial snow freeze at higher temperatures; however, studies have been inconclusive on the impacts. Nonetheless, some resorts have never used them, such as those in the Austrian Tyrol where the artificial snow is made from pure water - evidenced by the certified organic pastures underneath. The water is either taken from rivers or reservoirs built to store rainwater up the mountain. In Austria, the reservoirs have to undergo environmental impact assessments before construction and often end up blending so harmoniously that summer walks are routed to them. The rivers are assessed to work out the exact amount of water that can be safely taken out without damage to the wildlife and this water is even filtered to ensure that it is pure. </p> <p>And what about the delayed snowmelt? We have all seen mountains where the only snow remaining is that of the piste of artificial snow. Repeated scientific studies have found no negative impacts of artificial snow or delayed snowmelt on vegetation and, in the same way a plastic bag protects your favourite garden plants from spring frosts, artificial snow has been found to operate in the same way for the Alpine vegetation.</p> <p>Pistes are the other requirement for skiing. Although some have been created by bulldozing the mountain, there is a new technique called the 'soil push' method, whereby the topsoil and vegetation is removed as 'turf', the land is machine-graded underneath and then the topsoil is re-laid, which effectively keeps all the plant and insect diversity intact as before. Some resorts are reducing the need for prepared pistes altogether by reclassifying advanced runs as 'itinerary' routes which are not prepared or groomed, providing exciting challenges for experienced skiers.</p> <p>So can you ski and keep your green conscience clear? Yes, but only if you select your resort carefully. Check websites such as the Ski Club of Great Britain (<a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">skiclub.co.uk</a>) and Save our Snow (<a href=\"http://www.saveoursnow.com\">saveoursnow.com</a>) for lists of resorts that are taking positive environmental steps, but do your own research, too, by checking out the resort's own websites. They are increasingly realising that green credentials can win them more visitors. Choose the right resort and your conscience can be as clear as the mountain air.</p> <p>\u2022 Veronica Tonge is the author of several reports analysing the impacts of skiing</p> <h2>Resorts with a green stamp</h2> <p><strong>Aspen, Colorado</strong><br>Aspen has a stingent green building policy, with projects such as the Snowmass Golf Clubhouse, which is one of the most energy-efficient commercial buildings in the state.

  "<p>Harold Robbins, the master at churning out bestselling doorstopper novels while wearing unfeasibly large glasses and eye-watering shirts, told stories nonstop throughout his adult years. He made up almost every element of his own life too, re-embellishing on a regular basis. </p> <p>And yet it turns out he had fairly straightforward insight into his success. 'I just happen to think I've done better than anyone else in reflecting the times in which I live,' he once said. 'My books are about today. I am never writing yesterday's story ... '</p> <p>The Man Who Invented Sex, by the first writer who bothered to ferret out the real facts behind the life of Robbins, looks absolutely right in a paperback edition. After all, it contains much of the salacious detail of one of Robbins's airport bonkbusters and should perhaps only be read in public hidden inside another book, in the manner adopted by one of his many mothers-in-law.</p> <p>Dubbed 'The Thrill Peddler' by Alan Whicker, Robbins began his career as a lowly New York grocer before moving into accountancy, working on budgets for the movie industry. It was here he picked up much of the lewd gossip that fleshed out his novels and developed the financial acumen that drove his attitude to the business of producing fiction.</p> <p>According to Wilson, the young Robbins, overhearing one day that Gone With the Wind was a valuable 'property', not just a book, vowed to write one for himself. Sure enough, by 1968 his titles occupied seven out of the 10 places in a New York Times list of the bestselling books of all time; the only other fiction listed was Margaret Mitchell's great Southern saga itself.</p> <p>Amusingly, Wilson starts many of his chapters in the style of Robbins's own work, so it would be neat enough to suggest that this biography romps along just as racily as The Carpetbaggers or Never Love a Stranger, especially since Robbins's slide from rags to riches to debauchery fits the bill so well. But in truth, Wilson's book is much more involving and revealing of the era it describes than any Robbins rollercoaster could ever be.</p>",

  "<p>When I first met Ulrike Meinhof, before she took up the gun, I thought her tender and vulnerable. As The Observer's correspondent in Germany, I had gone to interview her in Hamburg for a left-wing view of the poverty and exploitation hidden behind the shiny 'economic miracle'. I found her in a suburban house, a nervous, pretty woman of 30 with two blonde little girls rolling round her feet.</p> <p>At that time - it was 1964 - she was editing the political journal konkret, and already making a name as one of Germany's most eloquent columnists. Politically, she was a pacifist and committed to the nuclear disarmament campaign, like her strong-minded, idealistic foster mother, Renate Riemeck, who had adopted Meinhof and her sister after the death of their parents.</p> <p>After the interview, we talked a bit. She was having trouble, she confessed, with the Socialist Students' League (SDS), which was trying to cast her out for lack of Marxist vigour. They despised her pacifism. 'They call me a peace-loving egg-pancake,' she said sadly. Both of us agreed that some sort of revolt was brewing, especially in the universities.</p> <p>But neither of us guessed that three years later the SDS would lead a revolutionary upsurge which would shake the state's foundations. Least of all did I - or she - imagine that this shy, self-critical person would become an international symbol of violence when that upsurge weakened and she found herself leading the most feared terrorist group in Germany, responsible for 47 deaths.</p> <p>In 1968, she left her husband and her good job, and moved to Berlin. I was living there, and a message came from Riemeck asking me through a mutual friend to 'keep an eye on Ulrike, because she'll be lonely'. I never got round to looking her up. But she was meeting far more exciting company: Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, who had already been convicted for setting fire to a department store ('the Vietnam experience').</p> <p>Counselling girl delinquents, Ulrike became convinced that they were victims of the system who should be trained to fight and smash it, not to adapt to it. Soon afterwards, when Baader was re-arrested in 1970, Meinhof planned and took part in a daring shoot-out to rescue him and herself went underground.</p> <p>Ensslin urged her to get rid of the children, both then still aged under 10. After first refusing, she gave in. They were spirited out of Germany and dumped in a hippy commune in Sicily. She did not see them again until they visited her in prison two years later.</p> <p>Last weekend, the audience trickling out of Cologne's biggest cinema looked shattered. Earlier, as they waited to see the premiere of The Baader-Meinhof Complex, they had been in high spirits: the city's young, sparky, arthouse mob laughing and sipping white wine.</p> <p>In the cinema, their happy mood drained away. Two-and-a-half hours later, as the credits began to roll, there was at first silence and then only quiet, stunned applause.</p> <p>The film itself is powerful, showing the foul reality of urban guerrilla struggle and what it does to its victims and its perpetrators. But the myth of the Baader-Meinhof group is powerful too, still haunting German imaginations more than a generation later. The young people who see the film now were not born when it all happened. And yet the German past now intrigues them, in contrast to the deliberate deafness of their parents to their own recent history. Other films with a historical basis - Downfall and The Lives of Others - have pulled big attendances.</p> <p>That Cologne audience, utterly opposed to terrorist violence, nonetheless felt a pang of sympathy with the protagonists. Thirty years ago, would they have turned away those terrorist boys and girls if they had come begging for shelter? Would they have called the police?</p> <p>This film provides no easy answers. Many Germans seem to find it admirable, including - surprisingly - the children of some of the gang's victims. Others are outraged, seeing it as a glamorisation of terror. One right-wing critic said bitterly: 'It doesn't clear away the myth... It gives it a new foundation'.</p> <p>The roots of the Baader-Meinhof group (the 'Red Army Faction' or RAF) were in the revolutionary student movement which swept West Berlin and West Germany between 1967 and 1969. While the movement acted mainly through mass demonstrations, permitting only 'symbolic counter-violence against objects', its rage against the American war in Vietnam ('genocide') was incandescent.</p> <p>So was its hatred of the West German state, an economic triumph which had preserved suffocatingly authoritarian structures in the universities and not least in the police, trained to regard all protest as Communist subversion.</p> <p>In West Berlin, I soon began to meet angry young militants who thought that the student movement should stop waving posters at the state and attack it physically. Events soon gave them force. I was there on 2 June 1967, at a demonstration against the Shah of Persia, when the police ran wild and shot dead the student Benno Ohnesorg. And I remember the tears of impotent fury and grief all around me when Rudi Dutschke, the Danton of the SDS, was gunned down by a hyped-up boy screaming 'Communist swine!'</p> <p>So it seemed that there was already a war on. To take up arms against the imperialist killers, to act and fight, seemed to some like an ethical response.</p> <p>One of these radicals was Andreas Baader, an unstable tearaway with devastating charisma and a taste for violence. Born in 1943, he had lost his father in the war and grew up a spoiled child bullying a household of women. As a teenager, he stole motorbikes, wrecked cars and enjoyed pub brawls. In 1963 he moved to West Berlin to avoid military service, became involved in the 'bohemian' political scene and acquired a taste for natty dressing unusual in that milieu. Here he met his true love, the extraordinary Gudrun Ensslin.</p> <p>Daughter of a deeply serious and compassionate Lutheran minister in Swabia, herself highly intelligent and socially conscious, she spent a year at a Methodist college in America, where she was shocked into radical socialist politics.</p> <p>Back in West Berlin, she became totally disillusioned with the ruling Social Democrats and with all conventional morality. In 1968 she met Baader, went fire-bombing stores with him and landed in jail. It was in prison that she met Ulrike Meinhof, who had come to interview her.</p> <p>The culmination of that friendship was the 1970 springing of Andreas Baader. Afterwards the gang, now growing in numbers, went to Lebanon for military training with Palestinian guerrillas. Back in Germany, the shooting war began with a series of spectacular bank raids and clashes with the police, In May 1972 came lethal bomb attacks on American army bases, once accepted as West Germany's defence against Soviet invasion but now seen as integral to the hated Vietnam war. German prosecutors and right-wing newspaper offices were also targets.</p> <p>By now, the 'Baader-Meinhof Gang' was obsessing West German politicians and dominating the media. There were deaths - American soldiers, German policemen and the first Red Army Faction victim: Petra Schelm. She was only one of many young women fighting in the group and leading its 'commandos'.</p> <p>Around the group, there was soon a wide 'sympathiser' network of people who shared the RAF aims, even though they rejected their terrorist methods. Opinion polls showed that one in four West Germans under 30 felt 'a certain sympathy'. In liberal northern Germany, one in 10 was prepared to shelter a RAF fugitive.</p> <p>Soon after the bombings, in June 1972, the police's luck changed. They cornered Andreas Baader and two of his comrades in a Hamburg garage; Baader was wounded and captured. A week later, Ensslin was caught in a Hamburg boutique. The ruthless Brigitte Mohnhaupt was arrested in Berlin and Meinhof was betrayed by her host in a Hanover flat.</p> <p>Baader, Ensslin and Meinhof, with several other RAF fighters, ended up in a specially constructed super-prison at Stammheim, near Stuttgart. But meanwhile the 'second wave' RAF went into action. In April 1975, they stormed the West German embassy in Stockholm, took hostages and demanded the release of the Stammheim prisoners.</p> <p>The siege ended in carnage and failure. The following month, the trial of the Stammheim three, plus Jan-Carl Raspe, began its chaotic and often farcical three-year course. But Meinhof did not see the end of it. Tormented by a sense of failure, and bullied for weakness by Baader and Ensslin, she hanged herself in May 1976.</p> <p>Outside, the 'second wave' was preparing a new campaign, after a group had undergone training in South Yemen. And in 1977 they launched the crescendo of horror and tragedy which is now remembered as 'the German Autumn' - although it began in spring.</p> <p>In April, the chief federal prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, and his bodyguard were killed by motorcycle gunmen (or possibly women) as their car waited at traffic lights. On 30 July, the banker J\u00fcrgen Ponto was fatally wounded by Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar in a bungled kidnap attempt, meant to spring the Stammheim survivors. On 5 September, the gang successfully abducted Hanns-Martin Schleyer, chairman of the employers' federation, after killing his driver and escorts.</p> <p>Again, they demanded the release of the prisoners and a plane to fly them to the Middle East. The government stalled. Mohnhaupt persuaded Palestinian militants to hijack a Lufthansa jet. It was done, but no country in the region would accept the plane, which eventually landed at Mogadishu in Somalia. There, on 17 October, it was stormed by German special forces and the passengers released.</p> <p>Next morning, Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were found dead in their cells. The two men had apparently shot themselves with smuggled pistols; Ensslin had hanged herself. A fourth prisoner, Irmgard M\u00f6ller, had stab wounds but survived.</p> <p>Two days later, Schleyer was taken to a wood on the Dutch/German border and executed. Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were buried in Stuttgart among emotional crowds raising clenched fists. For years, the orthodoxy of the German far left insisted that they and Meinhof had been murdered in their cells. Some still believe it.</p> <p>That is where the film ends. But the book by Stefan Aust on which it is based, a revised edition with the same title as the film, takes the story further. The Stammheim deaths were not quite the end of the RAF. Some of them took refuge in East Germany, where they were protected and given new identities by the Stasi. In the 1980s, another string of murders began, targeting mostly industrialists and bankers.</p> <p>It was not until 1998 that the authorities received a bulletin announcing that the urban guerrilla movement was over. The communiqu\u00e9 ended with the words: 'The Revolution says: I was, I am, I will be'....</p> <p>So why are they remembered so acutely, these intelligent young men and women who turned to terrorism? Why did that Cologne audience creep out into the autumn night looking as if they had been mugged? In Britain, such people would be regarded as mere criminals, their gun-slinging career not without glamour but their political ideas of no possible interest. In Germany, even 40 years on, it is different.</p> <p>There is a whole shelf of older movies about Baader-Meinhof, most of them elegiac and to some degree defensive. The Baader-Meinhof Complex sets out neither to condemn or excuse. The method adopted by producer Bernd Eichinger (Oscar-nominated for his work on Downfall) is to throw at the viewer one astonishing scene after another without stringing them together into some psychological narrative. He calls this technique Fetzendramaturgie - the drama of fragments. You and I can put the fragments together into any pattern we please.</p> <p>The main characters - Baader, Ensslin and Meinhof - are allowed to say what they actually did say , especially at the outset of their campaign. And what they said is now repeated with all the professional skill and force of some of Germany's best actors. And the result - an unnerving one - is that the arguments begin to convince.</p> <p>Here sit these nice Cologners from a liberal, reunited, 21st-century Germany, safe inside the eurozone. And yet as they listen to Martina Gedeck as Ulrike Meinhof or Johanna Wokalek as Gudrun Ensslin, they find themselves tempted to agree that they had no alternative but to take up arms.</p> <p>And then the logic leads down into darkness, into places where arguments are no longer about noble ends but about whether you can harden yourself to use terrible means. Meinhof relied much on words by Bertolt Brecht: 'If you could change the world at last/ What would be beneath you? .../ Sink in the dirt,/ Embrace the slaughterer./ But change the world; the world needs it.'</p> <p>They certainly embraced the slaughterers. After those first seven years of urban guerrilla war, 47 people were dead, including most of the group's original members. They sank in the dirt: the murders, especially those in the final 'autumn', had a quality of forced viciousness about them, a revelry in blood, which is truly evil.</p> <p>As for changing the world, they failed. All they achieved was to make West Germany a less tolerant, more paranoid society than it had been before. Laws passed in panic banned all 'radicals' (whatever that meant) from public service. Worst of all, the RAF terror campaign weakened the whole democratic left in Germany. The 'Wanted' posters, with faces crossed out in red as each was caught or killed, blazed on the walls of every police station, railway station, airport or frontier post. The 1968 visions of a new world of freedom, peace and fraternity were themselves driven underground.</p> <p>In notes made in Stammheim, Meinhof tried to explain the RAF's mission. 'Nauseated by the... system, the total commercialisation and absolute mendacity... deeply disappointed by the actions of the student movement... they thought it essential to spread the idea of armed struggle.' They were not so blind, she went on, as to think that they would bring about revolution in Germany, or that they would not be killed and imprisoned. The point was to 'salvage historically the whole state of understanding attained by the movement of 1967/68; it was a case of not letting the struggle fall apart again.'</p> <p>These are words with long echoes in the German past. Not really in the Nazi past, although many foreigners assume that the Baader-Meinhof gang were simply rebelling against the Nazi generation of their parents. Neither Stefan Aust's book nor Bernd Eichinger's film suggests that, and they are right not to. These echoes are from other places in German history: from the tradition of doomed struggle, fighting to the end in order to leave a message for the future.</p> <p>This is about the poet Georg B\u00fcchner's failed revolution in the 1830s ('Peace to the cottages! War on the palaces!'). It is about Eugen Levin\u00e9, who led a Munich revolution in 1919 which he knew was hopeless and was shot for it ('We are all dead men on leave'). It is about the plotters against Hitler, who hoped not to survive but to atone ('For the sake of 10 righteous men, may the city be spared').</p> <p>Those were all better causes than the RAF's. But the idea - the revolution as a message in a bottle, cast into the ocean from a drowning ship - still floats down into the present.</p> <p>The book and the film have the same title. But they are very different artefacts. The book was originally published in 1985 by Stefan Aust, a Spiegel journalist who had known some of the gang before they went underground. He himself arranged the benevolent kidnap of Ulrike Meinhof's small daughters, when he discovered that the RAF had decided to dump them in a Palestinian orphanage.</p> <p>Aust wrote a minutely detailed and closely researched account, which has now been brought up to date to take in new information from the Stasi files and elsewhere. It's especially good on the years at Stammheim, where the authorities committed every possible error, above all by keeping the prisoners in collective isolation as a group.</p> <p>The film, directed by Uli Edel, is also minutely detailed. It's brilliant, it's fearsomely convincing. But then, because this is a film about the perpetrators and not the victims, the sheer power of the telling has upset some citizens. They ask: 'Whose side are you on?' The film-makers would retort that they are on no side, just telling it as it was.</p> <p>Another criticism is that the RAF actors are so good-looking. Were they really so gorgeous? A few certainly were. Meinhof was more attractive than she seems here, while Ensslin - gauntly elegant - was less disco-sexy than Johanna Wokalek makes her. But the point about looks is political. One critic in Welt am Sonntag complained that the screen Baader and Ensslin were like Germany's answer to Bonnie and Clyde - a slander on both movies. But he went on to say that The Baader-Meinhof Complex 'brings to light a repressed truth about the allure of the RAF. Girls with guns are the ultimate desire and fear fantasy of a patriarchal, inhibited society.'</p> <p>Meinhof would have agreed with that. So might Ensslin. A wonderful scene in the film shows her strutting naked in the Lebanese sun, jeering at shocked Palestinian recruits. 'What's the matter? Fucking and shooting; it's the same thing!'</p> <p>In Europe's endless quest for true liberation, the RAF perished on the dirtiest and darkest of short cuts. They deserved to. But it was the same search.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Baader Meinhof Complex is released on 14 November</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> A revised edition of The Baader-Meinhof Complex by Stefan Aust is published in paperback by Random House on 6 Nov</p> <h2>Red Army Faction: The main players</h2> <p><strong>Andreas Baader</strong></p> <p>Elegantly dressed, charismatic and violent, Baader was one of the founder members of the Red Army Faction who developed a taste for radical politics after moving to west Berlin in 1963.

  "<p>It is generally considered poor form, when you are ostensibly a grown-up, to weep because you can't reverse park your car. But here I am, in an empty car park in north London, early in the morning, howling because I haven't backed into bay nine. It might be acceptable were I alone, but I'm not - my extraordinarily patient driving instructor, Gary Lamb, is taking this display of childish petulance in his stride, as he does everything, including our frequently shared near-death experiences. I am crying because my driving test is two weeks away, and in spite of six months of lessons, I seem to be getting worse.</p> <p>However, this is not true: I am not getting worse, and the very fact that I am sitting in a driving seat at all is a miracle directly attributable to Gary. Ten years ago, when I learned to drive the first time, two things happened: first, I discovered that I hated driving, was rubbish at it, and felt very strongly that I was in no way sensible enough to be given control of a hulking ball of metal with an accelerator. Second, one night I arrived at the aftermath of an accident in which a drunk driver killed someone I knew, and I more or less never got back into the driving seat. </p> <p>For years after, I was a terrible, hysterical passenger, jumping out of friends' cars at traffic lights if they drove too fast or sitting rigid with fear. I never wanted to learn to drive again - and anyway could always kid myself that it was an eco decision (which rings very hollow if you count the number of lifts I've blagged). But by late last year, work had become tricky without a licence, people were sick of ferrying me about like a princess and I realised I'd spent well over \u00a3250 in a single month on taxis. </p> <p>All of which led me to Gary at BSM Baker Street, who is specially trained to teach panic-addled lunatics like me (actually, he's trained to teach pretty much anyone to drive pretty much anything: he's a sort of driving guru). Since I was too scared to get into the actual car, the first few lessons took place in BSM's driving simulator - working through the programme's different levels, I could plough into the verge without hurting anyone, stall without being rear-ended, and remember where the gears were. In fact, I would quite happily have continued puttering around BSM's one-dimensional traffic system forever. Gary was having none of that, though, and calmly lured me into a real car with the proviso that we'd 'just have a little look at the controls, maybe turn the engine on and off'. This was all part of his cunning plan, and before I knew what was happening he'd got me to move off and do all sorts of crazy manoeuvres, turning corners and everything. </p> <p>This pattern was repeated over the next few months: I'd be pootling along a quiet side road, when he'd make me turn left, and I'd unexpectedly find myself on a dual carriageway, too near certain death to have the panic attack I'd have preferred. Yes, I finished each lesson an emotional wreck, but before I knew it I could more or less drive, and Gary had made me book a test. Three weeks ago I passed, vindicating his opinion (not mine) that I'm a pretty decent driver.</p> <p>No doubt it won't be the last time I cry over a space, but at least now I know I'll be able to park when I finally find an empty one.</p> <p>\u2022 BSM (08457 276 276; <a href=\"http://www.bsm.co.uk\">bsm.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Building types are not what they used to be. I've noticed a trend for building-society premises to become high-concept Cornish pasty shops and have lost count of banks translated into pubs. And galleries are shape-shifting too. </p> <p>Rarely are Eastbourne and Chelsea mentioned in the same architectural (or cultural, social, artistic, sexual, gastronomic) paragraph, but right now the seaside Sussex gerontopolis and the perfumed, Audi-rich hinterlands of Sloane Square are competing with two of the most interesting galleries of recent years. (They'll be joined next year by London's Whitechapel, remodelled to the tune of \u00a310 million.) </p> <p>In Eastbourne, the old carpark site next to the Congress Theatre will soon be a new home for the Towner Gallery. In Chelsea, the drill hall of Pevsner's 'sturdy Tuscan portico' that fronts the 1801 Royal Military Asylum for the Children of Soldiers' Widows (more recently known as the Duke of York's) will next month open as the new permanent home of the notorious, wandering Saatchi.</p> <p>We use the word 'gallery' to describe an art museum because of Italian precedents. In Rome the Galleria of the Vatican displayed earth-bound Papal wealth while in Florence the Corridoio Vasariano was (and is) a splendid overground gallery linking the Pitti with Uffizi, designed to display Medici art with the intention of boggling the minds of visiting ambassadors and supplicants. But makeovers rather than new-build defined the two most interesting London galleries of the late 20th century. The first was The Boilerhouse Project in the Victoria &amp; Albert. This opened in what had been a fetid basement in early 1982. It was made possible by three people. First, Terence Conran who was passionate to proselytise about modern design and willing to put his money where his proselytiser was. Second, Sir Roy Strong, who said to me (I was the third person involved): 'Oooh, just get on with it, darling'. </p> <p>Getting on with it involved stripping back the old boilerhouse yard to make it a coruscating white-tiled box so harshly zeitgeisty that it was used in the credits for The Money Programme on the telly and the part of it that was my office was trialled as background for commercials about headache cures. The Boilerhouse's exhibitions about design made it 'London's most successful gallery of the Eighties', according to Arena. Since Arena was the most successful magazine of the Eighties, this must be true.</p> <p>The second significant gallery of the period was the Saatchi on Boundary Road in London's well-upholstered St John's Wood. This was an old paint factory superbly tightened and brightened by the late Max Gordon, an architect with connections to and influence in the New York art world. (Significantly, it was the same Max Gordon who found the site for Conran's Design Museum, another white box that opened in 1989.) Gordon's Saatchi Gallery was like the most magnificent imaginable SoHo loft.</p> <p>It opened in 1985. Here Charles Saatchi exhibited artists difficult at the time to find in this country: Donald Judd, Brice Marden and Cy Twombly, for example. It was an astonishingly wonderful, dramatic and beautiful place whose influence was only limited because St John's Wood is a lush backwater. Cleverly, Saatchi extended his influence by outreach. After all, if an adman does not understand marketing, distribution and demographics who does? Saatchi properties displayed at the Royal Academy in 1992 created the Young British Artist phenomenon and all the rest was... market-making.</p> <p>The Saatchi Gallery's move to London's County Hall in 2003 was only a mixed success. Although it became central, it lost credibility and energy. Being next to a tacky aquarium and a low-concept permanent Salvador Dali exhibition somehow located Saatchi in circus culture. Moreover, the architecture of County Hall was inappropriate and stifling and, besides, Charles himself seemed to have lost interest. It was rumoured he now preferred go-karting. So the new Saatchi Gallery is a welcome sign of resurrection.</p> <p>Architects AHMM spent three years looking for an appropriate site and, coincidence or not, eventually found one very close to Saatchi's Eaton Square home. It is a fine historic building in a beautiful wooded and grassy setting. AHMM stripped back the innards to reveal the underlying geometry and created 15 spacious new galleries on three floors. They are boldly white, sparely finished and top-lit, designed to create a recessive background for London's reclusive modern Medici. If they are recessive it is not because of a limited budget: none has been declared, but we may be certain Charles Saatchi does not stint himself. Anyway, this sort of recession is surely the right thing because so many art gallery designs - the Guggenheims in New York and Bilbao and the National Gallery extensions in London and Washington - fail because the showy architecture overwhelms the subtleties of painting.</p> <p>The new Saatchi Gallery will be a huge success, but the new Towner Gallery in Eastbourne is perhaps even more interesting since it can enjoy the strange pleasures and atmospheres which attend provincial galleries: many of them still carry that faint aroma of beeswax only barely disguising the shocking radicalism and missionary bohemianism represented by cautious nudes and rumours of subterranean life classes. Londoners, fatigued by excess, may not be shocked by Wolfgang Tillmans (and there is a striking one in the Towner's permanent collection). You can bet someone in Eastbourne will be.</p> <p>The Towner Gallery has a fascinating history. From 1923 to 2005 it was in a fine 18th-century manor house in Eastbourne's Old Town. Its first curator, Arthur Reeve Fowkes, had connections to the St Ives School and, to complement a foundation of topographical pictures, slowly built up a fine collection of English art including Edward Burra, Edward Wadsworth and Christopher Wood. Best of all, the Towner has the world's outstanding collection of Eric Ravilious, a local teacher who for my money was Britain's outstanding 20th-century artist. Because of this, in 1962 The Observer described the Towner as 'the most go ahead municipal gallery' in the country.</p> <p>So when in 2005 it was decided to turn the gallery's home into flats, a mighty engine of grant applications and local authority fixing for a new venue was started up. Curator Matthew Rowe came to Eastbourne from Tate St Ives. A competition was announced through the Official Journal of the European Union. More than 80 entries were received. Rick Mather Architects were selected not least because they were prepared to take Eastbourne seriously.</p> <p>The site is next door to the Congress Theatre, a 1963 landmark of modernismo now Grade II-listed and much admired by amateurs of period concrete. To develop a brief, Rowe travelled with the architects to see some noteworthy new small gallery spaces in Europe: Peter Zumthor's Kunsthaus in Bregenz, 1992 and Herzog and de Meuron's Schaulager in Basel, 2003, among them. Back in Sussex, they built a small jewel. </p> <p>Light is the enemy of art, so the street facade is a mixture of cladding with white-painted concrete and only exiguous daylight-openings. Major structural elements are in exposed fair-faced (that is to say: glass-smooth) concrete: the structure of sometimes daringly spanned posts and lintels is visible throughout. Outside, the square-on facade becomes voluptuous volumes around the side.</p> <p>The Towner design is modest only in the intelligent sense: budget restraints mean that goods and people have to share one giant lift. Visitors are ingeniously led through the levels of the building because the handsome staircase (solid black steel plate where there might have been banisters) rises through one floor at a time and exits at different ends. Through the balcony of the cafe is a view of redbrick and tile-hung late 19th-century Eastbourne. </p> <p>Through the biggest windows in the building: a fine view of the startlingly green championship tennis courts. Rowe has \u00a31m from the Art International Fund to spend on new acquisitions, but Miss Joan Hunter Dunn and I would just as soon see this fine building devoted in its entirety to the delightful and whimsical Eric Ravilious. And topographical watercolours in polite gilt frames would look gorgeous against its severe white modern walls. Still, splendid to have the choice.</p> <p>In the cab back to the station I pondered the nature of galleries. Agreeable spaces, controlled lighting, hints of the incongruous or transgressive licensed by the sanctity of art. Why do I find the Towner perhaps a little more interesting than the Saatchi? Something to do, perhaps, with the dissonant glory of great art in bingo and variety show territory. That mysterious surreal mood caught in Auden's 'Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts' or Eliot's 'Prufrock' in whose room the women 'come and go, talking of Michelangelo'. Eastbourne seems somehow more adventurous: Edward Burra on the South Coast is more of a challenge than Dinos Chapman in Chelsea. 'Oh do not ask \"what is it\"/Let us go and make our visit.' I think we should.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The new Saatchi Gallery opens on 9 Oct (<a href=\"http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\">saatchi-gallery.co.uk</a>); to see pictures go to <a href=\"http://www.ahmm.co.uk\">ahmm.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>Experimental law variations? Pah. This was a crackerjack of a match in which both sides played with ambition, fluency and skill. They shared six tries, though Harlequins will be kicking themselves all the way to Worcester on Thursday after allowing London Irish to transform a 20-3 deficit shortly before the interval into a thrilling victory. </p> <p>Quins, indeed, were in danger of failing even to garner a losing bonus point until Danny Care plunged over with two minutes remaining and they could then even have won an enthralling contest as they plotted their way up field with time having expired. Alas for them, Tom Williams knocked on under no pressure and Irish were able to breathe a huge sigh of relief. It was, frankly, a pity that either side had to lose. </p> <p>It was Quins who were quicker out of the blocks and after Peter Hewat and Chris Malone had traded early penalty goals - the latter a result of a horrible drop by Seilala Mapusua from a long throw at a defensive lineout and Irish falling offside at the subsequent five-metre scrum - Quins conjured a quite delightful try.</p> <p>After Tom Guest delivered some perfect off-the-top ball at a lineout on halfway, Malone released David Strettle, who ran a marvellous line to take an inside pass at pace from his stand off before an electrifying 40-metre burst took the sometime England wing to within spitting distance of the Exiles' line. The ball was quickly recycled, Ugo Monye squeezed over in the left corner and Quins were 10-3 to the good, following Malone's touchline conversion. </p> <p>Strettle's contribution should certainly have impressed Brian Smith, the watching England attack coach, but it was also a move which demonstrated that the ELVs, though some of them are clearly ill-conceived, do not necessarily have to make for negative rugby. With Care offering a quick and accurate service from the base of a pack delivering plenty of quality ball, and Malone, who has not always been viewed as the most fluent and astute distributor, pulling some decent strings from fly-half, Quins continued to play with verve and ambition. And they were further rewarded when Mike Brown found Guest with an exquisitely judged cut-out pass. A scoreline of 20-3 was no less than Quins deserved.Still, a Hewat penalty on the hour mark reduced the defict to 20-11, whereupon two Irish tries in the following seven minutes put the visiting side not only stunned Quins, but put the visiting side into a 25-20 lead.</p> <p>If the first was a slick handling move finished off by Delon Armitage, then the second was a case of Quins shooting themselves in the foot. And poor Chris Robshaw was the culprit, as his pass just inside the Exiles half was picked off by Hewat and returned with interest. A further Hewat penalty threatened to leave Quins with nothing to show for their efforts until the riveting denouement.</p> <p><strong>HARLEQUINS </strong>Brown; Strettle, Tiesi, Turner-Hall, Monye (Williams 77), Malone (Luveniyali 76) , Care; Jones, Botha (Fuga 69), Ross (Lambert 76), Kohn (Robson 69), Evans, Easter (Robshaw 50), Skinner (capt), Guest</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Monye, Guest, Care <strong>Cons</strong> Malone 2, Luveniyali<br><strong>Pens</strong> Malone 2</p> <p><strong>LONDON IRISH </strong>Hewat; Ojo, D Armitage, Mapusua (capt), Tagicakibau, Hickey (Seviali'i 46), Richards (Hodgson 53); Corbisiero, Paice (Coetzee 58), Rautenbach (Lea'aetoa 58), Kennedy, Johnson (Casey 46), Thorpe, S Armitage, Hala'Ufia.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> D Armitage 2, Hewat 2 <strong>Cons</strong> Hewat 3<br><strong>Pens</strong> Hewat 3</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>Dean Richard</p>",
  "<p>Who would have thought the Premier League's first Brazilian boss would relish an encounter like this? Long-ball, body-bruising Stoke City the weekend before a Champions League away trip should be a recipe for calamity, yet Luiz Felipe Scolari saw it as a joyful challenge to his old Gaucho scrapper's spirit.</p> <p>As he had been in his days as a brutal stopper on the rough pitches of Rio Grande do Sul, Scolari had his squad steeled for the battle. As he'd guided his Brazil and Portugal teams through tournaments, he ensured Chelsea's skills were not forgotten in the physicality.</p> <p>A goal in either half returned them - at least temporarily - to the summit of the Premier League where they should not be far from when Scolari's first English season comes to its conclusion.</p> <p>'Sometimes it's impossible to play beautiful football,' he said. 'We need to construct first, win the game. Sometimes we try to play and the other team tries only to play with your mistakes. It's not easy but today my team played with a good position on the pitch and for me that's beautiful.I know my team, they play as I want. For me they play fantastic football because I am coach and I don't see it the same as fans.'</p> <p>There had been civility in Stoke's teamsheet. Rory Delap, and the 'incredible' long throws that Scolari spent three days preparing a solution for, was absent after a hamstring strain. A raucous home support was less welcoming, roaring lusty delight as Stoke barrelled into Chelsea from kick-off.</p> <p>Deco, Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Essien short of their own best eleven, Chelsea's intention was to set the tone with as positive an opening as possible. Frank Lampard's craftily chipped pass to Didier Drogba came close to delivering one, only for Thomas Sorensen to parry the forward's finish.</p> <p>Chelsea's opening goal was a thing of beauty, started and emphatically completed by Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa. Taking possession 10 yards inside Stoke's half, the Portugal right back laid the ball off to Salomon Kalou then sprinted into the box to reclaim it from Lampard. Finally, came a vicious shot, propelled abreast of goalkeeper and off Andy Griffin's chest.</p> <p>Though John Terry resorted to the rugby-tackle defending that landed him in trouble at Manchester City, Chelsea's area did not come under threat until the second half. By then Chelsea's lead might have doubled as Lampard's shot deflected a foot wide and Sorensen strong-armed a raking Florent Malouda drive on to the crossbar.</p> <p>Malouda signalled a Chelsea lapse in petulantly standing over a Stoke free-kick at the cost of a shove in the chest from Griffin and a mutual yellow card. Some loose passing allowed the home team sufficient dead balls to frighten, particularly when Leon Cort drew John Obi Mikel into a goalline clearance.</p> <p>Chelsea, however, had a salve for touchline concerns. Bosingwa attacked Stoke's left flank before crossing toward the penalty spot. Though Cort read the centre, he could not control it, leaving Nicolas Anelka with a chance even the profligate Frenchman could not miss. 'That killed it for us,' said Tony Pulis. 'But we've played well in some difficult games. We must not get down in the dumps.'</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Nick Dunn, StokeCity.rivals.net forum</strong></p> <p>This match came straight after the Liverpool game and we weren't expecting points from either, so we were already ahead. It's always hard to concede an own goal, which it was in my view, early on. But we made Chelsea work for the victory. Delap being out injured cut off one of our avenues of attack, which wasn't helpful. We were spirited, but it's always a concern when one of their players costs more than our entire squad! In the second half we were way more spirited and had a few decent chances. We conceded a second, but our players didn't let their heads go down and we avoided any 5-0 or so scoreline.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Sorensen 8; Griffin 7, Cort 6, Ab Faye 8, Higginbotham 8; Lawrence 7, Tonge 7, Diao 7, Olofinjana 6, Cresswell 6; Sidibe 7, Kitson 6 Fuller 8</p> <p><strong>Trizia Fiorellino, Chair, Chelsea Supporters Group</strong></p> <p>Stoke harried us really well. We lacked creativity without Joe Cole and Deco, so struggled to get the ball to Drogba, who had go out to get it himself. Still, it was the kind of workmanlike performance that teams need to put on every now and again, and we did very well considering our absentees. Scolari changed it around in the second half - Anelka came on and we started holding the ball up better. Stoke went after us with a bit more bite and they should've had a goal. However, class showed in the end.

  "<p>Alistair Cooke, a very shrewd film critic, once wrote of 'stage acting as a form of sculpture and film acting as a performance with the face only - the best film actors do best with the eyes only'. He was writing about Edward G Robinson, Henry Fonda, Jean Gabin and Spencer Tracy. But Paul Newman, who has died at his home in Connecticut aged 83, belongs in that illustrious company. </p> <p>Although a number of his finest pictures were in black and white (The Hustler, for example, perhaps his best film), what comes most immediately to mind when we think of him are those deep blue eyes that variously sparkle, interrogate, exude a deep pain and sadness - the sadness of innocent inexperience in such earlier roles as the troubled boxer Ricky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) and the doomed Billy the Kid in The Left Handed Gun (1958); the sadness of a lifetime's experience in later character parts such as the retired private eye in Twilight, the elderly gang boss in Road to Perdition and the recidivist crook pulling his last heist in Where the Money Is. He once said: 'I picture my epitaph: \"Here lies Paul Newman who died a failure because his eyes turned brown.\"'</p> <p>Like his contemporary, Marlon Brando, in whose formidable shadow he initially worked, and James Dean, six years his junior, he was a product of New York Actors' Studio. But while sinking deep into his characters, he was able to transcend the Method and encompass a variety of styles, roles, social classes and genres. He started out under classical Hollywood studio directors such as Robert Rossen, Robert Wise and Otto Preminger, developed close relations with relative newcomers such as Martin Ritt, Robert Altman and George Roy Hill (who directed him in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting and Slap Shot) and in his later years put himself at the service of newcomers Martin Scorsese (The Color of Money for which he won his only Oscar), the Coen Brothers (The Hudsucker Proxy) and Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition</p> <p>After a disastrous debut, muttering in Brandoesque fashion in deplorable religious epic The Silver Chalice (1954), he took on a wide range of parts in small, ambitious projects, conventional genre movies, comedies and big budget pictures such as Exodus, in which he played an activist in the foundation of Israel, almost the only occasion on which he played a Jew (his father was Jewish, his mother a Catholic). Exodus is one of the few movies in which he didn't play an outsider or nonconformist.</p> <p>Unlike Brando, who never returned to the stage after going to Hollywood, Newman retained a lifetime interest in theatre, as did his wife, Joanne Woodward. He appeared in screen versions of Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth (in a part he'd created on Broadway) and Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, and directed Woodward in a version of Williams's The Glass Menagerie, which, unusually in Hollywood, retained all the original dialogue and didn't credit any adaptor. He also directed her in Rachel, Rachel (1968), an exquisite, delicately observed film about a lonely New England schoolteacher, which was nominated for a best picture Oscar. </p> <p>Only rarely were his performances self-regarding (monumentally so, working with a staggeringly drunk Lee Marvin in Pocket Money), or ingratiating. He earned our sympathy rather than demanding it in The Verdict, where he played a boozy ambulance-chasing lawyer redeeming himself. And he often played downright dislikeable characters - the corrupt modern cowboy in Hud, for instance, and the overbearing General Leslie R Groves, the military boss at Los Alamos in Roland Joff\u00e9's Shadow Makers (aka Fat Man and Little Boy in the United States), though neither was an outright villain. </p> <p>He did, however, have certain foibles. Motor racing was his great passion, and he produced and starred in Winning, a poor movie with the Indianapolis 500 as its background; two years ago he provided an appropriately gravelly voice to oldtimer Doc Hudson, an ancient but well-preserved vehicle in Pixar's animated movie Cars. After the success of Hud he developed a curious superstition about titles beginning with H. When invited to appear in a film of Ross Macdonald's The Moving Target, he insisted that Macdonald's private eye Lew Archer be renamed, and the film was released in America as Harper</p> <p>James Stewart once said that film actors give their audiences 'pieces of time'. While Newman's best pictures hang together as creative entities (there is a kind of perfection to The Hustler and to the western Hombre), as with other actors it is unforgettable moments and sequences that come to mind and revive memories of being moved to laughter, tears, reflection, self-examination. We recall the illiterate Billy the Kid learning to read in The Left Handed Gun (a film based on a TV play by his close friend and fellow liberal, Gore Vidal); the wounded pool player's tragic interlude with the crippled alcoholic (Piper Laurie) in The Hustler; the eponymous anarchic outsider in Cool Hand Luke engaging in an egg-eating contest with his fellow prisoners on a southern chain-gang; Newman and Redford pausing on the cliff, a posse breathing down their necks, in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the freeze frame of them running out to confront the Bolivian police in the same picture; Newman and Redford shaking down Robert Shaw on the train from New York to Chicago in The Sting, that necklace of cinematic pearls; his heartbreaking scene with the treacherous old friend played by James Garner in Robert Benton's undervalued elegiac thriller Twilight</p> <p>Yet while remembering these and other scenes, we also think of Newman as a man of great decency and dedication, both on and off screen, a humanitarian and philanthropist, who took his responsibilities as an artist and citizen seriously, but never solemnly. </p> <p>He was always ready to prick any bubble of conceit and pomposity. In this context we think of that exchange between Redford and Newman discussing their formidable opponents at the New York train station in The Sting. 'They're not as smart of they think they are,' says Redford. 'Neither are we,' Newman replies.</p>",
  "<p>Rothko: The Late Series is radiant with dark light, sonorous in its tonal effects, massively grand and superbly displayed according to the artist's own rules. It also shows Rothko at his most lugubrious, repetitive and flatly uninspired. The show is destined to be highly controversial.</p> <p>Everyone knows what we are supposed to feel before the transcendent beauty of a Rothko - amazement, awe and revelation. The artist, never prone to false modesty, cited all three and they became the prescribed response for a generation. From the early 1950s, when he found form with those shimmering oblongs of colour, writers soaked in the transcendental prose of the times spoke of his art in terms of Heidegger, Jung, Nietzsche, the Bible, whatever could be quoted in support of the artist's messianic belief in his paintings as spiritual expressions, manifestations of the sublime, touching the face of infinity.</p> <p>It is 20 years since we last had the opportunity to see Rothko's paintings here in any number and commentators were still talking in those terms. Given these exalted claims, and given that the late paintings are so dark and demanding, the question forces itself forward - will we still be struck dumb at Tate Modern? To judge by the disagreements at the press view, this is an all-out personality test.</p> <p>Rothko's late paintings, where the palette fades to black, used to be described as having the tragic grandeur of Aeschylus, a view bleakly confirmed when he slashed his wrists on a cold February morning in 1970. He had been working on a commission to paint murals for the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan, which he famously reneged upon later, and the late works took off from this series. He eventually produced 15 colossal rectangular paintings that are reunited here for the first time since they left his studio, along with many smaller associated works. </p> <p>There are no shattering compositional changes. Rothko's mature art always took the form of variations on a rectangular theme: arrays of oblongs and bands in glowing colours that blend and merge, foreground and background in constant oscillation. It was a strong idea and he certainly made it perform over and again. The late works rely considerably more on tone than colour - no more sun-up and sun-down saturations, fields of gold or Northern Lights - but this has the effect of removing some of the more obvious figurative associations.</p> <p>Or so it seems at first. Surrounded by black, brown and grey, with the occasional fiery orange against blackish maroon, the first sensations are of slow thrumming and heavy glowering at best; drabness and deadening inertia at worst. The immediate optical attraction is towards anything that moves, or appears to move, but alas this deselects more than half of the show.</p> <p>But among the more dynamic works, blue-black arrives out of a brown-black like the first hint of dawn. Silver-grey settles on maroon like hoar frost, or the bloom on a plum. Maroon furls silver-grey like the breath on a mirror. A reddish-black shore emerges from a dark-grey sea. The eye takes in the effect; the mind seeks analogies. In no time, you are making pictures yourself. </p> <p>It is a primitive instinct and not to be despised. Rothko was less insistent on the abstract qualities of his art than one might imagine. Six works on paper, effectively gigantic watercolours each divided by a horizon line, inevitably form a sequence of landscapes. The Moon's surface, furrowed fields by night, a storm over a prairie, the presentiment of an image is abetted by the choice of colour: grey over earthy brown.</p> <p>But Rothko steers the big works straight towards imagery, introducing all sorts of elements that can only be described as figurative: pillars, arches, windows, apertures, gateways. They are spectral, of course - more like ghostly after-images - but it still feels like the most naked contrivance. Want to get out of yourself, perceive the mysteries of infinity? Look through this window into the voluminous emptiness yonder.</p> <p>At their best, the late paintings can give a pure optical hit. There is a black on black work where the graduations of tone are so subtle that the eye, adjusting to the darkness, sees it deepen and fade inexplicably. But that painting, No 1, is scaled to the proportions of the human body, like the best of the earlier work. The bigger Rothko gets - and some of the murals are as big as billboards and pitched as high on the wall - the more diluted their strength.</p> <p>People often speak of the turbulent emotion of the late works, associating their darkness with Rothko's future suicide. But how can they possibly tell? Whatever emotion the paintings may have absorbed from his anguished inner life is subsumed in their gloomy permutations, one after another, narrow to wide, darker to lighter, vivid to blunt, just going through the weary motions.</p> <p>Strength sapped, inspiration drained: that is the feeling that comes off the walls. Even in the paint itself, the cracks are beginning to show. Rothko drives on and on, prolific to the end, but compared to the riches of the previous decade, when the paintings could still sing, the interpenetration of colours remained mysterious, the stained and glazed and scumbled surfaces could still entrance the eye, these works are dispiritingly ordinary.</p> <p>Rothko was all against a purely aesthetic response to his work - 'Only that subject matter is valid which is tragic and timeless,' was his ex cathedra statement - but in the late works it is surely inevitable. For if one is not to find numinous depth there, then colour and form are precisely what one is forced back upon. </p> <p>I don't doubt the sincerity of those who claim to feel cleansed or transfixed, but I do wonder that they require so little from Rothko by his own high standards. Nearly all of the Abstract Expressionists developed a trademark look - apocalyptic, radically reductive, transcendent - that was repeated so often that the corporate foyer eventually beckoned. So it was with Rothko. The works in this show, whatever they tell of the man, speak of just such exhaustion.</p>",
  "<p>David Haye loves this place, the enchanting little port of Kyrenia in Northern Cyprus. As he pounds the emptied roads, coaxing his lungs to pump more and more oxygen around his amazing body, warm, slow winds rustle the olive trees and the fighter's taut skin glistens in the sun.</p> <p>'Fantastic place,' he says. 'Fantastic.' </p> <p>The presence of a gregarious, life-loving fighter from south London in such a tranquil setting may seem incongruous. But it is Haye's haven from the noise of professional boxing. This is where, at 27, he has chosen to launch the closing stage of his interesting career.</p> <p>In the shade of the Benedictine monastery of Bellapaix, or 'beautiful peace', artists sketch the lovely bay below. Twenty-five miles away, United Nations soldiers patrol the Green Line, which went up in 1964 , after the Turks and Greeks on the island concluded they no longer could abide each other and would use guns and life-long hatred to prove it. Most of the 2.3 million tourists who come to Cyprus each year head for the fun and sun of the south.They leave Kyrenia to the locals. The north is lovely, but a little abandoned. There is a melancholic air about the place.</p> <p>Why here, then? 'Lovely people,' Haye says. 'It's a bit quiet, but it suits me. I can chill out. I can get on with my training. I get ready here for what is waiting for me over there.'</p> <p>Five hours' flying time from London and the boisterous Bermondsey streets where he grew up, Haye goes to work in monk-like solitude. The only hubbub in the gym he has just built behind a backstreet foundry comes from the usual sources: gabby boxers, oomphed heavy bags, the clank of barbells. The locals come every day to watch their new neighbour, curious and bewitched.</p> <p>Haye is, in a way, an accidental tourist. Northern Cyprus chose him, or rather his trainer and manager, Adam Booth, who is married to a local girl, picked it out for him: a rented house so far, a specially built one soon, when the expected earnings from his heavyweight career grow.</p> <p>The next part of their adventure \u2013 which started a decade ago when they trained at the Fitzroy Lodge Amateur Boxing Club in Lambeth \u2013 gets serious on 15 November at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, when Haye will fight at heavyweight, against a yet-to-be-named opponent, Haye has already relinquished the world cruiserweight title he won by stopping the Frenchman Jean-Marc Mormeck in Paris last November, and defended with crushing finality in the second round against Welshman Enzo Maccarinelli in March.</p> <p>Haye, who wears his fighting nickname, The Hayemaker, with the swagger of a gunslinger, has knocked out 17 others. Ismail Abdoul lasted the distance in July 2006, but aside from him Haye has knocked out all his opponents bar old, tough Carl Thompson, who knocked Haye out in his 11th pro contest, four years ago. That was always going to be a dangerous engagement, against the fighter who ended Chris Eubank's career. But Haye loves risk. It gives him the buzz he needs to perform at his best. It also makes him great box-office, a big puncher with a suspect chin who is not afraid to put that frailty on the line. There are not many like him in boxing, a business in which prospects are more often than not protected by careful match-making until they have been groomed for the big sell of a world-title fight.</p> <p>The words 'knock' and 'out' recur more than any others in Haye's conversation. He is almost obsessed with levelling his opponents. He has been described as a suicide boxer, a short-term bomb, a shooting star. He is all of these. Which is why important people in the business are drooling over the prospect of his making an impact at heavyweight, where glamour is in short supply.</p> <p>Carl King promoted his fight against Mormeck in Paris, where he got up from the canvas to record a seventh-round stoppage. I spoke to King the next day and he was still raving about Haye, so much so he started to sound like his step-father, Don. 'He is special. He is just what boxing needs. He is what the heavyweight division needs, and I will tell you why. This young man can knock them out with either hand \u2013 and he can be knocked out. That is a recipe for drama. And boxing is all about drama. Also, he is intelligent, talks well, is good looking. Women love him. Men admire him. He sells tickets. What more do you want?'</p> <p>Where Haye is like other ambitious fighters is in his towering self-belief. He will be world heavy weight champion. He will knock out the main claimant to that honour, the unnaturally large but brittle Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko \u2013 'violently', as he put it recently. He will then knock out Wladimir's tougher older brother, Vitali \u2013 and anyone else who wants to step up. There is fire in his eyes when he fights, but he evinces quiet, articulate certainty away from the ring. He will conquer, he will rule for three years and he will walk away. The campaign starts here, in Kyrenia, now.</p> <p>It has not always been this way. I have known Haye since he was an amateur. His career was nearly over before it got going: in 1999 at the York Hall in London's East End, the light-punching Jim Twite put his lights out with a single punch. I remind him how despondent he was when we spoke later that night. He laughs. 'I don't remember that.' Well, you have good reason not to, I say.</p> <p>This was a testing time for the young boxer \u2013 and Booth. There was not enough room for the pair of them and David's grizzled, wise, old school trainer, Mick Carney, in the Fitzroy Lodge gym. Carney reckons he was the laziest and most brilliant boxer he has ever seen.</p> <p>'I was down there doing padwork,' Booth says, 'with guys like Chris Okoh, Patrick Mullings. David was 17. Started doing pads with him, talking, more pad work. It grew from there. You'd have to be blind not to see how special he was. People were saying it from when he was 15. You could see his strengths \u2013 and his weaknesses. He was lazy, no doubt about that. It was all too easy for him. </p> <p>'I said to him four days before the Jim Twite fight, \"You keep behaving like this, you're going to wake up the next morning and say, 'What the hell have I done?'\" That's exactly what happened.'</p> <p>Haye agrees. 'It was the first time I'd ever been put down. I'd never really been hurt in a boxing ring. I was 18 years old and I thought that my shit didn't stink. I thought I could go out there and do whatever I wanted to do \u2013 even when I was down. I remember I got up about eight and thinking, \"How'd the referee get to eight so quick?\" The referee was looking into my eyes and I thought, \"Who does he think he is?\" He was waving it off and I said, \"Don't embarrass me like that, man! I'm going to knock him out, you idiot.\" But it was a lesson for me. I wasn't dedicating myself like I should have done. It was one of the lowest points of my life, but it made me the man I am today.'</p> <p>What he overlooks \u2013 or maybe chooses to forget \u2013 is it took his father, Darren, an accomplished martial artist and no-nonsense cab-driver who<br>worked the streets of Catford, to talk him out of his utter desolation. Haye, always a star, now vulnerable and exposed, wanted to leave the venue by the back door. Mr Haye said: 'No, go out there in front of your friends and be a man.' He did.</p> <p>When Haye and Booth left for the Broad Street gym in London's East End, the radicalisation of his boxing began. 'Talented individuals in sporting history have a background of complacency,' Booth says. 'They don't have to strive. The way we deal with that with David is constantly putting stress in front of him, the type of opponent, the type of fight \u2013 which is why, after 22 fights, he unified the world title.'</p> <p>After the Twite knockout, Haye's boxing education reached university standard. The easy days were over. Later that year, the American Michael Simms put him out in the early rounds of the world championships in Houston, Texas, but Haye won silver at the next championships in Belfast two years later. His early paid fights followed a familiar pattern, veterans and selected opponents falling before him with pleasing regularity. Carl Thompson interrupted that progress and the doubters pounced. Haye was too flashy, they said, boxing with his hands by his side and his head in the clouds. But they did not see the growing determination and stubbornness under<br>the smile, nor the subtlety in his method.</p> <p>Promoters used to getting their own way were also frustrated with Haye, who turned down their off ers and put his total trust in the inexperienced Booth. The performance that lit a spark for Haye was his knockout of Maccarinelli. Oscar De La Hoya, the multi-titled Golden Boy, was among the many influential deal-makers impressed by his style and charisma. Haye, hands low, eyes alive, heart pounding in front of a sellout crowd, stalked the Welshman, whose nerves were equally on edge. In the second round, Haye exploded one brain-numbing headshot after another on Maccarinelli, who crumpled in the corner. It was a chilling display of raw power. </p> <p>Haye, De La Hoya now said, would 'take the heavyweight division by storm' and 'give this once glorious division a much needed facelift'. Haye would 'give fight fans around the world fights to look forward to, just like the great Muhammad Ali once did'. Evander Holyfield, too, still hanging on in the game, joined the chorus, perhaps hoping for a shootout of his own. He was at ringside in Greenwich and, even though he had not heard of Haye just a week earlier, he declared himself a fan.</p> <p>The optimism will die if Haye's trigger-quick left hook lets him down, if his chin falls apart, if the inner selfishness he conquered after a wild party time youth kicks in again. But there is no sign of this \u2013 and for that he has Booth to thank. There is something about Booth that sets him apart from nearly every other handler I have met in boxing. He wears a knowing half-smile, as if he is aware of things others can not see or understand, and he talks with a measured tone that does not invite a challenge. You can imagine Haye believing every word he says. To date, he is justified in that faith. </p> <p>'Adam talks to everybody,' Haye says, 'he's constantly looking for the best training methods. Some coaches have got too much of an ego to do that. That's what I like about him. But how he would train me is completely different to how he would train someone else. He sees the best that you've got and he works on it.'</p> <p>'Simply,' Booth says, 'he loves to get in the ring, in front of loads of people, and trade shots. I would say that's probably true of only 5 per cent of boxers. A lot of boxers actually don't enjoy what goes on. Sugar Ray Leonard admitted that the actual fighting, he hated it, because there was too much at stake. But David's got a really healthy outlook on life. He's very relaxed, always looking for where he can have a laugh. But when he's in the ring, he's scary.'</p> <p>Haye, like most big men, hated the grind of the floor work and the boredom of running to build stamina. He still does, to an extent. But he steels himself now, under Booth's persuasive guidance. He has grown up, a little late, and he appreciates the merits of sacrifice. Now, his preparation is scientific, rigid and punishing.</p> <p>All of this may have something to do with fatherhood. After years of helping himself to the pleasures of London nightlife, which a man so handsome (he has been a model for Versace and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in his 'cleaner-cut years') can hardly avoid, Haye has settled down with wife and child, a son named Cassius. But his private life is seriously off limits, is where the affability stops. His love of privacy, so at odds with his outgoing personality, is one reason he loves Cyprus. Promoters and managers who do not have a piece of him argue that you can't make it on your own. Audley Harrison, who won Olympic gold then saw his reputation tarnished over time, is testimony to that. Haye is not sure.</p> <p>'People say, \"This is the way it is, it's a scumbag business, everyone rips you off.\" Well, actually, it doesn't have to be like that, though. If you're in control, how difficult is the job? So I've made sure that at no stage of my career have I been vulnerable. If Audley had knocked everybody out and looked great and won a world title, he would have been a genius.'</p> <p>Haye and Booth are not complete loners. They have done a partnership deal with De La Hoya to promote fighters from their stable. There are a dozen British boxers with them in Cyprus. Some are on the way up, such as David Barnes, some hanging in there, like Ryan Rhodes. Haye knows about fight budgets, where you can place certain fighters, where you can't. 'I haven't wasted my time with fighters I'm odds-on to beat. The networks, the Americans, the casinos, they're not interested in that. They love my high-risk strategy. I put it on the line \u2013 like nobody else in boxing does.'</p> <p>He has a magpie mind, swooping on detail, from small to large. Most boxers are compliant, handing responsibility to managers and promoters. Haye is buzzing for information, his laptop popping open for regular checks of fight websites. He has made it his business \u2013 because it is exactly that \u2013 to know the enemy better than the enemy know him. Is there anyone out there like him?</p> <p>'I haven't seen anyone, to be honest, nobody who sticks in my mind.' It is steamingly hot outside. Inside his gym, Haye winds up his workout, looking good at 16st 2\u00bdlb, with a bit to shave off yet, one or two muscles to firm up and then back to business for his November fight. 'There's a few doubters out there still,' he says, 'who don't think I can make it at heavyweight. They were the same doubters who didn't think I could beat Mormeck or Maccarinelli. And what happened? I knocked 'em out.' </p> <p>Haye, born to fight, born to knock people out, finds peace in a land that is quiet on the outside and raging within. Maybe it is the perfect place for him, after all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kevin Mitchell is the Observer's chief sports writer</p>",
  "<h2>Leo Hickman - NO</h2> <p>When you jump off that chair lift for the first time every season, fill your lungs with frigid air and glance at that mountain vista ahead, it's hard not to feel a connection with nature. Immersing yourself in this environment is arguably one of skiing's key attractions. </p> <p>But strip away the glamour and the thrills and you are left with a list of environmental woes. And that's not taking into account the fact that the busiest slope in any ski region is the line of aircraft descending to the airport. You cannot talk about skiing without mentioning climate change. Skiers, of all people, should be aware of the rapid changes occurring on the world's mountain ranges. Glaciers are in speedy retreat and snow lines are rising quickly. </p> <p>Skiers are not directly causing these problems, other than by being members of the human race. But the skiing industry is frantically, forlornly, trying to stave off the deleterious effects of climate change with a series of measures that will only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The arrival of snow cannons at virtually every major resort over the past decade is the most worrying of trends. Working through the night as the skiers' attention turns to the delights of schnapps and fondue, these spray particles of water mixed with nucleating agents into the freezing air to create a blanket of artificial snow. A lack of the real stuff has forced the industry to rely on these machines, but their environmental impact is considerable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mountainwilderness.fr/\">Mountain Wilderness</a>, a French conservation group that described skiing as \"the cancer of the Alps\", says that 4,000 cubic metres of water are needed to cover one hectare of piste for a season \u2013 whereas a hectare of corn needs only 1,700. Across the Alps, it is estimated that artificial snow consumes the same amount of water each year as 1.5 million people. Incredibly, in some regions, tap water is used, but elsewhere river water is extracted from the valleys below and pumped back up the mountain. </p> <p>This causes two problems. First, there is the energy expenditure: Mountain Wilderness says that it requires about 25,000 kilowatt-hours, costing about \u20ac150,000, to cover just one hectare of piste with snow for a season (that's largely why the cost of ski passes has risen so much in recent years). Second, dumping river water at high altitude disrupts biodiversity because it introduces nutrients in the water into an area where they wouldn't otherwise be. </p> <p>Using artificial snow also means that the pistes now take up to a month longer than normal to melt in the summer, preventing many plant species lying dormant underneath from germinating and flowering, leading to huge muddy scars in the summer meadows where the pistes once lay. Just take a look on Google Earth at satellite images of, say, the <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/4hp36z\">Chamonix valley</a> or Aspen during the summer months.</p> <p>\"Artificial snow is not the root of all evil, but it is very close,\" says Sergio Savoia, the programme director of WWF Switzerland. \"One of the biggest problems is psychological: snow cannons give tourists the idea that it is business as usual. But we don't actually have much snow.\"</p> <p>Some low-lying resorts are experiencing winter nights that are too warm even to use snow cannons. There are reports that helicopters are being used to ferry snow to threadbare pistes in order to keep these resorts in business. In 2002, Italian police set up a task force to investigate the \"theft\" of snow from glaciers by the truck load in order to serve nearby resorts. The alternative is to abandon such resorts and chase the snow, by building new lifts and hotels further up the mountain. This is already being seen in some places. </p> <p>But, despite the promises of resort owners, how environmentally sensitive can a concrete mixer really be when taken high up into a wilderness area and put to work?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leo Hickman is the author of The Final Call: Investigating Who Really Pays for Our Holidays (Transworld)</p> <h2>Veronica Tonge - YES</h2> <p>Many people take the view that the downhill ski industry ruins the environment, consumes vast amounts of energy and cannot possibly be in harmony with the principles of responsible or sustainable tourism. However, it has been the saviour of many mountain communities and traditions, halting the depopulation and poverty that occurred at the end of the 19th century.<br> It requires positive action, however, for a sport such as skiing, with its requirement for lifts, pistes and artificial snow, to operate on a green basis. Ski lifts and artificial snow-making do require power for the ski season; but they are increasingly efficient and clean since they no longer run on diesel and the electricity can come from renewable sources. Many resorts in Europe derive nearly all their power from hydroelectricity and, in America, Vail Resorts became one of the world's largest corporate users of renewable energy when it switched its five resorts and offices to use wind power. Lech in Austria has reduced its CO2 emissions further and improved air quality by building a biomass plant to provide heat and hot water to the resort and by providing a free public bus service to remove the need for cars. Therefore, staying for a week there could result in negligible emissions. </p> <p>So what about the chemicals in the artificial snow and the vast quantities of water it requires? Resorts have used proteins to help the artificial snow freeze at higher temperatures; however, studies have been inconclusive on the impacts. Nonetheless, some resorts have never used them, such as those in the Austrian Tyrol where the artificial snow is made from pure water \u2013 evidenced by the certified organic pastures underneath. The water is either taken from rivers or reservoirs built to store rainwater up the mountain. In Austria, the reservoirs have to undergo environmental impact assessments before construction and often end up blending so harmoniously that summer walks are routed to them. The rivers are assessed to work out the exact amount of water that can be safely taken out without damage to the wildlife and this water is even filtered to ensure that it is pure. </p> <p>And what about the delayed snowmelt? We have all seen mountains where the only snow remaining is that of the piste of artificial snow. Repeated scientific studies have found no negative impacts of artificial snow or delayed snowmelt on vegetation and, in the same way a plastic bag protects your favourite garden plants from spring frosts, artificial snow has been found to operate in the same way for the Alpine vegetation.</p> <p>Pistes are the other requirement for skiing. Although some have been created by bulldozing the mountain, there is a new technique called the 'soil push' method, whereby the topsoil and vegetation is removed as \"turf\", the land is machine-graded underneath and then the topsoil is re-laid, which effectively keeps all the plant and insect diversity intact as before. Some resorts are reducing the need for prepared pistes altogether by reclassifying advanced runs as \"itinerary\" routes which are not prepared or groomed, providing exciting challenges for experienced skiers.</p> <p>So can you ski and keep your green conscience clear? Yes, but only if you select your resort carefully. Check websites such as the <a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">Ski Club of Great Britain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.saveoursnow.com\">Save our Snow</a> for lists of resorts that are taking positive environmental steps, but do your own research, too, by checking out the resort's own websites. They are increasingly realising that green credentials can win them more visitors. Choose the right resort and your conscience can be as clear as the mountain air.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Veronica Tonge is the author of several reports analysing the impacts of skiing</p>",
  "<p>The last time West Bromwich Albion ventured to the north east they were on the wrong end of a 3-1 humbling at the hands of Hartlepool, a result that had the doom mongers predicting a slow and painful death for Tony Mowbray's side this season. Four weeks on from the Hartlepool debacle and Albion showed they have rediscovered their mettle with a gutsy victory over Middlesbrough, previously undefeated at home and in a place where they had not won for 56 years. Jonas Olsson put the boing back into the Baggies' step, scoring the only goal of the game in the 53rd minute to make it a happy Teesside return for former Middlesbrough stalwart Mowbray.</p> <p>'I said beforehand that this was another game where we had an opportunity to get three points and we've gone and done that,' said Albion's manager, tipped two years ago by many as a candidate to succeed Steve McClaren as manager at the Riverside.</p> <p>'Not too many sides will come here and get a win. They were unbeaten [at home] so we knew we would have a job on our hands. Yes, we had to defend for long periods in the second half, but we did that well. I felt we could have won by a goal or two more in the end.'</p> <p>It used to be the case that Middlesbrough, the most Jekyll and Hyde of outfits, always seemed to take points off the better clubs while conspiring to fail miserably against the strugglers. During the early stages of this season, however, Gareth Southgate's side seem to have changed tact. At home they have tended to outplay teams and win. Away they have still outplayed teams, only to lose. 'Now is the time to make our home form count,' wrote the manager in his programme notes, mindful of the negative effect three consecutive defeats on the road might have.</p> <p>Perversely, Boro chose to put in by far their most disjointed performance of the season at the Riverside. Although Afonso Alves was denied by the crossbar in the first half the home side only really came alive once they had fallen behind. When Ross Turnbull failed to get a decent punch on Jonathan Greening's corner Ishmael Miller was on hand to turn the ball back into the six-yard box where Olsson converted despite the attentions of two Middlesbrough defenders on the line.</p> <p>Middlesbrough were let down too often by misplaced passes and wayward shooting, as acknowledged by Southgate. 'We had more than enough chances to win the game, let alone draw it. In fact they could have buried us on the break and made it even more embarrassing. We're going to have to learn quickly.'</p> <p>The reason Albion did not make it more embarrassing? Step forward substitute Miller, who blew three late breaks by choosing to go for glory himself rather than squaring the ball for better placed team-mates. Fortunately for the visitors his selfishness ultimately proved uncostly.<br><strong><br>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Duncan Barrigan, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>I'm almost speechless after that. It's almost unbelievable to come away with nothing at all, but it was our own fault. Their keeper was great but we should have had at least one in the net - there were balls flying all over in the end. I think we lacked leadership at some stages. With10 minutes left we needed someone to step up and take charge, say Huth or Wheater, but it didn't happen, but maybe they don't have that leadership quality. I think Downing was captain but he didn't step up. We had a great save from Turnbull at the end. They made a good go of it, but I really think a draw would've been approaching fair. Their goal was a bit scrappy, the result of a terrible clearance. For us Morrison and Alves had great shots saved. That there weren't a lot more goals was the result of a combination of shots missed and good saves on both sides.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Turnbull 7; Hoyte 6, Huth 6, Wheater 7, Taylor; Aliadi\u00e8re 6 (Johnson 7), O'Neil 6, Shawky 5 (Digard 7), Downing 6; Mido 6, Alves 6<br><strong><br>Terry Wills, Baggies@yahoogroups.com</strong></p> <p>Our first win at the Riverside in who knows how long, but it was heart-attack Albion yet again. There were incidents at both ends. Middlesbrough had one purple patch along the way where they could have scored a number of times but I have to say that Carson played magnificently and made some great saves to stop them. It was our own fault that we didn't score more - Ishmael had three clear chances near the end and didn't convert. Our defence was quite solid, and new boy Donk had a very good game, looking very reliable. It could really have been four goals each with the number of openings.

The Democratic candidate had been under pressure to reassure voters with doubts about whether he has the judgment to be commander-in-chief. </p> <p>The forthcoming two debates will focus on the economy, on which Obama is seen to have a slight edge, and his campaign went on the offensive yesterday to try to exploit this. David Plouffe, his campaign manager, told reporters yesterday that Obama had passed the commander-in-chief threshold. 'Last night, we not only passed it, we flew by it.' </p> <p>But the McCain camp was unwilling to concede. 'Obama was on the defensive the whole time,' said Charles Black, a senior adviser. 'McCain was able to show experience and judgment and knowledge on all the issues.'</p> <p>Obama was due to hold rallies in North Carolina and Virginia, which traditionally vote Republican in presidential elections. His campaign also released a new television advertisement, chiding McCain for failing to say the words 'middle class' in the debate. </p> <p>McCain was due to head from Oxford, Mississippi, to Washington to rejoin negotiations on the financial crisis. </p> <p>McCain's strategy for Friday night's encounter was to sow doubts about Obama's foreign policy experience and his judgment. He accused Obama of lacking foreign policy and national security credentials, repeatedly bringing up the word 'experience' to highlight his own decades-long involvement in the Senate. He portrayed Obama as unfit to be president, dismissing him as 'naive' and dangerous. 'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand,' McCain said in several variations. 'I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience.'</p> <p>But Obama did enough by just standing his ground, challenging McCain's record on the Iraq war and swapping jibes over how to deal with Iran. </p> <p>Instant polls awarded the widely anticipated debate at the University of Mississippi to Obama, but pundits were divided, with some giving the night to McCain. The Wall Street Journal called it a draw, while the New York Times leant towards Obama. </p> <p>The encounter did not live up to the expectations created by last week's drama, which saw McCain threatening to boycott the debate because of the $700bn Wall Street bail-out crisis. </p> <p>Indeed, economic turmoil dominated the first half of the debate. In a format in which style can be as decisive as substance, Obama offered short answers, maintained his cool and kept his eyes fixed on McCain when it was his opponent's turn to speak. </p> <p>At one point - when McCain accused him of being as stubborn as George W. Bush - Obama guffawed. </p> <p>The performance came as a relief to Obama's campaign, which stopped preparation for the debate to focus on the financial crisis. Obama's debate coach, Greg Craig, said that Obama had devoted two or three hours on Friday to cramming on the economy. 'He was totally confident on a wide range of issues,' said Craig. 'He owned that stage.' </p> <p>McCain avoided eye contact with Obama and barely bothered to hide his contempt, smirking and shooting off a number of snide comments. Although he has a reputation for having a good sense of humour, there was little sign of it.</p> <p>Obama's strategy was to link McCain to Bush, and cast the Republican candidate as a continuation of one of the most unpopular leaders in US history. He blamed eight years of the Bush administration for the financial crisis, and claimed McCain had backed Bush throughout most of that time. </p> <p>'It's been your president, whom you said you agreed with 90 per cent of the time, who supported this orgy of spending. You voted for almost all of his budgets. To stand here and say that after eight years you're going to lead on controlling spending and balancing our tax cuts for middle-class families,' Obama said. 'It's kind of hard to swallow.'</p> <p>McCain opted for a populist appeal, saying: 'Somehow, in Washington today - and, I am afraid, on Wall Street - greed is rewarded, and corruption - or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.' McCain, who has previously admitted he is uncomfortable on economic terrain, quickly shifted the discussion of the bail-out to government spending. He made the radical suggestion for a freeze on all government spending.</p> <p>Obama shot back that that would be like taking a hatchet to a problem that required a scalpel. </p> <p>But the debate began to warm up only when the two turned to the Iraq war, with McCain claiming credit for the reduction in violence produced by the 'surge', the 30,000 extra US troops sent to the country last year. </p> <p>Obama said that McCain behaved as if the war in Iraq had begun only last year - instead of in 2003. He went on to list a series of what he said were his opponent's misjudgments. </p> <p>'The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.' </p> <p>He applied the same argument to McCain's judgments on Afghanistan and the war on terror, accusing him of consistently under-estimating the dangers. </p> <p>'While you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan. You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden. You don't muddle through in stamping out the Taliban.'</p> <p>McCain unsettled Obama when he claimed that US military leaders suggested Obama's plan to pull all US troops out of Iraq by the middle of 2010 was dangerous. Obama interrupted several times, saying that this was not the case. </p> <p>He also attacked Obama's plan to negotiate with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on the country's alleged nuclear weapons programme, without preconditions. </p> <p>'So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad and he says, \"We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the earth\" and we say, \"No, you're not\". Oh please,' McCain said.</p> <h2>Instant poll reaction</h2> <p>Instant polls, taken before the spin masters and TV commentators spoke, gave Barack Obama victory.</p> <p>A CBS poll of undecided voters found that 39 per cent thought the Democrat won, while 25 per cent gave the edge to McCain. Thirty-six per cent saw the contest as a draw. </p> <p>Insider Advantage polling also saw a virtual draw, with 42 per cent saying Obama won, and 41 per cent saying McCain did. </p> <p>In a CNN poll, 51 per cent of viewers thought Obama came out stronger from the encounter, while 38 per cent thought McCain delivered the better performance. However, the sample was weighted towards Democrats.</p>",
  "<p>'We are all,' said Keynes, 'the slaves of some defunct philosopher.' The question that will increasingly preoccupy mobile-phone executives from now on is which deceased sage is more appropriate for their product. Up to now, the relevant thinker has been Lenin - who, you may remember, was a control freak. Given that most mobile operators had their origins in traditional telephone companies - which liked to think they 'owned' their customers - this is hardly surprising. These outfits have control freakery in their corporate DNA.</p> <p>Last week, the first mobile phone based on Google's Android operating system was released by T-Mobile in the US. (The network is bringing it to the UK in November.) The philosophy underpinning the device is radically different from anything we have seen thus far in the mobile-phone market. The world is about to become a more interesting place. And what happens next could have far-reaching implications.</p> <p>To understand why, remember that mobile phones are essentially small computers with radios attached. Until comparatively recently, those computers were pretty feeble. But they were not immune from Moore's Law - which says that computing power doubles ever 18 months - so it was only a matter of time before someone put a computer capable of running a powerful operating system into consumers' hands.</p> <p>Apple was the first to bring it to market. The iPhone is essentially a handheld computer running an industrial-strength operating system - Unix. This transforms the phone from a specialised gadget into a platform capable of running just about anything that can be programmed. Anyone with the requisite skills can write stuff that will run on the iPhone. Its launch thus meant that a new software ecosystem - of developers writing applications for the iPhone - would evolve.</p> <p>Apple decided that, instead of just letting this happen, it would control it with Leninist rigour. Anyone could write programs for the iPhone, but only those approved by its manufacturer would make it into the apps branch of the iTunes store. The result has been an explosion of iPhone applications. The apps store supplied more than 60 million downloads in its first month, earning Apple $30m and developers $70m. </p> <p>So that's all right then? Not entirely. It turns out that there's a row brewing inside Apple's cosily walled garden. Some developers are beginning to resent what they see as the company's dictatorial attitude. Applications are rejected for reasons that are often reasonable (one displayed a knife and made unpleasant noises, for example), but are sometimes suspicious (eg, because they do a better job than the corresponding Apple application). As one commentator puts it: 'Trying to discern ahead of time [and of development expenditures] what Apple will or won't accept has become close to impossible, not only because Apple isn't talking about it, but also because it won't let anyone else talk about it. All apps store dealings with developers are covered by a non-disclosure agreement'</p> <p>Enter Google's Android phone. This is also a powerful handheld computer running an industrial-strength operating system, in this case, Linux. So, like the iPhone, it's a platform. People can - and will - write programs that will run on it and a vibrant new software ecosystem will evolve. But here the similarities between it and the iPhone end.</p> <p>For one thing, any manufacturer can make an Android phone, whereas only Apple is allowed to make the iPhone. But the most important difference is that the Android software ecosystem will not be an uncontrolled, open space. There will be no 'Android Store': anyone can write anything for the Google system, and they will. Stand by for an explosion of creativity.

  "<p>A terminally ill woman will this week launch a landmark legal battle to ensure that her husband is not prosecuted for helping her travel abroad to end her life. </p> <p>Debbie Purdy, 45, who suffers from primary progressive multiple sclerosis, is asking the Director of Public Prosecutions to clarify the law in England and Wales that makes it an offence to help someone commit suicide. Anyone who helps facilitate someone's suicide faces up to 14 years in prison, although prosecutors have been reluctant to press for the maximum penalty.</p> <p>On Thursday, the High Court will begin a two-day judicial review into Purdy's case. A verdict is expected a fortnight later. </p> <p>Purdy, who wants to have the option of travelling to a specialist euthanasia clinic in Switzerland, is worried that her husband, Omar, could face prosecution if he helped her.</p> <p>'It's a bit bizarre that, in Britain, suicide isn't illegal but assisting it is,' said Purdy, from Bradford. 'I am not asking to be able to carry out an illegal act in this country, just to have clarified what would happen to my husband if he accompanies me to somewhere where it is legal.'</p>",
  "<p>For a split second we are airborne as the boat speeds over a 2m wave and comes thumping down the other side. 'Whoa!' shouts one of my fellow passengers as the bow returns to the water and we land back in our seats. Peter, the young Norwegian skipper, is totally unfazed as he continues to steer our vessel towards Tafeltinden, our mountain destination for the day - one of many impressive peaks thrusting straight out of the sea on the other side of the fjord. This is already squaring up to be unlike any other skiing trip I have been on and we haven't even reached the slopes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338087764\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/29/Lyngen2.jpg\" alt=\"Powerboat from Lyngen Lodge, Norway\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Seven other thrill-seeking skiers and I had boarded the Spirit of Lyngen, a muscular 500-horse power vessel with the reassuring look of a RNLI lifeboat, at one of the tiny harbours that hug these far-north Norwegian shores. The snow-coated mountain backdrop and -5C temperatures made it feel slightly less incongruous to be walking down a pontoon in between brightly coloured fishing vessels and motorboats while carrying skis, poles, rucksacks and ski boots. </p> <p>Our \u00a3200,000 boat was acting as a high-speed water taxi service between our lodge on one side of the Lyngen fjord and the mountains that lay on the other side, on the Lyngen Peninsula. This 60-mile-long, 10-mile wide peninsula is home to Norway's most impressive mountain range, the Lyngen Alps. </p> <p>These Norwegian mountains have all the pointy peak perfection and jagged lines of their larger European cousins, without the scale. The highest peak, Jiekkevarre (1,880m), is less than half the height of the Alps' highest mountain, Mont Blanc (4,810m), and more common are peaks at 1,200m-1,500m. But what they lack in size they make up for with sheer grandeur, as many of these mountains rise directly out of the ocean, enabling you to ski literally all the way to sea level. Snow cover is consistently good thanks to a happy combination of Arctic air temperatures and the Gulf Stream. Northerly winds pick up moisture and are forced upward as they reach the Lyngen Alps where the water is dispensed as bounteous quantities of powder snow. </p> <p>All of this is possible at this relatively low altitude because of the area's extreme northerly location. The peninsula points due north from the very top of Norway, at the same latitude as Alaska and Siberia, and only 2,000km from the North Pole. Its unique location and impressive snow record is what attracted British mountain guide Graham Austick to the area where he set up his ski touring company Summit to Sea. He says: 'There is nowhere else in Europe where you can do this. You would have to go to deepest Alaska to get a similar experience and this is only a four-hour flight from the UK.' </p> <p>It feels very remote though, as we speed towards the peninsula in the Spirit of Lyngen on a perfect blue-sky day. We see one or two fishing boats during our 20-minute journey across the deep blue fjord waters and only a handful of buildings on this stretch of the peninsula's eastern coastline. The peninsula has a population of just 3,200. We drop anchor a short distance from the ribbon of rocky shoreline at Strupbreen bay, created by a receding glacier that only 100 years ago carved into the Lyngen fjord, and make our final leg of the journey by dinghy. </p> <p>'Skins on,' cries Graham once we are all ashore, referring to the strips of sticky material you attach to the bottom of your skis to enable the bases to grip when sliding them uphill. </p> <p>Well, you weren't expecting a chairlift were you? The Lyngen Alps are totally undeveloped and a protected area with the aim of maintaining the range's raw natural qualities for future generations. This includes not allowing any ski lifts or heliskiing operations, so the only way to reach a peak and access potentially awesome slopes of untouched powder is under your own steam.</p> <p>We set off up a steep, narrow slope on the Strupbreen glacier flanked by rocky walls, and traverse from side to side, leaving zig-zag tracks in our wake. The group soon slips into its natural pecking order from fittest and most able first, to the less fit or willing trailing at the back.</p> <p>Whether banker (there were three of them), builder, businessman or journalist, each of us quickly establishes our own rhythm, co-ordinating swinging arms, sliding skis and pole plants to create the strange sensation of climbing up a mountain on skis. It is -5C but our physical exertions and the stillness of the day make it feel much warmer. We end up toiling for about five hours to reach the 1,395m summit of Tafeltinden, including a three-hour stretch on a mostly flat section on top of the glacier. </p> <p>From the summit, we are presented with another jaw-dropping panorama: the unbroken sunshine turning the snow-clad mountains, which stretch as far as the eye can see in all directions, into blurs of brilliant whiteness. The scene is calmed and complemented by the deep-blue backdrop of the sea washing up against the numerous mountain shorelines. </p> <p>The icing on the cake - the descent - is as thrilling as the ascent has been physically challenging. Graham leads us to a 300m-long slope of untouched powder on a 40-degree pitch, which translates as 'scarily steep' for this particular skier. 'If you fall here, you won't stop until you reach the bottom,' says Graham reassuringly. He goes first and we follow one after another, carving big arcs, flying through the ankle-deep powder and savouring every moment of each hard-earned turn. Everyone makes it down without falling and has Cheshire-cat grins by the time they reach the bottom. The rest of the half-hour descent is gentler but no less spectacular as we follow the Koppangsbreen glacier to a small fishing port where skipper Peter is waiting to pick us up in the Spirit of Lyngen. </p> <p>Every day with Summit to Sea is a variation on this theme. Graham decides where to go depending on weather conditions on the day and chooses from well over 50 routes that he has painstakingly mapped out (the number is constantly increasing). On one occasion the boat takes us to an island and a classic, unbroken fall line descent of 1,142m all the way from peak to shoreline. Another day we are dropped at the bottom of a 38-degree slope where the wind is so strong it feels as if it could peel us off the mountain; the next to a spectacular ridge walk and then descent through untouched, knee-deep powder - so good that after a long day we hike up to do it again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338087765\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/29/Lyngen4.jpg\" alt=\"Lyngen Lodge, Norway\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At the end of each day we return by boat - sometimes stopping mid-journey for a spot of fishing - to our luxury accommodation, Lyngen Lodge, completed in March. The \u00a31m eight-bedroom lodge has a spacious feel with an open-plan dining and living room area. The theme is rustic with the lodge made from Scandinavian pine and the dining table from oak; the fireplace uses rocks from nearby beaches. There are pictures of wildlife on the walls and overlooking the guests is a stuffed muscox head. 'The idea is to bring nature inside,' says Graham's partner, Liz, who runs the lodge. </p> <p>The lodge has giant windows letting you gaze in awe at the mountains on the Lyngen Peninsula and check out some of the routes you skied, while munching on a perfectly baked slice of cake. Or you have a similar view while sitting in the lodge's outdoor hot tub. </p> <p>In the evenings Liz serves up top-quality food using produce from the local area - reindeer with pan-fried vegetables and turbot with sweet potato mash for example. The wine flows like the conversation as we chat over the day's events and what the following day has in store.</p> <p>And so to bed: happily knackered, superbly well fed and slightly quizzical as to whether that slight lack of balance is due to physical exhaustion, lack of sea legs or the extra can of Arctic beer ...</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Druce is editor of Daily Mail Ski &amp; Snowboard magazine</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Seven nights at Lyngen Lodge (01434 676837; <a href=\"http://www.lyngenlodge.com\">lyngenlodge.com</a>) costs \u00a31,967 full-board including guiding, equipment, boat transport and transfers to and from Troms\u00f8 airport, but not flights.

  "<p>Interviews with classics professors in newspapers went out of fashion roughly around the same time as liberty bodices and national service. Yet mirabile dictu, what should have been featured some weeks ago in the Review section of The Observer if not an interview with a classics professor? To be sure, Mary Beard has always made for good copy. In her ability to make a complex subject accessible to non-specialists, not to mention her occasional aptitude for controversy, she is the closest that her discipline has to a Richard Dawkins. Even so, she is only primus inter pares</p> <p>This autumn, a whole legion of books by heavyweight classicists will be advancing on bookshops. In addition to Beard's study of Pompeii, enthusiasts for ancient history can enjoy biographies of Philip II of Macedonia, Julius Caesar and Attila. Most unexpected of all is a dense yet wholly gripping analysis by Robin Lane Fox of the Greek dark ages, a period that even specialists have always regarded as intimidatingly obscure. Something rather startling is evidently going on: publishers seem to believe that classical scholarship may actually sell. </p> <p>For the practitioners of a discipline that has long been beleaguered by charges of irrelevance and snobbery, this is a heady thought. Even in the Fifties, when a knowledge of Latin and Greek was still held to be the defining mark of the nation's educational elite, the perceived pointlessness of studying dead languages was proving toxic. In How to be Topp, one of Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle's tetralogy of satires about life in a Fifties prep school, the gloriously disaffected Molesworth advised that a Latin lesson could always be brought to a grinding halt by the simple expedient of asking: 'What is the use of Latin, sir?' He went on to describe the result. 'Master clutches the board ruber but he knos he is beaten this one always rouses the mob.' </p> <p>Molesworth was right. Over the past few decades, classicists have suffered a rout on the scale of the Roman defeat at Cannae. A discipline that once enjoyed an Olympian status in the curriculum has been struggling for survival. In the state system, where the carnage has been particularly severe, a bare 15 per cent of secondary schools offer Latin. No surprise, then, that it has ended up more thoroughly the preserve of the privately educated than it was even in Molesworth's time. Hardly the perfect background, you might think, for a sudden explosion of interest in the ancient world.</p> <p>And yet that is exactly what it has provided. The virtual eradication of classical subjects from the state system has left whole swaths of the population educationally disenfranchised: cut off from a knowledge of civilisations that remain no less the bedrock of our own, no less peopled with remarkable figures and famous names, no less fascinating, terrifying and strange than they had ever been. People are not stupid - they know when they are missing out on something interesting and important. If the education system fails to give it to them, then it can hardly be held surprising that they will look for it elsewhere, in works of popular history, perhaps, and in other media as well. </p> <p>It is surely no coincidence that Gladiator, the film that effectively served to fuel the recent obsession with the ancient world, should have been released in 2000, a generation after the final collapse of classical studies in most schools. Maximus's heroics gave people a taste of what had been lost. Nor did it take long for Gladiator to reveal a quality not normally associated with sword-and-sandal fests: prescience. Watch it again now and it seems to display something of the quality of the best science fiction, a portrait of a world that is as weirdly familiar as it is strange, as much about the future as the past. Citizens fed on dazzling entertainments; armies striking at an elusive foreign foe; the hi-tech delivery of weapons of fire. Here, as with Blade Runner, was a mirror being held up to the future. </p> <p>One year on from Gladiator's release and the American response to 9/11 ensured that the comparison of the classical superpower to the modern was transformed into a cliche. The image of George Bush wearing an imperial laurel wreath became a staple of caricatures everywhere. The rise and fall of the Roman empire began to seem not just ancient history, but a theme of pressing immediacy. Even now, with American hegemony looking more frayed than it did at the time of the Iraq War, the world of the classical past continues to cast an eerie shadow. As the critical response to the current exhibition on Hadrian at the British Museum has served to suggest, we find it hard now to look at a Roman and not identify in him something of ourselves. </p> <p>There is nothing new about this. In the Renaissance, when classics as an educational discipline had its birth, Machiavelli had no doubts as to the abiding relevance of the lessons of the Greek and Roman past. 'Prudent men are wont to say,' he wrote, 'and this not rashly or without good ground, that he who would foresee what has to be should reflect on what has been, for everything that happens in the world at any time has a genuine resemblance to what happened in ancient times.' Such a claim, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall, might have appeared outlandish, but now, with the Cold War ended and long-suppressed identities and hatreds emerging from the melting permafrost, it appears a good deal less so. </p> <p>Whether in the Balkans or Georgia, not to mention in the former Roman province of Judaea, the origins of modern conflicts often have very ancient roots indeed. Even in Britain, where the increasingly diverse nature of our society has prompted endless tortured musings on the nature of 'British values', the political and moral ambiguities of classical history suddenly seem possessed of a wholly new relevance. Issues of citizenship, after all - for good and bad - lay at the very heart of the Greek and Roman experience. As in the Renaissance, so now: classical scholarship is coming to seem bizarrely cutting edge.</p> <p>All of which serves to raise a tantalising possibility: that the very devastation to which the discipline has been subjected might end up providing the necessary context for its revival. Perhaps, like any outmoded brand, classics needed to go through a decontamination process. Certainly, it seems now to have purged itself of many of its more rebarbative associations: the fust of chalkdust, the hint of canes and cold showers. </p> <p>Molesworth, describing the desperate flannelling of a classics teacher put on the spot, imagined him protesting: 'Er latin gives you not only the history of Rome but er [hapy inspiration] its culture, it er tells you about interesting men like J Caesar, hannibal, livy, Romulus remus and er lars porsena of clusium.' To Molesworth's classmates, such names would have been a reminder of ink-spattered textbooks and lectures on the vital importance of a stiff upper lip; children today are likeliest to have heard of them from computer games or glossy TV dramas. </p> <p>And if that does inspire some students to contemplate the study of a dead language at school, then at least they will no longer find the educational establishment standing in their way. As Will Griffiths, the director of the Cambridge School Classics Project, puts it: 'When we talk to schools about the possibility of offering Latin, we encounter interest and excitement, not hostility.' </p> <p>Perhaps, then, just perhaps, the rash of books on classical subjects currently appearing in the review pages is indeed the reflection of a broader trend. Certainly, the discipline does appear to have stopped flat-lining. In 2000, there were a mere 150 non-selective state schools in England offering Latin; now there are more than 500.</p> <p>All of which may be so much whistling in the wind. Enthusiasts for classics, like supporters of the England football team, are forever hailing new dawns and invariably end up disappointed. Nevertheless, like a phalanx of scarred and combat-hardened hoplites, classicists remain, at the very least, on the field of battle. Later this year, for instance, an \u00a38m appeal, 'Classics for All', will be launched, with the stated ambition of making classics 'available and sustainable in all state schools'. What prospect there is of raising such a sum in the teeth of a recession remains to be seen, but the organisers of the appeal are no more likely to be daunted by that reflection than the Athenians were by the sight of the enemy on the plain of Marathon. 'Ignis aurum probat': 'It is fire that truly puts gold to the test'.</p> <h2>Five to read: new classical titles</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781861975164\">Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town</a> by Mary Beard (Profile)<br>Whirlwind tour of the lost town, punctuated with cheerful myth-busting by the provocative Beard.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780713999808\">Travelling Heroes</a> by Robin Lane Fox (Allen Lane)<br>Engaging guide to the lives of the Greeks in 800BC, the age of Homer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780300120790\">Philip II of Macedonia</a> by Ian Worthington (Yale)<br>Biography of formidable military commander, better known as Alexander the Great's father.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224076760\">Attila the Hun</a> by Christopher Kelly (Bodley Head)<br>Keenly argued account of the rapacious warlord's assault on the Roman Empire.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781906217693\">Julius Caesar</a> by Philip Freeman (JR Books)<br>Caesar's life was lived on epic scale, as this detailed biography reveals.</p>",
  "<h2>Colour explosion</h2> <p>The pastels and washed-out tones of the past few years are gone - this year, it's all about CMYK. Oh do try to keep up. CMYK means a bold mix of cyan, magenta, yellow and black (K stands for key, which means black in printing circles, apparently). 'The edgier ski and snowboard brands are bringing a very graphic CMYK colour explosion to the party, that celebrates a 1960s/70s psychedelic mood,' says Dave Whitlow, clothing buyer for Ellis Brigham. 'Designers are also having a particular love affair with purple. Fits are more tailored and jackets are a little longer but with a fitted silhouette.' The Westbeach Maverick Jacket, pictured, costs \u00a3139.99 (0870 444 5555; <a href=\"http://www.ellis-brigham.com\">ellis-brigham.com</a>). Women seeking a similar look should check out Burton's almost obscenely garish Vail one-piece (\u00a3245 from Ellis Brigham). </p> <h2>Shrink-to-fit boots</h2> <p>Those who know the agony of poorly fitting ski boots will be delighted with Salomon's latest brainwave - boots that mould to your own feet. For years you've been able to buy boots with soft custom-fit inners, but Salomon's CS Falcon features a hard outer shell which also adapts to fit. The boots are heated in an oven for 20 minutes, you then step inside them and as they cool, they mould to the metatarsal areas of your foot. If it doesn't work first time, you put them back in the oven and try again. The boots start at \u00a3270 and the manufacturers claim that as well as being comfortable, the close fit will increase sensitivity and make you a better skier! (<a href=\"http://www.salomonsports.com\">salomonsports.com</a>)</p> <h2>Skis go off their rocker</h2> <p>This season sees what could be the biggest revolution in ski design since the advent of carvers, nearly 20 years ago. Then, straight skis were abandoned in favour of shaped designs, which were thinner underfoot than at the tip or tail, making it far easier to make fast 'carved' turns - and piste skiing was changed forever. This year, the developments are all about skis specifically designed to make off-piste skiing easier. The first big trend is the 'rocker', sometimes called a 'reverse camber'. </p> <p>Instead of lying flat on the ground, it is bent upwards at the tip and tail, like the runners on a rocking chair. Specialist firms have been playing with the idea for a couple of years, and K2 was the first big manufacturer to introduce the idea on last season's Pontoon ski, but this is the season when the trend has gone mainstream - everyone's at it. The idea is that the tips of the skis naturally float up in deep powder, so skiers can relax and keep their weight over the middle of their feet rather than leaning back. This makes control easier, and the shape also means that the skis pivot easily, so you can turn on a sixpence and also slow down much faster than on conventional skis. This year's new rocker skis include the K2 Obsethed (\u00a3419), the Salomon Lord (\u00a3349) and the Rossignol Bandit DC95 (\u00a3669, including bindings). </p> <p>The other big change is madder still. Whereas normal piste-skis are thinner underfoot, 'negative sidecut' skis are thinner at tip and tail and fatter underfoot. Again, the idea is that they are easier to turn in deep snow, and there's less chance of 'catching' an edge and being thrown off-balance. </p> <p>One word of warning though - while both developments might help your deep-snow skiing no end, these skis are basically useless on hard pistes, so are for powder days only!</p> <h2>Avalanche wristband</h2> <p>The best piece of kit to be wearing if you're caught in an avalanche is probably the Airbag (<a href=\"http://www.abssystem.com\">abssystem.com</a>), a rucksack containing a compressed air cylinder. If you're taken in the snow, you pull a ripcord, two huge airbags inflate and help to carry you to the top of the slide. </p> <p>The problem is that the Airbags cost around \u00a3500, putting them far beyond the means of the impoverished young ski bums who spend most time off-piste. So step forward the Flash Avalanche System (<a href=\"http://www.flash-avalanche.com\">flash-avalanche.com</a>), a French invention. It's a wristband, with a ripcord you pull if caught in an avalanche. This then releases four bright orange ribbons, each 10m long. They don't stop you being buried, but the idea is that rescuers can follow the ribbons to rapidly find you. The best thing is the price - \u20ac55 (\u00a343). </p> <h2>Snowboards go out of binds</h2> <p>If you want to stay down with the kids this season, forget snowboarding; you need to be Noboarding. The Noboard is basically a snowboard with no bindings - instead there are simply rubber pads for you to stand on. Converts say that having the freedom to move your feet around makes it more like skateboarding or surfing. Noboard, a small American company, has been quietly making the board for a cult audience for several years, but this winter could see sales take off after the firm teamed up with snowboarding giant Burton to launch a new board, called the NoFish (\u00a3390; <a href=\"http://www.burton.com\">burton.com</a>).

  "<p>The high drama over Hank Paulson's rescue plan has been so riveting it has relegated everything else to a sideshow - even the collapse of Washington Mutual, the biggest bank failure the US has ever seen. But deeper questions lie beyond the wrangling over the bail-out, as the Archbishops of Canterbury and York highlighted in their interventions in the debate about the future of capitalism. If there is a positive side to this terrible crisis, it is that it has given us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to slay the myth of the omnipotent market. </p> <p>People in the City have never particularly claimed moral justification for their activities, but they were able to assume a mantle of authority because of the sheer volume of money they made - or appeared to make. Almost everybody - politicians, regulators, journalists, voters, mortgage borrowers - accepted the City at its own valuation; whether we approved or not, cowboy capitalism was considered unassailable. </p> <p>Those who argued that enormous bonuses were bad for the fabric of society, because they heightened inequality and undermined people's perception of fairness, were looked upon as unspeakable lefties, or just jealous. Those who argued for stronger regulation were dismissed as meddlers, bureaucrats and stiflers of innovation. And those who were uneasy about certain activities were lectured on how the trickle-down of wealth would benefit everyone.</p> <p>The archbishops were right to say there was an element of idolatry in attitudes towards financial markets; there was a widespread belief that they had a power and life of their own, that we could not control them and should not even try. But markets are there to serve society by allocating capital and supplying financial services; it should not be the case, as some seemed to think, that society should be bent out of shape to serve the interests of the City. There is nothing inevitable about Anglo-American capitalism except its propensity for booms and busts. </p> <p>The liberalisation of financial markets, the retreat of the state and the creed of 'light-touch' regulation began in the Thatcher-Reagan era and advanced unchecked under New Labour. It did appear to deliver greater prosperity, but over that time a number of powerful social contracts were weakened: between employer and employee, government and citizen, lender and borrower. </p> <p>A generation ago, middle class people could reasonably aspire to gain a professional qualification, to work for one company for most or all of their career, to retire on a decent final salary pension and to leave a debt-free legacy to their children. Those assumptions have been eroded by downsizing, outsourcing, pension fund closures, mortgage mis-selling and irresponsible lending. Society has become more unequal, more atomised and, necessarily, more selfish. In an environment where we no longer feel we can rely on being treated decently by the boss or the bank, we are less inclined to show trust and loyalty, for fear of being taken for a mug. It is not surprising that this cultural climate spawned the housing bubble, with millions of individuals placing huge bets on property, believing it was their only chance of achieving financial security for themselves.</p> <p>The government has made a pretty huge bet of its own: that our expertise in financial services would enable the UK to deliver economic prosperity despite cheaper competition from China and other developing nations. Well, what now? I have repeatedly drawn attention to the dangerous neglect of manufacturing, where, even after decades of attrition, we still have some vibrant world-class performers. Perhaps they will get more of the respect they deserve after this. </p> <p>The question 'what now?' applies even more to the US, whose own sovereign credit rating is under siege. The crisis will accelerate the shift in the balance of power towards China and other emerging countries, and will make them far more inclined to pursue their own forms of capitalism.</p> <p>In the excesses of the past few years, some forgot, if they ever knew, that the only way to make sustainable profits is the hard way: by adding genuine value, by providing superior service, by outperforming rivals. We will need to recover our memories pretty quickly.</p> <p>The City and its cheerleaders have rounded on the archbishops, saying that their moral censure may strike a chord with public opinion but is not a serious basis for reform. Maybe not, but the financial sector should not operate in a moral vacuum either. This crisis should prompt us to reappraise our relationship with money and debt, and to think hard about how we can create a fairer and more inclusive version of capitalism. There should be no return to the market's false gods.</p> <h2>More misery to come as B&amp;B folds</h2> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley is this weekend on the brink of becoming the latest bank to succumb to the crisis. It will either be bought in a rescue deal, broken up and sold off, or nationalised along with Northern Rock; the powers the government obtained at that time were not specific to the Newcastle bank and enable it to seize others if need be. </p> <p>More smaller building societies are in need of white knights, as is Belgian bank Fortis - and that is bad news for Royal Bank of Scotland. Fortis was one of RBS's partners in its takeover of ABN Amro, and the Scottish bank risks ending up saddled with unwanted assets that were meant to go to the Belgians. </p> <p>Whether or not there is a banking bail-out here, there will be thousands more job losses in the financial sector. The idea that it just affects the City is myth; there are big hubs in places like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds and Swindon. </p> <p>The banks have yet to see the worst of bad debts and repossessions. The Bank of England is expected to reduce base rates but the gap between base and the three-month Libor rate, at which banks lend to each other, is at its widest since Britain left the ERM in 1992. That tells us two things: banks' mutual mistrust is running very high, and there is no immediate prospect of lower mortgage rates. </p> <p>In the US, hundreds of billions of dollars of banking risk will be transferred to the federal government, adding to America's huge burden of debt and increasing its reliance on foreign investors. The dollar is likely to fall further and the yield on US government debt is likely to rise. Policymakers face formidable challenges: fighting the fire, then repairing the financial system while keeping a lid on inflation, then putting in place effective new regulation. The worst is still to come.</p>",
  "<p>The British government is attempting to torpedo a section of an international plan to eradicate tax evasion in a move that has sparked widespread condemnation. </p> <p>The Observer has established that the UK is lobbying to remove paragraph 10 from the draft Doha Outcome Document. The document, which is scheduled to be ratified in November, is the most important element in the international process intended to help developing countries wean themselves off aid and establish sustainable economies. </p> <p>Paragraph 10 focuses on fighting tax evasion. It aims to encourage global tax information-sharing and simplified tax laws. Most crucially, it wants to upgrade the UN's tax-expert panel to intergovernmental status, elevating the importance of the issue of individual and corporate tax avoidance and evasion.</p> <p>The UK, together with the US, Canada and Australia, are opposed to the measure, according to sources in the UN. </p> <p>John Christensen, director of Tax Justice Network, said: 'The European Parliament last week made a strong statement demanding the commission support this document. Britain is out on a limb within Europe. It's the usual suspects of the US, UK, Australia and Canada. These are the countries that created the toxic financial crisis undermining the global economy. Seemingly lessons have not been learnt.'</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: 'The UK makes an active contribution to the existing UN tax committee. It is not clear that an upgrade to the existing committee ... would deliver any additional benefit.' </p> <p>Critics have suggested the UK is blocking paragraph 10 to protect the interests of City law and accountancy firms.</p>",
  "<p>I'm a complete Luddite. I only saw the internet for the first time last September, and I finally got email in June. To me, the computer is a typewriter that glows. I only type with one finger.

  "<p><strong>Lindsay Parry, 31, has spent 12 of the past 15 months with her son Ethan, two, in his isolation room on Ward Eight at Birmingham Children's Hospital. He is being treated for life-threatening complications after receiving several transplanted organs last year.</strong></p> <p>My pregnancy was perfect, but three hours after Ethan was born he brought up green bile. A blockage in his bowel meant he had his first operation at just 18 hours old and his second at 12 days. He's 26 months old now, and since birth he's been to an operating theatre 31 times to have central lines, endoscopies and actual surgery. </p> <p>Ethan was diagnosed with a rare condition called Hirschsprung's disease, which means he ended up with only a small bowel. So he became reliant on Total Parental Nutrition, a liquid mixture of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, to give him the nutrients he needed to keep him alive. But at five months old his liver started to go, because the TPN damaged it. TPN keeps you alive, but it often badly affects your liver. He would bleed, and on one occasion he lost five-sixths of the blood in his body. Ethan was having daily transfusions and was almost ready to go to a hospice when in June 2007, just before his first birthday, he got a transplanted liver, small bowel and pancreas from a three-year-old girl. He would have had no chance if he didn't have a transplant, and a 60 per cent chance of survival if he did. </p> <p>We were told only one in three liver and small bowel transplant patients get the organs they need. Ethan was very lucky. We've spent 12 out of the last 15 months since the transplant living here at the hospital, and been here non-stop since April, because his body initially rejected the organs and holes appeared in the new bowel. I sleep on a camp bed. My husband Stuart comes for 24 hours every weekend, because we run a small business back home in Liverpool. In those 15 months I've seen four or five children who were waiting for a transplant of some sort pass away, including a boy a few weeks ago. Two children on the ward now desperately need new livers. </p> <p>This is the only UK hospital that does small bowel transplants. The trouble is a child's bowel doesn't become available very often. After Ethan's, in June 2007, the next one wasn't until December. The longest any child has survived after transplant is 10 years, but if Ethan's lucky he will live for ever. </p> <p>I feel strongly that the organ donation system should be opt-out and not opt-in. Children are waiting desperately, yet people aren't aware of that and some don't give them. Awareness needs to be raised about the great need for organs for children. When someone dies, organs could be made available because people don't need them after they have gone. I've been touched by the lack of available organs, seen so many children in desperate need and seen how well patients can do after a transplant that I think it should be compulsory to help people by donating organs. If it was the law, it would be normal. </p> <p>We've been given such a special gift by a special family, but if it was the law that wouldn't seem so special.</p>",
  "<p>Why the tone of amazement in your coverage of New Labour's meltdown? I was under the impression that the party had specifically told us our votes were unwanted. Those of us who've needed welfare shouldn't bother voting because 'we are scroungers and part of a culture of dependency'. Trade union votes were unwanted because members were 'Seventies dinosaurs'. Public sector workers had 'left scars on Blair's back' so who cares about them? Similarly Muslims, peace campaigners and those with concerns about the dictatorship of the global market can take a hike.</p> <p>As for Labour party members, their official, democratically determined conference policies included rail re-nationalisation, ending privatisation in the health service and ending council house sell-offs. However, those ministers and MPs who are paid to represent Labour members have reneged on their position as delegates for the party and are pursuing a contrary agenda. So no point even Labour members taking to the polls. <br><strong>Gavin Lewis</strong><br>Manchester</p> <p>The most depressing feature of the poll predicting a Labour meltdown (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/21/labour.polls?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">'Mass poll shows Labour wipeout'</a>, News, last week) is confirmation that the electorate cannot get beyond the traditional reactive switch from a failing government of one mainstream persuasion to another party that has failed Britain in recent living memory - namely the Tories. </p> <p>Mainstream party choice has become ossified between three bland, centre-right Westminster village contestants all signed up to unregulated free market capitalism. They can promote their cosmetic differences happy in the knowledge that the media 'shuts out' a wider debate of the more radical alternatives, reinforced by a fear-based electoral system that persuades people to vote to stop what they don't want, rather than casting their ballot for a party with the positive values and agenda that they actually support. Nothing will change until electoral reform persuades our media to seriously report the full range of political choice. <br><strong>Richard Denton-White</strong><br>Portland, Dorset</p> <p>You had no need to splash an 'exclusive' poll telling us that 'Gordon Brown is set to lead Labour into an election bloodbath'. We have got the message that the media has decided that Labour cannot win the next election, so that all stories about the Prime Minister and/or the government are primarily concerned with the 'trouble' in which both apparently find themselves.</p> <p>You might bear in mind that opinion polls merely record the views of a few hundred people who are not about to cast their votes. They do not 'predict' a far-off result.<br><strong>W Stephen Gilbert</strong><br>Corsham, Wiltshire</p> <p>You state that Labour 'would be virtually extinguished in southern England'. In that case, millions of voters (in this case, Labour) would be left unrepresented. A nation in which this can happen can scarcely be called a representative democracy. </p> <p>In the glad, confident morning of 1997, the Jenkins Commission on the electoral system was set up; the subsequent report was shelved. Although the system Jenkins recommended is flawed, it would at least allow party representation in a region that is more in proportion to the number of votes. Is it too much to hope that Jack Straw and Jacqui Smith will now be converted to the cause of representative democracy and bring forward legislation to bring it about?<br><strong>Simon Gazeley</strong><br>Bath</p> <p>After reading your articles about turmoil in the Labour party and in global finance, I have come to the following conclusion: 'Because of rampant and unregulated capitalism we are liable to lose our homes/pensions/jobs/savings, so at the next general election we all intend to vote Tory.' <br><strong>Sean Hagger</strong><br>Banbury, Oxfordshire</p> <h2>Write to us</h2> <p>Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday). <strong>Fax: 020 7837 7817</strong>.

  "<p>Senior Blairites could be offered jobs under a David Cameron government in the 'national interest', a leading Tory shadow cabinet minister reveals today, in a bid to poach some of Labour's brightest talents and split the party. </p> <p>Michael Gove, the shadow children's secretary, singled out Schools Minister Lord Adonis, but also warmly praised current cabinet ministers James Purnell and the 'outstanding' Hazel Blears. </p> <p>Senior Tories are understood to have privately discussed offering a life raft to a handful of Labour figures facing deep isolation within a party lurching to the left if Labour loses the next election, in a potentially historic realignment of British politics - echoing Tony Blair's thwarted plans to bring Liberal Democrats into his 1997 cabinet. </p> <p>Asked if he believed a Conservative administration could find jobs for figures such as Purnell and Adonis, Gove said: 'Yes I do, ultimately. It's not my job to say who should be doing what if David Cameron is fortunate enough to be entrusted with public office; it would be arrogant and hubristic. But David has said that crucially someone like Andrew Adonis would be welcome to help, and I think it's important in the national interest.'</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview ahead of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Gove also signalled that straightforward tax breaks for marriage demanded by traditionalist Tories are being ruled out in favour of a 'more sophisticated' financial recognition of wedded couples and insisted that unmarried parents would not suffer.</p> <p>Gove also outlined new approaches on childcare, arguing that working mothers were made to feel 'guilty enough' without being lectured about the risks of putting pre-school children in nurseries. The Tory right has argued that toddlers are best nurtured by their own mothers. </p> <p>His remarks reflect a career distinguished by telling his own party uncomfortable truths, defending housebuilders and targets for more pupils to attend university. Cheekily, Gove addressed Labour's conference fringe last week and was well received. If locked in a room with supposed opponents such as Andrew Adonis, Purnell and the Liberal Democrats' David Laws, would they disagree about anything? </p> <p>'I have yet to find a speech of Andrew's outlining policies that I disagree with,' Gove said, adding that, even when Adonis issues press releases attacking him, 'I have the grim feeling I am reading something that has been written for him'.</p> <p>He also identified common ground with Purnell: 'He, like me, is a strong believer in an interventionist foreign policy: not even everyone within New Labour and certainly not everyone in the Conservative camp [is].' Blears, he said, was unfairly underrated by her own side - 'the fact that she came bottom [for deputy leadership] tells you all you need to know about the Labour party'. </p> <p>Gove's words will be viewed by Labour as mischief-making: a spokeswoman for Purnell said yesterday he was 'very happy in the Labour party, thank you'. But while this year's conference is designed to contrast Labour infighting with Conservative unity - particularly between Cameron and shadow chancellor George Osborne - the Tories have their own minefields too. </p> <p>Chief among them is responding to an economic crisis that is threatening to saddle any Tory government with debt, limiting its scope to fund its plans. 'It's the danger that Gordon Brown might have a party on David Cameron's credit card,' Gove conceded, reflecting fears that Labour will borrow heavily in its final months, leaving the bill to the incoming government.</p> <p>Last week alone Labour promised computers for children from poorer families and free nursery places for two-year-olds, albeit not until well after 2011, when Tory pledges to honour Labour spending expire. Could Gove match them - and on nursery places, should he? </p> <p>He said the debate about whether nurseries damage young children's development should be had, but added: 'It's for the parents to decide. Of course, there's an argument over what we can afford but we should make it easier to gain access to childcare. It's hard enough bringing up children without the state or anyone saying \"tsk, tsk\".' </p> <p>The state's role in family life is, none the less, this week's smouldering issue. Cameron argues that supporting marriage could prevent social ills: Osborne is thought to be less convinced, while the shadow secretary of state for innovation, universities and skills David Willetts argued in a pamphlet yesterday that bad housing is as good a predictor of future poverty as family break-up. </p> <p>Gove may well be in the liberal camp. He warned of 'jumping the gun' in assuming that the two options favoured by the Tory right - a straightforward tax allowance for married couples or a transferable allowance benefiting a traditional stay-at-home wife - were the ones under consideration, suggesting Osborne is examining a compromise option. </p> <p>'When we were talking about relieving the burden on drivers, everyone assumed that would mean one type of change to fuel duty. In fact a rather more sophisticated form of change came about,' he said. 'It would be premature to guess which sort of tax changes that we are going to do.'</p> <p>Encouraging stable relationships could be done without penalising unmarried parents who would also benefit from a 'suite of policies' for families: 'If someone were to say to me that our policy were to lead to real disadvantage for any particular existing group, then we would have to look again.'</p> <p>Family policy decisions remain critical for the Tories' toughest target group: women. An Ipsos-MORI poll today for the Fawcett Society think-tank shows that, while 68 per cent of female voters agree British society is 'broken' and nearly three-quarters think the economy is worsening, women remain more suspicious than men of Cameron. </p> <p>Perhaps it is no coincidence then that Gove accuses Labour of being aggressively macho, sympathising with Ruth Kelly's decision to quit the cabinet on family grounds. 'Team Brown has a beery, brawly, football club feel to it, and the people who have said \"I want out\" - Siobhan McDonagh, Joan Ryan, Ruth - are decent, very hard-working female ministers'.</p> <p>As for himself, Gove says that the driving force behind his ideas - chiefly a Swedish-style system which would allow alternative providers to set up new schools - is knowing that 'all the opportunities I had were the consequences of parents who were prepared to make sacrifices for my education'. </p> <p>They sent him private: Gove's solution is more flagship comprehensives like London's new Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney - a product of Adonis's academy programme. Could the Labour peer one day supervise it under the Tories?</p>",
  "<p>Europe's anti-terror chief has launched a stinging attack on the political correctness that he says is hampering the campaign against militant Islam.</p> <p>Gilles de Kerchove, the EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator, said last week that concern about stigmatising Muslim populations was hampering policy-making and thus prevention. 'One of the problems ... is that some member states are extremely reluctant to be explicit about the link with religion,' said de Kerchove. 'Religion has been hijacked and distorted for political ends.'</p> <p>De Kerchove's statement comes against a background of infighting within the EU over counter-terrorism policy. The European Commission has been working for several years on a paper analysing militancy in Europe and outlining policy to combat radicalisation. The Council of Ministers is still waiting for the now long-overdue paper, on which future policy will be based.</p> <p>EU officials claimed last week the delay was because Jacques Barrot, the French Commissioner for justice, freedom and security, had grave reservations about the definition of terrorism in the commission's policy paper and had delayed signing the policy document as it 'went too far in blaming Muslim communities'.</p> <p>A spokesman for Barrot refused to comment. 'There is a paper that is being prepared. Our services are working on it and there is no fixed timeframe at the moment,' he said.</p> <p>De Kerchove praised the Home Office's emphasis on countering the extremists' message through the media. 'We have to provide an alternative narrative,' he said. 'A lot of research is showing that young people being radicalised are looking for thrills as much as anything ideological. We need to show the violence for what it is, bloody and indiscriminate, and the people who do it for what they are, ugly criminals not heroes.'</p>",
  "<p>The encounter had the makings of a deliciously brutal confrontation. Billionaire investor Barry Diller had given his yacht over to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rupertmurdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a> for the evening. New York's smartest partygoers were toasting the Australian-born tycoon's recent takeover of the Dow Jones company and its prized asset, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wallstreetjournal\">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p>As they bobbed merrily around New York harbour, the mood seemed more one of celebration. But then Murdoch fell into conversation with Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of the Journal's arch-rival, the New York Times. By buying the Journal, Murdoch had parked his tanks directly on the NYT's lawn. What, people wondered, would the two make of each other?</p> <p>Disappointingly, perhaps, there was no showdown, no baring of teeth or flexing of muscle. The two chatted amiably and Sulzberger assured Murdoch he need not worry about an editorial in the next morning's paper, addressing Murdoch's new purchase.</p> <p>But when the piece appeared, Murdoch was not pleased. It spoke of how he had bowed to political pressure from the Chinese government to protect his business interests and how, in Britain, he had allegedly interfered in the running of the Times. With characteristic bluntness, Murdoch fired off a handwritten letter to Sulzberger: 'Dear Arthur, it was a pleasure to meet you last night...' it began. Then, after furiously denying the (often-repeated) accusations, it ended bluntly: 'Let the battle begin.'</p> <p>And so it has. The two greatest names in American journalism are now heading for an old-fashioned newspaper war. Like two heavyweight prizefighters, the NYT and the Journal are squaring off in a battle for money, readers and, perhaps most importantly, political influence. </p> <p>In one corner is Murdoch, a man famed for making millions by tearing down established orders, whether breaking unions in Britain, or pushing the nakedly partisan Fox News channel in America. His weapon of choice now is a ramped up Journal, turning Wall Street's bible into a force to bring down the liberal icon of the New York Times.</p> <p>Opposing him is Sulzberger, the head of the wealthy Ochs Sulzberger clan, who have owned the NYT for more than 100 years. They are establishment to their bones and exactly the type of opponent Murdoch likes to take on.</p> <p>Suddenly, the ghosts of duelling press barons of the past, like William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, are stalking Manhattan's streets. The stakes are high. As Hearst once famously said: 'You can crush a man with journalism.'</p> <p>But this time the skills needed to win are not only the ability to scoop or scandalise your opponent, but the expertise to survive in an industry that is changing beyond recognition. The modern newspaper world, facing the challenge of the internet, is not a place that Hearst nor Pulitzer could have imagined. While Murdoch and Sulzberger go to war, the very industry they are fighting for may be dying beneath their feet.</p> <p>It was 13 December last year - a date that will 'live in infamy', according to one media commentator - when Murdoch appeared on the Journal's newsroom floor for the first time. He faced a sceptical staff. The Journal had long been owned by the aristocratic Bancroft family and, for decades, had practised journalism as a kind of archaic science, secure in its role reporting America's financial elite. Its pictureless front page and dense columns of print seemed unchanged from the Nineties. Yet here was its new owner, a man whose Sun newspaper gave the world bare-breasted Page 3 Girls and who had turned Britain's Times into a tabloid.</p> <p>Murdoch - lacking a stage but with the entire newspaper now his platform - stood on top of a few boxes of printing paper and surveyed the crowd: 'Naturally this is a day of great excitement for us,' he said. Then, showing a gift for understatement, he added: 'Maybe it's more a day of nervousness for you.'</p> <p>Just a bit. When Murdoch won control of the Journal by buying out the Bancrofts and coughing up more than $5bn (\u00a32.72bn), America's journalistic community was mortified. Murdoch was portrayed as a barbarian at the gate of one of America's most prized institutions. It was as though McDonald's had bought the Cipriani dining dynasty. Or Wal-Mart had snapped up Macy's.</p> <p>Some journalists jumped ship, fleeing what they imagined would be Murdoch's baleful influence. Others rallied around their managing editor, Marcus Brauchli. But then Brauchli suddenly 'resigned' and was replaced by Robert Thomson, one of Murdoch's most trusted lieutenants, transferred from the Times in London. It seemed to confirm everyone's worst fears. Brauchli was meant to be untouchable; now he was gone. American journalism waited for the worst. And waited. And waited.</p> <p>They are still waiting. Murdoch is undoubtedly a tabloid pirate - a swashbuckler of the printed word who has long wanted a premier American newspaper brand to add to his holdings. (He already has a TV network, a cable news channel, a movie studio and the ultimate tabloid in the shape of the brash New York Post.) But he knows that the Journal's worth lies in its quality. The hyperbolic predictions that he would bring Page 3 values to his new paper have fallen far wide of the mark. Murdoch did not buy the newspaper to trivialise it.</p> <p>Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff, one of America's most respected media commentators, who is writing a book about Murdoch, says: 'He is not a one-dimensional figure. There is a good Rupert Murdoch and a bad Rupert Murdoch. They co-operate with each other. They exist alongside each other.' Or, in the words of former Journal managing editor Paul Steiger: 'I see no evidence, nor do my friends there report any evidence, of the bad Rupert showing up.'</p> <p>The fact is, Murdoch is a businessman before he is an ideologue. He has invested billions buying a newspaper and he wants to make the Journal a more powerful force, not a down-market one. Though the Journal's political clout could be vital for promoting News Corp's wider interests, 'most of what Murdoch does is less an exercise in ideology than a smart business move', according to Rick Edmonds, a media expert at the Poynter Institute journalism school in Florida.</p> <p>As a result, Murdoch has plunged himself personally into the project. He has made regular walk-throughs of the newsroom and printing works, held meetings with editors and personally telephoned top journalists to ask them to stay. Several heeded that call. He has surprised many by his knowledge of minuscule details of the newspaper's operations. </p> <p>But no one should be surprised. Murdoch's mission is simple. He wants to turn the Journal into the biggest journalistic force in America. Of course, to fulfil that mission he has to defeat the newspaper that currently sits on the throne: the New York Times.</p> <p>It probably pleases Murdoch that he is taking on the NYT at a vulnerable moment in its history. Though it sells just 1.07 million copies a day - far from huge in a country of 300 million - it remains the newsletter of America's elite, and sets the political agenda like no other news organisation. </p> <p>But it has been hit by a collapse in advertising revenues that has swept through the newspaper industry, shredding profits. In April, Standard &amp; Poor's rated the NYT's debt rating as just above junk status. The group has vowed to cut $230m of costs next year. It has shed 100 journalists' jobs. 'We hope that the worst is behind us,' editor Bill Keller wrote in a recent memo.</p> <p>That might be a forlorn hope. The NYT's share price is collapsing. Six years ago it stood at more than $50 a share. Now it is less than $14. 'It is amazing to watch the once-premier brand in American journalism become worth so little. That is shocking,' says Choire Sicha, who writes about the media in the New York Observer.</p> <p>It would be difficult to imagine styles of ownership more different than Murdoch and the Ochs Sulzbergers. The latter are a relic of the days when great newspapers were run by private families. They are the descendents of Adolph Ochs, who bought the NYT in 1896. The family treats the newspaper as its reason to exist, initiating younger members in its ways and holding gatherings to discuss it. Tradition is important. Out of deference to his father, Arthur Sulzberger is still called 'the young Sulzberger', despite being 57 and having run the company for a decade. Bizarre as it might sound, it is reported that the Sulzberger clan sing the Sister Sledge song 'We are Family' at business get-togethers. You can be fairly sure Murdoch does not do that.</p> <p>There is also some concern about the NYT's management culture. Being at the pinnacle for so long, critics say, has created an air of arrogance and complacency. Though some critics are undoubtedly simply envious of NYT journalists, there is also truth in the statement. Even former editors admit that this could be a problem. 'In the old days we could be arrogant and complacent with the ad revenues still coming in. They were unstoppable. Not now,' says former NYT editor Howell Raines. </p> <p>Sharks have been circling for a while. Two years ago, a Morgan Stanley investment manager, Hassan Elmasry, tried to use his share of the company to change the family ownership structure. He failed. But another challenge swiftly followed, led by hedge-fund manager Scott Galloway. He and his allies ended up owning 20 per cent of the company and won two places on the family-dominated board. That could lessen the power of Sulzberger rule. Indeed, rumours are rife of revolutionary changes. Some hope New York's billionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, may ride to the rescue and take over. Others think Google could buy the newspaper. Or perhaps the family could take the paper fully private again.</p> <p>It has not helped that the newspaper's journalism - as well as its finances - has also fallen upon difficult times. The paper has still not fully recovered from the Jayson Blair scandal five years ago, where a young reporter was found to have fabricated stories. Even more damaging was the furore over Judith Miller, a national security reporter who was forced to 'retire' from the paper after series of reports in which her sources suggested Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. One scandal fuelled the fires of conservative enemies, while the other outraged liberal supporters. </p> <p>But, despite the gathering storm clouds, it would be a mistake to underestimate the newspaper. Staffing levels are still the envy of other titles. It still produces wonderful journalism. It would also be a mistake to dismiss Sulzberger. Almost since birth he has been seen as the torchbearer for the family: he joined the NYT as a reporter in its Washington bureau at the age of 27. He once said the newspaper was his 'religion'. He has shown an able grasp of the changes affecting the industry, spotting trouble well ahead and eagerly embracing the internet. Behind the veneer of aristocratic elitism is a man who has lived with the NYT his whole life and already steered it through very rough times. It would be a dreadful mistake for Murdoch to write him off. Or the newspaper that he heads.</p> <p>The battle has already begun. Thomson, the Journal's managing editor, has not wasted any time since leaving Wapping. He's ready for a dust-up, pointing to the circulation gap between the NYT and his paper, which sells more than two million copies a day (almost twice as many as its rival). </p> <p>'The Wall Street Journal is the pre-eminent US newspaper, not the New York Times, which sells far fewer copies and is clearly in decline,' he tells me.</p> <p>Thomson began his career as a teenage copy boy in Melbourne, where one of his duties was to fetch milkshakes so hacks could line their bellies before an afternoon boozing session. </p> <p>At the New York Times, some staff have reacted with amusement to the Journal's challenge. A recent memo sent out by the NYT online editor Jonathan Landman mocked the paper's new rival. 'There's some financial newspaper out there, on Wall Street maybe, or maybe in Midtown, we aren't sure. There's new ownership, some rich guy says he wants his paper to be more like ours...' it began. That's fighting talk too. Many experts agree that the NYT's position is strong. 'There is a good deal of swagger about the Times. I don't think it is that shook up by Murdoch,' says Edmonds of the Poynter Institute.</p> <p>Landman's email reflected the NYT's belief that it will remain top of the heap. But his analysis of Murdoch's plans appears to be spot on. The Journal is indeed transforming from a business paper to a broader, national paper. The emphasis is on more news, shorter stories, greater international coverage and a broader choice about what matters to Journal readers. A sports page is being added. So is a lifestyle magazine. A study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed the Journal's business coverage was down 50 per cent, while political coverage had tripled. The results have seen sceptics praise the paper and, sometimes begrudgingly, Murdoch too. 'Even card-carrying members of the commentariat, who were wishing us ill, have conceded that the paper is in great shape,' Thomson says.</p> <p>Murdoch is investing in newspapers as others flee. But there are factors in play that should scare both Murdoch and Sulzberger alike. For the brutal truth is that while the Journal and the NYT fight it out, many believe the newspaper industry they are battling in is facing extinction.</p> <p>In a dimly lit room above a theatre in Greenwich Village, a handful of New York media figures gathered recently to discuss the future of journalism. It was a suitably low-key setting that reflected the industry's dire straits: there was no air-conditioning, and cheap wine was served along with sweaty cubes of cheese. 'If you are here, you know what the problem is,' former Journal managing editor Steiger told the crowd 'The media is getting hammered.'</p> <p>No one disagreed. An online revolution has swept through the media world battering every newspaper in the country - taking away readers, slashing ad revenues and wiping out jobs. Blogs and websites fill the internet with the latest breaking news or commentary and they do it for free. Younger people rarely read newspapers, considering them as out-of-date as vinyl records or videotapes. </p> <p>This year a tipping point was reached. 'It was the perfect storm,' says Jack Lule, a journalism professor at Lehigh University. The litany of disaster is long: the Atlanta Journal-Constitution lost 73 jobs, the Modesto Bee 160, the Cincinnati Enquirer 50, the Birmingham News 80, the Newark Star-Ledger 200, the Orange County Register 90. That is just a sample. Some 85 per cent of large daily newspapers lost jobs. So far in 2008, more than 7,000 people have been laid off. Old hands, such as former New York Times editor Raines, see it as a catastrophe. He used to tell media students worried about the future that he cared only that newspapers survive until 2008, as he had to retire then. 'I meant it as a joke,' he says. 'But 2008 turned out to be the real watershed.'</p> <p>The change will have a profound impact on America. Optimists point out that the internet has democratised information, allowing anyone to publish or comment. It has ended the role of journalists as gatekeepers of information, dictating what the public should know. </p> <p>But, at the same time, the loss of a vibrant newspaper culture worries those in the industry, who fear especially the decline of the investigative journalism that once defined top newspaper reporting. 'It will be terrible for civic society. For today and the foreseeable future the vast majority of investigative journalism is done by newspapers, not by bloggers. The average citizen will get much less information and, sadly, most people are not aware of that,' says Charles Kaiser, who writes the Full Court Press media column for Radar magazine. </p> <p>It is a grim vision of the future and pessimism is not hard to find. Nor is anger that it has come to this - that American newspapers have realised too late that their audience has left them and their world has changed. </p> <p>In speaking of the future, Wolff, one of New York's top media writers, is clearly angry. His voice rises to a mix of rage and despair. 'I don't think there will be a newspaper industry in 20 years,' he says. As for the current crop of editors who, perhaps, woke up too late to the new reality: 'They are fucking imbeciles. They deserve it and they deserve it in a profound way.' </p> <p>Raines, too, sees only a dark future for newspapers brought on by the new technology. In his Southern drawl, he recounts the story of his father, whose first job was working in a horse-collar factory in a small Alabama town. Then one day he watched in amazement as a motorcar drove into town, ushering in a new world. Raines said the internet has done the same for newspapers: 'My father didn't know that car would put the horse-collar factory out of business,' he says. 'But it did, of course.'</p> <p>Set against this backdrop, the war between the Journal and the NYT begins to take on a sepia hue. It looks less like a battle for future influence, than a fight from a past era. For, in future, media wars will not be fought between newspapers, and perhaps not even between newspaper websites. They will be fought between internet brands, blogs, online video sharers, news aggregators, gossip sites and things as yet undreamt of. They will not be fought in one city nor one country, but across the globe. They will not be fought with the buying of a newspaper, but with the click of a mouse, or a button on an iPhone, or a text.</p> <p>If the ghosts of long-dead press barons are looking at Murdoch and Sulzberger, they will be doing so knowing they might be looking at a final hurrah. This newspaper war may be fierce, the stakes may be high and the passions intense - but it may also be the last of its kind.</p> <h2> New York Times </h2> <p><strong>First published</strong>: 1851</p> <p><strong>Edited by:</strong> Bill Keller </p> <p><strong>Circulation:</strong> approximately 1.077m</p> <p><strong>Finest hour: </strong>publication of the 'Pentagon Papers', detailing America's involvement in Vietnam, in 1971. </p> <p><strong>Darkest hour:</strong> 2003 revelation that junior reporter Jayson Blair plagiarised stories. </p> <h2> The Wall Street Journal </h2> <p><strong>First published:</strong> 1889 </p> <p><strong>Edited by:</strong> Robert Thomson </p> <p><strong>Circulation:</strong> 2m worldwide. </p> <p><strong>Finest hour: </strong>exposing insider trading in 1988. </p> <p><strong>Darkest hour:</strong> Vicious squabbling among family shareholders last year after Murdoch tabled a bid for the paper.</p>",
  "<p>The Taliban have been engaged in secret talks about ending the conflict in Afghanistan in a wide-ranging 'peace process' sponsored by Saudi Arabia and supported by Britain, The Observer can reveal.</p> <p>The unprecedented negotiations involve a senior former member of the hardline Islamist movement travelling between Kabul, the bases of the Taliban senior leadership in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and European capitals. Britain has provided logistic and diplomatic support for the talks - despite official statements that negotiations can be held only with Taliban who are ready to renounce, or have renounced, violence. </p> <p>Sources in Afghanistan confirmed the controversial talks, though they said that in recent weeks they had 'lost momentum'. According to Afghan government officials in Kabul, the intensity of the fighting this summer has been one factor. Another is the inconsistency of the Taliban's demands. </p> <p>'They keep changing what they are asking for. One day it is one thing, the next another,' one Afghan government adviser with knowledge of the negotiations said. One aim of the initiative is to drive a wedge between Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda and the Taliban. </p> <p>Last week the French Prime Minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, referred indirectly to the talks during a parliamentary debate on Afghanistan. 'We must explore ways of separating the international jihadists from those who are acting more for nationalist or tribal motives. Efforts in this direction are being led by Sunni [Muslim] countries such as Saudi Arabia,' he said.</p> <p>This summer's fighting season in Afghanistan has been the most violent since the invasion of 2001. The deterioration of the situation has provoked a major review of strategy among the 40-nation international coalition pitted against an increasingly confident and effective insurgency.</p> <p>Although there have been low-level contacts with individual Taliban commanders at district level before, the Saudi initiative is the first attempt to talk to the Taliban leadership council based in or around the south-west Pakistan city of Quetta, known as the 'Quetta Shura'.</p> <p>The talks started in the summer and have been brokered by Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the Afghan government. The go-between has spent weeks ferrying lists of demands and counter-demands between the Afghan capital, Riyadh and Quetta. He has also visited London to speak to Foreign Office and MI6 personnel. A delegation from Saudi intelligence has also visited Kabul. </p> <p>The Taliban are understood to have submitted a list of 11 conditions for ending hostilities, which include demands to be allowed to run key ministries and a programmed withdrawal of western troops. </p> <p>In Kabul, President Hamid Karzai's national security adviser, Zalmay Rasul, has been in charge of the negotiations. It is understood that Karzai has yet to make a formal response to the demands, leading to frustration among some western officials. </p> <p>The Observer has also learnt of a separate exchange of letters in the summer between Karzai and the Taliban ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The dialogue proved fruitless.</p> <p>Late last year Karzai said he would welcome the chance to speak directly to Hekmatyar and to Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's leader and one of the most wanted men in the world, promising that if the Taliban demanded a 'department in this or in that ministry or ... a position as deputy minister' in exchange for ending violence, he would give them the posts.</p> <p>Previously Taliban spokesmen have said that only the departure of foreign troops, the institution of a fiercely rigorous interpretation of sharia law and a share of government would be acceptable to them as the basis for any deal.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday that he had no knowledge of the 'Saudi initiative', as it is known in diplomatic circles, but that the British government 'actively supported the Afghan government's reconciliation process', which was 'part and parcel of the counter-insurgency campaign'.</p> <p>In another development, The Observer has learnt that the British government is considering increasing the length of tours served by troops in Afghanistan. The Ministry of Defence confirmed last week that tours for senior soldiers in key command positions are set to be extended from six months to a year.</p> <p>'We are looking at increasing tour lengths for a small number of headquarters posts ... with the aim of creating greater continuity in key positions,' an MoD spokesman said.</p> <p>Although the MoD denied any plans to extend other service personnel's combat tours in Afghanistan, the idea of troops deployed to the area serving nine months was raised recently by the army's director of infantry, Brigadier Richard Dennis, in a speech to senior commanders. </p> <p>Washington is putting pressure on Nato allies such as Britain to match American troop increases.</p>",
  "<p>When a debut novel arrives heralded by a seven-figure advance in America and comparisons with Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose and Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, you approach it with a mixture of curiosity and scepticism. Both attitudes will be rewarded: Andrew Davidson's The Gargoyle is undoubtedly a wildly imaginative collage of stories, but it is almost certainly one of the worst pieces of writing you will come across this year. The elevated literary company in which it has been placed turns out to be the usual lazy shorthand of publicists and booksellers; it resembles The English Patient only in that both feature a burns victim and The Name of the Rose only in that both contain the word 'scriptorium'.</p> <p>The book begins with the nameless narrator's plunge into Hell: a beautiful, soulless porn star with a coke habit and a life of empty indulgence, he is driving drunk one night when his car speeds over a cliff and bursts into flames. Waking into a severe burns unit, his narrative swings between detailed accounts of the procedures of treating major burns and recollections of his abused childhood. The latter are so one-dimensional as to be of little interest in any understanding of his character; the former appeal to our fascination with the mutilation of the human body and are compelling. </p> <p>Most of us have given little thought to the painstaking work of rebuilding charred bodies and there is no doubt that Davidson has done his research: the process of debridement, for example - the regular cutting away of putrefying flesh, 'not unlike the way a vegetable peeler removes skin from food' - is described clinically. So much so, in fact, that you suspect he has lifted much of it from medical textbooks (two are credited in his acknowledgements).</p> <p>By his own account, the narrator has been a thoroughly unlikable character before the accident, his every move driven by the pursuit of pleasure, regardless of consequences, so that at first there is little room for the reader's sympathy (particularly not for the loss of his busy penis). He does, however, explain that he escaped his unhappy trailer park childhood by spending all his time in libraries, thus rendering his tendency suddenly to spout torrents of medieval history almost plausible. </p> <p>Between his rounds of grisly treatments, he is visited by a beautiful woman called Marianne Engel, who seems to recognise him and is convinced that they were lovers in 14th-century Germany, when she was a nun and he a mercenary. Marianne turns out to be a psychiatric patient exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia, but is also a talented sculptor who makes a fortune carving gargoyles for wealthy collectors and celebrities.</p> <p>As the narrator lies in hospital recovering, Marianne sits by his bedside and weaves Sheherazade-like tales from Italy, Japan, Iceland and England, in which love outlasts death. She also tells him the story of their first meeting, when he was brought to the monastery of Engelthal after being hit by a flaming arrow and she nursed him back to health and inspired him to live, just as her 21st-century incarnation is doing. Along the way, there are digressions on the processes of medieval manuscript production, masonry, sculpture, porn and skin grafts.</p> <p>As a work of imagination, The Gargoyle is original and daring; the problem is that the author's talent as a writer does not match the audacity of that imagination. Davidson's prose is so lumpen and banal that his sentences make the reader wince far more than any of the medical procedures he describes. Despite all his background reading, he fails to find the alchemy that brings a story to life. In part, he is hampered by the static nature of his frame story; with his narrator immobile in a sealed ward, there is little that can happen in the present-day narrative, which may account for the lengthy descriptions of every meal Marianne brings him.</p> <p>Yet there are moments that spark into life; the 14th-century story of Marianne and the mercenary is so much more interesting that it seems a pity he didn't just write that and dispense with the rest of the book. Towards the end, the narrator, in morphine withdrawal, hallucinates a journey through Dante's Inferno. This is the most vivid episode of the whole novel, yet as the writing gains intensity and momentum, the narrator undercuts the visionary quality with his habitual unfunny wisecracking. The phantasmagorical illusion instantly deflates and seems ridiculous, as if the author is afraid fully to commit to the imaginative world of his story.</p> <p>The Gargoyle is an oblique version of the Beauty and the Beast tradition, a testament to the redemptive power of love, but its ambitious reach can't disguise a truly pedestrian effort that would have benefited from some serious editorial debridement. It's bound to be an international bestseller.</p>",
  "<p>The All Blacks were playing England, and after the half-time whistle blew they found themselves 50-0 ahead, Jonah Lomu scoring eight tries. The rest of the team decided to head for the pub instead of playing the second half, leaving Jonah to go out on his own. 'No worries,' said Jonah, 'I'll join you later and tell you what happened.'</p> <p>After the game Jonah headed for the pub where he told his team-mates the final score: 95-3. 'What!' said a furious Michael Jones. 'How did you let them get three points?'</p> <p>Jonah replied apologetically: 'I was sent off with 20 minutes to go.'</p> <p>(New Zealand rugby joke, circa 1995)</p> <p>No one is quite sure when England started playing boring rugby. I ask Eddie Butler, The Observer's rugby correspondent, and he goes silent for a few seconds before suggesting, '1923, I suppose, more or less.' Think of the French, and you picture exuberance and extroversion, a wave of blue shirts running the ball out from behind their posts. The Welsh have always produced players who appear to be worryingly frail, but who prosper by sleight of hand and whirring feet and make fools out of the lumbering forwards. The southern hemisphere has, seemingly from the start, played an athletic, mobile game defined by innovation and all-round excellence.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country that invented the game traditionally play at their own pace. At their best, England are brutal, formidable, obdurate and efficient. They are never easy to beat - always strong, well prepared and never lacking courage - but they are not always very good at winning games. They experimented with expansive, daring rugby for 80 minutes back in 1991 and found that it was not for them; that occasion, regrettably, was the World Cup final against Australia at Twickenham, an afternoon that still rankles with some of those on the field: 'They were playing totally against their nature, as eight forwards will tell you to this day,' Butler says.</p> <p>The archetypal English player is rugged and fearless, not afraid to mix it up. Their approach is caution first, keep it tight, get the three points in the bag. They prided themselves on being the first nation to embrace professionalism, bringing a new physicality to rugby. Think of the heroes of 2003: Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny Wilkinson - is it my imagination or did they, after years of battering, even start to look alike? Their heroic jaws jutting out, expressions glowering and taciturn, their faces like 'a Christmas present from Easter Island', as Philip Larkin memorably described Ted Hughes. Certainly, these are the men whose shadows loom large over the game in England.</p> <p>The flip side is that you can almost count the number of flamboyant English players on one hand. There was Prince Alexander Obolensky, whose family fled the Russian Revolution in 1917, before settling in Muswell Hill, north London. 'The Prince' made his England debut in 1936 in a 13-0 victory against the All Blacks; he scored two tries, including one individual effort that covered most of the field and may be the greatest ever scored in England colours. Sadly, he would win just three more caps, and the flying winger died in 1940 at the age of 24, when his Hawker Hurricane crashed in Suffolk. They don't make them like that any more.</p> <p>Who else? In the late Sixties, David Duckham possessed the most outrageous sidestep in the game and the ability to send TV cameras the wrong way with his dummy. He made his greatest impact on the British Lions tour to New Zealand in 1971, when he scored 11 tries and was renamed 'Dai' by Welsh supporters, but that was not enough for England to build a team around him. Even greater injustice befell the mercurial Bath fly-half Stuart Barnes, who won just 10 England caps in the Eighties, as selectors preferred his metronomic rival Rob Andrew (the architect of that 1991 defeat). In recent times, only Jeremy Guscott and Jason Robinson have threatened to break the mould, but being isolated at outside centre and on the wing and full-back, respectively, their impact has been fleeting, a tantalising glimpse of what could be possible.</p> <p>Then on 15 March this year, England played Ireland in the final round of the Six Nations. The match was ostensibly a dead rubber - both sides had won two, lost two, and the title would be fought out between Wales and France - but it did not take long to realise that something special, perhaps even culture-changing, was taking place at Twickenham. Ireland built an early 10-0 lead, but England regrouped and posted 33 unanswered points; it was a performance of composure, fluidity and vibrant rugby, the likes of which many home fans had never experienced. Moreover, the inspiration was a 20-year-old kid in a scrum cap playing at fly-half in his first full international. 'I just thought it was one of the most outstanding individual performances I have ever, ever seen,' says Lawrence Dallaglio now. 'And I include any sportsman across the world in that estimation.'</p> <p>And this is why I am currently in a photographic studio in west London with three near-naked models and Danny Cipriani, looking right now like the cat that got the cream, the sardines and a date with Kelly Brook.</p> <p>Danny Cipriani is a handsome man, and you suspect that he does not need reassuring of this fact. 'Not too shabby,' one of the models says as we stand over a Polaroid and, despite himself, he cannot stop a smile escaping. It is not unprecedented for rugby players to start out with these looks, but the necessity to bulk up for the game and a few years at the bottom of a ruck tend to add a little more 'character' to their faces. Whether Cipriani is a good enough player to stop that happening is one of the things that we will have to find out.</p> <p>Much has happened in the six months since the Ireland game - notably a career-threatening injury and those nights out with Brook, more of which later - but it is the hope and excitement that Cipriani inspired that day that remain top of the agenda. Just as Jonny Wilkinson knew from the age of eight that he would play for England, there was something preordained about Cipriani's rise. The night before the game, he sat up in bed and realised that he had been dreaming about this moment all his life. He had been warned that he would probably only sleep for four hours, but not to worry, that would not affect his performance the next day. He was ready.</p> <p>'Right from an early age he was ambitious enough to say that he was going to be England fly-half, he had that inner belief,' says Adrian Norris, the director of sport and first XV coach at Cipriani's secondary school, Whitgift in Croydon. Norris's most vivid memory of the schoolboy remains the first time he saw him play, aged 14. 'He did about five things,' he recalls, 'the first thing was a spiral kick off his left foot the full length of the pitch, which was admirable at that particular time but not outstanding; the next play he did exactly the same thing off his right foot; the next two things were an accurate long miss pass, one off his left hand and one off his right hand. He had a tendency at that age to try absolutely anything. Whereas most people would put a grubber-kick through, he would put a grubber-kick through with the outside of his wrong foot. That sort of stuff.'</p> <p>Cipriani was obviously a precocious natural talent: his skills extended to football, where he was offered terms by Reading; to cricket, where he might have played for Surrey; and to athletics, where he competed in high jump and 200 metres at the Track and Field Schools' Cup. But by age 15, he had joined London Wasps, just as the club began their domination of English rugby, and he was playing age-group rugby for England. Still he was not satisfied. To make the next step, in his last year at school, he sought out the services of fitness coach Margot Wells, the wife of Allan Wells, the 1980 Olympic 100m champion, and an irrepressible, hugely likeable woman who has been his trainer and confidante ever since. (For the record, Cipriani paid for his sessions out of his own pocket then, and still does now.)</p> <p>'My job is to give him the physical and mental qualities so he can do whatever he wants,' says Wells, sounding like Alfred Pennyworth to Bruce Wayne's Batman. 'And I just knew from day one that he wanted to be this superstar, wanted to play for England, wanted to play at the highest level he could play. He was 18 when we started and, to be honest, you very rarely get that level of dedication and commitment from someone so young. They normally grow into it, but he had it at the very beginning; he said, \"I want to be the best. I want you to make me the best that I can be.\" That's easy for me, I love that.'</p> <p>If people know one thing about Jonny Wilkinson, it is that he will stay out practising kicking until the balls disintegrate into rags. If they know one thing about Cipriani, it is probably the News of the World story that he spent the night with a woman called Larissa Summers, who was reportdely a transsexual. That subsequently turned out to be false, though not before the Wasps dressing room had given him the post-modern nickname 'Danny Cipriani Who Slept With A Man'. But, everyone agrees, Cipriani has a formidable work ethic of his own and considerable reserves of mental fortitude. Thanks to his work with Wells, he is now the quickest player at Wasps, faster even than his England team-mate Paul Sackey.</p> <p>'Danny is not obsessive about any part of his game,' Wells says. 'He will work equally on his speed as he will on his skills as he will on his kicking. He works exceedingly hard, he's very diligent in what he does, and he's dedicated to being the best he can be in a very all-round manner. But he's not obsessive. Obsessive to me means overdoing things, you do too much, you don't have balance in all parts of your life.'</p> <p>Against Ireland in March, we would see the product of some of these qualities. The situation could scarcely have been more dramatic. Having earlier appeared as a substitute against Wales and Italy, Cipriani had been due to make his first start the week before the Ireland match at full-back against Scotland, but was dropped when he was photographed coming out of a Mayfair nightclub on the Wednesday night before the game - he claimed he was just dropping off some tickets. Scotland duly thumped a spineless England 15-9 and Cipriani was recalled by then-coach Brian Ashton, this time to replace Wilkinson at fly-half. The record points scorer in rugby history would watch the Ireland match from the bench, offering an insurance policy in case the 20 year old debutant crumbled.</p> <p>That, of course, never looked like happening. In an enduring image, Cipriani took charge of the pre-game huddle, barking orders at England's much vaunted pack of forwards. 'I couldn't go into playing fly-half for England quietly, because it's just not me,' he explains. 'I didn't want to go in there half-heartedly.' There was little danger of that. Watching the game again, you are reminded of something that his school coach Adrian Norris had said about the 14-year-old Cipriani: often his thought processes were so far out, so advanced that his team-mates would struggle to keep up. But gradually, the angles of his runs and the timing of his passes started to make sense, and he coaxed performances from players, notably Jamie Noon, that were the best of their international careers. He also converted seven place kicks out of seven.</p> <p>When Wilkinson came on, as a replacement at inside centre after 53 minutes, it looked like Cipriani shouted at him, too. 'In some pictures you can make someone look drunk, if their eyes are half-shut,' he says. 'There was no time that I was bossing Jonny around on the pitch.'</p> <p>As the models file out, mwa-mwahing their goodbyes, Cipriani sits down and starts to talk. His voice is soft and polite and his conversation is dominated with goals, purposes, processes, mindsets and structures. He is smart and articulate, certainly, but sometimes he does not even seem to be speaking about sport, or even real life, at all. There is a logic to the occasional mundanity of his analysis: how can you possibly say anything meaningful about something as instinctive and beautiful as the timing of a pass?</p> <p>From the outside, Cipriani's most remarkable quality is his bulletproof self-belief. 'What I like about Danny,' says Lawrence Dallaglio, his team-mate for two seasons at Wasps, 'is that he will do something on the rugby pitch and it won't always work, and everyone will shout at him and say, \"What the hell did you do that for?\" And it will cost him. Then 10 minutes later he will try it again and it will work. He's not put off, his confidence is not damaged by that and that shows as much as you need to know about him.'</p> <p>Case study one: earlier in the 2008 Six Nations, Cipriani was introduced as a replacement for Wilkinson against Italy. One of his first actions was to have a clearance kick charged down, leading to an Italian try and a tense last few minutes before England came through 23-19. So, you come on for a legend of rugby and nearly throw away the game to a team that have never beaten England - how does it feel? 'I remember how I felt and obviously I was gutted,' Cipriani says. 'But the next time I got the ball I hit a 60-metre kick into their 22. That was my process back on to the straight and narrow. You can't worry about it too much, otherwise you are going to get bogged down by mistakes, it's going to be like a snowball effect. So that's why whenever something happens, I just move on.'</p> <p>Lesson one: there is a big difference between making a bad decision and not executing a skill. The Italy game was simply an example of failing to execute a skill properly.</p> <p>Cipriani has obviously been heavily influenced in his approach by Shaun Edwards, the head coach at Wasps and the defensive coach for Wales and provisionally next year's Lions, who tour South Africa. A hero of rugby league, Edwards was a famously redoubtable player - he took part in 33 domestic finals and won every single one - and he has become a formidable presence in rugby union. Once he says something, it stays said. 'I was always taught by a great coach I played under years ago, the biggest risk is not to take one,' he recalls. 'Danny certainly lives by that motto.'</p> <p>Edwards works a lot with Cipriani on leadership qualities, so he was particularly pleased with the manner that he took control against Ireland. 'The forwards don't want a shrinking violet playing No 10,' he says. 'He's a fly-half, he's the guy who controls the game. Those are the kind of guys if they don't have an air of self-confidence around them, there's no doubt that they won't be the player they want to be. Who wants a leader who has no confidence in themselves?'</p> <p>There's confidence and then there's Cipriani. An only child, he was brought up by his mother Anne, who drives a black taxi; Jay, his father, separated from Anne soon after Danny was born and returned to Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Their early years were spent on the Lockyer Estate in Putney, but through scholarships and his mother putting in 'ridiculous hours' in her cab, Cipriani attended some of the best private schools in London. 'I just wanted to be successful,' he recalls. 'My mum worked extremely hard, so that does give you determination.'</p> <p>At school, he was criticised for being a bad loser ('Why would you want to be a good loser?') but, then again, he was not getting beaten too often. 'Some people are good at maths, some people are good at science; I was never good at either of those,' he remembers. 'I just loved being on the sporting field and taking part.'</p> <p>Adrian Norris gives a similar impression of him. 'Was he a prima donna? Would he come down late for training?' he says. 'Far from it. He'd muck in in the changing room. If he was told to pick up the cones, he'd pick up the cones.'</p> <p>While Cipriani's outlandish play has led some observers to see him as flash or arrogant, Dallaglio simply sees him as a product of his environment. 'There's only two rules at Wasps really,' he explains. 'One, you leave your ego at the door; secondly, that you work very honestly and very hard. And if you do those two things then you are going to get on pretty well. With Danny there's a little bit of swagger, a little bit of arrogance, but that is quite readily accepted at Wasps as well, because that is the London way. I always find that people who are predominantly brought up in the bright lights and the big city tend to have a little bit of that because it's what differentiates yourself, because you are what you have been exposed to.'</p> <p>On 18 May, two months after the Ireland game, Cipriani was jackknifed by a tackle from two Bath players and his right ankle was dislocated and fractured. A sickening crack was heard around the ground, soon followed by the player's screams of agony. Everyone immediately knew that the worst had happened: team-mates, fans, Cipriani himself. 'I was running along and my ankle spun,' he remembers. 'My whole body went numb before I did it, so when I looked at my ankle that's when I realised. My brain said, \"That's your ankle. It's in the wrong shape. This is how you are supposed to feel.\" And suddenly the pain kicked in.</p> <p>'The doctor put the ankle back in place on the pitch,' he continues. 'That was probably the most painful thing, because you could feel it twisting in the wrong shape. I was sat there and obviously I was in tears and it was just the fact that I was thinking, \"Is this it? Is this me done?\" All those thoughts go through your head...'</p> <p>Cipriani's voice trails off and it is not hard to imagine how he might have felt. It was the first major injury he had suffered, and it must have been one of the few times in his sporting life where his destiny was out of his own hands. Outstanding natural talents are known to be particularly susceptible to complications coming back from injury - because they find the game so easy, the effort required to rebuild their skills can be difficult to summon. There are examples across British sport, not least Michael Owen, Andrew Flintoff and, most recurringly, Jonny Wilkinson.</p> <p>However, as Cipriani discusses his rehabilitation, he makes it clear that his recovery has not been quite the traumatic experience that he feared. As soon as it happened, Margot Wells sent a text to say, 'I will make you better when you come back,' and she has been true to her word. After two weeks of lying on his back, keeping his ankle raised, he resumed training. Before long, he was working for two-and-a-half hours a day, six days a week. He used the downtime to correct a shoulder problem that had been bothering him last season. When he was not training, he would look for inspiration in videos of sprinting on YouTube - the classic showdowns between Usain Bolt, Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay - or just beat all-comers on Mario Kart Wii</p> <p>Aware that Cipriani can have a short attention span, friends and family made sure that he was scarcely ever without company for the first two months. 'Sometimes I would get worried and say to my friends, \"Do you think I will be the same?\"' he says. 'And they would tell me to shut up and get on with it. Because that's how it is. I know it sounds harsh, but it's the best way to react to it.'</p> <p>How did he feel when England played the All Blacks, another semi-farcical summer tour that led to Test defeats of 37-20 and 44-12? 'I felt like any England fan would and wanted them to win,' he says. 'I didn't wake up at 8am to watch the games, that's a bit too early for me, but I managed to catch the replay. It must have been a tough tour. You need to have players who could lead, and they had those players out there, but it's difficult because New Zealand had been together for a long time. Whereas the England side was very new. A few people said, \"A bit lucky you missed that tour,\" but I don't feel lucky at all.'</p> <p>At some point in his rehab, however, it started to occur to Cipriani that not only would he be back, but he had the opportunity to return better than before. He began to push his coaches and physios to see what else he could improve. 'I think people will be absolutely shocked when they see him play again,' Wells says. 'You never lose talent, and now he's bigger, stronger and faster. I promise you, I time every run and he's quicker than he was before the injury. All the things he said he wanted to be, he is.'</p> <p>It is clear at the photo shoot, when Cipriani removes his shirt to a roomful of sighs, that he has not spent the summer on the sofa. He is - as Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder has it - as shredded as a julienne salad. Shaun Edwards confirms Margot Wells's assessment. 'The fact that he has bulked up quite a bit, I think his tackling is going to be a lot harder this year as well,' he says. 'He's always been a good tackler, but this year he's going to be a destructive tackler.'</p> <p>Lawrence Dallaglio, who experienced the same injury in New Zealand in 2003 and has been keeping a close eye on Cipriani's progress, believes that he might even now have a mental edge. 'In his position, you feel like you have been given a second chance,' he says. 'Subconsciously it gives you a toughness because you have been through something that quite a few of your competitors haven't. For a sportsman it happens to be injury, but for someone else it might be when they lose someone close to them, but adversity makes you stronger. There's absolutely no doubt that Danny will be stronger as a result of it, both mentally and physically, which must be slightly worrying for the competition.'</p> <p>Cipriani nods, 'It's made me get my love back for the game.'</p> <p>Professionalism has been part of rugby since 1995, but it is hard not to see Danny Cipriani at the vanguard of a new movement in the sport. He is certainly in the first wave of players who could watch the game when they were growing up and think of it, in his case, as a viable alternative to playing football or cricket. Cipriani obviously has ambitions that his fame will reach outside the natural constituency of rugby, which might explain why he was photographed naked last year for Cosmopolitan with just a ball covering his 'tackle'. And how many other players with one international start can boast a clothing arrangement with Giorgio Armani?</p> <p>His nascent relationship with model and actress Kelly Brook will certainly help his notoriety, however long it lasts. Cipriani has often talked of rugby players becoming as high-profile as footballers and, for rugby's newest superstar, anything goes as long as you do not damage the credibility of the game. 'You have responsibilities that you have to uphold,' he says. 'Obviously I made a mistake when I went out that night before the Scotland match, but it's not going to happen again, because I've learned from it. It's not going to stop me being a 20-year-old and having fun, but I think there are certain responsibilities that come with it.'</p> <p>Dallaglio, no stranger to controversy himself, is not worried that Cipriani will lose sight of the prize. 'Danny likes a little bit of the showbiz that goes with rugby, but I can tell you one thing: he won't allow any of that to disrupt his career path,' he says. 'He loves rugby too much to let that happen. He's probably learned some pretty harsh lessons already, but he's not shy of it. I've noticed that he's currently dating a young, attractive lady and he's enjoying himself and good luck to him, why not? He's a young, attractive bloke.'</p> <p>Margot Wells agrees. 'Danny strikes a very good balance between work and play,' she says. 'He doesn't go out and get drunk, he lives at home with his mother so he eats very well. I don't know what kind of food The Ivy serves, but he lives a very balanced lifestyle.'</p> <p>You cannot help wondering if Cipriani realises what impact he could have on the popularity of rugby in this country. How many more people would watch England internationals if they were all as dynamic as the Ireland game? Moreover, isn't it a fact, as new team manager Martin Johnson has acknowledged, that the team have to change? None of the southern-hemisphere nations are intimidated by English muscle; even Argentina look just as big and strong; and Wales would fancy their chances against them any day of the week. Put simply, the rest of the world go to the gym as much as England do these days. </p> <p>'I don't think anyone can change a style of play on their own, but when a team gets the right unity and the right alignment, people know about it,' Cipriani says. 'There's not one player who plays for England who wants it to be a slow, kicking game. Everyone wants to play rugby and score tries and do well. It's about getting the structure in place and that's what Martin Johnson is doing.'</p> <p>First he needs to make a successful comeback from injury and his return to the Wasps first team could come as early as the Premiership game at home against Bath on Wednesday 1 October. Eddie Butler sounds a note of caution. 'There's a blind faith attached to Cipriani because he is so unlike the model of the English player,' he says. 'And it comes with a huge burden, because a) everyone he plays against will recognise that and want to smash shit out of him and b) he's a young kid and as far as anyone can tell he has a flaky side to him, whether it be turning up to a nightclub to deliver tickets or trying to be too extravagant or losing concentration at the peak moment or just getting on one of those rolls where he thinks he can do anything. He does not play without flaws.'</p> <p>It may be premature to expect him to return to the side for England's autumn internationals against Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, which take place in November, just after his 21st birthday, but who knows? Like many of sport's greats, he seems to have a good scriptwriter. Anyway, The Jonny &amp; Danny Show is well and truly back on. 'Having Wilkinson and a number of other players vying for that position will keep him incredibly honest,' Dallaglio says. 'It's a position where we have a number of players who can play well, but, to my mind, when he's on his game, even at the age he's at now, he's the stand-out player of his generation.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on October 5 2008. We said England in 1936 were the first of the home nations to beat New Zealand at rugby, but Wales beat them in 1905 and then again in 1935. This has been corrected.</p>",

  "<p>In a tournament packed with memorable football, one of the best moments of Euro 2008 came almost at the very end. Eighty-two minutes into the final, with Spain looking for a second goal to kill off an outclassed Germany, Marcos Senna, the midfield workhorse of the Spanish team, picked up the ball in his own half and started to run with it. He effortlessly took it round one, two, three static Germans before passing out wide to the right. Then he kept running, and the ball kept moving sweetly through the team, until it came back to him, directly in front of goal, for a tap-in. But Senna, who has never scored for Spain, pulled up at the last moment, seemingly shocked to find himself so far upfield. When the ball arrived he was a yard short and, with a desperate lunge, swung at thin air and missed it altogether. It would have been the goal of the tournament, and a fitting climax for Senna, who was seen by many observers as the unsung hero of Spain's success, the man whose hard graft had allowed all the flair players around him to flourish.</p> <p>But something else stood out about the moment. It drew attention to the fact that there was at least one black player in the final. You may not think such a thing worthy of notice at an international tournament in 2008. But Senna was the only black player on the pitch, as he had been during Spain's semi-final against Russia, and the quarter-final against Italy. Germany's squad contained one black player, David Odonkor, but he arrived at the tournament still recovering from surgery to his right knee and his only contribution to the final came when he trotted up dutifully at the end to collect a loser's medal. The Russian and Italian squads had no black players at all. The same was true of the Croatia side that beat Germany in the group stages, and would probably have beaten them again in the semi-finals had they not already been knocked out on penalties by Turkey. Were it not for the Turks and for Marcos Senna, the latter stages of Euro 2008 would have turned into a whites-only affair.</p> <p>What had happened to the glorious example set by France's World Cup-winning team of 1998, with players of different colours combining to beat the equally diverse Brazilians in the final? Les Bleus seemed to point the way forward towards a new era of multi-ethnic, multicultural teams dominating the big international tournaments. But though the French reached the World Cup final again in 2006, they lost there to an all-white Italy, and at times Euro 2008 seemed to come from a period long before 1998, certainly once France had been knocked out in the group stages and Holland had flopped in the quarter-finals. As the tournament went on, there were fewer and fewer non-white faces to be seen either on the pitch or in the stands (it did not help that the event was taking place in Switzerland and Austria, two countries that have struggled more than most to adapt to racial diversity).</p> <p>It also did not help that England were not there. England have not taken an all-white squad to the finals of a major championship since the 1970 World Cup, though this is partly due to failing to make it to some tournaments (England would have had all-white teams at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, had they qualified). This time, the all-white Croatia and Russia teams were there at the expense of a highly talented, racially diverse England side. Part of the problem, as so often in the past, was the manager - the somewhat less talented, extremely white Steve McClaren. The current England team are drawn almost exclusively from the Premier League, the most racially and culturally diverse league in Europe. But there was little of that on display at Euro 2008, either.</p> <p>If this tournament was a showcase for the best of European football, then it was of a very different kind from the Champions League final a month earlier. Nine of Chelsea's 18-man squad for that game were black. Manchester United started with three non-white players, with three more on the bench. It is hard to imagine an all-white team competing against the very best European club sides, who draw their talent from all over the world, regardless of race, creed or colour.</p> <p>Take Zenit St Petersburg, the only club in Europe openly to operate a whites-only transfer policy because, according to their coach, the fans would not accept black players in the team. When the Russian club won the 2007-08 Uefa Cup with a team of only white players, their Dutch coach Dick Advocaat admitted that they had reached the peak of what they could hope to achieve. 'The only players who can make Zenit stronger are dark-skinned,' Advocaat said. 'But for us it would be impossible. I would be happy to sign anyone, but the fans don't like black players.' </p> <p>What Advocaat said was shocking, because of his apparent passivity in the face of the fans' racism, but it was also a statement of the obvious. Football is the ultimate globalised business and any barriers that hold up the free movement of labour are being swept away by the competition to acquire the best players from anywhere they can be found. You cannot expect to compete at the highest level if you are going to be fastidious about who plays for your team. When Zenit paid Dynamo Moscow \u20ac30m this summer for Danny Alves, a 25-year-old midfielder who won his first cap for Portugal only in August, it showed how desperate the search for new talent can become if you rule out black players.</p> <p>Of course national-team football is not the same as club football. Countries can only pick players who qualify as national citizens and this inevitably limits the pool from which they can draw. But it does not need to limit it by much. Marcos Senna, for instance, is not Spanish, or at least not very Spanish. He was born and brought up in Brazil, only moving to Spain in 2002 when he joined Villarreal. Four years later, he acquired Spanish citizenship and was immediately included in Spain's squad for the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>Cynics suggested that Senna had been fast-tracked into the otherwise all-white Spain side as cover for coach Luis Aragon\u00e9s, who had a reputation for less-than-enlightened views on race after he was overheard describing Thierry Henry as a 'black shit'. But Senna was not just there as window-dressing - he was there to strengthen the team. Moreover, according to John Carlin, a long-time observer of Spanish football and of racial politics, Spaniards are not much bothered either by Aragon\u00e9s's slips of the tongue - and Carlin points out that these tend to sound much worse in translation - or by the racial mix of the team. What they want, as all sports fans want, are winners. Senna speaks Spanish with a distinct Brazilian accent, but no one comments, or minds. He belongs to Spain now.</p> <p>Another native Brazilian, had he not been injured, might also have made an impact at Euro 2008. Eduardo, the Arsenal and Croatia centre-forward whose leg had been shattered during a Premier League match in February, might have been the difference between Croatia doing well at Euro 2008 and actually winning it. 'We missed Eduardo,' Slaven Bilic, Croatia's coach, said after his side lost to Turkey. 'Without him, we had problems in finishing.' Eduardo Alves da Silva was born and brought up in Rio de Janeiro, where he was spotted by scouts for Dinamo Zagreb, who brought him to their youth academy as a 16-year-old in 1999. Three years later Eduardo took Croatian citizenship, and two years after that he started playing for the national team. Croatian fans adore him and do not care that he does not look or sound the same as the other players in the team. The view among Croats is that since they found Eduardo and nurtured him, he belongs to them now - if the Brazilians failed to spot his talent, more fool them. Eduardo has returned the compliment by marrying a Croat and happily embracing his new national identity. </p> <p>Croatia's squad at Euro 2008 looked and sounded to the outside world like natural-born Croats. But some of them aren't. Like many of those at the tournament, the players were drawn from all over. Some were born or brought up in Switzerland (Ivan Rakitic, Mladen Petric) or in Germany (Ivan Klasnic, Robert Kovac) and one, Josip Simunic, was born in Australia and trained at the expense of the Australian taxpayer at the Australian Institute of Sport before choosing at the age of 23 to play for Croatia, the country of his parents' birth. Still, the Swiss and the Germans cannot complain. The Switzerland squad had three players of Turkish descent, plus one born in each of Bosnia, Kosovo and Cape Verde. The Germany squad had three players born in Poland (Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski, Piotr Trochowski) as well as the Brazil-born Kevin Kuranji, who could have qualified to play for Brazil, Hungary or Panama before finally opting for Germany. Meanwhile, Germans were very conscious that the Turkey team contained Germany-born players (Hamit Altintop, Hakan Balta) who could just as well have been turning out for them. </p> <p>Focusing on the question of race - where were all the black players? - misses the real story of Euro 2008, which is the relentless breaking down of national boundaries as players (and their parents) move across the globe acquiring multiple national identities along the way. This is where the France team of 1998 may have laid a false trail. Behind the celebration of French success was a kind of inverted racism that often lurks behind celebrations of black success in sport.</p> <p>It is often assumed that teams with a higher proportion of black players will inevitably come to dominate football, as they have other sports, particularly in the United States, because of the greater natural athleticism of black players. This is the thought that often lay unspoken behind the idea that a team from Africa were bound to win the World Cup sooner or later. Once African teams got their act together, so the thinking went, there would be no stopping them. The spectacular success in 1998 of a France side with players from Africa and Caribbean territories such as Guadeloupe seemed to confirm that view. When France went on to win Euro 2000, where Germany, with an all-white team, produced the worst performance at a major tournament in their history (even losing to Kevin Keegan's England), coach Erich Ribbeck was heard to muse in fairly impolitic terms about what had gone wrong. 'We just didn't have the colonies,' he said.</p> <p>Ribbeck was not the only person saying the unsayable at the turn of the century. In 1999 American journalist Jon Entine published Taboo: Why Black Athletes Are Better And Why We're Afraid To Talk About It, which tried to address in non-hysterical terms the rise of black athletes across many sports and any possible connection to biology. Entine drew on statistics from sprinting (at the time he was writing, black athletes held 494 of the top 500 fastest 100metres times), long-distance running, which is disproportionately dominated by Kenyans, and American sports more generally, particularly the NBA, where a racial breakdown that had been 80 per cent white and 20 per cent black during the 1960s had become 85 per cent black by the end of the 1990s. Entine also used football to illustrate his thesis that black players have natural advantages. 'The Netherlands national team,' he wrote, 'which made it to the semi-finals in the '98 World Cup, includes stars from Suriname and is about one-third black. France, the winners, has a large contingent of players of African descent.' He went on: 'As the world playing field continues to level, natural abilities are more likely to come to the fore.' By 'natural abilities', Entine meant the abilities of players who are black.</p> <p>But Entine was wrong, and so was Ribbeck. As football has become a more truly globalised sport, it has not come to be dominated by black players, and it turns out that Germany did not need to have had colonies in order to recover from the humiliations of 2000 (what they needed, among other things, was a better manager). Instead, football has come to be dominated by players whose success is not determined by their skin colour, but by their abilities. Thankfully, football is not like the NBA or the NFL, where affluent whites pay to watch athletic blacks. Football is a sport in which greatness can come from all sorts of surprising places and in which all sorts of skills are valued. Who are the greatest football players of the modern era, the top five never mind the top 500? Perhaps Pel\u00e9, Cruyff, Maradona, Zidane, Ronaldo (the black one, not the white one). What have racial stereotypes got to do with that list, except to be mocked by it? Even now, if asked to pick a world XI to take on all-comers, it would be possible to come up with a convincing team consisting entirely of white players (maybe with Torres and Rooney up front, two of the whitest men on the planet), and an equally plausible team of black players (perhaps with Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o leading the line). Football is the world's favourite sport in part because it is a sport that can truly transcend racial differences.</p> <p>Kevin Hylton, the author of a new book, 'Race' and Sport: Critical Race Theory, says that it is all too easy to view sport through outdated and naive racial categories, what he calls 'the binary and static categories of black and white'. We need to get beyond this, he says, and see 'just how dynamic and diverse racial and cultural identities can be'. International football increasingly helps to illustrate this, in ways that Entine entirely missed because he was seeing everything through the prism of American sport, where racial identities are invariably reinforced through sport (basketball is a 'black' sport, as ice hockey is a 'white' sport) rather than being broken down by it.</p> <p>It is true that the division is not always black versus white. Before basketball became a black sport, it was seen as a predominantly Jewish sport, because it was the game impoverished Jews invariably chose as a way out of the ghetto. But this socio-cultural explanation did not stop many commentators looking for a biological explanation. 'The reason I suspect that basketball appeals to the Hebrew with his Oriental background,' a writer for the New York Daily News opined in the 1930s, 'is that the game places a premium on an alert, scheming mind, flashy trickiness, artful dodging and general smart aleckness.' It is worth remembering this when commentators say today that blacks dominate basketball because it is a game that values speed and the ability to jump.</p> <p>It is one of the minor tragedies of American history that the country never properly embraced 'soccer', a sport that might have been best equipped to cut across some of the static and binary racial divisions of American society. When Jon Entine published Taboo, he agreed to take part in a discussion with the Reverend Jesse Jackson on CNN. This was brave of him, and the exchange was not a happy one. Jackson was furious with Entine for reinforcing racial prejudice rather than looking at all the social forces that combine to distort the level playing field of sport. For Jackson, basketball was a sport that did not so much favour black athletes as pigeonhole them. </p> <p>Entine accepted that cultural factors play a large part in determining which sports attract which sorts of athletes, but insisted that to turn a blind eye to the biological differences was simply to ignore the facts. He also acknowledged that it was a mistake to reduce everything to the simple binary of black versus white - the black athletes who dominate sprinting, for example, are of West African descent, whereas the long-distance runners are invariably East African. 'I don't believe in the concept of race, Reverend Jackson,' Entine insisted, 'and I don't think blacks can be lumped into one population because of skin colour.' </p> <p>But Jackson was having none of it. 'The one thing I'm convinced of,' he declared by way of conclusion, 'is whenever the playing field is even, the rules are public, the goals are clear, and there is a work ethic, we all do exceptionally well.'</p> <p>What Jackson needed to prove his case was the example of football, where what he says is demonstrably true. Of course, football has had more than its share of racism and stereotyping blighting the chances of players from different ethnic backgrounds, but when the playing field is even, then anyone can succeed. Kevin Hylton's book has on its cover one of the most famous of all football photographs, the embrace between Pel\u00e9 and Bobby Moore after the Brazil v England game at the 1970 World Cup. Both men are stripped to the waist, both smiling, both displaying an obvious mutual respect. They have different physiques, Pel\u00e9 shorter and more muscular, the blond and pale-skinned Moore taller, skinnier, slightly less athletic-looking. 'I had serious doubts about putting this picture on the cover,' Hylton tells me. 'It's the ultimate binary image, black against white. Also I don't want people to forget the racism that Pel\u00e9 suffered throughout his career, from inside Brazil as well as from the outside world.' Still, it is a wonderful photograph, because of what it says about the scope football provides for players of different types to excel, and to compete on equal terms. There is a similarly celebrated basketball photo from the late 1980s, which shows the black Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and the white Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics facing each other, cautiously but with mutual respect, as befits the two premier players of their era. But that photo seems to come from another age, and to mark the passing of basketball from an era in which one type of player could excel to an era that would favour another. Jordan versus Bird seems to belong to the past, whereas Pel\u00e9 versus Moore is a timeless confrontation in football terms.</p> <p>The peerless Brazil team of 1970 contained players of every different shade of skin. But it also symbolised the racism that lurks in the background of all sports, including football, including in Brazil. The goalkeeper of that team - F\u00e9lix - was white, because Brazil did not pick black goalkeepers, a result of prejudices that lingered on from the disaster of the 1950 World Cup final, which Brazil lost unexpectedly to Uruguay. As David Goldblatt writes in his magnificent history of global football, The Ball Is Round: 'When the time for recriminations did come, the scapegoats were the left-half Bigode, defender Juvenal and goalkeeper Barbosa. All were condemned in the press as cowards, lacking fibre and discipline - and all three were black. Barbosa was singled out for special levels of opprobrium which endured until his poverty-stricken death 50 years later.' Brazil did not pick a black goalkeeper until Dida in 1995. As Goldblatt says of 1950: 'The multiracial, confident, progressive Brazil that [had been] conjured from football was dissolved in an acid bath of racism, self-doubt and self-loathing.'</p> <p>Skin colour matters in football not because of what it says about the abilities of the players, but because of what it can say about the distorted perspectives of people who do not play the game but merely watch it, or administer it, or finance it. Some countries have started looking to Africa to bolster their national teams by encouraging players to change nationality in return for the greater rewards on offer. This is not because African players are naturally better. It is because African players are often more vulnerable to these sorts of offers, and more easily exploited by anyone willing to be unscrupulous about whom they recruit.</p> <p>Tom Vernon, the Manchester United scout in Africa and founder of the Right To Dream football academy in Ghana, says 'the continent is currently being swept for talent' by some national federations looking to naturalise promising young players. The most conspicuous example of this is Qatar, whose Aspire academy has a large budget devoted to hosting trials in every country in Africa with a view to offering the resources of the Qatari Football Federation to the best they can find, and with the prospect of Qatari citizenship included. The attractions of this arrangement for young African players are obvious, particularly when they come from impoverished countries that lack a clear national identity in football terms, or are held back by a corrupt national federation in the country of their birth. 'Still,' Vernon says, 'it's outrageous what's going on.' The ultimate aim of the Qataris is to have a properly competitive team at the 2014 World Cup, though what that will mean in practice is a team that is almost entirely of African origin, with little or no connection to Qatar itself beyond what the Aspire academy has given them. </p> <p>But it is not just the Qataris - other countries have started to fast-track the naturalisation of African players, including some of the smaller European nations. The main motivation here tends to come from big European club sides, particularly in England, who want African players with European Union passports in order to get round potential problems with work permits. The easiest way to do this is to farm the players out to feeder clubs in Benelux or Scandinavian countries, where they can acquire a passport after a brief period of residency, and then be available to move to the UK. But, as Vernon says: 'This also provides a chance for these countries to transform the make-up of their national teams. In some ways, places like Luxembourg are missing an opportunity here.' But if they take that opportunity, they risk a backlash from their own fans, never mind those of other countries, including the African countries of origin of their new players, given the mockery this would make of the idea of belonging to a national team.</p> <p>When it works well, as it has in the cases of Marcos Senna and Eduardo, the naturalisation of overseas players can be a force for good, breaking down prejudices and broadening horizons. But it needs to be handled carefully. The Poles have a record of fast-tracking foreigners into the national team - they did it with Nigeria-born Emmanuel Olisadebe before qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, and they did it again before Euro 2008, with Brazil-born Roger Guerreiro transformed into a Pole just two months before the finals, having only been in the country since 2006. Not only did this smack of desperation, but it stirred up nationalist sentiment in a country where race relations are fragile at best. The racism of some fans should not be a reason for holding back when selecting the best players to turn out for Poland, any more than it should hold back Zenit St Peterburg in the transfer market, but clumsy attempts to play the system can help to generate intolerance instead of overcoming it.</p> <p>What is important, though, is to see that this is not about race, whatever the racists may like to think. It is about the changing face of national identity. The next World Cup will take place in South Africa in 2010. It is not inconceivable that the final could be contested by an all-white European team and an all-black African one. That could appear, in South Africa of all places, to be a retrograde step. But it need be nothing of the sort. It would be a sign that good football teams can be any colour. If an African side do finally win the tournament in 2010, it will not be because Africans are naturally more talented, but simply because the rest of the world have finally allowed the African continent home advantage, the single most important factor in determining the winner of World Cups. </p> <p>Moreover, as Kevin Hylton says, 'we need to look beyond \"whiteness\" and \"blackness\" to see all the diversity that lies behind those static categories'. All-black African teams are no more homogenous than all-white European ones. Players move, their parents move, and countries often naturalise players born or brought up elsewhere. 'West Africa is not so different from Europe,' Tom Vernon says. The boundaries between some of the strongest African teams - Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Cameroon - can be as fluid as they are in Europe when it comes to player registration and the best sides are often the ones that draw on the widest pool of talent.</p> <p>What about England? To qualify for 2010, England need to emerge from a group with Croatia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Andorra. The England team are long used to suffering racial abuse in eastern Europe and this group looks pretty ominous in that respect - Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have never fielded a black player between them. During the team's 4-1 win in Zagreb in early September, Emile Heskey was targeted by some in the crowd - with Eduardo out injured, things may be slipping back in Croatia. </p> <p>England have always led the way in fielding multiracial teams - ever since Viv Anderson was first picked in 1978 - but, in some other respects, they are starting to be left behind. Other major European national teams are looking to register players with multiple nationalities as young as possible in their national federations. The Polish FA are trawling German youth teams for possible Poland players of the future. The Germans, realising what they have missed out on, are now actively recruiting among the Turkish community. In Spain, a battle has long been under way for one of the world's most talented teenagers, Barcelona's Bojan Krkic, son of a Serbian footballer and a Spanish nurse. Krkic is a product of the Barcelona youth system that also developed Lionel Messi, a player many Spaniards wish they had claimed as their own after he moved from Argentina at the age of 13.</p> <p>The big English clubs are not in the habit of searching the world for young talent to train up in Britain; instead, they buy in established players from abroad, whose national affiliation is invariably already fixed. So the national team have fewer opportunities to look outside home-grown communities for future England players. But the new influx of immigrants from eastern Europe means that, too, may be about the change. Will the English FA also soon be in competition with the Polish FA to secure talented teenagers born there but brought up here? Like everyone else, the England team are going to have to try to broaden their talent base in any way they can. The current England team member who probably best reflects the sort of diversity we should get used to in the future is Owen Hargreaves, who was born in Canada to a Welsh mother and an English father, and moved to Germany with Bayern Munich at the age of 16, where he remained until his transfer to Manchester United last year. Hargreaves is white, but he is a lot less English than any of the non-white players who have appeared for England over the past 30 years. Almost nothing about the future of international football is simply black and white any more. </p> <h2>Double Identities: The teams they could have played for</h2> <p><strong>Manuel Almunia</strong> Spain and England </p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa </strong>DR Congo and Portugal</p> <p><strong>Jean-Alain Boumsong</strong> Cameroon and France</p> <p><strong>Philippe Senderos</strong> Spain, Serbia and Switzerland</p> <p><strong>Patrice Evra</strong> Senegal and France</p> <p><strong>Colin Kazim-Richards</strong> England and Turkey</p> <p><strong>Patrick Vieira</strong> Cape Verde, Senegal and France</p> <p><strong>Owen Hargreaves </strong>Wales, Canada, England and Germany</p> <p><strong>Gabriel Agbonlahor</strong> England, Nigeria and Scotland</p> <p><strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong> Bosnia, Croatia and Sweden</p> <p><strong>Kevin Kuranyi</strong> Brazil, Panama, Hungary and Germany</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Runciman's essay on 'Home Advantage' appeared in February's OSM</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Ireland has just picked up Manchester City's player-of-the-month award, something few outsiders would have predicted in a month that brought Robinho to Eastlands for a record sum and had the club's new owners bragging about bringing in Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc F\u00e1bregas as well. </p> <p>Regular City watchers will not have been too surprised. Ireland was given a standing ovation when substituted last week against Portsmouth, and it all but went over his newly shaved head. 'I was gutted,' he claims. 'I hate coming off early.' When Sven-Goran Eriksson came to the club with another blizzard of Brazilian signings, he identified Didi Hamann and Ireland as the two best players already on the books, and the 22-year-old Irishman has upped his game since then. </p> <p>'I've had to,' he explains. 'That's what's so good about the club going out and bringing in world-class players, it forces everyone else to improve. I've always tried to work on my consistency and being surrounded by great players is a help. I know I have to be on top of my game, because if I was to get dropped now I might be out for six or seven matches.' </p> <p>The other thing that has spurred on Ireland this season was not being sold to Sunderland. Roy Keane was ready to buy a player who followed him through the Cobh Ramblers ranks, though Mark Hughes was not willing to sell. What was originally billed as a bust-up between the new City manager and the attacking midfielder who was unintentionally late for a pre-season game turned out to be Hughes laying the law down in a different way. 'The Sunderland business was blown out of all proportion,' Ireland says. 'This is where I want to be, where I need to be to be honest, but I didn't know how much the manager wanted to keep me. Mark Hughes told me I would not be leaving while he had any say in the matter, and that did a lot for me, knowing he valued me so highly.' </p> <p>Indeed, Hughes could hardly have realised how powerfully his message would come across. Ireland might have been expected to lean towards a fellow Irishman and former Rambler in any contest between the two, yet it turns out that Hughes was a far bigger career influence all along. 'I didn't follow Roy Keane's career as much as I followed Mark Hughes's,' Ireland says. 'He was awesome as a player, but I thought he did a great job as Blackburn manager as well. I was really excited when I found out he was coming here, and I haven't been disappointed. He's really, really strong, knows what he wants, and communicates it well. He doesn't always say a lot, but when he does you listen. It's not just what he says, either. </p> <p>'The training ground has changed a lot since he arrived, it's so much more professional now, so much more fair to everyone. I didn't have a problem with Sven, but it wasn't like this when he was here. It was more wild, less controlled, and morale would go up and down each week according to results. I'm not saying we had a wild time under Sven, that's not what I mean, but last season it was turn up, boots on, train, boots off, go home. When we faded after Christmas we couldn't turn it round. We get more instruction now, more individual assistance. The gaffer tells us exactly what he wants us to do yet at the same time it is so much more relaxed, the club is much more like a family again.' </p> <p>Family is important to Ireland, as even a cursory study of his history will establish. He is famous, if not notorious, for the embarrassment he brought on himself when concocting a far from foolproof excuse to get out of a Republic of Ireland trip a year ago, yet all that lay behind the grandmother fib was a simple desire to be back home with his girlfriend and children. He has not been selected for Ireland since and is quite happy about it. 'I'm unsure about the situation there, for my part I'll never say never, but to be honest I don't miss it,' he says. 'I'm happy doing what I'm doing right now. I've got three young children and my commitments at the moment are to my club and my family. International football takes you away from home, and at the moment I feel I'm better off being away from it. I enjoy my life at the moment and I don't really want to change it, though as I say you should never say never.' </p> <p>A family ethos at the club was why Ireland chose City in the first place. He had trials with several Premier League clubs including Manchester United as a 15-year-old, but was most impressed by the welcome City put out and the personal touch Kevin Keegan supplied. 'I felt City was the best option by far,' he explains. 'They seemed to know exactly what I was looking for.' </p> <p>If that was a family feeling, City provided it. If it was family-type security and stability, he might have been better off across the city. United have had one manager in all his time in England. Ireland is already on his fourth. Perhaps that is why he invests so much faith in Hughes, because he feels he will be sticking around. He is impressed with the new owners too, and dismissive of claims they will spend all their money on star names and ignore the good work being done by the club's academy. 'As far as I know they are talking about expanding the academy,' he says. 'They have had a look at it and been impressed, and it would be shame to spoil what has already been put in place. </p> <p>'I think all the talk of F\u00e1bregas and others is mostly speculation anyway. The squad is strong and if we are in a good position at Christmas we might need a couple of players to give us an extra edge. We didn't have that last year. But it's all up to Mark Hughes. The best thing the owners have said is that they are going to let him do his thing without interference. I hope so, because from the players' point of view things are almost perfect right now. You even notice an excitement in training. We can't wait for the weekends to come around.' </p> <p>It is only fair to remind Ireland at this point, before he gets too carried away, that City did not look all that clever at Brighton in midweek in the Carling Cup. 'The manager wasn't happy about that performance and he told us so,' he counters. 'But the great thing from our point of view is that we've got the opportunity to put things right at Wigan.'</p> <p>After putting six past Portsmouth almost anything seems possible at the JJB Stadium this afternoon. Wigan have a decent Premier League record against the old City, but Titus Bramble must be having nightmares about facing Robinho. Ireland is still pinching himself about playing alongside him. 'I was shocked when I heard the news,' he admits. 'Excited, obviously, because I've always been a big fan of his, but when I saw the transfer had happened it was a shock. He's great to play with though, because when you give him the ball you can trust him with it. He won't lose it or waste it and he's got a final product as well.' </p> <p>Talking of which, Ireland has a final product of his own he is still planning to use when the occasion is right. The Superman underpants he displayed by dropping his shorts on scoring against Sunderland last season could fly again, despite an FA warning last time. 'I gave the originals to a charity but I've still got a pair, in fact I've bought some even better ones since,' he says. 'I didn't really plan it the first time, I'd just been wearing the Superman pants for luck under my shorts and of course the lads in the dressing room had seen them and started taking the mickey. I said I'd show them if I ever scored, for a joke. Then when I did score, Martin Petrov was right by my side saying, \"Come on then\" so I did. If I do it again I'll probably get into trouble, but if I score on a really big occasion I don't think anything will hold me back.' </p> <p>He might have been on safe ground there with the old City, who were not exactly on intimate terms with really big occasions, but nowadays who knows? FA Cup final, Champions League, anything may be possible. Where does Ireland think City could be by the end of the season? 'I think we can aim for fourth place,' he says. 'It could be between us and Aston Villa.'</p>",
  "<p>Theo Walcott, Rebecca Adlington, Tom Daley, Laura Robson, Louis Smith - this year's list of stellar sporting achievers has a distinctly teenage theme. In the past 10 days alone 14-year-old Olympian diver Daley has won two junior world championship silver medals, while Robson won three matches on her way to the semi-finals of her first professional British tennis tournament. Adlington is the bookies' red-hot favourite to win this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, and even the junior award looks likely to be one hell of a contest. </p> <p>'They are coming through earlier than ever before, and with a higher profile. Certainly in my time I haven't seen anything like it,' says BBC director of sport Roger Mosey. </p> <p>As much as sports governing bodies will want to take the plaudits, this has to be an occasion where parents take the headlines. Ask young sports stars how they have achieved so much and they will relay stories of parents ferrying them to training and back, making sacrifices in their personal lives, working hard to support them, and in some cases - such as Walcott's father Don and Adlington's mother Kay - even giving up their jobs. </p> <p>Don Walcott famously quit his job with British Gas when his employers refused to give him time off to watch Theo's professional debut for Southampton in 2005. He had not missed any of his son's matches before then and was darned if he was going to miss this one. The family were forced to rely on the single earnings of Theo's mum Lynn, a midwife, but when Theo scored that night, his dad said it was the best decision he had ever made. </p> <p>Adlington's mum had to give up her job when Becky, aged 13, began training with coach Bill Furniss in Nottingham, 25 miles from their home in the east midlands town of Mansfield. 'It was a really tough time for us,' says Kay, 'My husband's business was struggling, and all three of our girls were on different swim teams. Managing it all was like a military operation. Driving Becky to the pool at 5am, watching her train, taking her home, then to school, then back to training, was a full-time job in itself and I was still doing the payroll for my husband's business.' </p> <p>Being driven by mum is something familiar to another teenaged star, gymnast Louis Smith, 19, who won bronze on the pommel horse in Beijing. 'She gave me lifts at all hours every day to the gym so I could train and she made sure that she had enough money to help me out with little things when I was totally broke. She has been my inspiration. Without her, I would not be here,' Smith said of his mother, Elaine, recently</p> <p>There are plenty of sacrifices to be made, but the Adlingtons would not let their daughters' swimming be one of them. 'Steve and I come from working-class backgrounds. When you've had nothing you learn to go without, you think, \"Ok we won't go out for meals, we'll spend that money on the girls.\" We didn't have much of a social life, but after all those early mornings you wouldn't want to go out on a Saturday night anyway.'</p> <p>Adlington proved adept at swimming aged four, when she jumped into a pool on holiday despite never having swum before. 'We just froze and held our breath, but she came back up and swam to the side. We looked at each other and said, \"This girl needs swimming lessons\".'</p> <p>The family got involved with their local pool, Sherwood Colliery Swimming Club, now to be renamed after Adlington. All three girls swam there and Kay worked there as an assistant coach teaching young children. 'It was something we did as a family. It was a nice environment and Becky loved it, she was always happiest in the pool.' Aged 12, Becky cleaned up at the national championships and the family then realised she had potential. Still they never pushed her. </p> <p>'From the beginning we said to our daughters, \"The minute you stop enjoying swimming you stop.\" A lot of people think we must be obsessed for Becky to have achieved what she has, but we're not. Becky just loves it. Someone said to me, \"You've got her where she is.\" I got annoyed with that because I haven't got her anywhere, I drove her to training but she got in the pool and achieved it herself. We've just been the team behind her.'</p> <p>It is a common assumption that any young sporting achiever must have 'pushy parents'; the more precocious the talent the more the suspicion is piled on. Sitting in their kitchen in Plymouth, mum Debbie and dad Rob are well used to such inferences. 'People probably think all sorts of things,' says Rob, 'that we're right stuck up, or rich to the back teeth, but we're just normal people.' </p> <p>'Someone said about us being pushy parents because Rob videos Tom's competitions,' says Debbie. 'But if your child was in a school play you'd record them, wouldn't you? We don't video it and play it back to Tom saying, \"This is where you went wrong...\" It's just a nice record.</p> <p>'I would say Tom's a pushy athlete, he's the one stood at the door with his rucksack saying, \"Come on, we're gonna be late.\" I don't know where he gets that from, Rob's always late. We were due to get married at 1.15pm and he didn't get in the shower until ten to one.'</p> <p>The media interest in young sports stars is one of the more difficult challenges for the parents. From hysteria to criticism, there is a wide spectrum of opinion. When Robson, 14, won the Wimbledon junior title this summer, the bookies were immediately calculating odds on her winning the senior competition next year. Similarly, observers began carping on about a fall from grace before she had even turned professional. The response from Laura's agent has been to protect her and her family, turning down interview requests, concerned about the hype. </p> <p>At times it must feel like a no-win situation. In Beijing Tom Daley was criticised for naming sponsors at his press conference, something that shocked his parents. 'We've always taught him to be polite,' says Rob. 'He was just thanking them for making the trip nicer, it was common courtesy - they're not even his sponsors.' He sighs. 'Some people just see pound signs. I've always told Tom not to listen to the rubbish people come out with.'</p> <p>In the garage is Tom's 'scrapbook', a library of all his newspaper cuttings meticulously collated by Rob. The coverage has increased markedly; May 2008 fills a whole thick file, goodness knows how many he will need for August. 'Tom probably thinks I'm a nutter,' says Rob, 'but when he's older he might like to look back on things.' For now Tom is refreshingly uninterested. 'I don't like to read about myself,' he says, 'I find it weird. I think of other people being in the paper, not me.' </p> <p>Still, he has had to get used to fame, being stopped in the street for photographs, receiving letters from around the world. Many are addressed simply as, 'Tom Daley, Olympian, Plymouth'. 'It's like Father Christmas,' says Debbie. </p> <p>He has developed a fine autograph. 'Yeah, Tonia Couch [training partner] designed it for me,' says Tom. 'She said, \"Oi you're going to have to learn autographs,\" and I was like well I don't know how. That was a few years ago, messing around. So she made me one, then I actually ended up needing to use it.' He pulls a face, as though the world has gone crazy. </p> <p>Do Tom's parents worry about how much media attention has been generated? 'Not particularly,' says Debbie. 'A lot of it you can control, you can say no. Tom's always had good reviews anyway apart from all the hassle with Blake [Aldridge], but that was more about Blake than Tom, although I'm sure there'll be a day when there are [negative] things written about him.'</p> <p>'I always work on the ethic that you be good to the media and they'll have no reason to turn against you,' says Rob. 'The day they do, that'll be the end of talking to that newspaper. Still, I'm fully aware of what some newspapers can do. We have turned down offers of money for all sorts. Generally it's common sense. I ran a business for many years and I can suss people out.'</p> <p>While the Daleys are used to media interest - Tom's first appearance on TV came when he was 10 - for the Adlingtons the attention was a shock. 'We didn't handle it very well,' says Kay, 'we didn't know how to. After Becky's first gold medal so many people were ringing the house - 11 satellite trucks turned up outside. My daughter Laura counted eight television crews queuing in our hallway, the first turned up at 6.45 in the morning and the last one left just before 10 at night. And then they came again the next day. We were out of our depth. We hadn't eaten, it was too much. We were still trying to take in Becky's achievements. </p> <p>'Even now when I think about it, it's scary that Becky's being mentioned in the same bracket as Theo Walcott. I mean footballers are internationally known. In all honesty you don't think about your own daughter like that. To us she's just Becky, the same girl who loves chocolate cake, shoes, old-fashioned sweets and curling up on the sofa to watch a DVD.'</p> <p>Unprepared for the media onslaught, the Adlingtons wished they could have had some advice. 'We should have said, \"Do you mind if we have a break?\" but we didn't feel we could. Who are we? I'm just a mum who's taken her daughter swimming. Now I walk round Tesco's and everyone knows who I am. Eventually we learned to say no, but it ought to change. There should be advice and support for the families. If someone gave us a ring and said, \"This is what's going to happen, prepare for it,\" it would have helped. For 2012 we need to train our young people to win medals, but also to deal with what happens afterwards.'</p> <p>The Adlingtons and the Daleys agree that maintaining a 'normal' family life has been important. Becky missed out on parties and night-clubbing as a teenager but her parents made sure her friends came over for DVDs and pizza. There is also an emphasis on looking after all of their children; while Rob Daley brings Tom to the pool six days a week, Debbie takes their younger sons, Will and Ben, to rugby and football, and the whole family watch all three of their sons play sport. </p> <p>Anyone who wonders whether Tom is prematurely bypassing childhood has only to spend five minutes in the Daley house. The three boys play 'Rockband' together in the front room, and while eating dinner they push their cottage pie around their plates,. Tom gets excited about sending Dip Dabs to his diving friends in America. 'They tried them and they were like, \"Oh my god, these are yummy.\" They're sending me some surprise American sweets back.'</p> <p>For both families, life-threatening illness brought them closer together - Rob had a tumour in his brain removed in May 2006, while Laura, the middle daughter, was on a life support machine after glandular fever infected her brain four years ago. Becky also had the disease, though in a milder form. The family were rocked by the episode. 'It was an agonising time,' says Kay, 'Becky seeing her sister in intensive care, fighting for her life, she must have asked herself the question, \"Will it do this to me?\" On the advice of her coach she kept up gentle training, and we monitored her closely for any change in mood, or appetite. While we sat in the hospital Chloe, the eldest, took Becky training. The whole family chipped in.'</p> <p>The family values of the Adlingtons are clear. Sporting victories, sponsorship deals and parental pride are all very nice, but the family bond comes first. 'We learned a lot from that time,' says Kay. 'It's all too easy to be materialistic, wanting nice shoes - in Becky's case - or medals, but family really is the most important thing.' </p> <p>Therein lies the secret to well-balanced individuals, and the added bonus of sporting success.</p>",
  "<p>Durham have won their maiden County Championship title only 16 years after their inaugural first-class match. They sneaked the LV Division One silverware ahead of Nottinghamshire, who were strong favourites at the start of the final round of matches but lost their home game against Hampshire - while Durham beat Kent by an innings and 71 runs at Canterbury.</p> <p>Kent, battling against an odds-on likelihood of relegation, managed to take the contest into the final day at the St Lawrence Ground thanks to a century stand for the sixth wicket between Justin Kemp and Ryan McLaren. But once the two South Africans' resistance was broken, Durham knew they were closing on victory. When Notts' result was finally confirmed, they could begin their celebrations properly - having won the title by eight points. </p> <p>Nottinghamshire failed in their improbable final-day bid after losing to Hampshire by 203 runs at Trent Bridge. Although Chris Read's side went into the final round of matches with a healthy 10-point advantage over Durham they failed to recover from a first-innings batting implosion on the second day.</p> <p>Set a massive 442-run target in two and a half sessions to claim their second Division One crown in four years, Nottinghamshire went down swinging but Samit Patel's 77 and Bilal Shafayat's 48, together with an unbeaten 47 from Chris Read were in vain as the home side were all out for 238. Dimitri Mascarenhas and Imran Tahir claimed four wickets each for the visitors.</p> <p>Mark Chilton fell just short of a century as Lancashire, who have secured their LV County Championship Division One status for next season, recorded a comfortable eight-wicket victory over Somerset at Taunton. Somerset had gone into the game with title aspirations but those were not fulfilled. Paul Horton (57) and Chilton (97) took the visitors close to victory but it was left to Stuart Law and Kevin Brown to see Lancashire home.</p> <p>Sussex and Yorkshire escaped relegation after securing a draw at Hove as Murray Goodwin scored his sixth first-class hundred of the year. The hosts ended on 397 for nine, a lead of 204, when stumps were called an hour before the scheduled close of play, with a positive result unlikely.</p> <p>Warwickshire stormed to their first home win in the LV County Championship for 17 months after a spectacular collapse by Glamorgan at Edgbaston. Having drawn all seven home fixtures, the Division Two champions took nine wickets in two hours to complete their first victory in Birmingham since beating Sussex by an innings and 34 runs in April 2007. Glamorgan resumed on 122 for one, needing a further 281 to spoil Warwickshire's unbeaten record for the season, but lost seven wickets for six runs in 48 balls and crashed to defeat by 179 runs. </p> <p>Australian-born seamer Dirk Nannes ensured Middlesex's turbulent season ended on a high as they dampened a Northamptonshire revival to claim a 93-run victory at Wantage Road. The 32-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements with the ball in the first innings but proved to be the hero picking up four for 42 as Middlesex bowled Northants out for 367. </p> <p>Former England spinner Shaun Udal also got in on the act, claiming three for 96 to add to his first innings five-wicket haul but Northants refused to go down with a whimper. Rob White made sure it was a nervy final day for the visitors as they began to chase down 461, smashing a quickfire 123 while Riki Wessels followed his lead by chipping in with 95. However, White and Wessels' resilience proved to be too little too late as Nannes and Udal combined late on to leave Northants winless since July.</p>",
  "<p>The actor Paul Newman, who has died aged 83, became so famous for his dazzling looks, and the bluest eyes in the business, that it is impossible to think of him as other than a celebrity. </p> <p>Yet his many faceted, contradictory character renders the star image superficial. He was also a notable producer-director, a racing car enthusiast, a political activist and a philanthropist, counted as the person who had distributed more money - in relation to his own wealth - than any other American during the 20th century.</p> <p>He claimed to be happiest behind the wheel of a racing car and noted that his athleticism found its perfect outlet in this sport. As a producer and co-founder of several companies, he was responsible for many of his own films and directed six features, four of them starring his second wife, Joanne Woodward. One of these gained him an Oscar nomination \u2014 one of eight, although he waited until 1986 for the coveted best actor statuette. He received two other Academy Awards, an oddly premature lifetime achievement award in 1985 and the Jean Herscholt award for his philanthropic work in 1993.</p> <p>It is possible that this work may outlive his other achievements. In 1982 he founded - initially as a modest venture - the company Newman's Own, producing products such as pasta sauces based on his own home recipes. He devoted the company's entire profits - around $250m to date - to causes throughout the world.</p> <p>Newman was actively concerned with some of the projects, including the Hole in the Wall Gang summer camps, devoted to underprivileged youngsters. He never gave up social concerns, and, in 1999, returned to the theatre in the two-hander Love Letters, where he and his wife raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help land conservation in Connecticut.</p> <p>He found time for political activities, including donating $1m to the leftist magazine The Nation, long-term involvement in civil rights issues and support for Democratic candidates. That said, his fame inevitably rested on his screen career. The star of more than 50 features, including 11 opposite Woodward, Newman, with his blue eyes, insouciant smile, and a handsome and eternally slim figure, was the idol of countless fans. His characters, such as the leads in Hud (1963) and Cool Hand Luke (1967) made him internationally famous and allowed him to enjoy the comfortable, although unostentatious, lifestyle available only to the very rich, with a main home in Connecticut, a Manhattan penthouse and a base in California.</p> <p>Newman was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, the younger son of a sports store owner. His father was of Jewish-German descent and his mother was a Catholic whose family came from Hungary. She became a Christian Scientist when Paul was just five but her new beliefs did not impinge on the family and later in life Newman chose to follow none of their beliefs but, when asked, opted \"for Jewishness because I considered it more challenging\".</p> <p>His acting debut, aged seven, was as the court jester in Robin Hood at school. He left Shaker Heights high school in 1943 and went on briefly to Ohio University, in Athens, where he was expelled, supposedly after an incident involving a keg of beer and the rector's car. </p> <p>His comfortable life and good looks were proving a mixed blessing and wayward behaviour ended in trouble for drunkenness; there were even a couple of very brief stints behind bars. He had a lifelong liking for practical jokes.</p> <p>From 1943 to 1946 Newman served as a US navy torpedo bomber radio operator. He graduated from the liberal arts Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, in 1949 and that year married for the first time \u2014 to Jacqueline Witte \u2014 and returned to Cleveland to manage the family store. His father died in 1950. But his destiny was to be an actor and he and his wife and son moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where Newman attended Yale Drama School. He had ambitions to be a drama teacher, but he was spotted at Yale by New York agents, moved to New York and had a period at the Actors' Studio. He did a lot of television in that decade, debuting in an episode of the science fiction series Tales of Tomorrow in 1952. More importantly, chance led to a highly successful Broadway debut, originally as an understudy, in William Inge's play Picnic (1953-54) \u2014 where he met another understudy, Woodward.</p> <p>By then Hollywood had beckoned, but its call came via one of the most calamitous screen debuts ever recorded. The Silver Chalice (1954) miscast him in a toga, and so dismayed him that years later he paid for advertisements urging viewers not to watch it on television. He learned one valuable lesson \u2014 \"avoid frocks\" \u2014 and concentrated (except for westerns) on modern characters, often those under stress. There were few conventional romantic roles or comedies.</p> <p>Recovery from his disastrous movie debut came back on Broadway in 1955, playing a gangster in The Desperate Hours. There was also plenty of television, including The Battler (1955), a Hemingway adaptation, directed by Arthur Penn, with Newman as a brain-damaged boxer, and a baseball story, Bang the Drum Slowly (1956).</p> <p>Back in Hollywood he had famously lost out to James Dean when Elia Kazan screen tested them both for the lead in East of Eden. But in 1956, following Dean's death, the role of the boxer Rocky Graziano \u2014 earmarked for Dean \u2014 in Somebody Up There Likes Me fell to him. That year, too, he starred as a brainwashed army officer in the post-Korean war drama, The Rack. Even the couple of duds which followed could not take the shine off his success. In 1957 Newman filmed The Long Hot Summer (1958), from a William Faulkner story, alongside Woodward. By January 1958 Newman was divorced from Witte, and had married his co-star.</p> <p>Two more films that year confirmed his stardom. The Left Handed Gun featured Newman as Billy the Kid. They play on which it was based, written by Gore Vidal \u2014 a close friend of Newman and Woodward \u2014 had depicted Billy as gay. This theme became less explicit as the work filtered through TV, where Newman had first performed it in 1955, and in to Arthur Penn's screen version where Billy's relationship with his murdered mentor is left unclear.</p> <p>The same thing happened with Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, where Newman played the tortured Brick opposite Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie. As on Broadway, the homosexual theme was obscured and the reason for Brick's marital chaos never made clear. Newman meanwhile won an Oscar nomination. In 1959 he returned to Broadway, and Tennessee Williams, in Sweet Bird of Youth. After that he effectively abandoned the theatre for 33 years, to the dismay of his wife, who believed that stage discipline would make him less reliant on his charm and the mannerisms that were \u2014 for some critics \u2014 becoming over-familiar.</p> <p>In 1960 Newman starred in Otto Preminger's vast and lumbering epic about the birth of Israel, Exodus. A year later he played a jazz musician in the intriguing Paris Blues.</p> <p>Sadly, over the course of his career Newman worked with few major directors on their best films. His work with Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, John Huston and Robert Altman was on their lesser movies. The great exception was Robert Rossen, whose classic adaptation of Walter Tevis's novel The Hustler (1961) gave Newman his most complex early role and marked a turning point in his career. As Fast Eddie, a poolroom shark, whose innate corruptness leads to a brutal come-uppance, Newman crystallised his screen persona \u2014 a blend of vulnerability and bravado, criminality and redemption \u2014 in a performance of new found maturity. It was left to Bafta to give him its award as best actor, while the Academy passed him over for the second time. It was not until he played Eddie again opposite Tom Cruise in The Color of Money (1986) that he received the Oscar.</p> <p>Rossen aside, Newman fared better \u2014 especially in commercial terms \u2014 with sturdy middleweight talents such as Sidney Lumet, Martin Ritt and Richard Brooks in films where what the critic Andrew Sarris memorably described as \"strained seriousness\" seemed to suit Newman's own demeanour. The Hustler initiated the period that brought Newman fame and fortune, in title roles that became part of cinema legend \u2014 among them Ritt's Hud (1963), Harper (1966), Cool Hand Luke (1967) and Butch in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) with Robert Redford. In 10 years he starred in 18 films, as well as directing his first and best movie, Rachel, Rachel (1968), starring Woodward.</p> <p>Curiosities of that period included a reworking of Kurosawa's Rashomon, retitled Outrage (1964), in which the Japanese bandit is transposed to Mexico. Newman relished another character role in an intelligent western, Hombre (1967), directed by Ritt from an Elmore Leonard story. It was compensation for Peter Ustinov's Lady L (1965) with Sophia Loren, the Hitchcock cold war thriller Torn Curtain (1966), opposite Julie Andrews and the comedy The Secret War of Harry Frigg (1968).</p> <p>He looked far happier in the Indianapolis 500 motor racing drama Winning (1969), by which time his fee for any one of his numerous movies far exceeded the $500,000 he had paid years before to extricate himself from a studio contract. Importantly, the choices he made were his own, even if there were, inevitably, duds along the way.</p> <p>Many characters which he played to popular acclaim were less than admirable. Hud is selfish, Luke arrogant, Harper callous and Butch a killer. Other characters were self-obsessed (the racing driver) or wilful and on the margins of society. To such creations, even mean spirited ones, he brought a strength that made him \u2014 alongside Brando \u2014 the acceptable anti-hero of the period.</p> <p>By the 1970s Newman had become more overtly political. He was one of the narrators of the documentary King: a Filmed Record \u2026 from Montgomery to Memphis (1970), about Martin Luther King, and also in that year starred in the anti-radical right drama WUSA. His support for the King documentary was one aspect of his support for civil rights. He also campaigned against the war in Vietnam and had supported Eugene McCarthy's 1968 bid for the presidency. He was vigorous in his opposition to Richard Nixon and proud of being among the top 20 on Nixon's \"most hated\" list.</p> <p>Newman never lost his commitment to liberal causes, but like his exact contemporary Charlton Heston, whose raucous support for the gun lobby, and the right, diametrically opposed Newman's philosophy, he found that overt politicising sometimes misfired. People came to see him, not always to support the cause. He found greater satisfaction as part of the team involved with his charitable foundation.</p> <p>At the height of his fame Newman formed one of several production companies he was to be associated with. Barbra Streisand, Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen and later Dustin Hoffman joined him to set up the First Artists title in 1969. Each agreed to make three movies and Newman \u2014 possibly with less ego than most of his partners \u2014 fulfilled his promise.</p> <p>In 1972, Pocket Money revived his Luke character in all but name. He then made The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean, distractedly directed by his friend Huston during the early throes of one of his many marriages. Finally, in 1975, he revived the Lew Harper detective in a rather sadistic thriller, The Drowning Pool. Soon after, First Artists was wound up and the actor found himself looking for roles that suited a star now into handsome middle age.<br>His box office credibility had been maintained by two smash hits The Sting (1973), which reunited him with Redford, and The Towering Inferno (1974), where he received top billing.</p> <p>Of his two films with Robert Altman, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or, Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) is by far the more successful, but the bizarre futuristic drama Quintet (1979) ended the decade disastrously, a flop compounded by the awfulness of When Time Ran Out (1980). His fans had not taken to the raucous and foul-mouthed Slap Shot (1977), another work which had indicated Newman's search for more original material.</p> <p>He had returned to direction in 1971, salvaging the outdoor drama Sometimes a Great Notion. The following year he produced and directed a vehicle for his wife and daughter Nell, The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds. He was to render her better service 15 years later when he directed The Glass Menagerie (1987), \"to immortalise Joanne's performance\". His other stints as director were a competently made television film, from the play The Shadow Box (1980), and four years later a more personal work Harry &amp; Son. This movie, which gave him his only writing credit (plus star, producer and director), was a highly charged family drama about the difficult relationship between Harry and his teenage son.</p> <p>The subject was almost too close to Newman, whose first child Scott had died of a drug overdose in 1978. Newman felt deeply distressed by his death and the overwrought Harry &amp; Son meant more to its creator than to the general audience.</p> <p>During the 1980s Newman settled into character roles and in 1981 enjoyed success as a tough street cop in Fort Apache, the Bronx. But the cop, like his crane driver Harry, asked us to believe in Newman as a working-class hero and lacked the credibility he brought to Absence of Malice (1981) and The Verdict (1982). Both earned him Oscar nominations. The latter had a screenplay by David Mamet and presented him with a juicy role as a fading, alcoholic lawyer. A part which, as his director Sidney Lumet remarked, required only minimal research. </p> <p>The star had an acknowledged taste for alcohol and despite giving up spirits in mid-career (with a lapse after his son's death), enjoyed his beer and displayed a deep appreciation of vintage wine. I recall having lunch with him one day at his London hotel suite when he particularly liked a white Burgundy. He called the restaurant and ordered the rest of the case to be put in his refrigerator.</p> <p>Bizarrely, his intense performance in The Verdict failed to gain him an Oscar \u2014 a fact taken harder by his wife than by the star. It was suggested that his politics and residence on the east coast since 1962 had alienated him from the conservative Hollywood establishment. In compensation \u2014 after he had taken a year off to concentrate on his motor racing \u2014 he was awarded, aged 60, an honorary Oscar for his lifetime achievement, normally reserved for the truly venerable within the profession. The following year he chose not to attend the awards ceremony \u2014 only to win best actor for The Color of Money.</p> <p>Alongside the accolades, there were other less successful movies, such as Blaze and Fat Man and Little Boy (both 1989). In the former he starred as Earl Long, the philandering 1950s governor of Louisiana. His necessarily strident performance failed to ignite a dull movie. The second work personalised the story of General Groves, the belligerently professional officer who oversaw the Manhattan Project which developed the allied atomic weapons programme. Duller than either of these was Mr &amp; Mrs Bridge (1990), in which he and Woodward wilted under James Ivory's direction. </p> <p>Newman took a long time out of acting and away from conventional Hollywood. Then, in 1994, he had a villainous supporting role in the Coen brothers' satire on big business The Hudsucker Proxy and the lead in Nobody's Fool. Both reminded audiences of his talent. In the latter, he played a grouch unable to relate to his own son but drawn to his shy grandson \u2014 a touching relationship which, the director Robert Benton noted, drew heavily on Newman's own character. The performance gained him another Oscar nomination. Despite this success, he again stayed away from film work except to narrate Baseball (1994) and a 1997 TV series, Super Speedway.<br>In 1995, aged 70, he took part in the 24-hour Daytona endurance race \u2014 becoming the oldest person ever to complete the event, capping his 1979 success when he and his co-driver finished second in the 24-hour Le Mans race. After Daytona, he agreed to quit professional racing and to the relief of his wife opted for his Volvo.</p> <p>Four years after Nobody's Fool, Benton coaxed him back to the studio to star in Twilight (1998), to play an ageing, cynical private detective with a drink problem. The part was tailor-made for Newman, who brought a gravel-voiced and somewhat melancholy charm to the character. Despite a fine cast, the film had a tired feel to it and showed signs of severe post-production pruning.<br>The movie marked a flurry of activity for Newman and he followed it with Message in a Bottle (1999), a tear-jerker in which he played Kevin Costner's crotchety, alcoholic father \u2014 scooping the best reviews, not least for his commanding presence, but also for a willingness to play his age. He again took third billing to decidedly lesser names in Where the Money Is (1999), proving, if proof were needed, that after decades of stardom he was a dedicated professional first and a star a long way second. </p> <p>Newman returned to a substantial film role in Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition (2002). He was cast atypically as the vicious gang boss Rooney who commits a murder witnessed by the small son of one of his henchmen (Tom Hanks). Set in the 1930s, the movie was heavy on atmosphere and menace, provided by Newman and his contract killer, Jude Law. It brought him yet another Oscar nomination and rave reviews.</p> <p>No roles of similar quality followed, but back on stage he scored a hit in 2002 as the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder's Our Town and reprised it on television the following year, with Woodward as executive producer.</p> <p>His final acting appearance was in the prestige television drama Empire Falls, directed by Fred Schepisi from the award-winning novel by Richard Russo, writer of both Twilight and Nobody's Fool. He was executive producer and won an outstanding actor Emmy.</p> <p>In 2007 he announced, \"I think acting is pretty much a closed book to me.\" Yet his voice could be still be heard on a number of short cartoons, as the character Doc Hudson, both in Cars and Mater and the Ghostlight, and finally the Indy Car Series Preview for 2008, showing that his love of motor racing had never left him. In June 2007, he donated $10m dollars from his charitable foundation to Kenyon College from where he had graduated all those years ago. The endowment created the largest scholarship in the history of the college, but it was just one more act that earned him the justified reputation as one of Hollywood's good guys, as well as one of its greatest actors. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Joanne and their three daughters and two daughters from his first marriage.</p> <p><em>Paul Leonard Newman, actor, born January 26 1925; died September 26 2008</em></p>",
  "<p>As part of her \"meet the ineffectual world leaders\" parade to miraculously understand the complexities of modern day geopolitics in less than 40 days, Sarah Palin had a lively interaction with recently elected Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, in New York. </p> <p>It's both surreal and frightening that these two upstart political figures could very well be significant actors in deciding the fate of modern, global relations. It's fitting that the neophytes met in such an awkward and theatrical fashion. </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/24/pakistans-president-tells-palin-she-is-gorgeous/\">CNN report</a>, upon entering the room filled with sycophantic Pakistani officials, Palin was first slobbered over by the country's information minister, Sherry Rehman: </p> <p>\"And how does one keep looking that good when one is that busy?\" Rehman asked when complimenting Palin.</p> <p>\"Oh, thank you,\" Palin said.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, Zardari, the widowed husband of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto, called Palin \"gorgeous\" and then remarked: \"Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you.\"</p> <p>Although some of this hyperbolic flattery is common in elitist social circles in Pakistan, one is hard pressed to find the historical precedent for the following exchange. When Zardari's aide told the two politicians to keep shaking hands for the cameras, Zardari remarked: </p> <p>\"If he's insisting, I might hug.\" </p> <p>Palin smiled politely. Much to Zardari's dismay, no hug took place. </p> <p>And with his flagrant display of sleaze-ball rhetoric, Zardari unwittingly symbolised the turbulent and twisted relationship between the US and its volatile, erstwhile lover Pakistan. One partner actively and shamelessly covets nearness, while the other selfishly exploits these lustful pangs for myopic policy initiatives. The reader can cast the appropriate roles.</p> <p>To those following the circus that is Pakistani politics, they undoubtedly know of last year's power-sharing deal brokered by the US between the then president, Pervez Musharraf and the late Bhutto, who was supposed to become Pakistan's prime minister. Realising their dictator of choice, Musharraf, was losing sway and popularity, the Bush administration hoped Bhutto would step in, allay growing social discontent, and be a more suitable [read: compliant] partner in the relentless and misguided \"war on terror\". The tragic assassination of Bhutto in December unfortunately allowed a power vacuum to develop, one that is now filled by the most unexpected actor: Zardari.</p> <p>In order to facilitate the brokered relationship with Bhutto, Santa Musharraf gave Zardari the best Christmas present of all time in the form of the 2007 <a href=\"http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html\">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a>. This was a loathsome piece of Machiavellian legislation that granted amnesty to politicians, bureaucrats and political workers accused of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism. Naturally, Chief Justice Chaudhry suspended the unlawful ordinance, only to be later suspended himself by Musharraf on trumped up and vague \"corruption charges\". Zardari was the most deserving recipient of this delightful ordinance. As of last year, he was embroiled in several, massive corruption cases in more than four different countries, none of which were vague, figments of dictatorial fantasy. </p> <p>Thankfully for Zardari, Christmas seems to have come twice this year, since millions held in Zardari's Swiss funds have just been released after the dropped corruption charges, thereby making Zardari one of the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4629017.ece\">richest men</a> in Pakistan. He is unique amongst billionaires for making his magical fortune with no semblance of a legitimate job or a functioning business. </p> <p>It should comfort the US that the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a5a961e2-72e3-11dd-983b-0000779fd18c,dwp_uuid=f39ffd26-4bb2-11da-997b-0000779e2340.html\">Financial Times</a> reported their chosen ally in Pakistan was diagnosed last year \"with a range of serious illnesses including dementia, major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in a series of medical reports spanning more than two years\". Coincidentally, at this time last year Zardari was supposed to make appearances at a UK court to challenge pending corruption charges against him in multiple countries. Recently, a spokesperson for Zardari rebuffed these assertions and declared him to be fully recovered and well. </p> <p>Zardari should be heralded as a medical phenomenon and toured across the globe. Who knew the cure for dementia, depression and PTSD was obtaining the post of president of Pakistan? </p> <p>With a deadly terrorist bomb blast at the Islamabad Marriott killing nearly 60 last week and a marked increase in suicide blasts inside Pakistan's borders, one can only hope the US learns from the error of its siding with thugs, thieves and dictators in Pakistan for the past 30 years or thereabouts. Instead, the administration, and even the Democrats, is now siding with Zardari, a known felon and thief, who \u2013 if we are to believe his own doctors \u2013 was suicidal and incoherent just a year ago. Yet, we seem doomed to repeat a myopic policy in yet another desperate attempt to aggressively pursue terrorists hiding within the North-West Frontier province Pakistan-Afghanistan border. </p> <p>If Zardari still harbours those same psychological demons, a surefire politically suicidal move would be to unconditionally support Bush's recent, shortsighted \"offensive\" policy; one that directly threatens Pakistan's sovereignty and emboldens the militants within its borders. Unfortunately, in my recent <a href=\" http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/e/2815/]\">interview with Howard Dean</a> it seems the Democrats would follow suit in order to hunt al-Qaida and appear strong in the \"war on terror\". Instead, this policy should be thoroughly re-examined and critically questioned in order to avoid a massive, inevitable blowback, further destabilising an already fragile nation state with access to nuclear weapons. </p> <p>If anything, it would temporarily diffuse the rampant anger and disgust proliferating amongst the Pakistani people. Many who believe the US is merely installing and supporting, via a sham-democratic process, yet another puppet to serve its own interests. </p> <p>Although it is obvious Zardari wants hug his \"partner\" close, nuzzling comfortably in its bosom, the question remains: how does America hug back?</p>",
  "<p>His <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/movies/AP-Obit-Newman.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1\">death </a>is very sad news.

Getting beyond the A-level notables, check him out in \"The Young Philadelphians\" and \"Torn Curtain\" and even \"Slap Shot.\"</p> <p>I would imagine that he was very excited about Barack Obama and the prospect of America's first black president. Not intending to predict the election outcome, I'd say it's a real shame he didn't live to have the chance to see it happen.<br></p>",
  "<p>There are almost as many ways to evaluate a presidential debate as there are people who watch them, but the only metric that matters is how they affect voters' ballots on election day. Thing is, measurement on that one is as tricky as they come, and it changes over time. Instant reactions matter only insofar as they influence the crucial metric, and this too, takes place over time. Facts don't matter at all unless the media decides to call you on them, and only then, if everyone agrees. Stupid stuff, like sighing or looking at your watch can lose you an election.</p> <p>By most standards of logic, Barack Obama won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama1\">last night's debate</a>. His answers were more consistent with the complexities of the issues he addressed, more attuned to the nuances each situation implied and more forward looking to the kinds of challenges America faces than John McCain, who seemed<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.mccain.obama.debate\"> far more intent on disparaging his opponent's experience</a> and touting his own. But none of that matters. What matters is the vibe each man communicated - the frame the men and women of the media chose to put on it afterwards.</p> <p>Obama won here too, and he did so, in large measure, because his campaign managed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/27/barackobama.johnmccain\">spin most of the pundits</a> their way. Following the debate, virtually everyone I heard - save the apparatchiks on Fox News - called the debate a draw. McCain \"recovered his footing\" following a week when he appeared in danger of going off the deep end, while Obama \"held his own\" and \"stood his ground\" while under constant attack.</p> <p>It could easily have gone another way. Almost all of the liberals from whom I heard and those with whom I watched the debate were in a state of near panic and considerable frustration as Obama - almost always on the defensive - refused to go for McCain's jugular despite any number of opportunities. To pick just one, how come the guy who was harping on the significance of experience so many times picked a VP candidate with none whatsoever? OK, two, does McCain have any idea how expensive it would be to build 75 new nuclear power plants, and where would we store all that waste when no state in America is willing to accept it? OK, three, aren't all those horrible consequences McCain mentions as the likely cost of \"losing\" in Iraq actually the consequences of McCain's bad judgment in choosing to invade it in the first place? I could go on.</p> <p>But Obama was not looking to appeal to people like us. He was playing to a crowd that needed to see whether he could handle foreign affairs competently. He was looking to appear presidential. He wanted merely to neutralise McCain's strongest suit - the alleged commander-in-chief card - and lay the groundwork to take advantage of his strongest suit, which is change in the economy.</p> <p>While Jim Lehrer, the moderator, appeared neutral throughout, he defined the terms of the debate almost exclusively on McCain's terrain. It was foreign affairs circa, 1960, with the US going mano-a-mano with enemies left and right. There was no talk of security threats like climate change, natural disaster, migration crises, economic interdependence and the like. It was all stuff that connects in people's minds with McCain's military background. What's more, being black, Obama also needed to be cool rather than angry, despite McCain's rather rude and condescending treatment of him. He needed to point out that McCain strength was really a recipe for more of the same. And for those people who had never spent any extended time with him on their television sets - imagine that - he needed to appear to be a likeable guy.</p> <p>Obama did not score particularly big on any of these goals. And it sure would not have killed him to speak a bit more personally about his feelings and family and bonds with the people and issues that drive his ambition and worldview. But he scored big enough. He was cool. He was fluid. He made no mistakes. He passed all the tests that were said to be scheduled for the evening.</p> <p>When it was over, the pundits pronounced it a draw - which, given Obama's lead in the swing state polls and McCain's weakness in the areas of debate to follow, was what his people could count as a victory. No pundit credibly called the debate a clear victory for either side. And the focus groups that CBS was monitoring were clearly <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/27/opinion/polls/main4482119.shtml\">put off my McCain's aggressiveness and insulting tone</a> toward his opponent. </p> <p>The Obama campaign's cool in the face of panic elsewhere in the Democratic party frustrates many people, but it both suits the candidate's temperament and fits in strategically with the plan the campaign has mapped out from the beginning. As McCain lurches from place to place, Obama stands his ground, smiling, and waiting and patiently moving his pieces on the board to the places he wants them when the time for the checkmate move arrives.</p> <p>Relax everybody. We won't know whether America is ready to elect a black man until election day finally arrives. But this is one black man who knows what he is doing.</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday when he addresses the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, London mayor Boris Johnson will be hugged to the bosom of the very body whose mothering milk he no longer imbibes. By accident, design and both, The Blond has become detached from the breast that gave him new political life. The bright but hapless junior celeb urged into the mayoral race last year has now got <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hair-Funny-Places-Babette-Cole/dp/0099266261\">hair in funny places</a> \u2013 don't press me on the details \u2013 a big, deep voice and a home all of his own. </p> <p>It has not been a painless parting. The disentangling of Johnson's young regime from Tory HQ's apron strings has been part comedy of errors, part power struggle and not wholly conducive to putting policy into rapid effect. The transition team of consultants installed to smooth the transfer of power was first depleted by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/23/london.race\">loss of James McGrath</a> thanks to a crass remark, then sapped of credibility by Nick Boles's <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23520233-details/Boris+Johnson+aide+takes+the+blame+for+failure+to+vet+Lewis/article.do\">admission</a> that there'd been no time to check the credentials of Ray Lewis, Johnson's deputy for young people who was <a href=\"http://jamescleverly.blogspot.com/2008/07/ray-lewis-resigns.html\">forced to resign</a> under a cloud of scandal. The loss of Lewis was itself a kind of break with Tory central: Johnson had adopted him, but David Cameron had done the same thing long before. </p> <p>The decisive breach, though, came with the <a href=\"http://labourboy.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/to-the-prince-of-darkness-begone-tim-parker-resigns/\">departure of Tim Parker</a>, the ruthless asset-stripper placed at the head of the GLA Group to, in his own words, \"run the place\" on the mayor's behalf. Parker is a mate of Tory bigwig <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-3429,00.html\">Francis Maude</a>. He was installed to bring fat-slashing private sector rigour to a bureaucracy held by common Tory consent to be bloated and bursting with waste. Within a few weeks he was gone, effectively levered out, many believe, by Sir Simon Milton, Johnson's planning adviser. Certainly, this former leader of Westminster City Council, knighted for his services to local government, is not a fellow who would take kindly to being bossed about by some unelected private equity buccaneer.</p> <p>Sir Simon has emerged empowered from the embarrassing debris of transition. He is the force behind a planned restructuring, revealed in a document called <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/speeches/20080910-future.jsp\">Organising for Delivery</a>. A suitable subtitle might be Better Late Than Never, I Suppose. Meanwhile, Johnson himself has become more hands-on, taking the chair of the board of Transport for London that Parker was lined up to occupy. Officially, the mayor had recognised that the political nature of decisions taken there required a man with a mandate to preside. Voices off say that the upshot of the battles in his own bureaucracy left him with little choice, but also that he's warming to the task. Far from cutting a swathe through TfL as the search-and-destroy set urged, he appears rather glad of its expertise.</p> <p>Scope for further discord remains: in a persuasive <a href=\"http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/tim-parker-ray-lewis-janet-worth/20084751\">piece for Mayorwatch</a>, former UKIP assembly member Damian Hockney has criticised the loss from the top of City Hall's bureaucracy of Janet Worth, the sort of subtle public servant who knows how to manage change; reports persist that not every member of Johnson's team is operating effectively or happy with their lot. But now, at last, there is some hope that the shape and true character of Johnson's mayoralty will start emerging from the smoke. </p> <p>What form of Tory governance will be revealed? The signs so far have been intriguingly mixed, due in part to Johnson learning \u2013 as politicians tend to \u2013 the banal truth that putting campaign pledges into effect is less straightforward than it seemed when they were made. It's one thing to talk the talk about cutting costs, devolving power and being \"cleaner, safer, greener\", another to walk the walk, especially when unannounced lamp posts keep on getting in your way. The outline principles coincide with Cameron's detoxing of the Tory national brand, but Johnson has hinted at impatience with it too. </p> <p>His Daily Telegraph columns \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/15/dailytelegraph.pressandpublishing\">kerching</a>! \u2013 provide the strongest evidence. As British Olympians struck gold, he <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/08/19/british-medals-at-beijing-olympics-and-2012/\">seemed to dissent</a> from the \"broken society\" message of his leader. This week, his <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/09/23/financial-crisis-banking-and-housing/\">ringing defence</a> of London's bankers contrasted sharply with the shrinking silence of young Dave and <a href=\"http://www.georgeosborne.co.uk/\">boy George</a>. He's also used his space in Her Majesty's broadsheet to <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/09/16/471/\">stick up for</a> the BBC licence fee. Though not in this case at sharp odds with his party's top brass, the article again suggested a developing political autonomy and screams of agony from the right, which have become a familiar sound recently. </p> <p>Is Mayor Boris the son of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher\">Thatch</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan\">Supermac</a>, or some novel genetic hybrid of the two? Will his mayoralty make the mould for a Cameron government or come to be seen as a platform for a Bullingdon Club old boys rivalry? In the end, it may not matter much at all: City Hall is not 10 Downing Street and London is not Britain. From the conference stage in Britain's second city the leader of its first will surely tickle and thrill the true-blue faithful, as he has always done. But many will be alive to any small deviation from the new party line \u2013 Cameron among them.</p>",
  "<p>The blogosphere was buzzing after the first presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain. A cursory tour of sites suggests that it was a close-run debate with the Democratic candidate getting the edge. </p> <p>A <a href=\"www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/04/opinion/polls/main4154051.shtml\">CBS News instant poll</a> found that among undecided voters, Obama won the debate \u2013 40% backed the Illinois senator, 22% thought McCain won and 38% called it a draw. </p> <p>Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, says the debate was a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/madeleine-albright/a-breakthrough-night-for_b_129786.html\">\"breakthrough\" for Obama </a> \"who showed himself truly ready to be president\". </p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">Huffington Post</a>, she writes: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"He responded knowledgeably, thoughtfully and confidently to the toughest questions on the economy, Iraq, and terror. Meanwhile, Senator McCain spent so much time attacking his opponent, he neglected to show how a McCain-Palin administration would differ from Bush-Cheney. As a result, Obama answered the threshold question about his candidacy; McCain did not.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On the same site, actor Sean Penn says the American public are the losers because the debate was \"dismissive of an American public's need to know anything beyond jingoistic self-aggrandizement\". Musician Sheryl Crow found McCain \"repetitive, stuck in the past and loopy\" while Obama had an \"in-depth understanding of foreign affairs\" and \"thinks on his feet\".</p> <p>Several pundits and commentators try to analyse why McCain did not appear to make eye contact with Obama during the debate. A psychotherapist writing on Talking Points Memo says McCain's behaviour suggests one of two things: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"<a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/220226.php\">[McCain] doesn't want to make eye contact because he is prone to losing control of his emotions</a> if he deals directly with the other person, or his anger masks fear and the eye contact may increase or substantiate the fear.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Everyone will think their guy has won the debate, according to Jim Geraghty on the National Review website, but for him it was McCain who came out top.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"If you were wavering on McCain, nothing you saw tonight should give you doubts and probably reassured you a great deal. In that sense, <a href=\"http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWExYTI3MjJkMWVlZmE3N2ZhODNiYzQ3YTk5NzkxYWI=\">tonight was a major win for McCain</a>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For Matthew Yglesias on Think Progress, it was a draw. \"<a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/\">McCain got a couple of good punches in and so did Obama</a>.\" He says McCain did not prove his supposed superiority on the issue of national security: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"For the candidate who's losing, a tie amounts to a loss. He needs to find opportunities to gain ground on Obama and he doesn't seem to me to have gotten much done.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The New York Times <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/check-point-the-first-debate/?hp\">check point blog </a>examined the accuracy of the candidates' statements in real time. For example, McCain's claim that Obama voted \"to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year\" is wrong. Obama claimed that McCain had said that the US \"can muddle through in Afghanistan\" \u2013 when he actually said \"may\", making the meaning quite different.</p> <p>Obama also managed to irritate Henry Kissinger by misquoting him on Iran. The Democratic candidate tried to suggest that Kissinger, a McCain adviser, advocated meeting Iran's leaders without any precondition. He failed to make it clear that Kissinger did not favour talks at the presidential level \u2013 a fact that the former secretary of state pointed out <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/09/tws_exclusive_kissinger_unhapp.asp\">in a statement after the debate.</a></p> <p>But what's your view?

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Kick-off at the Emirates is at 5.30pm. Coverage will start right here about 15 minutes before that.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>No messing, here are the teams:</strong></p> <p><strong>Arsenal</strong>: Almunia, Sagna, Toure, Gallas, Clichy, Eboue,<br>Fabregas, Denilson, Walcott, Adebayor, Van Persie. Subs:<br>Fabianski, Vela, Ramsey, Song Billong, Silvestre, Djourou,<br>Bendtner.</p> <p><strong>Hull</strong>: Myhill, McShane, Zayatte, Turner, Dawson, Marney,<br>Boateng, Geovanni, Ashbee, Cousin, King. Subs: Duke, Hughes,<br>Garcia, Mendy, Halmosi, Folan, Ricketts.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: Alan Wiley (Staffordshire)</p> <p>That looks as though Arsenal have decided to send all their kids back to their PlayStations in favour of their acknowledged \"first-team\" (minus the knacked likes of Rosicky, Nasri and Eduardo). For Hull, the experienced hatchet man George Boateng returns to the midfield, as does the only Brazilian deemed surplus to Man City's new samba renaissance, Geovanni. I'm not sure where they're going to line up in midfield, with Marney and Ashbee already in the central areas, but that'll become apparent soon-ish, no doubt.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><strong>Afernoon all. It's off to the Emirates</strong> for today's tea-time fixture, where Arsenal entertain the Premier League new boys Hull City. The hosts have only been beaten here once in the league, and Hull, despite a much better than expected start to the season, are still looking for their first away win in the top flight.</p> <p>The truth behind the statistics is perhaps even more concerning for the Tigers: Arsenal's under-9s put Sheffield United to the sword in the Carling Cup in midweek, hop-scotching past them 6-0. A couple of weeks back, Hull's first team went to Wigan and got spanked 5-0. On paper, this is a mismatch. </p> <p><strong>But, but, but.</strong> Despite being everyone's tip to finish rock bottom (betting without Spurs and Newcastle, obviously) Hull are riding high, and were seventh in this morning's table (before the 3pm kick-offs confused things) and victory here would take them, improbably enough, into Uefa Cup consideration. Do they dare to dream? </p> <p>It ain't gonna happen, but just chew it over for a while. Perhaps more pertinently, they only need three more points this season to match Derby's paltry 11 from the whole of the last campaign, bringing some measure of respectability to Championship play-off winners.</p> <p>The Guardian's useful \"match pointers\" section this morning revealed that both goals conceded by Arsenal this season have come from corners, so expect some mad hoofs towards the byeline from Hull in the hope that they clip an Arsenal leg. Attack-wise, Arsenal have been typically sublime - zinging and pinging from defence, through midfield and up to the front two. Emmanuel Adebayor has shrugged of his sluggish start to be thwacking them in left and right, while Robin van Persie - 15 goals in his past 20 Premier Leagues starts, thank-you Guardian \"match-pointers\" - has reclaimed his place after getting over knack.</p> <p>Goals is what we're looking for.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>The graphics wizards at Setanta</strong> reckon Hull are going for a 4-3-1-2 formation, with Geovanni tucking in behind the front two of King and Cousin. Meanwhile, Kevin Dardis is interested in the truth behind the mystery that is MBM: \"As you seem pretty sure about the outcome of today's game, I was just wondering if you would dare to predict how many mails you will get today. Indeed, as with everything else football related, are there statistics available about which Guardian commentator has received the most and least mails and so on and so forth?\"<br>Well, there's not a league table or anything, but these Saturday afternoon games aren't where it's really at for emails. That said, having covered the dead rubber between Portugal and Switzerland in the European Championship and then countless through-the-night Olympics shifts, the four mails already lurking in my inbox is looking like a deluge. Of course, if I was to say something really stupid, spell a player's name wrong, or criticise Liverpool, Gmail would practically break down.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> And they're off, with McShane getting an early cross in towards Cousin, who can't quite turn Toure. \"Mate Hull won at Newcastle the other week,\" bellows Steve Joseph, and he's right to notice the mistake in the preamble. The MBM researchers got that one wrong when they handed me my fact sheet this morning. Apologies. (See what I mean, Kevin Dardis?)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3 mins: </strong>Andy Dawson's brother plays for Spurs; Dean Marney used to play for Spurs. Are the Arsenal crowd interested in petty booing of tangential links to their neighbours? No. No they're not. On the pitch, Cousin goes up leading with an elbow, and Boateng trips Walcott. This might set the tone.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 mins: </strong>Eboue finds some space in the middle and attempts to slip a ball through to Van Persie. His run is, well, dealt with by Turner, who shoves the Dutchman far enough away from the escaping ball.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> Corner for Arsenal, whipped in from the left by Fabregas. Hull initially struggle to deal with it, but eventually it falls to Cousin, who powers forward. Sagna tackles him, but it skews to Geovanni who flies down the left and wins a corner. It comes to nothing except an outrageous overhead kick attempt from the same Brazilian that flies well over.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>10 mins:</strong> Zayatte cuts out a Walcott cross for another Arsenal corner, but Hull clear. There's acres od space for Fabregas soon after, but his attempted flick into the box is cut out by the commanding Andy Dawson. Like brother like, oh.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> Free-kick for Arsenal out on the right that Fabregas attempts to float into the middle. He succeeds, I suppose, but only floats it into the hands of Boaz Myhill. Gary Naylor wants to know: \"What do people think of The Emirates Stadium? Externally, it's very spectacular, but once inside, it feels like a business class airport lounge. On taking one's seat, the absence of defined stands or ends is a little disorienting, with the seats just rolling out like a M\u00f6bius strip as one scan the scene. It's more like watching football on a wide screen television than live. And the old Highbury was a beautiful thing.\" I'm guessing that a lot of people who could best answer this question are, well, elsewhere right now. But the floor is open.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14 mins:</strong> That's the first clear cut chance of the match as an Adebayor cross-field pass is deflected by Boateng to the feet of Fabregas, galloping into the box. The Hull defence is opened right up, but the Spaniard drags a shot well wide.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>15 mins:</strong> No goal! A great ball in from the right by Bacary Sagna lands perfectly on the bonce of Emmanuel Adebayor. He nods it past Myhill and it nestles in the bottom corner, but not before the striker has needlessly shoved his defender in the back and conceded a free kick.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 mins:</strong> Another glorious chance spurned by Arsenal, this time Theo Walcott taking far too long to get a shot away on the edge of the box. The young whipper-snapper has been played in beautifully by a delightful curved ball inside the left back, and the England winger is through on goal. But he dithers and Dawson nips in. The goal is definitely coming here.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> A comedic goal-mouth scramble, featuring Fabregas, Gallas and Adebayor, only results in a corner as Hull somehow scrape and scrap it clear. \"MBM researchers?\" doubts Mac Millings. \"I thought that MBM research consisted of you reading the Guardian's \"Match Pointers\". Still, it's good to learn that research is going on, because before today, I was labouring under the misapprehension that MBM research and reporting involved, y'know, watching the match on the television, followed by telling us, in text format, some of what happened.\" Well, consider yourself corrected, Mac.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> A rare moment of play outside of Hull's half results in a hopeless ball lofted forward, comfortably gathered by Manuel Almnia, who would be right to feel aggrieved that he's had to put down his pint and the crossword to make that simple catch. He hoofs forward, and that'll be that for another 20 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> Geovanni spanks a long effort high and wide, then Walcott breaks with it down at the other end. His \"cross\", though, is nowhere near any of his colleagues. That's actually not the worst thing Walcott does in the space of about 30 seconds - he then misses another golden opportunity to score when he's unmarked, eight yards out, and is picked out by a cross from the left from Eboue (I think). Walcott should have just thumped it home, but instead wants an extra touch and loses control.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>27 mins:</strong> \"I'm with Gary Naylor on this one,\" panders Tom Isitt. He's talking about the Emirates, by the way. \"Highbury was great, and each stand has a sense of identity (or lack thereof, depending on where you were sitting). The New Place is very comfortable, but is soulless and lacks any distinguishing features other than lots and lots of sensible \"fans\" who look at you like you're some kind of loony when you stand up and sing, or scream abuse at Eboue. I used to go to almost every home game at Highbury, but I hate the Emirates and rarely go more than two or three times a season. I'm a stranger in my own home, and I hate that.\" All this while the Arsenal cuts man is on to deal with some claret pouring forth from the lip of Emmanuel Eboue after a tangle with McShane. Nothing sinister, but they went over together and something cut Eboue as they did.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> Hull have now held firm for half an hour, although Arsenal have been uncharacteristically profligate up front. the visitors haven't worked much of their own in the final third, most recently an attempted flick through the Arsenal back line from Marney cut out by Denilson before it reaches King.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>32 mins:</strong> Geovanni pops up on the left wing - he's been the busiest of Hull's players, although hasn't produced that much - but there are few options and Arsenal clear. Another Brazilian, Denilson, starts something down Arsenal's left, which also comes to nothing. This is a bit scrappy now.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>35 mins:</strong> Eboue tries to cut in from the left wing, but McShane comfortably dispossesses him and clears. Phil Brown barks something at his team, who may or may not be fitted with ear-pieces to hear all this through that peculiar drive-through head-set.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Fabregas lifts a ball over the advancing Hull backline, but Adebayor has gone marginally too soon and is given offside. The same applies to Van Persie, who attempts to spin off his marker and collect a dinked through ball from Adebayor, but the linesman flaps some yellow.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 mins: </strong>Walcott again goes marauding into the Hull box, collects a ball cut back from the right, but again refuses to take a first time hit and the danger is cleared. At the other end, Geovanni, Cousin and McShane combine to give some encouragement to the away fans, but Almunia is untroubled.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 mins:</strong> An Arsenal corner is comfortably cleared and Marlon King is away on the break. He charges forward, but misses a great chance to put in Geovanni, wide open in the middle, instead waiting until Cousin catches up, by which point the chance has gone.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Better from Walcott, who stays out wide right, then goes scampering into the box leaving Andy Dawson with grass stains on his shorts. Walcott attempts to feed Adebayor, but he can't get a shot away.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 mins:</strong> Brilliant and then woeful from Arsenal, whose build up play is sublime but whose finishing is shoddy. The ball is pinged into the feet of Adebayor, whose lay-off to Eboue is sublime and leaves the midfielder only needing to larrup it past Myhill for 1-0. But he wants another pass on this flowing move and needlessly squares it for a colleague. Hull clear.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45+1mins:</strong> More excellent build up play comes to nothing, when the full-stretch of the American Myhill plucks the ball off the head of the Arsenal striker. I saw neither the crosser nor the intended target, I'm afraid, since I was typing up that last near miss. It might not be Setanta, but it's cheaper.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep, peeeeep.</strong> Half-time at the Emirates, and it's nil-nil. Who'd a thunk.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Something to chew over from Gary Naylor:</strong> \"It's not \"Boring Boring Arsenal\" any more, but it is \"Predictable Predictable Arsenal\" playing the same way home and away whatever the opposition. As your excellent colleague Jonathan Wilson <a href=\"http://pseudscorner.blogspot.com/2008/08/inverting-pyramid-by-jonathan-wilson.html\">points out in his brilliant book</a> playing systems have always been countered successfully by coaches willing to think hard and players willing to listen and learn. Big Sam Allardyce thought hard about how to beat Arsenal and did so often - why won't anyone else?\" I've got high hopes for Joe Kinnear. High, high hopes.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>\"The old cliche still fits Arsenal,\" </strong>says George Templeton, and literary scholars had best look away now. \"A whole lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.\" Those, I believe, were originally the words of Macbeth, put into his mouth by William Shakespeare. Can we really apply them to a footballing cliche context? Please, strut and fret no more.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Another email:</strong> \"Good news!\" says support@lovefilm.com \"We've just posted the following title to you, so please look out for it. Triumph Of The Will (1934) - Leni Riefenstahl. The official record of the Nazi Party Congress held in Nuremberg in 1934.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>46 mins: Away we go again. </strong>No changes.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> The second half gets underway with a corner to Hull that is headed out to Boateng on the edge of the box. He skims a low shot into the mixer and a flailing Arsenal leg, shot out in front of Almunia could have diverted it anywhere. In the end, it's over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> High hopes for this second half for both sets of fans - and neutrals. Arsenal go right up the other end and have two half chances: Turner clearing from in front of Van Persie and then something else happening down the left that was also cleared. I missed it.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>50 mins: GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Hull</strong><br>As scrappy as a the whole younger generation of Doos. After Hull have the temerity to attack again, Van Persie utilises the empty acres of midfield to slip it to Walcott scampering down the right. He wriggles into the box, twisting and turning among the Hull defence, before crossing low into a packed six-yard box. Fabregas is one of them in there, as is McShane, and one of them gets the last touch as it inches over the line.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>53 mins:</strong> All of a sudden, Hull are all sixes and sevens and Adebayor is gifted a gilt-edged chance that only a last-gasp lunge can divert over Myhill's bar. It's a very weak clearance that finds itself at the striker's feet, three yards out, after no one picked up Van Persie. But Hull breathe again as Adebayor, perhaps not believing his luck, is too slow to bury it.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>55 mins:</strong> Van Persie, after a quiet first half, has burst into action and makes himself more space in the box with a sharp 180 degree turn. His shot, though, is powerful but wide from a very tight angle. At the other end, Dean Marney cultivates a half-chance for himself, with an overhead kick that gets Almunia diving left to smother.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>56 mins:</strong> Jet-heeled Walcott thunders past Dawson down the right, but he's still not able to find the target as he attempts to cut in from the byeline. His shot, such as it is, goes wide. \"Is the 'many faces of Phil Brown' montage Hull tourist board's take on the Dallas intro?\" asks Nick Smith. You give it too much credit. That, Nick, is the limits of my Photoshopping skills right there.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>59 mins:</strong> More Arsenal trying to walk the ball into the net shame, again featuring Eboue. He passes up another opportunity to thump it past Myhill and his attempted cute pass is cut out. The rebound skews to Van Persie who is significantly more direct, but even less accurate. It's caught in the Upper Tier.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>62 mins: Goal! Arsenal 1-1 Hull </strong> Pick. That. One. Out. What a strike from Geovanni. That's remarkable. Hull have a decent few minutes of possession, but their probing is looking impotent against a solid Arsenal back-line. That's only until the ball falls to the Brazilian, 25 yards out and left of centre. He absolutely thunders a shot, dipping, swerving, yes samba-ing, into the top right hand corner, past Almunia's despairing leap.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> \"I once described a ball as 'spiralling' in a minute-by-minute,\" says my colleague Gregg Roughly. \"Someone questioned if that was possible.\" I'm with Gregg on this one though. That spiralled into the net.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>66 mins: Goal! Arsenal 1-2 Hull</strong> Pigeons, cat. Cat, pigeons. That's 2-1 to Hull. It's direct from a corner, lifted straight onto the head of Daniel Cousin, who rises above Gallas to power it into the top left-hand corner. Not for the first time this season, Gallas is beaten to it in the air. That's now the <em>third</em> goal scored from a corner against Arsenal this season. Achilles heel, anyone.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>69 mins:</strong> \"Was Geovanni's goal as good as the one he scored to beat Man United?\" asks George Templeton. Better is the answer.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 mins:</strong> Nicklas Bendtner is on in place of Emmanuel Eboue, who has missed a couple of good chances for Arsenal today and can have no complaints about seeing his number on the board. A couple of scraps in Hull's box, the second of which ends in an Arsenal corner and a drilled shot from Van Persie.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 mins:</strong> Geovanni is replaced by Bryan Hughes for Hull, his job done. Arsenal have another couple of corners as Hull manage to deflect everything behind. These last 18 minutes are going to be frantic.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> Walcott, free again on the right, this time fires in a pacy cross, which Adebayor is eyebrows away from diverting goalward. Carlos Vela is stripped off and ready to come on, fresh from his midweek hattrick in the Carling Cup.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>76 mins:</strong> Walcott is going to be the one to make way for Arsenal, so we're reliably informed, and he misses out the chance to snatch glory before he departs when he shows too much to the Hull defence and another chance is snuffed out.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>77 mins:</strong> Walcott off, Vela on. Boateng off, Garcia on. Sagna booked. Just the facts.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>78 mins:</strong> Fabregas sizzles one in from the edge of the box. Myhill parries it behind. \"Go easy!\" pleads Padraig Curran. \"Is there any chance you could commentate on the last few minutes of the game in a manner which comes across as sympathetic to Arsenal? It would make me feel a lot better.\" I actually don't know if Padraig is an Arsenal fan or not. Because the idea of people feeling sympathetic towards Arsenal during the closing minutes of a home match against Hull is surely even <em>more</em> funny for supporters of other lower-table strugglers. Yes, Spurs and Manchester United, I mean you.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>80 mins: </strong>Mendy on for Cousin as Hull look to sit on their lead. Did I really just write that? Yes I did. Hull are sitting on their lead.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>81 mins:</strong> It's <em>that</em> close for Arsenal, when Fabregas plays Van Persie in down the right. He takes it in his stride and aims one across Myhill towards the bottom left corner. But it beats both goalkeeper and post and is out.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>83 mins:</strong> Denilson, who has been mighty ineffective here today, trundles just about the softest shot of all time at Myhill, which the keeper actually opts, and is able, to trap with the side of his foot. At the other end, Hull break, but aren't sharp enough to stab in a loose ball.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> William Gallas very, very nearly makes amends for his prior mistake when he rises highest to a corner and absolutes thunders a header onto the bottom of the crossbar. It bounces down and Carlos Vela can't poke it in. Big let off.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Immense amount of pressure on Hull now. Garcia fouls Van Persie on the edge of the box, but the Dutchman's free-kick hits the wall. The corner comes to nothing. Myhill finally gets both hands on it and is relieved just to be able to whack one forward before the next foray comes.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>88 mins:</strong> Arsenal launch another long ball into the box, which draws Myhill out of his comfort zone. He fails to gather, but the offside flag goes up and he is reprieved. \"How's Phil Brown's expression?\" wonders Mac Millings. \"I'm guessing either \"Ladies' Man Phil\" or \"Windy Phil\".\" It's \"2-1 up at the Emirates with two minutes, plus injury time to go Phil\", which he has never practiced before.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> There are going to be four minutes of injury time, which pretty much translates as 3-2 to Arsenal, pessimism fans.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins: </strong>Wonderful, wonderful save from Myhill, who deserves to earn three points just for that. Fabregas sees it opening up in front of him and he thwacks it goalward, bending left. The American keeper throws himself that way, and one-hands it behind.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Kolo Toure, up for the corner, misses another gilt-edged one when it falls to him in acres of space on the left of the box. He slices well, well wide. And then a long-shot from Van Persie goes into the stands, and it's looking very bleak for Arsenal now.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep, 2-1 to Hull, peeeeeep!</strong><br>That, folks, is that. An extraordinary upset here as Hull get their <em>second</em> away win of the season, and at the Emirates Stadium of Arsenal FC, no less. Arsenal misfired up front all afternoon; Hull didn't, and they made the most of their half-chances. Hull are up to sixth after that, Arsenal are fourth. Thank you and bye.</p>",
  "<p>In Europe, Ramadan creeps up on you with none of the fanfare associated with the fasting season in the Muslim world, where it is a unique time of year. It is a month of fasting and feasting, frugalness and greed, night turning into day, spirituality and commercialism. When it started this year, we'd arranged, by chance, to go out for drinks with some friends, where we, blasphemously, drank an impromptu seasonal toast.</p> <p>While the majority of people go without food or drink from dawn to dusk, some Muslims suffer a special kind of thirst. For those who drink alcohol, the holy month can be a very dry spell. </p> <p>Many do this voluntarily, much like Christians give up certain so-called bad habits for Lent. One Bosnian woman describes people who practice this temporary abstention as being \"<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSL271864520080909\">Muslims on batteries</a>\". In Bosnia, the majority of Muslims still drink alcohol, despite the growing religiosity of society there since the traumas of the Balkans conflict in the 1990s. </p> <p>When I used to fast, I would have one for the road just before the holy month began, try to keep on the Ramadan wagon for the fasting season, and join friends for a new season of drinking after the Eid festival. </p> <p>Curiously, Ramadan was the only facet of Islam I stuck to religiously. Long after I'd stopped entering mosques except to admire their architecture, I still continued to fast. This may have had something to do with the periodic and festive nature of the season, rather like becoming a football fan for the duration of the World Cup. The discipline, humility and endurance required may have played a role because it made it a cleansing personal challenge, as opposed to an empty a religious ritual.</p> <p>While it's OK for Muslims to stop drinking during Ramadan out of choice, society often takes a paternalistic attitude towards drinkers. Egypt, for instance, has a booming alcohol industry, which comes to a virtual grinding halt during the holy month. </p> <p>During Ramadan, Egyptians are barred from purchasing alcohol and all alcoholic outlets besides ones catering to foreigners close down. The first time I became aware of this peculiar legislation was when I was out with some foreign friends and we ordered drinks at the bar, only to be told by the waiter that I wasn't allowed to. </p> <p>Feeling humiliated, I complained to the manager who made sympathetic noises and admitted that he would love to serve Egyptians, who made up the bulk of his clientele, but he would face an enormous fine if an inspector walked in. In fact, <a href=\"http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16684\">Ramadan is a month of major losses</a> for bars and restaurants that serve alcohol.</p> <p>This law is patently unfair because it forces Egyptian Christians to live by an Islamic rule, and it casts the state in the role of moral guardian. If alcohol is legal, what right does the government have to force its citizens to behave temporarily like supposedly good Muslims?</p> <p>It also leads to some absurd situations. Egyptians who do not wish to stop drinking clean out the off licences just before they shut. Sometimes in mixed groups of expats and Egyptians, the foreigners will order binge quantities of booze, while the Egyptians will order a token soft drink and, with one eye on the door, they will all make merry. </p> <p>The first Ramadan I was in Egypt after I acquired Belgian citizenship, I seized the opportunity to order a stiffer drink than previously permitted, and surreptitiously poured beer into an Egyptian friend's coke as we moaned about the injustice of it all. </p> <p>Well, I shouldn't complain too much \u2013 at least drinking in Egypt is not a punishable offence like it is in the Islamic theocracies of Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, and the law is more honest than in, say, Morocco, where Muslims are officially not allowed to consume alcohol, but everyone turns a blind eye, except during Ramadan.</p> <p>In some countries, an alcohol war is brewing between alcohol-free puritans and the booze brigade. Despite having licences to operate during Ramadan, several restaurants and bars in the Jordanian capital, Amman, have been shut down by over-zealous health inspectors on questionable pretexts.</p> <p>The owner of <a href=\"http://www.world66.com/asia/middleeast/jordan/amman/internetcafes\">Books@Caf\u00e9</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.7iber.com/blog/2008/09/18/closing-of-bookscafe/\">popular Amman hangout</a>, said: \"This is about where we stand in hypocrisy and bigotry \u2026 and where we will be if we remain quiet.\" His article drew more than 200 outraged responses, with one poster describing the closures as \"the pinnacle in state-sponsored stupidity\".</p> <p>In Turkey, which normally has a relaxed attitude to drinking, a <a href=\"http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/9968845.asp?scr=1\">shop owner was attacked</a> for selling alcohol during Ramadan in an upmarket Ankara neighbourhood.</p> <p>Turkish revellers have been organising a <a href=\"http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=114738\">campaign of boozy civil disobedience</a> \u2013 which has continued into Ramadan \u2013 to defend their right to drink at a popular Istanbul quay. Meanwhile, life goes on as normal in <a href=\"http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=114579\">Istanbul's Kad\u0131k\u00f6y district</a>, where some restaurants serve traditional <em>iftar</em> for the pious and others offer alcohol for the secular punters.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of Muslims will be looking forward to the post-fasting festivities of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr\">Eid el-Fitr</a>, which will be around October 1, where I will get to observe the Indian version in Delhi. For Muslim drinkers, they will be eager to fall off the Ramadan wagon and head for their nearest watering hole.</p>",

  "<p><strong>10am:</strong> Oh yes, it's ladies' night, and the feeling's right. Eight celebrity females will be strapping on their sparkly stilettoes this evening and attempting either a fabulous foxtrot or a sizzling salsa with their professional partners. Will Head Judge Len Goodman mark anyone lower than 5? How long will it take anyone to mention that it's difficult for Jodie Kidd because she's so tall? Has Anton finally got a decent partner, or will Craig Revel-Horwood's initial fears about Gillian Taylforth's lack of dancing ability be proved correct? And will anyone in the history of Strictly ever be as awesome as Alesha Dixon? </p> <p>Join me from <strong>6.30pm</strong> to find out!</p> <p><strong>6.30pm:</strong> Good evening, everybody, and welcome to week 2 of Strictly! I care not for Saturday night television up until September, when we're treated to a feast of titan talent shows, and then my excitement is palpable. I'm not keen on this Merlin business - I never thought I'd miss Robin Hood - but Strictly makes everything worthwhile. Tonight we're going to see the celebrity ladies with their wonderful male professional partners, and I am practically salivating with anticipation.</p> <p>I will confess here and now to a particular fondness for Anton du Beke, and every autumn I have a cursory investigative glance into the possibility of getting dancing lessons with him. Then I realise I'll just humiliate myself, and go back to talking about Strictly on the internet instead. So perhaps Anton will stumble over my homages to his ruling of all things ballroom, and then post a comment later? Who knows?</p> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> Here we go! Last week, our men fought it out on the dance floor, according to Tess. Phil Daniels and Flavia were kicked out after the dance-off. Who'll be next? This is Strictly Come Dancing - live!</p> <p>Titles!</p> <p>Here are Bruce and Tess, and shockingly, Tess is wearing another half-decent dress, albeit with some odd decorative buttons. Bruce makes another ham-fisted attempt at topical political humour, and then we meet the couples: Tom and Camilla; Jessie and Darren; Christine and Matthew; Don and Lilia; Lisa and Brendan; Austin and Erin; Jodie and Ian; Mark and Hayley; Heather and Brian; Gary and Karen; Gillian and Anton; John and Kristina; Rachel and Vincent; Andrew and Ola; Cherie and James.</p> <p><strong>6.52pm:</strong> Bruce introduces \"Jelly Wallace\". He doesn't appear to have noticed his slip-up, and then begins a private conversation with Bruno about crows' feet. Cut to Jessie's VT. She's worried about coming across as an idiot. Darren has his third partner from EastEnders, and hopes she'll live up to expectations. Jessie is enjoying dancing, and she wants her family and friends and her little girl to be proud of her.</p> <p>They take to the floor, resplendent in gold, and as hermionegingold pointed out, Jessie looks like she's auditioning to be Sally Bowles. They're salsaing to Hey Mambo, and she's certainly rhythmic and acting the dance well, but I fear the Technique Police will slaughter her for her legs and feet not being quite sharp enough.</p> <p>Bruce apologises for calling her \"Jelly\", saying, \"You were wobbling a bit in that dress.\" Ew. He welcomes the judges, making a joke on Bruno's name, who proceeds to bounce up and down in his chair. Head Judge Len Goodman says he thinks Jessie did a good job but she's thinking about the routine too much. Bruno calms himself down, and says, \"The salsa is like walking on the wild side, but I didn't quite see that.\" There's a bewildered silence. Craig admires the energy, but would like cleaner and more precise footwork, because it was heavy and laboured. Arlene agrees. Do I get a point for predicting that?</p> <p>Backstage, Jessie says she enjoyed it; Darren is proud of her. Scores: Craig 4, Arlene 4, Len 6, Bruno 6. Ouch. </p> <p><strong>7.01pm: </strong>Next to dance are Christine Bleakley and Matthew Cutler. Bruce is still trying to shoehorn in his \"I am not doddery, doddery I am....NOT!\" catchphrase which he has recently developed. Bruce, stop trying to make it happen. It's NOT going to happen.</p> <p>Christine is worried her dad will think her skirts are too short, and is intimidated by the brilliance of Alesha, which is reasonable, and the natural performing skills of Lisa and Jodie, and is just generally self-pitying.</p> <p>They take to the floor for their foxtrot to The Way You Look Tonight, and Christine has a pink and sparkly dress of the kind very much favoured by Strictly ladies. Her facial expression is very rabbit in the headlights, and she seems confused about where her head should be. Matt is singing to her. Bless.</p> <p>Len says it was beautiful; Bruno says it was ethereal; Craig says it was confident and well controlled, but she should finish her lines better; they start bickering about whether there is a problem with her frame or not; Arlene begins her evening of alliteration with the phrase \"coltish Christine\" and mounts her favourite hobby-horse of criticising people's arms.</p> <p>Christine says that Matthew is brilliant; Matthew says nothing. Scores - Craig 6, Arlene 6, Len 8, Bruno 7. For Pete's sake, Len. This is EXACTLY what happened last week - \"I had to give Austin a 9 because I gave Tom 8, and Austin was better.\" As Craig pointed out on <a href=\"http://strictlycomebitching.blogspot.com\">It Takes Two</a>, \"Well, start marking lower then.\" You leave yourself nowhere to go over the series, and that's why everyone ends up getting 10s in week three of Dancing with the Stars, when Len, Bruno and Carrie-Ann do exactly the same thing.</p> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> Lisa Snowdon is dancing with the self-proclaimed bad boy of ballroom Brendan Cole. They seem to be getting on well: \"His reputation is much worse than he is,\" she says; \"I consider myself to be a very lucky boy,\" is his view. Lisa has been having some kind of nervous breakdown in rehearsals through pure fear.</p> <p>Lisa looks beautiful in silver and black sequins, and they salsa to Rhythm is Gonna Get Ya. She's tentative and is going to get told to act it, and give in to the music more. </p> <p>Craig tells her she has natural rhythm, but that doesn't save it, because it was lacklustre; Arlene tells her the rhythm didn't really get her, and she needs to get down and dirty; Len says the spins were fantastic and we get sidetracked into a debate about what the correct terminology should be. When he reclaims his train of thought, he concludes, \"Good job.\" Bruno says she needs to get the juice, and stop being hesitant. Another point to me, I think. Scores - Craig 5, Arlene 5, Len 6, Bruno 6.</p> <p><strong>7.17pm: </strong>Jodie Kidd and Ian Waite, who are tall (we'll be reminded of that a lot later), are up next. Jodie VTs about playing polos with \"the Princes\", and then tells us that she's six foot two. Ian says his partner this year is even taller than the one he had last year. Jodie says she's the tallest female dancer ever on Strictly, and says she's six foot five in her heels. Ian says it's difficult to dance if you're tall. Jodie wants to prove that tall ladies can dance too. Seriously, people, if you're playing the Strictly Come Dancing drinking game, that's a whole half-dozen shots, right there.</p> <p>They're foxtrotting to I've Got The World On A String. Jodie looks good in hold, but the smile falters when she's left alone for two seconds. Arlene says it was elegant, though there was some dodgy footwork; Len says that tall girls can dance, and he was expecting her to be awkward, but it was light and a lovely effort; Bruno says the foxtrot requires the most control, and she did incredibly well, but she needs to pick the role she wants to perform while she's acting the routine; Craig says height magnifies all flaws, so that will be a problem for her, and he admires her high kicks.</p> <p>First from the Tess Daly Book of Inane Questions tonight - how is dancing different from doing catwalk modelling? Jodie says it is very different. Sigh. Scores - Craig 5, Arlene 6, Len 7, Bruno 7.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm: </strong>Time for some testosterone, and the training for the boys' merengue. John whirls Kristina round in ungainly fashion; Karen is unimpressed at boys' general laziness; Lilia is amazed at Don's gyrations; John is amusing about his own Latin limitations. </p> <p>Backstage, Tess is trying to engage people in conversation, but fails. She resorts to patting them on the shoulder in an attempt to endear herself to them. Andrew confesses that Ola is his boss and he does whatever he's told, and then Tess's imagination diverges into filth about Mark's swimming trunks.</p> <p><strong>7.29pm: </strong>Heather Small's family are huge Strictly fans and threatened to disown her if she didn't do the show, which I think is fair enough. She's partnered with new boy Brian Fortuna, who Claudia took a shine to on It Takes Two. Heather has genuine stage fright before she sings, and is even more terrified about dancing. </p> <p>She does look a bit serious backstage, but then we realise it's her salsa character, and she strikes a pose right by the judges' table, which pleases Len and Bruno no end. She sings her way through the routine (not sure what the song is), and is pouty and generally really quite fabulous and fierce. </p> <p>Bruno starts shouting, which is usually a good sign, and then says something about dancing and singing being a different part of the brain but the same thing; Craig says it was exciting but her feet should be closer together, and congratulates her on the neck-drop; Arlene does some finger-clicking and quotes \"Moving On Up\", advising her to sizzle; Len says, \"Clever Heather, queen of the salsa!\"</p> <p>Tess says Heather is the most nervous celebrity they've ever had on Strictly. Heather says she enjoyed it. Scores - Craig 5, Arlene 6, Len 8, Bruno 7.</p> <p><strong>7.36pm</strong>: Here's what we've all been waiting for - Gillian Taylforth and Anton du Beke. Gillian's scared of the judges; Anton says, \"I've danced in all six series; you think they'd let me win.\" She's finding the poise and posture tricky, but she's trying her best, and Anton says she's coming on wonderfully. But then Anton always says that.</p> <p>They foxtrot to Razzle Dazzle from the musical Chicago, and Gillian is wearing a foul yellow concoction with some kind of fruit motif. Her head is bobbing about and her smile is fixed, and I fear that among various possilble identifiable problems Arlene will criticise her arms and frame for going sloppy.</p> <p>Craig says it was rough around the edges, and there was some gapping, but it wasn't a complete disaster. Arlene says there was lots of fox but not enough trot, which is a horrible metaphor that she employed last series too. Len proclaims himself as man of the people who likes to say nice things, and says there was musicality, but he also suggests she tightens up her frame. Bruno says pretty much the same, adding, \"Compared to his other partners, you're Ginger Rogers.\"</p> <p>Gillian staggers backstage, and looks like she's about to cry. She's been having nightmares, and her son has been having nightmares on her behalf. Scores - Craig 4, Arlene 5, Len 7, Bruno 6. Anton kisses Gillian's hair, calls her \"gorgeous\" and declares that he would like to be next to Lisa. </p> <p><strong>7.44pm:</strong> The pocket-sized duo of Rachel Stevens and Vincent Simone dance next. \"Rachel is a gorgeous girl,\" says Vincent. \"She is my little princess.\" He flirts at her in a disgusting way during rehearsal, but fortunately she finds it amusing rather than scary.</p> <p>Rachel looks stunning in an aquamarine salsa dress, and they dance to a Latin version of Can't Buy Me Love. She's much more confident out of hold than any of the other female celebrities, and this is a very complex routine. </p> <p>Arlene was enthralled by the routine and wants Rachel to keep delivering; Len agrees with Arlene and throws his arm round her shoulders; Bruno growls at Rachel and draws some kind of ill-advised alcohol simile; Craig would have liked more rotation but thought it was amazing anyway. </p> <p>Tess asks her how she felt salsaing in front of her fiance. Vincent looks a bit surprised and says, \"Is he here? You should have told me!\" Scores - Craig 7, Arlene 8, Len 8, Bruno 8.</p> <p><strong>7.51pm: </strong>Bruce tells us that Cherie Lunghi once played the female lead in Oliver Twist - \"That's the last thing we need on this show - another Nancy.\" Ha. Ha. She's dancing with James Jordan, who thinks that she is very sexy for an older lady. He kind of deserves her stamping and swivelling on his toes all the time, which she does with no compunction whatsoever.</p> <p>They're foxtrotting to Sweet About Me, and Cherie has been sewn into a horrid lime-green dress with curtain-like swagging. That notwithstanding, she looks quite natural in hold, not suffering from the bobbing-head syndrome that affects the novices, and when they do a step routine in parallel, she seems confident and sharp.</p> <p>Bruno tells her she is a leading lady; Craig says she's a class act; Arlene says she'll give the rugby-playing motor car a run for his money; Len liked everything apart from James's hair, declaring it the best dance of the night. Scores - Craig 8, Arlene 8, Len 9, Bruno 8.</p> <p>So they go top of the leaderboard, and Jessie and Darren are rooted to the foot of the table. Now as a special treat, the celebrity men and their partners perform a group merengue to Ricky Martin's She Bangs. John Sergeant is a beat behind in the entire first section until Kristina takes him in hold. Don and Lilia are having a terrific time and look excellent; Andrew looks scared, possibly of Ola; Gary and Karen don't look too bad at all; Hayley's desperation for Mark to dance in a more aggressive fashion makes more sense watching this, because she seems like she's leading him in their solo spot. Interestingly, Austin looks much less comfortable in this than he did last week, and Tom and Camilla get very little to do in terms of a solo indeed.</p> <p>Craig was obviously paying close attention to Tom, as he admires his hip action; Arlene says Austin has improved since last week. So maybe it was just the camera-work that made it look not so hot. Len says Mark looked a bit awkward, but everyone was good. Bruno says that John was his favourite. Dermot Murnaghan is nodding in the audience, mouthing, \"Absolutely right.\" Bruno continues to babble on, but the applause drowns him out.</p> <p>That's it for this evening, and the phone-lines are open. The results show is aired tomorrow at 8pm, and I'll be here to update you then. Until then, goodnight!</p> <p><strong>Results show</strong></p> <p><strong>8pm:</strong> We're back in the ballroom, and I have fixed my own technical problems, because I am clearly a genius. Now watch the interweb break.</p> <p>Last night, there was much hyperbole; tonight, one lady and her partner must leave. This is Strictly Come Dancing!</p> <p>We welcome back the celebs, their partners, and Bruce and Tess, who is in a purple contraption that seems to be far too low cut for decency. There's a recap of the rules, like we don't know what they are. Later we will see former champion Jill Halfpenny dance with Darren Bennett, and the Sugababes will perform.</p> <p>But before that, there's lots of filler to get through, and we have a recap of last night. Random people giving their opinions on the performances include Roger Lloyd Pack, Jemma Kidd, and Heather Small's fella, who declares her \"totally awesome\". Nobody from S Club, sadly. Would have liked to know what Bradley thought of it. However, fans of Alesha's nans may be interested to know that Rachel too has a gran who is devoted to her granddaughter and will be floor-side all series.</p> <p>Bruce talks to the judges. Arlene mispronounces her words, and Craig laughs at her, but pretends he's not. Len enthuses over Heather's salsa. Bruno is rude about Anton's dance partners prior to Gillian. </p> <p><strong>8.17pm:</strong> VTs about our new pros, Brian, Kristina and Hayley. Kristina is excited about dancing with John; Brian specialises in street salsa, whatever that might be, and is delighted to be part of the original show rather than the US spin-off; and Hayley goes out with an All Black. They dance to Walk This Way.</p> <p>Now Jill and Darren are reunited to show us how the jive is done, with their championship-winning routine to I'm Still Standing. Jill's hair is half in a ponytail and half hanging down, and looks bizarre; also, her dress doesn't really fit. It's still a great dance, though. Jill's advice on the jive - wear a good sports bra. Not a lot of help to the chaps who'll be dancing it next week. Backstage, Gary Rhodes says he's inspired by Jill and Darren; Cherie talks herself and her abilities down; if required to dance off, Jessie will do her best and enjoy it.</p> <p>Time for our pros to show us how the tango is done, to the strains of Beat It. Ola's hair is all in her mouth, so it's just as well that James is such a strong leader. I love when the pros have their serious passionate dancing faces on. Andrew Castle says his tango will be nothing like that, because he only has six days to sort it out. Tess does some embarrassing patronising flirting with John Sergeant.</p> <p><strong>8.31pm:</strong> VT of the celebrity gentlemen talking about next week's routines, complete with gratuitous Mark Foster bottom-shaking. Back in the ballroom, Bruce is talking to actress Sally Lindsay, who is supporting Christine, and Dermot Murnaghan, who is supporting \"Gentleman John Sergeant\". Then we get to see the boys' group merengue again. I shall be looking out for Tom's hip action, as noted by the judges last night. Head Judge Len says that if practice doesn't make perfect, it makes it different, and says that Mark has improved since last night. Except it's not really last night, is it?</p> <p>Before we get into the results, we have the Sugababes singing Girls, with accompanying dance routine from Kristina and Brian, James and Ola, and Vincent and Flavia. After that's over, we finally get down to what we're all here for - the moment of truth. In no particular order, the couples definitely back next week are: Rachel and Vincent; Jessie and Darren; Heather and Brian; Cherie and James; Christine and Matthew; Lisa and Brendan.</p> <p>So it's Gillian and Anton and Jodie and Ian to dance off. Len says he's disappointed that it's two of the foxtrot couples in the bottom two, because it's such a challenging dance, and gives his usual useful advice of \"do what I told you earlier, and enjoy it\".</p> <p>Over to the judges. Craig says he will save the most dynamic couple - Jodie and Ian. Arlene will save Jodie and Ian because of their spectacular improvement. Bruno says it is incredible to see someone take on board comments so quickly, and he too saves Jodie and Ian. That's <strong>Gillian and Anton</strong> out, then.</p> <p>Thus poor Anton is out in week two - the first week of ladies' competition. Bruce says nobody deserves to go, and Gillian apologises to Anton. Aw. He tells her she was a joy to be with, and they go off to the centre of the floor for their final dance to We've Only Just Begun, which is a bit cruel. Until next week - keep dancing!</p>",

Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PAUL J RICHARDS/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Ladies, gentlemen, and mavericks who accept neither designation: welcome to the first presidential debate of the general election! And what a wild ride it's been to get here, thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/us/politics/27debatecnd.html?hp\">unpredictable behaviour </a>of a certain war hero. Actually, the wild ride continues \u2014 here's the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/mccain-pool-report-5/\">pooled press report </a>from a few hours ago: \"McCain now boarding plane at DCA [Washington's National Airport]... Heading to Memphis, 1:50 minute flight, then motorcade to site. General atmosphere is utter confusion.\" At the Guardian's Election Headquarters, though (think flashing lights, humming banks of computers, analysts monitoring 24/7 info-feeds) we'll be cutting through the confusion with a liveblog, beginning here shortly before the debate itself at <strong>9pm eastern</strong> (2am UK time; watch the debate in the UK on BBC News Channel, Freeview 080).</p> <p>Don't forget to prepare your Debate Drinking Game: you have <a href=\"http://radaronline.com/features/2008/09/presidential_debates_barack_obama_john_mccain_01.php\">various</a> different <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-nelson/the-presidential-debate-d_b_129609.html\">options</a>. Rather than downing a shot every time McCain says \"my friends\" in a sinister fashion, or when Obama says \"as I've said before\" just prior to a major policy U-turn, my unit of consumption, I'm afraid, will be <a href=\"http://www.sierranevada.com/\">sips of Sierra Nevada, </a>because I feel some vague responsibility to stay marginally sober for a while. I'll abandon this policy upon the 30th mention of the word \"change\", and switch to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylated_spirit\">meths</a>. Join me! The Guardian is not responsible for your alcohol poisoning.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm </strong>(all times eastern): There was always going to be a huge amount at stake tonight; we're expecting the biggest TV audience ever for a presidential debate. But McCain has <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/_john_mccain_has_more.php\">upped the stakes</a> massively. By agreeing to debate before finalising a bailout deal, it looked like he'd blinked; he needs a \"win\" tonight if he's to erase the air of hair-trigger rashness hanging over his campaign. So he's left with something to prove, even though the subject-matter \u2014 national security and foreign policy \u2014 is supposed to be his strongest suit. (He also needs to keep his notorious tetchiness in check: it'll be fascinating to see if Obama, a far cooler customer, tries in subtle ways to wind him up.) </p> <p>Obama's challenges are more longstanding. The conventional wisdom is that he needs to persuade America he'd make a credible commander-in-chief: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/us/politics/26poll.html\">most voters still prefer McCain</a> for that role. Like McCain, he has a reputation as a not-particularly-good debater; Obama's fault is a tendency to longwindedness and condescension. More voters <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2008/09/26/oh-the-expectations-theyll-set-11/\">expect Obama to outperform McCain</a> \u2014 but that, of course, only sets the expectations so as to reward McCain if he does minimally well.</p> <p><strong>The venue</strong> for the debate is the stately Mississippi town of Oxford \u2014 specifically the campus of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi\">University of Mississippi</a>, once the scene of anti-desegregation riots. <strong>The audience</strong> includes many students and faculty, who apparently <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/No_love_at_Ole_Miss.html\">aren't pleased</a> with McCain's recent antics. <strong>The moderator</strong> tonight is kindly, almond-eyed 74-year-old newscaster <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/aboutus/bio_lehrer.html\">Jim Lehrer</a>, who has moderated 10 of these debates already \u2014 more than anyone else. (He'll almost certainly ask a question or two about the economy.) As for <strong>the format</strong>: the 90-minute event will be divided into nine segments of nine minutes each, but exactly what happens in each one is unclear: the Obama campaign lawyer who helped negotiate the arrangement has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Barnett_Unprecedented_freeform_debate_format.html\">described it</a> as \"unprecedented\". In the first four minutes, Lehrer will ask a question of each of the candidates, and they'll reply, but the remaining five minutes are at Lehrer's discretion. That part could even involve the candidates debating each other directly. </p> <p>OK, I'm opening the Sierra Nevada now. Stand by...</p> <p><strong>8.56pm</strong> Lehrer is explaining his plans for the night to the audience. \"No cellphones!... You all can talk among yourselves until I say hush, and that'll give you a few seconds to chill out.\" Jeez, OK. </p> <p><strong>9.00pm</strong> Here we go! As you can see from the picture, Lehrer faces the podiums (podia?), which are at right-angles to each other. (Jim Lehrer always looks a bit naturally startled to me, but I don't think he is, really. It's just his eyes.) \"Tonight will primarily be about national security and foreign policy, which... includes global finance.\" Ah, clever. Obama and McCain enter and shake hands. Obama has his hand out first, and gets to grab McCain's forearm. Crucial dominant body language, according to some psychology book I once read.</p> <p><strong>9.02pm</strong> \"At this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?\" Obama lays out his plan and goes straight for the punch, condemning \"failed policies... supported by Senator McCain.\" That didn't take long. </p> <p>McCain: \"I do have a sad note tonight, Senator Kennedy is in the hospital tonight...\" Feel the bipartisanship! (This is true. And sad. But McCain <em>always does this</em>.) He seems out-of-breath, but that's because he RACED IN from Washington. He sings the praises of the deal he didn't actually broker and that hasn't actually been brokered yet. \"Debate each other!\" Lehrer suggests now.</p> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong> They really don't want to debate each other. Lehrer just made Obama repeat a line about McCain \u2014 and his \"fundamentals\" line from a few days back \u2014 to McCain directly. \"Are you worried I couldn't hear it?\" McCain says. Lehrer is a rather strange man, I think.</p> <p><strong>9.14pm</strong> Lehrer: \"Are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead the country out of this?\" Now McCain, railing against pork-barrel spending, is waving a felt-tip pen around -- \"this one's kind of an old one\" -- which he says he'd use to \"veto every spending bill\" that passed across his desk. Obama responds by pointing out that earmarking doesn't count for much government spending, compared to tax breaks for the wealthy. Also \u2014 what a rubbish pen. </p> <p>\"I was called 'the Sheriff',\" McCain says, chuckling, as part of an incredibly rambling answer about earmarking. I don't think anyone else laughed. Obama interrupts a McCain riff about how raising taxes is bad. \"I don't know where John's getting his figures... When you look at your tax policies, you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, and that is a continuation of the last eight years.\" He's not holding back on that theme.</p> <p>DRINK! \"2,000, <em>my friends,</em> 2,000!\" \u2014 it's something to do with earmarks, of course, it always is.</p> <p>More on taxes. \"A lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of 'rich',\" says McCain. According to scientists, that was the most foolish thing McCain could possibly say, since the only \"definition of rich\" anyone can remember was McCain's $5m-a-year definition. </p> <p><strong>9.25pm</strong>: A testy exchange on taxes. They're interrupting each other every few seconds now, accusing each other of not telling the truth. When McCain tries but fails to interrupt, he smiles thinly and chuckles. This is not advisable. Now we're onto another bailout question. What will you have to give up, as president, to pay for the bailout plan? Obama talks... and talks... McCain: \"Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the Senate. It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.\" McCain smiles at his own joke; Obama gives a hilariously small and patronising chuckle, as if to spare McCain's blushes.</p> <p><strong>9.32pm</strong>: Obama just called McCain 'Tom', by \"accident\". Later he will call him 'Whatever-your-name-is,' or maybe 'Bernard'. Lehrer's getting testy at the two candidates' refusal to admit that they'll have no money left to do anything when they get into office, because Wall Street has collapsed and soon the money system will be suspended anyway and we will all have to start living in treehouses, scavenging for scraps.</p> <p><strong>Scorecard so far:</strong> Barack Obama is winning if you measure by substantiveness of answers. John McCain is winning if you count number of years spent in a Vietnamese jail.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Election's over; John McCain just made the same joke twice in the same debate. \"I wasn't nominated Miss Congeniality in the Senate,\" he says. This wasn't funny the first time. Oh, and: DRINK! Twice. \"I'm a maverick of the Senate, and I'm proud to say I've got a maverick with me\" as running-mate. Yet McCain is a maverick, I note, who's not wearing a flag-pin tonight \u2014 unlike secret Muslim Barack Obama. Interesting...</p> <p>And now we're onto foreign policy at last: Iraq. \"John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007; the war started in 2003...\" \u2014 a long and punchy litany of McCain's smoke-and-mirrors rhetoric on the war, probably Obama's best performance so far tonight. Strange, seeing as how he's supposed to be better on the economy. </p> <p>McCain is lecturing Obama now on the difference between strategy and tactics, and how Obama \"did the incredible thing of voting to cut off funding for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" Obama's responds well \u2014 not too law-professory: both senators have voted against troop funding in certain contexts, he points out, because of disputes over whether or not to endorse a timetable for troop withdrawal.</p> <p><strong>9.49pm</strong>: They're completely talking over each other now. It's like BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p><strong>9.54pm</strong>: Pakistan. McCain is chastising Obama for threatening air strikes in public. That area hasn't been governed since the days of Alexander the Great, he points out, days McCain presumably remembers only too well. Obama says he hasn't threatened air strikes on Pakistan, and reminds the audience that McCain's recommendation of foreign-policy sobriety doesn't sit well with the fact that he \"sings songs about bombing Iran.\" Ouch.</p> <p>Now. Let's address the matter of the 'audience reaction monitor', rolling along the bottom of the screen on CNN's feed. It's like a heart monitor, and it's designed to show the responses of groups of Republican, Democratic and Independent voters, to whom CNN, presumably, jhas given electronic dials. The problem is that it's always basically flat. When McCain talks, Republicans like it slightly more; when Obama talks, Democrats like it more. But basically it's flat. This tells us nothing about anything at all.</p> <p>...Oh, but the Republicans with their dials do love McCain talking about all the mothers of troops he's met. The candidates are battling over the bracelets they wear from the mothers of deceased servicemen. Hmm. \"I have a bracelet too!\" says Obama. I don't.</p> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong>: Iran. \"Let's have some straight talk,\" says McCain -- DRINK!, surely -- outlining his plan for a \"league of democracies\" that would impose sanctions on Iran. But overall the exchanges seem pretty evenly matched. Now McCain is talking about Obama's willingness to talk to America's enemies without precondition. He makes a big deal about stumbling on the pronunciation of 'Ahmedinejad' -- deliberately, I thought...? Obama responds that one of McCain's advisors, Henry Kissinger, recently endorsed the idea of speaking to Iran, but the rest of his explanation of the definition of \"preconditions\" for diplomatic contacts is pretty convoluted. Or maybe I've just had too much Sierra Nevada?</p> <p><strong>10.13pm</strong>: Obama gets in a nice zinger about McCain's weird Spain gaffe last week, but then McCain rouses himself and delivers probably his punchiest passage so far, repeatedly suggesting that Obama's approach is \"dangerous\". McCain waxes deeply sarcastic about the notion of Obama meeting Ahmedinejad and telling him off for wanting to \"wipe Israel off the map\", and Obama doesn't get his comeback in fast enough before Lehrer moves the discussion on. Advantage McCain, in purely political terms, I think...</p> <p><strong>10.20pm</strong>: And so to Russia. As Wikipedia notes in comments, we're going to have to start drinking every time McCain accuses Obama of not understanding something. Obama doesn't understand the Russia/Georgia situation, he says \u2014 but surprisingly, after being mocked on the very point by Obama, he decided to repeat his very, very odd remark about looking into Vladimir Putin's eyes and seeing the letters KGB. Putin wears shades most of the time anyway, doesn't he? Probably to cover up the embarrassing fact that he's got letters written on his eyes.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong>: A clash on energy independence and alternative energy. Much interruption. McCain has started grinning broadly; Obama's doing it too now, as they both object to each other's claim that the other objected to alternative fuels. If you see what I mean.</p> <p><strong>10.27pm</strong>: Likelihood of another 9/11 attack? McCain: \"Much less likely than the day after 9/11, but we're a long way from safe.\" Obama: \"I think we are safer in some ways\" \u2014 securing airports, etcetera \u2014 \"but we have a long way to go.\" More \"Obama doesn't understand\" from McCain. His contempt for Obama is tangible \u2014 he can't look him in the eye, and sneers while he's speaking \u2014 but it makes for an undeniably strong performance. They're competing for the last word now.</p> <p>\"There are some advantages to experience and knowledge, and I don't think Obama has the experience... we've seen this stubbornness before, in this administration\" \u2014 McCain is accusing Obama of being too close to Bush. We live in interesting times. </p> <p>Obama tells a story about his Kenyan father's faith in the American dream, and how America isn't viewed in the same way around the world now as it was then. Some people will say that this means he hates America. McCain: \"When I came home from prison...\" Drink. He seems close to tears as he talks about helping veterans and \"healing the wounds of war.\"</p> <p>...Aaaand that's it. McCain gets the last word, but not in a particularly thunderous or resounding way. The two men shake hands, greet their wives, then shake hands with each others' wives, and then kindly, almond-eyed Jim Lehrer shakes various hands too.</p> <p>Well. This was clearly a much better night for McCain than many were expecting; after an unremarkable start, he appeared to find his ground on foreign policy, and delivered significantly more damaging blows to Obama than vice-versa; Obama missed too many opportunities, and was maybe too generous in many of his replies. Then again, various TV pundits are right now hotly debating the notion that McCain's dripping contempt for Obama -- and his strange, nervous grinning and chuckling, like some kind of chuckling maverick -- looked unpresidential, while the Democrat looked the part pretty much all the way through. Both of these arguments are clearly true. Which one triumphs?</p> <p>A win for McCain, I'd say, especially given the expectations. But not a decisive one, or a knockout, by any means. But what do I know? I've drunk a whole third of one bottle of Sierra Nevada.</p> <p><strong>11.36pm</strong>: ...Actually, just before I go: in <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/09/26/politics/horserace/entry4482028.shtml\">a CBS instant poll of uncommitted voters</a>, 40% awarded the debate to Obama, 22% to McCain, the rest thought it was a draw. So don't let anyone tell you it was a win for McCain yet -- like, say, I just did.</p> <p>Thanks for reading and commenting; keep going...</p> <p>UPDATE, SATURDAY MORNING: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/27/debate.poll/?iref=hpmostpop\">More evidence</a> from a CNN instant poll to contradict my initial post-debate hunch that the relentlessness of McCain's attacks last night would leave him with the upper hand. It finds Obama in front. A CNN pollster explains: \"It can be reasonably concluded, especially after accounting for the slight Democratic bias in the survey, that we witnessed a tie in Mississippi tonight. But given the direction of the campaign over the last couple of weeks, a tie translates to a win for Obama.\"</p>"
