  "<p>There's an air of wait-and-see quiet amongst America's political pundits and analysts today -- an atmosphere that's almost relaxed, now there's little more to be said -- but Marc Ambinder has at least made a good list of all the things that we're waiting to see about. From his catalogue of \"the known unknowns\" about Tuesday's vote:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The Obama turnout machine (size, scope)<br>2. Racism<br>3. Secret Republican Obama Admirers (The Goodbye To All That Effect)<br>...<br>5. Whether people assume Obama will win and therefore don't feel compelled to vote for him (the Democratic overconfident effect)<br>...<br>7. The pro-or-anti-Palin vote (suburban women, jazzed conservative base)<br>8. The Bradley effect (whites lying to pollsters and saying they have NO opinion when they actually support the white candidate)<br>9. The Wilder effect (whites lying about supporting the black candidate)</p> </blockquote> <p>... And something called the Howard Dean Red Cap effect. (Why am I only just learning about new \"effects\" at this stage in the game?) Meanwhile, Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=known_uknowns\">predicts</a> a bigger-than-usual discrepancy between Obama's popular vote and his electoral college totals, because of all the Democrats in blue states who might not usually bother voting, but who want to be able to say they voted for the first black president.</p> <p>At MSNBC, Chuck Todd's final electoral map of the race gives Obama <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/11/02/1626684.aspx \">a 286-157 lead over McCain</a>: Obama could lose all the states Todd still lists as toss-ups -- Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Florida and Ohio -- and still come out the winner. Nate Silver <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-112-afternoon-edition.html\">detects a very small amount of tightening</a> in the polls.</p> <p>David Ignatius pauses to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/11/the_presidential_x_factor.html\">look back at</a> John F Kennedy's first year in office, reminding us that it was essentially an unmitigated disaster:</p> <blockquote> <p>A world of problems awaited him, and his inexperience showed. The CIA talked him into the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. The Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, intimidated him at the Vienna summit and then erected the Berlin Wall. JFK discovered that the world was far more complicated than his campaign rhetoric had implied. The candidate who wins Tuesday will face a similar reality check...</p> </blockquote> <p>But as Joe Klein <a href=\"http://swampland.blogs.time.com/2008/11/02/sunday-before-the-day/\">points out</a>, Kennedy's approval ratings were undimmed. Why?</p> <blockquote> <p>Because Kennedy changed the American zeitgeist. He was a rebirth of American youth and vigor--or, as he pronounced, vigah--after a very hard midcentury slog. His arrival announced the coming of age of a new America: where most people owned their own homes, where a much larger number of people went to college, where the prejudices of the past regarding race and sex--and eventually sexual orientation--had no future. He embodied the return of prosperity, optimism and idealism (a bit too idealistic and optimistic, in fact--in Vietnam). He changed the way the world looked at America, and changed the way we looked at ourselves. He inspired my generation to join the Peace Corps, march for civil rights, get involved in politics. The nation became more adventurous, bolder, sexier, more prosperous and more powerful. It seems to me that if Barack Obama wins, there will be similar changes--similar in impact, if not in content. Obama's arrival may mean the beginning of yet another new America. </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The UK has a very real problem with websites that incite terrorism, and if we are not careful the government's preferred cure could be as bad as the disease itself. Faced with the impossibility of policing material that originates from abroad, the home secretary is now planning to appoint herself the UK's first official censor.</p> <p>In 2006, the government passed a <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060011_en_2#pt1-pb1-l1g1\">law</a> banning the display of material that \"directly or indirectly\" encouraged terrorism.</p> <p>\"Direct encouragement\" is easy to spot. It includes virtually all website that urge true believers to \"kill the infidel\". Not, however, a site featuring <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=1uwOL4rB-go\">Achmed, the dead terrorist</a>, as that is clearly satire. \"Indirect\" is a little harder to pin down. Apparently this is \"glorification of the commission or preparation\" of certain acts, together with a nudge that such acts would be a good idea right now. </p> <p>If you do come across incitement to terrorism on the internet, report it to your nearest police constable. They will then issue the \"relevant person\" with a \"take-down\" notice: and in quaint British fashion, the site must be down within two working days, excluding Christmas or Good Friday, but not including Eid. Or else.</p> <p>An eternal difficulty with such legislation is that \"one person's terrorist is someone else's freedom fighter\". The law may be outwardly neutral: but it is focussed pretty exclusively on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/alqaida-terrorism-internet\">muslim terrorism</a>. You won't find many web sites that glorify western covert ops being reported or closed down.</p> <p>Or to put it another way: \"Lyrical Terrorist\", Samima Malik was first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/08/terrorism.world\">found guilty</a>, then cleared, of inciting terrorism through poetry. It seems unlikely in the extreme that our laws would ever be used against the freelance anti-terrorism websites \u2013 mostly US-based \u2013 that wage a constant, possibly illegal and sometimes seriously unpleasant citizens' war against the \"axis of evil\".</p> <p>I also know, or hope I know, that the decision to close a site will not be left in the hands of humble beat officers, who have after all, previously arrested wearers of anti-Blair t-shirts for \"offensiveness\". That said, I'm not sure I trust more senior policemen either. After all, it was an officer with the met's obscene publications unit who leant on satirical site \"<a href=\"http://www.guarana.org/totc/\">thinkofthechildren</a>\" on the grounds it \"could\" incite violence. There's a weasel word, if ever there was one: so many things \"could\" glorify terrorism.</p> <p>Sadly, this only catches UK-hosted websites, which are a small proportion of the whole: the most prolific inciters of terrorism lie well beyond the reach of the most dedicated UK copper. This is a biased law, but it's also a figleaf: a symptom of government pretending that something can be done.</p> <p>Yet government now wishes to do more. Recently, the home office informed me that \"the government has been working \u2026 to develop filtering software [to protect] against illegal material that promotes or encourages terrorism\".</p> <p>However, just because the home secretary doesn't like something doesn't make it \"illegal\". In fact, \"illegal\" material doesn't actually exist, at least, not as such. Terrorism material, in British Law, is defined largely \u2013 albeit not exclusively \u2013 by the intent of the person possessing it. The Catholic church may once have possessed an index of banned books: we do not.</p> <p>There is altogether too much of the lynch mob about this proposal: to go after the devil, we'd happily chop down every law in the land to do so. Is that really what we expect from one of the most senior ministers in the land?</p> <p>Herein lies the real risk from terrorism. It's all very well arguing that terrorism sites are pernicious, evil, etc. But what the home office is doing is equally dangerous. Substituting police opinion for due process may be operationally efficient: but it is an erosion of legality.</p> <p>Replacing a properly enacted power to block banned sites with a filtering process that will permit the home secretary to censor by executive fiat strikes at the core of civil liberties in this country.</p> <p>Terrorism is serious stuff; so too are some of its remedies.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama entered the final hours of the longest and most expensive election campaign in American history in an upbeat mood today, voicing Democratic confidence when he said the party has a \"righteous wind at our back\".</p> <p>Obama's campaign team predicted he would break the traditional pattern of US politics to take long-established Republican states. The RealClearPolitics average put Obama on 50% to rival John McCain's 43%, a lead that, if replicated in Tuesday's election, would produce a landslide.</p> <p>The McCain camp came out in force too today to argue that the Republican was still in contention, and that it would be a mistake to write him off. \"What we are in for is a slam bang finish,\" McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, predicted.</p> <p>Nearly two years after it began, the closing 72 hours of the epic battle between Obama and McCain saw both camps making an exhaustive effort to win over the diminishing camp of undecided voters, and get the faithful to the polls.</p> <p>In a last blitz of battleground states, Obama returned to the promise of a new kind of politics that has defined his campaign. </p> <p>\"If you give me your vote on Tuesday, we won't just win this election \u2014 together, we will change this country and change the world,\" Obama said in the Democrats' national radio address.</p> <p>After defeat in the 2000 and 2004 elections, the Democrats, buoyed by polls numbers, were increasingly prepared to abandon the nervous hesitation about voicing in public their hopes that they were finally on the verge of victory. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer told CBS television: \"Wednesday morning Dems are going to be very happy.\"</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, was also optimistic, telling CBS he was cheered by the surge in early voting which favoured Democrats. \"The edge is pretty substantial in our favour,\" Axelrod said.</p> <p>In Colorado, a once-Republican state where Obama now leads, some 46% of the electorate have turned out for early voting. North Carolina, an even more strongly Republican state, is also showing heavy early voting in favour of the Democrat.</p> <p>\"We feel good,\" Axelrod said. \"It is not just the polls. It is the early voting ... These figures are are coming in strong for us, reversing the traditional patterns.\" </p> <p>The Obama campaign manager, David Plouffe, said it had deployed a record number of volunteers over the weekend to knock on doors trying to get supporters to the polls on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Republicans, while admitting the odds were against stacked against them, insisted McCain will close the gap in the final hours. \"John's a closer. He always has been,\" Fred Thompson, the Law and Order star and former rival for the White House, told NBC television. ''He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I think the election has yet to be decided.\"</p> <p>However, last minute polls provided little evidence to support Davis's claim that the race was tightening. McCain has been behind Obama in all of the more than 250 polls conducted since late September.</p> <p>Karl Rove, who masterminded Bush's campaign in 2000 and 2004, was less optimistic than the McCain team's public pronouncements. McCain has \"a very steep hill to climb\", Rove told Fox.</p> <p>McCain has so far kept his promise - in spite of pressure from some of his advisers and his running mate Sarah Palin - not to make race an issue by using tapes of Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright.</p> <p>The Republican party today paid for a series of robocalls - taped phone messages - in key states quoting Hillary Clinton from when she stood against Obama for the Democratic nomination, saying he was inexperienced and the White House was no place for \"on the job training\".</p> <p>McCain's team, outspent in advertising by Obama almost every day since the campaign formally began early in September, said in an email to supporters today it would match him on the eve of election. \"In the final days of the campaign, our television presence will be bigger and broader than the Obama campaign's presence.\" The McCain camp said it would outspend Obama by $10m in the coming hours. </p> <p>McCain devoted most of his final hours trying to shore up support in traditionally Republicans states. While he held an event today in Pennsylvania - his main Democratic target on Tuesday - the Republican was also forced to return to states that had been in the Republican fold in 2004.</p> <p>His itinerary before polling day called for trips to Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and even Tennessee, with a last swing through the Rocky mountain states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico before returning to his home in Arizona late tonight/Monday.</p> <p>Obama, meanwhile, held a rally on Saturday in Springfield, Missouri, one of the mostly staunchly conservative corners of a state won comfortably by George Bush in 2004. </p> <p>He was campaigning in Ohio today, with appearances in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. After stops tomorrow in Florida and North Carolina, he plans to end his campaign with a huge rally in northern Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that is one of his top targets on Tuesday.</p>",

  "<p>Substitute Ricardo Gardner eased the pressure on under-fire Bolton manager Gary Megson with a goal and an assist to lift his side off the bottom of the Premier League table.</p> <p>The Jamaican international replaced the injured Mustapha Riga shortly before half-time against Manchester City at the Reebok Stadium and applied the finishing touch to a wicked low cross from Gretar Steinsson in the 77th minute.</p> <p>It was the Trotters' first goal for five hours and 50 minutes and Gardner then turned provider by crossing low for City skipper Richard Dunne to put through his own goal with two minutes remaining. Victory breathed new life into Bolton's faltering campaign but will have piled pressure on City manager Mark Hughes.</p> <p>For Megson - who was verbally abused by his own supporters in the two previous matches - the relief was immense and he could not fault his players' effort or desire throughout in a largely forgettable encounter. A chronic lack of firepower has undermined Bolton's efforts all season but this success was chiselled on obstinate defending, excellent goalkeeping from Jussi Jaaskelainen and Gardner's outstanding personal contribution.</p> <p>City, for their part, offered precious little and Mark Hughes' men have now won just once in six league games and remain as inconsistent as ever. Robinho showed plenty of glimpses of quality but the Brazilian and his team-mates could find no way past Jaaskelainen, who made at least three saves of the highest quality.</p> <p>Bolton were without club-record signing Johan Elmander due to a groin injury and Kevin Davies was asked to plough a lone furrow up front. The crowd again fell several thousand below capacity, the swathes of empty seats a reflection of the Trotters' struggles but City supporters also failed to come close to selling their ticket allocation.</p> <p>Those who had bothered to turn up at least got to watch Robinho in the flesh and he showed plenty of early promise with some delightful footwork and acute awareness of players around him. The Brazilian magician was deployed just behind Evans but frequently drifted out to the left flank in a bid to collect possession.</p> <p>He did that in the sixth minute, with almost devastating consequences for Bolton. Gliding his way infield from the left, Robinho hit a ferocious, dipping right-foot shot which flew narrowly over Jaaskelainen's crossbar. It was a warning sign to Bolton but the hosts were undaunted and quickly gained a foothold on proceedings. In the 22nd minute, Fabrice Muamba then tried his luck from 30 yards but his rising shot flew harmlessly over Joe Hart's goal.</p> <p>Robinho remained City's most potent attacking weapon and he chipped a delightful pass behind the Bolton defence and into Shaun Wright-Phillips' path in the 27th minute. The England winger showed neat control and hooked a left-footed cross into the danger zone but the delivery was all too easily cleared.</p> <p>City carved out the most clear-cut chance in the 41st minute when Evans' neat pass cut Bolton to pieces and gave Stephen Ireland a clear run of goal, but Jaaskelainen raced off his line to smother the midfielder's low shot. Bolton replaced Riga with Gardner shortly before the interval after the Dutchman took a knock following a heavy challenge from Dunne.</p> <p>But Jaaskelainen was forced into another fine parried save on the stroke of half-time when he denied Evans after the Welshman was put clear by Wright-Phillips, who then headed straight at the goalkeeper after the ball was played back into the danger zone. City sought to up the tempo after the restart and in the 51st minute Wright-Phillips embarked on a fine run, cutting in from the left flank and engineering the space to thrash a left-foot shot over the crossbar.</p> <p>The visitors went far closer in the 57th minute when Robinho found the space to turn past Steinsson and plant a neat right-foot shot which required another fine save from Jaaskelainen. While Bolton's quality was questionable, their spirit was not in doubt and in the 62nd minute Hart denied Kevin Nolan with a brave close-range save before referee Mike Riley waved away appeals for a penalty following Dunne's clumsy challenge on Matty Taylor.</p> <p>The breakthrough finally arrived with 13 minutes remaining when Nolan's astute pass sent Steinsson clear down the right flank. He whipped in a brilliant low cross which Gardner fired in left-footed off the underside of the crossbar. The goal poured confidence into Megson's players and victory was assured minutes from time when Gardner crossed low from the left and the hapless Dunne fired the ball into his own from six yards.</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner were quick to fly to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/01/david-miliband-talks-kinshasa-congo\">Kinshasa and Kigali</a> this weekend to be seen to be responding to the sudden visibility of the long-running horrible humanitarian crisis of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Whether they achieve much more than another temporary truce among the assorted warlords whose troops have been living by rape and pillage in the area for more than a decade, is of course another question. </p> <p>But Mr Miliband and Mr Kouchner have another invisible humanitarian crisis on their hands in which some highly publicised flying around could have a dramatic effect on the ground. They should announce visits to Jerusalem to speak to Israel's leaders, and then arrive by helicopter (the airport is destroyed) in Gaza City, breaking the Israel military's 17-month siege of Gaza.</p> <p>They would be able to do it with ease, unlike the handful of people who made the trip recently in two boat trips from Cyprus, bringing medicines, hearing aids for the deaf, and hope that the world could hear the horror of what is happening to them. </p> <p>The two European leaders could see for themselves in Gaza how Israel's collective punishment of 1.5 million people has crippled Gaza's economy, cut fuel and electricity, leaving its desperate people hungry, deprived of medicines, with hundreds barred from travelling for operations or healthcare, or for education. Only last week, camps in Gaza City and Khan Yunis saw waist-high water <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3614488,00.html\">flood homes and roads</a> after heavy rains because the pumping system was not working. </p> <p>All this suffering is there to be seen. </p> <p>And they could hear about the many avoidable deaths, and learn the names of men from 77 to 21 who died at Erez checkpoint when their permits were delayed, and about children, like one-year-old Bayyam Abu Hilu, who died at home when she was denied a permit \"for security reasons\".</p> <p>They would hear how underlying these realities the mental health needs of every family \u2013 particularly for children \u2013 are overwhelming. </p> <p>Last weekend I was among about 100 foreigners due to arrive in Gaza for a medical conference on the impact of siege on mental health. The World Health Organisation was a co-sponsor of the conference, <a href=\"http://www.palestinagrupperna.se/siege-and-mental-health-walls-vs-bridges\">Walls versus Bridges</a> and, with other international organisations, had applied to the Israeli military authorities for permission for each individual to enter. Everyone \u2013 mainly doctors, psychiatrists, academics from the US, Canada and Europe \u2013 was barred, and had to fall back on a blurry video conference from Ramallah.</p> <p>Among the grim testimonies of psychiatrists from Gaza, such as Dr Eyad Saraj from the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, which organised the conference, with WHO, was a video from the former US first lady, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/rc39.html\">Rosalyn Carter</a>. Mrs Carter deplored the fact that \"the closure of Gaza is making it impossible for people to lead normal lives,\" and said she looked forward to the conference's recommendations. </p> <p>Do Miliband and Kouchner really not know what Mrs Carter knows about the devastating impact on people of Israel's continuing control over the Gaza Strip's borders, airspace and coastal water? Or about the effect of Israeli military occupation, checkpoints, and the wall, in crushing economic, social and intellectual life for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank?</p> <p>They should go to Gaza now and see for themselves, as Tony Blair has so shamefully failed to do in his role as Special Envoy for the Quartet. Mr Miliband and Mr Kounchner might then want quietly to tell the Israeli government it will become more and more difficult for them at home to resist the calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions which Palestinian civil society has been asking US and European church and other human rights groups to work for.</p>",
  "<p>Just as the police and nervous households relax after another Halloween of trick or treat, a diehard group of young traditionalists is preparing a second evening of minor mayhem on Britain's streets. </p> <p>Treacled doorknobs and egg throwing will mark the centuries-old tradition of Mischief Night on Tuesday in parts of the north and Midlands, along with more imaginative ways of briefly turning the world upside down. </p> <p>Never commercialised and never involving scrounging for treats in the way which has overwhelmed Halloween, the pranks on November 4 date back to May Eve revels, which were transferred to the towns during the industrial revolution and moved elsewhere in the calendar. </p> <p>\"May Day and the Green Man had little resonance for children in grimy cities,\" says Karen Allen, who is researching the first PhD to examine Mischief Night. \"They looked at the opposite end of the year and found the ideal time, the night before the gunpowder plot.\" </p> <p>Records go back to 1790, when fellows of St John's College, Oxford, studied a headmaster who had encouraged a school play which ended in \"an Ode to Fun which praises children's tricks on Mischief Night in most approving terms\". </p> <p>Allen has also unearthed court judgments in the 1820s which clearly sympathized with an annual chance to let off steam, using phrases such as \"clearly no serious harm was intended\", even about arson attacks. </p> <p>\"There is still a marked strain of nostalgia about the whole tradition,\" says Allan, a student at Bristol University who has also charted the reinvention of Halloween in the United States, which then exported it as trick or treat. </p> <p>\"I interviewed women at Age Concern clubs who unanimously said, 'Oh, it was all very harmless when we did it.' </p> <p>\"Then I went through newspaper archives from the 1950s and found that they were causing absolute mayhem.\" </p> <p>Trick or treat has stolen many of the main Mischief Night gambits, especially swapping houses' gates, smearing glue or treacle on door handles or locks, and creating ambush-webs of string. But the remaining practitioners, who will be out on Tuesday night in all the main Yorkshire cities and Nottingham, can be more imaginative, for example painting corpse outlines familiar from murder scenes on pavements, or hoisting heavy furniture into unlikely places. </p> <p>\"There are not so many Mischief Nighters these days,\" says Allen, who is spending the evening with West Yorkshire police in Leeds and Bradford to add to her research data. \"But it carries on - the tradition has been mistakenly described as on its last legs for well over a century.\" </p> <p>In 1865 a dialect lexicon claimed under the entry \"Mischief neet\" that \"Boys, 30 years ago, used to go about damaging property, believing the law allowed them, on this night. Happily the practice is over.\" Modern sceptics need only look at a series of websites to discover the continuing resilience of 'Mizzy' or 'Miggy' Night diehards. </p> <p>Entries include: \"I actually thought it was legal - coppers can't arrest you on miggy night\" and notes on tying dustbin lids to door handles or putting chewing gum in car locks. \"It's always freezing up north at this time of year,\" confesses one retired practitioner. \"The gum sets like rock.\" </p> <p>Official advice on coping with Mischief Night has also remained constant, from Leeds' chief constable in the 1930s telling citizens: \"Take off your garden gates and hide them\", to modern warnings to ignore small figures skulking in the dusk.</p> <p>The practice also has a tradition of counter-measures which involve things other than paying off children with sweets; Allan's research includes families who \"rigged up hosepipe booby traps to spray mischief makers and formidable old ladies armed with walking sticks keeping watch behind the curtains\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why did David Miliband go to Rwanda when the crisis is in Congo?</strong></p> <p>Rwanda has been heavily embroiled in Congo since more than one million Hutus fled there in 1994, led by extremists responsible for the genocide of around 800,000 Tutsis. The extremists used the cover of the UN-run camps to continue attacks which led Rwanda to invade in 1996, beginning a cycle of conflict that continues today with various armed groups, the Congolese army and Rwandan Hutus competing for territory and control of mining interests. </p> <p>There is particular focus on Rwanda now because it is accused of backing the Tutsi rebel leader, Laurent Nkunda, who is threatening Goma and whose attacks on government forces have forced about 250,000 people from their homes in recent weeks. </p> <p>Nkunda says he is fighting to defend the region's Tutsi population from Hutu extremists but his critics say he is a power hungry warlord who is principally interested in protecting valuable gold, tin and coltan mining interests, like other rebel leaders. </p> <p><strong>Is Rwanda backing Nkunda?</strong></p> <p>Rwanda denies forcefully supporting him, but there is little doubt that it has in the past. Nkunda served in President Paul Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front in the war that ended the 1994 genocide. He then joined the Rwandan-backed rebels who overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko, leader of what was then Zaire, three years later. In the years of conflict and Rwandan occupation that followed, Nkunda worked closely with the powers in Kigali and its army.</p> <p>Even after he took his forces into the Congolese army under a peace agreement, Nkunda maintained his ties with the Rwandan military. Kigali, however, claims to have severed its ties with Nkunda and is clearly embarrassed by his excesses after the Tutsi rebel leader's troops were accused of murdering civilians and mass rape. Nkunda himself has been indicted as a war criminal.</p> <p>The US last week said that while there was no evidence of the Rwandan government directly supporting Nkunda, he has been receiving support from Rwandan soil. That is thought to refer to his continuing close ties to some in the Rwandan army, and that some former Rwandan soldiers are now fighting with Nkunda's forces. </p> <p><strong>Does Britain have influence over Rwanda?</strong></p> <p>Britain's influence in Rwanda has grown considerably as France's has declined since the genocide.</p> <p>Before 1994, the UK did not even have an embassy or a permanent diplomatic presence in Kigali. Now Britain is the single largest contributor of foreign aid to Rwanda, donating $790m (\u00a3488m) over the past five years - nearly half the total international aid to Kigali. The UK is committed to providing Rwanda with at least \u00a346m a year for the next decade.<br> The former international development secretary, Clare Short, led the way with what some critics contended was largely unconditional assistance to an authoritarian government responsible for atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the British government took the view that allowances had to be made for political realities after the genocide and that the Rwandan administration is committed to reconstruction, transparent government and is moving, albeit too slowly, toward greater political freedom. </p> <p>In addition, Tony Blair has developed a personal relationship with Kagame. The former prime minister is scheduled to visit Kigali next week as part of a project to bolster governance that has seen Blair's office place experts in the Rwandan president's office and the cabinet office, and to help establish the country's first think tank. </p> <p>If Miliband is interested in exerting real political pressure on Rwanda, he has a lot more leverage than most foreign ministers.</p>",
  "<p>It's currently the most tantalising guessing game in global affairs: exactly what is the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/world/asia/29kim.html?scp=1&amp;sq=jong-il&amp;st=cse\">state of Kim Jong-il's health</a>?</p> <p>A series of reports variously claim that the North Korean leader is recovering after a stroke or similar ailment, and that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/korea-japan\">French brain surgeon</a> has been consulted. </p> <p>Kim's absence from a series of major set piece events, the latest of which was Thursday's <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-funeral1-2008nov01,0,248533.story\">funeral for Pak Song-chol</a>, one of the founding fathers of the communist regime, has fuelled speculation about a power vacuum in the world's only hereditary communist dictatorship.</p> <p>North Korea's <a href=\"http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm\">state-run media</a> has attempted \u2013 rather ham-fistedly \u2013 to counter this impression by issuing photographs of Kim purportedly attending recent events.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/korea\">Pictures released a fortnight ago</a> supposedly showing the 66-year-old visiting a women's military unit, the first new images of Kim for two months, were called into question when South Korean experts claimed foliage visible in the background indicated the pictures were in fact taken over the summer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7704648.stm\">More photos</a>, released today, are equally frustrating. Kim, wearing his trademark Liza Minelli-esque sunglasses and a brown sports jacket, is pictured inside what looks like an executive spectator box.</p> <p>The captions claim he was watching a football game between two army-affiliated teams. Other photos show the football match with autumnal-looking tress in the background, but no Kim.</p> <p>So does Kim remain on his sickbed? No one outside North Korea really knows. At least, if he did really attend the match, Kim seemed to have enjoyed it. According to state media he took \"great satisfaction over a high level of the game\".</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>D-Day, crunch-time, the final act\u2026</strong> whatever you want to call today's Brazilian grand prix, this is it. After 17 races, a rollercoaster of highs and heartache for the title protagonists and arguably the most gripping championship of the noughties, today a new formula one world champion will be crowned.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Will it be Lewis Hamilton or Felipe Massa? The points standings tell you it should be the former \u2013 the McLaren driver needs only to finish fifth and he will be crowned the youngest-ever title winner, even if Massa wins the race. Sounds easy, doesn't it? But Hamilton had the same points margin \u2013 seven \u2013 over Kimi Raikkonen going into last year's Interlagos finale and we all know what happened then.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>All Massa can do is try to win the race \u2013 and he's made a good stab at it already by taking his sixth pole position of the year at Interlagos yesterday. Should he zoom off into the distance to take the flag and Hamilton finish sixth or lower, then the Caipirinhas will flow and Brazil will applaud its first world champion since Ayrton Senna. Finales don't come more tense than this.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Can we make any worthwhile predictions?</strong><br>Well, if yesterday's qualifying session had been a bit more conventional we could comfortably say that Hamilton would cruise around to third and claim that winner's trophy. But up popped Jarno Trulli at the top end of the timing sheets and now things don't look quite so certain. Massa on pole is in the best place to claim the win he needs, but Hamilton is alongside Ferrari's Raikkonen and has arch rival Fernando Alonso right behind him ...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Here's what the starting grid looks like:</strong></p> <p>1. Felipe Massa (Brazil) Ferrari <br>2. Jarno Trulli (Italy) Toyota <br>3. Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari <br>4. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) McLaren <br>5. Heikki Kovalainen (Finland) McLaren <br>6. Fernando Alonso (Spain) Renault <br>7. Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Toro Rosso-Ferrari <br>8. Nick Heidfeld (Germany) BMW Sauber <br>9. Sebastien Bourdais (France) Toro Rosso-Ferrari <br>10. Timo Glock (Germany) Toyota <br>11. Nelson Piquet (Brazil) Renault <br>12. Mark Webber (Australia) RedBull - Renault <br>13. Robert Kubica (Poland) BMW Sauber <br>14. David Coulthard (Britain) RedBull-Renault<br>15. Rubens Barrichello (Brazil) Honda <br>16. Kazuki Nakajima (Japan) Williams-Toyota <br>17. Jenson Button (Britain) Honda <br>18. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Williams-Toyota <br>19. Giancarlo Fisichella (Italy) Force India-Ferrari <br>20. Adrian Sutil (Germany) Force India-Ferrari</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>The weather:</strong> This could be the big variable today. ITV's commentator Mark Blundell has reported hearing a rumble of thunder and the chances of rain during the grand prix are high. Somehow I don't think we're in for a quiet afternoon \u2026</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>\u2026 unlike Kate Connolly</strong>, my favourite lap-by-lap fan, who emailed this morning to say she wouldn't be able to log on as she's having a GP party. Somewhat controversially for a British lass, she wants Massa to win, but I'll forgive her. Mmm, I could do with a G&amp;T and a bowl of Mini Cheddars right now. I think Kate's got the right idea. How is everyone else celebrating the ultimate grand prix showdown?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Jonny Bull emails to say: </strong>\"I'm glad that ITV have got a nice fitting finale to their run broadcasting F1 - Coultard retiring and Hamilton likely to be crowned world champion. A lesser broadcaster would make this event all about them. Oh wait, did they just show that My Chemical Romance montage again?\" For those who haven't got British TV channels, you've just missed Sebastian Vettel, David Coulthard, Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello doing their best air guitar impressions. Cringing yet?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Ron Dennis's advice to Hamilton on the grid:</strong> \"Avoid trouble on the first lap, settle down into the race and listen to the instructions.\" Oh, and don't lock your brakes into the first corner, tangle with a Renault or run wide trying to pass your team-mate.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>\"Cheer not boo!\"</strong> That's Bernie Ecclestone's little pre-race nugget. Are you surprised to learn that the locals' reaction to the shiny silver car hasn't been entirely supportive?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Euuu-gh!</strong> Most unsettling email of the season goes to Mike Smith. \"Cant get it on TV in Singapore so watching the Guardian site. Very quiet as its 1AM - the only sound is cats having sex outside!\" Mike, that's not the soundtrack to this commentary that I'd been hoping for.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Back on the grid: </strong> \"I'm keeping my fingers crossed for my boy because I'm really proud of him,\" says Anthony Hamilton. Would Lewis be as successful without the implicit support of his dad? Maybe not.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Lewis Hamilton - Nicolas Clarke needs you. </strong>\"I have been left on my own because my wife is in Nepal on a charity trek and mistakenly listened to the Leonard Cohen Hallelujah documentary on the BBC iplayer. A Hamilton win is very much in need to cheer me up! And I'm an Arsenal fan.\" Nicolas, you have many woes. You're not a rugby league fan too, are you?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Counting down to the start... </strong> who's feeling tense? Who can guess at Trulli, Raikkonen and Alonso's allegiances? How much of a part are they going to play in deciding this world championship?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>IT'S SPITTING!</strong> Would you believe, it's just started to drizzle. Out come the pack-a-macs ... and the start has been aborted as the teams aren't ready for the rain. It's coming down pretty heavy now. This is definitely cause for intermediates.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>It looks like chaos</strong> on the grid ... but far less than it would have been if the rain had held off for a few minutes and started while they were on the first lap. It looks like it's stopped raining already, just minutes after it started. Heaven knows what tyres they are going to gamble on.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>No more rain </strong>is expected for at least 30 or 40 minutes, but the track is wet after that sudden shower. So ... slicks or inters? That depends on whether you're trying to play it safe and win a championship. It's about eight minutes until the start of the race so they have a little time to see if the track will dry out some.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Philip Howells</strong> emails to say: \"Hope you've been going through your copies of 'Colemanballs' for those classic phrases ...\" Philip, I'm a bit too young to be a Private Eye reader, but being a good Northerner I am partial to Uncle Joe's Mint Balls if that's close enough for you?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Arnoux</strong> emails to ask: \"is the Brazilian rain a sign that the gods are smiling on the local boy? Anyone remember Senna winning at Interlagos in 1991 and 1993 when the rain effectively saved him!?\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>The formation lap starts, </strong>the intermediate tyres are fitted but we know they're going to have to change for slicks soon as it's no longer raining. Get ready for the start...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Go! Go! Go! Go!</strong> A cautious start, with Hamilton playing it safe in fourth place. Massa leads. Accident at the back.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>It's Massa, Trulli, Raikkonen and Hamilton</strong> at the front but the safety car has been deployed for the accident, which involves David Coulthard - in his final ever grand prix! - and Nelson Piquet Jr. What a desperately sad end for the Scot.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Kubica</strong> had gambled on slicks but pitted on the formation lap and made the start from the pit lane.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Lap one: </strong>So the order at the front remains the same. Behind Hamilton, who is fourth, are Vettel, Alonso and Kovalainen.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Lap two: </strong>Fisichella pits from the back.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Lap three:</strong> Replays show that Coulthard was tipped into a spin by the Williams of Rosberg, then hit by the other Williams of Nakajima.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Racing again</strong> and Kovalainen is trying to get past Alonso but hasn't managed it.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Lap five: </strong>Massa leads by just under a second, ahead of Trulli, Raikkonen and Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Lap six:</strong> Heidfeld takes 11th from Barrichello. Hamilton seems to have dropped back from the front three and is poised to come under pressure from Vettel.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Lap seven:</strong> Raikkonen is hustling Trulli. Rosberg and Button are in the pits.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Lap eight: </strong>Massa's lead is 2.1 seconds. Raikkonen hasn't got past Trulli yet. Heidfeld has taken eighth from Webber.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lap 10:</strong> Vettel and Alonso pit and change to dry tyres. As several others further down the grid have already done.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Lap 11:</strong> Massa and Kovalainen both pit. The Finn's stop is very tardy. Honda are having a foam party in the pit lane. No, sorry, an extinguisher has just gone off.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Trulli, Hamilton and Raikkonen</strong> have all pitted. Raikkonen gets out ahead of Trulli. And Hamilton very, very nearly exited ahead of Trulli. But Alonso is on track ahead of them. The Renault driver's early stop has paid off. Have McLaren left it too long to change his tyres?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Lap 12:</strong> Hamilton has passed Trulli. Massa seems to be struggling with his dry tyres. The order is Massa, Vettel, Alonso, Raikkonen, Fisichella and Hamilton. The early stop for Fisichella was a stroke of genius.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Lap 13:</strong> Fisichella is all over the back of Raikkonen ... is the Ferrari driver trying to hold up the rest of the field and let Massa streak away?</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lap 14:</strong> Massa has set the fastest lap. Hamilton needs to get past Fisichella - if the race were to finish like this Massa would be world champion, as they'd be tied on points but with more wins for Massa.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Lap 15: </strong>Vettel is under one second behind Massa. Hamilton is 10 seconds off the head of the field.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Lap 16: </strong>Hamilton is starting to look impatient behind Fisichella and so he should be ... the longer he stays there the worse his situation will get.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Lap 18:</strong> Hamilton <em>just</em> gets past Fisichella at the first corner but it was oh-so-close to going horribly wrong. Now he's in fifth position - exactly where he needs to be.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Lap 19:</strong> Vettel still less than a second behind Massa. The young German is told over the radio that no more rain is forecast.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Lap 20: </strong>Hamilton's pace is a second off Massa's and he's obviously being cautious. Glock has made it past Fisichella and into sixth. Bourdais runs very wide trying to pass Trulli and drops several places.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Lap 21: </strong>Vettel has just set the fasest lap. He's keeping Massa in check - but do we really think he's going to pass the Brazilian? The German does have a Ferrari engine in the back of his car ...</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Lap 22:</strong> The order stays the same - Massa, Vettel, Alonso, Raikkonen, Hamilton, Glock, Fisichella and Trulli are in the points positions.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Lap 23: </strong> Glock is a second and a half shy of Hamilton. Looks like he might be a threat to the McLaren.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Lap 24: </strong> Massa set the fastest lap on that one. Hamilton is still all but a second slower.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Lap 25: </strong> Now Vettel sets the fastest time again. This pair are going hammer and tongs at the front. Kovalainen is in ninth - not a good position for McLaren's constructors' championship hopes.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Lap 26:</strong> Fastest lap to Massa. It's just going to swing between the two at the front, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Lap 27:</strong> Vettel pits from second place and Kovalainen has now passed Trulli for eighth place.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Lap 28:</strong> Massa is 4.2 seconds ahead of Alonso. Raikkonen is a further 10 seconds behind. Vettel rejoins in sixth position. That leaves Hamilton in fourth.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Lap 29: </strong>Hamilton is 4.3 seconds off Raikkonen. A replay shows him locking up.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Lap 31:</strong> Hamilton sets the fastest lap.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Lap 32: </strong>Glock sets the fastest lap, but TV reports say he took on no fuel in his first stop to change tyres.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Lap 33:</strong> The order is Massa, Alonso, Raikkonen, Hamilton, Glock, Vettel, Kovalainen, Fisichella, Trulli, Heidfeld, Webber, Barrichello, Bourdais, Rosberg, Button, Sutil, Kubica, Nakajima. Only two retirements, Piquet and career retiree Coulthard ... bet he's cracked open the Buckfast back in the motorhome.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Lap 34: </strong>Massa breaks the 1min 13sec barrier with a new fastest lap.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Lap 36:</strong> Massa's fastest laps come thick and fast. Glock pits.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Lap 37:</strong> Glock took a very long stop due to a sticky hose and is likely to be fuelled to the end. He rejoins in 14th position ... which will make the McLaren team smile. He may no longer be a threat to Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Lap 38: </strong>Massa pits with a seven second lead over Alonso. He rejoins in fourth place. Doesn't seem to be fuelled to the end.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Lap 39: </strong>Alonso, yet to stop, leads from Raikkonen and Hamilton. McLaren's mechanics march into the pit lane.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Lap 40: </strong>Hamilton and Alonso both pit.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>Lap 41:</strong> Hamilton rejoins in sixth place. The order at the front is now Raikkonen (one stop), Massa, Vettel, Alonso (all two stops), Kovalainen (one stop), Hamilton (two stops), Trulli and Heidfeld (both one stop).</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Lap 43: </strong>Kovalainen pits and Hamilton moves up into fifth.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Lap 44: </strong>Raikkonen stops and rejoins in fourth position ... ahead of Hamilton. It's great news for Ferrari's constructors' title aspirations.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>Lap 45:</strong> Button has passed Barichello for 11th place. Could this be Barrichello's final race? Not if he can help it ... but he is getting on a bit now! Sutil pits down at the back of the field.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>Lap 46:</strong> It's Massa from Vettel, Alonso, Raikkonen and Hamilton. If it stays like this, the title will be Hamilton's.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>No more rain</strong> has materialised so it looks like a straight-forward run to the flag now in the last 24 laps. Is that good or not? Probably is for my fingernails. And the blood pressure of sports editors across Britain after defeat in the cricket and rugby league.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Lap 49:</strong> Webber, who was in sixth, has pitted for his second stop. Video replays show Hamilton working his way through the traffic with few problems.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>ITV's commentator James Allen</strong> is struggling to say dynamometer ... dynomomometer... dynomermonmator. Just think how difficult it will be to pronounce once he's had a few jars at the broadcaster's farewell formula one party tonight.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>Lap 52:</strong> Vettel has pitted and rejoined in fifth position. So Hamilton is now fourth. Good.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>Did anyone read</strong> this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/29/formula-one-motor-sport-mansell-1986\">From The Vault</a>? Not trying to jinx Hamilton or anything, just asking.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>Lap 53:</strong> Vettel is just 2.2 seconds shy of Hamilton. If he closes, will Hamilton let him sail by to avoid any disasters?</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>Lap 54:</strong> Vettel is 1.7 seconds behind Hamilton now ... these are the two cars to watch.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>Marcus Gearey</strong> has emailed in, Carry On-style, to read a little innuendo into the ITV commentary: \"Was James Allen's risque nozzle comment 20 minutes ago his Russell Brand pre-emptive resignation statement, in an \"I know the BBC aren't going to hire me so I can say something about a nozzle not going into a slot being one of the more pressing problems without fear of retribution\" sort of way?</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>Oh gawd,</strong> Alonso is being told over the radio that rain is coming ... and there's only 15 laps left.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>Lap 57:</strong> It's Massa from Alonso, Raikkonen, Hamilton and Vettel. Hamilton has responded to Vettel's pace to stay ahead. \"Could rain in 10 minutes,\" says Kubica's engineer over the radio. The Pole is down in 15th, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>Lap 59:</strong> TV cameras show the crowds waving their macs about ... is it starting to drizzle? There are dark clouds. If it rains this championship could go either way. If not, Hamilton looks set to take it.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>Lap 60:</strong> Raikkonen is just 2.3 seconds behind Alonso. Blimey, if he gets past, that'll leave Alonso ahead of Hamilton ... will he slow down and cause the McLaren some drama? Well, he has said he'll do all he can to help Massa win the title.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>Lap 61:</strong> Ten laps to go and no more rain drops have fallen yet.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>Lap 62:</strong> Raikkonen is just 1.2 seconds from Alonso now.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>\"As soon as you feel rain</strong> on your visor, let us know and we'll bring you in to change tyres,\" says Nico Rosberg's engineer over the radio. Here it comes ...</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>Lewis's brother Nic </strong>stands in the pit lane to see if there's any rain yet. A few spots are falling on the main straight according to Alonso's engineer.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>Lap 63:</strong> Vettel is just 0.6 seconds behind Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>Lap 65:</strong> Hedifeld pits to take on intermediates ... but it seems more of a gamble than a necessity. Pictures show it's raining heavily.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> defending from Vettel ... but the McLaren is holding his ground. Rain is falling harder.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>Lap 66:</strong> The Ferrari and McLaren crews are out in the pitlane. Raikkonen has changed tyres. Alonso pits to change tyres. Hamilton pits too, as does Vettel.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> needs hard rain to make this tyre stop neccesary</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>Lap 67: </strong>Massa pits as well to take on inters.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> needs to keep Vettel behind to claim this title.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>Lap 68:</strong> The rain has not really come hard enough. Massa leads and Hamilton is fifth, but he must keep Vettel behind. Three laps to go.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>Disaster!</strong> Vettel passes Hamilton, leaving the British driver in sixth place and staring down the barrel for the second year in a row.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>Lap 69:</strong> Hamilton must get back past Vettel if he wants to win the title. He's only in sixth position. Glock is on dry tyres in fourth place. If he clings on it's over for Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p>Hamilton and Massa will be on the same points if it finishes like this, but Massa will take the title because he has more wins under his belt.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>It looks like it's all over for Hamilton.</strong> This is incredible - can he get past Vettel in the last few corners? He's not close enough yet.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>Massa takes the chequered flag</strong> to win the grand prix, but what's happeneing behind him?</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>Amazing stuff! </strong> On the third-last corner of the final lap of the final race of the season, Lewis Hamilton passes Glock to go into the fith place he needs to win the championship. Can he hold on?</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>Yes he can!</strong> Hamilton finishes fifth in the Brazilian grand prix to become the youngest ever winner of the formula one championship.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>Funny stuff!</strong> The pit camera pans to the Ferrari team, who are celebrarting wildly because they think Massa has won the title. Their jubilation is curtailed abruptly when it becomes apparent that he has not. The look on their collective face at the exact moment the penny drops is priceless. Hamilton has finished fifth, he's the champion. Absolutely unbelievable.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>Anthony Hamilton:</strong> \"I really cannot find any words. Great, absolutely great ... it's a shame the crowd are doing this [booing].\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>Massa appears to wipe away tears</strong> as he climbs out of his car. The crowd cheer and he bows. The disappointment is tangible. A Honda is on fire in <em>parc ferme</em>.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p>The new world champion is having some problems putting his steering wheel back on and it's delaying his celebrations.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>First stop for Hamilton:</strong> hugging his team members. Then a hug for his family. He won't be celebrating with a podium position, but it doesn't really matter because he's going out with a Pussycat Doll.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>What more can I say?</strong> Unless you're Brazilian, you cannot fail to be thrilled by that race. The best formula one championship of the decade without a doubt. Thanks for following the coverage. I can't wait for next season, can you?</p>",
  "<p>An Islamist rebel administration in Somalia had a 13-year-old girl stoned to death for adultery after the child's father reported that three men had raped her.</p> <p>Amnesty International said the al-Shabab militia, which controls the southern port city of Kismayo, arranged for a group of 50 men to stone Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow in front of a crowd of about 1,000 spectators. A lorryload of stones was brought to the stadium for the killing.</p> <p>Amnesty said that Duhulow struggled with her captors and had to be forcibly carried into the stadium.</p> <p>\"At one point during the stoning, Amnesty International has been told by numerous eyewitnesses that nurses were instructed to check whether Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was still alive when buried in the ground. They removed her from the ground, declared that she was, and she was replaced in the hole where she had been buried for the stoning to continue,\" the human rights group said. </p> <p>\"Inside the stadium, militia members opened fire when some of the witnesses to the killing attempted to save her life, and shot dead a boy who was a bystander.\"</p> <p>Amnesty said witnesses originally reported that Duhulow was 23-years-old, based on her appearance. But the human rights group found out from her father that she was a child.</p> <p>Duhulow's father told Amnesty that when they tried to report her rape to the militia, the child was accused of adultery and detained. None of the men Duhulow accused was arrested.</p> <p>\"This was not justice, nor was it an execution,\" said Amnesty's Somalia campaigner, David Copeman. \"This child suffered an horrendous death at the behest of the armed opposition groups who currently control Kismayo. </p> <p>\"This killing is yet another human rights abuse committed by the combatants to the conflict in Somalia, and again demonstrates the importance of international action to investigate and document such abuses, through an international commission of inquiry.\"<br> Amnesty said al-Shabab had created a climate of fear in which government officials, journalists and human rights activists faced death threats and killing if they spoke against the militia.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese news media is tightly controlled. To make things worse, decisions by the censors are often arbitrary. Propaganda officials seldom explain to editors and publishers why one story must be deleted and why some reports are forbidden. There's no clear rule in this area, and all decisions are based on the officials' personal judgment. Chinese courts normally won't accept cases relating to the decisions by the propaganda officials, even if these decisions might destroy a publication and leave hundreds of people jobless. It is an open secret that media censorship is still one of the very few areas that are free from legal supervision.</p> <p>So it was brave of Cui Fang, a reporter working for China Business Post, to file a lawsuit on Wednesday against the Bureau of Press and Publications in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, accusing the Bureau of violating laws when it ordered a three-month suspension of the paper.</p> <p>In July, China Business Post published a story based on Cui Fang's investigation, reporting that a subsidiary of the Agricultural Bank of China in Hunan province breached regulations in writing off 4.61bn yuan (\u00a3387m) bad debt, an allegation the bank strongly denied. Two months later, China Business Post was suspended from publication for three months by a \"superior administration\" \u2013 believed to be the Bureau of Press and Publications.</p> <p>In her <a href=\"http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4bdb1fa00100b2gn.html\">complaint</a>, Cui demands the administration lift the suspension of China Business Post, issue a public apology and pay her a symbolic one yuan (9p) compensation. According to Zhou Ze, the lawyer representing Cui, a court in Hohhot (the capital of Inner Mongolia) is now assessing the lawsuit and will decide whether to accept it later.</p> <p>This case has attracted wide attention as it is the first time a journalist has challenged the censors through the courts. Most journalists and editors I talked to support Cui's decision, but doubt the case will be upheld by the court.</p> <p>But Cui's attempt to challenge the censors through the courts is the first time this legal loophole has been brought to the attention of the public. Hopefully a debate will follow. Nobody in China expects censorship to disappear because of this challenge, but if the censors are forced to hand out clear rules then some progress will have been made. Undoubtedly, this process will take a long time, since control of the media is something the Communist party won't give up easily.</p> <p>In the meantime, even if the court accepts her case, Cui faces the task of proving her reporting is correct. Some have speculated that the court will order her to give the names of her sources, several local bank officials. In <a href=\"http://www.tianya.cn/techforum/content/142/541502.shtml\">her blog</a>, Cui says it would be difficult to persuade those people to testify before the court. They would lose their jobs if they did. Cui is facing the double burden of challenging the censors as well as protecting her sources. She may be fighting a losing battle, but whatever the outcome, she deserves all our support.</p>",
  "<p>David McVicar's La Traviata looks set to become another Scottish Opera repertoire production. His latest offering may not present the opera in a radical new light, but it brings the director's trademark sumptuous period style to the work while keeping superfluous gimmicky details to a minimum.</p> <p>Tanya McCallin's designs bring all the expected period flourishes - plenty of chandeliers and heaving bosoms, and the gloomy tone here is set by the omnipresent black draperies. There is some suggestion that the action is playing out in Alfredo's memory: the overture sees him traversing a leaf-strewn front of stage, Violetta's closed-up apartment visible in the background, while the ensuing three acts play out across her tombstone. It's a suggestion; the idea isn't developed any further. McVicar is at his best in the set pieces: though the first act felt a little constrained on opening night, the party scene of act two is an opportunity for some Moulin Rouge-style high jinks. After such flamboyance, the simplicity of the final act, lit in cool, grey tones by Jennifer Tipton, is all the more striking.</p> <p>Carmen Giannattasio brings a voice of dark-hued power and fluidity to Violetta. Though initially not the most appealing of characterisations, it develops to a magnificent, pathos-filled final scene. Unfortunately, her performance is not equalled by that of Federico Lepre, who sounds out of his depth as Alfredo. He has neither the charisma nor the vocal power to express the ardour that persuades Violetta to abandon her life of hedonism. Compensation is provided elsewhere: Richard Zeller is an imposing presence as Germont senior while Catriona Barr gives a quietly impressive performance as Violetta's maid in the final act.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you, Sir Allen, thank you. (And no, I'm not on the Stanford payroll.) The week in Antigua may well have done the game of cricket a fine service.</p> <p>We now know how ghastly the brave new world might be. But thanks to the Stanford experience there is still scope to swerve. Some timely reminders have been issued and maybe the entrepreneurs who now control the modern game will take notice. For example, we have been reminded that the size of the purse cannot dictate whether a sporting contest is worthwhile; accruing stacks of cash for the game and its cricketers is important, but not the most important priority as we seek to shape the future.</p> <p>My reservations about the shenanigans in Antigua have nothing to do with Sir Allen Stanford bouncing Wags on his knee (albeit, it transpires, not knowing who they were). Nor does it worry me that he strolled into the England dressing room uninvited.</p> <p>It seems that the England players have been unduly precious. There is the pretence that they are in Antigua only because they were told to go. I'm sure the ECB would have been tolerant of any conscientious objectors.</p> <p>I have to blink when I hear them say that they are aching to leave Antigua and head off to India. I would have rushed off to the Caribbean like a gazelle if offered a similar deal 20-odd years ago. The possibility of acquiring such riches without having to offer tacit support to an evil apartheid regime would have been irresistible. If sufficiently courageous Mr Stanford would have been welcome to bounce my wife on his knee and to pay a visit to the haven of my locker in the dressing room. Graeme Swann was right: 'He wanders around as if he owns the ground. Hang on, he does own the ground.'</p> <p>We should not be concentrating on Stanford's idiosyncrasies, but on the short-form fever that threatens to take over the world.</p> <p>Although the Twenty20 format has been tarnished, there is a place for it. The world championship worked well in South Africa. One hopes that the same tournament will be a success in England next summer. Crucially, it seems to matter who wins it.</p> <p>After its initial year, the Indian Premier League shows every sign of working. That window for the world's leading players will have to be found whether the ECB or the ICC like it or not. The problem for both at the moment is that they can't get their hands on any of the money.</p> <p>The trap is to seek to emulate the IPL all around the globe. For 2010 in the UK, the plan is to have two Twenty20 tournaments, one that runs throughout the season, and a short, sharp affair in July with possibly as many as four overseas players per county and a mandatory Indian cricketer in each team. (Why? To boost TV ratings in the subcontinent, thereby multiplying potential income. Don't you know anything about the modern game?)</p> <p>There is still time for a coherent schedule for 2010 to be drafted, maybe incorporating just one Twenty20 competition, a format that the poor old punter can understand. The ECB are desperate for an EPL to rival the IPL asap. On a more personal level, the great entrepreneurs in charge in India and England, Lalit Modi and Giles Clarke, do not wish to be outdone by one another. There may even be time to establish that IPL window as the two sides swallow a bit of pride and come up with a compromise.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the ECB are conducting a review of the Stanford series, which is their euphemism for, 'Don't fret, we're urgently looking into the latest cock-up'. Like the BBC, they comb the papers pretty carefully these days.</p> <p>It has been an extraordinary few days, but one source of amazement is that anybody should be surprised by the tenor of the Stanford festival. Those who saw the launch of the Stanford series at Lord's in June with that treasure chest of cash on view, flanked by Viv Richards and Ian Botham on one side, Clarke and the ECB chief executive, David Collier, on the other, have no reason to be surprised that Allen Stanford should want Antigua to be a celebration of his dream rather than of the game.</p> <p>There have been bits to admire. The experiment of umpires consulting over tricky decisions has been relatively successful and should be pursued. Andrew Strauss's dropped catch was pretty entertaining. And I have not been as perplexed as many by the state of the pitch and the outfield. I quite like it when a boundary is an event rather than a formality. But I have not enjoyed the sight of great old West Indies cricketers, now 'Legends', in their Stanford T-shirts, desperately trying to look interested, or the uncritical delight of the TV commentators. And I haven't cared a jot who wins.</p> <p>What have we learnt? That Twenty20 should not take over the world. Stanford admits to being bored by Test cricket, but not everybody is. It is imperative that the cricketing potentates produce a balanced schedule that recognises the value of the longer game. What else have we learnt? Something we already knew: that just the smell of money makes mankind behave in most peculiar ways.</p>",
  "<p>Spurs. To paraphrase Edwin Starr, what are they good for? A laugh has been the short answer for most of the season, though in their new incarnation with Harry Hotspur at the helm they have already improved on absolutely nothing. On Wednesday night they scored the goal of the season, produced one of the comebacks of the season and succeeded in annoying the hell out of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and those are the sort of memories that do not quickly fade. And that was before they accounted for Liverpool's unbeaten record.</p> <p>Spurs used to be about much more than that. They were the original glory, glory club, the first modern Double winners and home to icons of the calibre of Blanchflower, Mackay, Hoddle, Waddle, Gascoigne and others. And all in living memory, too. Yet in the same way that equally proud Everton were undone forever by a seismic shift in the balance of power on Merseyside, Spurs have watched aghast over the past couple of decades as their hated rivals have stolen their shtick. It wasn't too bad when Arsenal were merely functional and boring under George Graham, even if two titles in three seasons did underline the lack of league success at White Hart Lane since 1961, but when Wenger's Gunners began to win rave reviews for style and audacity, as well as hauling in domestic silverware and excelling in the Champions League, it became difficult to see how Spurs could possibly counter. People who insist Arsenal are lucky and believe Spurs have the monopoly on style can still be found, though they are a dying breed. Exciting as Wednesday's eight-goal thriller was, Graham remains the only one of eight Spurs managers to have beaten Wenger's Arsenal in the league.</p> <p>Initially, Spurs took their lead from Arsenal and Chelsea (Liverpool would shortly follow) and went down the foreign-coach route. They wavered sufficiently after the Christian Gross shock to return to the traditional virtues of Graham, Glenn Hoddle and then David Pleat, before turning back to Jacques Santini and Martin Jol with a new determination to make the continental sporting-director system work. Full marks for trying, but that well intentioned policy came to a crashing close with the appointment of Harry Redknapp.</p> <p>'The Premier League is an unforgiving competition,' Daniel Levy, the chairman of the bottom-placed club wrote, a tad unnecessarily, in his open letter to Spurs supporters last weekend. 'In appointing our new manager we have secured the services of someone whose knowledge of all levels of football, including importantly the Premier League, is outstanding. The purchasing of players is a critical aspect of our club, and we were not as decisive in our dealings this summer as we should have been. We have spent around \u00a3175m on new players over the last three years, and given our present position it is essential we go into the January transfer window with absolute confidence in the advice being offered to the board.'</p> <p>So there you have it. The transfer window claims yet another managerial victim, or a bunch of victims if you include Juande Ramos's assistants and directors. A common thread running through almost every sacking over the past two or three years has been the way the restrictions on transfer activity have concentrated boardroom worries into two basic questions. Are we happy with the players the manager bought last time, and are we willing to trust him with our money again? The extent to which Tottenham are admitting to getting it wrong last time can be judged by their headlong rush to place 'absolute confidence' in someone whose transfer dealings have been queried in the past, though this is no time to reopen a witch-hunt. What Spurs are acknowledging is that Redknapp knows the market, makes the moves, buys decent players and gets good performances out of them, whereas, by inference, the last lot didn't.</p> <p>Just as it is too simplistic to suggest Spurs have sent the sporting director system scurrying back to the continent where it belongs - many of our clubs already know how to delegate - it may be premature to hail them as the saviours of the English manager. Redknapp, at 61, is unlikely to be the new Bill Nicholson - he may not even be around to see the club rehoused in its new 60,000-seat stadium. And much of what players say in praise of his managerial skills - great motivator, confidence man, makes you feel 10ft tall - echoes what everyone said about Kevin Keegan last season. No one would wish to put a dampener on a Spurs revival or question the morale-building job Redknapp already seems to have performed on David Bentley and Luka Modric, but what English managers have found in the past is that motivation can only take a team so far. That's why leading teams looked abroad in the first place.</p> <p>From where Spurs are at the moment, however, if Redknapp can take them as far as the top half of the table it will be far enough, and if he can carry on as entertainingly as he has started then life at the Lane will never be dull. That could be Tottenham's new motto, to go with last week's announcements of new manager, new ground, and new direction. Audere est Facere is so dated, don't you think? How about something that trades on the new unique selling point? Nessun Dorma perhaps, or, if you must have Latin, Nolite Ante Tempus Discedere*.</p> <p>* Don't leave early</p> <h2>Hey, kissers. Leave the badge alone</h2> <p>Apart from the mentality of the people who turned up at Portsmouth Guildhall just to boo Harry Redknapp, is there anything in the world of sport as childishly silly and offensively unnecessary as badge kissing in football?</p> <p>At Everton last week, had Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal by removing his shirt, he would have been booked. A similar fate would have befallen him had he gone to the Manchester United fans and indulged in a few hugs and high fives. Yet those are harmless jollities compared to taunting opponents by reminding them of changed allegiances - in the circumstances a deliberately provocative act at Goodison - and all referee Alan Wiley could do was have a quiet word.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the same day, the rancorous atmosphere that eventually led to crowd trouble in the Wear-Tyne derby was hardly helped by Joey Barton ostentatiously kissing his badge in front of Sunderland supporters. Barton has been at Newcastle five minutes and has no emotional attachment to the club beyond his pay packet, and even that is a tie his employers considered severing in summer.</p> <p>Doubtless Rooney and Barton would argue they were responding to abuse, and it may be that supporters are the ones who need to grow up most, though some sort of consistency should be applied before we end up on a downward spiral into the bear-pit. People will be spitting on opponents' logos or planting flags in their centre circles next. Kissing your badge in front of opposing supporters is a more provocative act than celebrating with your own, and should be recognised as such. Unless you are Gary Neville, putting up with more than anyone should have to while playing for Manchester United at Anfield and boldly standing up for yourself. Kissing your badge in front of your own supporters is even worse, and should attract an automatic caution for insulting behaviour. It insults everyone's intelligence.</p> <h2>Victorian values would help everyone's health and safety</h2> <p>Once upon a time there was a club called Horwich RMI (Railway Mechanics Institute) that managed to last for 99 years before moving from Bolton to Leigh and becoming Leigh RMI in the process. That 1995 name-change led to a drop in support from the Horwich area (the immediate environs of the Reebok Stadium, basically), so this year the club was rebranded Leigh Gemini in a bid to draw a line under the past, and rehoused along with the Centurions rugby league team in Leigh Sports Village, a state-of-the-art new facility won for the town by local MP Andy Burnham, keen Evertonian and secretary for Culture, Media and Sport.</p> <p>The only snag is that the Sports Village cannot open until December at the earliest. That is not such a problem for the rugby team, whose season starts in February, but, with Hilton Park condemned, Gemini have been left homeless, fulfilling their fixtures at Chorley but struggling for support and revenue. Their chairman, Dominic Speakman, has just quit, having failed to see a return on any of his investment or any hint of assistance from the local council. 'The final straw was when the health and safety advisory committee gave its verdict on stewarding requirements,' Speakman explained.

  "<h2>'I think about the families, and a life torn apart'</h2> <p>The locals line up pints of bitter at the Kings Head bar in Droylsden, Greater Manchester. Behind the till Ronnie Downes, 60, reads his son's last letter home. Outside the pub hangs a huge picture of Tony and the words: 'Tony: Our son, Everyone's Hero'.</p> <p>Guardsman Neil 'Tony' Downes, aged 20, was travelling with the Afghan National Army close to the town of Sangin in Helmand province when their vehicle was hit by an explosion. </p> <p>Before going out to Afghanistan, Tony wrote his family a letter to be opened in the event of his death. Standing in their pub, Ronnie recites passages: 'I love you all from the bottom of my heart. Please don't be mad at what has happened. I did what I had to do, and serving the British army was it. Don't be sad - celebrate my life, because I love you and I will see you all again.' As he finishes, Ronnie falters and breaks down in tears.</p> <p>'What amazed me most was that my mum and dad were really strong. That really brought us together as a family,' says Ronnie's eldest daughter, Katie, 21. 'My mum campaigned for the soldiers, for the job they were and are doing out there in Afghanistan and Iraq, and inspired us all. Everyone expected her to be the other way. She urged the government not to bring troops home - because it would mean Tony died in vain. </p> <p>'Tony loved serving with the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. He died doing something he loved. It doesn't stop our pain, but it comforts us to know how fulfilled he was in his career and life as a soldier. My brother had only been in Afghanistan for 12 weeks and was due to return home on 28 June 2007. That date became the date of his funeral.'</p> <p>Katie says the hardest thing was listening to her brother's letter: 'I think about what must have gone through his head when he was writing that, knowing that he could die.</p> <p>'Before he left for good, and I remember this vividly, he was packing up one of his huge rucksacks and out popped two letters, from the top of his bag. They both said: \"Not to be opened unless deceased.\" I remember catching my breath as I saw the writing on the envelope.</p> <p>'My brother was the 60th member of the armed forces to die in Afghanistan since the start of operations in November, 2001, and for the first time it really made me think about what all those other families have gone through and all the families since - each death of a child, a brother, a husband, a boyfriend or a father, a life torn apart.' </p> <p>The soldier's younger sister, Jodie, 17, describes how she now visits her brother's grave more than ever. 'I talk to him in the cemetery. Sometimes I stand, other times I kneel down and talk to him like he is there,' she says. 'Some days I cry; other days I just pass the time of day. I feel silly and self-conscious speaking to a grave, but whenever I look around, nobody is paying the slightest bit of attention. There are other people there at the gravesides, crying and mourning in their own way, talking to their loved ones and praying. It is definitely therapeutic.' </p> <p>She adds: 'What has helped me above everything is knowing he is in a better place, a happy place, in heaven. It may sound daft, but I believe angels are looking after him up there, and he is looking down on me and probably laughing at me crying. If he could speak he would probably just laugh and tell me not to be so daft. </p> <p>'Losing my big brother has definitely brought me closer to all my siblings and to mum and dad. In some ways it makes you special having a brother as a war hero; people look at you and feel sorry for you, but also admire what you have gone through. </p> <p>'I am only young, but what I do know is I never want to feel pain like this again. I have cried enough now.'</p> <h2>'I couldn't bear to see his coffin in the flag'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339238064\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/01/Ruth-Rayment-220x300.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Rayment\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Rayment lost her brother Christopher when she was 16.

Inside her family home, Ruth Rayment, left, sits in front of an electric fire, her knees scrunched up around her neck. She is surrounded by army memorabilia that belonged to her brother, Christopher.</p> <p>'I was 16 when he died,' says the nursing student, now 20. 'When the men in uniform came knocking on my door, we knew what it was straight away. I remember my mother screaming and collapsing in the front room, I will never forget the wailing.'</p> <p>Christopher Rayment, a private with the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, died aged 22 when a security barrier fell on him while he was manning a checkpoint. He had been in Iraq for more than five months and died just 10 days before he was due to return home to his parents, Pamela and Gordon. Four years on his room remains virtually untouched.</p> <p>'Everyone expected it to hit me hardest, but I didn't mourn for a year,' says Ruth. 'I started crying on the anniversary of Chris's death - that's when the trauma hit me. It came like a black cloud; it consumed me, and I realised I was depressed. I kept hearing my brother's voice. His presence wasn't frightening, just permanent.'</p> <p>Ruth thinks her decision not to go to Brize Norton to watch her brother's body arrive back in the UK contributed to what she calls 'suspended reality'.</p> <p>'For me he was still out there, in Afghanistan, patrolling as a soldier,' she says. 'That's what I convinced myself of, anyway, that he wasn't coming back because he was still out there.</p> <p>'I think this feeling was because I couldn't bear to see him come back, to see his coffin in the flag. When the realisation he was gone finally hit me, a year later, it felt like I'd been hit by a huge black wave, like a tsunami, and the water was pouring into my ears and nose, suffocating me. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.'</p> <p>Ruth's sister, Mandy, 29, says her experience of Chris's death was different. She went to Brize Norton to see his body arrive. 'I can honestly say it was the proudest, and in a strange way the happiest, moment of my life,' she says. 'I sent Chris a little charm to take to Afghanistan, a little St Christopher, and it was returned with his body. I keep it with me at all times now.' </p> <p>Both sisters share a strong sense of spirituality and, like many relatives of the 'Fallen', Mandy has started seeing a clairvoyant. The medium, she claims, brings her closer to her brother's spirit. That is why she finds it hard to visit his grave; she thinks his soul is elsewhere: 'Since Chris died I've been going to church, and last week I was finally baptised. People might think I could be angry with God for what has happened to my family, but my belief in God helps me to come to terms with what has happened. It is his plan and my brother, in the middle of all of this, is in a happier place and is smiling down on us.'</p> <h2>'Daddy is happy in heaven eating crispy duck'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339238065\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/11/01/Courtney-Ellis-460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Courtney Ellis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seven-year-old Courtney Ellis at home in Manchester.

'The weather is the hardest thing about living in England,' says Camari. 'He brought us here from the islands - my man - to give us a future, and now he has left us. We are alone.

Her husband was killed on 2 May 2008 in the Nowzad area of northern Helmand, the victim of a Taliban landmine.</p> <p>Ratu's journey began in an MoD recruiting interview in Suva, Fiji's port capital. He was one of a growing foreign legion fighting for someone else's queen and country. He arrived in the UK in May 2004, and his first deployment overseas came four years later. But within a month of arriving in Afghanistan, the 29-year-old Fijian was dead. On the other side of the world, uniformed officers and a Household Cavalry chaplain were dispatched to Windsor to knock on Camari's door.</p> <p>'Other wives and mothers tell me they knew when they opened the door and saw the uniformed officers standing on the doorstep,' she says. 'I didn't know. I didn't expect it, because I probably didn't understand how dangerous my husband's job was. I thought they had come to see me about my son's British citizenship. I couldn't stop crying.</p> <p>'He returned six days later in a coffin with a foreign flag over his body,' says Camari. 'All I could think about was that my boys would never know their father; they would never play rugby with him, or be scolded for not doing their homework. To them, their father would be a photograph - not even a memory. </p> <p>'The band played at Brize Norton and I stood there weeping, clutching my children's hands.

  "<p><strong>Winning question:</strong> I recently went to see a well-known dermatologist regarding Thermage and Fraxel. I would like to ask your opinion on Thermage in particular, about the long term effects. I've read some stories from people who have had it and many of them had a bad experience. I am 43 and generally have a healthy lifestyle but when I was younger I spent a lot of time in the sun. I have large pores and very oily skin which home and salon microdermabrasion doesn't improve.<br><strong>Violeta Ilic</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> When it comes to Thermage (a non-invasive skin-tightening procedure using radio frequency), I just feel that there isn't enough long-term safety data to make me recommend it as a procedure. However, Fraxel, which is a microscopic laser treatment to improve the skin's appearance, is turning into a favourite treatment option of professional dermatologists for many problems, including porous skin. But these are the big guns. With regard to your skin, without seeing it, and not being a qualified professional, I can only say that I am surprised that the dermabrasion is not doing anything. Have you given it enough time? Long-term sun damage will not be turned around in a second. </p> <p>Have you been to a professional dermatologist rather than a beauty salon for dermabrasion? If you live in or near London you might check out Marko Lens (<a href=\"http://www.markolens.com\">markolens.com</a>), who offers what he calls a Combined Oxy-Detox Treatment (\u00a3150), which a colleague of mine (pale, British skin-type) has described as 'a toe in the shallow end of chemical peels' and a treatment that worked for her. It doesn't use either AHA or glycolic acid and is tailored to your skin specifically in terms of strength. She reported bright, clarified skin, long-term improvement of the look and function of her skin over weeks and although she was red for a couple of hours, she went happily to dinner afterwards. </p> <p>You might also rethink the cleansers you are using: you need to use one with salicylic acid like Dr Nick Lowe's Purifying Foaming Cleanser, \u00a39.95 at <a href=\"http://www.boots.com\">boots.com</a>. Try using an exfoliator for the face several times a week or consider going to a therapist such as Sarah Chapman (106 Draycott Avenue, London SW3, <a href=\"mailto:sarah@sarahchapman.net\">sarah@sarahchapman.net</a>), who is experienced at dealing with sun-damaged skin.

What's new and worth it? <br><strong>Bridget Goss</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Conspicuous consumption doesn't feel good at the moment. But investing in innovation is always worthwhile. Cosmetics are a relatively inexpensive way for women to give themselves a bit of a lift in tough times and I've picked a few things (shown here) that are new and clever - so many things out there are just copies of something we've seen before.</p> <p>1. Marion Newman - the brilliant nail technician, who works on all the top fashion shoots, has devised a new concept - the INKredibles - water-based opaque nail varnish that you brush on with a pen and leave to dry for 10-20 seconds. The second stage involves a glossy topcoat that seals the colour in record time. If you've gone a bit over the edges with the first coat, it just washes off. Each colour comes in a set (\u00a322), which includes the colour, sealer, remover and moisturiser. The Gold Leaf colour is amazing. Exclusive to Selfridges, or <a href=\"http://www.mariannewmannails.com\">mariannewmannails.com</a>.</p> <p>2. Fabulous make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury has been working with Gail Frederici (of John Frieda fame) to produce a range of cosmetics called Myface. The idea is to choose colours and products that work with your skin tone. The compacts look like iPods and have music and web-inspired names. The Eyetouch eyeshadow contains a lot of pigment for the price, \u00a39.99. The range has just launched exclusively at Boots (<a href=\"http://www.myfacecosmetics.com\">myfacecosmetics.com</a>).</p> <p>3. Steam Cream is a cute and simple idea - a moisturiser made using a new steam-infused method. The claim is that it is more effective and nutritious, like steaming your vegetables rather than boiling them. It's very light but great for young skin and the pretty tins are collectable; \u00a39.95 for 75g: <a href=\"http://www.steamcream.co.uk\">steamcream.co.uk</a> and selected stockists.</p> <p>4.

  "<p>Scientists, politicians and animal rights campaigners will confront each other this week in a battle that will ultimately determine the future use of primates in medical research in Britain and the rest of the European Union.</p> <p>The public meeting - to be held in Brussels on Thursday - will mark the opening round of a campaign that could result in the EU banning experiments on macaques, marmosets and other monkeys in all member states.</p> <p>'It is quite clear a serious battle over primate research is about to begin,' said Oxford neuroscientist Tipu Aziz, who will speak at the meeting. 'We should be under no illusions about the impact of primate experiment ban, however. It would force us to abandon research that could lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease, strokes and many other illnesses.'</p> <p>Great apes - gorillas, chimpanzees and orang-utans - are no longer used in scientific experiments in Europe but other primates are involved in research into new drugs, surgical procedures and vaccines. Around 10,000 experiments, mainly on marmosets and macaques, are carried out every year, with Britain leading the field with an annual total of just under 4,000. </p> <p>In the case of Aziz, his experiments on primates taught him how to drive electrodes into the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, a process that produces instant relief from their symptoms. </p> <p>'Campaigners say other methods could be used to develop techniques like this,' he said. 'The claim is false. There is no alternative. More to the point, I have plans to treat motor neurone disease, Alzheimer's and stroke patients in a similar way, using electrodes, but if I cannot experiment on primates to find the right brain centres, I will not be able to do this.'</p> <p>Other groups disagree, however, including MEPs. Last year, they issued a declaration which demanded the establishment of a timetable for replacing primates in experiments. Many primate species face extinction, they argued, thanks to increased habitat destruction and eating of their flesh, known as bushmeat. 'It may be difficult to protect primates from [these] threats if it is perceived these species are used freely by Western academic institutions,' the MEPs warned.</p> <p>Their declaration was rejected by the European Commission, however. Primate research is unavoidable in developing treatments for auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, infections such as HIV and Sars and neurological illnesses such as Alzheimer's, the Commission stated in an official response.</p> <p>Now it is set to publish its draft proposals for updating legislation that controls animal experiments in Europe and these are expected to be announced at this week's meeting, before being debated by the European Parliament. The key and most contentious issue will concern primate experiments.</p> <p>'It will take months or even years for the new proposals to be hammered out,' said Mark Matfield of the European Coalition for Biomedical Research. 'Basically it will be passed back and forward between the European Commission and the European Parliament as they wrangle over the key clauses. Whatever the outcome, however, it will be binding on the UK.'</p> <p>While scientists insist that primate research is irreplaceable, groups such as the Dr Hadwen Trust for Humane Research argue that alternatives are feasible. 'It was claimed there were no alternatives to animal tests on cosmetics,' said trust official Nicky Gordon. 'But when these tests were banned, the industry quickly found alternatives. Banning primate experiments would concentrate scientists' minds in exactly the same way.'</p> <p>Last month, the trust - together with the Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (Frame) and the St Andrew Animal Fund - issued a report on replacing primates in medical research. 'Primates are often subjected to invasive and painful procedures and are restricted to a lifetime of laboratory incarceration: thus it is increasingly unethical to pursue such inadequate \"models\" of human illness,' the report states.</p> <p>It also argues that malaria vaccines have been developed and tested in primates but have all failed to generate immunity in humans. Similarly, the report attacks the use of experiments aimed at studying human cognition. Sections of brain are removed from primates and electrodes are implanted into their skulls in order to study psychological processes such as memory or perception. But advances in medical imaging mean that these processes can now be studied directly in humans without using monkeys. 'There is simply no need to use primates for this kind of work,' added Gordon.</p> <p>Ending the use of primates in experiments will not happen overnight, warned Vicky Robinson, head of the government-backed National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research. 'We need a strategy to develop alternatives. The crucial point is that we must move away from the rhetoric and start doing research that will lead to alternatives.'</p> <p>These points were disputed by scientists, however. 'Primates are the only creatures that suffer from human diseases like Hepatatis C,' said Simon Festing of the Research Defence Society. 'More than 100 million people are now infected with that virus and the effects can be devastating. The key point is that primates provide our only model for developing vaccines. Ban primate research and our hopes of dealing with the scourge of Hepatitis C will vanish.'</p> <p>Researchers also warn that if experiments on primates are banned in Europe, such research will merely be taken up in India, China and other countries where less rigorous standards of animal care are imposed. 'Monkeys are kept in the best possible conditions in Europe,' said Festing. 'That is not always the case in other nations.'</p> <p>These scientists fear that Europe - and Britain in particular - could lose its pre-eminent position as a world leader in medical research. Key work in neurological and infectious diseases would be thrown away to save a relatively small number of animals. 'We have cut back primate use to the very minimum,' said Festing. 'In the US, more than 60,000 experiments on primates are carried out every year, more than 10 times our level. The medical leads that we would give up by abandoning experiments on monkeys would be taken up across the Atlantic. We would gain nothing and lose a great deal.'</p> <p>This point was backed by Professor Roger Morris of King's College London. 'We should not forget that the few experiments we carry out on primates have the potential to alleviate a vast amount of human suffering. In the case of Parkinson's, a few thousand animals will help develop models that could prevent hundreds of thousands of people suffering lingering deaths, their brains etched from within, and whose families face terrible emotional suffering.'</p> <p>Officials say the decision to end or continue with primate research will take at least a year to reach as the debate echoes round the EU headquarters. Nevertheless, this week's meeting in Brussels is seen as crucial in deciding how the battle will develop. </p> <p>'In the long run, I am confident we will persuade the European Parliament to see sense and to continue with primate research,' said Aziz. 'However, I do despair of the constant battles that we have to fight just to continue to do good science and to save lives. These waves of anti-science we keep experiencing are disquieting.'</p> <h2>Are there alternatives to vivisection?</h2> <p>Primates represent only a small fraction of the animals used in scientific experiments. In 2007, just over <strong>3.2 million experiments</strong> on animals were carried out in Britain. Of these, mice, rats and other rodents formed the vast majority: 83 per cent. By contrast, primates were used in only a fraction of one per cent of experiments: <strong>just under 4,000 </strong>in total.</p> <p>'There are certain medical issues that can only be resolved by using primates,' says Simon Festing of the Research Defence Society. 'In particular, they are extremely useful for studying <strong>motor function</strong>. Macaques and marmosets use their hands like humans and therefore display the tremors and symptoms of illnesses like Parkinson's disease just as we do. You simply cannot reproduce a disease like that in a pig or a rodent.'</p> <p>Primates such as the great apes - gorillas, chimpanzees and orang-utans - are the closest biological relatives to humans but have <strong>complex social lives</strong> that makes their use in scientific experiments unacceptable in Europe today. By contrast, macaques and marmosets are considered by scientists to have less demanding social structures but are still similar enough to humans to be used in occasional experiments. </p> <p>Anti-vivisectionist protesters argue that such experiments involve <strong>unjustified cruelty on intelligent creatures</strong>. They say other approaches are now more likely to lead to the development of new drugs and treatments: <strong>cultures of human cells grown in laboratories</strong>, for example. 'These technologies could now take over the use of primates in research,' says Dr Nicky Gordon, of the Dr Hadwen Trust for Humane Research.</p> <p>But Festing disagrees: 'All approaches have their uses but none are perfect. We need to use every means at our disposal if we want to succeed in our battle against disease.'</p>",
  "<p>When the balaclava-clad paramilitary police officer pulled back a blanket covering the corpse, a group of women wailed, shielding their babies' eyes. The security guard, whose body had been left outside the 4/9 Minimart in Villa Foresta on the edge of Tijuana, had been shot repeatedly at point-blank range with what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon, his face and chest grated by gunfire into something more like a raw carcass on a hook. </p> <p>This was body number six last Monday night, and the sixth of what would become a total of 15 people murdered during less than 72 hours in this frontier city that acts as a portal from Mexico to California and vice versa. This is the front line in the 'narco-war' - savage, sanguine and sudden - that drug cartels are waging between each other and with the authorities. The war has claimed some 2,700 lives this year, and more than 6,000 since December 2006, when President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched Mexico's first serious offensive against the cartels who have traded for decades under a measure of government protection.</p> <p>The battle has been fought mainly along the 2,100-mile border between the United States and Mexico, the world's busiest frontier. As the body count has increased, so has the brutality of the killing. Corpses have been found severely tortured or decapitated, castrated, dipped in sulphuric acid or with their tongues cut out. </p> <p>Dr Hiram Mu\u00f1oz, chief forensic medical expert assigned to the homicide department in Tijuana, told The Observer how 'each different mutilation leaves a clear message. They have become a kind of folk tradition. If the tongue is cut out, it means they talked too much. A man who sneaked on someone else has his finger cut off and maybe put in his mouth. If you are castrated, you may have slept with the woman of another man. Decapitation is another thing: it is simply a statement of power, a warning to all. The difference is that in normal times the dead were \"disappeared\" or dumped in the desert. Now, they are displayed for all to see.' </p> <p>Last month 13 bodies with their tongues cut out were found across the road from the Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas secondary school. The principal, Miguel Angel Gonz\u00e1lez Tovar, said: 'It was terrifying, the children were terrified, the staff were terrified. And now we had to suspend some classes after this last warning. They gave me CCTV, but that does not work. They gave me an alarm button, but that is broken. We try to teach here, but we cannot be isolated from what is going on outside.' The illustrated project on the wall of one classroom was about global warming and gave guidance on what to do in a flood or hurricane. </p> <p>The new army-imposed chief of police in Tijuana, Lieutenant-Colonel Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola, talks of 'social terrorism' by the narcos, referring specifically to a threat last Tuesday that, if Marines did not leave town, the narco gangs would kidnap and kill schoolchildren. </p> <p>'All I can do is to increase a police profile in the community and schools, calm people down to avert the kind of social psychosis the narcos want to generate, physical presence to reassure people and intelligence to fight the criminals themselves', said Leyzaola. </p> <p>The war has also struck deep into the heart of Mexico, with macabre executions as far south as Chiapas. The magazine Proceso published a cover photograph of the country's entire political and military leadership under the headline 'Impotence', and concluded that 'the narco is now a national structure'. The leading campaigner against the drug cartels in Tijuana, Victor Clark Alfaro, talked last week about 'a war against society itself, at every level of life, school and community, with violence on the streets and even more sinister movements behind that violence, to create psychosis in society, and criminalise the economy'. </p> <p>The war has also spread into the US, with 135 arrests last month in a swoop against Mexican cartel operatives. </p> <p>The appalling and escalating level of violence is not only a response to Mexico's tardy counter-offensive against the drug gangs, but a symptom of fragmentation among the drug cartels themselves. </p> <p>Last week's bloodbath in Tijuana - taking the year's death toll for this city towards 600 - followed the arrest last Saturday of Eduardo Arellano F\u00e9lix, known better by his 'nom de narco' El Doctor - the last remaining fugitive of five brothers who ran Mexico's oldest, but now severely damaged, cartel. On Wednesday, the US State Department lodged a request for Arellano's extradition for trial in the United States, where he has been among the most wanted drug traffickers. </p> <p>That dramatic swoop on a Saturday afternoon targeted an Art Deco mansion in the upscale Misiones del Pedregal suburb. A deafening salvo of fire was aimed at the villa in what was presumed to be yet another shoot-out. The next day it was shown to have been the taking of Mexico's second most wanted drug lord into custody. He arrived - white-bearded and apparently dazed - for his ritual handcuffed appearance for television to join one of his surviving brothers, Javier, in the high-security Altiplano jail. </p> <p>Authorities on both sides of the border hailed the arrest as a triumph, the US Drug Enforcement Administration calling it the 'final demise' of the cartel founded by Mexico's first drug lord, Angel F\u00e9lix Gallardo, but run by the Arellano brothers since he was jailed in 1989. </p> <p>Others were slower to celebrate. The state of Baja California's new public prosecutor, Rommel Moreno Manjarrez said: 'We hope to be seeing the fall of the Arellano cartel. But we have no illusions that one cartel's misfortune is another's opportunity, and that rivals will be watching this situation in their own way. We are trying to see how this will play out and to battle against whatever moves are made. </p> <p>'We have had a serious problem of police corruption in the past, but are trying to purge this corruption from our forces, and are now able to fight this battle seriously, with the DEA helping in many ways, and with backing from our own government, which is different from the old political situation.' </p> <p>Cocaine trafficking from South America into the US (and much of Europe), and trafficking in Mexican-produced heroin and methamphetamine, became a Mexican near-monopoly during the 1990s, operated by four cartels, each controlling one of four main 'plazas', or routes into the US. </p> <p>The Texan sector belonged to the 'Gulf cartel' and its military wing, Los Zetas, comprised of former crack Mexican troops. A central passage through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was terrain dominated by the Ju\u00e1rez cartel and the giant plaza between Tijuana and California by the Arellano brothers and their sister Eneida who, the authorities presume, will assume command of the clan. </p> <p>But a fourth, unspecified, central-western plaza was run by the Alianza de Sangre (Alliance of Blood), or Sinaloa cartel, from the Pacific state of that name, way south of the border, where most of the other big traffickers also originate. This cartel was founded and is led by Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n, who split from Gallardo to rival him, was jailed in 1993, but dramatically escaped in 2001 and is now a fugitive and something of a narco folk hero. Guzm\u00e1n used the 2006 government offensive to lay claim to the entire border. The war that rages in Tijuana is largely between his rebels and those loyal to the Arellano family. Moreno says that an alliance forged in jail between the Sinaloa and Ju\u00e1rez cartels is also 'entirely finished', generating further chaos, and Sinaloa is taking on the Gulf cartel's Zetos with a trained army of its own, Los Negros (the Men in Black). </p> <p>Amid the carnage, a journey with three young women from the police forensic team is a harrowing experience. On the outskirts of Tijuana, another corpse has been found, visible by the green light of a petrol station. The windscreen of the victim's Ford Explorer (with California plates) is pitted with three bullet holes, and he seems to have made a run into the street, followed by 25 further shots. </p> <p>The scene of the next slaughter is the 9/4 minimart in Villa Foresta, where a blanket covers the remains of the security guard, with two more dead inside. There is wild sobbing from the women as the bullet-sprayed body outside is revealed, and those inside the store are brought out on stretchers and loaded into the white forensic department truck now carrying five dead bodies. </p> <p>The shop, it seems, was a stash for drugs being loaded for export in two presumed clavos (nails - the word used here for a car carrying drugs) intended to join the 65,000 that cross from Tijuana into San Diego every day, which the police in time tow away. </p> <p>Meanwhile heavy-set men arrive to look on from a slight distance, embracing each other in a way that suggests burdensome comradeship and solace, but little sadness. </p> <p>Tijuana's residents are struggling, with a remarkable degree of success, to lead a normal life. A recent study among local drug addicts shows an increase from 5,000 outlets and crack houses in 2004 to 20,000 now, and an estimated 200,000 young people in a burgeoning city of three million seriously addicted to hard drugs. Friday's newspapers reported yet another vast haul by the American authorities of 90lb of cocaine, crossing Tijuana's border to San Diego in a car driven by a Mexican burro, or mule. </p> <p>But the city teems with effervescent life for all the 'psychosis' the narcos wreak. The crowds of American tourists have vanished from the famous Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n, so the souvenir business is in trouble. And with the formerly flashy narcos now lying low, Tijuana's famous brothels and strip clubs are empty of all but the worst types, the girls gyrating mainly with one another. </p> <p>But like every other bar, the S\u00f3tano Suizo pub was heaving last Sunday (while Eduardo F\u00e9lix Arellano was airborne, handcuffed), for the climactic football match of the season Mexicans call 'El Cl\u00e1sico' between Club Am\u00e9rica of Mexico City and Chivas of Guadalajara. The teams unleash attack after attack in a tremendous game-to-the-death with Chivas winning 2-1.</p> <p>On Friday, slightly surreally given the week's murders, celebrations were being prepared for yesterday's Day of the Dead, an ancient rite inherited from Mexican tradition, entwining Roman Catholicism with Aztec lore of the 'Black Sun', which illuminates the underworld.</p> <p>The borderland remains a strong, exciting and potent place, in which the vast majority of people live and strive honestly. This frontier is too often defined, as Professor Tony Payan of El Paso university points out in an excellent book on the borderline, not by the people who live, flock to and work here, but by whatever is polemically useful to Washington. From there, argues Payan, successive administrations have illogically and disastrously entwined their failed border 'war on drugs' with the entirely separate 'wars' on undocumented immigration and terrorism. </p> <p>There is a strong sense that the region is paying the price for other people's greed. 'We are,' says Eligio Montes, police commander of Rosarito Beach, south of Tijuana, 'a cultural sandwich here on the border. And now we're squeezed between narcos from Sinaloa and Americans taking drugs.' </p> <p>My companion reporter, Jorge Fregosa, ends another rollercoaster drive on Thursday (to catch the army remove hand grenades from a blue plastic bin in a side street) by saying: 'This is my city, my country and that is my flag' - and he opens the sunroof the better to see it fly, defiantly vast, with its eagle, cactus, snake and legend, in the breeze and in America's face, at the border. </p> <p>'And every time they kill someone,' says Fregosa, who has seen that happen hundreds of times this year, 'it hurts me. because it hurts the place I love. The border pays the price, and now we are paying a higher price than ever.'</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2> <p><strong>December 2006</strong><br>A new federal police force is created to tackle drugs cartels; thousands of troops are deployed as part of a major anti-drug trafficking drive.</p> <p><strong>2008 </strong><br>Drug-related killings soar. Murders linked to organised crime leap to almost 1,400 in first five months of year.</p> <p><strong>May</strong><br>Attorney-General Eduardo Medina Mora says that the number of murders linked to organised crime had risen by 50 per cent, with thousands of people having been killed in the 18 months since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office and declared war on drugs cartels - 450 of the dead were police, soldiers or lawyers. </p> <p><strong>August</strong><br>As the murders continue, hundreds of thousands turn out for marches throughout Mexico to protest against the wave of kidnappings and killings.</p>",
  "<h2>Prison faith groups can unlock a door to life</h2> <p>I was pleased to see the work of Kainos discussed in 'Faith groups spreading the word in the wings' (Focus, last week). I have been a volunteer in the Kainos wing at Swaleside prison for seven years and am working on the opening talk in the Good Neighbour weekend this month. There will probably be no mention of God. The Kainos movement is Christian-based but not Christian-promoting. Other talks may be more specifically Christian but never in an aggressive or exclusive way.</p> <p>Prisoners only come on the wing if they want to do so. They do get more time out of their cells than usual, but I can only think of one prisoner who joined the course for purely cynical reasons. Incidentally, I don't think I have ever seen a prison with dormitories as mentioned in the article.</p> <p>I find the remarks of Frances Crook (of the Howard League) hard to understand. Prisoners are not particularly vulnerable people. (I don't find them particularly evil either.) What they do have is time to think about life. I suggest the analogy of the course as being like a tree. A man can attend to get possible brownie points, the leaves of the tree. Or he can pay attention to the course and learn to change his lifestyle, let that be the trunk. Or he might want to find the root, which is our faith. There is no pressure. Ms Crook has chosen not to believe the statistics that a Kainos course reduces reoffending. But they are official figures. Christ teaches that we cannot receive forgiveness unless we first forgive others. Please explain how that can 'inflame tensions within the prison service'.<br><strong>Alan Pentecost.</strong><br>Maidstone, Kent</p> <h2>Give Prescott some respect</h2> <p>Lynn Barber's feature on John Prescott (OM, last week) smacked of a writer trying to exact journalistic revenge because Prescott had said nasty things about her friends. Barber says: 'More than half the people I interview come from working-class or disadvantaged backgrounds and I have never, ever heard anyone whinge on about it the way Prescott does.' This seems an unfair remark to make about a person who is being interviewed principally to promote a documentary called Prescott: The Class System and Me. I'm not sure what else Lynn Barber would expect Prescott to talk about under the circumstances other than his class. It is a significant achievement for a man of his background to have become Britain's longest-serving Deputy Prime Minister. Prescott needs to be treated with more respect.<br><strong>Mike Watson</strong><br>London SE23</p> <h2>Be aware of Israel's imperialism</h2> <p>It would benefit clear thinking if people such as Rafael Behr and Denis MacShane, whose book he was reviewing ('Jew-baiting is alive and kicking', Review', last week) would realise that people criticise Israel not because it is Jewish but because it is imperialist, that it is discriminatory towards Palestinians and has created an apartheid system in the Palestinian territories. </p> <p>It's a bit odd to say that in the 1950s the Britain suspected Israel of being a Soviet puppet. In 1956, Anthony Eden went to war in alliance with Israel (and France) to crush the legitimate anti-imperialism of Nasser's Egypt. To judge from Behr and MacShane, their imperialism is alive and kicking.<br><strong>Christopher Walker</strong><br>London W14</p> <h2>Charity and the Old Vic</h2> <p>An article in last week's Observer News section about the Old Vic incorrectly stated that Sally Greene, our chief executive, 'owns' the theatre. Her generosity and entrepreneurial skill have contributed greatly to our achievements over the past four seasons. However, she was part of a group of donors who raised the funding to purchase the theatre in 1998 for the Old Vic Theatre Trust, a registered charity. </p> <p>While the company operates as a 'commercial' West End theatre, any profits are invested in the trust and the maintenance of the building. The misunderstanding about ownership can make it difficult to raise money as it sends out a confusing signal about our charitable status. We need all the money our generous supporters give!<br><strong>Kevin Spacey</strong><br>Artistic Director, Old Vic<br>London SE1</p> <h2>Pilates politics in perspective</h2> <p>Your story 'Pilates fanatics divided as founders square up in clash of the toned titans' (News, last week) was misleading. First, the dispute within the Body Control Pilates Group (BCPA) is not between Gordon Thomson and myself. The decision to ask him to resign as a director of BCPA was taken unanimously by its elected council and will be voted on by all of its members at an extraordinary general meeting.</p> <p> The only issue at stake is the decision by Gordon Thomson to establish a rival teacher membership body in January. The article gave the false impression that I disapproved of Gordon setting up his own style of teaching, in particular courses using machines. It also states that I only teach Pilates with mats. Both comments are totally incorrect. Simply, it is untenable for a serving director of one membership body to launch a rival body.<br><strong>Lynne Robinson</strong><br>Director, BCPA<br>London WC1</p> <h2>Harness hydro power</h2> <p>Keith Bristow (Letters, last week) has exposed politicians' blinkered thinking about combating climate change. Twelve miles from where I write, the River Goyt at Bollington is producing hydroelectric power using Archimedes' screws (a 3,000-year-old technology). Six miles away, at Styal, the old weir on the River Bollin is virtually intact and used to power the adjacent large cotton mill. So many rivers in Britain could be harnessed using small turbines made with government support by our struggling engineering companies.<br><strong>Russell Hickling</strong><br>Altrincham, Cheshire</p> <h2>The Games mean jobs</h2> <p>Unlike Nick Mathiason ('The Games thrilled. Now it's \"whatever\"', Comment, last week), as a resident of a borough that will be affected by a lot of the disruption of the Olympics I was against the bid. However, unlike Nick Mathiason, my enthusiasm has increased. He has ignored the unintended benefit, that the project will provide employment when the economy is in recession.<br><strong>Andrew Hudson</strong><br>London E10</p> <h2>Don't knock holiday fundraising</h2> <p>Catherine Bennett's article 'When they ask for sponsorship, tell them to get on their bikes' (Comment, last week) accuses charities of marketing glamorous holidays masquerading as fundraising. The reality is very different. The websites of Scope and Donkey Sanctuary (singled out for particular criticism) show that they are clear about the value of the benefit enjoyed by participants, inviting them to cover the costs themselves and/or to make it clear to potential sponsors the value of this. Raising \u00a3800 on a \u00a31,500 event represents \u00a3800 the charity would not otherwise have had.<br><strong>Richard Marsh</strong><br>Director, Impact Coalition, <br>Improving Accountability, Clarity and Transparency<br>Institute of Fundraising<br>London SW8</p> <h2>God will get you in the end</h2> <p>Interesting comments from your panel in answer to the question, 'Will God punish Transport for London?'

  "<p>It's been the biggest fashion story of the year and it's had nothing to do with harem pants, the coat versus the cape, or the alluring comeback of the brogue. An industry not known for its crises of confidence has been forced to ask itself some uncomfortable questions. Might there be something nearing apartheid inside the pages of the glossy magazines and on the runways of the international designer collections? Is fashion racist? </p> <p>The debate - some say long overdue - would not have been kick-started without a woman called Bethann Hardison. The first black saleswoman in the Garment District of New York in the Sixties and a runway model in the Seventies, she spent the Eighties and Nineties as one of the few black women with her own modelling agency (for black and white clients). She's so celebrated in the business that she's known mostly by her first name only, like Naomi and Iman, to each of whom she also happens to be a long-time confidante and mentor. </p> <p>Over the past 14 months she's held campaign meetings in New York to speak out about a subject that has been largely taboo in the fashion industry. These are protest groups like no other - a cross between a rumbustious church service and the coolest party you have ever been to. Here, the likes of Naomi Campbell, Liya Kebede, Iman, Tyson Beckford and Veronica Webb squeeze into a room with some of the fashion world's biggest players such as Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, editor-at-large of American Vogue and designer Vera Wang, as well as casting agents, stylists and representatives from the modelling agencies. </p> <p>At each meeting, Hardison sits at the front and beckons people she knows to stand up and speak. 'I knew I could make things happen,' she says. 'I knew I could make the rest of the industry feel self-conscious about what was going on.' Over the months her audiences revealed a fashion white-out - design houses that hadn't used a black model for a decade; issue after issue of American Vogue without a single black model on the fashion pages. Casting agents who stipulate 'No ethnics' this season. Magazine editors who say black covers don't sell. Caption writers who get the few black models who are successful mixed up. Designers who, out of a total of 30 models, use only two who are black because, 'If it's more than two it becomes a Black Thing'. Black models paid less than their white counterparts. As Iman said at one of the early groups: 'In any other industry it would be racism and you'd be taken to court for it.'</p> <p>Hardison had actually sold her agency and stepped out of fashion, preferring, she says, to lie in a hammock in Mexico and dance salsa with pretty skinny Latino boys. (She is, it swiftly transpires, not a typical sixtysomething. She won't tell me her exact age. 'Not even my doctor knows that!' she hoots.) It was Naomi Campbell who persuaded her to come out of retirement to organise the events. 'Every couple of months she'd ring me and say, \"There are no black girls out there. You've got to do something!\"' </p> <p>Hardison was in a unique position. She'd retired, which meant she had nothing to gain financially. She knew everyone. She was respected and well liked in a business renowned for being fickle and as ingrained with ego and jealousy as a designer logo on a leather handbag. Eventually she decided to act. She emailed Iman. 'Did you realise that, over the past decade, black models have been reduced to a category? Call me.'</p> <p>We sit in her small apartment near Bryant Park in New York, a short walk from the Garment District where she started out working for a button company. Paintings, mostly of black women, line the walls; there's a large framed poster from Andy Warhol's American Indian Series. She is, she tells me, exhausted. Something to do with the fact that yesterday she held another campaign meeting, and that she's fasting because it is the month of Ramadan. </p> <p>What irks her most about the lack of diversity on the catwalks is the fact that 'we'd had it before and it had disappeared'. In the late 70s and early 80s, she recalls, on the back of the black civil-rights movement, catwalks and magazines were often more diverse than they are now; black models were the stars.</p> <p>'Once you've climbed to the top of the mountain you don't expect to be back at the bottom again. It's like once you've seen Paris it's hard to go back to the farm. We had been there. We had achieved all of this' - she sits up straighter, tilting her chin imperiously and I catch a glimpse of how arresting she must have been as a 20-something woman striding down a runway for Oscar de la Renta or Halston - 'and we'd disappeared'.</p> <p>Casual observers might wonder why this issue is important, why anyone cares who's wearing a \u00a32,500 coat in a magazine fashion spread or on a catwalk since most of us will never be able to afford it anyway. According to Hardison: 'Fashion should be a reflection of society. I want my industry to be as modern as the next one. And my industry is the least modern of them all. Fashion isn't just about the way a dress moves.' The concern is that a generation of girls, both black and white, will grow up thinking there is only one - white - benchmark for beauty.</p> <p>It seems astonishing to think that, in two days' time, America may elect its first black president, but the editor of a glossy magazine might still think twice about putting a beautiful black woman on the front cover. Or even, indeed, on the inside pages, thanks to the current fascination with celebrity that means a famous person (usually a white, fake-tanned one) bags the cover slot. Thus the number of new, well-known black or Asian models has shrunk to a handful: Jourdan Dunn, Chanel Iman, Sessilee Lopez, Georgie Badiel. On Forbes magazine's 2007 list of the 15 top-earning models, only one - Liya Kebede - was black.</p> <p>Trying to work out why fashion seems to have gone backwards on diversity is complex.</p> <p>Everyone blames everyone else - model agencies blame casting directors, magazine editors blame readers, designers blame model agencies. The reasons range from the aesthetic to the more insidious.</p> <p>'I don't think in terms of black and white,' stylist Katie Grand tells me. 'I just think about who is going to look best in the clothes.' The fashion designer Katharine Hamnett claims to be baffled by the situation. 'The strange thing is that Caucasian girls actually got the short straw. Very few of them are model material. Black girls and Indian girls have far better faces and far better figures than white girls, period. I remember taking my kids to India and looking out of the bus window and saying, \"My God, this is like a model casting\". Why white girls remain so popular is a mystery to me, whether it's because consumers are mostly white, or aspire to be white, I don't know.'</p> <p>In America, where 30 per cent of the population is non-white and where black women spend a colossal $20 billion on fashion and cosmetics, the issue is particularly sensitive. Other American media, including some hit television dramas, reflect a society that is racially mixed, but the fashion industry remains as pale as a partially cooked chicken drumstick. American Vogue, with a readership of two million, has, in particular been criticised for its scarcity of black images.</p> <p>'We still have reactionary forces in this country,' says Veronica Webb, one of the most successful black American models in the Eighties and the first to land a major cosmetics contract for Revlon. 'And they are part of our power base. It's our national ailment. To be told \"no\" simply because of your colour means you are screwed ... And it wasn't even so bad for me because I am very mixed - part black, part African, part Latino.' </p> <p>Nevertheless she recalls being turned down for a job for a leading French design house. 'The photographer, who was a friend, told me the client didn't want their accessories to become status symbols in the black community.'</p> <p>I repeat this story to other black commentators in the industry and it's so typical they don't even sound surprised. Former model Beverly Bond has set up a group for black teenage girls called 'Black Girls Rock', an attempt to attach a slogan to the protest in the same way that 'Black is Beautiful' did in the Seventies. 'I've been to auditions where they automatically turn away the black girls without even looking at their books. It's racist. Imagine them behaving that way if I went to a job interview. It's amazing how far behind the fashion world is and how they can get away with being so blatant about it.'</p> <p>She's given up modelling and become a well-known DJ instead. 'In the end black models get disheartened by it. No matter how hot you look, you are never going to be hot enough.'</p> <p>In July, no doubt partly because of Bethann Hardison's campaign, Italian Vogue published what they called 'a black issue'. Every page of editorial was devoted to black beauty (while the advertising remained almost universally white). It included many of the best black models of the past 30 years, from ground-breakers like Pat Cleveland to Jourdan Dunn, said to be the new Naomi Campbell. (It seems there's little chance of there being room for two very successful black models at the same time.) The result was dazzling, although the website Gawker noted wryly: 'Never has the racism issue looked so stunning.'</p> <p>For the first time in its history the magazine sold out, helped by a campaign on Facebook by black readers starved of the black image for long enough. The issue made newspaper headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Commentators said it showed, finally, that the black image could sell. Critics noted that the majority of the models were pale-skinned, their hair often slicked back or hidden in a turban. True, black women don't all look the same - and thinking they do is part of the problem - but there were few images of darker skin and natural afro hair. </p> <p>With a circulation of 145,000, Italian Vogue's readership is edgy and niche. Editor Franca Sozzani can afford to take risks. Rivals may have sat up and taken notice but most probably thought, 'Fabulous publicity. I wish I'd thought of that!' And then carried on as before.</p> <p>Some felt that it was too little too late. 'There's nothing I like more than to see beautiful black people,' says Rebecca Carroll, author of Sugar in the Raw, about black teenage girls in America, 'but it felt a bit like black history month - \"Now we've done it we don't have to worry about it again\".' Black stylist and fashion editor Edward Enninful disagrees. He worked on the issue: 'I'd love it if fashion was 50/50 between black and white. But you have to think in terms of baby steps. In the end little drops make an ocean.'</p> <p>Whenever designers and stylists enter the debate many talk about the cyclical nature of the business and how trends come and go. However, even if this is the case, change is achingly slow. Katie Grand worked on five shows last season and struggled to find the quality of black models she wanted. 'I think the agencies could do more,' she says. 'I saw every girl but there were very few black girls.' At Louis Vuitton, out of a total of 54 models, she used only four that were black. </p> <p>At the recent collections in September Chanel still had no black models; nor did Yohji Yamamoto, Giorgio Armani, Marni or Jil Sander. </p> <p>Balenciaga, Gucci, Christian Lacroix and Prada had one each. The vast majority used just two or three (at least, everyone said, it was better than last year) although many were only seen on the runway once. Jean Paul Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood, famously fans of a mixed cabine, broke through the 20 per cent ceiling. </p> <p>One up-and-coming designer, Sophie Theallet, stood out - her whole show was made up of only black models. It was a success but, as she tells me: 'I told nobody beforehand - only my husband and the people closest to me at work. It was too risky. I didn't want anyone telling me it was not a good idea.' And this in a spring/summer collection when, as Bethann Hardison points out, black models traditionally do much better. 'The bright colours against the dark skin ...' she says, rolling her eyes. When she was an agent she used to ring up the design houses and say: 'You know we do wear clothes in winter time?'</p> <p>People in the fashion and media industry who know Bethann describe her as an icon. Admittedly fashion has its fair share of luvviness, but watch her at her meetings and the affection people feel for her is obvious. Both inspiring and outspoken without being self-righteous, she's able to rouse and provoke in equal measure, poking fun at a business that she clearly loves but one which takes itself rather too seriously at times. </p> <p>However, her background had little to do with designer shops on Madison Avenue. Hardison's father, a practising Muslim, was a supervisor in the local housing authority. After her parents separated she was looked after by her mother and grandmother who were domestics in Brooklyn. 'You've got to leave Brooklyn,' she says, 'to be proud of where you come from.' Her mother loved the local bar scene, dancing and dressing up - 'Though in those days, the Fifties, everybody dressed in the same silhouette, whether they were black or white.' </p> <p>Hardison fell pregnant at the age of 18 - 'I had never had sex before and I got pregnant on the first time, which is the worst thing in the world.' When her baby son, Kadeem, was small, her mother and grandmother looked after him (he grew up to become a successful actor, based in Los Angeles) and for a while she had a mixture of jobs working at a telephone company and in a prison before she found a position in a firm that made hand-painted buttons for design houses.</p> <p>She'd inherited her mother's sense of style. 'That first day I wore a white straw hat, a one-off white suit, slingback shoes. The owner was worried I'd get covered in paint so he decided I could be the one to take the buttons to the designers.' It would be true to say she never looked back. Hardison worked her way up through an industry that back then was focused on a few streets in midtown Manhattan. She was an assistant for a dress company, which meant she was secretary, receptionist and book-keeper. Finally two Jewish women who ran a salon allowed her to be the first black saleswoman in the Garment District. The idea of a white woman with money to spend being shown the collection in the showroom by a black woman was unheard of.</p> <p>Hardison's hair was cropped short, as it is now. She was also very skinny. 'Boy was I skinny! Big eyes. I looked like I was from Biafra.' Her unusual look came to the attention of some of the designers she met at work. 'I wasn't a pretty girl but there was something about me that attracted them.' </p> <p>Her debut as a model was in the early Seventies for a designer called Chester Weinberg. The audience, made up of industry buyers, was wholly white. 'They looked stunned. I looked like a little African girl. There were a few other girls of colour but they had a sort of bounce about them. I was just straight.' By the third outfit the uproar was so loud, she could barely get to the end of the room. 'I was dying inside. I wanted to walk right through the door onto the subway and go home. But somehow I kept my head up and it became a point of defiance. I wouldn't let them see how much they hurt me. That became my style. They had never seen anyone who looked like me but that defiance changed the way models could look.'</p> <p>It wasn't long before black models were in demand. 'They called us the black stallions. Black or white it didn't matter. It was a great time because it was so creative and stylish and bohemian. You didn't have to have lots of money to be at the party.' Sensibly - and Hardison, you come to realise, has a very sensible head on those shoulders - she never gave up her day job. By this time she was working as a design assistant. She knew everyone from the Studio 54 crowd to Truman Capote, Jerry Hall to Woody Allen, but, as she says: 'There wasn't a lot of bullcrap then. All you had to do was have interesting dinner-party conversation.'</p> <p>A man once told her she was too busy to be committed to a relationship and, though she was married twice, neither marriage lasted long. In the Eighties she decided to start her own modelling agency. She found premises in the then unfashionable SoHo area of New York. 'As a black businesswoman you can't believe anyone is taking you seriously because you have no one before you who has done what you are doing. It's like walking down the Yellow Brick Road before it's been laid.' She would run the agency for 21 years and set up a pressure group called Black Girls' Coalition with Iman. By the time she sold up there may not have been parity between white and black models but she imagined she'd done enough.</p> <p>The industry changed with the influx of Eastern-European models. Bewitching-looking women: tall, translucent, angular, with flinty cheekbones and piercing eyes. 'They flooded the market,' says Carole White, who owns Premier Model Management. 'They are beautiful, but it is a bland beauty. It's a certain look. We can all spot it.' As a reaction to the reign of the supermodels, labels like Jil Sander and Prada wanted anonymous faces. 'It was almost as though they were revolted by what they had created,' says Michael Gross, the author of Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women. According to Hardison: 'The model was reduced to a coathanger.' </p> <p>Of 200 models on White's books, only seven are black or Asian women and she says they have to work twice as hard to get the jobs. White thinks that fashion has become dominated by a white aesthetic that goes beyond the designers. 'Photographers used to be apprenticed for five years. They would learn about lighting and printing,' she explains. 'The thing is that now they probably use digital cameras and don't know how to light a black girl. It's the same with make-up artists. Black make-up artists like Pat McGrath work magic on white models but you don't see it the other way around. It's probably ignorance, and they are probably frightened. They just don't know how to do it.' </p> <p>There is an unspoken presumption that white readers want white models, white women only want to see an image of themselves on the catwalks. It's what academics call 'the white hegemony' and it's so casual if you're white you don't even notice it. But might the pundits be talking down to their consumers?</p> <p>'Editors say customers won't have it, it won't sell,' says Barbara Summers, a black model in the Seventies and the author of Black and Beautiful and Open the Unusual Door. 'But it's self-defeating. They're projecting their own failure and using black people to make the excuse. It's just cowardice. The irony is that the industry is shrinking in the current financial crisis. It can't grow again if it stays stuck in these past ideas. You can't expand your customer base if you only make products for white girls.' </p> <p>The result, according to Rebecca Carroll, is black teenage girls growing up thinking that they're not admired, a sense that goes beyond what they see in the mirror. 'It's painful,' she says. 'No one likes to be excluded and they grow up thinking they don't exist, therefore people don't care.'</p> <p>Even if one goes along with the view that Italian Vogue was, as Enninful says, 'historic and monumental', look through this month's bunch of British monthly glossies and you'd be hard pressed to find any black images. Editors often maintain that the number of black models they include proportionately matches the population. However, in this month's British glossies, the main fashion spreads are universally white. </p> <p>When you do see black models in magazines the same tropes are repeated again and again, says Zoe Whitley. She is a curator and visiting fellow at Sussex University, whose MA thesis was about blackness in Vogue. In mainstream magazines there is traditionally a proliferation of leopard-print and other animalistic symbols. Certain postures are popular - crawling, leaping in the air and smiling. There are lots of accessories and jewellery and colours that deliberately show up the contrast between fabric and skin - vivid reds, turquoise, white. 'The stories can be stunning,' says Whitley, 'but you don't often get a sense that you'd see a black model in a story about tweed, or a muted palette.' </p> <p>The alternative is to create an atmosphere of exoticism by putting a white model in a foreign environment like an African country or India. 'She becomes exotic and they don't even have to resort to using a black model.'</p> <p>Whitley has a theory that, when a black image is used on the front of a glossy magazine it is often in February, traditionally the lowest-selling month anyway. 'The poor sales become a self-fulfilling prophesy.' As a young woman growing up in Washington and Los Angeles, her family would rush out to buy any magazine with a black person on the front. They imagined they could boost sales single-handed.</p> <p>The lack of black images prompts some commentators to wonder whether magazines are interested in black readers at all. Fashion is a business and like all businesses it goes where it thinks the money is. 'This is a commercial industry,' says Michael Gross, 'run by a bunch of old people. Their job is not to change the world, it is to sell frocks. It's not racism. It's not even unconscious racism. It's an utter cluelessness about the real world.'</p> <p>There is a view, though, that if Senator Barack Obama does win on Tuesday, the response will be profound, even on cosseted, inward-looking Planet Fashion. Michelle Obama has wowed the industry with her fashion instincts. She's already reinvented the way a potential First Lady can dress. She might soon be the most sought-after woman on any glossy magazine front cover anywhere in the world. True, she's not a model but it could mark a sea change. 'It will be a wake-up call,' says Gross. 'The reaction in the fashion business will be a blatant and almost laughable attempt to catch up. Such is this craven industry and such is the way they behave.'</p>",
  "<p>Britain is renowned as a nation of animal-lovers, happy to fork out vast sums of money on their four-legged friends, but there are fears that, as households tighten the purse strings in the wake of the credit crunch, this could be changing. </p> <p>Worrying new findings from Sainsbury's Bank show that 1.6 million pet owners have put their dogs and cats to sleep over the past five years because they couldn't afford the veterinary fees or continuing medical costs of looking after their animals, while 2.5 million people admitted they had declined recommended treatment for their pets because they simply couldn't afford it. </p> <p>One of the key issues is the rising cost of vet fees - around 12 per cent per year - according to Sainsbury's Bank. Saga's pet insurance division puts the average vet bill for a dog at just over \u00a3300, with owners having to pay up to \u00a34,000 for some fractures and up to \u00a310,000 over several years if a pet had a more complicated condition, such as a tumour or spinal disorder. </p> <p>One of the simplest ways for a pet owner to manage unwelcome costs is by taking out insurance. However, as many as 11 million pet owners have no cover for their animals, the Sainsbury's findings show.</p> <p>'Our findings are very disturbing but also frustrating because in many cases, if the owners had taken out good quality pet insurance, they would have been able to treat their pet without any problems,' says Neal Devine of Sainsbury's Bank. 'The credit crunch could compound this situation even further, with as many as one million pet owners looking to reduce their pet insurance cover, or do away with it altogether.'</p> <p>The good news is, reasonable quality cover can come at an affordable price: figures from price comparison service <a href=\"http://www.Moneysupermarket.com\">Moneysupermarket.com</a> show you can get cover from as little as \u00a34.51 per month for a cat and \u00a36.84 for a dog with Tesco Insurance. 'You don't want to pay over the odds for it, but don't want to be caught without it, so it is crucial to read the small print on what exactly is included and excluded,' says Peter Gerrard from Moneysupermarket.com. 'Make sure you check the excess and also the levels of vets' fees cover and third-party liability.'</p> <p>The aim of pet insurance is to ensure you are covered for vet fees, but can also include death cover, emergency kennel or cattery fees, pet-minding, advertising and reward for a lost pet, holiday cancellation and even bereavement counselling. However, everyday costs such as vaccinations, nail clipping, spaying and neutering are not usually included. </p> <p>When choosing your cover, it's worth noting that there are different types of policy. 'A \"lifetime\" policy will pay for all treatment without a time limit,' says Brian Brown, of financial analyst Defaqto. 'These policies are more expensive, and are designed to cover ongoing conditions, such as skin problems, arthritis, and kidney problems.' The Halifax, for example, offers this cover provided the pet has not been diagnosed with a pre-existing condition when the policy is taken out. </p> <p>The second type is a '12-month' policy places a limit on time for which any single condition can be claimed; after 12 months, the insurer will stop paying for that condition and it will be excluded from cover in the future. 'These 12-month policies are usually a lot cheaper, and useful for paying for emergency treatment such as road accidents,' says Brown. 'But these policies do not provide the same long-term peace of mind.' A third alternative is a policy with limits on the total amount that can be claimed. </p> <p>When choosing, don't be tempted to skimp, as a cheaper premium can mean compromised cover, plus, if your pet is prescribed medication for the rest of its life, you could be picking up the tab when the policy runs out. </p> <p>It's worth noting that when it comes to cover, dogs cost more to insure than cats, pedigrees will be more expensive to insure than ordinary mutts or moggies - and costs will be higher for certain breeds. 'Labradors, for example, are notorious for having health problems that develop with age,' says Gerrard. </p> <p>At the same time, geographic location may have an impact on the premium, as will the age of your pet. </p> <p>Finally, if you are insuring a dog, it is important to ensure that your policy covers your liability if your pet injures someone else. 'If this happens, you may be liable to pay damages,' warns Brown. 'Most pet policies include this as standard, but you should check.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Brightblack Morning Light<br>Motion To Rejoin (Matador) \u00a310.99</strong></p> <p>Anyone sorely missing the narcotic languor of the old Spiritualized should buy a copy of Brightblack's third record immediately. In theory, an album recorded in an adobe dwelling in the New Mexico desert using only solar panels doesn't spell blissed-out decadence; neither does the Utopian hippie-speak of the lyrics. But Brightblack draw from the same heady well of Southern soul as Jason Pierce used to. And the stunning combination of Rachael Hughes's cloudy Fender Rhodes piano, singer Nabob Shineywater's multi-tracked whisper and some dazed horns makes for an addictive experience.<br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></p> <p><strong>Grace Jones<br>Hurricane (Wall of Sound) \u00a311.99</strong></p> <p>The disco diva's first album in almost 20 years has been preceded by festival<br>appearances and press interviews so fantastically bonkers that it's a mild anticlimax to find her treading well-worn Jones territory on record. Reggae grooves skank, she growls threatening sweet nothings, and despite the eccentricity on display, first impressions are at best nostalgic, at worst parodic. But these tracks work a slow-drip charm; opener 'This Is' delivers terrific, edgy funk, 'Hurricane' has Jones's vocals swooshing in like the titular storm, and there's a rarely glimpsed vulnerability to 'I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)'.<br><strong>Ally Carnwath</strong></p> <p><strong>Girls Aloud<br>Out of Control (Fascination) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>With umpteen hits and glowing reviews to their name, Girls Aloud (or production stringpullers Xenomania) could be forgiven for reaching creative exhaustion. Certainly, their fifth LP begins wearily; 'The Promise' rides the Sixties soul bandwagon to unpromising effect, while the Pet Shop Boys-penned 'The Loving Kind' is almost indistinguishable from 2007's 'Call<br>the Shots'. Mostly, though, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is swept aside by their insouciant charm and iron-clad hooks, with the swooshy electro-disco of 'Turn to Stone' and hip-swinger 'Love is the Key' proving highlights. They remain a potent pop force.<br><strong>Hugh Montgomery</strong></p> <p><strong>Littlejoy<br>Littlejoy (Rough Trade ) \u00a311.99</strong></p> <p>The latest Strokes side project is the sound of a New Yorker succumbing to the California breeze. With his band on hiatus, drummer Fab Moretti headed to LA for a change of scene and hooked up with fellow songwriters Binki Shapiro and Rodrigo Amarante. Littlejoy does have the odd Strokes moment ('Keep Me in Mind' contains traces of Manhattan garage-rock DNA) but the sunny harmonies and gentle bossa nova flourishes suggest that relocation has had a heady effect. The songs are over before they've begun but each leaves a warm, uplifting impression. A carefree summer album at odds with the season of its release.<br><strong>Killian Fox</strong></p> <p><strong>Harry Beckett<br>The Modern Sound of (On U Sound ) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>Beckett's trumpet and flugelhorn have been a constant on the British jazz scene since the 1950s but here he ventures into new territory, exploring dub grooves with producer Adrian Sherwood. This proves a startling success. Sherwood keeps the ambience restrained and slinky while Beckett plays long lyrical lines interspersed with fiery outbursts. Joining the Barbados-born horn player are talents like Orphy Robinson, while Sherwood throws in a couple of turns from the late reggae singer Junior Delgado. The album occasionally recalls Miles Davis's funk experiments, though it could only be a British-Caribbean fusion.<br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p> <p><strong>Joe Zawinul<br>75th (BHM) \u00a315.99</strong></p> <p>This double CD, recorded live at last year's Lugano Festival, catches the unique, multi-ethnic Zawinul Syndicate in its full glory. A bewildering but delightful mixture of world music and high-tech electronics, this seven-piece band comes close to achieving Zawinul's aim of sounding 'like folk instruments that haven't been discovered yet'. His own keyboard playing is as inventive and surprising as ever, and the band is joined by Wayne Shorter on soprano saxophone for a notable version of the classic 'In A Silent Way'. The concert was on 7 July , Zawinul's 75th birthday. He was terminally ill and died less than two months later.</p> <p><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",
  "<p>I was bathing Lacey one night and she said, \"Nanny, could Mummy die if she carries on taking drugs and drinking?\" And I said, \"Yes, she could, but we're going to work very hard to get her better.\" You have to reassure them, but not lie to them. Anyway, she must have been mulling it over because a few weeks later she asked me about it again. \"You know if Mummy dies,\" she said, \"and you're getting older and you die, who will take us?\"' Jan Patterson, 61, pauses for a moment and shakes her head. 'A lot of these children are really worried and anxious you know... Traumatised, actually.'</p> <p>Jan is likely to be traumatised herself and not just from fielding such stark lines of inquiry. For the past five or so years, she has been a 'kin carer' to her granddaughters, Lacey, 10, and Tia, 6, who she took from their mother, her own daughter Heidi, after many years of trying to monitor an increasingly chaotic and dangerous situation. Heidi and the girls' father were long-term drug users. They started with heroin and then moved on to crack cocaine which is when, Heidi says, things really fell apart. 'I kind of got by before that; you have a couple of bags of heroin every day and that's it. You're OK as long as you have enough money to score, but when you use crack you can never get enough of it... 20, 30, 40 stones, you just want more and more. Hit after hit.' She started using crack after giving birth to Tia and it wasn't long before she was selling it but using more and more so that the profits were less and less and soon... well soon, she says, in something of an understatement, they weren't functioning. A rough sketch of life in the eye of the storm: 'I was spending \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 a day on drugs, stealing because I never had enough money. All sorts coming through the house. I weighed 3st less than I do now and at one point I got busted for a large amount of heroin and only escaped prison by the skin of my teeth.' She was also in charge of a baby and a toddler.</p> <p>In this country, around 300,000 children are growing up in houses where one or both parents are addicted to drugs. Some experts put the number as high as 400,000, but no official figures exist. These children are typically exposed to drug taking, drug paraphernalia, petty and serious crime. One unsurprising outcome is that they commonly do less well at school, often displaying signs of hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder. They are also seven times more likely than other children to use drugs themselves. Professor Marina Barnard from the Centre for Drug Misuse at Glasgow University and advisor to the Home Office among others, says that even a brief look through the literature on the effects that drug problems can have on a family 'illustrates the reach into every important aspect of family functioning and dynamic. Children of parents with drug problems face numerous obstacles to achieving even the basics needed for their safety and wellbeing.'</p> <p>Lacey, in particular, was badly affected by her parents' drug use because she is the oldest and so lived through much more of 'the madness' as Heidi calls it. Heidi says she knows now that both girls were 'seriously lacking in love and affection'. She tells me, appalled herself now, that Lacey was often frightened as well. 'That poor little kid was scared.' Of what, particularly? 'People who came round, stuff like that.' When she eventually came to live with Jan, her grandmother promised her: 'Nobody we don't like will ever come into this house. This is our house and we'll keep it just for us.'</p> <p>Today, Lacey is a shy and preoccupied child who sometimes - less, nowadays - displays considerable anger towards her mother. She doesn't like talking about her mother's drug use but Jan says Lacey has given her snapshots from her childhood - of having to get biscuits from a high cupboard if 'Mummy and Daddy wouldn't get up and I was hungry'. Of leaving a stool she took down from the bathroom wedging the front door open when she went out to play, because her parents - when they were out of it - couldn't be relied upon to hear her knocking to get back in.</p> <p>Over the years Jan tried on a number of occasions to get social services involved. 'As I got increasingly concerned I approached the police and social services, but nobody seemed to want to know. I've found, along with other grandparents I know in similar situations, that social services are reactive, not proactive.'</p> <p>In fact they did visit sporadically but Heidi was always prepared, had food in the cupboards, appeared to be functioning. ('I was a good liar,' she says). But one morning Jan could take the torment and worry no longer. ('I lay awake for months and months waiting for the police to come round and tell me that something had happened to Heidi or the kids.') Enough was enough. Arriving unannounced, Jan's sister found Heidi unconscious in bed and her partner in a similar state. The girls, then one and five, were effectively looking after themselves. They were removed from the home there and then and have lived with Jan ever since.</p> <p>We have here in the UK an unusually severe drug problem when compared with the rest of Europe. To address this, policy and service provision has predominantly focussed on meeting the needs of the drug-taking individual, in the hope and belief that helping the addict will help everyone involved, and in the process put a stop to the attendant crime and health issues that often accompany drug use. So far, so good, but there is now plenty of evidence to suggest that we have been leaving other affected family members sidelined, invisible even, by not having the resources available to make them a focus of attention as well. </p> <p>In her book Drug Addiction and Families (Jessica Kingsley, 2007), Marina Barnard talks of 'a lamentable myopia that has led to a situation where the harm that accrues to families through a close relative's drug problem remains hidden, not because they are not there to view, but because we have chosen not to see.' A Channel 4 documentary called Mum Loves Drugs, Not Me (screened November 3) seeks to redress the balance a little, focusing as it does on the children of drug users and their kin carers (typically grandmothers), who take over when a user stops functioning.</p> <p>Heidi is 40 now and stable. She has been clean for 14 months and wants eventually to have her daughters living with her. She would like to go back to being an interior designer, as she was before she began taking drugs. She tells me she didn't really want to do the programme or this article, but respects her mother's wishes to draw attention to the lack of support both she and the children have faced in their extremely challenging circumstances.</p> <p>Jan and other grandmothers in the programme have fallen foul of the lack of clear and cohesive legislation around financing for women (and it usually is women) who suddenly find themselves faced with the prospect of bringing up a family for the second time. One of the key complaints most often vocalised by these grandparents is that they have to fight to get any payment at all and then don't get as much money as foster parents. An irony indeed when you consider that often the only thing between the child of a drug user and care is a grandparent. Yet we won't pay them as much as the foster carer the child might end up with if they weren't prepared to step in.</p> <p>When Jan took on the girls she didn't even have a home. 'I'd been working abroad and living with my sister since I'd been back. I did get a Salvation Army Housing Association place quite quickly, but it wasn't big enough - Tia had to sleep in with me for a while. I had nothing to put in the place. I relied on charity and friends and family donations, after I'd spent all my savings. Foster carers get around \u00a3350 per week per child. I get \u00a3200 for both of them.'</p> <p>The whole area of financial support for kin carers is fraught with incoherence and confusion. In some rare cases grandparents are initially assessed and paid as foster carers, but they are more usually encouraged to apply for Residence Orders because this gives them more parental rights over their grandchildren at a time when stability is desperately needed. The catch 22 is <br>that once a Residence Order has been established, carers are moved on to a system where any payment that might be made (and many kin carers get no payment at all) is discretionary. The Residence Order generally marks the end of practical social work support as well. 'You walk in and the government walks away,' as one grandmother puts it. </p> <p>Inevitably it is charitable and voluntary organisations that fill the void. Jan now does a lot of campaigning work on behalf of kin carers with a support group that has been of particular help to her: Pada (Parents Against Drug Abuse), now a national organisation which has a group in Liverpool near where she lives. 'I don't think I'd be where I am today without them,' she says. 'I go once a month for a pamper day. I get my hair done, have a facial or a massage. They're are wonderful.'</p> <p>Pat McDermott, 52, is from Burnley in Lancashire and has a similar story to Jan's, except that she has no contact with her daughter now ('I don't want to see her, she doesn't exist for me any more'). She has been the sole carer for her grandsons, Daniel, 13, and Kyle, 12 (whose father died of an overdose in 2001), for seven years now, since social services took them away from her daughter, who had used drugs on and off for years. Pat receives \u00a3541 a month Residence Allowance for the boys and she also works as a part-time cleaner. She is desperately put upon and alone in her circumstances, aside from a local support group called New Era that she visits once a month. 'Apart from that, I get no help at all. When I phone social services they say the case is closed.'</p> <p>What seems to go largely ignored is that these children are clearly damaged by their experiences and yet we expect ageing and exhausted grandmothers to deal with this on their own. When I ask Pat what the boys want to happen in the future, she laughs. 'They want to go on The Jeremy Kyle Show,' she says, 'because they've got questions they'd like to ask their mum.' In the Channel 4 documentary, Kyle describes his mother as, 'Horrible. Violent. She locked us in our rooms.' He worries that she might find out where they live, 'come in the back, get some ladders, break in and take me and Daniel.'</p> <p>In 2003 Marina Barnard and her colleague, Professor Neil McKeganey, contributed to a major government inquiry into the impact on children of drug-using parents - a report called, appropriately enough, Hidden Harm. 'I do think it's shameful,' McKeganey says now, 'that apart from a statement to say that they (children) are a priority, nothing has changed. It's exasperating and intolerable. The government has failed them because addressing their needs is expensive and there is no short-term answer... some of these children will need help into their teens. There is a lot of rhetoric around this, but really these children are no better off than they were five or six years ago.'</p> <p>In their new 10-year drug strategy launched last February, the government did outline a commitment to putting families first when dealing with drug problems. When I asked the Department for Children, Schools and Families how this commitment would be honoured with specific regard to the children of drug users and their kin carers, a spokesperson said: 'We are working with parents to improve the training available to children's services to help them spot the signs and get these children the support they need.' They are also currently 'developing support materials and advice for grandparents and other family members who take on a caring role for the children of someone with a drug problem.' They also observed that, 'In order to continue to make a sustained difference and long-term impact we have to engage better with families.'</p> <p>Carmella is the youngest child of a drug user to appear in the documentary. She was born on 6 August this year and lives with her mum April, 21, at her grandmother Sherrie's house near Nottingham. April went off the rails at 15, almost certainly as a result of a catastrophic incident in her childhood. When she was six her father murdered her older (step) sister Leah, while she was asleep in the same room. Sherrie doesn't really know why he did it. 'He rang me at work - I was doing the night shift at a local hospital - to say he'd done it because he had found some condoms on her and that was what he stuck by in court, but I have my own theories.' She describes the effect over the years as like a stone skimming across water - 'The ripples just carry on and on and on.' For one thing, April loved her father very much and looked up to him. 'I was a daddy's girl,' she says. 'And my sister looked after me a lot when my mum was at work. I lost them both at the same time, so it was hard, yes.' </p> <p>When she was 15, April met and fell in love with a much older man who took drugs and invited her to inject heroin with him. 'It took all my feelings away, just took it all away and I wanted it more and more, and I just carried on taking it from that day.' For six years thereafter April lived the toughest of lives, an existence that revolved around her addiction to drugs. She slept rough (in a skip for a while), robbed and shoplifted, lived with a series of pimps who beat her if she didn't earn enough money for them by selling her body for sex. ('One of them used to strip me when I got in to make sure I wasn't hiding money from him.') </p> <p>She has experienced unimaginable horror in her relatively short life and yet, with a lot of support from Sherrie primarily, she is miraculously showing every sign of coming out the other end. 'I was in prison when I found out I was pregnant,' she says. The discovery changed her life. 'I went on the methadone [a heroin substitute] and I was poorly for a few days, but it was worth it. I don't want to take drugs again because of how depressed they made me. I started on them because I was depressed, but they just made me more depressed.' When she got out of prison she found out that her midwife had been in touch with Sherrie, who she was then estranged from. 'She said mum wanted me to come home and live back here with her and that's all I needed to decide I wanted this baby and wanted to get clean for her.' </p> <p>When Carmella was born she was addicted to the methadone that her mother was taking, and had to withdraw in hospital over six days. 'She had a high-pitched scream, runny nose and eyes, tummy cramps,' April recalls. 'But when I got her home I was just so happy. I want to come off my methadone now and be a proper mother to her.' Obviously it is early days, but when you meet the three of them there is such a palpable atmosphere of care and support from Sherrie and determination from April that you come away feeling positive about the possibility of a happy ending. 'I fought for this,' says Sherrie. 'That girl walked through the door with nothing, five months pregnant and only the clothes she stood up in. But still we had to go to appeal before we got any financial support. I just kept saying everything is going to go down the pan if somebody doesn't help, because if I'm not here for April it will all fall apart.' </p> <p>In the end her saviour appeared in the form of a man called Craig from local support group, Hetty's. 'It took him fighting the social services for us. He's been brilliant. What strikes me though is that until things change you're going to need an awful lot of Craigs.'</p> <p>\u2022 Mum Loves Drugs, Not Me... is on Channel 4, November 3, at 8pm Pada can be contacted on 08457 023 867; New Era 01282 450 536 and Hetty's 08000 850 941</p>",
  "<p>The last time I was in a room with Leonardo DiCaprio was in 2001. It was his kitchen, and I was interviewing his then girlfriend, Brazilian gorgeousness Gisele B\u00fcndchen. Her Yorkshire terrier was yapping and she was talking non-stop in a dizzying way, with demanding eyes, lavish hair. She was warm, volatile and had a sense of entitlement. Leo was withdrawn, quiet and perhaps a little lost, chopping vegetables meticulously in the kitchen. He was making food to take over to a friend's house and he kept saying, 'Baby, we're late.' But Baby carried on talking and demanding empanadas. Gisele and the yorkie were going crazy for the tasty meaty morsels. Leo just kept chopping vegetables. Eventually, Gisele drove me home. Joni Mitchell's 'California' was playing, and we sang along. She told me Leo didn't do karaoke, but apart from that, life with him was great. But it didn't surprise me when they split up. It seemed as if they had nothing in common.</p> <p>Seven years on I'm in another room with DiCaprio, a slightly smoky suite at the Beverly Wilshire, where he's promoting Body of Lies, Ridley Scott's hard-hitting terrorists-versus-CIA movie. He's in a battered grey T-shirt and jeans, and though he's 6ft 1in he looks taller - perhaps because he's long limbed, perhaps because one expects movie stars to be Tom Cruise-sized. He's not as chunky as the look he adopted for Gangs of New York, where he gained 30lb, but he's still powerful looking. He appears both older and younger than his 33 years. His eyes are penetrating; he's polite and smiling, but guarded, in a subtle way - there's no hostility here. </p> <p>Body of Lies reunites DiCaprio with Russell Crowe. The last time they appeared together was in The Quick and the Dead, when DiCaprio was only 20. This was the pre-Titanic age, when he was known for sensitive, artsy portrayals - as a retarded boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and being beaten up by his cruel stepfather, Robert DeNiro, in This Boy's Life. 'And he [Russell] had just done Romper Stomper, so we were both very wet behind the ears,' says DiCaprio. 'We were handpicked as two people who had done interesting performances that year. It was our first encounter in a big-budget film. </p> <p>Russell was very cool to me back then, and supportive of me as a young actor. After all these years he's still the same guy. He's carved out a fantastic career for himself.'</p> <p>He describes Crowe as one of the most committed and powerful actors of his generation. Really, I say, I thought that was you. He rocks back in his chair and laughs. 'Well, you know, people don't say that sort of thing about themselves.' He may be giggling, but part of him knows it's the truth. DiCaprio has graduated into a heavyweight. A meticulous performance as the obsessive-compulsive Howard Hughes in Scorsese's The Aviator earned him a second Oscar nomination (the first came for Gilbert Grape), while his roles for the same director in Gangs of New York and The Departed brought gravitas and kudos. His third Oscar nomination was for Blood Diamond, which he considers a movie that changed things: people are now more aware of conflict diamonds, he says.</p> <p>So was the dynamic between you and Crowe the same, I ask. Did he still seem like a mentor? Could he be supportive in the same way? In the film, Crowe and DiCaprio are on the same side but at loggerheads with each other, and the tension is fascinating. </p> <p>'It was strange that it hadn't changed. It was just like walking into a room 15 years later, even though a lot of things have happened to both of us, and a lot of changes have gone on in the world. But we have both developed as actors, we both have more experience under our belts, and there was a different way in which we conversed in that period and now - in terms of arguing our characters' points back and forth. I don't think we did that back then,' he says. 'Not that we didn't take it seriously, but we never had the responsibility we do now. So yes, I noticed the difference in that regard, for sure. I knew he was going to be like that because you can see it up there in the screen in all the work he does. He is very committed.'</p> <p>He uses the word committed as if it were the highest accolade. The earlier DiCaprio was already thoughtful, hypersensitive even, but through taking risks in lower-budget movies such as The Beach and Blood Diamond, and making his own eco statement in The 11th Hour, he gets to earn the moniker 'very committed', too. Certainly in Body of Lies there is no room for a lightweight. It was a long, tough shoot, mostly in the desert, and involved several months in Morocco, standing in for Jordan. </p> <p>'I had a very hard shoot, very rough. I've done a lot of action sequences before, but this is a Ridley Scott movie. You are always moving locations at lightning speed. At any given second Ridley would come in and say, \"I want a helicopter to come in and shoot two missiles and I want that to be on camera and I want to have a surveillance camera 2,000ft in the air shooting on top of your head.\" At some points you really don't know what's going to happen. It's a huge adrenaline rush as an actor because you have to be prepared dramatically to have any given scene changed at any moment. It makes you trust your instincts more. It makes you delve deep into yourself. The better you know your character the better you know how he would react in any scenario, and Ridley will throw curveballs constantly. He is editing seven different cameras at the same time and then he'll say, \"I don't believe that. I don't care how much we've talked about this scene, it's not coming across, so I'm going to change everything.\" He's a very run-and-gun director. He likes to keep up the pace of a film unlike any director I've met. You'd better be prepared for anything. Someone like Scorsese, I suppose, is a lot more meticulous in the way he sets things up. He's very specific and takes a lot of time with each angle.'</p> <p>The pace of the film is unyielding; there's a scene at the end, when he's being tortured, where I could hardly breathe. 'Good,' he exclaims. 'I had a problem with that scene, so I'm glad it worked for you.'</p> <p>But it's so graphic, so real, I couldn't finish looking at it.</p> <p>'It was a pivotal point in the whole movie,' he says. 'It was make or break. If that scene didn't work the movie couldn't sustain itself. We needed to make it important, pertinent and controversial. I spoke to ex-heads of the CIA about what my character would be doing and how he would be handling himself. Because so much hinged on it I almost had a physical breakdown at the end of it. So a lot of what you see on the film is my breaking point. I physically collapsed for a few days after that. I got sick because of the intensity of it.'</p> <p>One of the themes of the movie is truth: who you trust and who you lie to. So, who would he lie to, and why? 'Intrinsically, an organisation like the CIA relies on secrecy. It is about covert operations, so we're doing a movie about modern-day CIA operations and practices. I think we got as close as we could get to how the US operates in this war on terror.'</p> <p>He makes no attempt to answer this question as a personal one. His answer is long and articulate, and difficult to interrupt. He seems to be saying that while you can't trust terrorists, you can't trust Americans either. </p> <p>'That is very symbolic of the truth. You have this character that is in a deceitful world, trying to catch the enemy that he could never trust. But it is a dirty, ugly war. He's trying to hold on to a semblance of morality and a belief in his country while his country is letting him down, and ironically he's starting to trust people who are - while not exactly the enemy - not the people he's beholden to. You have to start thinking out of the box. He starts to question his patriotism, what he stands for morally. This character is not somebody who is either good or bad. He is trying to hold on to a certain belief system that is lost.'</p> <p>And then you realise that DiCaprio probably is talking about himself. When you ask him about Bush or Palin he is unequivocal. His anti-Palin rants are legendary. He says simply, 'I hope that Barack Obama wins because I haven't been happy with the last eight years, and that has been reflected in the polls. It is no secret that the Bush administration and the way they handled not only the war on terror but everything else has only a 10 per cent approval rating. So yes, I can only hope for Barack Obama; for a brilliant mind to come in and change everything. It is a scary world that the United States has ventured into. And Barack Obama can set this country on a different course.'</p> <p>Leonardo DiCaprio straddles two diametrically opposed worlds: the greed and instant gratification of Hollywood and impassioned environmentalism. He drives what he calls a golf-cart car, a Prius, and he made The 11th Hour, a detailed documentary about our planet in crisis. He is alarmed about 'human beings regarding this planet as a service station'. </p> <p>And yet the message comes with a smile. He once picked up a journalist's tape recorder after they'd both ordered lunch and the writer went to make a call. He told the machine that the writer shouldn't be eating hamburgers, even though DiCaprio himself had ordered one, because cows release methane gas; but you can't have tuna either, he said, because the nets capture innocent little dolphins. He was being jokey but serious at the same time. He doesn't mean to preach. Besides, he has been a Hollywood bad boy - one who liked to throw horse shit at Italian paparazzi and hang out in bars with gaggles of models wearing tiny outfits.</p> <p>But the contradictions work to make him human. That's why he relished the idea of playing a more complex character in Body of Lies, one that was neither a hero nor a villain. He laughs: 'Of course it was so much easier to play someone caught in a moral web, who tries to manipulate people as best he can, but who knows he is also being manipulated. He goes on a personal journey where he realises that he is not part of any specific nationality any more. It's not about nationality; it's about what's right or wrong for him.</p> <p>'When you are given an opportunity to make a film like Body of Lies, and I would put Blood Diamond in the same category, of course you jump at these opportunities. Blood Diamond shed a different light on that trade.'</p> <p>I would like to think, as DiCaprio believes, that Body of Lies will shed a different light on the war on terror, but it opened in the US in a week dominated by the recent Wall Street crash and had to settle for third place in the movie charts behind Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Still, DiCaprio argues gamely, 'Historically we are going to look back at this type of movie and it will make people really think about what was going on at the time.' </p> <p>One imagines that DiCaprio will have greater success with Sam Mendes's Revolutionary Road, which reunites him with Kate Winslet. A haunting, gnawing movie based on the novel by Richard Yates, it's set in the mid-Fifties, post-Second World War but pre-Mad Men. Winslet and DiCaprio's relationship is sour and spiralling. They play a young married couple, Frank and April Wheeler, who are stuck in suburbia, trapped by the social confines of their lives and of their time. Frank has lost his nerve and lost his way. April is a trapped housewife, a homemaker who wants to go to Paris and be bohemian, but finds herself pregnant with a third baby. </p> <p>The story resonates with DiCaprio because, as he asks, 'What is the American dream supposed to be? And how similar are we now to that era, in a lot of ways? It's about two people going crazy in that kind of environment. Being stripped of their identity and feeling they are living a life of clich\u00e9s. What drew me towards it was that it's very reflective of the United States's moral position in the Fifties and this is where we still hinge ourselves morally, how we view our family, our fundamentals. And also, I'm a huge fan of Kate and Sam.'</p> <p>But he seems uneasy that working with Kate again conjures up Titanic. DiCaprio was already one of the most famous and perhaps one of the most beautiful men in the world before Titanic. He could have had anything he wanted. But after Titanic he couldn't go out without a million girls chasing him, screaming, and he hated it. He turned down everything big-box-office after Titanic: said no to Anakin Skywalker, American Psycho and Spiderman, which turned his best friend Tobey Maguire into a star. He feared it: 'It was never my intention to have my image shown around the world.' Or to see barbers in Afghanistan arrested as they enraged the Taliban by offering a Leo DiCaprio-style haircut labelled 'The Titanic'. Then there was the time at an airport in Paris when a teenager grabbed his leg and pressed her head into it, clutching desperately. He tried to tell her that if she would get off his leg he would talk to her, but she wouldn't leave. The incident marked him. He wanted to be an actor, not a celebrity. He didn't do any movies at all for a couple of years because he was said to be suffering from 'post-Titanic distress syndrome' - the kind of fame where everyone wants to talk to you but nobody wants to listen to what you've got to say. </p> <p>'The movies that I'm doing now are the movies that I've always wanted to do,' he says. 'If I'd had these opportunities when I was younger I'd have done them in a heartbeat. But you don't always get the chance to make films that you have a kinship to when you're starting. I took some time off after Titanic because I needed to let the dust settle, and recharge my battery. I felt, \"OK, you've been given a tremendous opportunity, what are you going to do with it? Now your name can finance movies that you do want to do.\" That wasn't something that I wanted to squander. I wanted to wait until </p> <p>I felt I could really contribute something that had the kind of edge I'd always been looking for since I started.' </p> <p>Although these films might have had edge without box office, the combined effect was to make Leo an almost impossible combination, an edgy Hollywood star. His character in Revolutionary Road might be his best bet yet for an Oscar. He seems to light up when he talks about his darkness. 'It's a film about the disintegration of a relationship. We're putting a smile on our face and doing all the things you should be doing in a loving relationship, but the darker side is taking over. It's people who are holding on to their love in circumstances that are ripping them apart. I'm more attracted to doing that sort of thing these days because things in this world... they aren't easy, they're very complicated.'</p> <p>You wonder if his relationship with Bar Refaeli, the Israeli supermodel, is uncomplicated. He is a Scorpio with Libra rising. 'That means I'm trying to balance the passionate, dark, insane parts of Scorpio the best I can, and I think I'm doing a pretty good job.'</p> <p>DiCaprio started off strangely shy around women. He says, 'I've always been a slow starter. My first date was with a girl called Cessi. We had a beautiful relationship over the phone all summer and then when we met I couldn't look her in the eye.' He doesn't seem to look many people in the eye directly for long, but that hasn't stopped him romancing Kate Moss, Helena Christensen, Eva Herzigova and Amber Valletta. </p> <p>He says that he would love to have a wife he feels comfortable with. He says he wants a kid 'some day'. We have to skirt borders very carefully when talking about intimate things, not least because he doesn't want to be defined by his relationships with supermodels. For a long time he would take his mum to premieres instead of an inamorata. He has never liked to talk about his girlfriends, be pictured with them, or give tantalising details away, because that would feed the paparazzi, who have made him miserable. Instead, he's one of those actors who feels that 'defining yourself to the public on a consistent basis is death to a performer. The more you define who you are personally the less you are able to submerge into the characters you do, and people will think, \"I don't buy him in that role.\"'</p> <p>So the image we have of him is amorphous, a bad-boy superhero, soulful but likes to party, committed to his work but not necessarily to his long-term girlfriends. He once said his ideal wife would be one who was independent, who wouldn't mind if he went off to Alaska at a moment's notice with his friends. Robert De Niro is his friend. Not the kind of hanging-out-with friend, but the kind of friend who would recommended him to Martin Scorsese. 'I was humbled by that. De Niro-Scorsese is my generation's choice of greatest actor-director dynamic. It is to the previous one's Brando-Kazan.' He is about to start a fourth film with Scorsese, Shutter Island. They are muse and mentor. 'I have so much respect for him. Who doesn't, you know?' </p> <p>Scorsese had to wait years for his Oscar. Does DiCaprio mind missing out three times? 'I have a theory. We all have our personal choices of who we think should win, but there are certain times you look back at the movie that won that year and you think, \"How was that humanly possible?\"'</p> <p>Sometimes people get the Oscar for the wrong movie, I suggest. 'Yes, but I am not feverishly hunting one down. I am trying to do the best work I possibly can and making movies that will have resonance for years to come. I think if you try for an Oscar or a goal like that, the more people are going to see it as transparent. It's not on my radar. If it happens, great, but I'm happy to continue working as I am, really.'</p> <p>He is happy being an active person. 'Life's too short to be lazy and passive, and I don't like to stay in one environment for too long, or get set in one way of thinking. I love to travel, get involved in different environmental projects. Stimulate myself.'</p> <p>It's been written that you like to be on your own a lot. 'No. I think I'm more of a people person.' Is it true that you have the same set of about 10 really good friends that you grew up with because you don't need new friends and never lose old ones? 'Mmm,' he considers. 'I suppose, yes. I do have about 10 really good friends. But the fact I don't have new ones is not true.'</p> <p>It is true that you don't necessarily know who to trust, he says, returning to the theme. 'People who are celebrities are shrouded in mystery. Jack Nicholson said, \"By the very nature of being known you meet more people in an average week.\" It makes you hold on to the people you know and trust. But at the same time I try to keep an open mind, because there are a lot of fascinating people out there. Being an environmentalist and also doing this business opens me up to entirely different worlds, and I love to juggle those things.'</p> <p>So it seems there are two contradicting Leos: shy, untrusting, circumspect Leo, and gregarious, up-for-anything Leo. He's been careful to display both, so I'll never pin him down as one or the other. He's answered everything, but not very exactly. He's played a perfect game. He keeps you smiling and he's laughing, even. He doesn't let you get too close, but he doesn't let you notice the distance.</p> <p>\u2022 Body of Lies opens on 21 November</p>",
  "<p>How peculiar that the name we have given to one of cinema's most intangible appeals for our approval is 'chemistry', when there is nothing in the least bit scientific about it. Sure, every now and then someone will claim to have nailed the essence of what makes a memorable or compelling screen couple. In 2004, for example, scientists at London's King's College announced they had arrived at a formula for engineering romantic chemistry between two movie stars. They gave the relationship between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation nine points out of a possible 10 for its 'subtlety', and declared that the moment in When Harry Met Sally... in which Billy Crystal confesses his love for Meg Ryan resulted in that esoteric scientific sensation known as 'a slight butterfly in [the] tummy'. In other words, they didn't have the foggiest idea how screen chemistry comes about either. </p> <p>But the success and failure of a movie can rest on this amorphous connection between two performers. A screen romance can be engineered by camera placement, manipulated in the editing suite and bolstered by an emphatic composer, but if there's nothing between the supposed lovers other than a yearning to hear the word 'Cut' and get back to the craft service table, it is comforting to think that we will be able to tell from our vantage point in the stalls. The next few months will see studios and distributors going into overdrive as they launch the movies on which they are pinning their Oscar hopes, and a good deal of these will stand or fall on whether or not audiences warm to the partnerships at the centre of them. So much of our response to a film is dictated by whether we believe in it or not, and the most fundamental element of that belief is our relationship with the actors, and their relationship with each other.</p> <p>Thanks to Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio will be joined for ever. But that could count for nought in the context of the upcoming Revolutionary Road, in which they play a bickering couple whose marriage is unravelling - not at all the same thing as being carefree lovers jigging in the third-class cabin and having clammy sex in a steamed-up jalopy. Then there is Australia, in which Nicole Kidman was originally paired with her close friend Russell Crowe until he queried the number of zeroes on his cheque and was replaced by the more even-tempered and considerably less picky Hugh Jackman. And while Gus van Sant's Oscar-tipped Milk concentrates on the political life of openly gay Seventies politician Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, it'll be interesting to see whether Penn and his on-screen lover James Franco will make a plausible couple, irrespective of their much-discussed but as-yet-unseen lip-locking.</p> <p>It's not just romantic partnerships that must ignite our interest. Frost/Nixon depends for its kick on the frisson between Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as his quarry, Richard Nixon; the screenplay is suffused with boxing metaphors, but the film will be on the ropes if viewers don't consider the leads to be evenly matched. The Soloist stars Robert Downey Jr as a journalist who bonds with a homeless musician, played by Jamie Foxx, but Universal, which is releasing the film, will be hoping for a harmonious duet between these two credible awards contenders. Recent thriller Righteous Kill teamed Robert De Niro with Al Pacino for only the second time (excluding The Godfather Part II, in which they occupied separate plot-lines) but overplayed the tantalising rapport that the actors had generated in just a few scenes of Heat. 'Leave 'em wanting more' and 'Quit while you're ahead' were just two of the thoughts that came to mind as Righteous Kill killed our desire to see another De Niro/Pacino pas de deux in this lifetime.</p> <p>Like the most durable relationships in life, the on-screen couple can benefit from enjoying their own space, as those actors did for the majority of Heat. The word 'daring' may have no business being mentioned in the same paragraph as Sleepless in Seattle, but even the stoniest viewer would have to concede that there was something playfully adventurous in the determination to keep the film's stars, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, apart until the final moments. Sometimes it pays off, as it did here and in daffy 1959 comedy Pillow Talk, where Doris Day and Rock Hudson played many of their scenes on the phone. Sometimes not - one of the common complaints about Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain was that the bond between its stars, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, was too slender to give their protracted on-screen estrangement any weight, or their reunion much sense of triumph.</p> <p>At their most fruitful, on-screen couples can lend a sense of conspiratorial intimacy and continuity to audiences' cinema-going habits. Most commercial film-making is geared toward giving consumers what they already know they want, with the odd tweak here and there for the sake of freshness; an ongoing partnership advertises in advance the pleasures on offer. From Myrna Loy and William Powell in the series of detective films that began with The Thin Man in 1934, to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in the Road to... comedies, the successful partnership has been as reassuringly defined as any genre. The pairing of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, for example, over the course of nine films - Adam's Rib (1949) and Pat and Mike (1952) being the niftiest - provided viewers with a chance to witness an ongoing and often thrillingly sparky courtship in which zingers were thwacked back and forth in the manner of a Wimbledon rally. </p> <p>Film and reality isn't always strictly demarcated, and a real-life couple like Hepburn and Tracy must have brought before the camera some of the crackle of their off-screen relationship, just as Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall did in their films together, most notably the electrifying To Have and Have Not, on which they first met in 1944. ('Somewhere there must have been a spark,' Bacall said in 2007, 'because we were fooling and joking and that always leads to trouble.') And when ex-lovers Woody Allen and Diane Keaton traded wisecracks again after a long hiatus in 1993's Manhattan Murder Mystery, their rumpled comic joyfulness was as evident, and as exciting, as it had been in Seventies work such as Sleeper and Annie Hall</p> <p>Even genuine intimacy doesn't necessarily translate to the screen, as demonstrated by Madonna's inability to generate sparks with any of her male co-stars, even those with whom she happened to be sharing a bed at the time (Sean Penn in Shanghai Surprise, Warren Beatty in Dick Tracy). It seems almost taboo to mention Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in Gigli, like saying the word 'Macbeth' in a theatre dressing room, but it remains vital that we learn lessons from that experience, now that our laughter at the film has abated. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise struck some intriguingly discordant notes in Eyes Wide Shut, but it wasn't their fault that their strong work was underappreciated; audiences titillated by the suggestion of biology as well as chemistry in that film's trailer reacted badly to what they perceived as a broken promise.</p> <p>Which couple now provides that same depth and breadth? It is so unusual in modern cinema for a couple to be paired across more than one film that when it does occur, it feels like a PR stunt or a freaky coincidence. Hanks and Ryan teamed up again in You've Got Mail, but there seemed nothing much left for them to build on, and Hanks arguably found a more charismatic sparring partner when he shared the screen with a volleyball named Wilson in Cast Away. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts were one of the most adored screen couples of the early Nineties, fully charming enough to make audiences forget that (a) their hit film together, Pretty Woman, implicitly advocated prostitution as a way of snagging Mr Right and that (b) until this point, Gere had seemed unable to express convincingly amorous feelings toward anyone but himself. But how deflated they both seemed in their reunion, 10 years later, in Runaway Bride. The same experiment failed a second time recently for Gere, as the millions of people who cherished his screen work with Diane Lane in Unfaithful failed conspicuously to display any fidelity toward their rematch in Nights in Rodanthe</p> <p>There are director-star teams who attract audiences in the way acting duos once did - think of Scorsese and De Niro, or Scorsese and DiCaprio - while comic chemistry has been strongly represented by the Frat Pack and its various spin-offs. But where is the sizzling romantic partnership that draws on the same magic as Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in The Way We Were, or Streisand and Ryan O'Neal in What's Up, Doc?, let alone Tracy/Hepburn or Bogart/Bacall? I propose there is only one in recent cinema to even come close: Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in Richard Linklater's brace of eloquent, freewheeling love stories, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset</p> <p>In those films, this delightful couple strolls first through Vienna, then Paris, shooting the breeze about whatever occurs to them. It is the aura of weightlessness in their interaction, as well as its warmth and inclusivity, that epitomises what any truly great screen couple should aspire to. Screen chemistry is predicated on two elements. First, the audience must believe wholeheartedly that the relationship on screen is organic, and not just something cooked up in the offices of CAA, or spliced together by a wily editor. Second, we should feel that we are being magically incorporated into that relationship, not as gooseberries or voyeurs, but as sympathetic advocates.</p> <p>The reason audiences reacted so badly to, say, Lopez and Affleck was arguably because their whole partnership had the ring of some sneering, postmodern in-joke on the absurdities of celebrity; we were outside, looking in, like spectators along the route of a garish parade. Conversely, Delpy and Hawke, like all the most magnetic screen couples, make us feel exactly the way we want to feel in the real-life relationships we engender - in a word, wanted.</p> <h2>Five electric scenes that lit up the screen</h2> <p><strong>Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944)</strong></p> <p>Bogart was 44 years old, Bacall 19. In their spiciest scene together, she practically had him - and us - dangling on the end of a string like a yo-yo. 'You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and ... blow.' They married the following year. Well, wouldn't you?</p> <p><strong>Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in Pat and Mike (1952)</strong></p> <p>'An upper-cruster like you and my kinda type that can't even speak left-handed English,' observes Tracy, as the sports promoter who takes a shine, professionally and personally, to the athletic Hepburn. 'The whole gizmo is hard to believe.' But audiences gladly did so, falling hook, line and sinker for Hepburn/Tracy over nine films. </p> <p><strong>Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie Hall (1977)</strong></p> <p>'Love is too weak a word for what I feel - I luuurve you, you know, I loave you, I luff you, two Fs.' This autobiographical comedy (Allen and Keaton were ex-lovers) brims with bittersweet moments, such as the lobster-boiling scene, improvised for the camera, in which Allen cracks up uncontrollably.</p> <p><strong>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic (1997)</strong></p> <p>Kate and Leo clicked in a major way, no more so than in the famous 'sketch' scene in which she turns the tables on him, insisting that he draw her with a diamond necklace on, and nothing else.</p> <p><strong>Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in Before Sunset (2004)</strong></p> <p>Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) meet in Paris nine years after their one night together in Vienna. Now he has to fly home to his family. 'Baby, you are gonna miss that plane,' she purrs. 'I know,' he replies. Fade out. The end.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Matt Stinson, 30, is a psychotherapist. He lives in north London and has a partner.</strong></p> <p>I was bored one hot summer afternoon and went on Gaydar. Patrick's messages were witty and caught my interest. I ended up driving over to pick him up. Really dodgy, I know. We spent the next two days together.</p> <p>I'd always thought I was attracted to the tall, dark and handsome brooding type and Patrick was short, pale and a bit cheeky. The fact he was so different from me was definitely part of the attraction. He would talk about some random celebrity he'd interviewed and I would tell him about some young pregnant refugee who was about to be deported. </p> <p>After six months together, both our flatmates were moving out and it just made sense for me to move in with him. It was too quick really. That's when our differences really came to a head. I'm a bit of a clean freak and let's just say he's not. I did a test on him and put a cotton bud behind the toilet to see how long it would take for him to find it. After about two weeks I couldn't stand it any more and had to throw it away. He never even knew it was there. </p> <p>Patrick was very extroverted and had a big social network. It was great for me. Being American I'd only known my friends here for a short time, and we would spend Christmases together with his family, which I loved. His little niece would call me Uncle Matt. It was so different from my own family. Once we visited my mother in New Jersey and she wouldn't let us stay in her house. She's always been fine about me being gay in theory but not in practice. I think the idea of her gay son and his boyfriend was too much.</p> <p>I was training to be a psychotherapist at the time and you have to do your own therapy. One of the things I learnt was that I have a tendency to try to please people and make them happy at my own expense. Patrick loves being looked after and I like looking after people, so we were a great match. But ultimately that was part of the downfall. I ended up resenting it. I felt like I was carrying two people on my back.</p> <p>We'd been together almost four years when I decided to go home to America for three weeks alone. Patrick was really upset. I think he felt I was abandoning him. It was a really soul-searching trip for me. I saw my family and met up with my first boyfriend in Washington. Patrick would phone me up at inopportune times and want to talk and we would end up arguing. When I came back I was dreading seeing him. That's when he knew it was over. We split up about a week later.</p> <p>Patrick does have a tendency towards hypochondria - he'll have a cold and convince himself it's pneumonia - so when he started calling me months later saying he felt terrible I thought it was just him being ridiculous. Some people said he was just depressed because we'd broken up and he was trying to manipulate me. Then we discovered it was a tumour and it was very serious. It was hard because the whole reason we'd broken up was for me to find my own life and not look after him and that's exactly what I was doing. But this time it was a conscious choice whereas before I felt I was doing it on autopilot. </p> <p>People were very judgmental when I told them we were moving back together. I've lost a few friends. It's so different from when we lived together before because we have our own lives and are our own people. When we were a couple I felt there was so much pressure on me to make him happy all the time and now I'm just responsible for my own happiness. I've been seeing someone for about four months. When I eventually told him I live with my ex, he was actually fine with it. I don't think Patrick's jealous. I'm not sure how I would feel if it were the other way round though.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Strudwick, 31, is a dating columnist and journalist. He lives in north London and is single.</strong></p> <p>When I first saw Matt's picture online he was doing this ridiculous over-the-top pout into the camera. I thought he seemed like a bit of a laugh and quite possibly a superficial idiot. Either way he was hot. He told me later he thought I looked happy and uncomplicated in my profile. How wrong we both were.</p> <p>He was the one who pursued me. He can be very persistent when he wants something. I was reeling from a destructive relationship that had broken up so I was quite blas\u00e9 about it. I found him really calming to be with. It was a slow-burning kind of love. It took a few months before the L word was used. No one had ever listened to me in the way that he did and actually remembered what I said. Like I would casually mention I liked a certain brand of chocolate and the next time I saw him he would drop an armful on my lap. It was impressive to the point it was almost too much. </p> <p>He comes from a working-class New Jersey background and I'm from a liberal middle-class Home Counties background, but we had a similar take on the world. He's also very sarcastic which is rare for an American.</p> <p>I'd never lived with a boyfriend before. We would cook for each other and curl up on the sofa. In my early twenties I was a big party animal and Matt was the perfect antidote to that. I'd become cut off emotionally and he really softened me. He's such a giving person. I'd never felt so safe. My family absolutely adored him. He became like another son to them. It's a hard task being as good a person as Matt and I never managed it.</p> <p>Apart from the fact I am apparently the untidiest person in the world, one of the major issues was his constant need to look after me and of course I loved it. When he went to America on holiday I remember being really upset because somehow I knew I really was saying goodbye. When he got back it was obvious something had shifted. He became very withdrawn. We talked for hours, both crying, but I never fought to keep him. I knew it was the right thing for him to be on this own.</p> <p>I didn't realise how devastated I was until he moved out. I threw myself into buying my first house, just to distract myself really. After a few months I started to get ill. I had no idea what it was at first. I remember calling him when I was really sick and passing out on the phone. He called the ambulance and came with me to hospital. I was diagnosed with an intestinal tumour. I couldn't have got through the next few months without him. He did everything for me, bringing me food, staying up all night with me in hospital and keeping me calm. </p> <p>There were a lot of raised eyebrows when he moved back in with me but I didn't care. I'd had a series of disastrous lodgers and I needed someone I could rely on. And he's my favourite person in the whole world. In many ways we're happier now than when we were 'together' together.</p> <p>It felt like we were partners in crime, both talking over our horrific experiences dating other people and having a laugh about it. It's strange now seeing him with someone else - particularly as it's getting serious. His new boyfriend is really nice and everything I couldn't give him.</p> <p>I've started writing a relationship column, which has became strangely therapeutic. Dating can be quite a lonely experience, particularly when it doesn't go well, and it helps to turn it into something funny. I made Matt promise not to read it. He doesn't need to know the full graphic details I go into - if I knew he would read it I couldn't write it. In the same way if I was having sex I wouldn't ask him to come and watch. It's too close to the bone.</p>",
  "<p>For sale: four-bedroom detached bungalow, some work needed, cost: $800. The catch? It's in Detroit, home to the once mighty Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, and not many people want to live in the Motor City now that the American car giants are laying off tens of thousands of workers. </p> <p>The bungalow is not the only bargain basement property up for grabs: thousands of others are on the market for $10,000 or less. One estate agent who has sold 50 properties - mostly foreclosures - in Detroit is trying to remain upbeat but admits: 'It is a blue-collar town like a lot of other American towns, but it has been hit harder than most.' He says there are houses are going for $5,000 while homeowners next door are struggling to pay a $60,000 to $70,000 mortgage on an identical property. 'It's obviously devastating for them.'</p> <p>The Detroit property market and the US car industry are mirror images: both are in freefall. Speculation is mounting that the government is planning a bail-out of the giant 'Detroit Three'. On Thursday, Presidential candidate Barack Obama added to the clamour, calling for a doubling of the $25bn in government loans recently approved by Congress to help the industry make more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>Washington is also said to be trying to engineer a merger of GM and Chrysler as analysts predict that the latter's new owner, private equity firm Cerberus, could pull the plug on it. Without dramatic government intervention, analysts predict all three companies will run out of money some time next year. </p> <p>This side of the Atlantic, the mood of car manufacturers is less grim. But not by much, as they fear they could be next in line: car makers are slashing production across the board to cut costs as sales slump. In the UK, Japanese firm Honda last week said it would cut output by a tenth - 32,000 vehicles, rather than 22,000 as previously planned. All the other five major carmakers in the UK - Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar/Land Rover, Ford and GM - have made similar moves, putting workers on four-day weeks and getting rid of overtime and agency shift workers. No one knows how many 'temporary' production cuts will be made permanent, or when - as will surely happen - jobs are shed along with output. </p> <p>The clamour in Europe for some kind of bail-out is also growing as car makers ask why the banks should get all the help. On Wednesday, the European Commission said that up to \u20ac40bn (\u00a331bn) of 'soft loans' could be provided to the industry by the European Investment Bank. Ostensibly, like the US plan to provide $25bn, this would help companies retool their factories to meet tough EU legislation being proposed to cut carbon emissions from new cars. But if the industry wasn't in crisis, it is unlikely this money would be on the table and, if approved, it would be a bail-out in all but name.</p> <p>It's hard to exaggerate the scale of the crisis facing the Detroit Three; in many ways, they are in a more parlous state than the banks. In 2000, the high-water mark for the industry, the combined stock market value of Ford and GM was more than $130bn. Today, you could pick up both for $10bn and still have change. Citigroup analysts estimate that the pair are carrying $69bn of debt between them. Since 2005, the companies have been haemorrhaging money: in the first half of this year they lost almost $30bn. Paul Newton, analyst from consultancy Global Insight, says: 'The big three are in severe trouble. The past couple of years have been a bloodbath.'</p> <p>And how did they get themselves into this mess? More than any other incumbent car makers, they've been outwitted by nimbler, more efficient - and cheaper - foreign rivals. Twenty years ago, more than two-thirds of cars made in the US were manufactured by GM, Ford and Chrysler. This year, according to the Centre for Automotive Research, for the first time foreign car makers, led by Toyota, will overtake them. </p> <p>The trio have also been hamstrung by the ruinous cost - estimated at $100bn - of providing healthcare for two million current and former workers. Last year, a landmark agreement with the UAW union capped these liabilities, but the damage had already been done. </p> <p>That was not all. Soaring fuel prices have soured Americans' love affair with big, powerful 'sports utility vehicles' and boosted sales of smaller cars - more typically made by the big three's rivals. When the credit crunch took hold a year ago and property sales plummeted because of the shortage of credit, car loans also began to dry up. In response, the three companies have announced plans to close 35 plants, mostly in the area around Detroit, with the total loss of 100,000 jobs. GM and Ford are looking to expand operations in lower-cost places, such as Mexico, China and Africa. </p> <p>But this restructuring, huge as it is, already looks hopelessly inadequate to stem their ballooning losses. With recession looming, credit, for the few people contemplating buying a new car in these straitened times, is even harder to come by. The financing arm of GM recently announced lending restrictions which, dealers estimate, would prevent almost two-thirds of would-be GM buyers from finding a loan, and Chrysler has made similar moves. Toyota plans to take advantage, according to Citigroup analysts, by offering interest-free loans on 11 models, which will only hasten the decline of the Detroit Three. </p> <p>Citigroup predicts a 35 per cent sales slump overall in October compared with last year, with GM and Chrysler even worse hit as they withdraw credit. US car sales will pick up - most analysts predict a recovery in 2010 - but to what extent the big three will benefit is unclear. PWC estimated in September that they planned to cut production by about one million vehicles by 2012, but this may not be enough. </p> <p>Newton says: 'The question is whether the big three can cut jobs and close factories, particularly in the US, quickly enough to offset their losses. Their current restructuring plan is based on last year's industry forecasts. However, the outlook is far worse now. It's touch and go.' </p> <p>He also doubts whether the rumoured merger of GM and Chrysler would do more than delay the inevitability of further plant closures and job losses by a couple of months. </p> <p>Summing up the apprehensive mood among car makers in Europe, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan, said recently: 'We don't know if we're at the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning.' </p> <p>European car makers no longer look on at the plight of the big three with the sense of detachment they had a year ago: the question now being asked in boardrooms across the continent is: 'Could it happen to us?'</p> <p>The situation is certainly tough in the UK, but the news isn't all bad. We never had a 'big three' anyway and the last 'national champion' - Rover - collapsed some time ago. Last week, Ford announced plans to invest \u00a370m in its Bridgend engine assembly plant and BMW is building a new electric Mini at Oxford. Even if EU legislation on carbon emissions is watered down or delayed, as the industry wants, the trend towards more fuel-efficient cars will benefit the UK's Japanese car makers, who tend to make smaller, more efficient vehicles.</p> <p>But the last remaining Ford and GM plants in the UK are more vulnerable. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of Ford's Southampton Transit van plant and GM's plants at Luton and Liverpool. Both companies have a lot of capacity all over Europe and may want to retrench to their German bases. How the UK's Jaguar/Land-Rover, bought by Indian conglomerate Tata last year from Ford, can also halve its gas guzzlers' emissions is not clear. </p> <p>In mainland Europe, particularly France, Germany and Italy, car makers can count on government intervention to help them ride out the storm. British car makers aren't so lucky. PWC estimates UK annual production will fall by around 12 per cent to 1.5 million vehicles by 2012. This is a larger fall than predicted for the UK's European counterparts - France (8.6 per cent) and Germany (where a 3.7 per increase is forecast).</p> <p>The crisis gripping the big three and the alarm growing among Europe's car makers will, in effect, only hasten the inevitable: the shift of production to countries where costs are lower, primarily India, China, Russia and Thailand. </p> <p>Who will emerge from the biggest shake-out in the industry's 100-year history to lead the march into the new markets is not clear. But don't bet your house - even if it's in Detroit - on any one of the big three taking the honour.</p>",
  "<h2>Tobias Wolff</h2> <p><strong>Celebrated novelist and memoirist. His latest short story collection, Our Story Begins, was published in August. Won the 1985 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for The Barracks Thief (1984)</strong></p> <p>Last week I was roused from sleep by a strange dream - that my bearded, hairy-backed, happily married older brother Geoffrey, now 70 and up to his eyeballs in grandchildren, had decided to get a sex change. My mentioning this to anyone who knows him has unfailingly produced peals of laughter. All right - dreams are funny, when they're funny. But imagine waking every day to the dream that George W Bush is your president.</p> <p>I simply can't, as Justice Scalia has advised, 'get over it'. As I grind my coffee to the morning newscast and the image of our confident president appears, the bile rises in the gorge, boiling over into tantrums and rants and declarations of despair that, even in the moment, strike me as clownish and pitiable, and are certainly viewed by my family in that light, until they join in.</p> <p>No, I can't get over it, and neither can my friends, hard as we all try. When we meet for dinner we do our best to take up other subjects - books, gossip, movies, our children - but then, like the addicts we've become, we sneak back to the drug of outrage, shooting up the latest barefaced lie and squalid revelation, not forgetting to list yet again the national and global catastrophes brought about by the incompetence, hypocrisy, muddleheadedness, venality, truculence, mendacity, callousness, zealotry, machismo, lawlessness, cynicism, wishful thinking, and occasional downright evil of the administration of George W Bush. Our economy is in freefall, our public school system a disgrace, our military exhausted, the wounded and traumatised dying of neglect, yea, the very earth groaning for relief - and he's optimistic! Yessiree! Looking forward to it! Leaning toward us over the podium with that exasperated little squint and that impatient, dentist-drill voice, utterly at a loss as to how he got saddled with a nation of such gloomy Guses and crybabies.</p> <p>Eddying around our own indignation again and again, as if caught in some Bermuda Triangle of complaint, we are unable not to remind each other of the fatal character of George Bush's incomprehension, the thousands upon thousands who have died by his blithe actions and inactions, and his inability to understand at any level - political, moral, emotional - the terrible damage he has done, this man whose idea of sharing in the grief of parents who've lost a son or daughter in Iraq is to give up playing golf! If he really did.</p> <p>There - I've stepped in the trap again. I can't help it. And for many of us that has been a defining condition of life in George W Bush's reign, this unanswerable need to register anew and aloud our shock and dismay, indeed our disbelief, at finding him at the wheel as we wake each morning. </p> <p>Was it ever so? Nixon, especially in his last months, inspired fits of revulsion, but never incredulity that he had achieved the office in the first place. Same with Johnson. They were at least very smart, and deeply experienced. </p> <p>So how did George W Bush do it? On the face of it, such a man getting himself elected President of the United States would seem an impossibility - this party boy, this tangle-tongued, failed businessman who always managed to save his own bacon while his investors went under, this tough-talking supporter of the Vietnam war who hid out in the Texas Air National Guard when his turn came to serve. Karl Rove's strategic exploitation of social divisions and resentments deserves some of the credit. The Supreme Court, to be sure - Bush vs Gore. Chicanery at the polls and a lot of dumb luck, most notably in the form of 3,000 old folks flummoxed by a confusing ballot. All this and more. But there had to be something else, a meta-narrative if you will, that established him in the hearts of the large minority who voted for him in 2000 and the decisive majority who returned him to power in 2004. And what else could that have been, but what it always is with such empty shirts? Nostalgia. </p> <p>In short, he presented himself as a man of the past - that star-spangled past when it only took one ranger to quell a riot, and you drove big cars without getting sneered at by sissies on bicycles, and you could make a few million without having to divvy it up with the lazy pathetnoids next door; when neighbours talked over the fence and could depend on each other, and the rivers ran straight and clear and teeming with trout, and you could dredge them for gold without the government breathing down your neck, and the trees were really big and you could chop them down, and you won wars, and men wore hats to work and meant what they said, and nobody was gay, and the queers all lived in New York, and you could say under God and have a Christmas tree on the town green without people in turbans and sidelocks getting up your nose about it.</p> <p>That was the America we think we grew up in, and we want it back, and George W Bush, with his down-home voice, and gunslinger swagger, and no-nonsense contempt for the complications of a modern society, gave clear promise of a right of return to that good and simple past. That was his appeal, in both senses of the word. And in this one thing, alas, he was sincere.</p> <p>He wants the fictional past to become the actual present. </p> <p>This might be risible if he weren't President. But he is, and it isn't, because he has resolutely declined to prepare for any future he doesn't approve of, say the one where his war perversely ignores the script, and 4,000 young Americans get killed, and 40,000 more come home with wounds to their bodies, and still more thousands return with wounds to their minds and souls that may never heal, and find themselves, for lack of any foresight at all, in understaffed, rat-infested hospitals and psych wards, while the people we claimed to be saving are killed and crippled in even greater numbers - numbers unknown, because it has been our stated policy not to count them. George W Bush wouldn't countenance that future. Or the future where we start running out of oil. Or the future where glaciers disappear and McMurdo Bay starts looking like a good bet for a Club Med. Or the future where our economy begins to melt into foreign hands. Or the future where foreign hands begin to refuse our economy. </p> <p>We have been in dire need of someone who could adapt to, even, within reason, anticipate manifestly changing conditions in this country and the world at large. But we have had George W Bush, who views change as illicit, even as betrayal, and will not compound the betrayal by any change in himself. And under his unmoving hand you can feel the country straining to move forward, like some great engine shrieking toward the breaking point as the driver presses the pedal to the floor but refuses to shift from neutral into gear.</p> <p>Of course he could not have staged this astonishing performance without support. I'm not speaking of Rove, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Feith, Perle, Gonzales, Ashcroft, Bremer, Tenet, 'Scooter' (!) Libby, David Addington and John Yoo and the rest of that scabrous crowd of armchair warriors, perjurers, torturers, and fools. No, they didn't put him in office; the American people did. 'My fellow Americans' - to use the term by which every lying speech is prefaced. And the fact of his election, as much as the incessant abrasion of George W Bush's misgovernment, oppresses me with embarrassment and, I confess, a certain despair for our future.</p> <p>Yes, embarrassment - because his electors really are, after all, my fellow Americans, and I have always wanted to believe in their basic good sense, as I want them to believe in mine. That trust is in fact the very ground of a democratic society. Yet enough of my fellow Americans played the sucker to give this man two terms as President. Amazing! In truth, you never saw such a transparently smug, happily ignorant, unread, unthinking candidate for high office, let alone this office. Surely his unsuitability was plain to everyone. It should have been - he had a nearly unbroken record of personal unreliability and professional incompetence going into the first election, and by the second his record was perfect. There was simply no good argument to be made for his election, and every good argument to be made against his re-election. What did he have to offer, after all, beyond nostalgia? The bribe of lower taxes, already proven to be a sham for all but the richest few, and the continued sacrifice of our young people and our dwindling resources in a deceptively-undertaken and stupidly-executed war. By no reasonable standard could my fellow Americans, most of them anyway, see him as representing their interests. But they voted for him anyway. Why? Because Jesus is his 'favourite philosopher'. Because they felt more comfortable with him than with either of the serious, substantial men who opposed him. Because they'd rather have a beer with him!</p> <p>As the old saying has it, the turkeys voted for Thanksgiving. </p> <p>And though it is snobbish of me to say so, elitist and undemocratic, I will say that the embarrassment I've been feeling for the last seven years proceeds exactly from that sense of my fellow Americans cheerfully volunteering to be plucked, gutted, bled and hung upside down. It has made me embarrassed, as of some public foolishness by one's family, and it has made me vindictive. When I see someone being rude to a waiter, or blocking the road in a Ford Expedition, or yakking loudly on a cell phone in a crowded elevator, I naturally assume they voted for George W Bush. And - this is really mean, I know, really unfair and unreasonable and inhumane, and I scold myself for this, believe me, but - when a tornado tears off a few roofs in Texas, I think, serves you right! And I have friends in Texas. That's some of what the last seven years have done to this writer.</p> <p>Well, boo hoo, what did I expect? Didn't Jesus, and Chuang Tzu, and Shakespeare, and Mark Twain, and my other favourite philosophers all warn me about politics and politicians? Aren't I a little old for all this gnashing of teeth? I am, I am, and I fear I have years more of it ahead of me, because even now the mud is flying, and the fear machine is humming, and we're on our way back to the past.</p> <h2>Edmund White</h2> <p><strong>Novelist, short story-writer and critic, best-known for his autobiographical novels, which include A Boy's Own Story (1982). Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. </strong></p> <p>I moved back to the States from France 10 years ago and soon after my repatriation (after 16 years in Paris) Bush was elected. Although I am perhaps the least political person I know (the first time I voted in my long life was against Bush in the last presidential election), nevertheless a bad president has a depressing effect on the entire culture, no matter how strenuously one ignores him. As a gay man who has always felt that society at large despises me and that I'd be considered a criminal by most of my fellow citizens, I've never wanted to participate in electoral politics - or politics of any sort. I remember that during the Watergate trials I dismissed the whole brouhaha as 'their scandal'.</p> <p>But I had known two moments of political euphoria - Mitterrand's election and Blair's. I was in Paris for the first with French friends who were delirious, and for gays there were immediate benefits. Mitterrand acknowledged that the gay vote had helped him and he dissolved that part of the police force that was supposed to run after gays having sex in the parks at night. I was at a book party that Martin Amis and his wife were giving for me the night Blair was elected, and again I felt the exultation and got caught up in it. Unfortunately, both men turned out to be corrupt or seriously misguided.</p> <p>With Bush it was a different matter. Here was this grinning, supercilious frat boy who'd adopted a fake Texas accent (his family is from Maine), who'd managed to be 'born again' in order to attract the votes of the Christian Right, who'd been responsible for more public executions of criminals than any official in recent memory, who denied global warming, who'd evaded military service but was soon enough sending thousands of American soldiers to their deaths. Here was an oaf who wanted to give the president of Germany back rubs - which she angrily rejected - and who surrounded himself with the most blatant emblems of corporate greed in American history. During Bush's watch in the last eight years there have been four major disasters - 9/11, Iraq, Katrina and the Wall Street crash - and Bush has responded slothfully to each one. He started the war, he bungled the post-hurricane relief effort, and the deregulation that the Republicans fought so long and hard for has produced the crash.</p> <p>Perhaps the most depressing moment in the last eight years was Bush's re-election. As a teacher, I've long lamented the dumbing down of America; now I was tempted to see our educational failure as a plot to keep the electorate stupid and gullible. In America, a tiny elite receives a rigorous education and the rest of the population is kept in darkest ignorance, just as a small percentage of our youngsters constitute Olympic champion athletes and the rest of the population is grotesquely obese: a strange idea of democracy. I was prepared to believe that Dubya's first election had been a mistake or a cheat, but the idea that the voters could re-elect him was too grim to contemplate. </p> <p>As a writer, I found the whole climate under Bush particularly disheartening. Funding for the arts and humanities was at an all-time low. Whereas small bookshops have been saved in France by the Jack Lang law, which forbids discounting of books, in America independent bookstores (including the 50 or so gay ones) were wiped out by the big chains, which are now beginning to go under as well, driven out by Amazon. With our passion for deregulation and the freedom of the market, we would never defend the rights of consumers to have community bookstores (which in America are often community cultural centres) alive and well on every corner. </p> <p>After 9/11 the press was at its weakest and least vocal. I'd always been used to the liberal papers in America examining every governmental excess or infringement with a magnifying glass; now no one seemed to be looking. Most people were getting their news online and most newspapers were cutting back or closing down - and more and more of them belonged to Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, all the small independent publishers were being bought up by conglomerates, many of them in no way previously connected to the book industry. More and more titles were being published but in smaller and smaller runs; it seemed that there were no longer any common talking points among Americans.</p> <p>They lived isolated in their suburban houses, looking at hundreds of cable channels, driving through streets empty of pedestrians; America had become the saddest place on earth. The very rich had become even richer and everyone else was considerably poorer. Conveniently for the Republicans, the last great taboo in America is class. No one is allowed to mention it, not even novelists. Whereas British novelists are always beavering away defining ever more minute class differences, American writers can get a sense of contrast only by looking at the Third World. As a judge two years ago for the Granta top 20 American writers under 35 contest, the trend I most noticed is what I'd call the Peace Corps novel. Everyone is writing about India and South America and the Philippines and Vietnam - no one is writing about the big city or rural poor in America.</p> <p>I have a good friend who is a descendent of President Pierce, who was against abolition in the years leading up to the Civil War. Until now he's always been considered the worst president (there are two or three other candidates). My friend is grateful to Bush for knocking out all the competition.</p> <h2>Yiyun Li</h2> <p><strong>Won the Guardian First Book Award for her short story collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers. Her first novel, The Vagrants, will be published in the UK in February</strong></p> <p>America in the late 1990s seemed a happy place. Or perhaps it was just my exuberant naivety; having recently arrived in the country in my early twenties as a science student, I lived contentedly on a graduate stipend of $15,000 a year, watching network news and sitcoms every night to understand America. One evening I burned my hand while cooking and the next day the nurse at the students' clinic took a look at it and said, 'Honey, what on earth did you do to yourself?' </p> <p>I replied, rather shamefully, that I had been watching the coverage of the Clinton impeachment and wasn't paying attention to the bursting oil. The nurse guffawed and told me that she wanted to be the one to inform the doctor of this accident, as she could not wait to see his face when he heard the story. </p> <p>How bad could a country become when there was so much laughter around? The economy was strong, wars and genocides happened on other continents, and a mother not far from where I lived gave birth to seven babies. The biggest fear, as the turn of the century drew near, was the millennium bug - remember Y2K? - but the millennium arrived with fireworks, and without any disaster. George W Bush became President, but at the time even this looked like a laughable joke to the circle of foreign students living in our apartment building. So we laughed, not understanding how Americans could have made such a decision. </p> <p>Happiness is like childhood, always ending before one is prepared. Two years later I found a part-time job in a lab in a hospital basement, where fluorescent lamps buzzed in the windowless room. I had by then given up my science career for a dream of becoming a writer, and my lab work was simply to pay the bills. My job - rather appropriate for an aspiring writer - was to assist in research on the formation of voice. Twice a week I would go to a cardiology lab, where an exchange scholar from Bangladesh running cardiology tests on dogs would, at the end of the experiments, turn off all the switches that stopped the circulation. The dogs, still warm to the touch, waited to be dissected. </p> <p>My companion at the ordeal was Sanyukta, a PhD student from India whose dream was to become a professor in America. Neither of us wanted to perform the dissection alone, even after we had honed our skills. Having a fellow sufferer did not lessen our individual pain, but we clung on to each other's presence in those days, and walked back together to the basement with plastic bags containing the dog's vocal tissues which we had managed to cut out, and which we later tried to culture in Petri dishes. </p> <p>On other days, when we received a phone call from the autopsy unit alerting us that a human patient had agreed to donate vocal tissues, we would walk across the hospital with a bucket of dry ice, and wait for the precious tissue. It was on those days, when we felt happy that we did not have to open up a dog, that Sanyukta and I began to talk about our lives, and our conversation, inevitably, would turn to America and its present state. Our biggest fear then was that four years of a Bush administration would be a turning point for America. We understood each other's concern well; after leaving our native countries both of us had made the decision to make America home. </p> <p>'Never in history has there been a superpower that could remain a superpower,' Sanyukta liked to say. </p> <p>'For every empire that rises there will be a journey going downhill,' I would agree. 'Take China, for example.'</p> <p>'Take India,' Sanyukta agreed. 'Take Britain.'</p> <p>Toward the end of the next summer I decided to quit the job, which, like America and many of the disastrous decisions the administration had already made, had become depressing. On my last day Sanyukta bemoaned the loss of a companion to the cardiology lab. 'Ask someone else from the lab to accompany you,' I said, but she replied that the Americans in the lab, as dog lovers, would be too sensitive to take over the responsibility. 'The humility of life. That's what I think they don't know. The country has not been invaded and the people have not been ruled by another people,' Sanyukta said. 'Americans don't understand humility.'</p> <p>Bush has remained president for eight years, rather than four years as Sanyukta and I had hoped, and these years seem to have confirmed our fear in that basement lab that America is going downhill. Bad news is prevalent, both from within the country and outside: the national debt, the questionable tax cuts, and now the financial crisis; wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with human costs as high as the monetary costs; disasters of foreign policy and public diplomacy. America, at some level, reminds me of China in the late 1800s, when the country proudly considered itself the Middle Kingdom at the centre of the world. </p> <p>America no longer seems to me to be the euphorically happy place it was when I arrived. This is to be expected, as, after all, I am no longer a young Alice, eyes widened by the discovery of a marvellous wonderland. Still, America, which I consider now as my home, has taken on a soberness that would not have seemed the right mood for the country eight years ago, and perhaps this soberness will accompany America in its ongoing journey, whether it is one that goes uphill or downhill. </p> <h2>Walter Mosley</h2> <p><strong>Renowned for his crime fiction, notably the mystery series featuring detective Easy Rawlins which began with Devil in a Blue Dress (1990).</strong> </p> <p>The reign of George Bush II marks, with its passing, the end of absolute white male hegemony in American politics. Bush, along with his cronies - Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and Rove - received the strongest hand that could be dealt a sitting president and squandered the potential for true personal, party, national and international advancement. After the World Trade Centre disaster we (Americans) had the sympathy and support of much of the globe on our side. But instead of capitalising on this largesse we declared war on the world and upon our own people - especially the poor.</p> <p>Masquerading as conservative, God-fearing Republicans, Bush and his lackeys sought to shore up the cracks in white male domination through the primary religion of America - capitalism. They empowered the wealthy by eliminating restrictions on how the rich did business, by cutting the taxes of the most affluent, and by sending the poorest among us, those young people who found themselves floundering in the new economy, off to war with vague promises of glory and possible financial support later on.</p> <p>Our soldiers have been killed and maimed, scarred physically and psychologically. Most have seen no remuneration and their homeland is no safer or any more secure. </p> <p>Bush has done many things wrong. Sometimes these transgressions have hurt us but even when we are wounded we learn. We now have a glimmer of understanding why so much of the world hates us and why so many others have disdain for our archaic sense of pride and vacuous moral authority.</p> <p>Knowing something is wrong is the first step toward rehabilitation. The war we cannot win, the job we cannot save, the mortgage we cannot afford ... Much of this can be laid at the doorstep of our lame duck, bailout President. But, to be fair, he has shown many Americans the fallacy of their convictions. We can see now, better than ever before, that business as usual will not see us through.</p> <p>This said, it's hard for me to gauge the positive against the negative of the second George Bush administration. We needed to understand that the old America is gone. We have women and poor people and people of colour that must be added into the equation. We have neighbours that must be heard and questions that must be asked. Without the travesty of the past eight years I don't know how we would have gotten there. I mean, I suppose that Bush could have toned down his response to those he didn't understand; he could have sought a more peaceful coexistence with those that are different. But he didn't have the acuity to achieve a higher goal. And his excuses for his actions have some validity: his constituency placed in power the man they wanted to lead them.</p> <p>But even with all that Bush has done to throw off the balance of our world, some things have changed for the better despite him.</p> <p>The most important change occurred because of our President's conviction that he didn't mind who worked for him as long as they were faithful to his misguided worldview. Therefore he could have two African-American Secretaries of State, one after the other. This action helped to open the door for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And once the door is opened it can never be fully closed again.</p> <p>The black apologists for Bush's lies and Cheney's avarice cleared the way for Obama. Americans, millions of them, are, for the first time, considering somebody other than the white male candidate. This was bound to happen sooner or later but Bush's racial blindness and political irresponsibility, I believe, pushed the envelope a bit faster. </p> <p>Never again will we be the nation concerned only with the liberation and security of the white man's property. It doesn't matter who wins our election. America has changed for good. The people will continue to demand fairness and equality. They will demand that our actions in the world be considered and considerate of different points of view. Black and brown and Asian men and women will throw their hats into the ring, not as brainwashed servants but as people who see us all as a part of that pulsing, bulging mass of humanity that struggles to survive in this ever-growing, ever-shrinking world.</p> <h2>Rick Moody</h2> <p><strong>Bestselling novel The Ice Storm (1994) was made into a film directed by Ang Lee. His memoir, The Black Veil (2002) was also widely acclaimed.</strong></p> <p>'The business of America is business,' Calvin Coolidge, 30th President of the United States, was reputed to have said in January of 1925, just four years shy of Black Friday and the onset of the Great Depression. </p> <p>It's not hard to think of George W Bush mangling some similar perception, though at the time of his own ascension to the presidency in January 2001, Bush hadn't yet been very successful at business. Not if his stewardship of Arbusto Energy or Harken Energy is any indication. It wasn't until Bush became general partner of a professional baseball team, the Texas Rangers, that he made any real money at all. Nevertheless, Bush drank deep of the lessons of American capitalism, as he pointed out himself in December of 2000: 'I understand small business growth. I was one.'</p> <p>This was W as we first experienced him. The President who timidly, awkwardly succeeded Bill Clinton and who oversaw the bitter end of the so-called New Economy. It would be easy to pin all the blame for diminished corporate earnings and emptied tax coffers and a weak dollar and a huge trade imbalance on Bush, but neither was Clinton's administration free of its share of economic bluster, and neither was Clinton shy about transitioning away from investment in the public sector, as with predecessors like Ronald Reagan and Bush the Elder. This part of the march of history George W Bush inherited, the period after the internet stock bubble, which meant that things were already, early in his presidency, grim, unstable, uncertain. According to the only political model he knew, the business model, Bush's newly minted administration immediately moved to invite Kenneth Lay (of the soon-to-be former Enron Corporation) to closed-door meetings with Dick Cheney, as well as to the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Other CEOs found similar welcome. The hangover from the internet bubble was hard enough to live with, but Bush, by putting all or most of federal operations up for sale, inaugurated an even more challenging epoch. Call it the 'Years of Shareholder Value', since, as Bush often opined, government needed to behave more like a business.</p> <p>After 11 September, though, the sinister legacy of the Bush years has lain in the free-market approach to the war itself, to the war and its aftermath. How quickly after the initial air campaigns and the collapse of Baghdad were Vice President Cheney's former corporate colleagues, Halliburton, and its subsidiaries, engaged in the securing of Iraqi resources for American corporations and their shareholders. Bush then attempted to bring home the same lessons to domestic affairs.</p> <p>The Ownership Society! That was the name for this second term of Bush's America, and it's logical to assume Bush didn't come up with the coinage himself, because how could he have? He has trouble getting through a simple sentence. Probably some staffer, gifted with ad speak, came up with it, coining what was already de facto policy, the notion that the government needs to remove itself entirely from the business of regulation and owning industries, leaving the oversight of corporate capital - as well as derivatives, packaged mortgages, and so on - to an ill-equipped marketplace. </p> <p>What the Ownership Society came to feel like to the overwhelming majority of Americans was feudalism. The modern return of the robber barons. No backstop in the case of catastrophic illness. No backstop in case of corporate malfeasance. No backstop in the case of a despoiled natural environment. No backstop in the case of cascading corporate bankruptcies. The wealthy and the large corporations, now largely unregulated, were free to do as they wished in most if not all areas, in order to increase the bounteous riches of their executives. If only the barely getting by worked harder and saved more, they too might count on the American Dream coming true in their own lives! If not in this generation then in the next!</p> <p>Home ownership is perhaps the shining example of this heartless model of economic progress. The first Bush term yielded to the second, and the unregulated market for homes and mortgages helped make possible the fiscal environment in which a great number of Americans were using real estate speculation as a way to create wealth that was otherwise lost to them in a flat stock market and in the galloping disappearance of the middle class. The banks, initially thriving on the loans and fees required for all this transacting, turned a blind eye to the kind of money being borrowed and often to the desperate people doing the borrowing. Which brings us to where we are today: mired in a precipitous slump in part inaugurated by the failure of booby-trapped mortgages that ought not to have been tendered, loans that ennobled neither borrower nor lender. In addition to facing energy and food prices that are climbing as steadily as their credit card bills, regular middle-class Americans are finding that they are now less likely to be members of the Ownership Society than of the Insolvent Society. </p> <p>The darker American fears meanwhile remain. The fear, the uncertainty, that end-of-empire anxiety. You can see the fear in the demonisation of undocumented workers in the United States. Fear of anything that will unsettle a rank-and-file white voter, the white voter who fears the United States of the future will no longer have a place for him. All of this fear pushes both sides of the electorate toward divisive political rhetoric, class hatred, racialist thinking, and so on. And it sure doesn't improve our diminished reputation abroad.</p> <p>Turns out, meanwhile, that Calvin Coolidge said a lot of other things in that speech from January 1925 - the one in which he said: 'After all, the chief business of the American people is business.' He also said: 'We make no concealment of the fact that we want wealth, but there are many other things that we want very much more. We want peace and honour, and that charity which is so strong an element of all civilisation. The chief ideal of the American people is idealism. I cannot repeat too often that America is a nation of idealists. That is the only motive to which they ever give any strong and lasting reaction.' The bulk of Coolidge's speech seems to have been effaced in these Years of Shareholder Value. These days, a speech remarking that there are 'many things we want more than wealth' might be construed as being anti-business. And in the United States, the anti-business political candidate is even harder to elect than the atheist. Still, maybe, just maybe, these ideals to which Coolidge alluded to are still throbbing in the American consciousness somewhere. Let's hope the years after the Years of Shareholder Value come quickly.</p> <h2>Siri Hustvedt</h2> <p><strong>Novelist, essayist and poet whose most recent novel, The Sorrows of an American, came out this year. Married to fellow writer Paul Auster.</strong></p> <p>Every political moment has a particular rhetorical climate. Language matters, not only because it articulates the dominant ideas of a period but because it shapes our perceptions of the world. For years, Americans have been listening to a president who has essentially cut the world in two. We are 'the protectors of freedom' fighting the 'evil-doers' who 'hate freedom'. Manipulating words for ideological purposes is hardly new. When it is effective, it creates an emotional response in the listener, a rush in the limbic system that can call on the deepest feelings we have as human beings. George W Bush and his administration chose to appeal to our fears.</p> <p>Playing on the age-old fear of malignant outsiders and foreigners, both those residing on American soil and elsewhere, the administration successfully created an atmosphere of absolutism after 11 September 2001. The exhortation 'If you're not with us, you're with the terrorists' is a form of political speech that makes dialogue impossible. There is no legitimate response because anyone who counters with another thought has already been lumped with an inhuman enemy. In psychiatric parlance, rigid polarities like those the President has made time and again are regarded as pathological: 'splitting'. The patient is unable to tolerate ambiguity and insists on viewing the people in his life through an 'all good' or 'all bad' lens. Bush and his cohorts have been masterful splitters, employing a language that gives no room for exchange and necessarily distorts reality, which, unfortunately, is usually murky. This kind of speech does not recognise an interlocutor, a real human other. It is speech without empathy, and it is startlingly similar to the rhetoric of the Muslim radicals who spew venom on the West and 'the enemies of Islam'.</p> <p>To be sure, there is something all too human about this phenomenon. The need for simple juxtapositions of good and evil, heroes and villains, is ubiquitous. It is the stuff of most Hollywood movies and many popular books. Nuance is discarded for easy clarity. It is possible that George W Bush actually views the world in these black and white terms, that his mind is as blunt and unrefined as his impromptu sentences. His now well-known emphasis on loyalty from those who work for him may be an indication of an 'all for' or 'all against' way of thinking. I don't know. I do know that the ironies are multiple. </p> <h2>Aleksandar Hemon</h2> <p><strong>Bosnian-Herzegovinian writer and journalist based in Chicago. His latest novel, The Lazarus Project, is a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award.</strong> </p> <p>I became an American citizen in November 2000, around the time of the infamous electoral impasse and the Supreme Court decision that gifted George W Bush his first presidency. I had ended up in the USA in 1992 because of the war in Bosnia. For eight years I was an alien resident - a contradiction in terms - before I decided to cross the big threshold and fully enter the home of the brave. Hence my first fledgling-American sentiment was full-fledged embarrassment at the democratic process that allowed the candidate for whom the minority of voters had cast their ballots to become the President of all. </p> <p>What made things worse was that W was/is the American stereotype come true - ignorant, incurious, congenitally uncomfortable with thought. Take this: in January 2000, at an Iowa community college, he succinctly laid out his future foreign policy, complete with its idiocy, in these immortal words: 'When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were. It was us vs them, and it was clear who them was. Today we are not sure who the they are, but we know they're there.'</p> <p>But the quaint days of mere embarrassment ended abruptly on 11 September 2001, when the 'they' conveniently arrived in hijacked planes and tragically split American history into pre- and post-9/11 periods. I distinctly remember Bush addressing the discombobulated nation that day and saying: 'Freedom itself was attacked.' This at the time when television still showed footage of desperate New Yorkers leaping into certain, horrifying death off the Towers that would collapse in the next image. It seemed possible at that moment that tens of thousands had perished. </p> <p>It was impossible not to feel, deep in your body, the horror and the solidarity in response to the immense suffering. But all that our good President could come up with was a vacuous stock phrase. 'We're fucked,' I remember thinking. If he was capable of converting the terrible concreteness of human pain into a cheap abstraction, then American - let alone human - lives mean nothing to him.</p> <p>And fucked we were. Before long, the stock abstraction exploded into splendid and insufferable fireworks of banality celebrating the now-eternal struggle between the US and the freedom-hating they. Few Americans today wish to recall the time that led up to the invasion of Iraq and the Mission-Accomplished pageant, the time when Bush's approval rating was happily in the nineties; when Arab-looking citizens, including a number of Sikhs, were subject to vengeful assaults; when vulgar patriotism was enforced by ranting pundits and radio-talk-show hosts calling for nuking the towelheads; when French fries became freedom fries (and French kissing became freedom kissing.) This was the shameful time when editorial boards rushed to endorse the new-fangled Bush doctrine and the upcoming cakewalk in Iraq; when journalists at the White House press conferences dully followed the pre-approved script and war correspondents eagerly signed up to be embedded. This was when a vast majority of Americans, liberal and conservative, believed in the mirage of Saddam's WMD, which were - if I may say so as a novice at things American - blatantly and obviously non-existent. Few Americans care to recall those days because the only appropriate reaction to them is deep and humbling shame, and we are a proud people.</p> <p>George W Bush is the worst president in American history not only because everything he and his flunkeys touched instantly turned into long-lasting shit but because he brought out the worst in my fellow citizens and even some fellow foreigners (say, Tony Blair). He built a coalition of the willing participants in a criminal, immoral debacle that the Iraq adventure has been from start to not-in-sight finish. Any war criminal knows that if moral self-denial attains the shape of national pride, anything is possible, any crime can be explained away as either necessary or an honest mistake. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, the destruction of Fallujah, torture as government policy, waterboarding as a common word, extraordinary renditions, the suspension of habeas corpus, unfettered eavesdropping, the diminishment of mechanisms of American democracy, the unaccountable government - not only did it all become acceptable to the majority of voters in the 2004 elections, it appeared as pride-inducing strength.</p> <p>I am no historian but it is my guess that the Bush regime would be in the running for the worst elected government in the history of Western civilisation. The score sheet is catastrophic: American foreign policy and international prestige are in tatters; the deficit and the national debt are reaching Zimbabwean proportions; states are impoverished and national infrastructure is falling apart; the practices of democracy have been so devalued that a militant bimbo is a viable vice-presidential candidate, while race-baiting is acceptable campaign practice. What to say of the destruction of New Orleans and the collapse of financial markets, neither of which the Bush court seemed particularly interested in until it was too late? Nothing Bush and his administration handled has remained undamaged, no stone misturned, all children left behind to forage through the debris in the aftermath of the past eight years.</p> <h2>Uzodinma Iweala</h2> <p><strong>Won John Llewellyn Rhys prize for Beasts of No Nation (2005). Chosen as one of Granta's Best Young American Novelists in 2007. He now attends Columbia University medical school.</strong></p> <p>George W Bush was elected President of the United States just after my 18th birthday on 7 November 2000. I remember clearly the atmosphere on Harvard's campus. It was a bit subdued because Harvard and its students tend to favour the left, but at the same time somewhat triumphant because whichever candidate, Bush or Gore, won, there would be a Harvard man in the White House. I also remember that I didn't vote. I couldn't vote because I was new to the political process and I didn't register to vote in time. And that ignorance is something that haunts me to this day.</p> <p>This was before 11 September 2001, when President Bush was caricatured as an idiot, but a thoroughly benign one who, if he didn't choke on another Pretzel, would at most spend four years under the direction of his tutor Vice President Cheney before America came to its senses and booted him out in favour of someone more worthy of the office, when his ideas of compassionate conservatism were wholly embraced by some and met with cautious acceptance by others, when as a nation we were still optimistic about our future and sure of our role as a shining example for the world. That has all changed.</p> <p>It sometimes seems that the last eight years have been a highly comical nightmare for the US and President Bush has been the comedic villain. This is the man who instructed us to shop our way out of a national tragedy, who plotted an illegal war based on the most nonsensical of lies that some of us chose to believe. This is the man who transformed torture into enhanced interrogation. This is the man who sat back unconcerned while one of his appointees mismanaged one of the biggest crises in American history - Hurricane Katrina - saying 'he's doing a heck of a job'. And now towards the end of his term, as he chest bumps graduating college seniors and tap dances before the start of press conferences, the war into which he has dragged young Americans rages and our economy slowly disintegrates. That has been the last eight years. For someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I have never wanted to wake up so badly. </p> <p>But perhaps most troubling is what his presidency has done to America's opinion of itself. Where once we were a society that honoured excellence and achievement, the last eight years of President Bush have taught us to aspire to the lowest common denominator. As a country, we now feel that we shouldn't have to pay taxes and yet we still feel entitled to government services. As a country, we feel that we should take the easy road and drill for more oil instead of tightening our belts, parking our SUVs and investing money in alternative energy. As a country, we have allowed our news media to turn politics into a farce with personalities who rant and rave and journalists who trade integrity for access, reporting spoon-fed propaganda as actual news. As a country, we now collectively prefer presidents whom we could 'have a beer with' instead of leaders who will challenge us to rise above our petty insecurities and wants to risk something for our country. </p> <p>But it makes perfect sense. Why should we aspire to more when the decider in chief of the last eight years is a man who waltzed into the presidency on the legacy of his father (just as he waltzed into college, business and the governorship of Texas) and has refused to take responsibility for any of his failures? In my opinion, 'giving up golf', as he claimed, is not atonement enough for the American and Iraqi lives he has jeopardised. When our President has time and again refused to take the hard road towards excellence and deem torture illegal, and tell Americans we need to reduce our energy footprints, or truly invest in education for our young people, what are we supposed to do?</p> <p>The lowest moment of the last eight years for me happened at a school in Baltimore. I gave a talk to an auditorium full of high school students on the subject of war. We began speaking about the Iraq war and, of 500 students, 499 seemed to believe that Iraq had attacked us first and that we were totally justified in invading their country. Only one diminutive freshman in that school of mostly large athletic boys stood up and said: 'Guys. What we're doing over there is not right.' It hurt me to think that after eight years of President Bush, this is the future of America - group-think based on falsities and jingoist myths with dissent offered by only a very few.</p> <p>This has been my political coming of age, watching our President preside over a gaggle of squabbling politicians too fearful to do their jobs and drive the country towards excellence, and a population too beholden to the pursuit of personal gain and the politics of fear to demand more of them. </p> <p>It's only in George W Bush's America that 'community organiser' can be used as a slander and the words 'hope' and 'change' can be ridiculed as meaningless and empty. </p> <p>This is not the same country that I lived in as a teenager, when Teach for America was as important as military service and the word American was golden in the ears of our fellow global citizens. Like I said, I want to wake up. Many of us do, and for the first time in Barack Obama we have found a candidate who seems ready to ring the alarm clock, no matter how annoyed we get as a nation. I'm not an Obamaniac, as people derisively call his supporters, but I recognise that, for the first time in my political life, someone has stood up and said: 'America, it's time to make some hard choices.' </p> <p>In two months, this eight-year journey under the guidance of President Bush through the valleys of mediocrity will either come to an end with Barack Obama or continue for another four, perhaps even eight years with John McCain. </p> <p>On 7 November 2000 I could claim I was naive. On 4 November 2008, there can be no excuses.</p> <h2>Andover to Afghanistan: The life of George W Bush</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> </p> <p><strong>6 July 1946</strong> In New Haven, Connecticut, the oldest child of Barbara Bush and George HW Bush, US President from 1989 to 1993.

  "<p>In the early Sixties the young George Ivan Morrison briefly played saxophone in a Belfast showband called the Olympics. Once, before a gig in Derry, the band's minibus pulled up outside his house on Hyndford Street, east Belfast and lead singer Alfie Walsh knocked on the door. Van's mother, Violet, answered, and after a few seconds of banter Walsh returned to the minibus alone. 'Yer man can't play,' he told the other band members. 'His ma says he's not coming out... He's upstairs in his room writing poetry.' </p> <p>Though this anecdote may have grown in the telling, it illustrates the adolescent Van Morrison's otherness. A working-class boy from a Protestant neighbourhood, he had left Orangefield school with no academic credentials, and seems to have been an aloof-to-the-point-of-arrogant teenager; an only child who never quite shed his sense of aloneness. Years later, when his Belfast peers recalled the young Morrison, they stressed his solitary nature as well as his eccentricity. 'Van was his own master,' his boyhood friend George Jones told biographer Johnny Rogan. 'People didn't understand him.' Another friend, Billy McAllen, remembered him as being 'a bit strange, a bit weird'. </p> <p>Fast forward to 25 September 1968. Morrison, 23, and already in retreat from pop stardom, stands in the centre of Century Sound Studios in midtown Manhattan. In the past few years he had tasted fame as lead singer of Them (dubbed 'Belfast's answer to the Rolling Stones' in the music press), singing on two hit singles, 'Here Comes the Night' and the proto-punk 'Gloria'. His first solo album - released in 1967, and entitled, in the spirit of the time, Blowin' Your Mind - had yielded another hit, the buoyant 'Brown-Eyed Girl'. Now, though, newly signed to Warner Brothers, he was intent on reinvention . </p> <p>Strumming gently on an acoustic guitar, he begins to sing the first of several strange, stark songs he has been recently performing in small venues on the east coast to general disinterest. Around him, listening intently, are gathered three jazz musicians of the highest calibre: bassist Richard Davis, who had played with the likes of Miles Davis and Sarah Vaughan, guitarist Jay Berliner, best known for his work with Charles Mingus, and drummer Connie Kay, a member of the esteemed Modern Jazz Quartet. They had been assembled, alongside arranger Larry Fallon, by producer Lewis Merenstein, who on first hearing the songs had immediately sensed that they would not work in a rock setting. </p> <p>If the young Van Morrison felt awed in such exalted company, he did not show it. In fact, he betrayed little emotion at all, and throughout the session, spoke only to the technicians. 'There wasn't much communication,' recalls Richard Davis, who now teaches music at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 'As far as I can recall, I don't think I exchanged one word with the guy. We just listened to his songs one time, and then we started playing.' </p> <p>Brooks Arthur was the sound engineer on that same session, though, inexplicably, his name would be left off the subsequent album credits. When he talks about it today, 40 years later, regret soon turns to excitement in his voice. 'From the moment Van hit the first note I knew we were involved in something special,' he recalls. 'You have to understand, everything was live. There were no music charts. He ran it down once for the players and went into the vocal booth. Then we got the sound levels right and I hit the red light and he started singing.' </p> <p>That first working day comprised two three-and-a-half-hour studio sessions, during which three extended songs were recorded. 'There wasn't too much stopping and starting,' says Arthur. 'Van took off and the musicians went with him. They were serious players, they didn't have to think about it, they just did it instinctively, and it caught fire. We were working at the speed of sound. I tell you, we were breathing rarefied air in there.'</p> <p>On 15 October the musicians and sound men reconvened. In another two short sessions, according to Merenstein, they produced 'six or seven songs, two of which just didn't fit the mood of the album'. Larry Fallon then spent another day overdubbing strings and horns on certain tracks. Throughout Morrison remained uncommunicative, self-absorbed. 'People told me later that he was shy,' says Davis, 'but to me he seemed aloof, maybe a bit moody. He was caught up in his own thing. He communicated through his singing.' </p> <p>It still seems scarcely credible that, under such strained conditions, an album was created that has since come to be regarded as perhaps the greatest work of art to emerge out of the pop tradition. Released in November 1968, Astral Weeks is a work of such singular beauty, such sustained emotional intensity, that nothing recorded before or since sounds even remotely similar - or, indeed, comparable. Elvis Costello would later describe it as 'still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium', adding that 'there hasn't been a record with that amount of daring made since'. When I spoke to Nick Cave about it a few years ago, he spoke enviously of 'its power to mesmerise and disturb', and wondered 'at the sheer nerve of this young guy to attempt something so obsessive and uncompromising, and then actually pull it off'. </p> <p>Initially, though, Astral Weeks was greeted by both the critics and the public with utter bemusement. The NME compared Morrison's extraordinary voice to the mannered Latin stylings of Jos\u00e9 Feliciano. Initial sales were disappointing and it received little support from Warner Brothers. 'They just didn't know what to do with it so they did nothing,' says Merenstein, scathingly. 'They were expecting \"Brown Eyed Girl\", and the first thing I played them was a seven-minute song about rebirth with no electric guitars and an acoustic bass. They just shook their heads.' </p> <p>Since then though Astral Weeks has gone from a cult album to an acknowledged classic and has been celebrated, alongside the likes of Dylan's Blonde on Blonde and the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's, in countless best albums of all-time lists. It was voted No 2 in a Mojo magazine critics' poll of 1995 and at No 19 in Rolling Stone's selection of the 500 Greatest Albums Ever Made in 2003. More surprisingly, it was also voted ninth greatest album of all time in the more populist Music of the Millennium poll conducted by Channel 4, the Guardian, HMV and Classic FM in 1997. </p> <p>Now comes the news that the ever-contrary Morrison, having continually shrugged off Astral Weeks' legendary status in interviews over the years, will be performing the album in its entirety at two shows at the Hollywood Bowl on November 7-8. The concerts are an intriguing prospect but it turns out that I am not alone in wondering at the wisdom of such a risky undertaking. 'How does that old Buddhist saying go?' says Merenstein. 'Something like, \"You can't bathe in the same river twice.\" I hear he is going to record the concerts for a live album, too. Man, I have mixed feelings about that. Part of me thinks, just leave it alone. It's a moment in time that has become timeless. It's just too unique, too magical to try and recreate.'</p> <p>Astral Weeks is that rare thing in pop music, an album that lives up to its own legend. Its singularity lies, as Costello points out, in its vaulting ambition. It is neither folk nor jazz nor blues, though there are traces of all three in the music and in Morrison's raw and emotionally charged singing. There are no solos save for the ethereal flute and soprano saxophone improvisations that are woven through the last, and shortest, song, 'Slim Slow Slider', the album's elegaic coda. Throughout, there are interludes of breathtaking beauty when the music surges and subsides, rises and falls, around Morrison's voice. </p> <p>And it is that voice, by turns flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive, that is the most extraordinary instrument of all. It is the sound of someone singing to himself, utterly immersed in the words that are pouring out of his mouth. This is that adolescent aloofness transmuted into a kind of enraptured self-assurance. 'His voice has so much integrity and conviction,' says the singer Beth Orton. 'It's as if he has sung the whole album into being just by his conviction, his absolute self-belief.'</p> <p>At times Morrison seems overwhelmed by the intensity of the feelings he is attempting to express. 'His voice is a thing of quite extreme beauty,' says the psychologist and author Adam Phillips, a longtime fan of the album. 'What is extraordinary is the emotional atmosphere he creates in the songs and the sense that he is not even remotely concerned about communicating with an audience or a listener. He's just singing out his songs, and we are, in a sense, listening in.'</p> <p>It has long been my contention that Astral Weeks is an album rooted in adolescence; its confusions and frustrations, its often volcanic emotional turbulence. On 'Cyprus Avenue' he is 'caught' and 'captured' by adolescent sexual desire, and 'conquered in a car seat'. On 'Beside You', the most dense and tortured song on the album, he sounds traumatised - though by what one never knows. </p> <p>'On Astral Weeks I think he is haunted by something,' says Phillips, 'and I am not even sure he knows what it is. He sounds confounded, literally confounded. I don't think he has a clue what this music is about, other than it comes from somewhere deep inside him. As a psychologist, one often encounters people who harbour these sort of confused feelings but what you don't very often encounter is someone who has found a form for them. That is what is startling here, and almost unique in the medium of popular music.'</p> <p>For all that, there is a mood of exultancy and, in places, abandonment, on Astral Weeks: words break down or are repeated until they lose their literal meaning and become mantras of desire and loss. 'I always think Astral Weeks sounds somehow victorious,' says Beth Orton. 'It's as if he has won a great victory but lost so much too. He sounds altered.'</p> <p>There are few moments in popular music as affecting as the repeated refrain on 'Madame George' of the line, 'dry your eye, your eye, your eye...' as the strings swell around his voice then fall away, leaving just his acoustic strumming and Davis's wonderfully insistent bass pulse. It is the sound of someone trying to retrieve the irretrievable: lost youth, lost innocence, lost love; and at the same time realising the impossibility of ever experiencing those heightened moments again. </p> <p>Astral Weeks is also a long goodbye, both to his younger self and to the city of his youth, a prelapsarian Belfast untouched by bomb or bullet. It was recorded just as the Troubles began, and remains, alongside Derek Mahon's poetry and Gerald Dawe's memoir, My Mother-City, one of the most tender...#65279; evocations of a straight-laced and hard-edged city, whose more progressive youth were embracing the creeping bohemianism of the times. On his brief return to Belfast after Them split, Morrison hung out for a time with an arty student crowd, but he was an outsider there too.</p> <p>The two songs on Astral Weeks that are most infused with a sense of place - 'Cyprus Avenue' and 'Madame George' - are also undercut with the deepest sense of melancholy and longing. 'What he is tapping into on those songs is a collective experience,' says Dawe, a Belfast-born poet who knew the young Van Morrison. 'It's about describing the familiar in extraordinary detail, even as you are leaving that familiarity behind once and for all. Van grew up in an intense, tight-knit community, and knew early on that he did not fit into that community, that he was, as artists often are, an outsider. That feeling was really brought home to him when he returned to Belfast after his brief pop stardom. He didn't fit, and knew he would have to leave again, this time for good. All those complex emotions echo through Astral Weeks. That's why it resonates so deeply with people from home, many of whom have left there with the same anxieties of belonging.' </p> <p>Astral Weeks may be the moment when Van Morrison accepts that he can never truly go home again. 'Ain't nothing but a stranger in this world,' he sings towards the end of the title track, echoing the gospel hymns of his youth. 'I got a home on high...' </p> <p>When I interviewed Morrison back in 1987 he did not want to talk about Astral Weeks at all. We met in the Chelsea Arts Club. He arrived very late and for the first hour was tight-lipped and combative. It was only when we moved off the subject of his music that he began to open up. 'Basically, Irish writers, and I include myself here, are writing about the same things,' he mused at one point. 'Often it's about when things felt better. Either that, or sadness... It's the story about going back and rediscovering that going back answers the question, or going back and discovering it doesn't answer the question. Going away and coming back, those are the themes of all Irish writing.'</p> <p>In a way, Van Morrison has grappled with those same themes ever since. For a long time his albums were about the great quest for home, the search for a place to belong, be that a tradition or a belief system or an actual landscape. In his songs he has drawn on Romanticism and esoteric theosophy, and evoked the names of John Donne and WB Yeats, TS Eliot and Seamus Heaney. On Astral Weeks, though, there is no questing. He is simply there, transported by his words and his voicing of them. No one in popular music, including Van Morrison himself, has since come close to that exalted place .</p> <h2>1968 and all that </h2> <p><strong>In the news</strong><br><strong>5 November</strong> Richard Nixon narrowly beats Hubert Humphrey in the US presidential elections. <br><strong>26 November </strong>New race relations law in the UK makes it illegal to refuse housing, jobs or public services on ethnic grounds.<br><strong>30 November</strong> The Trade Descriptions Act outlaws the selling of an item with a misleading label or description.</p> <p><strong>At the cinema </strong><br><strong>Barbarella</strong> Jane Fonda plays the 41st-century astronaut in this hedonistic sci-fi romp. <br><strong>Oliver!</strong> Musical version of Charles Dickens's classic tale. <br><strong>Girl on a Motorcycle</strong> Road movie with Marianne Faithful. </p> <p><strong>In the shops </strong><br>Sliced white loaf - 1s 7d (8\u00bdp)<br>Pint of milk - 11d (4\u00bdp) <br>Bag of sugar - 1/4 (6\u00bdp) <br>20 cigarettes - 4/10 (24p) </p> <p><strong>On the radio </strong><br>'Those Were the Days' - Mary Hopkin<br>'Hey Jude' - The Beatles<br>'With a Little Help from My Friends' - Joe Cocker</p> <p><strong>At the theatre </strong><br><strong>Hair</strong> Controversial rock'n'roll musical. <br><strong>Forty Years On</strong> Alan Bennett's first West End play. <br><strong>The Real Inspector Hound</strong> Tom Stoppard's farcical whodunnit. </p> <p><strong>On the bookshelves </strong><br><strong>The Armies of the Night</strong> Normal Mailer's Pulitzer-winning nonfiction novel.<br><strong>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test </strong>Tom Wolfe's pioneering account of Merry Pranksterism. <br><strong>Eva Trout</strong> Elizabeth Bowen's last major work. <strong>Ally Carnwath</strong></p> <h2>How Van the man found his voice</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> George Ivan Morrison on 31 August 1945 at 125 Hyndford Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Courtesy of his father George's extensive jazz and blues record collection, he grows up listening to the likes of Ray Charles, Leadbelly and Mahalia Jackson. </p> <p><strong>1958</strong> Joins the Sputniks as a saxophone player.

  "<p>What really stands out in my memory now is that we had such a great cast. You'd never get that strength in depth these days. Normally, you can cast two or three strong parts but we had seven or eight cracking actors all blazing away. I think they all, individually, thought it was 'their' film. There were no supporting actors in Trainspotting.</p> <p>I remember having to reassure Ewan McGregor constantly, because he felt he wasn't doing enough and that's when I learned to have someone who had a stillness at the centre of your film, someone who could be the audience's eyes. </p> <p>The special feeling I remember about Trainspotting was that holy grail of when your own people go to watch their own films. It happens so rarely, that British audiences flock to a British movie, when they see a film about their own country, their own lives, their own culture. The Full Monty did it, too, and I think the success of both was that they didn't make concessions to America - they kept the feel that made them uniquely British.</p> <p>But we were also helped by a general climate of change. That Thatcher era was being swept away in a tide of increasingly ludicrous sex stories, financial misdoings and football managers getting done for bungs in service stations. I always believe that popular culture will eventually say 'fuck this', and create an energy to sweep it away. We got it in house music, Britpop, and you could sense it in the commercial success that greeted something as non-mainstream as Trainspotting.</p> <p>Has it dated? I can't tell you that. I am alarmed sometimes by how young the people are who say they've seen and loved Trainspotting, so it might have lost an edge it once had. Shallow Grave looks dated, fashion-wise, but Trainspotting has an abiding style.</p> <p>I remember Jonny [Lee Miller] and Ewan turning up for the scene where they shoot a pitbull in a park. It was near the end of the filming, and Ewan had been on an apocalyptic diet to get that junkie look, but he'd succumbed and had been on a bender and the two of them turned up wasted. So we had to adapt and shoot the scene as if they were wasted.</p> <p>I remember shooting the loo scene very clearly. Credit to the designer Kave Quinn and to Brian Tufano, the great cinematographer, because we did it without CGI. We did it the old-fashioned way, like you would in the theatre, with a cut-away toilet. And the camera trick, the illusion, is that it's a complete toilet.</p> <p>We were a bit stuck and then Brian said to Ewan: 'Why don't you just twist your feet round at the end and it'll look like you've disappeared down the U-bend?' That was all it took, a little twist, and it clinched that scene and made it one everyone remembers.</p> <p>It was shot in an old cigarette factory, the disused Wills factory, in Glasgow, emptied of machines and walls but it was perfect for us. That's where most British films were shot in the Nineties, in all the decayed industrial space of the nation. They're all luxury flats now, so perhaps a certain spirit has been lost.</p> <p>\u2022 Danny Boyle was talking to Jason Solomons. His new film, Slumdog Millionaire, is released in January</p>",
  "<p>The NHS is paying for tens of thousands of overweight and obese people to attend private slimming clubs, according to new figures.</p> <p>More than 30,000 patients have been referred to WeightWatchers and Slimming World as part of an NHS initiative launched last year to help GPs fight Britain's growing obesity problem. One in four of the 188 primary care trusts and health boards in Britain is working with WeightWatchers and more than one in five is working with Slimming World, although some health trusts might be working with both clubs.</p> <p>Health trusts that buy vouchers from the commercial weight loss organisations say the approach is about a third cheaper than alternative approaches, such as slimming drugs and 'tummy tuck' operations including gastric bands and gastric bypasses. The programmes, which focus on education and transforming lifestyles, claim to be more successful in achieving permanent weight loss than the alternatives.</p> <p>'Although we were initially hesitant about paying a private commercial organisation to provide services for us, we now have no qualms at all,' said Natalie Field, associate director of public health at Bristol Primary Care Trust. 'We're absolutely delighted with the success of this scheme.'</p> <p>Bristol has been running a pilot project since 2004 and now has all 57 of its GP practices signed up. Last month, the trust expanded the scheme, encouraging GPs to prescribe a second 12-week course for patients who lose five per cent of their body weight during the first programme. Vouchers for slimming clubs cost about \u00a340 for a three-month course. A month's supply of drugs to aid slimming costs between \u00a325 and \u00a344.</p> <p>'A small-scale evaluation in 2004 of our scheme suggests that cost per kilogram lost is \u00a316 for patients receiving support through our slimming club programme compared to \u00a350 for drug therapy,' said Field. 'We have referred over 2,200 patients to the scheme. Attendance is high and initial results suggest that not only do patients keep the weight off, but the weight loss continues,' she added. </p> <p>Dr Jacquie Lavin, nutritionist and health partnerships manager of Slimming World, said the scheme had benefits for patients and the NHS. 'Drugs do work but they are short term, can have unpleasant side-effects and can be dangerous for those with high blood pressure, which is something most overweight people suffer from,' she said. </p> <p>The NHS was given the green light to work with slimming organisations in January when the government published its 'Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives' cross-government strategy for England. </p> <p>Sally Cornfield is in charge of weight loss programmes for the Dudley Primary Care Trust in the West Midlands. 'Here in Dudley we have well above the national average of adults and children who are overweight and well above the national average of those who are obese. We also have one of the least active populations in the country,' she said. 'We are tackling this with a number of services but the referrals we make to WeightWatchers are by far our most popular option.</p> <p>'Doctors can be wary of sending people to groups away from the surgery. But we have had such excellent feedback that we are now finding people are asking for referrals. We are getting requests to refer patients to WeightWatchers at the rate of around 500 a month.'</p> <p>Slimming World and WeightWatchers say that, on average, patients referred by their GPs lose 4.3kg (9.5lb) over the first 12 weeks, with 39 per cent of patients losing more than 5 per cent of their initial weight.</p> <p>Audrey O'Brien, head of service innovation at WeightWatchers, called the scheme 'seminal'. 'The NHS has always been reticent to work with private organisations but there has been a real shift in that thinking,' she said. 'There is a recognition that we need a cross-societal approach to fight this battle. There is no one element of society that can be adapted to fix obesity. We have to transform entire lifestyles, and that's what slimming clubs teach our patients.'</p> <h2>'If the NHS is paying for it, I thought I'd better make it work'</h2> <p>Molly Young, 64, from Ayrshire, weighed 15 stone 5lb and was a dress size 22 when her health trust offered her a free 12-week WeightWatchers course. She now weighs 11 stone 8lb and is a size 14.</p> <p>'I have diabetes, had recently undergone one knee replacement and was on the waiting list to have the other one replaced too. I was taking strong pain killers, my cholesterol levels were high and so was my blood pressure.</p> <p>'One day, my chemist told me about a free trial for WeightWatchers meetings. I thought \"Well, if the NHS is prepared to pay for me to go, I had better stick to it and make it work\". Because it was someone else's money I didn't want to let them down.'</p> <p>It took Molly a year to lose four stone but her weight loss has reduced the pain in her knee and she no longer needs the second operation, saving the NHS about \u00a310,000. She now walks miles each day with her 15-month-old grandson.</p> <p>'My only regret is that I left it so long before losing the weight. If I had known how it would transform my life I would have done it years ago. To walk with no pain, not to have the fear of another knee operation and to have my diabetes under control is marvellous.'</p>",
  "<p>Just when they thought they had seen the last of their ex-spouse, divorcees might need to prepare for a letter delivering a rude financial shock. </p> <p>With the leap in redundancies in the City and elsewhere, exes living on payments from their former breadwinning spouses may soon be asked to accept lower payments as the income, bonuses and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/redundancy\">redundancy</a> money fizzle out. </p> <p>England has one of the most generous systems in Europe when it comes to the time over which court-ordered maintenance must be paid. Whereas in Scotland exes have an income lifeline for three years at most, and help is at hand for short periods only in countries such as Sweden, maintenance to divorcees in England can, in theory, go on for life or until the recipient remarries.</p> <p>But even if a shorter time limit were agreed, the amounts paid would not necessarily stay the same. Sandra Davis, partner in family law at legal firm Mishcon de Reya, which acted for Princess Diana in her divorce and, initially, for Heather Mills McCartney in hers, says: 'Maintenance liabilities are ordered according to the lifestyle a spouse has become accustomed to and the breadwinner's expected income. With redundancies in the City and elsewhere at an all-time high, and the extinction of bonuses this year, divorced couples all over the country are going to have to renegotiate their divorce settlements. The consequences of this could be huge.'</p> <p>Maintenance orders covering an ex-spouse, children and school fees made through a court can all be reviewed, although the process can take a few months and must be applied for through the original court, Davis warns. A struggling ex cannot just decide to reduce their payments when times get hard.</p> <p>David Allison, partner at Family Law in Partnership, says: 'The same process is involved as when doing the original deal, including filling in financial disclosure forms, all of which costs money.'</p> <p>Many split couples who made private maintenance arrangements that were not enforced by the courts will have to work out the problem on their own. Sarah Windsor-Lewis of financial advisers Punter Southall says: 'Those already involved in a maintenance arrangement should try to keep the lines of communication open so that short-term variations can be allowed for, or a break can be arranged while the ex finds a job. If this becomes acrimonious, you may need to resort to the courts.'</p> <p>Those who make payments through the Child Support Agency can also ask for the amounts to be reassessed if they hit hard times or lose their jobs. New rules also mean that main carers on state benefits can now choose to make private maintenance arrangements with the contributing parents, if they think it would work better than seeking payments through the CSA, which was their only option previously (see page 19). If this does not work out, they can revert to an official arrangement.</p> <p>Davis says: 'Some ex-spouses might decide to cut their losses at this point and ask for a capital settlement from a redundancy payment and end the tie of the maintenance payments. Whether the former breadwinner will agree depends on what they hope to do in the future, whether they expect to get another job or will need that redundancy money to set up a business.'</p> <p>While maintenance agreements can be revisited, the renegotiation of capital settlements is only rarely allowed, if ever. Allison says: 'Redundancy is not a situation that will allow you to go back and revisit a capital deal, which is a once-and-for-all arrangement.'</p> <p>At stake in cases of capital settlements is the security of an ex-spouse who needs to use the sum to generate an income, especially in retirement - and especially if equity investments are involved. Karen Ritchie of financial adviser FPW specialises in divorce. She says: 'There are serious implications for divorcees who settled a couple of years ago and who need their funds to create an income but have seen the capital fall in value. Everyone's going to have to cut their cloth to fit, do serious cashflow planning and remodel what they have for a new world. Those hitting retirement also have to decide what to do with their lump sums and whether to buy an annuity now.'</p> <p>Even those who are still married may face difficulties. Davis says: 'When people earn a lot this tends to paste over cracks in a marriage. A spouse can see it as compensation for a difficult relationship. But when the vault closes up, both sides can view the relationship differently.'</p> <p>The property crunch has also created a new breed of cohabiting divorcees, who cannot afford to go elsewhere because the house won't sell. Allison says: 'I have just completed a collaborative case, where I told the client, who had just received her decree nisi, that she could finally open the champagne. Her reply was it didn't seem as if the divorce had really happened as her ex was still living under the same roof because they couldn't sell the family home.'</p> <p>Sometimes the income of the breadwinner rises significantly or the financial circumstances of the ex-spouse deteriorates - or both. In these circumstances, maintenance orders can also be reviewed upwards. Sarah Stevens (not her real name), divorced her husband, a broadcaster, in 2006, after he left her. Sarah, who lives in the West Country, works part-time in the media and has main custody of their two children, says: 'I am about to be made redundant and need to look for a job. </p> <p>'Living in the country is difficult and lonely for a single mum so I've decided to go back to London. Costs are very high and I'm not sure when I'll find work. Unless I find a suitable a job quickly, especially one that fits in with looking after the children, which may be hard in the current economic climate, I am going to have to ask my ex, who is on a very good salary, for higher maintenance. The amount that was originally agreed isn't enough and I struggle to make ends meet.'</p> <p>\u2022 For impartial advice on court orders for maintenance and what to do when these are no longer suitable, contact Child Maintenance Options on 0800 988 0988.

  "<p>Delight and a return to the top of the table for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a>; a thrashing for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland\">Sunderland</a> and an enforced seat in the stands for Roy Keane. This was far too easy for the home side. But while the five unanswered goals might seem to make last week's surrender of Chelsea's proud unbeaten run at home faintly unbelievable, there were hints that Luiz Felipe Scolari does need to find differing ways to beat sides who do not just roll over.</p> <p>'We played well not because we won 5-0 but because we play football,' said Chelsea's head coach, who had bemoaned a lack of such qualities during the week. 'We try to play on the ground, feet by feet, and the players change position.</p> <p>'Joe Cole, for me, played the best game [yet]. He helped when we did not have the ball and tried to build things for us - not only on the wing but inside, in midfield. This is what we need - for players to switch position.'</p> <p>Cole was indeed outstanding. But as Keane pointed out, he is just one of a side who include Deco and Frank Lampard. 'We were outclassed by a top, top team. When you're losing 5-0 and Didier Drogba comes on, you know you're in trouble. You want that clock to go forward. I was in my bedroom last night thinking of tactics and tactic boards, but nothing would have worked today - I'm not too despondent.'</p> <p>Early on, Chelsea had oozed class, but there were signs of frustration from Scolari at a lack of end product. Then came the opener. Lampard found Cole on the right. The midfielder scampered inside and shot with his left. Marton Fulop saved, but not well enough. It squeezed out from under the goalkeeper's body and pinged sideways to Alex, who had made the run into Sunderland's penalty area.</p> <p>A second goal came very quickly. And was very similar. This time it was Lampard who was on the right and in a shooting position. Instead, he slid a reverse pass that wrong-footed Sunderland and again found Alex - Nicolas Anelka grabbed the final touch for his seventh goal this season, a tally to which he would add two more by the end in collecting his first Chelsea hat-trick.</p> <p>Scolari had been counting the number of bookable fouls and conscientiously informing fourth official Andy D'Urso. By 31 minutes a flash of three palms indicated the count was now at 15 including one that did seem worth the yellow, by Steed Malbranque on Ashley Cole.</p> <p>It was late and painful enough to finish the left-back's match - 'He could miss the trip to Roma on Tuesday,' Scolari said - but as Wayne Bridge replaced him in rain now hurtling down, Chelsea had not halted scoring. Joe Cole picked out Lampard on the edge of the Sunderland area, the ball went to Florent Malouda, then Anelka, and it was 3-0 in added time.</p> <p>'You would have to ask the referee,' said Keane, when asked why he was forced to watch the second half away from the Sunderland bench after arguing with the official in the tunnel at the break. 'We certainly thought their third goal was unfair because of a foul on [Pascal] Chimbonda.' That incident was unclear, though. And the Irishman added: 'I don't want to take anything away from Chelsea - they are quality and still my favourites to edge the title.'</p> <p>All Keane got from his new position in the stands after the break was the difficult sight of his team being routed. Cole would be replaced after 63 minutes by Didier Drogba. Before this, though, he had created wonderfully for Lampard. Again the winger was allowed inside on Sunderland's right and dinked the ball up for Lampard who, with his head, scored his 100th Premier League goal.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Anelka claimed his third. Sunderland seemed incapable of retaining possession and of providing resistance. Malouda set up his countryman inside the visitors' penalty area, Anelka's finish hit Fulop, but there was enough on it to make it 5-0.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonathan Dyer, <a href=\"http://ChelseaBlog.com\"> ChelseaBlog.com</a></strong> I didn't actually feel that Sunderland played too badly, but they came up against a good team on a good day. They were solid and trying not to concede, but the first two goals knocked them and they fell apart a bit. And after Keane got sent to the stands it was all over for them. Anelka was exceptional \u2013 he's not got a reputation as a hard worker, but he was doing box\u2011to\u2011box stuff here and tackling back as well as scoring the hat-trick. Joe Cole was excellent, very difficult to play against. It's hard for anyone to contain him in a game like this. It remains to be seen whether we can marry this attractive football with winning trophies \u2013 in the Liverpool game, we couldn't open them up \u2013 but this was good stuff.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Cech 7; Bosingwa 7, Alex 8, Terry 7, <br>A Cole 7 (Bridge 7); Mikel 8; J Cole 8 (Drogba 7), Deco 7, Lampard 8, Malouda 7; Anelka 9 (Mineiro 7)</p> <p><strong>Martyn McFadden, <a href=\"http://A-Love-Supreme.com\"> A-Love-Supreme.com</a></strong><br>Where do I start? Their first three goals were really dubious \u2013 the first looked offside, the second definitely was offside because someone was standing on the line, and for the third there was a foul in the build-up. After that, it was over. I'm not sure about our formations overall \u2013 we've been playing 4-5-1 game after game yet Keane had a slightly more attacking set-up here, and it isn't really fair on Waghorn to be played as an attacker. It was a miserable day \u2013 horrible, cold and wet \u2013 but the Sunderland fans were still outsinging Chelsea's, who were probably too busy with their cappuccinos and biscuits.

  "<p>Given the expectation swirling around today's climax to a long and tense world championship, it is easy to forget that one of the contenders is a 23-year-old coming to the end of his second season in Formula One. More than that, it is the second time Lewis Hamilton has been in this position; an exceptional achievement, even by F1's lofty standards. </p> <p>That Hamilton failed spectacularly and somewhat bizarrely at the final hurdle last year has either notched up the feeling that matters will be put right today as a matter of course, or it has encouraged the belief that the Englishman will choke once more in the heat of a Brazilian afternoon. The former opinion holds sway thanks to impressive performances that have vastly outnumbered the mistakes, but the sense of anticipation overrides the reality of Hamilton's limited experience when continually playing the lead role within such a ruthless business.</p> <p>'I think the world in general forgets that,' Hamilton says. 'Even I forget that I've only been here for two years. It feels like I've been here a lot longer because I've been leading the world championship [for the majority of the past two seasons]. It's crazy. I think people wake up on a Sunday morning and see me as another competitor who they expect to see win. Partly that's because I've given that expectation. And that's how I like it. In every sport and championship, I've worked my arse off to make sure that when I get there, I'm on the money and I have to work from there and move up, rather than start lower and make my way from there.'</p> <p>From the age of eight Hamilton has won championships in every category he has entered. Yet when he arrived in F1 with McLaren-Mercedes last year, even his most ardent supporter did not expect the youngster from Stevenage to finish on the podium in his first nine races (a record) and win four times in the season.</p> <p>Suggestions that Hamilton's achievements had been inevitable thanks to the quality of his car were put into perspective by performances that occasionally humbled Fernando Alonso in the other McLaren. The twice world champion's lasting bitterness has been the visible tip of an undercurrent of dislike for a self-assured rival with a precocious talent. A poll in the Interlagos paddock this morning would probably indicate Felipe Massa as the championship contender the majority of drivers would like to see take the title. The object of their frustration is scarcely surprised.</p> <p>'It's been similar throughout my whole career,' Hamilton says. 'I get to somewhere and I do really well... It's just the way it is. It's like if you're Michael Schumacher and you have a youngster come in and beat you at his first attempt, you're not going be happy. And I'm sure that's how some people picture it. Everyone has their own opinions. I don't socialise with the other drivers. I'm not a member of the GPDA [Grand Prix Drivers' Association]. I don't hang around and play poker, so they don't really know me to comment on me. I don't particularly think they don't like me; it's just that they don't know me well enough.'</p> <p>A card school has become a popular post-practice activity among a select handful of drivers led by Force India's Giancarlo Fisichella. Even if Hamilton wished to play, he would have difficulty finding time in a schedule of media and sponsor commitments, as well as lengthy debriefs with his engineers. The rumbling animosity neither saddens him nor creates unwanted pressure.</p> <p>'I'm not particularly bothered because I've got some really good friends here, and I've got some really good friends in my life,' Hamilton says. 'We're competitors; we're not here to play in the paddock. I don't want to be hated. I like to be with people as much as I can be and I try to build relationships, but we don't have enough time to have too much fun. If I was here to try and make friendships then it would seem tough. But that's not the case. When I approach them [drivers], they shake my hand and they're very polite. The important thing is that I feel there is respect when we're on the circuit.'</p> <p>That respect was diminished in Italy in September, when Hamilton eased the Toyota of Timo Glock on to the grass, a potentially more serious tactic than the heavily publicised first-corner incident in Japan when Hamilton's over-enthusiasm and misjudgment under braking were labelled as excessively aggressive. A few drivers felt it was merely a typical first-lap incident. Either way, it prompted debate about Hamilton's apparent inability to control his rage to win at a time when being close to the championship called for circumspection, a tactic he may require today, given his seven-point advantage.</p> <p>'I do find it hard sometimes,' he says. 'It's easy for me to say, \"Right, this race I'm going to take it easy, blah, blah, blah,\" but it goes against everything in your whole body. You go there to win. But you also have to say, \"Right, there's a long race ahead. If I don't get the lead into turn one, I still have 67 laps...\" That's what I didn't think in that small period of time in Japan. </p> <p>'My first thought was to get past [having lost the lead at the start]. That's what my heart told me to do. In that second, I didn't think with my mind as much as I should have. I was angry at the time with the decision I made, but I can't fight what my heart wants because I am a racing driver and sometimes you make mistakes. </p> <p>'It looked a lot worse than it actually was, because one mistake leads to another mistake - well, not a mistake as such, but another bad situation. It looked like a complete disaster. I only made that one mistake in the race, but it led to other things going wrong.'</p> <p>That is another way of saying Hamilton found himself battling with Massa despite the Ferrari having started five places further back on the grid. When Massa made a mistake and Hamilton took advantage, the Brazilian then engaged in his share of failing to think clearly as he drove into the McLaren, spinning Hamilton to the back of the field. Despite initial reports that he felt his rival's actions had been deliberate, Hamilton harbours no hard feelings.</p> <p>'In the car, you're fierce competitors, for sure,' Hamilton says. 'Felipe is a great guy out of the car. He's always smiling and he's always having fun. His personality is very much that of a family man. He always has his dad around, just like me, so we share a lot in common. He's very competitive and he's very talented and I think this year he's showing even more just how talented he is. For his strengths, I'd say he's really an all-rounder; I wouldn't say he was more strong in qualifying or anything like this or that. He's obviously very strong at being able to put the car at the limit and extract the most out of it.'</p> <p>Hamilton and Massa received identical penalties for their various actions in Japan, although it was a curious decision by the stewards in favour of Massa over another incident later in the race that reopened the debate about officials perhaps not favouring Ferrari but picking on McLaren. Most notable has been the 25-second penalty that robbed Hamilton of the victory in Belgium that would have allowed the McLaren driver to secure the championship two weeks ago in China.</p> <p>'I've not really thought about it, to be honest,' Hamilton says. 'This is in the past. I've had a lot of penalties this year. Did I deserve them? Sometimes you do, sometimes you deserve a slap on the hand and sometimes you don't deserve it. But the stewards make the decisions and you have to deal with it. They're harsh on everyone. It does seem at times, though, that they've been a bit more harsh on us.'</p> <p>Such has been the intensity of the competition that Hamilton and Massa have made their fair share of mistakes in the preceding 17 races. Hamilton is at a loss to explain why this season has been inconsistent when compared with 2007, a year free from incidents such as driving into the back of Alonso in Bahrain, crashing into Kimi Raikkonen in the pit lane in Canada and becoming involved in controversy in France, Belgium and Japan.</p> <p>'I don't know why this is,' Hamilton says. 'I will have to sit down and analyse all those different events. I look back now and I don't live in regret, but I wish those things hadn't happened. But when they do, you become stronger; you get a knock and you bounce back. It would be lovely to go through a season without any problems. Last year, I had nine consecutive races with no problems and it would be fantastic to have that again. But these things happen for a reason and you just have to deal with it.</p> <p>'This year, I think I've done a good job. I set very high goals for myself, so I feel I've made too many mistakes. Some things have forced that and there is nothing I can do about it. I just have to move forward.</p> <p>'I've been leading the world championship and that's no easy thing. But it's no coincidence. I've not had any races given to me; I've worked for every single one of them. So I have to be proud in that sense. Also, I have a team that supports me every step of the way; there's not one guy or girl in my team who's not putting in 100 per cent. They all do a fantastic job. Now it's my turn to do my bit.'</p>",
  "<p>With the Bank of England declaring that the Western banking system is in its most acute crisis since 1914, John Maynard Keynes is back. Alistair Darling is the first Chancellor since Roy Jenkins to speak warmly of the 20th-century's greatest economist. Newspaper and television profiles mushroom. This is the man who said that countries must spend their way out of recessions, you will read, by allowing public borrowing to rocket. Keynes is allegedly the original big-spending, big government liberal. And along the way, you will have learnt that his ballerina wife, Lydia Lopokova, had to cross-dress because he never relinquished his taste for beautiful young men. That we need a little Keynesianism - a dodgy doctrine from a gay libertine - is a sign of how desperate the economic situation has become. </p> <p>For a convinced Keynesian such as myself, it is a depressing caricature of what remains the most subtle and best explanation of why market economies work as inefficiently as they do. Worse, it may lead not only to some costly policy mistakes, but it will mean that a once in a generation chance to reform the British and world financial system will be missed. The time has come to assert the real Keynes.</p> <p>This is a Keynesian moment because an out-of-control financial system has created a potential slump that can only be solved by the close but generous reform of finance. For Keynes, the interaction of the financial system with the real economy is capitalism's existential problem. Banks are where our savings reside without any promissory note about when we intend to spend them, so that the spectre permanently hovers over the economy of there either being too little spending or too much. The job of finance is to recycle those savings back into investment and so sustain overall levels of demand, production and employment at a balanced rate.</p> <p>Free-market economists maintain that free decisions in free financial markets will propel the rate of interest to take the entire weight of this existential task. Keynes disputed this to the depths of his being. Financial markets were different from the real economy, he proved, and operated on very different, short-term time horizons and impulsive passions. If farming were to be organised like the stock market, he once wrote, a farmer would sell his farm in the morning when it was raining, only to buy it back in the afternoon when the sun came out. </p> <p>This is a ludicrous way to approach any economic activity, but it is how the stock market values companies. Financial markets are always more transactional, more short term and move faster than anyone in the real economy could ever contemplate.</p> <p>Moreover, they are prone to wild enthusiasm and pessimism. Human beings do not know the future. We may try to attach rational probabilities to certain outcomes, but that is not the point; there are, Keynes said, prefiguring Donald Rumsfeld, unknown unknowns. An unknowable future creates herd effects, waves of irrational exuberance or gloom. We doubt our individual capacity to figure out what lies ahead, so we surrender to the greater wisdom of crowds. </p> <p>Because financial markets permit many more fast, transactional, short-term decisions than any other, they swing faster with the crowd than any other part of the economy. Alternating between asset price bubbles and hoarding of cash is in their DNA. And free-market economists' attempts to prove otherwise, along the way serving the interests of a financial plutocracy, are just wrong. </p> <p>Thus, credit flows and the prices of financial assets must be constantly monitored to see if they are behaving rationally. Intervention in the financial markets - regulatory, institutional, via monetary policy and in collaboration with other governments - is vital. The socialisation of the financial system may, paradoxically, be an imperative to save capitalism. Contra-cyclical government borrowing in recessions may be helpful. But the big game is to do everything you can to stimulate private sector credit flows. </p> <p>Keynes would be completely unsurprised by today's events; he would have spent the previous decade warning of the existential danger posed by the mania for financial deregulation. The Bank of England revealed in its financial stability review last week that in the seven years up to 2008 British banks had lent \u00a3700bn more to their customers than they had saved, making up the difference from taking deposits from abroad via the now dead markets in securitised assets insured by credit default swaps. If the banks try to restore just half of the gap over 12 months by returning to the ratios in 2003, the Bank of England shows that they would have to cut lending by a depression-inducing 5 per cent. Even doing it over three years implies that lending growth will fall by two-thirds - a prolonged recession.</p> <p>How much feasibly can Chancellor Darling offset this by increasing government borrowing over and above the operation of the automatic stabilisers during a recession - tax revenues falling and social security spending rising? To increase government borrowing by an additional 2 per cent of GDP - some \u00a330bn - is the most which is practically possible. It would be helpful, but unless we stop the banks closing the funding gap we are sunk. Which is why Keynesians focus on monetary policy and the financial system as the principal swing factors at moments such as this. The Bank of England must cut interest rates from 4.5 per cent to 3.0 per cent next week as a minimum. Moreover, the government has to devise mechanisms to persuade the banks they can safely lend and reduce that funding gap slowly. </p> <p>Most important is the introduction of schemes that insure the nominal value of loans, such as James Crosby's proposal to create a government insurance scheme for raising funds for mortgages. We need similar schemes for small firms' working capital requirements and larger firms' investment needs. I would create lending organisations as Roosevelt did in the 1930s. In the longer term, we need to develop a new insurance infrastructure to help banks - and borrowers - better manage risk. None of this will be delivered by market forces. Everything will have to be created by government.</p> <p>For everybody, there is an event or book that changed their life. Mine was reading Axel Leijonhufvud's great exposition - On Keynesian Economics and the Economics of Keynes - 20 years ago. I had worked in the City and had experienced its dysfunctional short termism and wild fevers at first hand. Keynes was the economist who put it all together, the liberal who understood why free finance is capitalism's greatest enemy. </p> <p>The State We're In was my attempt to devise a Keynesianism for our own times. I will stand by the heart of the book - deregulate financial markets and create a financial system that dominates business at your peril - to my last. But there was no constituency for reform 10 years ago. Keynesians of my ilk were seen as irrelevant and wrong. </p> <p>But now, with Keynes back in fashion, if we don't do Keynesianism right, we risk a very nasty recession indeed. The Chancellor used his Mais lecture last week to argue for a welcome pragmatism on fiscal policy and urged the Bank of England to do the same on monetary policy. He won't get far, though, unless he can directly change the banks' lending policies. We need him to become the complete Keynesian. There are only weeks left before the downward vortex becomes irretrievably deep. Read Leijonhufvud. And act.</p>",
  "<p>The 21st century began late for America, on 11 September 2001. Before that day, the US still defined its role in the world with reference to ideological triumph in the Cold War that had dominated the century just passed. It was the planet's only superpower and saw itself as a popular champion of global democracy. Few expected the nation to come under attack, least of all the man who had been installed in the White House a year earlier. In 2000, George W Bush was uninterested in foreign affairs. He was ill-equipped to be the first US President of the new millennium. </p> <p>Mr Bush found moral purpose in response to terrorism, modelling his response on Cold War rhetoric as a battle between good and evil. But he will leave office unable to claim victory. Meanwhile, foreign entanglements led him to neglect economic and social policy. He inherited a budget surplus of $236bn, which was spent on defence and tax cuts for the rich, leaving a deficit of nearly $500bn as the country enters a recession. It is a sad legacy after two terms in office.</p> <p>So it is no surprise that opinion polls show voters ready to punish the Republican party. Even if John McCain pulls off a surprise victory, beating Barack Obama to the White House, he will have to govern in deference to a Democratic Congress. </p> <p>For the Senator John McCain of 2007, that would not be a problem. He had a reputation for pragmatic bipartisanship and principled opposition to the excesses of the Bush administration. He sponsored campaign finance reform; he decried state-sanctioned torture; he backed measures to halt climate change; he opposed unaffordable tax cuts. At the start of the campaign, Democrats feared Mr McCain would woo voters in the centre ground, while conservatives feared he would betray their agenda of moral activism against abortion, gun control and gay marriage.</p> <p>Neither fear was justified. The John McCain of 2008 has abandoned the centre. There have been rightward shifts on climate change and tax, but the change is mostly a matter of tone. Mr McCain has tried to portray Barack Obama as an unpatriotic socialist. But most extraordinary was the selection of Sarah Palin as a running mate. That was an attempt to position Mr McCain as a tribune in the Culture War between secular liberals and religious conservatives that has paralysed US politics for generations. Sarah Palin represents a strand in Republican thinking that sees the party's mission as perpetual insurgency against an un-American conspiracy run by a cosmopolitan Washington elite. </p> <p>But the job of a Vice-President is to stand in should the Commander-in-Chief be unable to serve. Ms Palin has disqualified herself from that responsibility by showing a woeful grasp of policy. By promoting her, Mr McCain brought his judgment into question. He also made himself a candidate of old divisions, against Mr Obama's promise of unity and change.</p> <p>The long campaign has tested the characters of both candidates, especially when global economic crisis forced them to abandon prepared scripts and perform by instinct. Barack Obama won that contest easily. His policy prescriptions, essentially a redistributive tax agenda, were fairer and more responsible than Mr McCain's panicky pledge of tax-cuts. In style, Mr McCain's reaction was slow and choleric, while Mr Obama's was steely and swift. The Democratic candidate thus refuted what had been the strongest argument against his candidacy - that he lacked leadership stature.</p> <p>That makes for a marked contrast with the diminished and discredited White House incumbent. George W Bush's reign is now recognised, even by non-partisan American commentators, as a colossal failure. He spent two terms misapplying the old foreign policy doctrines of the Cold War to a new security threat and exploiting the old enmities of the Culture Wars to shore up his power.</p> <p>Mr Bush failed the test that history set him: to lead America into the new millennium. America is still waiting for a 21st-century President. It has one ready to serve in Barack Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Keith Andrews scored his first goal for 10-man Blackburn two minutes from time, to salvage a point at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom\">West Brom</a>. Andrews drilled a low 20-yard shot past Scott Carson to deny the home side, who had themselves come from behind.</p> <p>Benni McCarthy had put <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blackburn\">Blackburn</a> ahead from the penalty spot before being sent off for two bookable offences. Goals from Roman Bednar and Ishmael Miller then looked to have sealed victory for Albion before Andrews' late strike.</p> <p>The Blackburn manager Paul Ince was less than impressed with referee Mike Jones. 'The sending-off ruined the game,' Ince said. 'After the penalty for us, the referee gave West Brom everything.</p> <p>'The tackle from Benni for the first offence, there was no malice in it. The second one, the ball has hit the top of his shoulder. The referee couldn't wait to get the card out. It was harsh and ruined the game. Give red cards for dangerous and malicious tackles where the studs are up, fair enough. It is not a game for women.'</p> <p>Blackburn went ahead through a 13th-minute penalty needlessly conceded by Ryan Donk. There appeared little danger, but the Dutch defender tugged at the shirt of Jason Roberts and Jones instantly pointed to the spot. Up stepped McCarthy and the power of his shot ensured it nestled in a corner of the net even though Scott Carson dived the right way.</p> <p>The West Brom manager Tony Mowbray was just as unimpressed with this decision by the referee. 'The cameras might show there is a pull or a tug, but you don't give penalties for things like that in football. Refs do not give decisions like that. It bewildered me,' he said.</p> <p>McCarthy was booked after 19 minutes for bringing down Jonathan Greening and 17 minutes later he handled a clearance from Jonas Olsson near the halfway line and was shown his second yellow card. The home side then had a player booked, when Donk returned to the action without permission after receiving treatment on the touchline.</p> <p>Ince made a half-time substitution, taking off Danny Simpson and replacing him with Tugay, which led to Brett Emerton dropping to right-back.</p> <p>Albion looked to make their numerical advantage count and Miller was first to react to a near-post corner from Greening, but directed his header off target. Paul Robinson did well to beat out a 25-yard drive by Robert Koren, but Rovers were under the cosh and after 55 minutes Bednar was played in by Miller on the edge of the area and brought Albion level.</p> <p>Then Blackburn seemed powerless to stop the attacks on their goal and after 62 minutes a superb Miller strike put West Brom ahead. Ince took off Martin Olsson and replaced him with Morten Gamst Pedersen. With seconds left, Andrews spoiled the home party, firing a rasping shot past Carson.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Terry Wills, Baggies@yahoogroups.com</strong> A quarter of the season played and we're facing a huge task to stay in the Premier League. This was a game that could and should have been won. Against 10 men we pulled a goal back then went in front with a tremendous goal from Miller and looked comfortable. A third goal would've clinched it, but nerves kicked in. We played too much 'pretty football', gave the ball away too often and paid when they poached a last-minute equaliser. Teams will be looking for a striker when the January transfer window opens, but by then we'll probably be in the bottom three.

Having been booked, Benni was treading a fine line with a fusspot referee and to do what he did was suicide for the team. But our 10-man side held their own. Emerton was outstanding, showing the form that attracted the club to him five years ago. Jason Roberts was a lone striker and didn't provide an outlet for the midfield.

  "<p>The next few weeks will be critical for the survival of devolution in Northern Ireland, First Minister Peter Robinson warned yesterday.</p> <p>With the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein still involved in confidential talks about restoring the power-sharing Executive at Stormont, the DUP leader told his annual conference that the Cabinet would have to meet to salvage the Province's economy.</p> <p>Speaking at the DUP's conference in Armagh, Robinson said: 'In a few weeks' time I hope that we will be able to bring a package of measures to the Executive and Assembly to get through the present difficulties and to build for the future. We must alleviate short-term hardship, boost our construction industry and ensure we keep our employment levels.</p> <p>'I have no doubt that how this Executive deals with the present economic crisis will be the yardstick by how devolution as a whole will be judged.'</p> <p>The Executive has not met since June this year because Sinn Fein refuses to sit in Cabinet. Sinn Fein wants a firm date for the implementation of the final phase of devolution - the transfer of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p> <p>Officially the DUP refuses to comment on reports of fresh negotiations with Sinn Fein but it is understood talks, which only ended in the early hours of Friday morning, were focused on finding a compromise over policing and justice. </p> <p>The DUP's annual conference was held on the eve of a controversial homecoming parade in Belfast for local soldiers in British Army regiments. Dissident republicans have told The Observer they plan to disrupt today's rally, despite calls from Gerry Adams for 'troublemakers' to stay away. </p> <p>Dissident republican sources said they rejected pleas on Friday night from community groups closely linked to Sinn Fein to re-route their protest rallies. Two organisations - Eirigi and the Irish Republican Socialist Party - are holding separate demonstrations today against the army march. </p> <p>There will be a huge security operation around Belfast city centre this morning to cope with the thousands expected at the homecoming rally. Among the crowds cheering on the returning troops will be several hundred loyalists. The Observer has learnt that both the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association has ordered all its members to attend the march. There are fears among the security forces of clashes breaking out between the loyalist and the dissident republican demonstrators. </p> <p>It follows a series of bomb alerts yesterday afternoon in Larne and Glenavy near Lisburn.

  "<p>Baron Levene of Portsoken's 45-year career has been a procession of glittering achievements. The son of an antique dealer from north-west London, Peter Levene has been adviser to one Prime Minister and a number of senior government figures. And such is his unalloyed reputation among City grandees that the 66-year-old Chelsea fan became Lord Mayor of London in 1998.</p> <p>Since 2000 he has chaired Lloyd's of London - the most important job in the insurance industry. By rights, he should now be retiring after nearly completing two terms at Lloyd's, but legislation is currently going through parliament to allow him to extend his tenure.</p> <p>This weekend, however, Levene's burnished reputation has been called into question by a growing coalition of senior politicians spanning the political divide. They argue that Levene is in the unfortunate position of being one of the most important Western business figures enabling the repressive Burmese military dictatorship to cling on to power. </p> <p>Levene has long faced criticism at Lloyd's for failing to rebuke those of its syndicates that share the reinsurance risk on key aviation and shipping interests owned by the junta. The insurance in effect means Burma can trade with the outside world. The Foreign Office took the unusual step last month of writing to Levene reminding him of the UK government's official position of discouraging business with the country. </p> <p>But Levene is also a director at Total, the French energy giant that has signed agreements with Burma to extract gas and oil there - agreements thought to benefit the Burmese generals to the tune of $2.66m each day. </p> <p>Levene's two roles means he is a leading force within the two most important Western firms doing business in Burma; this despite calls from the pro-democracy movement for all foreign businesses to cease trading with the regime.</p> <p>John Bercow, the Conservative MP who is chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for democracy in Burma, said: 'By its massive investment in Burma, Total props up one of the most barbaric dictatorships in the world and this is to its eternal discredit. It is therefore a great sadness that Lord Levene, a businessman of distinction who could doubtless have his pick of commercial opportunities, has sullied himself by becoming a director of this company.'</p> <p>Labour MEP Glenys Kinnock called on Levene to resign from Total. She says: 'If he searches his conscience he must conclude that he should discontinue his position with the company or use his position to secure Total's withdrawal from a country currently ruled by evil. This revelation again confirms that businesses are continuing to put profit before people and proves the need for targeted EU sanctions, which we in the European parliament have consistently demanded.'</p> <p>In a terse statement, Levene said he was not considering resigning from Total, where earlier this year he was reappointed for another three-year term. He stated that his directorship at Total did not 'sully' his reputation or affect his views on issuing guidance to Lloyd's managing agents and brokers dealing with Burma. And he rejected the argument that revenues from oil and gas, as well as Lloyd's reinsurance of key infrastructure owned by the Burmese junta, help it retain power. 'There is no evidence to support this,' he said. He refused to discuss whether Lloyd's had any insurance business with Total.</p> <p>But, speaking to The Observer, Maung Maung, the Burmese union leader regarded as the likely Prime Minister if the south east Asian nation overthrows military rule, warned that Lloyd's could eventually be prosecuted for possible complicity in human rights abuses associated with the brutal regime. 'Lord Levene should advise Lloyd's to stop all Burma's insurance being marketed with and at Lloyd's... Lord Levene should also note and inform Lloyd's that cases on crimes against humanities are being built up to be applied at the International Criminal Court as well as some countries that practise international jurisdiction.'</p> <p>Lloyd's insiders say the drive to impose sanctions against Burma, supported by detained pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is not supported by all campaign groups and that some Europeans believe engagement with the country helps the people of Burma.</p> <p>But Johnny Chatterton, campaign director at Burma Campaign UK, said this was a minority view argued by those with business interests there. 'This link poses yet more awkward questions for Lloyd's,' Chatterton says. 'Does Total insure its Burma operations through Lloyd's? Was Levene present when Total's board discussed Burma? The reputation of the entire Lloyd's market has been dragged through the mud by being associated with Burma's murderous dictatorship. Lloyd's must clean up their act now or they will be associated with Burma in the same way that Barclays was with apartheid South Africa.'</p> <p>The Burmese people have endured a horrific year as the violent repression of an uprising led by Buddhist monks was followed by Cyclone Nargis, which is thought to have claimed well over 100,000 lives. While Levene, Total and Lloyd's continue to profit from doing business with Burma, they must hope that its people have short memories when and if democracy is restored.</p>",
  "<p>Major changes at the Child Support Agency (CSA) that could affect more than four million adults and children have come into force.</p> <p>Parents on benefits who are the main carers for their children will be given greater freedom through a more generous system, and the ability to bypass the CSA if they want to make their own maintenance agreements with their former partners.</p> <p>These changes are part of a package of measures aimed at turning around the fortunes of the notoriously unsuccessful agency, which is to be gradually supplanted by a new body, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (CMEC); CMEC took control of the child maintenance system yesterday. </p> <p>From April next year, more reforms will be introduced to force the absent father or mother (known as the 'non-resident parent' or 'NRP') to pay the maintenance due from them. It will become easier to take money directly from their bank accounts, or send in bailiffs, for instance.</p> <p>Many parents with custody of their children (known as 'parents with care' or 'PWCs') have benefited from an immediate financial boost: the amount of maintenance income they can receive without affecting their benefits entitlement has just risen from \u00a310 to \u00a320 a week. The charity One Parent Families/Gingerbread has been pushing for maintenance payments to be disregarded entirely when calculating benefit entitlements - and, thanks in part to Gordon Brown's commitments to eliminate child poverty by 2020, this is due to happen from April 2010. </p> <p>However, parents receiving maintenance need to be careful to notify JobCentre Plus about how much they get. 'They are responsible for reporting changes in their income as this can affect their benefits,' says a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions. 'Delaying reporting can either lead to them missing out on money they should be getting, or lead to an overpayment which we may recover.' </p> <p>Previously, when the CSA received maintenance payments from the non-resident parent, it deducted any sums that were due to the Department for Work and Pensions (if the maintenance income came to more than the current \u00a310 threshold) and passed on the net amount. Now, the full sum goes straight to the parent with care, who is therefore given the responsibility of informing and settling up with the Department for Work and Pensions, via JobCentre Plus.</p> <p>The other big reform implemented last week is one that many PWCs on benefits will have to think long and hard about. Deciding whether to make your own maintenance agreement with your ex-partner, without the intervention of the CSA, is far more complicated than it sounds. 'Helping more parents understand each other sounds a really good idea,' says Janet Allbeson of One Parent Families. 'But when couples are splitting up, it can be very hard to get parents to agree to terms that are fair.' </p> <p>The most obvious drawback about taking the DIY route is that the CSA will not enforce these agreements if the non-resident parent stops paying or pays less than agreed. </p> <p>Previously, parents were able to make their own settlements, but only if the parent with care was not on benefits. These agreements can work well if both parties are reliable, but even well-off ex-couples can start disagreeing quite quickly when their circumstances change. </p> <p>Events such as the parent with care getting a new partner, or non-resident parents having a child with someone else, are the sort of things that frequently encourage the non-resident parent to try to pay less. People best suited to making their own settlements are those who retain some kind of rapport and an ability to compromise. They can barter and pay each other in kind - funding the child's education, perhaps, or footing the bill for a holiday - rather than sticking to the narrow financial settlement that the CSA would devise. </p> <p>One Parent Families would not recommend the DIY approach to parents with care who think the other parent is likely to be unreliable. 'If you think there is a risk of irregular payments, use the agency,' says Allbeson. 'The agency is also helpful if someone does not know where their ex-partner is [because it may be able to trace them].' </p> <p>For those considering doing their own agreements, there is a fair amount of advice and help. See the CSA's new website, <a href=\"http://www.cmoptions.org/\">cmoptions.org</a>, or call its helpline on 0800 988 0988. There is a maintenance calculator on this website, which would be a useful starting point. </p> <p>The CSA site also includes a 'private agreement' form that can be used by parents to record their settlement. See also the One Parent Families website (<a href=\"http://www.oneparentfamilies.org.uk/\">oneparentfamilies.org.uk</a>) or call its helpline on 0800 018 5026.</p>",
  "<p>Following an Observer investigation, the Ministry of Justice is advising individuals to be wary of spurious promises by claims management firms who say they can recover 'overpaid' bank and credit card charges. </p> <p>Observer investigation, the Ministry of Justice is advising individuals to be wary of spurious promises by claims management firms who say they can recover 'overpaid' bank and credit card charges. </p> <p>Dr Anna Radomska received an unsolicited call on her mobile phone by a salesman from a company called UPI Ltd. 'The guy said there was a new law which said that my bank had been cheating me on the overdraft interest,' she said. 'He said he could help me get my money back. So I said \"all right\".</p> <p>'Then he started reading something to me which I didn't really take in. Then he said he knew what my debit card number was but wanted me to confirm it. He told me what the first eight digits were and I had to tell him the others.' Because he apparently had her card details, she believed he was a representative of the bank. In fact, the first eight digits usually denote just the bank and branch and he did not know any more of the number. She did not realise that she had just 'bought' the DIY claims kit that UPI sells.</p> <p>'The next day I saw on my account statement that I had been charged \u00a359.99.' She called the salesman. 'He claimed he said they were going to charge me. I don't recall him doing that and I'm usually very careful. Maybe he did, but he was speaking very fast from a script so I could have missed it. I asked if I could recall the transaction and he said yes, if I sent the [kit] back.'</p> <p>UPI's website offers to help you reclaim bank, credit card and payment protection insurance charges, claiming: 'Have you ever been charged for going overdrawn? Had bounced cheques or direct debits returned? ... Then you will have been charged an unlawful amount by your bank.' Later on it claims that banks are 'not allowed to do this'. In fact, banks are allowed to make charges in these circumstances; the case going through the courts is to decide whether the size of such charges is unfair. </p> <p>After being contacted by The Observer, Kevin Rousell, the head of the department in the Ministry of Justice that regulates claims management firms, ordered an investigation. He said: 'In many instances banks have been found to have unfair charges, but it is not true to say it always happens and people should be wary of such claims.'</p> <p>Clive Price, spokesman for UPI, stood by the claim that everyone who had been charged an overdraft fee had been charged an illegal amount. When pressed, he said that the statement just referred to 'the average man in the street', and in his opinion they had been overcharged. When it was pointed out that the courts had not yet fully ruled on the issue, he said: 'That's why it says \"unlawful\".' He stated that in this case the word 'unlawful' only meant that the legality had not yet been decided. 'Until it's been decided, it's just an opinion. I believe the wording is correct,' he said.</p> <p>Following the investigation, UPI revealed that the salesman, who worked for a call centre on behalf of UPI, only knew the first eight digits of Dr Radomska's card. Her details had been passed on by the firm who provided her mobile phone insurance - possibly in contravention of the Data Protection Act, although UPI may not have been aware of that. The MoJ has directed UPI to cease suggesting it has individuals' card details and to drop misleading claims from its website. UPI has now refunded Dr Radomska's payment.</p>",
  "<h2>Mole with a hole</h2> <p>Four years after his last appearence, Sue Townsend's fictional diarist is to get yet another outing - his eighth - this month in The Lost Diaries of Adrian Mole, 1999-2001 (Michael Joseph). In a foreword, Mole explains that the diaries were 'lost' after being seized by police under anti-terrorist legislation in 2001 and have only just been returned to him. Things then get all metafictional as Mole writes that a 'fraudster' called Sue Townsend has made a 'lucrative living passing herself off as me'. Mole's real problems are more straightforward, though: the adult Mole just isn't half as funny as he was as a teenager.</p> <h2>A costly leather fetish </h2> <p>The agreement between Google and US publishers to give unprecedented access to books online has set the literary world buzzing with the prospect of a revolution that will transform publishing as profoundly as iTunes did the music industry. But though the future of literature might not involve the book, the Browser is delighted to see that some stalwarts remain dedicated to serving the old-fashioned paper fetishist. Wisely betting that 'the continuing demand for printed books' will 'depend on physical appeal', White's Books is offering a series of four appealingly cloth-clad classics, while Penguin has found yet another way of repackaging its back catalogue by binding a set of six in leather, albeit for a not very credit crunch-friendly \u00a350 apiece.</p> <h2>Browned off at Random </h2> <p>Bad news from New York last week as the credit crunch struck publishing, with 10 per cent of Doubleday staff laid off.

  "<p>Tens of thousands of pupils are being excluded from school for drinking, according to new research which undermines the government's claims that its efforts to curb alcohol-related antisocial behaviour are working.</p> <p>The research, based on an analysis of figures from government departments, also raises doubts about whether shops and bars are doing enough to clamp down on underage drinking. In 2006, the most recent year for which figures are available, more than 500,000 under-18s were served alcohol in bars and more than 350,000 bought alcohol in shops.</p> <p>The figures also suggest there may be a close link between underage drinking and crime: half of all 10-17s who drank once a week or more (350,000) are said to have committed a criminal offence.</p> <p>'The government's failure to tackle the binge-drinking culture in this country is having a horrendous impact on a whole generation of young people,' said Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who obtained the figures. 'Many children are simply slipping through the safety net and are in grave danger of being condemned to a future of addiction and criminality.' </p> <p>According to an analysis of school exclusions placed in the parliamentary library over the summer recess by the Department for Schools, Children and Families, 2,000 pupils were permanently excluded and 40,000 temporarily excluded for drug and alcohol-related incidents during the past four years.</p> <p>The government has introduced a number of initiatives to curb underage alcohol sales, including Challenge 21, which encourages pubs and off-licences to check IDs. Police from 39 forces in England and Wales seized 20,945 litres (44,265 pints) of alcoholic drinks during a half-term clampdown on public drinking in February. </p> <p>But Clegg insisted that more needed to be done. 'Ministers must end the culture of impunity for those selling alcohol to children,' he said. 'The message should be simple - those who can't sell alcohol responsibly won't be allowed to sell it at all.'</p> <p>The Lib Dems based their analysis on previously unreleased figures used to compile the Offending, Crime and Justice Survey for 2006. The figures show that more than half of 10 to 17-year-olds reported having an alcoholic drink at least once in the previous 12 months. Almost half of those who had drunk alcohol in the past year obtained it from their parents. </p> <p>'We need to confront this problem now by providing the support parents need to show their children how to drink alcohol responsibly in the home,' Clegg declared.</p> <p>Research also suggests that underage drinkers are turning to new ways to obtain alcohol. In 2004 a government survey found that 49 per cent of children aged 16 and 17 who drank alcohol got it from bars, with 39 per cent getting friends to buy it for them. But by 2006, 45 per cent said they obtained alcohol from friends who had bought it for them, while a much lower proportion bought it themselves in bars. </p> <p>Nearly half - 47 per cent - of 10 to 17-year-olds who drank alcohol every week confessed to committing a crime, although parliamentary statisticians say it is not clear whether this implies a clear link between drinking and offending.</p>",
  "<h2>The brief</h2> <p><strong>Fleur Grenier and Roy Newnham live in Littlehampton, West Sussex. </strong></p> <p><strong>'We're getting married in early February and are keen for a week in the sun. Our budget is about \u00a31,000 (excluding spending money) but we don't want to go for Cyprus and the Canaries - because Roy has worked there and wants to go somewhere new. I'd love to get to somewhere like the Caribbean, but could we afford it? I'm a pewtersmith and make the majority of my income at Christmas fairs. Will we get a cheaper deal if we wait till the New Year?'</strong></p> <p>There are ways to make honeymoons cheaper. 'Stick close to home,' says Jill Nash, author of Honeymoons in Style. 'Pick a destination that has a low-cost airline or that you can reach by train and search out accommodation on the internet. Cheaper travel will mean that you can spend more on a nice hotel.' Try to avoid travelling in half term (from 6-18 February) and if you can leave a few days between the wedding and the honeymoon finding a bargain will be easier - flights leaving mid-week tend to be cheaper than those at the weekend. Some people dislike all-inclusive resorts on principle, since they tend to deprive local bars and restaurants of tourist trade, but they can help make a destination more affordable. Charter flights can bring countries such as India within reach.</p> <p>Now to the question of winter sun. In February, Tunisia and Morocco should have daytime temperatures of around 20C. The evenings will still be cold but while you might encounter a little rain, you should see plenty of sun. The Red Sea offers scuba diving and snorkelling and, if you stay around Hurghada, Luxor and the Valley of the Kings is a day-trip away. Daytime temperatures should be a couple of degrees higher than Marrakesh though nights can still be cool. </p> <p>For serious winter sun you need to head further afield to India and Mexico. Sarah Anderson, of Thomas Cook, says: 'Kerala is a wonderful destination with temperatures of around 29C in February. It offers great value for money and is a good alternative to Goa. Seven nights' B&amp;B, including flights, at the three-star Uday Samudra Hotel in Kovalam is on special offer at \u00a3498 per person, down from \u00a3649. Because a honeymoon is a fixed date we recommend booking as early as possible.' </p> <p>To book now, or not? Your decision about this depends on how important the honeymoon is to you. These days, most couples will have holidayed together before the wedding. A honeymoon has more symbolism than the average holiday, but - arguably - not much more. If you like the look of a particular hotel and you find a good deal, book now - there's no guarantee that the same holiday will be available after the New Year. If it's the destination that appeals and it has plenty of hotels and flights from different carriers, then you might want to gamble by waiting, although Paul Nelson of <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">lastminute.com</a> advises that its best to secure flights, but leave booking the hotel until later. 'If you leave it till the last minute,' he says, 'flights are often more difficult to find than accommodation.' </p> <p>Certain destinations tend to become more expensive the later you try to book them. The Caribbean is one of these. From 17 December, a new charter airline from Monarch will launch flights to Tobago and Grenada which may result in some good deals in the New Year. Currently flights in February are \u00a3466. One last thing, it's always worth telling the travel agent, tour operator or hotel that it's your honeymoon. Most hotels try to make honeymooners happy with fruit, sparkling wine - and room upgrades.</p> <h2>The insiders' tips</h2> <p><strong>Matthew Fisher, Real Holidays</strong></p> <p>The twelve-hour flight time means I wouldn't normally suggest Goa for a week, but if they can cope with the journey it's an ideal choice - great beaches, bustling markets, really relaxing. I suggest the quiet beaches of the south, where you can walk for miles without seeing anybody. Jewel in the Crown is offering a week at the traditional Failaka Guesthouse from \u00a3570, including flights, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation in February, but if they risk booking late, or are prepared to fly from Manchester, they may get this under the \u00a3500 per person guideline. </p> <p>They could also consider Gambia, a six-hour flight from the UK, with friendly people, sandy beaches and exotic culture. Late deals from The Gambia Experience include a week's B&amp;B at the Kombo Beach hotel from \u00a3469 including flights and transfers.</p> <p>A final suggestion would be Egypt. In February it should be positively balmy, but I would advise shunning the traditional Sharm package to head for the luxurious Movenpick El Quseir resort south of Hurghada. Set in a beautiful bay with its own beach, and just a short walk from the town itself, packages to this hotel are usually over \u00a3600 in February but with a bit of creative thinking we should be able to get this within budget. At the moment the hotel is offering complimentary transfers and with a standard room starting at \u00a3475 per week, B&amp;B, there is enough left over to book an Easyjet flight to Hurghada. They would have to move fast, as the later they leave it the more expensive flights will be but, by being further south, they get warmer temperatures, fewer tourists and a visit to Luxor is achievable in a day.</p> <p>\u2022 Real Holidays 020 7359 3938; <a href=\"http://www.realholidays.co.uk\">realholidays.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Amanda Statham, travel editor, You &amp; Your Wedding magazine</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't recommend holding out for a New-Year bargain. While you may be lucky and pay two-star prices for a five-star getaway, you risk ending up with a mediocre package or, worse still, not able to book anywhere. Luckily, there are some fantastic deals around at the moment, which won't break the bank. </p> <p>The Caribbean is very pricey in February as it is peak time. However the Mexican Riviera (which shares the same sea as the Caribbean islands and also has fabulous golden beaches) is a more realistic option. First Choice (<a href=\"http://www.firstchoice.co.uk/mexico\">firstchoice.co.uk/mexico</a>) is offering seven nights at the small and friendly Caribbean Princess resort early next year from \u00a3589 per person, including flights. It's all-inclusive, so although it's \u00a3178 over budget, your extra expenditure on food and drink will be zero as you'll have paid it all up front. There's loads to do, from scuba diving to visiting local craft markets. </p> <p>Closer to home, I'd recommend Morocco as a fantastic destination. It's exotic, has a great year-round climate and accommodation is seriously romantic. Kick off in Marrakesh, where you'll appreciate the souks full of intricate jewellery and beautiful ironworks. The riads (converted townhouses built around an inner courtyard) are knockout and a real bargain. Check out Riad Jonan (<a href=\"http://www.riadjonan.com\">riadjonan.com</a>) from \u00a355 per room, per night, furnished with hand-carved furniture and tiles, tucked away in the atmospheric Medina. After a few days exploring, head to Essaouira, where you can lie by the pool at hotels such as Atlas Essaouira (<a href=\"http://www.hipmorocco.com\">hipmorocco.com</a>) from \u00a370 per room, per night. No need to worry about flights pushing you over budget; Easyjet (<a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">easyjet.com</a>) flies to Marrakesh.</p>",

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland will this week own up to more multi-billion-pound write-offs and announce a major overhaul of its strategy, as Chancellor Alistair Darling explains how he plans to keep all the bailed-out banks in check.</p> <p>Analysts expect RBS to take another hit of \u00a33bn on complex financial instruments, adding to \u00a35.9bn in the first half of the year. Broker Panmure forecasts it will lose \u00a36.8bn on write-downs and impairments in the second half, including losses on traditional bank lending as well as structured credit.</p> <p>Details of RBS's financial health will emerge when it unveils the prospectus for a \u00a320bn capital boost, as part of the government's rescue package for the banking sector. The bank faces criticism over plans to pay bonuses to investment bankers below board level, it emerged this weekend.</p> <p>At the same time, the Chancellor will announce the creation of a new arm's-length agency to manage the government's \u00a337bn stakes in the banks. Its staff will closely monitor their lending activities, to ensure they fulfil promises to keep up the supply of credit to small businesses, and give mortgage borrowers a fair deal. If there is evidence of banks ramping profit margins, or failing to pass on cheaper funding costs, their boards can expect a dressing down.</p> <p>At RBS, new boss Stephen Hester will use the prospectus launch to set out his future strategy. It will involve stripping out risk, unravelling the expansion into the US and Asia of his predecessor, Sir Fred Goodwin, and beefing up the basic retail and corporate banking business. He is putting toxic assets into a 'sin bin', to be run off or sold, and staff fear large-scale job losses. Hester may also try to sell off trophy assets, such as private bank Coutts.</p>",
  "<p>Yes, that really is Brad Pitt - playing a man 'born under unusual circumstances' in the Deep South at the end of the First World War. This may be the strangest journey an actor has ever embarked upon: Pitt's character, Benjamin Button, is fated to live his life in reverse. As a baby, he has the appearance of an 85-year-old man, albeit in miniature, and as he grows in size, he begins to look and act younger. Pitt plays Button from finish to start, aided by some impressive prosthetics and effects.</p> <p>Early buzz and a handsome-looking trailer suggest that the movie, based on a short story by F Scott Fitzgerald and directed by David Fincher, is far more than a conceptual gimmick: the first US screenings reportedly left viewers in tears and it's already being tipped for Oscars glory. Let's hope that Fincher, whose Zodiac was one of last year's best films, can keep the sentimentality in check.</p> <p>Expect the film to ask big questions about death, loss and love - the last being a particularly perplexing matter for a man ageing backwards. The women, played by Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton, who become romantically engaged with Button in the film will grow old as he discovers his youth. Munich screenwriter Eric Roth adapted the story, which, according to Fitzgerald, 'was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end'.</p> <p>\u2022 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is released on 23 January</p>",
  "<p>Lebanon, summer 1982. One of the most controversial wars in Israel's short history is in full flow. In an area of west Beirut under Israeli army control, thousands of Palestinian refugees are slaughtered by Lebanese Christian Phalangist militiamen. Twenty years will pass before director Ari Folman, a young Israeli soldier at the time, begins a journey into his repressed past and returns to the days of the notorious Sabra and Shatila massacre. It will take him four more years of intensive film-making with a talented team of illustrators and animators before he delivers the result: the animated documentary Waltz with Bashir, Israel's most praised film in recent years.</p> <p>The film, which won six Israeli Film Academy awards and is Israel's official entry for best foreign film in next year's Oscars, has been at the centre of a cacophony of reviews, talkbacks and personal exchange since its domestic release last June. In one of the recurring scenes, naked figures emerge from the sea at Beirut, rifles hanging across their bony torsos. They seem cut off from the atrocities taking place nearby. Shades of black and orange dominate the background and eerie music plays. There is no dialogue, only haunting images of tormented men reaching a tormented place.</p> <p>This silence has been mirrored by audiences in Israeli cinemas. It lingers until long after the end credits have rolled; and it settled on my colleagues and me as we left a London preview screening, struggling to gather our thoughts and feelings into words.</p> <p>My older brother was a soldier in Lebanon in 1982. I was 12 years old and I remember only fragmentary details: my mother keeping herself frantically busy (her way, she would later say, of coping with 'maternal worries'); the cherries my brother brought from Lebanon when he came back on leave; the names of 'fallen' soldiers on the TV screen each evening before the news; and the 400,000-strong demonstration in Tel Aviv after the atrocities in Sabra and Shatila were exposed.</p> <p>My cousin was killed while on reserve duty in Tyre; all I remember was the car that brought the news and took my father to his bereaved sister.</p> <p>For years, Ariel Sharon, Israel's defence minister at the time of the 1982 invasion, was the ultimate villain in our household, but we never really talked about my brother's experience in Lebanon. In 2001, the national psyche exercised its formidable forgetfulness once again as the majority of Israelis voted Sharon Prime Minister.</p> <p>'I know so little about these events,' said one of my companions at the screening. 'I tried to remember where I was when this war took place, but I can't.'</p> <p>Regardless of where we were at the time, Waltz with Bashir makes us all reflect on this past from where we are now - still entrenched in a bloody Middle East. It also invites us to contemplate how Israel's past has been represented in film.</p> <p>Even before the establishment of Israel in 1948, and until the early Sixties, films did engage with Israel's military struggle to establish its own state and survival, but usually in the context of a hostile and indistinguishable Arab mass, one labelled as the ultimate enemy. Israeli fighters were depicted as heroes. The few feature films made in Israel up to the Sixties, such as Hill 24 Doesn't Answer, the iconic 1955 film about the 1948 war by British director Thorold Dickinson, were clearly part of the collective effort to justify the Zionist cause and foster a strong national identity.</p> <p>The focus on the external threat and the battle for survival shifted during the Sixties. Israeli cinema turned its lenses to internal matters, notably the massive migration and the cultural diversity of the newly formed society.</p> <p>It wasn't until the Eighties that Israeli cinema acknowledged a Palestinian people and individual Palestinians - a development termed 'the return of the repressed' by leading film scholar Ella Shohat. While the first Lebanon war raged in 1982, creating ever larger rifts within Israeli-Jewish society, Israeli films brought Palestinian stories onto the screen for the first time. </p> <p>Daniel Waxman's Hamsin (1982) and On a Narrow Bridge by Nissim Dayan (1985) both engage with love stories between mixed couples, while Uri Barbash's Beyond the Walls, which received an Oscar nomination in 1984, used the prison drama genre to dramatise a powerful alliance between Jewish and Palestinian prisoners as they fight together against the establishment. </p> <p>The 'Palestinian Wave' of the Eighties, however significant culturally, had limited popular appeal. Israeli cinema entered the Nineties with some critical zeal but it was more concerned with domestic issues than with confronting the national conflict head on. However, the groundwork for the flourishing Israeli cinema of today was laid during the Nineties, thanks to the establishment of film schools and film funds, shifts in local broadcasting, which created many more opportunities for local film-makers (before 1993, Israel had only one TV channel), and finally the New Cinema Law of 2000, which allocated significant public funding to the film industry.</p> <p>But what are the politics of this recent prosperity? Or rather, where are its politics?</p> <p>Some of the most recent successes have had little to do with the conflict. Late Marriage, the new wave's first box-office hit, from 2001, deals with the tensions between tradition and modernity within a close-knit Georgian-Israeli community.</p> <p>Nir Bergman's drama Broken Wings exposes a family's domestic difficulties after the sudden death of the father as the result of a bee sting. Avi Nesher's Turn Left at the End of the World, set among two migrant families in a development town in the late Sixties, harks back to the romantic Zionist idea of the Israeli 'melting pot'. These dramas were confined to the 'safe territories' of Israeli-Jewish society, limited mainly to urban landscapes and appealing to universal sentiments of family, romance and cultural differences.</p> <p>Some critics welcomed these trends as a sign that Israeli film-makers were finally thinking beyond the burden of national political concerns. However, this was not an option for the Palestinian-Israeli film-makers, who were also making their mark in the late Nineties and after.</p> <p>In films such as Chronicle of a Disappearance and Divine Intervention, both by Elia Suleiman, and Hany Abu-Assad's Oscar-nominated Paradise Now, the land of Israel/Palestine is marked by borders and boundaries that profoundly shape its inhabitants, who can only dwell on the multiple layers of the national conflict.</p> <p>Similar ground has been covered in documentaries by Israeli-Jewish film-makers. An early example is Amos Gitai's The House, from 1980, which touched on one of the great taboos - the effects of the 1948 war of independence on the Palestinians. It traced the history of a house in west Jerusalem, owned until 1948 by a Palestinian family. In recent years, the number of documentaries reflecting critically on the conflict has swelled: they include The Inner Tour (Ra'anan Alexandrowicz, 2001); Wall (Simone Bitton, 2004); and Avenge But One of My Two Eyes (Avi Mograbi, 2005).</p> <p>It is almost solely in documentaries that one can see Palestinian people and be exposed to their experiences and points of view. The individual figure of the Palestinian, with a name and a face, disappeared from Israeli feature films after the first Palestinian uprising in the late Eighties and has only rarely re-emerged in Israeli dramas since.</p> <p>Signs of a change are emerging, however. A number of recent popular Israeli films, including Close to Home, the Oscar-nominated Beaufort, Lemon Tree and Waltz with Bashir, deal with the national conflict as it plays into the lives of individuals in the region. (All of these films have been, or are soon to be, on general release in the UK.)</p> <p>Of these, only Lemon Tree portrays a Palestinian experience and narrative. Co-written by Eran Riklis and the Palestinian-Israeli Suha Arraf, it tells the story of a Palestinian widow whose lemon grove is about to be uprooted by the Israeli army, due to its proximity to the newly built home of Israel's defence minister. The film establishes a powerful relationship between the widow and the minister's wife. The film, which continues to gain awards and large audiences across the world, had only limited commercial success in Israel.</p> <p>Joseph Cedar's Beaufort tells the story of Israeli soldiers in the last weeks before the Israeli retreat from Lebanon in 2000, but its romantic portrayal of young male soldiers, typical of more traditional war films, undermines the film's stated anti-war declarations. Waltz with Bashir, on the other hand, never falls into the cliche of male comradeship in times of war, even though the story is told from an Israeli point of view.</p> <p>'War films miss the mark of being anti-war,' director Ari Folman has said. 'When you watch films like that at the age of 15, you tell yourself that war is terrible but the soldiers are cool, heroic. I absolutely did not want kids to wish they were like the characters in the movie, including me... There is none of the Israeli glitter of war, no hyping of the fighters. Everyone is a classic anti-hero.'</p> <p>In the film, war and its aftermath are shown as the loneliest of experiences, devoid of shared memories or references. This alienation resonates in the innovative use of animation to recall, convey and construct true events from the past. The 'animated documentary' hybrid builds a critical distance between the audience and the events on the screen yet, paradoxically, this makes them more accessible: we can get up close to the evils of war and still reflect on them.</p> <p>Waltz... is a film about difficult and often traumatic repressed memories that haunt men decades after the events. It is also about individuals who live within a society that cultivates certain memories while relegating others to oblivion, hardly ever stopping to question the price.</p> <p>It has certainly touched a nerve in Israel. One hundred thousand people have seen the film since its release in June and it has received huge media attention. Some critics have assigned it to the genre of 'shooting and crying': films that focus on the suffering of Israeli soldiers while shying away from the Palestinian victims of the conflict, not ready to take responsibility for their role in creating and maintaining the tragic circumstances they lament. Others celebrated the unique treatment of significant historical events, praising how Waltz... made it possible to recall a difficult past. </p> <p>The act of remembering and reflecting on military experiences is present in other recent Israeli films about the bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Tamar Yarom's award-winning documentary To See If I'm Smiling narrates the testimonies of six Israeli women soldiers who served in the occupied territories. Avi Mograbi's 'musical documentary', Z32, which premiered this year at Cannes, is dedicated to the confession of an Israeli soldier who killed two innocent Palestinian policemen to avenge the death of Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>At the end of Folman's journey into his past, he is finally able to integrate his memories into his own biography. They have a shape, a place and even a sound. This is clearly a brave achievement. The question is: what he will do with these memories now that they have reached the surface?</p> <p>This same question must be asked of the Israeli public, who have clearly been touched by this animated journey. Will these exposed memories shed further light on the mechanism that so powerfully creates our shared history and collective identity? Will they change the way Israelis reflect on their past?</p> <p>In an emotional speech at the Israeli Academy Awards ceremony, Folman dedicated Waltz with Bashir to the children born to the film crew during the years of filming. He said: 'I hope that when they grow up, in 15 years' time, they will see this film on the big screen and it will have nothing to do with their lives.'</p> <p>Reflecting on my childhood memories through the imagery of Folman's remarkable film, I find myself wishing not for a pain-free, 'context-liberated' animation, but rather for one that can still hold a mirror to our own reflections 15 years from now. Whether these reflections will empower us to act and help us assume responsibility for our state of being remains to be seen.</p> <p>\u2022 Waltz with Bashir, Lemon Tree and To See If I'm Smiling will screen at the UK Jewish Film Festival, 8-20 November, in London cinemas, <a href=\"http://www.ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk\">ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk</a>. Waltz with Bashir is released on November 21, Lemon Tree on December 12</p> <h2>Israel on screen: The milestones</h2> <p><strong>Exodus (1960)</strong> Based on Leon Uris's sweeping novel, Otto Preminger's epic saga (featuring Sal Mineo) is about the founding of Israel in the days after the Second World War. Paul Newman starred as Ari Ben Canaan, the commander of the Exodus ship bringing 600 European Jews from British-blockaded Cyprus into the newly partitioned Palestine.</p> <p><strong>Sallah Shabati (1964)</strong> Brought Chaim Topol to world notice and became Israel's first big national cinema hit. It received an Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe. It concerned a large Jewish family from an Arab country arriving during the wave of immigration to Israel in the Fifties and the native Israelis' snobbish resistance to the newcomers. </p> <p><strong>Bourekas films</strong> Named after a light pastry delicacy, the Bourekas films of the Seventies are the most popular movies made in Israel. Although critically derided, these farcical, Carry On-like comedies and over-acted melodramas had low production values and usually depicted tensions between Mizrahi or Sephardi Jews and Ashkenazi Jews, the former being canny but poor, the latter conceited and arrogant. Boaz Davidson was the most successful director, gaining international fame in 1978 when his crude teen hit Lemon Popsicle was successfully dubbed into English and distributed on the nascent VHS market.</p> <p><strong>Raid on Entebbe (1977)</strong> An all-star cast included Charles Bronson, Jack Warden and Robert Loggia and featured Peter Finch's final role, playing future Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The action centred on the Israeli army's 500-strong commando response to the hijack of an Air France plane given permission to land at Entebbe airport in Uganda. An Israeli Top Gun, the film was used as a recruitment drive and, despite accusations of propagandism, it did much to encourage a new world-view of Israel as the little country with which you shouldn't mess.</p> <p><strong>Kadosh (1998) and Kippur (2000)</strong> Director Amos Gitai established himself at the forefront of Israel's new cinema when these films became international arthouse successes after appearing in the Official Selection at the Cannes Film Festival, paving the way for Israeli film's current renaissance. Kadosh was one of the first films to criticise Israel's orthodox religious community of Mea Shearim, while Kippur was one of the first renderings of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, set in the Golan Heights and featuring a helicopter crash similar to one suffered by the director.<br><strong>Jason Solomons</strong></p>",
  "<p>Backstage at the Dior ready-to-wear catwalk show in Paris last month, the biggest behind-the-scenes celebrity - excepting Galliano himself - is mostly to be found on her hands and knees in a dangerous cat's cradle of hairdryer cables, slathering moisturiser onto the bare legs of 45 models.</p> <p>'People think this is a glamorous job,' grins Pat McGrath, the woman Vogue has called 'the most influential make-up artist in the world', looking up from between a girl's feet. She spends the pre-show hour dashing through toxic clouds of hairspray between the 22 make-up artists working under her direction, scrutinising the details of each girl's face and legs as the minutes tick away to curtain up: 'More on the brows here!' she calls, tilting one face up to the light, before moving on to the next, whose body make-up is wrong - 'Get it all off and start again!' - and the next, whose hairpiece isn't staying put. Time is so tight that McGrath and her team are still attending the girls as they are getting dressed to go on stage, dabbing and primping from the portable kits strapped to their persons with an air of organised emergency, like a slightly camp triage team.</p> <p>In the midst of what looks to me, experiencing my first fashion show, like irremediable chaos, 38-year-old McGrath is a stately presence, a beacon of calm who manages to mute the rising panic in everyone around her. She finds time to chat to journalists and camera crews while fixing foundation mishaps, reassures anxious models and soothes fretful hairdressers, and miraculously the show goes up almost on time with everyone looking as damn near perfect as possible. I never once catch her without a smile on her face; she seems to be positively enjoying the atmosphere of imminent catastrophe and remains refreshingly down to earth amid the inevitable mincing and preening of the fashion world hangers-on. 'I thrive on the adrenaline,' she says afterwards, grinning broadly. 'I actually do enjoy that side of it, knowing that at any moment something could go disastrously wrong.' Asked if anything has gone momentously wrong in recent memory, she only laughs. 'All the time! But you wouldn't know. And even if I'm not calm on the inside, you'll never know it.'</p> <p>The Dior show is only one of 26 she will do in the three weeks of the autumn season; for the past seven years she has counted 20 designers among her regular clients, including Stella McCartney, Prada, Miu Miu, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and on occasion her schedule in Paris is so tight that she has to be couriered between shows on the back of a motorbike to dodge the traffic. Some of her creations have made fashion history; the Egypt show she worked on for Dior in 2004 was a particular favourite, with the faces pasted in gold and jewel-colours like Tutankhamun's death mask. Past shows, in which she has taken inspiration from portraits of Elizabeth I, kabuki masks or modern art, have drawn on her innovative use of bold colour and placed the emphasis on the high-art side of her work, though she's equally at home with high-street fashion. </p> <p>'What first attracted me to fashion was the wildest clothes and make-up,' she explains later, over tea in a cafe near her London home in Maida Vale (she also has an apartment and an office in New York, where she spends most of her time). 'I loved those shows where you're able to dream, I loved the fantasy element of it, because even the so-called reality of fashion is a kind of fantasy. But that's what draws you into fashion, so when people say, \"Oh my God, I could never wear that\", I'm like, yes you will. Because no matter how insane something looks in the shows, there's always an idea there that will filter down to the high street in a different version eventually.'</p> <p>Fashion and beauty have been part of McGrath's life for as long as she can remember; her Jamaican mother, Jean, was obsessed with clothes and cosmetics, and a combination of thrift and the lack of make-up for black skin fuelled her creativity. From her, the young Pat learnt to experiment with products, sweeping lipstick over eyes and cheeks and mixing her own face creams, as well as a feel for picking out fabrics. 'My mum had no background in fashion but she'd taught herself to sew and she was amazing, she used to make all my clothes from designer patterns. We'd be going to church in Calvin Klein military at the age of 11.' She giggles. Growing up in Northampton in the Seventies and Eighties, she and her brother and sister were dragged endlessly around vintage shops. 'We hated it, we'd all go in there like this,' she says, holding her nose, 'because of that vintage smell, and my mum'd be going, \"Look at this, it's 1920s!\" And she'd take us every Friday to buy make-up, looking for colours that would work on black skin. In those days you'd be lucky if you could find one eyeshadow with heavy pigment.'</p> <p>McGrath describes her family life as 'very religious, very conservative'; her teenage rebellion was to develop a fascination with the Blitz Kids (Boy George, Marilyn, Spandau Ballet, famed for their outr\u00e9 make-up), whom she used to follow around the King's Road when she sneaked away to London. 'We thought we were New Romantics, we'd get changed on the train and try to get into all those clubs,' she says, shaking her head in mock embarrassment at the memory. 'I was doing an art foundation course at college so I'd tell my mum I was going to art galleries. Then I'd get home and open my bag and she'd say, \"My God, there's so much smoke in those galleries\", and I'd be like, I know Mum, everyone smokes in the city, it's terrible.'</p> <p>She had been planning to do a fashion degree, but the club scene proved a more useful entr\u00e9e; she got to know the stylist Kim Bowen, one-time muse of the Blitz kids set. When McGrath said she wanted to be a make-up artist, Bowen invited her to come along and watch shoots for The Face and i-D. She took a day job as a receptionist at the Department of Transport, and drifted into helping out on music videos and magazine shoots at night through friends and people she met in the clubs. </p> <p>'Kim would call me up and say, \"Have you got a book together yet?\"' McGrath remembers, 'and although I loved the fun we had on set, I just never quite got it together and went for it. So the jobs would always go to someone better known, and eventually I just resigned myself to the idea that I would never make it. There was one evening when I was just sitting in my living room in the dark and I thought, \"I'm never going to become a make-up artist, I'm finished, I'm going to have to get a real job\", because at that point my mum was saying, \"Maybe you should take a hint\".'</p> <p>It was at precisely that moment that the fairy-tale break came. 'The phone rang and it was someone asking if I wanted to go on tour in Japan with Caron Wheeler from Soul II Soul. I'd done her make-up one Sunday afternoon three years earlier as a favour, and she took my number saying she'd call me some time. And that was it - I left my job and went to Japan for three months, scared to death. I cried all the way there because I'd never been on a plane before and I was terrified.'</p> <p>After that, she was offered 'every music job in London', and gradually moved into fashion, working first with Jil Sander and Hussein Chalayan, and forging enduring creative partnerships with individual photographers, first Paolo Roversi, with whom she worked for French and Italian Vogue, and later Steven Meisel, who uses her for all his editorial work in New York.</p> <p>But if there was a degree of diversity in the music industry in the mid-Nineties, the fashion world was still almost entirely white. Naomi Campbell, whom McGrath counts as a friend ('I started working with her in the early days and we've grown up together') was the only internationally recognised black supermodel, a situation that has barely changed in the past 10 years. </p> <p>'There has been a lot of campaigning on that issue and, no, it isn't fair,' McGrath says, when I ask about the lack of diversity on the catwalks and magazines. 'Thank God we've got Jourdan [Dunn] and Sessilee [Lopez] coming through, and I think there is the beginning of a change happening. I have noticed that over this past year.'</p> <p>She speaks carefully on this issue, and I get the sense that she doesn't want to come across as too militant. Even so, I say, out of 45 girls at the Dior show I saw, two were black and one south-east Asian; all the others were Identikit blondes.</p> <p>'It's not enough,' McGrath agrees, 'and the change is too slow. It's up to people like myself to keep pushing.'</p> <p>Does she feel her profile serves as inspiration for young black women who might otherwise have thought that the fashion industry was only for posh skinny white girls, \u00e0 la Amanda from Ugly Betty.</p> <p>'Absolutely,' she says, nodding emphatically, 'I'm always stopped by girls on the street who tell me, \"Oh my God, I love what you do, I'm going to be a make-up artist\" - they always give me their phone numbers. </p> <p>'The other night I was at a party at the O2 and these two young black girls came up with their faces all done up with the look from one of the shows. They said \"We always look for your stuff on the web and we copied it\". It is really important for young women to see that you can work in fashion, it's open to everyone.'</p> <p>This confidence, she says, is another legacy from her mother, who was a firm believer that everyone had the right to enjoy fashion.</p> <p>'She'd bring me to London to the designer shops to look at the new collections and she'd press the buzzer - remember when you had to press the buzzer?' she giggles. 'She'd be ringing the bell and the woman would come to the door and turn grey, and my mum would just stand there until she opened. Then my mum'd say, \"My daughter would like to try on that dress in the window\". And I'd be shaking, trying on all these clothes we could never afford, but my mum would be really firm about it, she'd say, \"They've got to get used to real people shopping in here\". And look at the industry today - the injection of designer fashion into the high street.'</p> <p>Like fellow celebrity make-up artists Bobbi Brown, Fran\u00e7ois Nars and Laura Mercier, McGrath is also at work on her own high-street cosmetic brand, which will be launched in around 18 months' time - she previously worked with Armani, developing his cosmetic collection and also holds the impressively titled post of global creative design director for Procter &amp; Gamble, developing the Cover Girl and Max Factor lines, a job she describes as a 'dream come true'.</p> <p>She confesses to being something of a workaholic, often working 10-hour days (double that during fashion weeks) and keeping a tight rein on how much she indulges in the party side of the fashion world. 'I do love that aspect, but for me it is more about hard graft,' she says. 'During fashion week a friend called me and said, \"Pat, where are you?\" - there was a huge dinner and I'd completely forgotten, I was in bed.' </p> <p>Though she's single at the moment - her hectic schedule means she is rarely in one city for more than a few days at a time - she says she would like to settle, and have a family in the future. </p> <p>For someone who spends so much time on planes, she has flawless skin. Disappointingly, she has no magic bullet - she travels with suitcases full of products, and says she couldn't possibly single out one that she couldn't live without - but cites all the old advice: good moisturiser, plenty of water. She goes regularly to a dermatologist in New York and says she is paranoid about spots. But the truth, she says, is that good skin is inherited; like her confidence and pride in herself, and her love of experimental fashion and beauty, her skin is one more thing she owes to her late mother. And saying so, she finishes her tea and skitters away to catch another plane.</p>",
  "<p>Graham, the immigration and customs official at New York's JFK airport, is slumped behind his desk, a sour expression on his face. 'Reason for your visit?' he asks, barely bothering to look up from the fingerprint scanner. I tell him I'm here to interview Clint Eastwood. He stares at me, eyes widening in disbelief. 'Clint Eastwood?' he asks, suddenly wreathed in good cheer. 'I love that guy!' He jauntily stamps my passport and waves me through. 'Tell him I said hi.'</p> <p>The taxi driver whoops with joy when he finds out. 'Go ahead and make my day!' he shouts through the plastic dividing screen as we whizz across the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge at perilous speed. 'Do ya feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya?' The check-in clerk at reception in my hotel is also an Eastwood devotee. 'Tell him he's got a fan down here in the lobby.' The clerk shakes his head. 'I mean, jeez, he's a living legend.'</p> <p>Men have a thing about Clint. It is partly the way he looks: broad-shouldered and quietly heroic, as if chiselled out of a 6ft block of solid oak. At 78, his face is weatherbeaten like well-worn saddle leather, lined with the dips and grooves of experience. His eyes, flinty hazel and crinkled at the corners like paper twists of salt, seem perpetually to scan the faraway horizon, as if on the lookout for an ululating tribe of ferocious Native Americans.</p> <p>Then there's the back catalogue that reads like a checklist of male archetypes. In the Sixties, Eastwood was the 'Man With No Name' in Sergio Leone's iconic western trilogy A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. A decade later, he became Harry Callahan, the hard-bitten cop who played fast and loose with the rules in Don Siegel's Dirty Harry. More recently, In the Line of Fire saw him as a Secret Service agent, and he played a gruff boxing coach in Million Dollar Baby. His directorial two-hander, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, took as its subject men in battle in the Second World War. In 1992, he directed and starred as a retired gunslinger in the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, a western that asked the quintessential male questions: what differentiates the hero from the villain? What separates a man from his myth? And why are the whores in movies always called things like 'Strawberry Alice'? </p> <p>Cowboys, cops, soldiers, boxers... It is difficult, when I eventually meet Eastwood in a chintzy hotel suite at the Waldorf Astoria, not to treat him as the embodiment of all that is most masculine and stoic. He is dressed, according to type, in a faded leather jacket, brown trousers and a beige striped polo shirt. He is one of the few male celebrities who, in reality, is just as tall as he looks on screen. He has, of course, a firm handshake.</p> <p>So it is a pleasant surprise to discover that Eastwood resolutely refuses to take himself seriously. He sneezes almost as soon as I walk into the room. 'I'm sorry, I'm ill. I can't do this interview now,' he twinkles. Thankfully, this is a joke. He sits down on one of the suite's two sofas and spreads a large hand over each knee with the acute deliberation of someone whose limbs are not quite as well-oiled as they once were. He will be 80 in two years and I have been told that he is mildly deaf, though there is no sign of this: if he asks me to repeat something, it is generally because I have not been precise enough. </p> <p>He has a pleasingly old-fashioned and gentlemanly turn of phrase. When Eastwood is really riled by something, he calls it 'BS' in case the term 'bullshit' offends my dainty female ears. Angelina Jolie, his latest leading lady, is 'an extremely attractive gal' and later, as I am leaving, he calls me 'duck' (it is meant affectionately - I'm sure ducks can be attractive, too).</p> <p>When I ask how it feels to be a living legend of male iconography, he laughs - a throaty chuckle that sounds like the crackle of tinder burning. 'It makes you feel old. I joke about it. I say it's just that I outlived everybody else. We lost Paul Newman the other day and, you know, he and I were approximate ages - I came just behind him - and then Steve McQueen, James Coburn, all those guys, we all were around at the same time and most of them are gone now.</p> <p>'Out of that whole group, I think, there's Dustin Hoffman, James Garner, and that's about all that's left.' He pauses. 'And me. I'm in the mix there.' He shifts forward and looks at me sideways. He grins, revealing a set of absurdly straight, white teeth, like a freshly painted picket fence. 'You just keep having a good time and making films and having a good life.'</p> <p>It is a philosophy that inspires a prodigious work rate. Over the past five years, Eastwood has directed at the rate of a film a year. Three of them - Mystic River, Letters from Iwo Jima and Million Dollar Baby - won Academy Awards, including his second Best Director Oscar for Million Dollar Baby (the first was for Unforgiven in 1993). The Human Factor, a biopic of Nelson Mandela starring Morgan Freeman, is in pre-production and he has almost completed directing and acting in yet another film, Gran Torino</p> <p>Behind the camera, Eastwood has achieved a level of artistic respect he never quite managed as an actor (Sergio Leone once remarked that he liked Eastwood because he only had two facial expressions: 'one with the hat and one without it'). As a director, Eastwood prefers to deal in dramatic narrative rather than special effects: his films tend to be bleakly compelling stories with several strands of subtlety, shot in richly textured shades of penumbral light. He is renowned for his low budgets and unpretentious attitude - he limits rehearsals and dislikes endless takes. Often, Eastwood composes his own soundtrack. He is not one to dwell on the tortuous creative demands of his art.</p> <p>'At some point, after you've done this for so many years, you kind of think, well, everything is do-able, it's just a question of how difficult it can be,' he says. 'I don't sit there and worry about it. You just do it. It's not like somebody's standing you up there and saying, \"OK, recite the Greek alphabet\" or something.'</p> <p>His latest offering, Changeling, came with its own set of challenges. It is set in late-Twenties Los Angeles and it took months to find a suitably preserved neighbourhood - most of the older buildings in LA have been torn down to make room for superhighways and shopping centres. In the end, location scouts discovered a tree-lined block of period homes in the Old Town district of suburban San Dimas, about 35 miles east of downtown LA.</p> <p>Changeling tells the extraordinary true story of Christine Collins, a single mother who returned home from work one day to find that her nine-year-old son, Walter, had disappeared. After a five-month investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department claimed to have found him, but Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) remained convinced the boy was an impostor. The police refused to believe her and had her incarcerated in a psychiatric ward, accusing her of being delusional. An interwoven plotline deals with the police investigation into serial killer Gordon Northcott. Northcott, who abducted and sexually abused dozens of young boys on a ranch in Wineville, California, was hanged for murder in 1930.</p> <p>'It's a tough one for parents to watch,' Eastwood says. 'It's a woman's horror story - the dilemma of being a woman in the Twenties and the dilemma of losing a child and what to do when you don't have a political system or a police system that would come to your rescue.'</p> <p>It is also a hauntingly sinister piece of work, laced with intimations of depravity. As in Mystic River, the viewer is offered stark relief from the dominant themes of corruption, murder and paedophilia. 'I don't mind telling a dark side,' says Eastwood, with characteristic understatement. 'Drama usually has some sort of intense conflict. Crimes against children are the most heinous crime. That, for me, would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society.'</p> <p>Northcott was given two years' solitary confinement before he was led to the scaffold - a sentence Eastwood admiringly calls 'creative'. Although he describes himself as 'libertarian', he is unapologetically in favour of the death penalty. 'I guess it's because I have a very fertile imagination and I always sympathise with the victim. I never sympathise with the accused unless there's a chance the accused is not guilty, but I certainly don't ever sympathise with the criminal. I mean, I'm not one of these guys who sits around saying, \"Gee, I mean, the person had a strange childhood and that's why he's doing this horrible thing. Poor Jeffrey Dahmer. He's just had a bad childhood and that's why he's eating people.\" Wait a second! This person should be removed from the planet.'</p> <p>Later, when the conversation has somehow strayed on to Islamic fundamentalism, Eastwood is similarly outspoken. 'Imagine somebody telling some 12-, 13-, 14-year-old kid: \"Put on a vest, go out and blow up people and then you'll go to Heaven and there'll be 72 virgins.\" I mean, imagine the stupidity of that from our point of view. You think, wait a second, you don't even know if there is a hereafter and, if there is, what's so great about virgins?'</p> <p>Serial killers and virgins aside, one of the most notable things about Changeling is that it is driven by a complex female protagonist, a woman whose strength is forged through fragility and desperation. Million Dollar Baby, which featured Hilary Swank as a waitress-turned-boxer, was also dominated by a portrayal of female strength in adversity. For all that he is indelibly associated with overpoweringly male roles, does Eastwood feel equally at home directing films about feisty women?</p> <p>'I mean, I love stories about women.' A pause. 'I'm not a chick-flick enthusiast,' he adds, hurriedly, 'but that's what I like about this [Changeling]. It's a wonderful story of what this woman had to go through and how she has to change and what it does to her life. And that, to me, is a film that is reminiscent of the Forties, of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford or somebody who was trying to overcome something. It seemed like the stories there involved the women more, rather than them just being, you know, fluff. I like that a lot.</p> <p>'Every picture has its own demands and every picture stimulates something within you to tell it a certain way. I don't know what that is; I don't think too much about that.'</p> <p>What does he, a lifelong Republican, make of Sarah Palin, John McCain's 'bit of fluff' vice-presidential nominee? 'You can't help but like her. She's got a certain charm. Because of the way she talks and everything, she's obviously from a rural area, but that's refreshing in a way. I like her [...] But, uh, whether she... whether any of these people would be good on a presidential basis remains to be seen.'</p> <p>Eastwood had his own flirtation with politics for a brief period between 1986 and 1988 after he was elected mayor of small Californian town Carmel-by-the-Sea with 72.5 per cent of the vote. Was he ever tempted to take his political ambitions on to the national stage?</p> <p>'Me?' he asks in a tone of complete surprise, as if there might be someone else in the room. 'No, not at all. When I was Mayor of Carmel people would come and ask me to run for state office. Painters would hang from buildings and shout, \"Hey, Clint! Why don't you run?\" And I said, \"Not a chance.\" I enjoyed being Mayor of Carmel, but you do see that it is very difficult to get things done. You just have to lose your soul. You have to BS people. You have to deal with people you don't care for and will never be friends with, so you kind of sell yourself out to be a politician. You have to kiss it up with the world. That ain't my style.'</p> <p>Clinton Eastwood was born to be big. His Wikipedia entry states that when his mother gave birth he weighed 14lbs (6.4kg). When I check the veracity of this, Eastwood is horrified. 'Fourteen pounds!' he exclaims. 'No, no. You read that where? Wow. Everything is so exaggerated!' </p> <p>There is a short silence for his astonishment to subside. 'No, I was 11 pounds.' That's not a huge difference, I say. He lets this sink in. 'Yeah,' he concedes, 'it's still pretty big. That was me: a big, fat guy. I was the biggest baby born at the St Francis Hospital [in San Francisco] at that particular time. My mother overate, I guess.'</p> <p>Eastwood had an itinerant childhood, moving around from city to city as his parents tried to find work in the grip of an economic depression. His father, Clinton Sr, was a steel worker. 'I moved around a lot. I was born in 1930 and lived in various towns in California, up and down: Sacramento Valley, Los Angeles for a little bit, Oakland, all these areas. But I had good parents who I think did the best they could, so I had a reasonable childhood. It was kind of lonely in some ways because you never went to the same school for six or seven months, you were always moving on somewhere. But it was OK.'</p> <p>His mother, Margaret, once said in a television documentary that the rootless nature of his upbringing meant that Eastwood often invented imaginary friends. This, she thought, was what led to his becoming an actor. The experience also left him with an abiding memory of what it was like to live on a limited income. 'It seemed like in those days, you had what you had and nothing more,' he says. 'In other words, if you had 10 dollars, you had 10 dollars. You didn't have 1,000 dollars on a credit card that you could just ring up. Nowadays we live in a dream world that offers you something for nothing.'</p> <p>After graduating from high school in 1949, Eastwood worked variously as a gas station attendant, a bar-room piano player and a firefighter before being drafted for a short time during the Korean War (he never saw action). He acted in several B-movies before getting his big break, starring as Rowdy Yates, the hotheaded cowboy in long-running television series Rawhide. The series turned him into a household name and brought him to the attention of Sergio Leone, who cast him in the first instalment of the Dollars trilogy in 1964. Eastwood has not been out of work since.</p> <p>In the old-school Hollywood style, Eastwood embarked on the obligatorily chequered private life. He married model Maggie Johnson in 1953, with whom he had two children, Kyle and Alison. At the same time, he fathered an illegitimate child with Roxanne Tunis, a Rawhide extra - his daughter Kimber's existence was not made public until 1989. </p> <p>Clint and Maggie divorced after Eastwood admitted a long-term affair with actress Sondra Locke, his co-star in several films. Locke and Eastwood were together for a tempestuous 14 years, during which time he had two further children, Scott and Kathryn, with air hostess Jacelyn Reeves. In her imaginatively titled autobiography The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly, Locke claimed Eastwood locked her out of the house, tapped her phone and persuaded her to have two abortions - allegations that Eastwood has always vehemently denied.</p> <p>An affair with actress Frances Fisher, his co-star in Unforgiven, produced another daughter, Francesca. His current wife, Dina, is a television anchorwoman, with whom he has an 11-year-old daughter, Morgan. The couple, who live happily on a sprawling ranch on California's Monterey peninsula, met in 1993 when Dina was interviewing him for the local news: she was 28 to Eastwood's 63.</p> <p>In spite of the ups and downs of his libidinous personal history, for most people, Eastwood will forever be inextricably linked with the western. But he says the genre is now in danger of being stifled by 'same old, same old' storylines. 'Down the line, someone has to come up with a new and imaginative approach or story. I'm a story guy. Unforgiven was the last truly great western I've ever read. For me, that was because it was telling a lot of things in different ways [...] I think back, [to all the] various westerns I've done and I think I've done about as much as I can with it.'</p> <p>He shifts backwards slightly on the sofa and gives me a languid smile. I am reminded of something Steven Spielberg once said of him: that the most wonderful thing about Eastwood's transition from bit-part actor to acclaimed film star and award-winning director was 'watching Clint remain the same man he's always been; that is to say, totally unimpressed with himself'. </p> <p>When I quote this back to him, Eastwood looks down at the parquet floor and scratches his right ear embarrassedly. 'Ahhh, I never think about it,' he says, hand flapping as if swatting away a fly. 'I never sit and analyse myself. Somebody - I can't remember if it was Burt Reynolds - once said: \"The trouble with Clint is that he doesn't realise he's a star,\" and I said: \"Well maybe that's a good thing.\" I mean, I just thought of myself as an actor trying to do parts and stuff. I'm a movie actor, not a star. </p> <p>'Everyone has to be a star now, but even that's not enough: you have to be a superstar. Where does it end? You can't be a model, you're a supermodel. When did this all come about? Everybody's trying to be so effusive. </p> <p>'I figure I'm just a guy doing pictures, that's all. I'm trying to tell stories and I do the best I can with them and if somebody thinks they're OK, fine, and if somebody doesn't, then that's their opinion and we move on from there.'</p> <p>He might not consider himself a superstar, but I feel sure that Graham at customs and immigration would disagree.</p> <p>\u2022 Changeling opens on 28 November</p> <p><strong>Clint as director: Boston to Boxing</strong></p> <h2>The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)</h2> <p>In 1999, Eastwood said the favourite of all his films was this unusual, complex western, made in the shadow of Vietnam, which takes a classic Eastwood loner, Josey Wales, and hitches him to a motley bunch of drifters. Wales, a Missouri farmer-turned-outlaw embittered by Civil War atrocities, becomes the group's unlikely leader.</p> <h2>Unforgiven (1992)</h2> <p>One of Eastwood's most widely praised films, Unforgiven does a brilliant job at deconstructing the romance of the western gunslinger. The film is set in 1880s Wyoming and Kansas, and the conceit is a familiar one - the retired gunfighter (Eastwood) who picks up his weapons for one last score - but Eastwood steers clear of easy resolutions. The film won four Oscars, including best film, best director and best supporting actor for Gene Hackman, memorable as a sadistic sheriff.</p> <h2>Mystic River (2003)</h2> <p>A brooding drama about childhood friends shattered by one terrible event and dragged back together, 25 years later, by another. The terrific cast includes Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, who both won Oscars for their performances, and Kevin Bacon. Working-class Boston, through Eastwood's lens, is grey and purgatorial.</p> <h2>Million Dollar Baby (2004)</h2> <p>Eastwood won his second directing Oscar for this tough, downbeat boxing movie, which also bagged best film. Hilary Swank plays a 32-year-old amateur eager to be trained by Eastwood's grizzled gym owner, Frank Dunn. Dunn, who has lost touch with his daughter, reluctantly takes her on and the film follows her rise through the ranks. </p> <h2>Flags of Our Fathers/Letters From Iwo Jima (2006)</h2> <p>Eastwood's epic diptych of the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima explores the bloody conflict from both sides. The first film, from the American perspective, questions the notion of the national hero. The superior second film adopts the point of view of the Japanese as they dig themselves into their suicidal positions on the small Pacific island.</p> <h2>Changeling (2008)</h2> <p>Changeling tells the bizarre true story of Christine Collins, whose young son Walter went missing in 1928. When a boy claiming to be Walter turned up five months later, Collins refused to believe it was her child. The police in turn refused to believe her and placed her in a psychiatric ward. The film premiered at Cannes last May.</p> <h2>What's it like working with Clint?</h2> <p><strong>Angelina Jolie:</strong> 'He is, to me, very much the ideal man. He is absolutely who he is. He has very, very strong, decisive opinions and is very gracious as a man, as a friend and somebody on set as a director, too.' </p> <p><strong>Morgan Freeman: </strong>'He spends his time getting the film made. He doesn't direct the actors. He directs the film.' </p> <p><strong>Hilary Swank:</strong> 'He's the most amazing collaborator. When all is said and done and you've watched the movie, his fingerprints are all over it. And you didn't even notice the gentle guidance because he's so subtle and so simple.' </p> <p><strong>Kevin Bacon:</strong> 'Meryl Streep had told me, \"You're really going to like working with Clint.\" There was no rehearsal, maybe two or three takes. That kind of implies a hurried atmosphere, but it was actually relaxed, the most prepared set.' </p> <p><strong>Tim Robbins:</strong> 'Clint is a true artist in every respect. Despite his years of being at the top of his game and the legendary movies he has made, he always made us feel comfortable and valued on the set, treating us as equals. It was a great experience.'</p>",
  "<p>Old people seeing their life savings going up in smoke; middle-class families unable to meet their mortgage payments; young graduates, their dreams of affluence crushed, obliged to abandon their first homes... these are the new norms in Iceland, whose people, the most hard hit until now by the world's catastrophic financial crisis, are in a state of shock. 'Like the survivors of an earthquake,' said one. 'Our 11 September,' lamented another.</p> <p>Iceland, a miniature caricature of the prosperity without end the developed world seemed until recently to be enjoying, offers suddenly a frightening vision of the pit of despond into which Europe, the United States and the rest of the world's hitherto wealthy nations risk falling. With the country's foreign reserves gone, the greater part of the banking system nationalised and the country declared by the prime minister to be practically bankrupt, </p> <p>Iceland is at the epicentre of a global earthquake whose impact the most crazed participant in the attack on New York's World Trade Center would not have dared to imagine.</p> <p>The national trauma - ex-pressed in shame, anger, fear - comes from the clash between the vast self-satisfaction accumulated over two decades of rampaging growth and the brutal suddenness of the fall. A United Nations report earlier this year identified Iceland as the best country in the world in which to live. A survey published in serious newspapers in 2006 said that the Icelanders (who, contrary to myth, do not have a high suicide rate - it is lower than France's and Australia's) were the happiest people on earth. Today, Iceland's future is at the mercy of the International Monetary Fund, as if the country occupied not the first place in the United Nations Development Programme's latest Human Development Index rankings, but had replaced Sierra Leone in the last. In a measure of the general despair, the government has been flirting with what most Icelanders seem to view as the dire notion of accepting a big loan from Russia, whose people, according to that same survey, are the unhappiest in the world.</p> <p>The criteria used by the UNDP report did not focus only on the fact that this country of 300,000 inhabitants, located in one of the most inhospitable eco-systems on the planet, had managed to achieve the sixth highest GDP per capita in the world. As I found when I went there six months ago to check up on this unlikely marvel, there remains a lot more for the Icelanders to cherish and preserve.</p> <p>The quality of their public health and education systems (even the fleetingly filthy rich saw little need to use private schools or private medicine) may be equalled somewhere, but not surpassed; the state plays a decisive role in ensuring that mothers have the same access to the labour market as fathers, and this in a country that has the highest childbirth rate in Europe; an extraordinarily enlightened attitude towards divorce, in which the overwhelming priority is the welfare of the children, means that the notion of 'broken homes' is something Icelanders read about in foreign magazines; as for clean and renewable energy - hot water from the island's volcanic depths is the principal source of electricity - Iceland is a world leader; and as for a generalised love of reading and music, there is nowhere quite like it.</p> <p>It was for these reasons - far more than for the hip bars and gourmet restaurants and super-cool hotels, amid plenty more visible measures of abundancy in the capital, Reykjavik - that I bought into the conclusions of the UNDP report. My work takes me all over the world and I have lived in eight countries, but never have I encountered such a concentration of open-minded, intelligent, enterprising people as I have in Iceland. </p> <p>Too enterprising, as it turns out. The achievements built up over 1,000 years of human habitation on this windy, chilly island are at risk now, owing to the Viking exuberance that many had chosen to identify as the engine of the Icelandic miracle, as the reason why in half a century Iceland passed from being the poorest country in Europe to one of the richest, with zero unemployment. The president himself, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, had boasted as recently as May, in a speech in London, that the ancestral Viking virtues immortalised in the ancient 'sagas' - the alpha-male derring-do of those fearless bands that ventured out into an unmapped world to plunder and subjugate - were the secret of 'why daring Icelander entrepreneurs are succeeding where others hesitate or fail'. </p> <p>Four weeks ago, with the finance system in freefall, Grimsson underwent a heart operation. He emerged to make a TV appearance in which he begged his compatriots to forgive him for making what - he could see in retrospect - was a buffoonish spectacle of himself as head of a country now perceived globally as an ostentatious upstart, and by some (such as Gordon Brown) as a debt-defaulting pariah. </p> <p>Iceland's bankers, the Viking vanguard, operated in 20 countries (this is a nation, it must be remembered, with a population barely bigger than Hull's) and had bought themselves big businesses in Britain and Denmark (not excluding, as if they were Arab sheikhs or Russian oligarchs, a London football club, West Ham). But in so doing, the national debt outstripped the country's real wealth by a factor of 12. The ties that bind the global banking system broke and the Icelandic bubble burst.</p> <p>The Icelanders are divided between those who chiefly blame the government, for having deregulated the financial laws to such an extent that - short of outright piracy - anything went, and those who blame the bankers, whose extravagance the rest of the citizenry beheld in the spontaneous parties they hosted in the swankier bars of Reykjavik, swilling \u00a31,000- a-bottle champagne as if it were beer.</p> <p>Thorir Bergsson is among those who are inclined to blame the government, reasoning as he does that people whose business it is to do money will by their very nature stretch the boundaries of what the law allows. It is his view that it is up to the government now to come up with a solution to his pressing, and absolutely typical, dilemma.</p> <p>Bergsson, 39, is a chef in what had been until now a successful restaurant in Reykjavik's equivalent of Regent Street (taking into account that Reykjavik from the outside has the feel of a Faroe Island fishing village). Today the clientele is down by 40 per cent, some employees have been let go and he himself is contemplating the prospect of accepting a reduction in his salary. His wife is an anthropologist who works for the Reykjavik city council in a department that deals with immigrants. It is a post that could cease soon to have much relevance.The foreign population, largely from Poland and the Baltic states, is beginning to dwindle, driven elsewhere by the plummeting local currency, the krona. Suddenly, as Bergsson noted, it seems highly likely that Icelanders will find themselves competing for 'the dirty hands' jobs they had imagined they would never have to touch again.</p> <p>But that is not the worst of it. The worst of it is that Bergsson simply cannot pay his monthly mortgage payments, nor those of his car loan, without the four children who live with him and his wife going hungry. The couple have two small children of their own, but each has an adolescent child from a previous relationship - a state of affairs that is not only common in Iceland, it is considered entirely natural. Between the two of them they earn around 850,000 krona a month. That was worth around \u00a37,000 two months ago; now it is worth less than \u00a34,500, and falling. </p> <p>Following their bank's advice, they had opted, as many Icelanders had done, to take out their mortgage in a 'basket' of foreign currencies. In the all-day and all-night light of summer they were making monthly payments of 160,000 krona; the next payment due, as the long black winter sets in, is for 400,000. On the car, Bergsson and his wife have to pay 60,000. 'If we then add the 36 per cent we pay in tax, we're left with practically nothing,' says Bergsson, when we meet for lunch at a city centre restaurant that is otherwise empty at 1.15pm on a Wednesday. 'This is why I am left with no option but to go to the bank and inform them that I have no intention of paying this month. Everyone is in the same boat. The whole country is on hold.'</p> <p>They are waiting to see, for example, what the effect will be of a loan freshly agreed with the IMF, whether it means that the country's bare coffers will now be further replenished with money from the Russians or, as many wish (given the widespread fears that a big Russian investment might undermine Iceland's sovereign identity), from their cousins in Scandinavia. Only once a loan package is on the table will it be possible for the government to try to come up with some sort of rescue plan. 'Yet there is another thing I prefer almost not to think about,' says Bergsson, who insists that he is staying calm, though his eyes betray an air of anguish bordering on physical pain. 'Our home, in which we had invested so many dreams and so much money, is losing value with every day that passes.'</p> <p>Bergsson recognises, all the same, that there are many people worse off than he is. Among them, the thousand or so young bank employees - in many cases the cream of the Icelandic education system, people with Masters degrees and doctorates from foreign universities - who have been fired in the past month, and who had bet on the good life with more rash credit-taking exuberance than he had done. 'But those that make me the saddest, because after all </p> <p>I still have time to reconstruct my life, are the old people who have lost their savings.'</p> <p>It has been a surprise to discover how reluctant Icelanders are (Bergsson is a rare exception) to talk about the dramas they are enduring. This is shown in the fact that when I was there, two weeks into the full-blown crisis, the Icelandic newspapers hadn't published any stories about the ordinary victims of the crash - at least, none mentioning any names. It was as if the journalists understood that Icelanders were too ashamed to look at themselves in the mirror. That was why the majority of case histories that I heard were second-hand.</p> <p>Such as the one - again, entirely typical - of the father-in-law of a writer who retired on the Friday before the Monday on which his bank, Glitnir, had to be nationalised. 'He is 70 years old. He was an executive of a hydroelectric power company,' said the writer, who asked not to be named. 'Early this year the bank convinced him - as they had done many others of his age and circumstances - to transfer his life savings from a solid account that yielded interest of 14 per cent to one that yielded 20. They assured him that the move was riskier in theory, but not so in practice. The solidity of the world banking system was his guarantee, they told him. So he transferred the funds and, within barely 48 hours of his retirement, he saw how the money he had saved with a view to enjoying the last years of his life had gone forever.'</p> <p>The writer, who has three small children, enjoys the good fortune of having almost paid off his mortgage. Yet he does not consider himself to be safe. On the one hand, his wife risks losing her job in an organisation which depends for its existence on the sponsorship of an Icelandic bank. On the other hand, because of the worrying economic prospects his publishers have told him they cannot afford to print three books he has written, and that they had commissioned. What is more, there are signs that the biggest book-selling chain in Iceland could go under, which could have a catastrophic effect on the biggest publisher. 'And all this,' the writer says, 'in a country where, until now, individuals have been buying more books than anywhere else!'</p> <p>As for Iceland's musical tradition, the country suffered another blow to morale when it was announced two weeks ago that a planned tour of Japan by the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra had been cancelled. The organisers wrote to say that, given the crisis, it would be best if they did not come.</p> <p>One way out for musicians and others able to compete internationally is to emigrate. And this is precisely the biggest fear of the dozen or so people I talked to for this article. 'If we are going to get out of this mess, if we are going to rebuild the country on a solid and enduring base, if we are going to take the essential step of diversifying our economy, what we must not see is a brain drain,' says Svafa Gronfeldt, rector of the University of Reykjavik. 'We are a survivor nation, by definition. To have managed to create a good life here has been the result of a tremendous imagination and great practical resourcefulness. Our great advantage today is that we have a lot of highly trained young people able to function in the global market. We must retain them.'</p> <p>Thorir Bergsson is not a typical case in the sense that he is a chef (though one of the many symptoms of the Icelandic success story has been an abundance of excellent restaurants in the capital), but he does reflect the attitude of many others who share his option of finding employment abroad. 'We don't want to go, even though my wife and I both know that we could get jobs elsewhere,' he says. 'But it would be terrible if people of my generation were to abandon ship now. Although, of course, if the welfare of our children is at risk, our idealism won't last for ever.'</p> <p>Dagur Eggertsson, ex-mayor of Reykjavik and a doctor by training, says that the trauma the country is undergoing intensifies, especially in the case of the older people who have lost their savings, at the prospect of the best and the brightest leaving. </p> <p>'It's not only that it would cost us so much more to build up the economy again,' says Eggertsson<strong>, '</strong>it's that this is a country in which families are very united - maybe more united than ever right now - and the pain of separation would be terrible. I know a man who works for the government whose three children - two of them bankers, one a telecoms executive -have all just lost their jobs. He sees it as virtually inevitable that the three will go abroad.'</p> <p>Yet Eggertsson shares the opinion of Svafa Gronfeldt that Iceland could end up giving the world a lesson in how to emerge out of this great crisis. 'We must reflect on the humiliation we have endured, abandon those mythical old Viking values - after all, most people just stayed at home and worked - and replace them with something new,' he says.</p> <p>Such as what? Gronfeldt, and another half dozen women I interviewed, think they have the answer: 'Feminine values.' </p> <p>Iceland is the country with the highest percentage of women in full-time employment in the world, but, as Gronfeldt points out, almost all of them have remained stuck in the second or third tiers of management. 'The fact is, however, that women in this country are ready, able and willing and this crisis will accelerate their rise to the next step.'</p> <p>This has already started to happen, and in dramatic fashion. The new chief executives of the two big banks that have just been nationalised, Glitnir and Landsbanki, are both women, a development which one male minister described as an attempt to instil 'a new culture' in the banking world. The Financial Times headline on the story was: 'Icelandic women to clean up \"male mess\"'.</p> <p>'Yes,' says Halla Tomasdottir, 'but this time, after cleaning up, we're going to stay.' Tomasdottir has emerged as something of a spokeswoman for an energetic new current in favour of women occupying key leadership posts in the new Iceland that, it is hoped, will emerge from the ruins of the old. 'Before we only rowed; now we're going to decide where the boat is headed.'</p> <p>Tomasdottir has the attributes of a great captain. And today more than ever. She is the president of Audur Capital, a financial services consultancy whose clients are the only ones in Iceland not only to have not lost money in recent months, but to have made some. 'The last four years I'd been watching, incredulous, the screaming gap between the reigning model of investment and what ought to have been the sensible reality. Everything short-term, without taking into account the social consequences; betting on huge profits without seriously evaluating the risks; a shocking excess in the bonus payments to executives; and, shaping everything, a classically masculine way of doing things.'</p> <p>Women in Iceland, as elsewhere, are generally more practical than men, they have their feet more squarely on the ground and they study the consequences of the risks they take with greater diligence, says Tomasdottir, who on the week I was in Reykjavik gave a speech on the subject that was received with almost evangelical excitement by the 100 influential women present. Among them was Oddny Sturludottir, a Reykjavik city councillor, who emerged from the meeting eyes blazing. </p> <p>'We are all furious in Iceland but women especially so,' she said. 'We trusted the men at the helm and now we feel fooled, and totally convinced that if it had been women in charge we wouldn't be owing all these billions right now. They talk about the Viking model! What is the Viking model? Rapists and robbers! That's no model for the 21st century.'</p> <p>Which does not mean, as far as Tomasdottir is concerned, that it is the end of the capitalist model. 'Not at all. It's the beginning of a new improved capitalism, one that is led not by women alone - of course not - but one that is guided by a more feminine concept of life.' That consists, she explains, 'in thinking more long term, in working more as a team, and in taking into account not only the immediate profits of investors but also wider values such as the welfare of society as a whole'.</p> <p>Tomasdottir, a fashionably dressed woman of manifest dynamism and extravagant good humour, says she is excited by the challenges ahead. 'We will surprise the world!' she declares. 'We shall emerge stronger from all this and the world will imitate our example. You'll see!'</p> <p>But before then - and even she does not deny this - three or four tough years will have to elapse. There will be significant unemployment for the first time since the Icelandic economy's first stirrings at the end of the second world war; the currency will go down before it goes up; some of the country's finest brains will depart and many elderly people will forever lament the opportunity lost to enjoy their long-awaited retirement. </p> <p>'The party's over,' said the writer whose books the publishers cannot afford to print. 'I'll tell my children one day about the drunken nights of champagne excess the young bankers used to indulge in, and they'll think I'm making it up.'</p>",
  "<p>The widows of Eastwick contains witches and spells, but like its 1984 predecessor, The Witches of Eastwick, resists crossing over into the category of the paranormal. It holds on firmly to dual nationality, unlike the film version of the earlier book, which crossed over fairly crassly - but genre in books is much more flexible than in films. Or it can be, if writers care to exploit the possibility. The key is to avoid the pace of a thriller, never a problem with a prose as quietly rich as John Updike's, and a strategy adopted with success by Hilary Mantel in her splendid Beyond Black.</p> <p>In The Widows of Eastwick the three retired witches, widely separated in space, have lost husbands who were real men with their own histories, virtues and limitations, and at the same time had been magically conjured by their wives. Alexandra, for instance, cooked up her lovely husband Jim, a lean taciturn potter with a limp, from a hollowed pumpkin, a cowboy hat and 'a pinch of Western soil scraped from inside the back fender of a pick-up truck with Colorado plates'. But despite his otherworldly origins she misses the life she shared with a real man.</p> <p>The first part of the book, in which the women re-establish their connection, is by some way the weakest. First Alexandra goes on a train trip of the Canadian Rockies by herself, then she joins Jane to explore the Nile. Finally Sukie joins the other two on a package tour to China. Updike is a meticulous observer, but these pages are still too close to travelogue for comfort.</p> <p>The women find they are compatible enough to want to spend a summer together in their old haunt of Eastwick. They don't actively choose an apartment clumsily carved out of the mansion rented by Darryl Van Horne in the earlier book, but it's the only suitable one available. They are bound together more by memories, both pleasurable and guilty, than any continuing supernatural connection. Witches in Updike's version of them don't ripen in old age. Their powers are an aspect of sexuality, though unleashed by separation, and have undergone a hormonal waning. The cover of the book shows an image of a toad gazing disapprovingly from a dainty teacup. The book's own images of black magic are much homelier and less obvious. Conversation before a sabbat is likely to concern the catering - 'The Munster is delicious. The Gouda seems dry.' Alexandra creates a magic circle with granules of dishwater detergent, which has the advantage (important in rented accommodation, where there's a deposit to be reclaimed) that it can be vacuumed up without trouble after the ceremony.</p> <p>Updike's prose is barer of flourishes than the earlier volume, and has noticeably fewer art references, as if he was forswearing second-hand seeing. The writing shows no sign of waning powers - it doesn't suggest a late style, or else it always did. If there is a note of farewell, it plausibly belongs to the characters rather than the author: 'Alexandra saw that right here, in front of her, was one answer to death - her genes living on. The tussle of family life, the clumsy accommodations and forgivingness of it, the comedy of membership in a club that has to take you in at the moment of birth.' This would seem sentimental in another context but is sharpened by the knowledge that family life, in the earlier volume, was exactly what the witches, neglectful mothers and (almost) proud of it, despised.</p> <p>Of the big four of post-war American fiction (the others being Bellow, Mailer and Roth) Updike is the one who, despite his psoriasis, has always seemed most at home in his own skin and in the world. He is also the only gentile, though he exposed that difference imaginatively through the character of Henry Bech. Never mind that his Bech books were among his least successful - it was a significant attempt. In the Rabbit series he explored what it might be like to have a background like his without the creative gift. Again, there are objections to that impressive series of chronicles. It seems rather a cheat to have flooding back into every exquisite sentence the exquisiteness of perception you're supposed to be doing without.</p> <p>So Updike's imagination is stimulated by difference - except in the case of male homosexuality, which retains stubborn links for him with evil, pretence or futility. The big four were a pretty homophobic bunch on the whole, and the bisexual character on offer here is as deep as any of them managed to go. It's a small sorrow to accept that Updike in this single respect hasn't shed the assumptions of his generation.</p> <p>Philip Roth's standing is currently higher than Updike's, thanks to an Indian summer of creativity (starting with Sabbath's Theater) so intense that his books should come with complimentary sunblock. Yet Roth sees sexuality from a narrow range of angles. He struggles to show women except as the objects of desire, and it's impossible to imagine him bringing off a book, like this one and its predecessor, with women's own desires at its centre. The sexual adventures in The Widows of Eastwick are almost entirely in the past, but the memories are luminous, and it's an extraordinary achievement to show men, and their little sexualities, as if from outside.</p> <p>It counts against Updike that he doesn't reproach the world, or rail against it, but seems content to register it. At the fantastically high level at which he undertakes that registration, it is alchemy enough.</p>",
  "<p>History professor Peter Marshall has unearthed a 380-year-old ghost story and combined it with 17th-century religious conflicts, Anglo-Irish relations, and the machinations of Charles I's minions, to rather jolly effect. After her death in 1634, widow Susan Leakey kept popping up from beyond the grave to pester her family and neighbours; not unusual for the time, apparently, until she intoned something about a son-in-law in the Church of Ireland. This piqued the attentions of the privy council, whose investigation into the spectre's claim culminated in Protestant bishop John Atherton being hanged after accusations of incest, sodomy and bestiality. A wider picture of how religion and gossip have developed since emerges from Marshall's engaging presentation of this intriguing case.</p>",
  "<p>Who would disagree that the current presidential race <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/26/race-barack-obama-us-elections\">('America is showing Europe the way again'</a>, Comment, last week) is a turning point in America's political history?</p> <p>The American ideal of opportunities for all is shared and strongly supported here in Britain. Many of my heroes are from the civil rights movement of the 1960s. But as we become misty eyed looking across the pond, we shouldn't ignore what has happened here. Opportunities for black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in Britain have grown and this country has some of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in Europe.</p> <p>We may not yet have our own Barack Obama, but the number of MPs from an ethnic minority background has grown from four in 1987 to 15 now. This is not fast enough progress. But we are ensuring that the British political system is open and accessible to all. That means reinvigorating democracy and giving it relevance so that people can engage. The Queen's Speech will contain measures to give more of our citizens who are under-represented a better chance of reaching positions of power and influence.</p> <p>It could be said that the first-ever black nominee in the US presidential race is the fruits of the civil rights movement in the Sixties. In my opinion, we are already seeing the fruits in the UK of thoroughly progressive policies of the last 11 years.<br><strong>Sadiq Khan</strong><br>Minister for Cohesion and Race Equality</p> <p>Keith Richburg argues that Barack Obama's rise seems possible only in the US. I am not sure if Obama really does stand for a different country. But Richburg is right in arguing that societies in Europe still need to adapt further to increasing ethnic diversity. </p> <p>However, if you take a look at parliamentary representation you recognise progress. What I find most exciting is that the German Green party should elect Cem Ozdemir (who is of Turkish descent) as its new co-spokesperson in mid-November. I believe he would be the first guest worker's child to lead any relevant party in Europe.<br><strong>Jan Seifert</strong><br>London SE1</p> <p>This 'only in America' line is a wee bit annoying. Have Richburg and Obama, who frequently chants this mantra, not noticed that the President of Bolivia is an indigenous peasant? I'd say the chances of such a thing happening in the US any time soon are fairly remote.</p> <p>No doubt we could all do better but let's get the picture straight.<br><strong>Susan Seager</strong><br>London W6</p> <p>Keith Richburg, in asserting the value of the 'American dream', glides over a few inconvenient points.</p> <p>Dreams can be quite wonderful but they do not take place in the real world. Even if Obama gets to the White house, 46 per cent of African American children will spend this winter below the poverty line.</p> <p>He is right to point out that the multicultural project in Europe still has a long way to go, but it takes a remarkably detached American to suggest that his own country is leading the way. That American ideology seeks to reaffirm the American dream at every opportunity is hardly surprising. That knowledgeable Black Americans such as Richburg are happy to regurgitate such tripe is as baffling as it is depressing.<br><strong>Seth Dye</strong><br>Nottingham</p> <p>I agree with Keith Richburg that Barack Obama's achievement could only happen in the US, but disagree that he will be America's first black President. Obama is of mixed race and if he succeeds it will be a victory for the American dream, the melting pot and racial assimilation.<br><strong>Stan Labovitch</strong><br>Windsor</p> <h2>Write to us</h2> <p>Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday). <strong>Fax: 020 7837 7817</strong>.

  "<p>Dozens of suspected terrorists have attempted to infiltrate Britain's top laboratories in order to develop weapons of mass destruction, such as biological and nuclear devices, during the past year. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity\">security services</a>, MI5 and MI6, have intercepted up to 100 potential terrorists posing as postgraduate students who they believe tried accessing laboratories to gain the materials and expertise needed to create chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, the government has confirmed. </p> <p>It follows warnings from MI5 to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alqaida\">al-Qaeda</a>'s terror network is actively seeking to recruit scientists and university students with access to laboratories containing deadly viruses and weapons technology. </p> <p>Extensive background checks from the security services, using a new vetting scheme, have led to the rejection of overseas students who were believed to be intent on developing weapons of mass destruction. A Foreign Office spokesman said the students had been denied clearance to study in the UK under powers 'to stop the spread of knowledge and skills that could be used in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery'. </p> <p>He added: 'There is empirical evidence of a problem with postgraduate students becoming weapons proliferators.' The overseas students, a number of whom are thought to be from 'countries of concern' such as Iran and Pakistan, were intercepted under the Academic Technology Approval Scheme, introduced by universities and the security services last November. </p> <p>The findings raise questions over how many terrorist suspects may have already infiltrated the UK's laboratory network. Rihab Taha, dubbed 'Dr Germ', who worked on Saddam Hussein's biological weapons programme, studied for her PhD in plant toxins at East Anglia University's School of Biological Sciences in Norwich. </p> <p>In addition, a number of well-educated Iraqi scientists - funded by Baghdad - infiltrated several British microbiology laboratories in the run-up to the Gulf war of 1990-91. Britain has about 800 laboratories in hospitals, universities and private firms where staff have access to lethal viruses such as Ebola, polio and avian flu or could acquire the technology and expertise to develop deadly weapons. Whitehall sources remain concerned about the number of countries intent on acquiring the materials and knowledge to develop a nuclear or biological warfare capability. </p> <p>John Wood of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control said: 'Any scientist would say it's important that we know who is working in our laboratories, and also why they are working there.' </p> <p>The trial of two NHS doctors, Mohammad Asha, 27, a Jordanian national, and Bilal Abdulla, 29, from Iraq, who allegedly plotted widespread carnage through car bomb attacks in London's West End and Glasgow airport last year, has intensified scrutiny on the radicalisation of students. Named in the plot is 27-year-old Indian PhD student, Kafeel Ahmed, who drove a Jeep laden with gas canisters into Glasgow Airport's main terminal building but died several weeks later from severe burns. Ahmed studied for his PhD in the technology department of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. </p> <p>A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said the security scheme had so far proved effective. He added: 'It is important to protect the UK from people who may wish to use technology and materials here inappropriately.' </p> <p>Michael Stephens, head of security at the Medical Research Council, which runs some of Britain's most sensitive laboratories, said they took the issue of biosecurity 'extremely seriously'. </p> <p>Concern that al-Qaeda is intent on developing a more sophisticated weapons capability moved the former director-general of MI5, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, to warn publicly that terror attacks in Britain could involve weapons of mass destruction. She said: 'We know that attempts to gather materials are there, we know that attempts to gather technologies are there.' </p> <p>Extremist groups are known to have targeted students, offering to fund courses in return for using their newly acquired expertise. It is unclear if any of those denied 'clearance' to study in the UK during the past year were funded by grants from host governments such as Tehran. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said 'efforts' on scrutiny of foreign postgraduate students would continue with only a few of the 20,000 applications rejected for security reasons. In the US, draft legislation advocates banning all non-Americans from laboratories which possess potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses, a measure the UK government believes is too draconian.</p> <p>Professor George Griffin, chairman of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, has warned of the lack of a national standard required for people to work in high-security laboratories. </p> <p>The move comes as the government considers plans to build a new pathogen research facility in central London, between King's Cross station and the British Library. Experts have warned that a terror attack would prove catastrophic to the surrounding area.</p>",

  "<p>It is now 56 years since Ian Fleming's first James Bond thriller, Casino Royale, was published (Sean Connery was dancing in the chorus of South Pacific at the time) and 46 years since the first Bond movie, Dr No, opened in Piccadilly Circus (six years before the birth of Daniel Craig). Created at the same time as Hugh Hefner's Playboy and exhibiting a similar hedonistic ethos, Bond became first a derided cult, then an approved international hero as President Kennedy's favourite bedtime reading, before developing into a cultural institution and a giant commercial franchise. The five principal actors who've played Bond - Connery, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan and Craig - have in their individual personas reflected the changing times to which the series has cannily adjusted.</p> <p>The Bond business has always been a calculated Anglo-American enterprise (the Hollywood pro Richard Maibaum scripted the first 13 in collaboration with British writers). Fleming's ideal movie would have been directed by Hitchcock and starred Cary Grant. Quantum of Solace, directed by a Hollywood-based German, Marc Forster, has an original screenplay by Hollywood's Paul Haggis (Canadian-born, like the first co-producer of the Bond movies, Harry Saltzman), and two Englishmen, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, and presents itself as a sequel to Casino Royale, adapted and updated from Fleming's first novel. You may recall (the producers expect you to) that Craig's Bond ended up having the supposed love of his life killed. He's now out to avenge her death at the hands of a ruthless, amorphous international organisation (clearly a reflection of the 'war on terror') of which MI6 and the CIA know little. </p> <p>The title of the film comes from a curious Maughamesque tale told by the Governor of the Bahamas to Bond and published in the 1960 collection For Your Eyes Only. The story is about the breakdown of a colonial official's marriage in post-war Bermuda and, by his self-proclaimed 'Law of the Quantum of Solace', the governor means that which is left by way of love and friendship when all else has gone from a relationship. Bond listens and learns, and what is interesting is that his recently completed assignment in the Caribbean (the time is 1957-58) has been to destroy boats smuggling arms to Castro's guerrillas: 'If anything, his sympathies were with the rebels, but the government had a big export programme with Cuba.' So he must reluctantly go along with national policy. </p> <p>Bond is in a similar position in the new picture. In past films he's often been insubordinate, doing things his own way, but in Quantum of Solace he finds himself for the first time at odds with the CIA and MI6. He has identified as the enemy the wily, plutocratic Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) who, it transpires, is assembling a cartel of international business magnates to control the world's water supply, an echo on a global scale of Chinatown. But the British and American governments want Greene on their side, and the Foreign Secretary, no less, tells M (Judi Dench in her sixth appearance as Bond's boss) that if she doesn't pull Bond out of the field 'the Americans will put him down'.</p> <p>All this takes us into the realpolitik of le Carr\u00e9, a place of self-interest where no one is to be trusted, though perhaps the conspiratorial world of Jason Bourne is closer to the mark. The director, his cinematographer, editor and writers have set out to outdo the Bourne trilogy, and the picture sacrifices everything to maintaining a breakneck speed. The camera moves with dizzying rapidity, the cutting is frantic. Almost the only brief period of repose comes during the opening credits, which are rendered in that dreamy erotic style developed for the 007 pictures by Maurice Binder (silhouettes of naked women interwoven with undulating sand dunes) and accompanied by the worst song ever composed for a Bond flick. </p> <p>These credits appear after a violent, bone-crushing pre-credit car chase from the Italian coast to Siena and are followed by a brief torture scene and a destructive chase around the town cross-cut with the Palio. With little scene setting the action shifts to Haiti, Austria, Italy again and finally Bolivia. There are pursuits by car, boat and plane (Bond handles a Douglas DC3 transport plane with dexterity), lethal fights and climactic pyrotechnics at an elegant hotel in the Atacama desert. There is no coherence, humour, affection, reflection. Bond is accompanied by a Bolivian beauty (Olga Kurylenko), also on a revenge trip, but little is made of their relationship, and the suggestive parallels between her pursuit of a vicious general and the murder of Scarpia in a production of Tosca that Bond attends in Austria are buried in the general confusion. </p> <p>An MI6 girl, naked beneath her raincoat, meets Bond at La Paz airport and spends the night with him (though we don't see them having sex) merely so she can finish up like Shirley Eaton in Goldfinger, with crude oil standing in for gold. The nearest to an erotic moment comes when a continuously petulant M takes a phone call from a distant Bond while running her night-time bath and applying cleansing cream. </p> <p>After two feeble quips early on, Bond gives up on comedy and has neither time nor occasion to smile. What he does do is get bruised, cut, and above all he runs - up stairs, down streets, across roof-tops - as fast as Kelly Holmes and as far as Paula Radcliffe. It's a heavy-hearted film for a weary time. During a little coda in Russia it takes a deep breath and attempts a serious conclusion but merely ends up being solemn.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays Bank is paying a high price to avoid being in thrall to the UK government - and not just financially. It has tied up a deal to raise \u00a35.8bn from two sheikhs as an alternative to bolstering its capital through a Treasury-sponsored bailout, provoking the ire of its existing shareholders, who think the deal was too expensive and that they should have been given a bigger chance to participate. </p> <p>Understandably, Barclays chief executive John Varley took the view that raising capital through a rights issue would be too risky and long-winded. But that still leaves the question of why he opted for costly capital from Qatar and Abu Dhabi when he could have got his money more cheaply from Alistair Darling. </p> <p>The stock answer in the City is that Bob Diamond, the inordinately well-paid boss of Barclays Capital, did not want his bonuses brought under government control. But Diamond is a bit of a red herring: this deal is all about Roger Jenkins, Barclays' top man in the Middle East, who brokered the fund-raising. Jenkins's pay is not disclosed, but he is believed to earn at least as much as Diamond - certainly enough to support the socialite lifestyle of his wife Dijana, who is seen out with the likes of Cindy Crawford, Pamela Anderson and Mick Jagger, and who appeared in a magazine a couple of years ago sporting a \u00a36,400 mink poncho on the steps of her private jet. </p> <p>Another well-connected blonde to feature in the deal is Amanda Staveley, a former girlfriend of Prince Andrew; she first came to my attention in 2004, when she was served with a petition for bankruptcy after a dispute over money owed on a Mayfair flat, but has since reinvented herself as an adviser to the royal family of Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>Jenkins came to prominence at Barclays by devising ingenious schemes to help wealthy individuals avoid paying a penny more than they needed to in tax. Unsurprisingly, with Jenkins' background, the transaction with the sheikhs is highly tax-efficient, depriving the Treasury of an estimated \u00a3120m of revenue at a time when it needs every penny it can get. </p> <p>If Barclays - which says it is reviewing its pay and bonus structures - is pandering to wealthy executives in the teeth of the credit crunch when its personal and small business customers are struggling, then that is distasteful in the extreme. It also raises questions over who is really in charge: Varley and his chairman, Marcus Agius, or the much better paid Jenkins and Diamond? </p> <p>The bank has avoided being brought under the control of the UK government, but it has ceded a great deal of influence to sovereign investors: not just the sheikhs, but the Chinese and the Singaporeans it brought on board to support its losing bid for ABN Amro last year. </p> <p>On the plus side, this reflects the changing balance of power in the world economy, with far more clout going to oil producers and emerging markets. It might enable Barclays to win lucrative business and make valuable connections in these regions. But the onus is on Varley to show that the ransom he has paid to escape the clutches of Alistair Darling was worth it. He has a lot to prove.</p> <h2>Clear map to disaster - but no one looked at it</h2> <p>If you want a masterly analysis of how the financial crisis came about, look no further than the Bank of England's latest financial stability report. It is devastatingly clear from the FSR that the banks were, from 2004 onwards, rapidly expanding their balance sheets, ramping up their leverage and financing increasing amounts of lending through the wholesale markets, often from overseas, to bridge the funding gap as households stopped saving. The route map to disaster was clearly being drawn. So why, since it was all there in the data, was nothing done?</p> <p>As recently as the April 2007 FSR, the Bank was insisting that the UK financial system was 'highly resilient'. It did point to some fault lines, but acknowledges it did not speak out with sufficient vigour - though even if it had shouted from the rooftops, officials wonder how much effect 'open mouth operations' would have had.</p> <p>Governor Mervyn King reckons the lesson of the crisis is that there is a regulatory black hole between the supervision of individual institutions on the one hand and monetary and fiscal policy on the other. That meant risks to the system as a whole were not paid enough attention. He wants new tools to bridge the gap, possibly along the lines of those used in Spain, where banks have to store up reserves during the good times, so they have less need to raise capital in the bad.</p> <p>The reality, though, is that there was nothing to stop the Bank of England from adopting a Spanish approach. As King was fully aware, the Bank for International Settlements, which did the best job of predicting the meltdown, was advocating that sort of system. So the question for the governor is: if the Spanish managed to take pre-emptive action to save their banks, why couldn't we? And as it was so obvious the UK economy was highly vulnerable to the crunch, why wasn't the Bank cutting rates sooner?</p> <h2>Prepare for the second wave of write-offs</h2> <p>One question hanging over the economy is how corporate Britain outside the financial sector will fare. Despite the downturn, there has not been huge distress - yet - and company insolvencies are still at low levels by historical standards. But there are worrying signs. A little-noticed chart, also in the Bank of England's latest financial stability report, shows that the proportion of all corporate debt held by companies that do not make enough profit to service their interest bills shot up last year to more than a quarter of the total. That suggests a high degree of vulnerability, which is likely to increase as the slowdown intensifies. On top of that, companies have in place \u00a3160bn of loan facilities with the UK banks, which they have not used; if they choose to draw on these, it will increase lenders' exposure. So far, we have seen the damage the banks have wreaked on each other. A second wave of write-offs from defaulting companies is on its way, along with losses on mortgages, personal loans and credit cards. It would be foolish to underestimate the pain.</p>",

  "<p>It was supposed to be a triumphant homecoming for the Olympic heroes, but this weekend's track cycling world cup in Manchester threatens instead to become a showcase for the next generation of stars.</p> <p>So far, the teenagers have hijacked the show, laying down a marker not just for the future, but for the present. On Friday evening Lizzie Armitstead won the women's points race with such a mature and polished display of tactical riding that some imagined she was a seasoned pro rather than a 19-year-old from Otley who will embark on her first full professional season in Belgium next year.</p> <p>But the star of the meeting, which finishes today, seems set to be David Daniell, an 18-year old from Middlesbrough who, riding his first world cup, won gold in the kilometre time trial. Shane Sutton, the head coach at British Cycling, did not hesitate yesterday to describe Daniell as 'the new Chris Hoy'.</p> <p>'He has a good temperament, he's got a great work ethic,' said Sutton. 'He's been earmarked as a real star of the future. He has all the attributes that Chris has - the only real difference is that he's quicker than Chris was at his age.'</p> <p>Daniell has been based full-time at the Manchester Velodrome for the past year, and he will be unleashed on the rest of the world in this, his first senior season. They were not expecting him to make such an impact so soon, though, and even Hoy, who is not racing this weekend, was taken aback by his ride in the kilo on Friday. Hoy dominated this event for years, winning Olympic gold in 2004 before it was dumped from the Games programme after Athens. These days, it survives only by virtue of remaining on the programme for the world cup series and world championships. There is no question that it has lost some of its lustre - it was the final event of Friday's programme, run off at 10pm, when half the sell-out crowd had gone home - but its omission from the Olympics has been positive for young riders such as Daniell because it has been re-invented as a development event.</p> <p>Even if victory in the kilo carries less prestige than in the other sprint events, there is no questioning the quality of Daniell's winning time, which would have won him major titles 10 years ago. Hoy admitted he was impressed. 'He's a very unassuming, quiet guy who just gets on with it,' said Hoy. 'He's in the background, plodding away, but he's got something special, definitely.</p> <p>'You can't really compare different eras because of advances in equipment, but his time here [1min 01.996sec] would have won major senior championships around a decade ago. It would have got him a world championship medal seven years ago. I think only 10 people have ever gone under one minute, two seconds.'</p> <p>Speaking during sprint qualifying yesterday - in which he was second to Jason Kenny, the Olympic silver medallist in this event - Daniell admitted he had been surprised to win.</p> <p>'I thought I'd be up there but I was expecting a 1.02 - and a mid-two,' he said. 'But I changed to a higher gear and it felt good. When I saw the time, though, it was unbelievable. I couldn't believe I'd closed that gap.</p> <p>'I think it's the coaching and training,' he added when asked how he had managed to make such rapid progress. 'I'm going to stick with the kilo because it's good for developing strength, and I can add speed on top of that later. My tactical riding is a weakness when it comes to sprinting - but I can hopefully improve as I get more experience.'</p>",

True, his voice is quiet and his answers sometimes take a little while to prepare, but it is well over three decades since he won his two world titles, the first in 1972 with Lotus and then two years later with McLaren.</p> <p>Fittipaldi's conversation is constantly punctuated by 'I'm very excited', 'I love racing' and 'I'm so happy'. He does not stop talking about driving - racing a Corvette at Goodwood, driving the pace car at this year's Indy 500, his impatience to test the new Ferrari-powered A1GP machine - and answers spear off on a tangent as his passion for his sport takes over the question. Massa may be the outsider for the title, but it seems Brazil has a score to settle with Britain when it comes to the F1 drivers' championship.</p> <p>'Formula One started to be popular there in the Seventies when I joined grand prix racing, and then with Nelson [Piquet] and Ayrton [Senna] we brought eight world championships,' he says. 'Britain won 12, so we are four behind. Germany won seven with one guy. Brazil is second most successful; Britain has a lot.'</p> <p>While Massa has undoubtedly suffered from bad luck, he also put in some duff performances earlier in the season. So, if his fellow countryman wins the world championship this year... 'It would be great for Brazil,' Fittipaldi interjects quickly. But would he be a worthy champion? 'I think anybody who wins the world championship deserves it. They have to have ability, have to have talent, have to have all the circumstances behind them. The championship year is always a special one. If you look at the record book for Formula One, I would say 99 per cent of the world champions deserved it. Felipe is doing a very good year, he's been faster than Kimi [Raikkonen] most of the year. It is an incredible championship.'</p> <p>Only 99 per cent of champions? So which one per cent should not have won? 'I don't want to be a radical,' he says before a long pause and the excuse that he cannot remember all the championships. 'If you see it the other way, should Stirling Moss have been champion? Yes, but he never won. He deserved to be the world champion. Ronnie Peterson should have been; he was my team-mate - an incredible, fast driver.'</p> <p>National pride is spurring Fittipaldi into willing Massa to win, but he is somewhat in awe of Lewis Hamilton's achievements, too. 'Nobody ever do what he do in two seasons in grand prix racing,' he says, after recalling first watching him race in a Formula Three event in Germany. And Fittipaldi is one of those who disagreed with the Belgian Grand Prix stewards' decision to strip the McLaren driver of his victory at Spa - a key point in the season, which gifted Massa a win. 'In my opinion he got Kimi by surprise. I think Kimi was emotionally affected by the first manoeuvre and then he lost out on the second. He [Hamilton] was correct to overtake the way he overtook, because he already gave away a place.'</p> <p>Hamilton has come under attack from rivals over his aggressive style, with the atmosphere becoming, at times, unfriendly. Whether it is less successful drivers with sour grapes, former champions airing their grievances or simply the monotonous sound of corporate-speak, it's easy to believe there was a better class of hero back in the day - as you can guess from the genuine sadness felt at the recent death of Ferrari's 1961 world champion, Phil Hill.</p> <p>'I was talking to Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks this weekend,' Fittipaldi says. 'They were my idols and I followed their races in magazines - I had no TV. Because of the high-risk factor there used to be much more camaraderie outside of the track. Many guys got killed back then. There was a lot of respect between drivers. Now it's different, but you cannot blame the drivers now, because they never knew a different environment. They are growing up in a new environment of grand prix racing. We cannot judge them because we come from a different background. When Phil Hill passed away I was in America and all the race community were very sad. When I see Stirling Moss, you know, he's my hero, I want to help him.'</p> <p>If there's one thing Fittipaldi would like today's drivers to do it is to race cars that make them work hard - such as the new A1GP car. In addition to running his fruit farms back home and driving whatever racing cars he can climb into, Fittipaldi manages Team Brazil in a series that he describes as having the same feel as Formula One in the 1970s. 'It's funny to say, but the A1GP car is like simply the best grand prix car today,' he says. 'Same power in the engine, no electronics, the driver has to do all the driving and show his courage. It's a very tough car to drive, very fast and at the same time very sophisticated. Grand prix racing always will be grand prix racing, but for the future grand prix car they should look at the A1 car.'</p> <p>Fittipaldi will be watching the Brazilian Grand Prix this afternoon, relishing the excitement as much as he did when following the exploits of Brooks and Moss through the pages of magazines when he was a child - and probably wishing he could be out there racing, too.</p> <p>\u2022 The next round of the A1GP championship is on Sunday in China</p>",
  "<p>The crowd could sense history in the warm Florida air. They had come from miles around. The town was called Sunrise. The assembled thousands wanted to see the man who stands on the brink of being the first black president of the United States.</p> <p>Dan Bernard, 49, had brought his three young nephews and nieces. They had driven for hours. 'I wanted them to see history. I want them to look back when they are grandparents and be able to say: \"I was there\",' Bernard said.</p> <p>It was a common sentiment. Obama himself shared it. 'At this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change we need,' Obama told the cheering throng, prompting an ear-splitting level of noise. One of the most extraordinary elections ever fought has brought the American people to within two days of casting their vote. They will either elect a young, liberal black Senator from Chicago or an old, conservative war hero. Their choice will affect the entire world.</p> <p>It has been an astonishing journey. The titanic struggle has fascinated people around the globe. Most of that attention has been focused on Obama. He has brought a touch of the rock star into American politics. From Berlin to St Louis, he has appeared in front of crowds of 100,000 or more. He has raised more money than any other presidential candidate in history. His candidacy has resembled more a social movement than a political campaign. It could end by making a black American the most powerful man in the world and signal a once-in-a-generation change in America. 'He's black and he's got a Middle Eastern-sounding name. Yet the country is positioned to vote for him for president. That's enormous,' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver.</p> <p>But it is not over quite yet. The election that has spanned almost two years still has two days to run. John McCain and the Republican party remain in the race. They are behind in the polls in the battleground states, but the gap has narrowed recently. McCain has struck a fiercely populist note and he knows how to fight. All of McCain's great triumphs - in war and in politics - have come against the odds. 'Nothing is inevitable here. We never quit. We don't hide from history. We make history,' he told an enthusiastic crowd in Mentor, Ohio last week. The beaming grin on his face showed that McCain believes he can do it. But it will not be up to him. This race will be decided by tens of millions of Americans at the polls. Only then will the watching world know who will next occupy the Oval Office. They will know if the greatest election in recent history has a final twist in its tale.</p> <p>The election has already been an epic for Obama. His quest for the White House began what seemed like an age ago. In February 2007, at the 'winter meeting' of the Democratic National Committee in Washington's Hilton hotel, each Democratic hopeful gave an introductory speech to a crowd of activists. They laid out their stall. Obama's stood out only because it was so bare compared to his ribbon-draped rivals. There were no campaign placards. No badges or posters. Just a sign-up sheet and a few pens placed on a desk manned by two young volunteers. </p> <p>Yet from that humble beginning sprang one of the largest political movements since the Civil Rights era. It has been a triumph of organisation in the technology age. Utilising the internet and driven by tech-savvy young staffers, it has changed the face of American political campaigning. It has 3.1 million financial contributors. The campaign's Facebook page has 2.2 million supporters. It is set up in cyberspace and in more than 700 campaign offices in every state in America, including ones where Obama has no chance of winning. No matter. Through time and money, everyone can still contribute. And they do. Obama has raised $640m so far. That has allowed him to outspend and outgun first Hillary Clinton and now McCain. Nothing demonstrated his advantage better than his half-hour national TV advert last week. Previously only eccentric billionaires such as Ross Perot could afford that. Now Obama shrugs off such expenses, too.</p> <p>No one expected his campaign to change politics this way. As the first black American to win a major party nomination, Obama was thought likely to face an election dominated by race. Yet his candidacy changed things there, too. He ran an explicitly 'post-racial' campaign, heralding a new type of politics. Obama's rallies attract blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians. They reflect a changing American society, in which younger generations are less obsessed with race. </p> <p>'America has moved past a lot of these racial stereotypes,' said Patrick Dejour, a business consultant at the Sunrise rally. Dejour is black but married to a white woman and their children are - like Obama - of mixed race. 'That's why he's attracted so many people. We just don't see this as being about race,' Dejour said. Experts agree, and predict that will be a Democratic strength in the years to come as minorities make up a larger proportion of America's population. 'We are dealing with a country and a generation that feels that diversity is a growing part of who we are,' said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and former member of Bill Clinton's famed campaign 'War Room'. </p> <p>But Obama could not avoid the race issue altogether. Indeed, it posed the biggest threat to his campaign. When videos of Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright, giving a racially charged speech hit the internet, race became briefly central to the campaign. Everyone noticed the elephant in the room. Obama seized the issue directly. In a speech called 'A More Perfect Union', delivered in Philadelphia, he appealed for America to understand its racist past, but also to move beyond it. </p> <p>Not everyone did. In various forms - such as rumours of him being a Muslim or snide remarks at him not being a 'real' American - Obama's opponents have sought to be portray him as the Other. But it hasn't worked. 'For the most part, race has been background noise,' said Masket. Obama has consciously reached out to the white working class, which is most likely to resist electing a black man. He has done it in a conciliatory manner, as a political moderate. Thus Obama - a black liberal - is returning the Democrats to the American South. In Virginia, North Carolina and Florida, Obama is turning once fiercely red states to shades of blue. It is yet another unexpected turn in his remarkable candidacy.</p> <p>Yet none of it would have been possible without Hillary Clinton. The epic nomination battle that began in Iowa and threatened to continue to the convention floor at Denver forged Obama as a candidate. It meant his skeletons popped out of the cupboard early on. It gave him a ground organisation in each state. The debates sharpened his skills and the media wars honed his team into ruthless professionals. It also stunned pundits with the sheer size of the voter turnout, dwarfing the Republican contest. 'The biggest surprise was the scale of voting. The turnout has been simply amazing. That was the sign that things were really going to be different this time,' said Greenberg.</p> <p>The nomination fight made Obama as a politician. He stayed cool, calm and collected and so when the greatest challenge of the election - the economic crisis - hit, he was unruffled. As McCain rushed back to Washington, Obama kept his head. As America's economy started to bleed and its financial system collapsed, Obama looked more like the stuff presidents are made of. The polls decisively broke in his direction. McCain has been scrambling to catch up ever since. Yet it has taken its toll. The brutal campaign has put Obama through a physical and emotional wringer that few can imagine. 'No one really understands what its like. It's exhausting,' said two-time former Democratic presidential hopeful and Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich. But the effect on Obama was clear. Even at a distance at the rally in Florida, one could see that Obama's once youthful head of hair has become deeply flecked with grey.</p> <p>But Obama has not yet won. McCain and the Republicans are fighting hard, especially in the key state of Ohio. No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio and McCain hit the state last week in a two-day bus blitz. With him was the man who has become the last-ditch 'working man' symbol of the Republican campaign: Joe Wurzelbacher - 'Joe the Plumber'. In Mentor, Ohio, a small working-class suburb of Cleveland, Wurzelbacher was given a hero's welcome by several thousand people who crammed into Mentor High School's gym. He told them he was voting for a 'real American' in the shape of McCain. McCain was gleeful and strident: 'I have been in a lot of campaigns and I have seen momentum. I can feel the momentum in this room tonight. I can feel it. I can feel it.' </p> <p>He will need it. Obama has bitten deep into Republican territory, appealing to white-working class voters, rural voters and the 'exurbs'. Only a last-minute wave of support, or some unforeseen flaw in the opinion polls, can propel McCain over the finish line in first place. His support is vocal and numerous, but feels out of touch with changing American concerns. The campaign has portrayed Obama as a socialist, someone who will raise taxes. Or a dangerous radical who 'pals around' with terrorists. It has worked for the party's core support. 'I don't like Obama. I don't like Marxism. It is not American,' said Mark Kopan, an IT consultant who wore a T-shirt opposing anti-illegal immigration. </p> <p>But even here, inside the hall, grumbling disappointment was not hard to find. McCain's real problem has not been Obama. It has been the past eight years of Republican rule and President George W. Bush. In poll after poll, it has been obvious that Americans everywhere desperately want a change in direction. Now the cracks are starting to show in the once-formidable Republican machine that as recently as 2005 was plotting the creation of a 'permanent majority' in US politics. The cracks have spread to the McCain campaign itself, revealing a split between McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin. Their supporters have sniped at each other through anonymous leaks to reporters. The conservative right of the party has already planned a meeting later this week in rural Virginia to discuss how the party should move forward after election day. Many experts believe the Republicans face civil war. 'The next two years, maybe longer, will be a time of internal conflict and soul-searching and messiness,' said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House.</p> <p>But last week in Ohio, McCain's campaign was still planning a victory in the must-win state. 'We are going to do it the old-fashioned way. We are going to have to earn it,' said Ohio congressman Steve LaTourette. If McCain wins here, if he sweeps Mentor and the hundreds of communities in Ohio like it, he has a chance. But if he loses, Obama will be president. Everything is at stake. That is why no one is taking Ohio for granted. 'Ohio can break your heart,' said Kucinich.</p> <p>The choice Americans face on Tuesday is between the liberal versus the conservative; the warrior versus the conciliator; the old versus the young; and, finally, black versus white. On the campaign trail last week, the two sides felt starkly different. Even the town names suggested a fight between experience and optimism: Mentor versus Sunrise. The queues for Obama's event began hours before it opened and stretched for miles. There was a carnival atmosphere inside a vast stadium. For McCain, it was a school gym and the queue never left the car park. Inside, it was patriotic shouts of 'USA! USA!' McCain launched into a scathing attack, playing on the familiar themes of cutting taxes, supporting the military and boosting Joe the Plumber's working-class authenticity. Meanwhile, Obama's rhetoric soared amid talk of unity and change. His running mate, Joe Biden, introduced him with a speech that mentioned a pantheon of American political Gods: Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. </p> <p>But hubris is dangerous. The final words do not belong to any politician. They belong to American voters. Their collective decision could put a black man in the White House, or it could reject him for an ageing warrior who found his political soul-mates in the form of an Ohio plumber and a Hockey Mom. America is at the crossroads.</p>",
  "<p>Are you unable to concentrate on one thing for any length of time and yet your mind races, so undermining your performance?</p> <p>For those in the Square Mile it is hardly surprising recent events have left them similarly distracted, especially with jobs on the line.</p> <p>But now help is at hand in the form of 50-minute meditation classes aimed at stressed-out City workers. Starting on Wednesday at St Giles' Cripplegate in the Barbican, the classes, run by Vincent Baasch of consultancy The Third Factor, are the latest evidence that meditation is becoming increasingly deployed by big business to encourage better performance.</p> <p>Baasch's classes include a 15-minute history of meditation, followed by two 15-minute exercises. The focus is on breath control. 'Meditation has been big in the US for years,' said Baasch. 'The main benefit is stress release and relaxation.

  "<p>When the few shares I possess took a serious beating last week I decided to pad out the chicken intended for Sunday lunch with haricot beans to make a huge and hearty casserole. I didn't really need to, but God, did it make me feel better. It made me feel better in the same way that taking the bus home after spending far too much on a pair of shoes makes me feel better. And what's food for if not for making us feel better about life.</p> <p>In fact, I got two days' worth of eating out of that chicken. A fat free-ranger, it did us a casserole (with apples, flageolet beans and rosemary) and finally a soup (with the leftover meat removed from its bones, shredded cabbage, sourdough toasts and a trickle of olive oil). With a chicken you pretty much get what you pay for, and I often use the bones of a roast to make a pale brown stock. I have made stock from the bones of a cut-price chicken before now and all I got was the equivalent of dishwater. No amount of onions and bay leaves and carrots and peppercorns will transform the carcass of an intensively reared bird into sustaining stock. The birds are too young and their bones too thin to make the decent stock that makes soup (or a risotto) so nourishing. The stock doesn't set to a golden jelly. It has no body.</p> <p>This is the second time I have made this sweet, autumnal casserole, last time using wild rabbit, which for those of us tightening our belts are around at a good price right now. Truth be told, I don't usually mention the bunny bit until we are tucking in. Most assume white meat is chicken. Its meat is agreeable and allows a farmer's lettuces to live another day. </p> <p>There are two ways the cook of the house can deal with a financial crisis: by buying cheaper, inferior food, or making what they would normally eat go a bit further. I tend to take the second option, which I see as preferable to filling my basket with ingredients I wouldn't normally have in the house. The food tastes as good, as succulent and as rich as it normally would, but it is simply bolstered with a pillow of starch. A handful of beans, the odd potato, or maybe a larger than usual mound of accompanying vegetables are invaluable in making a little go a long way.</p> <p>Beans, root vegetables and pasta have long been used where money is tight. The rich stews of the Greek and Italian kitchen are perfect examples of how a few spicy sausages or a chunk of ham can be stretched to feed a family, and probably an extended one at that. This may well be the winter that polenta finally makes it big in this country. Nothing fills the belly like a mound of canary-coloured cornmeal. Or maybe we will finally get those beans out of their storage jars. </p> <p>The thing I love about this sort of recipe is that it has not even the remotest whiff of parsimony about it. The difference between well-made peasant cooking and a cheap chicken is that the former gives no hint that the purse strings are tight. If the recession really does start to bite there is going to be a lot more padding out to done. I had better go and replace my broken bean pot. A nice handmade one, of course. </p> <h2>A casserole of rabbit (or chicken) and apple</h2> <p>A sweet, apple-rich stew for a cool autumn evening. A piece of rabbit or chicken on the bone and a decent butcher's sausage should be enough for each person, leaving you with four pieces of meat to make a soup-stew for tomorrow. To make soup of the leftovers pull the meat off the bones then return it to the remains of the stew and slowly reheat. Make thick toast croutes to put in the bottom of your soup bowls, then ladle the thick beany soup over them. A drizzle of olive oil is a sound finishing touch. If you need more liquid then add a little stock or water as you reheat. Serves 4.</p> <p><strong>250g dried flageolet or haricot beans </strong></p> <p><strong>3 tbsp olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>8 large rabbit or chicken pieces on the bone </strong></p> <p><strong>4 decent sausages, cut into four</strong></p> <p><strong>2 medium onions</strong></p> <p><strong>400g dessert apples</strong></p> <p><strong>3 sprigs rosemary</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp flour</strong></p> <p><strong>a bay leaf or two </strong></p> <p><strong>500ml cider, stock or, at a push, water</strong></p> <p><strong>3 tbsp double cream (optional)</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp cider vinegar (or more to taste)</strong></p> <p>Soak the beans overnight in cold water. Drain and bring to the boil in fresh, unsalted water. Let them simmer for approximately 40 minutes, checking their progress now and again. How quickly they are ready will depend on the age of your beans. Drain and set aside.</p> <p>Set the oven at 190C/gas mark 5. Warm 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a shallow pan, add the rabbit or chicken pieces and the sausages and let them colour nicely on all sides. While the rabbit or chicken is cooking, peel and ...#8594; ...#8592; roughly chop the onions, core and chop the apples, and remove the rosemary needles from their stems and chop them. </p> <p>Remove the meat to a plate and add the onions to the pan, letting them soften, then introducing the apple, allowing it to colour on all sides, adding more oil if necessary. Stir in the chopped rosemary, flour, bay leaf, salt and pepper, then the cider or stock. Let the liquid bubble for a couple of minutes, stirring to dissolve any crusty bits from the pan. Stir in the drained, cooked beans. </p> <p>Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, covered with a lid. Check the meat is tender, then stir in the cream if you are using it and the cider vinegar. The sauce should be quite sweet, but if it's too much so, reduce it by stirring in more cider vinegar. Check the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, and cider vinegar as necessary. Serve in shallow bowls.</p> <h2>Apricot and orange queen of puddings</h2> <p>Of all the thrifty, nursery-style puddings that I turn to when the weather gets colder, the Queen of Puddings is met with more smiles than most. The recipe appeals particularly because of its prudent use of stale bread or cake crumbs. The traditional recipe uses lemon zest and raspberry jam and there is nothing wrong with that, but I much prefer the warm notes of orange zest and the slightly sharper apricot jam. Serves 4.</p> <p><strong>100g fresh or slightly stale white breadcrumbs</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp caster sugar</strong></p> <p><strong>finely grated zest of a small orange</strong></p> <p><strong>500ml creamy milk</strong></p> <p><strong>50g butter</strong></p> <p><strong>4 large eggs</strong></p> <p><strong>a jar of apricot jam</strong></p> <p><strong>100g caster sugar</strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Toss the breadcrumbs with the 2 tbsp caster sugar and the orange zest, then put it into a deep baking dish approximately 26cm x 22cm.</p> <p>Bring the milk and butter almost to the boil in a non-stick pan, then leave to cool briefly. Separate the eggs, then beat the yolks and pour the warm milk over them, beating all the time. Pour the mixture into the baking dish, then place in a roasting tin. Pour in enough water to come halfway up the sides of the dish. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the custard has set lightly.</p> <p>Remove the custard from the oven and take out of the roasting tin. Melt the jam in a small pan, then spoon it over the custard. Beat the egg whites till they will stand in firm peaks, then fold in the caster sugar. Pile the meringue on top of the pudding and return it to the oven for 20 minutes, till pale golden on top.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A chapter ended and two more began. Closure came with the end of the 2008 Bledisloe Cup series, won 3-1 by New Zealand thanks to a second-half performance that stood in stark contrast to their tatty first. </p> <p>The new was provided first by the fixture itself, a trans-Tasman Test shifted to the outer reaches of the South China Sea. Hong Kong now stands not just as the hub of the 7s circuit, but as a new trading post on the international scene. Might the Lions warm up here one day on their way to Australia or New Zealand? </p> <p>The other sense of fresh beginning was created by the sense of stop-off in the tropics for two teams en route to our cold northern climes. This was just an introductory match to a November of the All Blacks and the Wallabies flogging themselves around Europe. There were signs of excellence; there were moments of frailty. There were aspects to worry Europe and elements to give the old continent grounds for optimism. </p> <p>Australia had by far the better of the first half. It wasn't just that the configuration of Dan Carter at inside-centre, with Waikato's Stephen Donald at outside-half, looked like an experiment best abandoned right here and now, but also that Matt Giteau on the other side was in sublime form. And Luke Burgess as his scrum-half looks one to mark closely. </p> <p>As long as Giteau had the ball in hand, Australia looked capable of winning. As early as the sixth minute, he was taking on second-row Brad Thorn inbroken play and slipping the sweetest of passes to Drew Mitchell, who scored between the posts. In these early minutes, New Zealand had no shape beyond a vague notion to run the ball from deep. They ran into nothing but trouble and their skills suffered accordingly. Sitiveni Sivivatu's hands looked fragile, AliWilliams boomed passes into emptiness, and in general there was a totally uncharacteristic lack of precision. </p> <p>They stayed in touch because Giteau couldn't keep the ball off the floor for the whole half. At the breakdown, Richie McCaw delayed release and the rest of the forwards attacked the situation with their utterly characteristic aggression. Australia struggled to control the rucks they set up. </p> <p>And they struggled to scrape the ball back at the scrummage too. Every time there was a scrap for the ball on the floor - at the bottom of the breakdown, or the tunnel of the scrum - Australia suddenly looked anything but masters of possession. They gave away penalties, two of them kicked by Carter. </p> <p>Still, with the ball safely above ground, in their hands, Australia struck again. Ryan Cross made ground in midfield, Mitchell down his touchline, a movement building patiently until suddenly the ball started bouncing around as McCaw tackled the winger and Adam Thomson, on as a blood replacement for Rodney So'oialo, nearly ripped it clear. </p> <p>Instead it fell back into Wallaby hands, in particular - and only for a fraction of a second - into George Smith's. The wing forward gave and took in half a stride, and Mitchell was over again. </p> <p>Carter kicked a third penalty, but the threat of an All Black try was summed up by Donald's chip from a scrum in the Australian 22, a set-move that was easily covered and smothered by Burgess. </p> <p>It was the end of All Black inadequacy. In the second half, Donald stayed on long enough to see the scores levelled, Carter combining with Conrad Smith, Isiaia Toeava and finally Sivivatu in a passing movement that had an elegance and swiftness of its own. </p> <p>And then Carter took over at 10. It didn't instantly lead to total control - Toeava, for example, ran elusively one minute, only in the next to have a kick charged down in his 22 - but Australia's creativity was reduced, almost to zero. </p> <p>The winning try came when the All Blacks successfully chased a 22 restart and went all the way downfield. Carter's little grubber was collected by Ma'a Nonu - on for Donald - before Sivivatu floated a long pass out to his unmarked captain. </p> <p>There was still a chance for Giteau to create something out of that near-zero, slipping another beauty of a pass out of the tackle to Mitchell. Carter was covering and bundled him into touch. </p> <p>When play went the other way, to Peter Hynes on the right, he was tackled and nobody on his side arrived for a good four seconds. In the tropics, the Wallabies had come to a standstill. </p> <p>So, on they both come, heading our way, the All Blacks on a grand-slam mission around the home unions, Australia hoping to bounce back, first in Padua against Italy. Both will be better for this ground-breaking game under their belts; both look some way off unbeatable. </p> <p><strong>Hong Kong Stadium:</strong>39,682<br><strong>Referee</strong>Alan Lewis (Ireland)</p> <p><strong>Australia:</strong>Ashley-Cooper, Hynes, Cross (Barnes 53), Mortlock (capt), Mitchell; Giteau, Burgess; Robinson, Moore, Baxter (Dunning 71), Chisholm, Sharpe (Waugh 65), Mumm, G Smith (Pocock 74), Brown<br><strong>Tries:</strong> Mitchell 2 <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Giteau 2</p> <p><strong>New Zealand:</strong>Toeava (Jane 75), Gear, C Smith, Carter, Sivivatu; Donald (Nonu 49), Cowan (Weepu 51); Woodcock, Hore (Mealamu 5), Tialata (Somerville 65), Thorn (Boric 65), Williams, Kaino (Thomson 72),<br>McCaw (capt), So'oialo<br><strong>Tries:</strong> Sivivatu, McCaw <br><strong>Pens:</strong> Carter 3</p>",
  "<p>The last question England had to answer about their rugby went along the lines of: are you lot any good in bed? Trying to duck this very probe, England were pursued from Auckland to Christchurch and all the way home last June, and the fact that they were thumped in two Tests by the All Blacks rather went by the board. </p> <p>The question now is different and, dare it be said, slightly less interesting, depending on your appetite for salaciousness: are you lot any good on the field? It is certainly the question being asked by the person who managed to stay well away from the Auckland orgy by dint of being at the delivery rather than the inception end of the human reproductive process. That is, Martin Johnson, who put off until 1 July the starting date of his new role as head of England, because his wife Kay was about to go into labour. </p> <p>Johnson is now four months into his job as father of the England rugby family and the sharp end is suddenly prodding him and his Elite Player Squad. Rugby takes over from the riot act as reading material. </p> <p>The November schedule could scarcely be more demanding for England. On successive Saturdays they face the Pacific Islands, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. It's a punishing programme softened by home advantage for each fixture, and that the timetable for New Zealand and Australia is even more testing. </p> <p>They have just played each other in Hong Kong en route to Europe, where they will remain until after the first weekend in December, with matches every Saturday. Without wishing to ignore the threat of scandal - the All Blacks have been known to tumble into a honeytrap or two - bed for the incoming tourists is likely to see no action more energetic than unconsciousness.</p> <p>Rather more aerobic will be the inquest into each and every one of England's performances. It will be no laughing matter, not because there is no prospect of England doing well, but because they have entered a period of post-tabloid inscrutability. I suspect the great Johnson brow will go unironed for a month. </p> <p>His captain for this autumn campaign is Steve Borthwick, who was rendered even more profoundly grave than usual by being the leader of England in New Zealand. The second row, for whom scandal used to be mishearing a line-out call, had to steer his hapless side around an NZ police investigation that never built into anything official and past a red-top storm that was never anything but SHOCKING. Borthwick did not exactly overwhelm his inquisitors with wit, but he emerged from what must have been an uncomfortable experience with dignity relatively unbruised. </p> <p>If you throw into the mix of voices likely to be heard at team meetings that of assistant coach John Wells, he who deals with the forwards, then solemnity may be the tone of Twickenham. This is truly a time of autumnal hues. </p> <p>The timbre contrasts with the style to be adopted, or at least attempted. Johnson has spoken of a liberated England, a more daring England. This is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the times, this protocol/ELV age of quickened rhythms and even faster whistles. </p> <p>The experimental law variations have emerged, like Borthwick, unbruised after a rough baptism. The first few weeks of the season had the ball booted back and forth from full-back to full-back as the tackle area, in accordance with the protocol from the International Rugby Board to referees, became a zone of zero tolerance. The ping-pong and the protocol have calmed down and rugby is back up and running.</p> <p>So, England under Johnson are going to play a bit. They have a nice warm-up encounter with the Pacific Islanders to score lots of points. They will leak a few, I expect, but these are the early days of a World Cycle and Tonga, Fiji and Samoa will be in a carefree, careless mood: score lots, concede even more. </p> <p>England's front five will be solid enough to absorb the stress of a game behind still far from perfect. Props Matt Stevens and Andrew Sheridan are monsters on any stage and, if they can gel with, or tame even, the wilder style of Dylan Hartley at hooker, England will have the near-perfect combination of strength and dynamism from their front row. It is the one area that opponents will look at and say to themselves: 'Might be best to stay clear of that bunch.' </p> <p>Unless it is to give Hartley a little dig, to see how he reacts. The son of Waikato will have his inner calm, born of anger-management courses, put through a series of practical trials. The hooker could provide the light relief of the month, if only as an exercise in resisting his own instincts. If he beats his personal demons, he could become the player of the month. </p> <p>There is a risk like Hartley and there is a risk like Nick Kennedy in the second row. The London Irishman is a long, slender athlete, excellent on his own ball, a menace to opponents on theirs. I would give him a go alongside the captain, but when it comes to second-row selections I bow to Johnson and he might settle at first for the more heavyweight Simon Shaw or Tom Palmer. </p> <p>In the back row there are problems. James Haskell, by all accounts, is not in the form of his life. So, he may not make it at 6 or 8, which means a back row of Tom Rees, Tom Croft and Nick Easter is two-thirds young and, in Easter's case, one third recalled after demotion. Not many back-rows frighten the life out of the All Blacks and England's may cause them fewer fevers than most.</p> <p>Danny Care, on the other hand, is in scintillating form for Harlequins, at ease on the knife-edge between feisty aggression and thoughtfulness at scrum-half. Outside him I'd go for Toby Flood, who blows hot then cold, it seems, as he settles in at Leicester. The case for playing Danny Cipriani at outside-half - he simply must play somewhere - is fractured by the need for a full-back in the absence of just about everybody originally selected at 15. It's tough on Delon Armitage, but Cipriani must play. </p> <p>In the centre, there would have been at automatic place for Riki Flutey, now that the Kiwi qualifies through residency, had he not suddenly found himself in a Wasps team floundering in attack and defence in all competitions. Still, he might make it, a bit of daring to complement the yeoman qualities of Jamie Noon, who offers common sense and considerable clout. </p> <p>On the wings, Paul Sackey has become something - despite the same Wasps connection as Flutey - of a name to write down in ink before the head-scratching begins in other positions. So, down he goes, with the rather more unknown quantity Ugo Monye of Harlequins on the other wing. Monye runs well, and tackles even harder, and his club - as opposed to the Wasps connection - deserve a representation on current form. </p> <p>It's a ferocious month of rugby ahead. By the end of it, England will have lost some and won some. Some will have played their way ahead and some will be dropped. My guess is that Martin Johnson will wear a flicker of a smile and yet still bear some of those old furrows on his brow. </p> <h2>Autumn Internationals</h2> <p><strong>8 Nov</strong></p> <p>England v Pacific Islands, 2.30<br>Ireland v Canada, 5.15<br>Scotland v New Zealand, 5.15<br>Wales v South Africa, 2.30</p> <p><strong>14 Nov</strong></p> <p>Wales v Canada, 7.30</p> <p><strong>15 Nov</strong></p> <p>England v Australia, 2.30<br>Ireland v New Zealand, 5.15<br>Scotland v South Africa, 2.30</p> <p><strong>22 Nov</strong></p> <p>England v South Africa, 2.30<br>Ireland v Argentina, 2.45<br>Scotland v Canada, 2.45<br>Wales v New Zealand, 5.15</p> <p><strong>29 Nov</strong></p> <p>England v New Zealand, 2.30<br>Wales v Australia, 2.30</p>",
  "<p>A Northern Ireland MP is asking Parliament to oppose the appointment of a senior lawyer to the UN's International Court of Justice because he provided legal backing for the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>SDLP leader Mark Durkan has tabled a motion in the House of Commons urging MPs to persuade Downing Street not to back the appointment of Professor Christopher Greenwood to the UN body.</p> <p>Greenwood gave legal opinion to the then Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, in the run-up to the Iraq war. The professor's opinion ran contrary to the legal advice that the Attorney General was receiving from the Foreign Office, which had expressed doubts about the legality of invading Iraq based on UN resolution 1441.</p> <p>The London School of Economics academic is understood to have argued that the two original resolutions passed against Saddam Hussein after the Kuwait war of 1990 provided a basis for action in 2003, an assessment that critics said was a minority legal view. Durkan said it was 'regrettable that the British government is promoting Professor Greenwood' to be elected as Judge of the International Court of Justice. </p> <p>The Foyle MP added: 'After all it is worth remembering his contribution to the government's false assertion that military attack on Iraq in 2003 [was legal]. He provided the government and Parliament with the flawed and untenable argument that war with Iraq was justified on the grounds that the UN Security Council had authorised the use of force. </p> <p>'In reality, the Security Council rejected the \"second resolution\" proposed by the United States and United Kingdom. Furthermore, it is concerning that Professor Greenwood is widely identified with the questionable doctrine of \"pre-emptive self-defence\" and with the contrivance of \"continuing authority\" relying on previous UN resolutions, which did not authorise the use of force.</p> <p>'Therefore, it would be particularly inappropriate for the UN General Assembly and Security Council to elect to the International Court of Justice a candidate with such a questionable record on fundamentals of international law and the responsibilities and reputation of the United Nations.'</p> <p>Durkan's motion calls on Britain to stop using its diplomatic influence to win support for Greenwood's nomination.</p>",
  "<p><strong>This is War! Robert Capa at Work/Gerda Taro: A Retrospective<br>Barbican, London EC2, until 25 Jan</strong></p> <p>In 1938, Picture Post magazine published a selection of <strong>Robert Capa</strong>'s dramatic photographs of the Spanish Civil War. On the cover, instead of an image of fighting or wounded soldiers, they featured a portrait of Capa peering intently though the lens of a camera. It was accompanied by the headline 'The Greatest War Photographer in the World'. </p> <p>One could say that this was a decisive moment in the history of photographic reportage, when, as Susan Sontag later put it: 'War photographers inherited what glamour going to war still has among the anti-bellicose, especially when the war was felt to be one of those rare conflicts in which someone of conscience would be impelled to take sides.' </p> <p>Capa's powerful images of the fighting in Spain, often taken at considerable risk, and his blurred but brilliantly evocative images of American soldiers landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day, seem restrained when set against the images of carnage and atrocity that would become the defining feature of war reportage in Vietnam, Nicaragua and Bosnia. </p> <p>Yet, in an age when everyone with a mobile phone can be a witness, and countless images of atrocity have all but inured us to the human suffering that they are meant to convey, Capa's images of war somehow retain their power, maybe because of their peculiar intimacy. You feel, when you look at his shot of a line of militiaman, kneeling with rifles aimed, that Capa was right there, on the edge of that line, in full view of snipers on the opposing side. </p> <p>Likewise, in his photographs of wounded or exhausted Republican soldiers, there is the sense that he is with them, in every sense of the word, and that he has somehow earned his right to stalk them with his Leica. 'If your pictures aren't good enough,' he once declared, 'you're not close enough.' </p> <p>At the centre of the Barbican's intriguing exhibition, This Is War!, is Capa's most problematic photograph, 'Death of a Loyalist Militiaman, Cerro Muriano (Cord\u00f3ba front)'. That single image, of a man toppling backwards, apparently hit by a bullet, so defined the Spanish Civil War that it became known simply as 'The Falling Soldier'. Of late, though, the authenticity of the photograph has been contested and, in the catalogue for the exhibition, Capa's biographer, Richard Whelan, doggedly details the debate over whether the photograph was staged or not. He concludes that Capa was photographing soldiers 'fooling around' for the camera when a sniper killed Federico Borrell Garcia, who 'stood up for what was intended to be a heroic portrait'. Ironically, 'The Falling Soldier' remains a defining image: all the moral complexities of war photography and, in particular, its depiction of heroism, are contained in this single dramatic shot. </p> <p><strong>Gerda Taro</strong> was almost certainly present when the photograph was taken. Born Gerda Pohorylle to Polish Jewish parents in Germany, she met the young Capa, then called Andr\u00e9 Friedmann, in Paris in 1934. Both had fled oppression, he from the Hungarian secret police, she from the Nazis in her native Germany. They became lovers and she travelled with him to Spain in 1936. There, often at Capa's side, and shooting the same subject matter, she came into her own as a photojournalist. </p> <p>Like Lee Miller, Taro often mesmerised the soldiers she worked among with her beauty and seems to have worked incredibly hard to prove her bravery, often shooting continuously in the heat of battle. Because Capa and Taro worked together, and many of their prints were stamped with both their names, there have long been problems of attribution surrounding her work. This show collects images that were belatedly identified as hers by Capa's brother, Cornell, who diligently sifted though their archives and donated her prints and negatives to the Institute of Contemporary Photography in New York. Her early images of the Spanish Civil War, taken in and around Barcelona in the summer of 1936, when the revolutionary left were in control of the streets and mobilising women and children, are celebratory and uplifting. Often, when she shoots women volunteers training or marching, the results possess an almost Soviet formalism. When she went out on the streets, though, she caught the collective energy of that brief, optimistic moment, and, as historian Irme Schaber notes in her informative catalogue introduction, Taro was brilliant at 'distilling complex events into single images'.</p> <p>Those early heroic images contrast dramatically with Taro's reportage of Republican soldiers moving though the bombed streets of Madrid or in action at the Cord\u00f3ba front, which have all the immediacy and intimacy of great photojournalism. Her eye for detail is telling: in one shot, a stray dog accompanies a ragged foot patrol along a rubble-strewn street; in another, a Republican fighter paints a hammer and sickle on the wall of a commandeered room.</p> <p>Taro's brilliant images of the battle for Brunete, a town on the front line, finally earned her a reputation as a war photographer in her own right and she returned there in July 1937. During the Republican retreat, her vehicle was struck by a tank and she died soon after of her injuries. She was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery 'as a daughter of Paris' on 1 August, which would have been her 27th birthday. Her funeral procession was attended by tens of thousands of mourners and Giacometti carved her headstone. </p> <p>For a time, Taro was canonised by the left as a martyred heroine and has entered posterity as the first woman photographer to be killed in a war. But, as Capa's reputation grew, she was almost forgotten, often portrayed simply as a footnote in his great adventure. This illuminating exhibition offers a long-overdue reappraisal of her work and the radical life that underpinned it.</p>",
  "<p>With this short, lively and exceedingly timely book, Margaret Atwood has written what might be described as an intellectual history of debt. There are no Alvin Hall-style tips for getting out of financial difficulty, and those looking for insights into the causes of our current economic predicament will be disappointed. Atwood's focus, instead, is on debt as a 'human construct' - or, to put it another way, debt as an idea. Not surprisingly, given her day job as a novelist, she peppers her argument with copious examples from literature, dipping into texts ranging from Aeschylus's The Eumenides to Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. The end result is not so much a single argument as a compendium of mini-essays on the various ways that debt has been thought about through the ages.</p> <p>Debt is certainly a good subject for a survey of this sort. For one thing, it's a topic that rarely gets tackled by anyone other than economists and personal finance gurus, so the territory is wide open. For another, the concept of debt is, when you think about it, amazingly broad in its reach. Understood at the most basic level, a debt has nothing to do with money; it is simply something that is owed. And all sorts of things can be owed, both material and non-material. We can be indebted to someone for their love and friendship, or we can be indebted to them for the cup of sugar they brought round the other day. Equally, we can incur debts for wrongdoing. If I hurt my friend then it is reasonable for him to expect me to make up for that hurt. If I don't then he may consider it his right to do me an injury in return. (This is the principle of revenge, to which Atwood devotes several pages.) Almost every human interaction carries with it a metaphorical balance sheet, an implied burden of obligation and reward. Debt, understood this way, is inseparable from the business of life. </p> <p>Moreover, the concept of debt underpins many of society's most important belief systems, most obviously the law, morality and religion. Our notions of justice and punishment are predicated on the idea that those who break the law owe society a debt, which they must make good either with a monetary payment - a fine - or by means of some other penalty, such as a prison sentence. Morality, too, is at root a system of debt, although this time the entity you owe payment to - the creditor - is not society but God. </p> <p>The Christian narrative can likewise be viewed through the prism of debt, with God figuring as a kind of benign banker. He has given us something of incalculable value - life - and, if we play by His rules and make our (moral) repayments on time, we'll be allowed to hold on to it for ever. By the same token, the Devil can be seen as a malevolent creditor, tempting us with material benefits (wealth, sex, power) in exchange for our long-term spiritual health. It is no surprise that in literature the Devil is often portrayed as a lawyer or accountant, totting up the debts (or, in the Faust legend, souls) owed to him in a ledger. </p> <p>In Payback, Atwood touches on all these themes and many more besides. The book began life as a lecture series, which perhaps explains its ultra-chatty style ('I'd like to make one of those Star Trek-ish hyperdrive leaps in time and space') and somewhat hyperactive structure. Atwood clearly isn't bothered about coming across as a know-it-all, and the knowledge she displays is formidable. In the course of a couple of pages, for example, she connects the results of a 1970s computer simulation program with a character in a Victorian children's book, and then darts off to ancient Assyria to discuss the origins of a zodiac sign. (It all just about makes sense.) She appears to have read the whole of Western literature and to be an authority on ancient languages. At one point she even makes a foray into animal anthropology, citing a study of capuchin monkeys which, she claims, demonstrates that a rudimentary grasp of debt exists in primates.</p> <p>Such wide-ranging knowledge has its drawbacks, however. Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't always give herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic. The result is that, although Payback is packed with information, it can seem oddly thin. There is a suspicion that Atwood's erudition has a defensive quality, that it is a way to avoid engaging with real argument. Moreover, when someone appears so well-versed in so many areas (and so keen to impress this fact upon you), it becomes harder to forgive them when gaps do appear. In her discussion of the concept of legal debt, for example, Atwood appears unaware that many early legal systems were based on making cash payments for crimes. The idea of 'paying your debts to society', which she spends some time puzzling over, becomes less mysterious when understood in this light. </p> <p>Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for her subject and lively style go a long way toward making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a gift for summing up an idea with a single vivid image. She points out the fundamental ridiculousness of the self-help idea of 'owing it to yourself', since it casts you as your 'own creditor and debtor rolled into one'. Elsewhere, she memorably describes Hell as being 'like an infernal maxed-out credit card that multiplies the charges endlessly'.</p> <p>And the topic itself is so endlessly interesting that it is hard not to be carried along. Although Atwood doesn't make a big show of the fact, many of her discussions are highly relevant to current events. She probes the relationship between debt and evil, for example, with a brilliant account of the various Devil-as-creditor characters in literature. The most famous is, of course, Mephistopheles, and Atwood, with her usual erudition, describes not just the Marlowe and Goethe versions of the Faust myth but also a less celebrated 19th-century retelling by Washington Irving. What emerges is how malleable the legend is, how easily it can be re-cast according to the values of any era - including our own. It wouldn't require too much of a leap, for example, to see the modern-day sub-prime creditor as yet another Mephistopheles, tempting us with gaudy fantasies of earthly riches. Unlike his predecessors, though, this Mephistopheles wouldn't be interested in your soul: he'd be after your house. </p> <p>Atwood's discussion of the connection between evil and debt leads, in turn, to another pertinent question - that of blame. Who, she asks, bears most of the blame for debt: the lender or the debtor? As she points out, in different times and in different places the balance has shifted. The idea that being in debt is sinful has deep roots in Christianity - as indicated by the existence of debtors' prisons. But Atwood points out that moneylenders have most often been made scapegoats for financial turmoil, and it is by no means only the Jews who have suffered in this respect. This is something that we should bear in mind before we become too pious in our condemnation of City bankers. </p> <p>Atwood rounds things off by moving from finance into more wishy-washy territory. She ends the book with a modern-day retelling of Scrooge, which concludes with a banal vision of ecological redemption. It is by no means the highlight of the book but that doesn't mean its message has no value. At a time when so many of us are mired in debts of the financial variety it is worth remembering that it is the other, non-financial debts that we owe - to the planet, and to each other - that may prove most important. </p> <h2>IOU: Literary debtors</h2> <p><strong>The Merchant of Venice </strong>William Shakespeare<br>When the merchant Antonio fails to make good a debt to Shylock, the latter demands repayment in the form of a pound of flesh.</p> <p><strong>Little Dorrit </strong>Charles Dickens<br>The Marshalsea debtors' prison is the setting for Dickens's satire on the shortcomings of society. </p> <p><strong>Madame Bovary </strong>Gustave Flaubert<br>Flaubert's heroine has two vices: adultery and shopping on credit. </p> <p><strong>The Mill on the Floss </strong>George Eliot <br>Tom and Maggie Tulliver are left with crippling debts following the legal disputes pursued by their father. </p> <p><strong>Death of a Salesman </strong>Arthur Miller<br>Salesman Willy Loman's dreams of success for his family come to nothing as he is driven to borrowing money from his neighbour.</p>",
  "<p>Is there such a thing as a 'win-win' situation? Journalistic cynicism says no. What the phrase usually means is that some people get more than they deserve and others get less - but not so little that they scream blue murder. The big puzzle about the 'ground-breaking settlement' announced last week between Google and its legal opponents, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers, is whether it really is - as all parties claim - a victory for everyone.</p> <p>Four years ago, Google embarked on a stupendous project to make digital copies of some of the world's largest university library collections and incorporate the texts into its vast web index. The goal was to enable anyone, anywhere, to tap into huge academic libraries, some with texts dating back centuries.</p> <p>Google signed up four major universities - Stanford, Harvard, Oxford and the University of Michigan - plus the New York Public Library - as partners in the programme, estimating it would take six years to scan and index more than 10 million books and periodicals. At Stanford, Harvard and Oxford, it agreed to scan only samples (albeit large ones), but at Michigan they did every book and periodical, partly because Google co-founder Larry Page is a graduate, and partly because Michigan has one of the best university collections in the US.</p> <p>It's a staggering project costing about $10 per volume scanned, and one that was thought to be impractical, until Google embarked on it. 'Going as fast as we can with the traditional means of doing this,' said John Wilkin of the University of Michigan in 2004, 'it would take us about 1,600 years to do all seven million volumes. Google will do it in six years. If we were to do this job ourselves, it would probably cost $600m- that's just the human cost of preparing the material for scanning, packing it up and sending it out to vendors and then quality-control checking of the results. Nothing has been conceived on this scale. It's access to a research collection we never would have dared imagine possible.'</p> <p>Enter, stage right, US book publishers, many of them incensed by Google's presumptions. Who did these techies think they were, casually scanning and indexing other people's texts? Google responded that (a) copyright holders were protected because when searchers found a book under copyright, they would see only a catalogue-type entry providing basic information about the book and a few sentences of text surrounding the search term, and (b) scanning and indexing constituted 'fair use' under US copyright law.</p> <p>Pshaw! said the publishers (and the Authors Guild) and called m'learned friends. It would have made an interesting trial and probably have gone all the way to the Supreme Court. But last week the parties reached a deal in which Google will pay $125m to settle the lawsuits, thus clearing the way for it to make millions of out-of-print books available for reading and purchasing online. The deal also outlines a framework for a new system that will channel payments from book sales, advertising revenue and other fees to authors and publishers, with Google taking a cut.</p> <p>This is a big deal. Of the seven million books Google has scanned so far, between four and five million are still in copyright but out of print. Any arrangement making those easier to access has to be good news. Google can display up to 20 per cent of the text free of charge and make the entire book available online for a fee. The company will take 37 per cent of the resulting revenues, leaving 63 per cent for publishers and authors. (So authors can earn revenues from works their publishers have declined to reprint. Imagine what would have happened to the music business if record labels had negotiated a deal like this.) And if Google sells ads on texts it displays, it will split the revenues on the same basis. It gets all this for $125m, the smallest of small change to a corporation with annual revenues touching $20bn.</p> <p>The most significant aspect of the deal, though, is that universities, libraries and other organisations will be able to buy subscriptions that make entire collections of those books available to their visitors. Governments could buy national subscriptions for all the public libraries in their jurisdictions. We've taken a giant step towards a world that once seemed an unattainable dream - where everything that has ever been published can be available to anyone who has the desire to read it.</p> <p>And the downside? Google becomes the conduit for everything in print and pays peanuts for the privilege. Heads it wins, tails it wins.<br><a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\"><br>john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Where would modern cinema be without Guy Maddin? Certainly not in Winnipeg, a place of somnambulist enchantment in which householders are required by law to provide shelter for sleepwalkers and horses stampede from infernos to freezing rivers where they become ice sculptures, their rampant heads serving as park benches for the curious locals. </p> <p>Rumour has it that this otherworldly escapade - a 'docu-fantasia' in colourful black and white - was commissioned by the city fathers as a down-the-line celebration of their beloved home. The narrative tone is sonorously 'factual', yet how much of this alternative history should we believe? Did the town really embrace a long-running soap opera entitled Ledge Man, in which Maddin's mother (played here by Forties B-movie star Ann Savage) would talk some suicidal desperado down from a high window every episode? Is there really a surreptitious taxi trade serving backroads and alleyways that do not appear on any maps, crisscrossing the city over a maze of hidden rivers through which the true blood of the locals flows?</p> <p>Who knows? Certainly not this viewer who opted simply to believe in Maddin's magical world in the same way that I 'believed' in films like Tales From the Gimli Hospital or The Saddest Music in the World. Fans of early David Lynch will find a kindred spirit in Maddin's surreal monochrome vision, while his infatuation with the archaic mechanics of early cinema yields peculiarly modern dividends.</p> <p>By strange coincidence, My Winnipeg also serves as an eerie companion piece to Terence Davies's enrapturing Of Time and the City, a similarly personal account of his home town which could easily have been called 'My Liverpool'.</p> <p>Oh, and did I mention that it's poignant, truthful and hilarious? That much, at least, you can take as fact.</p>",
  "<p>The images of Helena Christensen in the orgiastic new Agent Provocateur ads sent a bolt of longing through my body. But the desire was not for her lingerie or her lovely pirate ship festooned with decoratively erotic friends, or Helena herself, or even for a jolly roger thereof. The longing was for the not-so-distant past when women's underwear was furtive, secret and confined to small discreet shops and the corners of department stores where men feared to tread.</p> <p>Nowadays this faux-pornography is plastered all over magazines and newspapers, but I can remember a time that the best it got was the pages of the Freemans mail-order catalogue. In those days, lingerie was mostly white, gusseted and with a vaguely virginal or medical feel. It did enough to give my overactive prepubescent libido a sturdy jolt, but it was pretty obvious that sexual provocation was fairly low on the priorities of whoever designed the stuff. </p> <p>Now that I think of it, the Freemans experience is not my first memory of women's lingerie (and by definition, it is women's, isn't it? Or can there be men's lingerie?). My earliest recollection - I imagine - is more or less universal for males. That buried image is of my mother in her underwear. Each man has this imprint of his partly clad nurturer, protector and saviour buried somewhere in his subconscious and it survives, I think, from deepest childhood right into the last flaggings of late adulthood (and I speak from the perspective of that late flagging). </p> <p>This is presumably why women's underwear maintains such an erotic charge. Certainly, if you are a Freudian, it is a no-brainer. But even if you aren't, the subliminal confusion between the mature female form, lingerie, your infantile experience of it as window dressing for forbidden patches of female skin, and your own sexuality is worth examining. But I will return to this topic after I have divested myself of a particularly disturbing image that writing this article has dredged up.</p> <p>I do so hope this is normal. I remember when I was 10 or 11 dressing up in my mother's Playtex, and parading in front of the mirror thinking, well, how very attractive I looked. How sexy, in fact. I didn't directly connect it with my mother. I didn't even directly connect it with sex. But I did think it was strange and perverse and vaguely exciting. Lingerie clearly had transformative powers. Perhaps that's why it was rarely designed to be purely functional - always a bit of embroidery here, a frill there, an unexpected dash of colour somewhere else. It was possessed of the magical markings of a talisman.</p> <p>Flash forward seven or eight years from the sexually confused 10-year-old boy, who has finally and enthusiastically lost his virginity (and his brief interest in what appears to have been incipient transvestitism). During this time he has had a number of encounters with girls' underwear, but it has always been combative rather than erotically charged. Getting those damn bras undone. Finding your way into those ridiculously ample 1970s knickers through industrial-grade elastic. Aesthetics didn't come into it. Lingerie was just an obstacle to getting a girl nekkid. </p> <p>However, once sex became an actuality rather than a fantasy, fantasy could actually be applied to the actuality. Not that this occurred to me at first. In those days, the sexual ritual still remained largely about getting access to as much female skin as possible without obstruction. The scanty strips of restricting cotton (if you were lucky; in Seventies suburbia it was often nylon or worse) under her dress, hot pants or bib and braces just got in the way. Also the underwear carried other discouraging news - sometimes in the form of faint, less-than-floral odours and sometimes through the glimpse of disfiguring marks that were visible proof that women weren't as pure and perfect as we were still, in that era, being led to believe they were.</p> <p>But it wasn't long of course before the appeal of simple nudity wore off a bit. It was then that the old French maid's uniform started to put in an appearance. Not the frilly hat and duster and all that palaver, but the standard kit - black stockings and suspenders. As a man, I had no idea where the erotic charge of these precious, provocative items came from, but they certainly carried a hefty one, especially when combined with other fetish gear. I was rather grateful for the fashion for chokers then. Never were sex and death so blatantly linked.</p> <p>It seemed clear that maternal imprinting, though, wasn't the cause of this black-stockings- and-suspenders fetish - to my conscious knowledge, which admittedly is partial, I never clocked my mum walking around done up like Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour (thank God, or I might have been strutting around on the stage at Madame JoJo's to this day). </p> <p>Nowadays, the whole stockings/suspenders performance is so worn out with clich\u00e9 that it is hard to maintain one's enthusiasm. Not so back then. For some reason the blackness, the gappiness, the suggestion of suspension and stretching, of some kind of a fleshy parcel struggling to break free of its limits, seemed unutterably powerful. You could keep your cut-out nipple bras (they were still a novelty then) your split-crotch panties (ditto) and even your pastel-coloured baby-doll nightie (which I swear was still in use then, at least outside of the North Circular). In the limited menu of erotic underwear of the time, the black S-and-S outfit trumped them all. But why? </p> <p>My instinctive answer in those days would have been 'who cares' but more mature reflection demands to know why this staple of erotica has so singularly continued (check out the Agent Provocateur photographs again, and it is obvious that even today they remain the quotidian, the lingua erotica of undergarments). It must be to do with partial concealment and with confinement, though again, I don't know why that should be so attractive. John Updike said that 'the most beautiful thing most men will ever see is a naked woman's body'. I think he fell short of the mark. The most beautiful thing most men will see is a naked woman's body imperfectly concealed. </p> <p>There are theories about this. As far as I can work out, the coming of age of the stocking/suspender fetish came along with Marlene Dietrich playing Lola Frohlich in The Blue Angel in 1930. The Blue Angel, I read recently in an academic tome by Martha McCaughey and Neal King, 'set the standard for accentuating the props used in erotic performance. In her top hat, lingering, exposed garter belts, black stockings ... Lola personifies the fetishised woman.' It goes on to say that this attraction is rooted in Freudian theory, 'which posits that the erotic display of women is influenced by the male viewer's horrific boyhood discovery of his mother's lack of a penis'. </p> <p>Back to my personal history of women's undergarments. After those first, brief heady days of erotic intoxication, I narrowly missed a women's lingerie revolution. Ann Summers was taking off big time - Tupperware parties that flogged corsets, vibrators and garter belts instead of boxes to keep your bacon cooled. Unfortunately by the time I had moved on from my first girlfriend and was starting to play, as it was misogynistically called those days, 'the field', I bumped into the fustian of pre-Madonna 1980s sexual politics. I was upwardly mobile, I was a liberal, I was a leftie and so were the women I hung out with. And that meant only one thing. No bloody lingerie. </p> <p>Obviously they still wore it (though not always - the lack of a bra was a mark of pride for many). But Ann Summers was seen as naff, cheap and worse, sexually exploitative and demeaning to women. In fact, as I recall, just about everything was demeaning to women in those days. Certain sexual positions were demeaning (doggy-style was a complete non-starter in the parts of north London I was hanging out in), page-three girls were demeaning, Helmut Newton was demeaning, and underwear that did anything other than contain bodily excretions and confine glands effectively were considered not only superfluous but offensive.</p> <p>I didn't really mind, but it seemed a shame to let so much colour and richness of texture depart the inner world of sex. All those Doc Martens, boiler suits and white-cotton underpants had a certain homoerotic quality, but I'm not sure, despite my early cross-dressing experiment, that my homoeroticism went deep enough to compensate me for the lack of something provocative. I still longed for items that I could imagine to be transgressive, that advertised a woman's sexual enthusiasm and, yes, availability, rather than the relentless neutered indifference of the bra and panties of the 1980s. </p> <p>The dreams of a million men came true with the arrival of Madonna, determined to show a strong woman in control of her sexuality. This was briefly quite terrifying - it used to be us that begged the women to slap on the corset and the black bra, and now they were positively thrusting it in our faces and demanding that we live up to the promises that such underclothing apparently implied. But no one who favoured lingerie could truly object. Certainly I didn't.</p> <p>Of course, for a few years what Madonna was parading about in was still the stuff of sex shops and Soho. Then came Agent Provocateur - and provocation went mainstream. </p> <p>I remember not having the courage to go into the first branch of AP that I encountered - not the Soho one but the Notting Hill one - not because of the lingerie but the shop assistants. They were bloody beautiful, dressed in beautiful AP garments with extraordinary scantiness and looked like extras from Emmanuelle. They made me somewhat nervous, and I contented myself with walking slowly past the window, or occasionally pretending to stop and comb my hair (an act that, I am sure, fooled no one).</p> <p>I eventually took my girlfriend to visit, and was surprised to find what a non-threatening place it was. I had thought 'sex shop' but it was more like M&amp;S - the bordello girls were fresh and friendly without being tacky, and it was a great pleasure buying my partner a bustier, some stockings and a little black bra and panty set. It cost an absolute fortune, but for the first time I realised that women actually really liked this stuff. It made the wearer feel sexy, and that was what made the voyeur feel sexy in turn. </p> <p>Nowadays I will happily wander into Agent Provocateur to spend a few spare quid on bits and pieces for the wife and to take my mind off the more imminent prospect of economic recession. Though as age and flesh move on, the enthusiasm to tickle my fancies does not always live up to the bullish price ticket. Perhaps it's better - and cheaper - to stick to window-shopping, since nowadays the shame has dissipated in proportion to desire.</p> <p>Having said that, I do wonder what that little red corset with the matching stockings that Helena is wearing as she pours herself into her leather boots would look like on me. Shame is, now it looks like I'll never be able to afford to find out.</p> <h2>Counter espionage</h2> <p><strong>Eva Wiseman on her life as a shopgirl at Agent Provocateur</strong></p> <p>I was a terrible, terrible shop girl. I ripped my Vivienne Westwood hobble skirt on a daily basis, tripping up and down the very steep staircase to fetch marabou mules from the upstairs shelves. I took my stilettos off and wiggled my throbbing toes around often, sometimes in front of customers. I even (and I got disciplined quite severely for this) recommended that one not-as-rich-as-all-the-rest customer who was looking for machine-washable underwear go to Marks &amp; Spencer, just down the road. I repeat, terrible. In my interview for the job, I saw they'd scrawled 'good hair' on my CV. In 1998, happily, my messy beehive was grounds enough for employment. </p> <p>When the shop was quiet, we were encouraged to refold the lingerie. I don't know if you've ever tried folding a thong. Try. It's not possible. It springs back to thong-ness however hard you compress it. The bras though were a joy to work with, the cups slotting, as they did, back into each other like spooning pets. Customers were women buying for their wedding nights, or men buying for their lovers. One of my regular customers was undergoing a sex change, and I helped him/her find the perfect post-op pyjamas. Late June (I remember, because the shop was hot and stank of lilies) a couple started coming in at lunchtimes. She'd try on corsets, and I'd help her lace them, and he'd stand just outside the heavy drapes of the dressing room, filming from under his jacket. If I'd been a better AP girl I'd have asked him discreetly to leave, but I'd heard a rumour about my predecessor, fired for posing for a Leg Sex shoot in the basement, and I didn't want to be fired. In my hazy A-level state all rudenesses melted into one. I learnt a lot: I learnt the benefits of a quarter-cup bra; how to sell a split-crotch knicker to a 60-year-old; that standing in four-inch heels for nine hours a day will lead to bunions in later life. I learnt that a 30D is exactly the same as a 32C, but people much prefer to be sized as the former, and I learnt that however fragile and sparkly a \u00a3100 G-string might be, a pant is still a pant.</p> <p>The week after I left, the hobbling uniforms were abandoned for pink nursey dresses. To this day, the smell of lilies always reminds me of amateur porn.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.agentprovocateur.com\">agentprovocateur.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Last Monday I was standing near the summit of Mount Etna in Sicily, watching smoke and steam rising out of one of its many craters. By the time I got back into mobile phone coverage, it was clear that another volcano was erupting rather closer to home. </p> <p>After weeks of unending news coverage of the global financial meltdown, the BBC found itself confronting all the elements of a classic tabloid story: two high-profile and sometimes controversial celebrities, a much-loved comedy actor and a prank that should never, ever have happened, let alone have hit the airwaves. </p> <p>The BBC broadcasts tens of thousands of hours of radio and television every year. Much of it is live and all of it relies not just on our editorial guidelines and systems of approval and compliance, but on the good judgment of presenters, producers and editorial leaders. They make the decisions about what is and is not acceptable, and 99.9 per cent of time they get it right. Occasionally, they get it wrong. In this case, they - and therefore the BBC - got it spectacularly wrong.</p> <p>As soon as we knew about the problem, we recognised that fact and made an immediate and full apology to Andrew Sachs, his family and our licence-payers. We wanted to understand what had happened. We wanted to be proportionate and fair to all of the individuals involved. But we knew we had to act promptly and firmly, and I believe we did. As well as a full and unreserved apology, we launched an investigation and put an interim report in front of the BBC Trust. The trust has approved my proposed actions and set some testing requirements of its own, and we immediately set about the task of implementing them.</p> <p>Jonathan Ross has also made a comprehensive and unreserved personal apology to Andrew Sachs and his grand-daughter. I believe that he fully understands the seriousness of what has happened. I have made very clear to him the central importance of the clause in his contract about not bringing the BBC into disrepute. We agree that nothing like this must ever happen again and that tight discipline will be required for the future.</p> <p>In all of this though, it is important to disentangle what happened on The Russell Brand Show with the broader, important but essentially separate debate about the boundaries of taste and creativity in modern comedy and entertainment. </p> <p>You can certainly argue about the whys and wherefores of strong language and the discussion of sex in television and radio programmes on the BBC and on other channels. What made this episode so repugnant to the public was the disgraceful invasion of privacy which the calls to Andrew Sachs's answering machine constituted - something which would have been wholly unacceptable, even if none of it had been broadcast. The fact that it was broadcast, of course, greatly compounds the error and the offence.</p> <p>We should be careful to distinguish this set of issues from the more general debate about taste and decency in comedy. It may well be that some viewers would find the expletive-laden phone rants of Malcolm Tucker, in BBC2's The Thick of It, offensive. We know that millions of others thought they were not just funny, but editorially justified - indeed an important part of the whole creative conception. </p> <p>At the BBC we have always felt that it's important not only to reflect the changing course of public attitudes, but also as a broadcaster funded by a universal licence fee to cater to all audiences. What is acceptable today in mainstream comedy would have shocked many viewers 20 years ago. Attitudes and values don't stand still, but there are absolute boundaries we must never cross. Our job is to strike the right balance in delivering content that feels modern and relevant to a wide range of audiences, some of whom are 18 and others 80. </p> <p>Our role is to identify comedy talent, writers, producers and presenters, and provide an environment and, most important, an editorial framework in which they can deliver programmes for different segments of our audiences. Not a rule-book that ensures that all programmes are risk and creativity free, but a commitment to back real originality and talent in a context of responsibility and common sense. And a commitment to our different audiences to signpost the output and to schedule and position it in ways which help them to find programmes they will value and enjoy, and avoid those that they won't. The watershed is an important part of our contract with parents and will remain so.</p> <p>Comedy at the BBC should mean everything from BBC1's Last of the Summer Wine to Radio 4's The Now Show to BBC3's The Mighty Boosh. That is what serving every household in the country entails.</p> <p>The BBC is one of the world's great broadcasters. Goodness knows, it attracts at least its fair share of criticism, but also well-earned plaudits - for its creativity, the trustworthiness of its journalism, the sheer range and quality of its output.</p> <p>Every day licence-payers can enjoy BBC programmes of real ambition, passion and conviction; programmes that entertain, inspire and challenge and offer valuable insights into our lives and the world around us. That's why it has been so painful for so many of us in the BBC to discover what was done in our name and in the name of entertainment by The Russell Brand Show</p> <p>We will do everything in our power to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again, but we will not over-react. I do not believe the British public wants us to lose our creative nerve or to stop backing the thousands of brilliant programme-makers who touch almost every household in the land each week with content that enriches their lives. We have a difficult balance to strike at the BBC - between different audiences and different values, between creativity and control - but it is in that difficult and delicate balance that the BBC's special brand of public service broadcasting subsists. And we are determined not just to defend it, but to strengthen it.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Thompson is Director-General of the BBC</p>",
  "<p>Given the drama of our last two presidential elections, most of us Americans are much too cautious to prognosticate prematurely. Nevertheless, I can't stifle a fizzy little hiccup of joy at the prospect of something like our own Nelson Mandela moment. </p> <p>By this, I do not mean to say that the election of Barack Obama would launch us into some sort of 'post-race' utopia - it is na\u00efve to think that the urgently worrisome accumulations of racial inequality, ghetto isolation, horrendous rates of incarceration, or economic disparity will evaporate overnight. </p> <p>As one marker of progress, however, the election of Obama would be hugely significant. It would surely count as something like a toehold on the proverbial mountaintop for which Martin Luther King so longed. </p> <p>I am a baby boomer beneficiary of the Civil Rights movement. My life has been immeasurably enriched by the trajectory of events that began around the time I was born, and for which Obama's election would be a remarkable capstone. I was about three when Brown v. Board of Education ended legal segregation in schools; and, although I didn't understand its significance then, I remember the gathering of relatives at my aunt's house - there was an intense, sizzling electrical emotional arc that I have never forgotten.</p> <p>I was in pre-school when the Montgomery bus boycotts took place. Always a little ahead of their time, my mother and father wanted me to have a Rosa Parks doll; they wrote off to toy manufacturers urging them to mass-produce them. </p> <p>I was in second grade when Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas was integrated. It took an order by President Eisenhower and the summoning of federal troops for the nine new black students to beat a path through the angry mobs and survive, if barely. </p> <p>Years later, President Bill Clinton, who grew up a few towns away, would cite this as a particularly formative time in his life.</p> <p>I had just turned 12 when Martin Luther King delivered his searing 'I have a dream' speech at the March on Washington. I remember weeping in front of the television. Who could fail to be moved? Things were changing. </p> <p>Two weeks after that, four little girls died when white supremacists bombed their church in Alabama; and two months after that, President Kennedy was assassinated. </p> <p>It was a frighteningly dark time. Nevertheless, these events put political pressure on President Johnson, as well as on Congress, to sign and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which allowed outlawed discrimination based on race, colour, religion and national origin; and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, striking down literacy tests, poll taxes and other barriers designed to disfranchise black citizens. Johnson also issued Executive Order No. 11246, which required that 'affirmative action' be taken to hire more minorities in all realms of public employment.</p> <p>In 1967, the last formal legal barrier fell - the case of Loving v. Virginia overturned the anti-miscegenation laws that had made it illegal for blacks and whites to marry one another in 16 states.</p> <p>In the years since, various aspects of those foundational moments have been re-fought, in new settings, with differing facts and faces. As more blacks moved to the urban north, 'inner cities' became the battle ground. As we Civil Rights babies grew up, the fight to integrate schools expanded to become a broader movement for fair housing, equal pay, dignity and respect. </p> <p>Blacks were appointed to cabinet-level posts, military commands and the Supreme Court. There were sufficient numbers of African Americans elected to Congress that the Congressional Black Caucus was founded. </p> <p>Today, there are hundreds of black mayors in all parts of the United States, including the Deep South. And as the demographics of the United States have changed, so-called piggy-back coalitions have intersected with the core of the movement: other ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants, farm workers, women, gays, disabled and the elderly have all participated in pursuing the dream. </p> <p>And while there are moments when a Democratic partisan such as me wonders if it it's the kind of victory that turns winning into losing, there has even sufficient diversity to herald the first conservative Republican African Americans in high places, like Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.</p> <p>New waves of backlash persisted and persist still, of course; and if that backlash has become somewhat less vulgar, it is often more insidiously coded and complex.</p> <p>So while there is still much to be achieved, what is exciting about Obama's ascendancy is that it has been so unequivocally positive, so uplifting, so ... happy. When I think of the long slow progress of the modern Civil Rights movement, with its innumerable marches, murders, and martyrs, I can think of few victories that simultaneously had the potential for such genuine, uncompromised rejoicing as the vision of - dare I really say it? - President Barack Obama.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University, New York</p>",
  "<p>Trade unions want the right under UK law to expel British National Party activists - and deny them membership - as part of Labour plans to check the electoral advance of the far right.</p> <p>Labour backbenchers, supported by all the biggest unions, will unveil the plan on Tuesday when they put forward an amendment to the Employment Bill that would allow them to ban racists. The proposal - labelled 'Stalinist' by the BNP - comes amid concern that it could win as many as three seats in next year's European Parliament elections and make strong gains in council elections.</p> <p>Labour MPs, many of whom feel threatened by the BNP's advances in their constituencies, are concerned that the party is encouraging activists to infiltrate unions in order to spread subversive, racist messages in the workplace.</p> <p>Tony Lloyd, chairman of the trades union group of Labour MPs who has tabled the amendment, said it was vital that unions had the right to get rid of people working directly against their aims: 'What the unions are absolutely right to demand is the right to kick racists out of their organisations.'</p> <p>Until now unions have had to work under a legal framework set down under the Thatcher government in the early 1990s which prevented them from excluding people because of their membership of a particular political party. The Tory rules were seen at the time as a ploy to prevent unions from excluding or expelling those who broke strikes or were Conservative party members.</p> <p>But the government has to bring UK law into line with European law after Aslef, the train drivers' union, won a landmark case in the European Court of Human Rights which upheld its right to expel a driver who was a BNP activist.</p> <p>A spokesman for Thompsons solicitors, the trades union law firm, said: 'The amendment would mean a union could expel or deny membership to someone whose membership of a political party runs contrary to the union's rule book.'</p> <p>The BNP has 10,000 members across Britain and 46 councillors. Labour is worried that under the proportional representation system that will be used in European parliamentary elections next June it could secure seats in three of the 12 regions.</p> <p>Experts say that, under the list system, the BNP would need as little as 7.5 per cent of the vote in northwest England and only 11 per cent in Yorkshire and the West Midlands to install Euro-MPs in the Brussels and Strasbourg parliament. Labour also fears the BNP could become the largest party in two councils - Barking and Dagenham in Essex and Stoke-on-Trent - in next year's council elections if its anti-foreigner rhetoric struck a chord during the recession.</p> <p>MPs, anti-BNP campaigners and lawyers say the bill as recently amended in the Lords would leave the law in limbo and not guarantee the right of a union to eject BNP members. Nick Lowles, director of the anti-fascist group Searchlight, said: 'The current wording of the Employment Bill leaves us in the worst of all worlds. Aslef would still not be able to expel Jay Lee [the BNP member at the centre of the original European Court ruling] and unions would be left open to further legal action from the BNP.'</p> <p>Lowles said the amendment would give clarity, letting unions discipline and, where necessary, get rid of individual members for activities contrary to a union's rules and constitution. </p> <p>A Department for Business spokesman said: 'This is a very delicate issue that involves people's rights to freedom of association and their political beliefs. The government's approach will strike a balance between these rights. </p> <p>'Our present position is in line with the cross-party opinion in the Lords and Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights.'</p>",
  "<p>Who to listen to on a Saturday night, now that Russell Brand has been pulled off, so to speak? Well, there's Westwood on Radio 1 - always crazily upbeat - or, on 1Xtra, the equally hyper Target. But if you're up for a real frug on your rug, a proper party in your Punto, then you've got to tune into the pirates.</p> <p>I live in Brixton, south London, where the FM dial has long been a-bristle with excellent pirate stations. Arriving in London 20 years ago, I tuned into Kiss and Centreforce; later, Defection and Girls FM were my hands-aloft-ankles-akimbo chosen listening. Now, favourites include Point Blank (quality house music, not too much chat), Rinse FM<strong> </strong>(dubstep/grime/broken beats, cool as you like), Lightning FM (black music from soul to bashment, with bonus gospel messages) and DejaVu (bassline/broken/the new urban funky house). Though I'm actually quite happy just flicking through the dial to see what pops up: at the weekend you can choose from well over 60 thoroughly unofficial broadcasters, all spitting out music, shout-outs and chat with infectious energy and mega musical knowledge. You hear tracks on pirate stations months before they hit the national stations. And how could you resist those adverts? 'Sponsored by Hercules, the drink that gives you the power! (No caps or sportswear; this is a ticket-only event).'</p> <p>London, obviously, has the most pirates, but every major city in Britain fizzes with unofficial broadcasters, such as Buzz FM in Manchester. How a pirate station works is this: the DJ's set is beamed out from the studio to local listeners via a transmitting aerial (usually in a high spot), using microwaves and/or radio waves. Though the popular image of a pirate DJ is of a teenager in his bedroom, spinning tracks and spitting rhymes, the better pirates are no amateur affair. For a start, they never position their transmitter in the same place as their studio, so that if Ofcom locates and removes either, it's only seized half of the equipment needed for broadcast. Transmitters are more easily tracked down, so many pirates use at least two: then if one gets destroyed, another can take up the slack.</p> <p>Because, lest we forget, pirates are illegal. Unlicensed broadcasting is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years; and if you're convicted, you're barred from working on a legal station for five years. So people have become very canny about where they locate their transmitters. Mr X, who runs a long-established pirate station, explained the latest trickery to me. You know the shaft in the centre of a tower block, that runs from the roof to the ground, for access to air-conditioning, gas pipes etc? You go to the roof, attach a wire to your transmitter and drop it 30 feet down into the shaft. There's a metal plate also attached, above the transmitter. Once positioned, the plate flips snugly into place so that when an Ofcom inspector looks down the shaft all that can be seen is the metal plate, not the transmitter beneath. </p> <p>Mr X also outlined the rules of successful (meaning long-lasting) pirate broadcasting. They're surprisingly conservative. First: don't swear. If your DJs curse, or if they bring up potentially explosive issues like race or religion, Ofcom will be on your case faster than you can say 'I hate effing purple Scientologists'. Second: don't let your signal bleed into other stations' wavelengths. The authorities often trot out the old clich\u00e9 about pirates, that they interfere with police radio frequencies or air traffic control. Actually, the cleverer ones don't; neither do they slip into legal stations' wavelengths. It's the under-experienced, over-enthusiastic broadcaster that does that, and they're quickly silenced. Third: broadcast within recommended sound limitations.</p> <p>The better pirates pride themselves on being as professional as the legals, with top-notch equipment and production: indeed, several DJs from national stations play out on them, using assumed names. Still, even the established stations run the risk of being raided and closed down (for instance, when I tuned into Point Blank last week, it wasn't on). I spoke to Ofcom's Peter Davies and he assured me that 'we absolutely don't tacitly allow some pirates stations to broadcast and not others. Pirate broadcasting remains illegal'. Still, he acknowledged that the most recent Ofcom research (2007) shows that 25 per cent of the entire London radio audience tunes into pirates (40 per cent of the black audience) and that 'they clearly offer something that listeners can't get elsewhere'. </p> <p>So why doesn't Ofcom allow some of the more popular stations to become legal? Kiss and Choice FM both started off as pirates and are now two of London's most listened-to broadcasters. Some stations, such as Rinse FM, are reputed to be working towards legal status. I spoke to one of their DJs, however, and he wasn't sure whether legality would be a good thing. He likes the immediacy of pirate broadcasting. 'On Rinse I can play what I like,' he said. 'And you get feedback straight away, via MSN or text. If I play a track that people like, I can pull it back (play it again) right away.' </p> <p>Pirates are unlikely to go away because they give listeners - and those who work on them - something that legal stations never can. Everyone involved in a pirate feels like they're close to and representing a scene. So much so that DJs pay to play (around \u00a310 an hour) and those who run the stations often have regular jobs as well. It's a labour of love rather than a job. And for the listener, as well as the tunes you get an energy and excitement that well-paid, fat-bottomed professional presenters can never give you.</p> <p>One final point: the Ofcom report revealed that 'those who listen to illegal broadcasts express little or no desire to acquire a DAB receiver'. Which, for me, means that DAB is unlikely ever to take off. If you subscribe to the idea that people who use technology (rather than those who make it) are the ones who predict the future, then DAB is dead before it's even arrived. </p> <p>DAB has two big problems. The first is the sound: not as good as FM. The second is that car radios are still not digital. Perhaps new cars will come with digital radios... but it's already too late. The future of radio is the internet: the pirates have moved online in a big way. All the biggest stations have live web feeds. Combine this with mobile phone internet access and you can use your phone to tune into a London pirate when you're in, say, Glasgow. Then simply plug your mobile into your car radio, and away you go. Pirate stations instantly move from being local to national and even worldwide. And DAB seems even less relevant...</p> <h2>Illegal eagles</h2> <p><strong>Pointblank</strong> 90.2/ <a href=\"http://www.pointblank.fm\">pointblank.fm</a> <br>Long-running house and dance station, established 1994.</p> <p><strong>Rinse FM </strong>100.4/ <a href=\"http://www.rinsefm.blogspot.com\">rinsefm.blogspot.com</a><br>Dubstep and grime, based in east London.</p> <p><strong>Deja Vu FM</strong> 92.3/ <a href=\"http://www.dejavufm.com\">dejavufm.com</a><br>R&amp;B, garage and house.</p> <p><strong>Lightning FM </strong>90.8/ <a href=\"http://www.lightningfm.co.uk\">lightningfm.co.uk</a><br>Community-minded; soul, gospel, urban, R&amp;B.</p>",
  "<p>The trunk show for Tinc - the tiny San Francisco-based fashion label - is New York Fashion Week's most achingly hip, most secretive event. It is held on a sticky day in early September, on the sixth floor of an anonymous warehouse building located 20 blocks down from the big tents and the main action of Bryant Park. Its designer, Savannah Knoop, greets a handful of fashion-week hipsters - the edgiest stylists, the most fashion-forward fashion editors - oh, and me. She rolls out her clothes on two chrome rails, so that we can cop a feel. She encourages us to try her creations on in the loos located halfway down a darkened corridor; she feeds us with farmers'-market brownies and a wine-punch concoction. There is no runway show, no models, no music, no scary clipboard ladies, and no reverence.</p> <p>Tinc is brilliant. Androgynous, sharp, well-structured, well-fitting, cooler than Christmas. I don't care that 'Tinc' means 'throwaway' in Thai; that it's as green, as a company, as it possibly can be; that the pieces are spiritual one-offs, individually numbered and fashioned from unusual fabrics. I don't care that the logo is a visual representation of the soundwaves created whenever anyone says 'I love you'. I just care that it's good. </p> <p>No doubt about it, Savannah Knoop is an excellent designer. But the other thing she is, is an excellent liar. Accomplished, adventurous, and daring. I know this because, for six years, Knoop lived a lie. For six years, Knoop perpetuated one of the biggest literary hoaxes of modern times. </p> <p>The Noughties have been an outstanding time for literary hoaxes. In 2006, James Frey was exposed as inventing parts of A Million Little Pieces, his memoir of a lifetime of drug addiction. This year, it transpired that Love and Consequences, Margaret B Jones's memoir of growing up as a mixed race, drug-running foster child in South Central Los Angeles, was the fabricated work of private-school-educated, all-white Margaret Seltzer. Stephen Glass turned his multiple journalistic hoaxes into a professional identity; his story became the subject of a 2004 film, his 2003 autobiographical account of the hoaxing having done very nicely indeed, thank you. </p> <p>But the best - the most extravagant, most starry, most decadent - literary hoax de nos jours, was committed in the name of JT LeRoy. </p> <p>Jeremiah 'Terminator' LeRoy was the Aids-afflicted, emotionally damaged son of a truck-stop prostitute, who'd spent his teenage years living rough on the streets of San Francisco and turning tricks, who'd had a male-to-female sex change; and who overcame all this, and more, to became a literary wunderkind. In 1999, his first novel - Sarah, the story of a child prostitute, which was presumed to be semi-autobiographical - was published, to critical acclaim; within a year, LeRoy was the darling of a hip, indie celeb crowd. He was friends with Winona Ryder (who claimed she met him before he was published, while he was still living rough, hanging about outside the opera house, 'a real ragamuffin'), with photographer Juergen Teller, with Courtney Love. Madonna sent him Kabbalah readings; he was a confidant of Liv Tyler ('who told him everything'). He made the cover of Vanity Fair - in 2003, the magazine ran a gushing story on him, in which they praised his writing abilities extravagantly ('To literary critics and his fellow writers, JT LeRoy has distinguished himself as a precocious talent able to mine golden prose from his white-trash childhood ...'); drew comparisons with immense cultural icons ('In public, LeRoy maintains a Warhol-like mystique. He wears wigs, female apparel, and oversize sunglasses, and he seldom says a word. And yet he can give better phone than Warren Beatty, drawing powerful women into his world with his raspy, girlish drawl') and wondered whether or not his ever-expanding coteries of adoring female celebrity fans will 'make his career, or break it?' (In March 2005, he also made the cover of the Observer Magazine, which ran a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/fiction\">reverent and sincere interview</a> with him.) He was a house-guest of Carrie Fisher. Shirley Manson wrote a song about him; the actor Michael Pitt played an approximation of him in Gus Van Sant's adaptation of his collection of short stories, The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things. Designers clamoured to dress him, magazine editors clamoured to commission him. Asia Argento - the Italian film actress and director - had a relationship with him. For six years, JT LeRoy was the hottest, hippest, brightest, most intriguing literary sensation in the world. </p> <p>Which was great, except - he didn't exist. His books were written by Laura Albert, a fortysomething woman who had been a punk, a phone-sex worker, and a porn author, but had never lived on the streets of San Francisco or worked as a teenage prostitute. Savannah Knoop - Albert's twentysomething sister-in-law - had played JT publicly. Knoop bound her breasts, and wore a preposterous blonde wig and sunglasses, affected a West-Virginian accent; and appeared as JT whenever a physical boy was needed. Knoop gave JT's press conferences, she partied on his behalf, she travelled the world as him, doing readings and signings. She posed as him on photoshoots. She had dinners with the directors and actors who optioned LeRoy novels as films; she hung around on set and advised when these films were being made. She had friendships as JT. She had the love affair with Asia Argento.</p> <p>Everywhere she went, Knoop was accompanied by Albert, who posed as Speedie, JT's 'handler'. This allowed Albert to feed Knoop lines when necessary, and cover for any gaps in 'his' knowledge, any biographical discrepancies. </p> <p>For six years, it worked. People bought into JT, to a greater or lesser degree. They didn't ask too many questions. One journalist who spent time with JT LeRoy and Speedie when they came to London on a promotional tour says simply: 'We knew something was up, just not what, exactly. And it was fun; they were fun.' </p> <p>Then, inevitably, Albert and Knoop were found out. In October 2005, Stephen Beachy, a reporter from New York magazine, published his suspicions that JT LeRoy was the pen name of Laura Albert; shortly after that, Warren St John, a writer on the New York Times, published his suspicions that Knoop played JT's physical alter ego. The whole story emerged pretty quickly after that; Geoffrey Knoop (Knoop's half-brother; Albert's then husband), revealed everything he knew, in an article in the New York Times in February 2006.</p> <p>Two years of fallout ensued. Albert's was visible and intense - she was successfully sued for fraud by the film company who optioned Sarah; she split from Geoffrey Knoop. </p> <p>Savannah Knoop, meanwhile, slipped from public view - effortlessly, because no one really knew what she looked like. She was not legally accountable for the hoax; consensus among those celebrities (and non-celebrities) who had been hoaxed, was that they were less wronged by Knoop than by Albert, who, it was felt, had pulled the strings. </p> <p>But now, Knoop is revisiting the affair. She's written a book, Girl Boy Girl, an account of her six years as JT LeRoy; it's published in the UK next week. Laura Albert is extremely cross about the whole thing. When she heard that Knoop was planning a book, she said: 'I am not in any way connected with this book and it disgusts me. Just because you play a writer doesn't mean you are a writer. I think Savannah is being motivated by money and attention. Now that she's had to go back to being a civilian, this is her way of getting back to it. It's sad and it's sleazy. She's really stepping on my feelings ... I'm not interested in making a career of JT, I'm an artist.'</p> <p>But Knoop's unapologetic about her endeavour, and happy to tell to me all about it.</p> <p>So I meet Knoop at the Tinc trunk show. Knoop's always made clothes on the side - she is that kind of a girl. Since the demise of JT LeRoy, she's developed this dabbling into a serious fashion concern. </p> <p>No one else at the trunk show has ever heard of JT LeRoy. The editors and stylists are completely clueless about Savannah Knoop's brilliant and preposterous back story. Then I meet Mary Ellen Mark, the photographer who shot Knoop as JT LeRoy for Vanity Fair in 2003, and who was the only person to address the issue of JT's gender identity directly at that time. 'I've hung out with many transgendered people over the years,' Mark told JT, after their shoot, 'but I don't feel the residue of a boy with you. JT, you don't feel like a boy to me.'</p> <p>At the Tinc show, Mark embraces Knoop, who introduces her to me. </p> <p>You're the one who knew, I say. </p> <p>'Of course I knew!' Mark tells me. She gestures up and down at Knoop, who is standing feet away from her. 'Look at her! She looks like a girl!'</p> <p>And she does. </p> <p>Knoop and I meet again, the following morning over brunch.</p> <p>'Gosh, this all feels very ... intimate,' she says. </p> <p>Because I know lots about you from reading the book, I say. </p> <p>'Right,' she says. 'And it's not that I ... wouldn't tell you those things after a while; but I wouldn't tell you off the bat.'</p> <p>We start with biographical facts, of which there are many more knocking around for JT LeRoy than for Savannah Knoop. Knoop tells me that she was born in 1981 ('the same year as JT, I think ...') which makes her 27, although she seems older. Her family is extravagantly extended. Her father, John Knoop, is a big deal on the San Francisco film-making scene; her mother, Sharon Hennessey, is an acupuncturist and teacher, writer and film producer. John already had three children when he met Sharon; together, they had a daughter, Hennessey (whose surname is Knoop, you'll be relieved to hear); 10 years later, they had Savannah. Knoop's parents split up when Knoop was five, John Knoop moved out, but maintained a decent relationship with his daughters. Knoop and Hennessey grew up to have close relationships with their half-brothers and sisters. </p> <p>She was, she says, 'a little weird, as a kid. I mean, I got on with other kids, but ...' (Knoop trails off a lot, leaves sentences unfinished, perhaps because she hasn't yet got her thoughts in order; perhaps, because this, too, is an evasive tactic she picked up while playing JT.) She went to an all-girls boarding school, which she really loved ('There was minimal cattiness compared with co-ed'); and she meant to go to college, but somehow didn't. 'I was floating, out of high school. Trying to work out what I wanted to be doing.' Her half-brother Geoff began a relationship with Laura Albert; they had a band called Thistle, they needed a singer, and they recruited Knoop. 'I didn't even want to be a singer. Can I sing? Kind of. Really, I think they were just looking for somebody who was ... younger.'</p> <p>Simultaneously Albert, who had written a smattering of short stories as JT LeRoy, was beginning to gain profile, and had realised that she'd need a physical JT. She began by approaching fey young men on the streets of San Francisco, and attempting to explain to them what it was she was looking for. She graduated on to butch young women. But she couldn't find anyone quite right. 'I was wishing, hoping, that Laura would ask me to do it,' Knoop says. 'In my mind, I thought: OK, you need these two slots to be filled - JT, and a singer for the band - and I'd rather be in that slot, the JT slot.'</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>'I was intrigued by the idea of being someone else. I was obsessed by the whole idea of androgyny.'</p> <p>Because you're bisexual?</p> <p>She laughs. 'Queer. But, yeah...'</p> <p>You've had relationships with women as well as men?</p> <p>'Yes.'</p> <p>Did that help you become a boy?</p> <p>'Probably. It's about inhabiting both.'</p> <p>After trying unsuccessfully to recruit a stranger to play JT LeRoy, Albert saw a photo-booth snap of Knoop, and realised that she would make a good JT. Days later, Knoop bound her breasts for the first time, put on the blond wig and sunglasses as extra disguise, and posed for pictures that would accompany a small magazine interview Albert had already given over the telephone. She was petrified, but the shoot went well. Chris, the photographer ('I've forgotten his surname, and the name of the magazine'), accepted Knoop as JT. The story ran. </p> <p>They had, Knoop says, absolutely no idea what they were getting themselves into.</p> <p>'I think we were both, like: let's try this out. But no. I don't think we had any idea what was going to happen.' </p> <p>Was Knoop perpetually scared she'd be found out?</p> <p>'Yes! Terrified! Though she [Laura Albert] wasn't! She wasn't! I was constantly, so scared all the time. Every time we would do anything. But she always thought we'd be fine. It never crossed her mind.'</p> <p>What did you think would happen if you were discovered?</p> <p>'I don't know. I just knew it would be bad.'</p> <p>It's hard to know exactly how things evolved from that point. Knoop's memory of the next six years is fractured and muddled; even after reading Girl Boy Girl, I'm not a lot clearer on what happened when. It's an excellent yarn, and it's well written (contrary to expectations, Knoop is a natural writer), but it is circuitous, and Knoop is not a rigorous researcher. When she forgets things - names, details, places - she makes something up, and asterixes the relevant section. Which is charming, but not exactly informative.</p> <p>What we do know is that, in the space of 18 months, JT LeRoy garnered a trendy and adoring public, a cult celebrity following and a luxurious lifestyle - although that wasn't a constant for Knoop. When she wasn't playing LeRoy, she went back to San Francisco where she waitressed in a Thai restaurant, and no one had any idea about her dual life. </p> <p>You had to work?</p> <p>'Yes!'</p> <p>Playing JT didn't make you rich?</p> <p>She laughs. 'Nooooo!'</p> <p>Did the constant adjustments between the two lifestyles become confusing?</p> <p>'It screwed with my head! There was nothing special about the way I was going through my early twenties - apart from JT. What I loved so much was harbouring that secret; and going back and being able to say to myself: these guys don't know what's going on! I'm here! And I'm there, too!'</p> <p>JT LeRoy's relationship with Asia Argento is perhaps the most intriguing element of Knoop's experiences. She says that she's lost contact with everyone she met as JT, apart from one man, who was so unsettled by the truth that he doubted everything for a while. 'There was this thing where he was looking at everything and going: is this real? Is this spoon real? It shook, you know, everything. The truth that he thought he ... had.' But he did not sleep with JT LeRoy. Asia Argento did. </p> <p>Asia Argento met JT LeRoy on a book tour in Italy for Harold's End, LeRoy's last novel. Argento had been emailing Albert, as LeRoy, for a few months before that, but she transferred all her attentions to Knoop. They began a relationship.</p> <p>Argento must have known something was up.</p> <p>'She says she didn't! I don't think she can admit that she knew something was up. I think she probably did.'</p> <p>Because you were close - on every level. </p> <p>'Right.'</p> <p>Physically close...</p> <p>Knoop laughs. 'Right! Everyone goes, she was so naive to think anyone could have had a perfect sex change. But I don't know ...'</p> <p>I ask her if she felt guilty about cheating Argento into a relationship with her; Knoop doesn't really answer. 'It was unsettling, to be with her, and not be ... although I spent enough time with her at the end, so that basically I felt like we connected on so many other things. And it was this whole thing. At some point, I told Asia that she should call me Savannah. I don't know why.'</p> <p>Perhaps so that you could merge JT's identity with your own? So you could feel like you were telling her the truth, without actually telling her the truth?</p> <p>'Exactly. Right. It was all so close to the truth by that point. Anyway, she didn't call me Savannah. She always called me JT.'</p> <p>Did you fall in love with her?</p> <p>'I don't know.' She seems exasperated. 'I question that. It wasn't quite falling in love. I wanted her ... to tell me I was OK.'</p> <p>Perhaps Knoop doesn't feel guilty about Argento because Argento hurt Knoop. When Argento, Knoop and Michael Pitt were working together on the film adaptation of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, Argento invited Knoop, as JT, and Michael Pitt, back to her hotel suite - and chose to spend the night with Pitt. Knoop was devastated; the whole episode is documented in Girl Boy Girl</p> <p>Do you think she's angry with you?</p> <p>'I think she's angry.'</p> <p>Are you sorry for that?</p> <p>'I feel like I want to talk to her about it.'</p> <p>Are you still angry with her over Pitt?</p> <p>'To a degree.' Pause. 'I read an interview about how she felt ... and the only thing she said was, she honestly thought I was a boy, because I had such hairy legs. She'd never seen such hair on a girl's legs! And I think: that's all? I think that if she read the book, she would understand why I did it. But I think we should ... talk about it. Hash it out.'</p> <p>I like Knoop very much. She is charismatic and engaging, and I find it exciting that people still do these kinds of things - have these exciting, preposterous adventures. I think she wanted to write her story for all the reasons she gives me - to get it down, to get it straight, to 'stop it falling through the cracks'. But also I suspect that Laura Albert's right when she suggests that Knoop misses the limelight, and this is her attempt to reclaim it. Knoop says she doesn't want to be famous: 'No! Not at all!' But she freely admits to feeling incredibly lost once the hoax was exposed. She admits that she misses the experience of JT LeRoy desperately, and that she misses having secrets 'to the point that I started trying to get other secrets, new secrets'. She laughs about that. She tells me that she loved being JT, that it was addictive, and fun 'and exciting and glamorous! He was really glamorous!'</p> <p>Would she have ever stopped being him, if she hadn't been found out?</p> <p>'No. I don't think so. No.'</p> <p>So maybe Savannah Knoop does want another go at celebrity, maybe she hasn't even quite admitted that to herself. She will say that she wants Tinc to grow, 'but not too big, I want to keep it close'; and that she wants Albert to make some peace with Girl Boy Girl. 'I think she just needs to start writing again.'</p> <p>So, I say, you want Laura Albert to get over it, and Asia Argento to get in touch?</p> <p>She grimaces.</p> <p>'I don't want that to be, like, my calling card! No! Like: call me, Asia! No! If our paths are meant to cross, then they will.'</p> <p>Do you believe in all that?</p> <p>'Probably not,' Savannah Knoop says. 'But sometimes - it happens anyway.'</p> <h2>Girl Boy Girl: Savannah faces the Italian press as JT LeRoy</h2> <p>At a JT LeRoy press conference for 'his' last book, Harold's End, in Rome, Savannah Knoop, disguised as JT, is accompanied by her sister-in-law and 'manager' Laura Albert and Loretta from the Italian publishers. It was here that she met, for the first time, Italian actress Asia Argento, with whom she then had an affair.</p> <p>Loretta dragged me to the podium. I could hear everyone getting into their seats. There were red glowing blindspots burned into my retinas. I could barely see Asia and Laura settled into two seats in the front row. Loretta tapped at the microphone and started to introduce me in Italian. I was shaking, and every so often I would jerk my head, like I was trying to pull a crick out of my neck. </p> <p>She said something and everyone laughed wryly. I could tell she was wrapping it up now. 'I present JT.' </p> <p>They clapped. Laura gestured to me to say something. I mustered a low 'Hi'. Someone coughed. What were they waiting for? Were they second-guessing me? People raised their hands. Loretta pointed at them. She seemed to know all of them. </p> <p>'Yes, Antonia.' Antonia shot off a question. Loretta nodded her head. She said, 'Ah, they want to know, what are the wig and glasses for?'</p> <p>I was relieved that we had started with something easy. 'Um,' I breathed heavily into the microphone, 'I put so much into the books. I wear the wig so that people won't recognise me, so that I can keep something for me that's personal. Same thing with my eyes.'</p> <p>I pushed a last breath into the microphone. The sunspots were receding. In practically all the interviews, this question came up in one form or another. The most direct had been in another city, when an interviewer said, 'You could be anybody. How do we know you are who you say you are? I mean, you sound like a woman to me.' The rest of the reporters muttered and shook their head at him, indignant that he had asked such a question. I would be saved each time by remembering Laura's rule: always go in further to get out. </p> <p>'Um, you don't know. And you won't know. And I don't want you to know. JT could be back in Spokane, a 500-pound black man, like that guy, the voice of Elmo, right? Some people say I am Dennis Cooper. Some people say I am really Gus Van Sant. I like that. I mean, yer absolutely right. I could be anybody. As fer sounding like a woman, thank you.' I curtsied. </p> <p>'You wrote on your website that writing is your lifesaver. Is it still true? Is it your raison d'\u00eatre?' My raison d'\u00eatre, I thought bitterly, is to put on a wig and speak in a lousy Southern accent.</p> <p>'Uh, yeah. I think it is the same today ...'</p> <p>'In your novel, Sarah says, \"We all need someone to know who we really are\". Today, do you know who you are?' </p> <p>'Um, no. No, I don't think I do.' </p> <p>After it was over, the reporters took a flurry of pictures, and I realised that the sunspots were actually from flashbulbs. Loretta led me off the podium. I stubbed my sneakers on the bricks and stumbled off.</p> <p>\u2022 Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy is published by Seven Stories Press.

  "<p>Savers hoping to secure a decent fixed rate should hurry, as banks and building societies are expected to cut the rates on their top-paying accounts in line with last month's drop in the Bank of England base rate.</p> <p>Banks and building societies usually incorporate each monthly base-rate change into their products by the end of the same month, meaning most providers will be dropping their rates within the next week - by which time there may well have been another cut in the base rate. The Bank of England reduced the rate from 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent last month, and most experts expect it to fall by the same amount again this week.</p> <p>'You should take advantage of good fixed rates while you can,' says Andrew Hagger of price comparison site <a href=\"http://www.moneynet.co.uk/\">Moneynet.co.uk</a>. 'If the base rate does come down again this week, the knock-on effect is that savings rates will drop even further by the end of November and early December. So if you've got some money that you don't need to access, it's worth picking one of the high-paying fixed-rate accounts that are still around. There are still some good deals.'</p> <p>For savers willing to put money into foreign banks, rates of 7 per cent or more are achievable. Indian bank ICICI dropped the rate on its 12-month HiSave bond from 7.2 per cent to 7.1 per cent at the end of last week, while the Anglo Irish one-year bond is paying 7.05 per cent interest on a minimum deposit of \u00a3500 and its nine-month bond pays 7 per cent, also from \u00a3500. </p> <p>If you feel more comfortable saving with a UK institution, the Coventry building society has just launched its one-year Poppy Bond, paying 6.25 per cent from \u00a3500 - and when you open the bond, the Coventry will make a donation to the Poppy Appeal on your behalf. </p> <p>Birmingham Midshires is paying 6.85 per cent on its six-month bond, on a minimum deposit of \u00a31, while over-fifties could take advantage of Saga's fixed-rate six-month bond, which pays 6.9 per cent on \u00a31 or more. </p> <p>Michelle Slade, from price comparison website <a href=\"http://moneyfacts.co.uk/\">Moneyfacts.co.uk</a>, says: 'Some people may feel that they don't want to be tied in to long-term bonds because they don't know what the financial market will be like six months on. These shorter-term deals still let you get a good rate and get access to your money sooner.'</p> <p>Leeds building society is, however, offering savers the opportunity to lock away their money in a bond, but retain access to 25 per cent of the balance without any notice or penalties. The account pays 5.25 per cent interest on balances under \u00a349,999. Slade says: 'This isn't a market-leading rate but it's not bad if you consider that you've got the possibility to access some of it, which is a good function in case you need to dip in for any unexpected emergencies.'</p> <p>But if access to your money is a real priority, then you should consider a simple easy-access savings account rather than a bond in the first place. Slade recommends Stroud and Swindon building society's easy-access postal account, paying 5.9 per cent on a minimum opening deposit of \u00a31,000, and West Bromwich building society's Stratus no-notice account, paying 6.56 per cent from \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Hagger says: 'Everyone needs a rainy-day fund that you can get into if the washing machine breaks down or you need to get the car fixed. You should look at internet accounts that let you transfer money into your current account relatively quickly if you need the money in an emergency.'</p> <p>For internet accounts, he recommends Intelligent Finance's i-saver, paying 6.4 per cent from an opening balance of \u00a31, or Birmingham Midshires' e-saver, which is offering 6.33 per cent on balances of more than \u00a31.</p> <p>But if you're trying to build up your savings from scratch, Hagger says you should start by filling up your Isa. 'Make the most of your tax-free benefits first, and then look to other easy-access savings accounts,' says Hagger. 'You have to start somewhere with savings, and even though \u00a325 a month doesn't sound like very much, by the end of the year you will have saved \u00a3300. The best thing to do is set up a direct debit so that your money goes straight into your Isa on the day that you get paid, so that you're not tempted to spend it.'</p> <p>Alliance &amp; Leicester's 'easy Isa', Birmingham Midshire's 'direct Isa' and the Principality building society's 'e-Isa' are all paying 6 per cent interest on minimum opening balances of \u00a31.</p> <h2>Are your savings safe?</h2> <p>The Financial Services Compensation Scheme [FSCS] will cover you for up to \u00a350,000 of savings held with any bank or building society that has its own banking licence.</p> <p>If you have savings over \u00a350,000 with the same provider, or with banks that share a banking licence, you should consider spreading your money around to keep your balance below the \u00a350,000 mark.</p> <p>To check which providers are considered part of the same bank for compensation purposes, visit our savings checker online at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2008/sep/25/savings.providers\">theguardian.com/money</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Win \u00a31,000 to save or invest.

  "<p>Abbey was last week presenting itself as a promoter of prudence to first-time borrowers, while coming under attack for risky lending practices.</p> <p>The lender announced that it wanted to encourage traditional saving and borrowing habits through a new high-interest savings account targeted at first-time buyers. The First Home Saver account, which pays 8 per cent AER, is available only to aspiring home owners aged 16 to 35 who want to build up a deposit.</p> <p>But at the same time the bank is coming under fire from potential borrowers and politicians for continuing to offer loans equivalent to five times a borrower's income to those with good financial records.</p> <p>Customers who open a First Home Saver account (through branches) must deposit from \u00a3100 to \u00a3300 a month by standing order, starting with an opening balance of between \u00a3100 to \u00a35,000, and can save up to a maximum of \u00a350,000. Savers who miss a payment or fail to deposit the minimum \u00a3100 will have their interest cut to 0.1 per cent for that month. No partial withdrawals are allowed and, on closing the account completely, the saver must have an interview with an Abbey mortgage adviser, although the saver doesn't have to take out an Abbey mortgage. </p> <p>The deal smacks of the conditions laid down by building societies in the Seventies, when borrowers had to save for long periods before being 'granted an audience' with the branch manager to ask for a mortgage. </p> <p>Mortgage brokers are unenthusiastic about the scheme. Richard Morea of London &amp; Country says: 'The interest rate is attractive, and [the maximum] \u00a350,000 [would be] a healthy deposit for a first-time buyer, but the other details are restrictive.' </p> <p>Abbey says it is not charging penalties for savers who don't choose an Abbey product as it is 'confident it will have the best mortgage available for first-time buyers at the time of withdrawal'. But Morea says: 'Abbey's best deals are only available for those with a 40 per cent deposit. If you had the \u00a350,000 maximum saved up, this would only allow you to buy a home costing \u00a3125,000 - quite limiting in most areas, even with prices falling.'</p> <p>Any attempt to encourage borrowers to save more before buying a home will be welcome to the government, which announced a 70 per cent rise in repossessions last week. However, Abbey is one of the few lenders still prepared to lend five times a borrower's income. Last week, Vince Cable, Liberal Democrat shadow Chancellor, said the next group of borrowers to face financial difficulties were likely to be those who have borrowed high amounts compared to their income: figures released by the Bank of England indicated that more than a third of UK borrowers are in this position.</p> <p>Abbey protests that it bases its calculations on affordability, including the borrower's debts, outgoings, children and whether they have a non-working spouse. It says this is more realistic and can often result in a smaller loan being given than if the borrowing had been based purely on income. Only those with clean credit records, no dependants or little debt would be allowed big loans.</p> <p>But Cable describes Abbey's willingness to lend at these levels as 'quite bewildering and completely mad'. 'In the US, one of the definitions of sub-prime lending is where someone is borrowing more than three-and-a-half times their income,' he says.</p> <p>An Observer reader, who prefers to remain anonymous, was provisionally offered an Abbey loan of more than \u00a3500,000, based on a joint income of \u00a3100,000. Her mortgage adviser warned that the loan was dependent on a credit check, and that because she and her partner were only putting down a 10 per cent deposit, the interest rate would be 'really high'. She refused the loan: 'If we had paid what they wanted every month, all we would have been left with was subsistence money.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.insley@observer.co.uk\">j.insley@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Nobody likes to be told they are losing their looks as they age. Channel 4 was stung to read in The Observer that it was 'losing its appeal' ... as it 'stumbled into adulthood'. </p> <p>All mainstream UK media is experiencing declining audiences due to an explosion of digital media choices. Channel 4 has inevitably lost viewers in the migration from a four-channel TV universe to one of 400. We should be judged on how we've performed relative to our competitors and how our business is evolving to meet the challenge of a fully digital media marketplace. </p> <p>The core Channel 4 service has retained its appeal better than all its terrestrial rivals. Since 2003, for example, ITV1's viewing has declined by 21 per cent and BBC 2 is down 30 per cent. Channel 4 has lost just 12 per cent. The same pattern is true among younger audiences, with Channel 4's viewing among 16- to 34-year-olds declining half as fast as ITV1. This has not been achieved by diluting our editorial - Channel 4 again won more Bafta and Royal Television Society awards this year than any other channel. </p> <p>In response to massive structural shifts in global media, we have diversified through the launch of Film4, E4, More4, Channel 4+1, 4 Music and 4oD. Collectively, our channels enjoy a record 12 per cent of the total TV audience and are watched by nearly a fifth of all 16- to 34-year-olds. A decade ago, when Sky Digital heralded the digital revolution, Channel 4 had 10 per cent of viewing. We're one of an elite band of media companies which has experienced growth in recent years - ITV and the BBC have declined, despite adding new services. This success has helped to secure our highest-ever annual share of total TV advertising, in excess of 24 per cent.</p> <p>The financial performance of our digital channels has been transformed after years of loss-making. This year each digital service will make a profit; collectively they will contribute tens of millions of pounds to our bottom line. </p> <p>The desire to continue improving the financial contribution from our digital portfolio guided our planned investment in radio. We're not embarrassed that the rapid recent downturn has forced us to abandon this investment. Rather, we're frustrated that a valuable future profit stream has been denied to us. </p> <p>Were Channel 4 privately owned, this successful diversification would give us cause for optimism about the transition to digital. But, as a publicly owned broadcaster that does not receive a cash subsidy, Channel 4 faces the additional challenge of trying to maintain its investment in public service content. It is the cost of meeting our public service contribution that is the root of our much discussed funding gap, forecast to exceed \u00a3150m by 2012. </p> <p>There is an easy way to close this gap - stop producing the range of high-quality but economically unviable content that we outlined in our Next on 4 creative blueprint: Channel 4 News; an hour-long Dispatches and Cutting Edge most weeks; documentaries about history, science, religion; original British comedies; single dramas such as The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall; British films such as this week's London Film Festival finale Slumdog Millionaire; major arts projects such as Steve McQueen's Hunger. This and much more will be lost if Channel 4 withers for want of proper public support. The 22,000 jobs we support in independent production and the \u00a32bn generated for the UK economy will also be under threat. </p> <p>ITV has already abandoned most of its public service obligations. If Channel 4 is obliged by deteriorating finances to do the same, the BBC will be the sole meaningful provider. The market will not pick up the slack. Only a fully funded Channel 4 can guarantee ongoing competition to the BBC of real scale and impact - which is what the public demands.</p> <p>The board of Channel 4 is committed to preserving it as a public purpose organisation. The government has long dismissed the option of privatisation, recognising Channel 4 as a successful public/private hybrid and a cornerstone of the UK's creative industries. The Conservatives have also reiterated their opposition. Now political will must be turned into meaningful support. </p> <p>We are already having to cut spending on programmes by more than \u00a350m in response to the downturn. Ofcom has broadly accepted the size and timing of our gap and agrees a new funding mechanism is a 'pressing priority'. The government has indicated willingness to take decisions early in the new year. All that remains to be decided (urgently) is where new support for Channel 4 should be sourced. </p> <p>If we are given certainty about funding, we can release money from our reserves to restore our creative investment while we wait for a new mechanism to be implemented. Suddenly the transition from analogue adolescence to digital adulthood won't seem so daunting after all.</p>",
  "<p>Bank customers' epic legal battle to try to recover unfair charges for bouncing cheques and exceeding overdrafts has reached the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) estimated that banks take \u00a32.5bn from their customers in unauthorised charges every year. Cash explains the litigation so far and what it means to you.</p> <h2>What happened in court last week?</h2> <p>'This was the appeal as to whether the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 apply in the case of bank charges,' says Phil Jones, head of personal finance at consumer rights group Which?.</p> <p>Seven banks and one building society, together with the OFT, agreed to a test case after hundreds of thousands of frustrated bank customers attempted to reclaim money. It was first heard in January, when the High Court considered whether the OFT had the power to decide if the banks' current terms and conditions relating to charges were 'fair' under the regulations. In April the judge found that it did, meaning the watchdog can assess what amounts to a fair charge for entering into an unauthorised overdraft. This, consequently, would enable customers to claim money back. </p> <p>It is that decision the banks are now appealing. 'We are hopeful that the Court of Appeal will uphold January's judgment. If they don't, we'd expect to see the OFT appealing, which would see the case move on to the House of Lords,' says Jones. The appeal judges' ruling is expected in January.</p> <h2>Most consumer claims relate to older terms and conditions. What about them?</h2> <p>Separately, the High Court is expected to rule this month on whether historical terms and conditions are sufficiently similar to the present ones for the judgment to apply to all.</p> <h2>Anything else? </h2> <p>Yes, the High Court had also to establish whether unauthorised overdraft charges were 'penalties' under common law - that is, broadly speaking, charges that are arbitrary and penal rather than ones that broadly reflect the extra expense of going overdrawn. Earlier this month the court ruled they were not penalty charges. 'This means that, generally, consumers will have to rely on proving the terms are unfair if they are to get their money back,' explains Jones. This should not make claiming repayment any more difficult.</p> <h2>What about the credit crisis? Will the government's bail-out of the banks have an impact on charges?</h2> <p>'In terms of the fee structures for overdrafts, the issue is totally separate,' says Lesley McLeod of the British Bankers' Association. 'I do not think that our members see that there is any read-across.' </p> <p>The judges should decide 'on the basis of the law rather than the economic situation', says Jones. 'Stability is important in the banking system and we recognise that is the primary concern. We do not think there is a contradiction between having stable banking and treating customers fairly.'</p> <h2>What if you have a new claim? </h2> <p>The FSA has a waiver in place that covers nearly all UK banks and building societies, which means no claims will be settled until the end of this legal action. In the meantime, if you have had an unauthorised overdraft charge made against you, write to your bank and ask for your money back. For more information, check the FSA consumer website at <a href=\"http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk\">moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk</a>.</p> <h2>Do I need to instruct someone to handle my claim?</h2> <p>There are plenty of firms promising to recover charges on a 'no win, no fee' basis, but which may take up to 30 per cent of your compensation if you win. </p> <p>Two weeks ago a new company, Cartel Client Review, promised customers a free service. Carl Wright, its managing director, claims that his company will 'exploit other legal avenues' to enable customers to reclaim their cash and says they are 'in a unique position to bypass the clogged arteries of the County Court service and help return the cash seized by banks'. However, he refuses to expand any further for fear of giving up a commercial advantage. Which? is puzzled. 'We don't understand what the company is referring to,' says Jones. 'As far as we are aware there won't be any more payments unless and until the OFT wins its case and there are no more appeals.'</p> <p>He adds: 'Our view is that you do not need to use a claims management company. It is free and easy to do it yourself.' </p> <p>\u2022 Use our template letters to reclaim your unauthorised overdraft charges - visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/bankcharges\">theguardian.com/money/bankcharges</a> for further information</p>",
  "<p>America's most critically acclaimed drama, the Emmy award-winning Mad Men, has hit its first major hurdle with the news that series creator Matthew Weiner has not yet signed up for a third season of the show.</p> <p>A sharp-eyed look at sharp-suited advertising men in 1960s New York, Mad Men quickly established itself as cult viewing over the course of its first two series, the second of which is due to air in the UK on BBC4 in the new year. But producers face a battle to hold on to the man widely credited with its startling success.</p> <p>The stumbling block to a third season, inevitably, is money. Weiner, who oversees everything from scripts to ensuring that the photocopier in the corner of the Sterling Cooper office is the right brand for the era, spent the weeks after Mad Men won the Emmy for best drama in a series of meetings with the heads of major studios and networks to consider new projects. He is rumoured to have asked AMC, the channel on which Mad Men airs, for a multi-season deal worth $10m (\u00a36m) a year and control over promotion and advertising. </p> <p>It's the sort of package that HBO's big hitters such as Alan Ball, the man behind Six Feet Under and current hit True Blood, or David Chase, creator of The Sopranos (the show Weiner previously worked on) demand as a matter of course. But AMC is no HBO, and Lionsgate, the independent production company behind the show, while keen to tie Wiener into a two-year deal, is unwilling to splash that sort of cash.</p> <p>'We are currently in negotiations with Matthew Weiner,' a spokesman for Lionsgate told The Observer. 'We very much want to have him back but our first commitment is to the show and to ensuring that the quality remains the same in the next season.' He admitted that there were financial issues but refused to comment on rumours that the production company had already begun to sound out potential replacements, including West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin.</p> <p>Would Mad Men be Mad Men without Weiner? A notorious perfectionist, who admitted in an interview with the New York Times magazine that he fretted over every aspect of the show and was haunted by the rare errors that slipped through, Weiner has a reputation for being difficult to work with on occasion but there is little doubting that his obsession with detail is a large part of the reason for the drama's success.</p> <p>Mad Men's appeal lies not just in its strong acting and witty writing but in its uncanny re-creation of a particular era in American history, a time when men were men, women were curvaceous and the national pastime was proving that you could smoke a cigarette with elan. </p> <p>It is, in part, a collective nostalgia for this bygone time that has helped propel the show from cult favourite towards the cultural mainstream over the course of its second season. John Hamm, who plays Sterling Cooper's haunted creative genius Don Draper, hosted primetime sketch show Saturday Night Live last week, while tonight The Simpsons' Halloween episode will include a segment called 'How to Get Ahead in Dead-vertising' in which Homer slowly tumbles through the air past a number of advertising slogans in reference to Mad Men's Hitchcockian opening titles. Nor is it just television that is queuing up to pay homage to Sterling Cooper's advertising execs. A DVD of the first series was spotted next to presidential candidate Barack Obama on his campaign plane, fashion designer Michael Kors has called the drama an inspiration and the catwalks at New York fashion week were filled with the sort of brightly coloured and simply structured dresses that Sterling Cooper's voluptuous office manager Joan Holloway would be eager to wear.</p> <p>Small wonder that there are Facebook groups dedicated to asking 'What would Don Draper do?' or that every redhead in New York seems to have been planning to go as Holloway to this year's Halloween party.</p> <p>Weiner admitted recently that the show's breakout into the mainstream has surprised him. 'I had no foresight I would get articles sent to me from friends where it [Mad Men] has become an adjective or involved in the presidential election. And then there's the rest of it: \"Why don't we dress that way? Why don't people have better manners?\"'</p> <p>Yet for all that Mad Men has tapped into the current zeitgeist and, for all that it is loved by advertisers (in a way that perhaps only a programmes about advertising could be), its ratings remain tiny in comparison to the major network dramas such as House or CSI. On average, only 1.5 million people watch Mad Men, although the second season finale was seen by 2.9 million, a jump of 89 per cent on the previous series. </p> <p>It is this niche status that remains the sticking point regarding a third season. For while Mad Men is currently the most talked about show in America, it is by no means the most watched and any deal may reflect that. The question that Lionsgate must ask is whether Mad Men can survive without Weiner's influence.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 3 2008. The second series of Mad Men is due to air on BBC4 in the new year, not More4 as we originally said in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<h2>Terry Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote </h2> <p>One of the unluckiest directors in the business, Terry Gilliam leaves in his wake a trail of unrealised projects (A Tale of Two Cities, Watchmen) and semi-realised disasters, notably The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, which he started shooting in 1999. It was to be Gilliam's most ambitious film: he had spent 10 years developing it and started with a budget of $40m. Perhaps he should never have considered it, as Cervantes's knight has himself been luckless in cinema (Orson Welles obsessed over a movie about Quixote for years but couldn't finish it). In the screenplay by Tony Grisoni, Gilliam's regular collaborator, the Don mistakes a latter-day marketing executive adrift in time, played by Johnny Depp, for Sancho Panza. The shoot collapsed after just five days, beset by floods, fighter jets flying overhead (disastrous scouting had located the set next to a Spanish military base) and injuries: 69-year-old Jean Rochefort, who had learnt English to play the knight, developed a prostate infection, then a double-hernia, and had to fly back to Paris. All that remains are some intriguing chunks of footage and an entertaining documentary about the debacle, Lost in La Mancha, although Gilliam now appears to be bracing himself for another attempt.</p> <h2>Orson Welles's Heart of Darkness</h2> <p>Orson Welles's habit of abandoning projects developed early. His directorial debut was meant to be an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness in 1939. RKO offered the 24-year-old complete artistic control and he seized the offer with both hands. Conrad's novel, in Welles's hands, became an anti-fascist allegory - 'The picture,' he said, 'is, frankly, an attack on the Nazi system' - in spite of RKO's reluctance to engage in political issues at the time. He devised a highly ambitious - and impractical - plan to shoot the film from Marlow's point of view, keen that the story be told 'in an entirely new way'. (He admitted that the methodology was 'in the experimental stage'.) The projected budget soared to more than $1 million, twice what his contract permitted, and the film was put on hold. In the meantime, Welles agreed to do a low-budget thriller, The Smiler with a Knife, but neither film got made. Perhaps it was just as well: his debut, two years later, was Citizen Kane</p> <h2>Steven Spielberg's Night Skies</h2> <p>Spielberg conceived of aliens as benevolent in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and cute in ET (1982), but between the two films he developed a dark flipside to his vision. His treatment for Night Skies, based on a report on paranormal activity in Kentucky in 1955, portrayed extraterrestrial visitors as malevolent animal-mutilators wreaking havoc on a family farm: it was dubbed 'Straw Dogs with aliens'. Deciding that he would only produce the film, Spielberg asked John Sayles to flesh out his treatment, originally titled Watch the Skies, and direct. Sayles's screenplay opens with a nasty alien named Scar zapping farm animals with his skeletal finger. He also introduced a kindly alien named Buddy, who bonds with the family's young son (sound familiar?). Buddy inspired Spielberg to abandon the nastiness and get back to 'the tranquillity, or at least the spirituality, of Close Encounters' - and thus began ET. Night Skies came a cropper but the idea of a family terrorised by unnatural forces resurfaced in Poltergeist (1982), which Spielberg produced and co-wrote.</p> <h2>David Lynch's Ronnie Rocket</h2> <p>When David Lynch finally finished his brilliantly weird debut Eraserhead in 1977, he embarked on a project that had the potential to be even more bizarre. In Lynch's words, Ronnie Rocket is about 'the absurd mysteries of the strange forces of existence' and its title refers to 'a three-foot guy with red hair and physical problems'. Ronnie, who is electrified and in possession of a wondrous singing voice, gets kidnapped by a rock band. Meanwhile, a detective enters Ronnie's mind and stumbles into a strange, Kafka-esque city containing Ronnie's childhood home and a mysterious energy-draining machine. Lynch hoped that Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper would star, with Michael J Anderson, The Man From Another Place from Twin Peaks, playing Ronnie. The project was very close to the director's heart - perhaps too close: he spent many years revising the screenplay and, never quite satisfied, he forfeited several opportunities to film it. Rossellini and Hopper did get to share the screen in a Lynch film, memorably, in his 1986 masterpiece Blue Velvet</p> <h2>Stanley Kubrick's Napoleon</h2> <p>It could have been the crowning glory of Stanley Kubrick's career and one of the greatest war films ever made. The obsessive director spent two years in pre-production on a film spanning Napoleon Bonaparte's life, from birth to death, and amassed hundreds of books on the emperor in the process: they filled a library in his Hertfordshire home. He employed a team of researchers, wrote a lengthy script (which is now available online) and made plans to recreate numerous enormous battles, on the same battlefields upon which Napoleon had fought, without blowing a hole in the budget. The Romanian government was even prepared to loan tens of thousands of soldiers to the production at a very low rate. Jack Nicholson and Ian Holm were both considered for the lead role. Kubrick was riding high after the critical and commercial success of 2001, in 1968, but a spate of Napoleon films emerged during development, all of them box-office failures. MGM pulled the plug on the project and, though it lingered with him until his death in 1999, Kubrick's grand dream never became reality.</p> <h2>David Lean's Nostromo</h2> <p>David Lean's last great epic could have been Nostromo, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 1904 novel of corruption and greed in a fictional South American republic. But perfectionism, creative disputes, a spiralling budget, ill-health and finally Lean's death in 1991, six weeks before shooting was due to begin, prevented him from ever making it. Lean confessed that the novel bored him, so he engaged Christopher Hampton to help him modernise the story and 'make the audience sit up straight with surprise'. After a year, during which Steven Spielberg came on board as a producer, Lean replaced Hampton with Robert Bolt. He fell out with Spielberg, who had dared criticise the script, and then his health went into decline, as did Bolt's. Marlon Brando, Alec Guinness and Peter O'Toole were all connected with the film but none could fully commit. When Lean was finally satisfied with the script, several years later, the budget had shot up, and he died, frustrated, before he could finally set the epic in motion.</p>",
  "<p>This match has not been the ideal showcase for Test cricket. It would have been neat and timely if the perfect antidote to the grotesque lottery taking place in Antigua had been on view in Delhi, where India and Australia are contesting the third Test of a compelling series.</p> <p>But, after four gruelling days for bowlers, not enough wickets have been taken. With one day remaining and the home side leading by 79 runs with eight wickets in hand, the game is heading for a draw. There will be no generous declarations from Anil Kumble, whose side lead the four-match series 1-0, but there has been some brilliant cricket and, over the past two days, most of it has come from Australia.</p> <p>After India had amassed 613 for seven declared, the Australians had to bat brilliantly just to stay in the game - and on the third and fourth days they did. At Delhi, the pitch disintegrates as good pitches do, so batting was far less straightforward for the tourists. The carefree strokeplay that characterised the innings of Gautam Gambhir and VVS Laxman on the first two days was no longer possible. (Incidentally, Gambhir, the batsman of the series so far, has been banned for one Test after a spat with Shane Watson. The Indians are appealing against this decision, delivered by Chris 'Judge Jeffreys' Broad, but the appeal process causes a delay, which means Gambhir may be able to play in the final Test against Australia at Nagpur. He may, therefore, miss out against England in December.)</p> <p>So, the Australians grafted. They had no alternative. The ball was starting to turn, albeit slowly, as the puffs of dust became ever more prevalent. Yesterday, it was Michael Clarke who held the second half of the innings together, with 112. Had Ishant Sharma held on to a catch at mid-off when Clarke, on 21, drove at Amit Mishra, Australia might be on the verge of defeat this morning.</p> <p>Instead, Clarke soldiered on in handy alliances with Watson (36), Brad Haddin (17) and Cameron White (44) - this Australia side may lack depth and quality in their bowling attack, but they bat a long way down. Clarke was dropped twice more, in the nineties. But, by then, Australia were back in the game.</p> <p>The Indians were hampered by their poor catching and by injury. Harbhajan Singh would have been dangerous on this surface, but was not fit enough to start the match. Kumble damaged his left hand attempting a catch on Friday. He returned to the field yesterday, his injured hand swathed in bandages to protect his stitches, and he finally acquired his first wicket of the series when Haddin was stumped. Mishra, after a dream debut in Mohali, was given a reality check by Australian batsmen at their grittiest.</p> <p>So the Indians found themselves dependent on the off-spin of Virender Sehwag. He was easily the home side's most dangerous bowler, accurate and sometimes venomous. He bowled 40 overs and achieved his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Currently, he might play for Australia as a specialist spinner.</p> <p>Kumble picked up a couple of more wickets at the end, but looked a little grumpy. Having won the toss and seen his side stack up the runs, he would expect to be in a better position after four days. When he held the final catch, albeit with his damaged left hand, steely eyes betrayed his frustration that his colleagues, with two good hands, had not been able to hang on to vital chances earlier in the day.</p> <p>Kumble may also be perplexed about his bowling, which has not been as productive as usual in this series. After the Australia series, the Indians will have to plan the evolution of their side carefully. Kumble is now 38 and, as captain, is an automatic pick - but for how much longer? The Indians know they have a very capable replacement in the wings (actually he's behind the stumps - Mahendra Dhoni is ready to take over).</p> <p>However, India appear to be in good hands. Gary Kirsten, the new coach, gives credence to the view that the less you hear and see of the coach in cricket, the better he is likely to be.</p>",
  "<p>James Bond was defined in the age of rationing. Crucial to creator Ian Fleming's success was his adroit touch with luxury goods: the very things postwar Britain yearned for. The hero's personality is projected through clothes, drinks, cars and a certain brand of gun. The Observer's design critic Stephen Bayley looks at product placement in the new Bond film.</p> <p><strong>Aston Martin </strong></p> <p>Bond's first car was an interwar Bentley. Later Fleming imagined his hero in a Bentley R-type Continental. But 007 has an enduring association with Aston Martin. The Daniel Craig Bond drives an Aston Martin DBS. Like Fleming's hero, it's brutal and beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Ford Ka </strong></p> <p>To have the first sightings of Ford's new Ka (driven by the heroine) is a commercial coup commensurate in its way with Dr No's plans for world domination. Martin Smith's Ka now needs no advertising: 007 has got the account. Suburban Ka drivers can now enjoy a frisson of glamorous danger.</p> <p><strong>Douglas DC-3 </strong></p> <p>The Douglas DC-3 was the plane that made air travel democratic. In contrast to Bond's taste in cars, the DC-3 speaks of toughness and utility. Craig's Bond is more nuanced than Connery's. It makes sense, in these troubled times for luxury goods, to have him at the controls of one tough old warbird.</p>",
  "<p>The first frames of Barack Obama's half-hour 'infomercial' last Wednesday showed golden wheat waving in the sun, a familiar image of wholesomeness and the American heartland. You half expected to see Russell Crowe as the Gladiator - the slave, you remember, who challenged the Roman emperor - running his hands across bowed heads of corn; or perhaps the crash of the survival pod bringing Superman to the amber prairies of Kansas and a kindly farmer's home.</p> <p>Despite the noise of the stump and the constantly fascinating TV coverage, this election has a silent, mythic intensity. Beyond the hoopla, there is a deep and well-informed engagement with the issues and with the implications these have for the destiny of every American. </p> <p>You don't see it; last week, Halloween masks outnumbered bumper stickers and Obama buttons in New York State by at least a factor of 100. But you feel it when you talk to people, in my case to Carol, who cleans my hotel room, to the shoeshine man outside New York Public Library and to the lady who sold me a shirt. Carol wears a huge Obama watch on the inside of her wrist, the shirt saleswoman had an Obama button on the reverse of her lapel, and the old-time shoeshine man worried that a black man in the White House would stir up all sorts of trouble.</p> <p>New York is Hillary's home ground and is solidly Democratic; all these people are for Barack Obama but their support isn't blind. Democrats are used to being disappointed. There is a superstitious disinclination to assume anything but the worst will happen on Tuesday, despite the sense that Obama did indeed drop from the sky with all the powers of the unstained Supercandidate intact: poise, self-discipline, strategic intelligence, eloquence on stage and page, grace under pressure, stamina and empathy. </p> <p>When the McCain campaign says we don't know enough about this guy, you see what they mean, even though Obama has told us everything and at length.</p> <p>The engagement is palpable and support for Obama feels like the deep undertow of a heroic piece of music by Aaron Copland. I spent some time in the state Democratic headquarters watching rooms of volunteers on leave from their jobs, using their own mobile phones (free calls on weekends) and laptops to identify and muster supporters among an electorate that is vastly increased because of voter registration campaigns.</p> <p>Potential voters will be 'touched' (called and emailed) three times between now and the close of polls. The Democrats are stupendously well organised. When the space in their headquarters just off Wall Street is overflowing, supporters, alerted by a website, meet in ad hoc groups in hotels and bars and start phoning names on the list. The sheer number of volunteers means that New York Democrats supplement the Obama campaign in neighbouring states.</p> <p>Change is the word you hear and see most because that is what people want. But as Bill Clinton, who is still one of most gifted and shrewd political communicators around, pointed out on the stump in Iowa last Thursday, enormous change has occurred in the last eight years. He told his audience that America was 'more communitarian and diverse' and the Republicans just didn't get it. That seems true. After all, this is the culture that during the famine of the Bush years produced the unwavering social realism of The Wire, perhaps the first truly post-racial TV series. </p> <p>Clinton's old aide David Gergen, who was once a Republican, suggested on TV that with the increase in Hispanic population and Latino support for Obama running at two to one, there were the makings of a new Democratic coalition, on the lines of the one forged by Roosevelt. Other Republican commentators cannot hide their awe for the campaign: conservative Pat Buchanan said: 'A McCain White House would be chaotic.'</p> <p>Things have changed a lot since Jesse Jackson ran for President in 1984 and 1988 as the black candidate and weakened Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis in the process. His campaign came out of the civil rights movement and was exclusively black activist and seemed threatening because of that. Even though some voters today confess to supporting the white or black parts of Obama, it's important that he is running as the post-racial candidate and that his black supporters are collectively playing this election very cool. Writer and filmmaker Matt Tyrnauer, who worked for Mondale, put it this way: 'They can feel the tidal wave coming but rather than being on the crest of it they want to be swept along with it - black and white together.'</p> <p>That is why the election may produce something more than a photo finish with Obama just in the lead. At the end of last week, he had an 11-point poll lead, which would give him a clear lead in an electoral college that requires the winner to achieve at least 270. The weight of Obama's argument is so much more impressive than McCain's. He has a highly disciplined and well-financed campaign that hasn't put a foot wrong and it is impossible to underestimate the influence of the web in this first YouTube election, in which film and images are shared at will outside the control of the traditional media. </p> <p>Last week, Obama had both Clintons, Al Gore and the shrink-wrapped Joe Biden out there in the swing states, whereas McCain can only call on his own admirable tenacity, Sarah Palin, who has worked no lasting magic for him, and that mystifying national figure, Joe the Plumber, who failed to show up as planned at a McCain rally last week. </p> <p>You won't catch Democrats saying any of this because they are holding their breath and praying that nothing goes wrong in the next 48 hours, but as one famously corrupt mayor once said about his own election, unless Obama 'is caught with a dead girl or a live boy' he's home and dry. </p> <p>Something profound is happening. Whatever the robocalls allege about Obama's links to terrorism and his support for abortion, it's important to remember that a fifth of the electorate has already voted and though we have no definite figures it seems that most of those are Democrats. Late on Tuesday, we will see Barack Obama step into the cold winds of Chicago to accept the presidency and release a brief shockwave of hope. </p> <p>But Democrats will only believe it when they see it.</p>",
  "<p>People do lie to pollsters. Pollsters can screw up their measures of voting intention. Voting intentions can change in the frenetic last furlong before election day. The man himself constantly cautions the crowds at his final rallies to take nothing for granted. But the world now expects that the world will get what it wants: President Barack Obama. </p> <p>Just because this is increasingly anticipated, we should not discount how sensational that outcome will be. It will be an extraordinary victory for a novice senator born outside the continental United States who grew up with an absentee father and a peripatetic mother. To make it additionally astonishing, he is also a liberal, a northerner and a college professor - three categories long assumed to be unelectable as commander-in-chief. Oh, and did I mention that the pigmentation of his skin is not quite the same as that of George Washington and every President since? </p> <p>What if the world has been dreaming and wakes up on Wednesday to find that it is President McCain? The air will soon be thick with those opining that it was always a fantasy to think that the White House could be won by a neophyte who came out of nowhere with the middle name of Hussein. </p> <p>To the bitter end, John McCain will suggest that his rival is not qualified to sit in the Oval Office. And yet the gruelling business of an American presidential election is a qualification process in itself. It is many, many rollercoaster months since that victory in the Iowa primary when Obama started to confound the best laid grids of much more experienced rivals, to energise huge crowds and to mesmerise the world. Say what you don't like about the length and the expense of the presidential race, it does have the great merit of being the most intense audition for the job. </p> <p>You cannot entirely tell what a person will be like as President from the way he fought for the office, but it does offer useful pointers. It is one huge stress test of a candidate's temperament, ideas, judgment, strategic capacity, organisational skills and resilience. Take the last first. Initially and then repeatedly dismissed as a fashionable fad, a celebrity confection, Obama has proved that he is durable. To get here, the rookie senator has out-campaigned both the Republicans and the Clintons, besting America's two most formidable political machines by building from scratch an even better organisation of his own. At the climax, his campaign is so flush with donations that he can afford to buy 30 minutes of airtime in prime time across the networks while his opponent is running on empty and calling himself 'the underdog' to try to make a desperate virtue out of being behind. </p> <p>Among the people enthused by Obama are other politicians, not least those watching in some awe from this side of the Atlantic. It is a convention that British leaders do not take public sides in American presidential races, especially for fear of finding that they have backed the wrong horse. This cannot mask the excitement among Labour people at the prospect of an Obama presidency. That we'd expect. Labour and the Democrats are sister parties. More remarkable is the large number of Tories for Obama. John McCain had many admirers among British Conservatives. He was the international guest of honour at their conference not so long ago. But if David Cameron had a vote, it would not go to the Republican.</p> <p>The Tory leader can't say this publicly, but he has revealed to colleagues that he hopes the Democrat will win. There's the obvious and rather glib reason for this: an Obama victory would be a win for 'change' just as Cameron hopes to be. There's the less superficial reason which is that the Tory leader was hugely impressed by the intelligence and judgment of the other man when they met in London a few weeks ago. David Cameron remarked to allies that he was especially struck by Obama's self-composure at a time when the polls and the atmospherics were turning against him. 'He was just so incredibly cool,' the Tory leader told a friend. </p> <p>They call it no drama, Obama. After two years under the searing spotlight of the most saturated media in the world, there has not been a single occasion when he has publicly lost self-control. Nor has his organisation lapsed in its self-discipline. It is a testimony to his ability to select and lead a team that his campaign has been so smooth in comparison with those of his rivals. There has been none of the internecine warfare which riddled the Clinton campaign and is now erupting within the McCain camp even before they know for certain that they've lost. </p> <p>This has not meant that Obama's road to the White House has been free of potholes, prangs and the occasional moment when some thought he might end up in the ditch. There was the uproar over his remarks, made at an event he did not expect to be reported, about voters who cling to guns and God out of bitterness with their lot. He's also been taught that it is a bad idea to call a photo-op in a bowling alley if you are crap at bowling. </p> <p>Then there was the furore over Jeremiah Wright and the pastor's inflammatory 'God damn America' sermons. That was an incendiary moment which would have toasted a lesser candidate. It takes one of exceptional quality to turn crisis into opportunity which Obama did by responding with a brilliantly argued, compellingly personal and finely nuanced speech about race.</p> <p>Grace under pressure has been a consistently striking feature of his campaign. It has also been one of the big contrasts with his opponent. John McCain was handicapped by the huge burden of being the Republican candidate after eight years of George W Bush, a weight that he could never entirely lift however much distance he tried to put between himself and the hugely unpopular incumbent. </p> <p>Against that, we should not forget that Senator McCain also came to the contest with significant advantages over his opponent. The famous war hero, the grizzled and gutsy senate senior, a man long respected by people beyond his own party, on the face of it John McCain was the known quantity of the contest, the safe and sound choice for Americans at a time when they are fighting two wars abroad and there is an economic crisis at home. </p> <p>McCain's attack ads asked: 'Do you really know Barack Obama?' And yet it is to the Republican that the bigger question marks are now attached. In the debates between them and the campaign exchanges since, it is Obama who has come over as the nerveless, reassuring, sober, mature and authoritative one, the presidential one. It is John McCain, frantically switching tactics and snatching after headlines to try to get traction in the contest, who has come over as the impetuous, angry, adolescent, erratic one, the unpresidential one. </p> <p>That was most epitomised by his reckless choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate having met the Alaskan governor just twice. Like a star going nova, she dazzled for a brief moment when she first exploded on the scene only to implode into a black hole of national ridicule after some excruciatingly and alarmingly bad performances in interviews. </p> <p>This was the point when many British Conservatives lost faith in the American one. For them, as for many other people, it called into question what kind of calculation would animate a McCain presidency. The ability to dress a shot moose is not sufficient qualification to occupy the most powerful seat in the world. By putting Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency of a septuagenarian, John McCain was simply not being serious enough about the responsibilities of leadership.</p> <p>The result is that it is the veteran senator from Arizona who looks like the riskier choice than the freshman senator from Illinois. </p> <p>It is undeniable that Barack Obama's promises are much bigger than his experience. One thing that particularly impresses me is that he knows what he doesn't know. He has the confidence to acknowledge his deficits in experience and expertise by gathering around him a pretty stellar cast of advisers on both foreign and domestic policy. Of course, that does not in itself guarantee a successful time in the White House. A President also needs the capacity to understand the advice he is given and to choose between competing counsels. From what we have seen of Obama, he has that capacity. He is analytical, pragmatic, open-minded, considered and subtle - qualities all notable by their absence from the White House during the last eight years. Joe Klein puts it very well: 'He seems a grown-up, in a nation that badly needs some adult supervision.'</p> <p>Last, but far from least, Barack Obama has been true to himself. During 21 months of epic drama on this long road, he has never deviated from his essential vision and his core strategy. He ends the race as he began it, offering a positive prospectus of reconciliation, moderation and change.</p> <p>Politicians in Britain and the world over will try to emulate him by borrowing his slogans, plagiarising his rhetoric, copying his fund-raising techniques and all the rest of it. Those are the small lessons of his success. The big lesson is that the politics of unity and hope can still beat those of division and fear. At least, the world is united in hoping so.</p>"
