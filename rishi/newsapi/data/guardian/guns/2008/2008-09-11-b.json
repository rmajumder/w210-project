  "<p>If there is a symbol of Kabul \u2013 beyond the burqa and the fast-disappearing but much-photographed ruined houses in the west of the city \u2013 it is the kite. Banned by the Taliban, popularised by Khaled Hosseini's book the Kite Runner, Kabul's kites are little more than salvaged plastic bags taped to thin bits of wood. But they dip and soar in even the worst sandstorms above the city, over refugee camps, over the poorest outlying villages. Under the Taliban, they were one of the things that local people used to tell the rare reporters in their city that they missed the most. Now Kabulis fear the kites may disappear again. For the Taliban are at the gates of Kabul once more.</p> <p>Najib Samib and Said Ahmed, two psychology students, stand in the grounds on the renovated Kabul university campus. A decade ago, the complex was a wasteland of semi-derelict buildings. There were few books and fewer teachers. I had lunch there once with the Taliban cleric in charge. We sat on the floor in his office eating boiled spinach, rice and mutton. He had been educated in a conservative madrassa and saw western-style education as a threat \u2013 though he reluctantly admitted the country needed doctors and engineers. Outside a handful of students lingered in the overgrown gardens. Today the scene is transformed. </p> <p>But the two students are worried and Ahmed says that for the first time since coming back to Kabul from Iran in 2002 he is wondering if he will have to leave again. \"If it gets worse then we will have to leave, go to neighbouring countries,\" he says. \"I don't know. It's pretty depressing.\" </p> <p>For, though transformed by a wave of returning refugees, an extraordinary boom in telecommunications, massive reconstruction and unprecedented commercial activity, Kabul is now a worried city. The massive presence of foreign troops does little to allay the disquiet. \"I have the feeling that we are living on borrowed time,\" said a businessman as he walked with his three children in a park opened recently by an NGO on what was previously mined wasteland. </p> <p>For those who knew Afghanistan under the Taliban, the sight of a family walking in a park is still striking. Back then, the city had been stripped of most of its population. Traffic was virtually nonexistent \u2013 a stark contrast to the jams of today \u2013 and few ventured out if they did not need to. Many were simply too hungry to waste energy on an activity as aimless as walking when staying warm was already tough enough. Another risk was the Taliban religious police. Foreigners in the city were few. Only the AFP news agency had a western correspondent permanently in the city. There were just a handful of aid agencies. All visiting reporters had to stay in the semi-derelict InterContinental hotel where, even as late as the summer of 2001, the names of all the guests over the previous half-decade could be read on four pages of the reception ledger. There was little commercial activity, less power and the occasional rocket killed might kill a couple or a half dozen - or no one at all, because the streets and the bazaars were often empty. Women and girls stayed at home unable either to work or go to school. </p> <p>Now Kabulis fear for their futures. First they are worried about the attacks within the city \u2013 a series of bloody suicide bombings have killed scores of locals and led to massive security precautions. Main roads throughout Kabul have been closed, causing much local resentment. Double or even treble rows of blast walls now protect government buildings and embassies. They cost $350 or $500 a piece and the only person who is happy about the rate at which they sell owns the company that makes them on. And even he told me he wished business wasn't so good. The strict security precautions taken by diplomats, aidworkers and even the heavily armed soldiers means the international community is almost entirely cut off from the local people \u2013 as the insurgents intended. </p> <p>And then there is the sense that the vicious war in the provinces will eventually reach the city. </p> <p>One striking element is the clear parallel with the Soviet period. Recently I found a cutting from the French newspaper Le Figaro from 1988 headlined \"Insurgents move to cut off Kabul's supply routes\". These days the roads to the south and the east of Kabul are dangerous. \"If you are from the Afghan military, police or government or an aid worker or westerner and you drive [the road to Kandahar], you will get hit,\" said one senior UN official. On the road east to Jalalabad militants have progressed from shooting up convoys to mounting temporary checkpoints. Off the main highways, at least in those areas dominated by the Pashtun tribes, many rural zones are under de facto Taliban control. No one moves at night.</p> <p>Various elements reflect the Soviet times. It was the violent reaction to attempts to \"modernise\" the reactionary rural zones of Afghanistan that so destabilised the dogmatically Communist government in the late 70s that Moscow felt it necessary to send more and more troops. The Soviets soon found their logistics lines into the capital restricted simply to one route running north \u2013 those to the east and south severed by the mujahideen. The gulf between a secure and relatively prosperous Kabul and the desperately poor, war-torn provinces was one of the key dynamics in the chaotic civil war that followed the Soviets withdrawal - and in the emergence of the Taliban. </p> <p>The parallel with the 80s can be overdone \u2013 the fighting remains much more limited in extent and there is no threat to the supply route north. But recently, both American and French military officials have started relating stories of how the militants have tortured captured soldiers, killing them slowly and mutilating their corpses. The stories are almost identical to those told by the Soviets - and those recounted by Rudyard Kipling over a century ago when other western soldiers tried to shape Afghanistan according to a distant capital's imperial will. </p> <p>As ever, the losers are those caught in the middle. When a suicide bomber attacked a British convoy last month and killed one soldier, a 36-year-old truck driver called Mir Alam was caught by the blast. Reports of the incident in the UK focussed naturally enough on the dead British soldier. Mir Alam, a hardworking, cheery, decent father and husband has not featured in any report. He left a widow and four children that his only brother will have trouble looking after on his paltry government salary. \"If Isaf and everyone leave then Afghanistan will get worse but if Isaf were not here then my brother would be alive,\" he said. \"I don't now the answer.\" </p> <p>From senior officials in the aid or diplomatic community through to the Kabulis themselves, everyone agrees that things are a) very bad and b) that a total overhaul of strategy is necessary. </p> <p>But in Afghanistan right now, questions outnumber the responses 10 to one.</p>",

  "<p>The best thing about the triumph was its defects. A relentless Fabio Capello will be happy in the knowledge that plenty of work is still needed, with all the improvement that implies. This 4-1 defeat of Croatia was not a night when everything dropped serendipitously into place.</p> <p>Imperfections jutted out and a supporter would have been fatalistic if told that David James would get into trouble at crosses, that Ashley Cole would stagger as Darijo Srna and others drove at him, that Joe Cole would drop out of view and that Wayne Rooney's unreflecting desire to help would see him concede a foul near England's penalty area.</p> <p>Several of the faults were fleeting, but some proved slower to fade. The irreproachable factor was England's attitude. There were spells when the competitiveness, for example, lay in the determination of Rio Ferdinand and John Terry to impose their will. All over the pitch there was an insistence on having the last word. Capello stresses that his players have much to lose. \"I just say to the players that it is their second cap,\" he explained. Nothing that happened before the qualifiers with Andorra and, now, Croatia is deemed to matter.</p> <p>A few members of the opposition on Wednesday cannot count on being in the first team for their clubs, yet still this generation had extended the sequence of unbeaten qualifiers at the Maksimir Stadium that began in 1994. England set about showing Slaven Bilic's side that those inner resources were exhausted.</p> <p>His team was powerless to stop Theo Walcott, whose shrewd elevation to the first team must now have brought complete trust in Capello's judgment. The hat-trick contained ruthless finishing that was more of a surprise than the speed on the right that so unsettled Danijel Pranjic, a full-back who wants to overlap.</p> <p>Walcott himself will henceforth be shadowed by his own celebrity. \"I know,\" agreed an amused Capello. \"We have created a problem for Arsenal, not for me. Theo is young with a good future, but we have to help him. At this moment when all the people in newspapers and television are talking about the team we have to keep our feet on the ground.\"</p> <p>He draws a parallel with his confidence in Ra\u00fal during his first stint as Real Madrid manager, in 1996. Like Walcott now, the Spaniard was then 19, but Capello is sure that the challenge presented to the Arsenal player is of a higher order. \"The national team is different,\" he said. \"If you decide to put one of the young players in the national team it is sometimes a worry for the player, not for the manager. This time it was good.\" It is heartening for Capello that Walcott should be under the control of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the teenager was edgy at the outset but did not have his anxieties compounded by an intimidatory atmosphere. The fire in the hearts of the crowd had been banked in comparison with the emotional conflagration when England were last at the stadium, for the 2-0 loss in 2006. While the atmosphere was exciting, it was not intimidatory. With 20 minutes gone Srna was clapping his hands and imploring supporters to increase the volume. The match was goalless then, but Croatia sensed trouble ahead. They were the ones with the brittle temperament.</p> <p>England were only 1-0 in front when Robert Kovac was dismissed for the reckless smashing of an elbow into the head of Joe Cole, but the physicality was the expression of a panic already entrenched in Croatian ranks. There was a calm to Capello's team. It registered in England's hogging of 61% of the possession. The side is not supreme because of one result and there will be setbacks to come, but maybe Capello will outdo his predecessors by getting the players to perform as reliably as they do for their clubs.</p> <p>The manager reports that there have been discussions daily with the players during training. \"Usually [with clubs] I am trying to change something over one month,\" he said. \"I tried to change something with England over 10 days. I saw something this evening.</p> <p>\"Confidence, this was the problem. If a player is good for his club then he has to prepare the same way for the national team. I said that we would play better away from Wembley. I hope this game will help the national team and also we need the help of the supporters.\"</p> <p>An outcome of Wednesday's sort strengthens Capello's hand. How, for example, can the injured Steven Gerrard assume after this that he will be reinstated for the next World Cup qualifier, against Kazakhstan at Wembley on October 11? The manager, too, takes nothing for granted. As with so many of the dominant figures in his profession, he was already detaching himself from an outstanding win while everyone else wanted to cling to it.</p> <p>How he would have hated to hear the talk start of England's chances at the 2010 World Cup. His own frame of mind is unyielding in its practicality. \"For me,\" Capello said, \"there is only the result. We have six points, like Ukraine.\" He is probably in earnest when he promises that everyone is forever on trial. \"When I choose the squad I pick the best player at that moment,\" Capello insisted. It might have been footballers fearing for their own futures who scared the wits out of Croatia.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337537175\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Robert Mugabe yesterday agreed to surrender day-to-day control of the government and much of his power in a historic deal with his opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, to end Zimbabwe's long political crisis. But the agreement fell short of Tsvangirai's demand for Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader since independence 28 years ago, to become solely a ceremonial president after losing the last credible election six months ago.</p> <p>The deal is also expected to result in a de facto amnesty for the military and Zanu-PF party leaders responsible for the bloody campaign against opposition supporters and activists over recent months. Their attempt to overturn Tsvangirai's election victory in March left hundreds dead and thousands badly injured.</p> <p>Precise details of how power will be divided under the agreement, which has been mediated by South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, will be formally released at a signing ceremony on Monday. </p> <p>But according to opposition sources, Tsvangirai will become prime minister at the head of a council of ministers, the principal organ of government, which will be drawn from his Movement for Democratic Change and the president's Zanu-PF party. Mugabe will remain president and continue to chair a cabinet that opposition sources say will be a largely consultative body. The real power will lie with Tsvangirai.</p> <p>Mbeki, who has staked his dwindling political reputation on brokering a deal, heralded the agreement. \"I am absolutely certain that the leadership of Zimbabwe is committed to implementing these agreements,\" he said.</p> <p>British reaction was muted last night, with the government waiting to see the detail of the deal. \"We are following the situation closely,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman. \"We look forward to seeing the detail of the agreement announced by President Mbeki this evening. Our overriding concern is the welfare of the Zimbabwean people.\"</p> <p>If the agreement results in a real shift in power, it is likely to unlock the hundreds of millions of pounds in foreign aid desperately needed to shore up Zimbabwe's economy, which is collapsing under the weight of hyperinflation, a key factor in Mugabe conceding authority.</p>",
  "<p>I know you shouldn't bore people by telling them about your dreams, because there are few things more dull than the half-baked ramblings of someone else's subconscious, but will you humour me this once? Last Saturday night, when I had just arrived at New York fashion week, and the tail end of Hurricane Hanna was lashing rain against my hotel-room window, I dreamed I was at Mount Rushmore. It was raining there, too, but through the downpour I could see that the face looming above me was not Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln or Roosevelt, but Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Apologies if I'm giving you nightmares. But the reason I am telling you all this is that on the New York catwalks this week, it sometimes felt as if - in the world of New York fashion, at least - my dream had come halfway true. Only it was not just Palin, but a first-lady-meets-VP girl gang looming over us: the invisible presence of Michelle Obama, Cindy McCain and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The sky-high profile of women in American politics this year has seeped into the fashion consciousness. Washington is influencing the aesthetic as never before. Never mind the Barack Obama pin (although there are plenty of those too among the fashion crowd), the political style statement du jour among show-goers in Bryant Park, the official catwalk venue, is a purple power shift (very Michelle), or a Cindy-esque updo (chic or control freak, depending on your point of view). </p> <p>Curtis Sittenfeld's novel, American Wife, based with scandalous transparency on the life of Laura Bush, is prominently displayed in Manhattan bookstores right now. The glossy cover focuses not on a face, but on clothes: a ball dress and starched white evening gloves. The window-display prominence of the book reflects America's current obsession with first ladies and the position as powerful but supportive, humanising but enigmatic right-hand-woman that Michelle, Cindy and Sarah all occupy - and that Hillary has, to a lesser extent, now returned to. </p> <p>Obsession with first ladies and their like is not a purely American phenomenon. Carla Bruni's dove-grey and violet Dior wardrobe for her visit to Britain in March was one of the biggest fashion stories of the year; in July, it was the turn of Samantha Cameron's Cornish beach-wear to be decoded, stitch by stitch. We deduce a great deal of what (we think) we know about these women from what they wear. I suspect this may not have been what feminists originally meant by the personal being political, but there you go.</p> <p>What this means in terms of steering the direction of fashion is that femininity - in its American form as wholesome, healthsome and sunshine-bright, rather than the European incarnation as complicated, mysterious, troublesome and flouncy - once again rules the catwalk. The seeds of androgyny and sci-fi futurism sown in so many of last season's influential shows have fallen on unfriendly ground here. There was a clear sartorial divide, this week, among the show audiences who parade around the venue between pre sentations: while the Europeans are embracing sharp black tailoring and challenging trouser shapes, the Americans are all about an uptown citrus shift (think Cindy) or a cute floral leavened with a black belt (pure Michelle). </p> <p>Marc Jacobs' show, played out against the jazzy bombast of Gershwin's American classic Rhapsody in Blue, was inspired by \"women and Americana\", he said backstage. \"Country girls and city girls, Broadway girls and naive hometown girls - all my heroines.\" The words, surely, of a man who has been watching CNN. The catwalk, laid out as a hall of tall, slender mirrors even reminded me of Obama's much-derided Doric columns in Denver. Behind the mash-up presentation was a very elegant, grown-up silhouette: even Agyness Deyn, the eternal pixie, looked womanly in her little slanted hat. </p> <p>The dress and the single-colour suit were everywhere this week. At Carolina Herrera, bold, single-colour gowns in camera-friendly shades of yellow, scarlet and sky blue had triumphally garlanded necklines. Michael Kors did very Jackie-O shift dresses and A-line coats in shantung silk. At Derek Lam, the line was softer and more ruffled, an offbeat, downtown version of the look, but still with a clean all-American feel: simple belted shirtdresses and a draped, above-the-knee dress so lemony you could almost smell the zest. Preen was more hard-edged and sexed-up, but still featured a sheer, layered white knee-length frock with sweetly curved neckline and prim belted waist.</p> <p>Diane von Furstenberg, all daisies and smocking and ingenue-ish, was a little too ickle-girly for some tastes (by which, obviously, I mean mine). But the three-piece, Bianca Jagger-esque white trousersuit was chic enough to obliterate all memories of Hillary's tangerine suit. (Von Furstenberg and Hillary are good friends. Perhaps Von Furstenberg could have a quiet word.) The next DVF project? A range of T-shirts for the Obama campaign. </p> <p>Matthew Williamson opened with a fuchsia shantung silk trousersuit, which proved that the colourful trousersuit can turn heads for all the right reasons. Williamson, who is soon to open a store in New York, has sharpened up his aesthetic for his American audience: clean, sporty lines and lots of punchy accessories. Williamson has a genius for print and this season's offerings - one seemed to be a computer-graphic rendering of a peacock feather, another a graffiti/paisley blend - were spot-on. </p> <p>Like Matthew Williamson, DKNY is aimed at a youthful market that does not want to look too little-girlish. This was DKNY in its black-and-yellow, parkas-and-minis incarnation rather than the retro college girl, Ali McGraw guise it sometimes takes on. I prefer this version - or I would if I had the legs for it. </p> <p>Jonathan Saunders was one of my highlights of the week. When he first showed in New York, he came over a little bit too neutral, a little too understated, a little too Narciso Rodriguez. It felt like the energy drained away along with the colour. This collection came roaring back to life - if at times the short, full-skirted dresses were a little too Disney Princess in their exuberance, the long gowns were a masterclass in elegance. </p> <p>The packed-to-the-rafters Thakoon show was direct evidence of the first-lady obsession: the label has been on everyone's lips ever since Michelle Obama unexpectedly wore a floral Thakoon shift dress on stage with her husband. (The first the designer knew about this was when he saw it on TV.) This season went a little raunchy for conservative American tastes - I can't see Michelle ordering the buff fishnet organza apron dress - but the red rose-print frocks looked set to be a hit. </p> <p>It is a measure of how much Victoria Beckham's aesthetic has changed since the days of Wag-ish hair extensions and spray-on T-shirts that her dress collection blended seamlessly with the mood of the week. The Beckham dresses are a Beverly Hills version of the first-lady look - tighter and more body-conscious, but still with a conservative core. And check out Mrs B's argument for the logic of wearing a corseted dress (with a neck-to-calf zip up the back) for daywear: \"We're all so hectic, working and chasing our kids around and everything else, that a dress makes sense because you step into it, and you're done. And if you need to run, you can just undo the zip at the bottom and go.\" Brilliantly everywoman in an overachieving, airbrushed kind of a way.

  "<p>Ten years ago, the idea that the head of Greenpeace could sit down at a banquet for the rainforest with the Prince of Wales and David Attenborough, along with ministers and some of the world's richest people, would have been inconceivable. But John Sauven, the head of the environment group that came close to being proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the US only a few years ago, was at Mansion House in the City of London on Wednesday night, sipping port and chatting about carbon credits and the intricacies of climate change policy with the men who control trillions of dollars. </p> <p>It is a measure of how far the environment has reached the inner halls of the establishment that Sauven should have been invited at all and was not to be found at a far more raucous celebration party being held a few miles away. Four hours earlier, after an eight-day trial in Maidstone, Kent, a jury of nine men and three women had found two Greenpeace staffers and four volunteers not guilty of criminally damaging the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station, the 200m tall smokestack of which they had scaled in a climate change protest last October. </p> <p>There was a heady atmosphere of money and power at the banquet, but a far greater drama had been played out in the crown court. The world's leading climate scientist had come from the US to give evidence and if the group had lost, two of them would almost certainly have gone to prison and become the UK's first climate change martyrs. A guilty verdict could have also seriously dented the growing climate change protest movement and it is quite likely that the government would have given permission at the earliest opportunity for a new power station to be built at Kingsnorth. </p> <p>In fact, the verdict was a real shock for government, the coal industry and Kingsnorth's German owners. John Hutton, the energy secretary, has, with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR), been strongly backing a major expansion of the UK coal industry against fierce opposition from the former environment secretary David Miliband, and the current one, Hilary Benn. Until now, the pendulum has leaned slightly towards Hutton, who has argued that more UK coal is vital if we are to keep the lights on, and that climate change can be dealt with later by others. But the cabinet is split, and Gordon Brown has put off making any firm decision on expansion. </p> <p>The Maidstone verdict has changed all that and could prove a turning point both for the protest movement and industrial policy. It gave the clear political message that 12 people with - one must assume - no great scientific knowledge, had listened to the evidence of one of the best scientists in the world and concluded that climate change is now so serious and so urgent an issue that it is legally justifiable for people to invade a power station and do \u00a330,000 worth of damage. </p> <p>Out of the blue, the environmentalists say, the legitimacy of the government to pursue an expanding coal policy has been undermined and it may have become impossible for E.ON, the German owners of Kingsnorth, to go ahead with a new plant without fitting a \u00a3500m carbon capture and storage plant to collect and dispose of the greenhouse gases. </p> <p>What is particularly galling for the backers of coal-fired power stations is that, because of the amount of damage alleged to have been done at Kingsnorth, the case went to a jury rather than a magistrate. The crown prosecution service and many corporations know that campaigners who challenge the law by non-violent action are being regularly acquitted by juries. In the past decade, prosecutions of protesters against GM crops, incinerators, new roads and nuclear, chemical and arms trade companies have all collapsed after defendants argued that they had acted according to their consciences and that they were trying to prevent a greater crime. Greenpeace itself has a four-nil record against the crown using the same defence and was widely known to be seeking a jury trial to present complex arguments about coal and climate change.</p> <p>\"They were pretty confident that a jury would listen to them more than the government,\" said one lawyer yesterday. \"It gives them a platform. I doubt that we will see another climate change jury trial for many years.\"</p> <p>\"We are seeing a pattern emerging. The public is increasingly speaking through the courts,\" says Martyn Day, a partner with Leigh Day solicitors, which specialises in environmental cases. \"These cases are a good guide to public mood and politicians should take close heed of them. It shows that society is greatly concerned about what is happening with the environment and that it is suspicious of government and business when they say they are acting responsibly. </p> <p>\"We're looking at a society which is far more in tune with the environment than in the past. Politicians and companies have not understood that most people now understand the issues. There's a feeling that government and the authorities have not been paying sufficient heed, and that the courts are righting the balance,\" he said.</p> <p>Climate change activists hope now that the floodgates have been opened and that it will be open season on coal and other dirty energy industries. Hundreds of people have already pledged to take direct action against any expansion of the industry and the Maidstone case is expected to inspire copycat actions around the country. History would suggest that the carbon protest movement will gain in confidence like the anti-roads and GM movements, and that coal will be targeted mercilessly. </p> <p>Some groups could not even wait for yesterday's verdict. Even as the jury was deliberating on Wednesday afternoon in Maidstone, Welsh climate change activists along with angry villagers invaded the Hilton hotel in Cardiff where directors of an open-cast mine were meeting. </p> <p>It's odds on the Welsh activists will not be given a jury trial, and they certainly won't be invited to the next banquet in Mansion House.</p>",
  "<p>David Chipp, the former editor-in-chief of the Press Association, who has died aged 81, was one of those rare journalists who combined a talent for reporting with leadership skills, unruffled organisational abilities and an aptitude for diplomacy. Added to these was a highly developed sense of humour and a memory for detail that made him a wonderful lunch companion at the Garrick in recent years.</p> <p>As he recounted endless anecdotes of reporting exploits during his days in China or his industrial relations problems at PA, his eyes twinkled as if to suggest that he always knew more than he was revealing. And he probably did.</p> <p>He often said he was saving all the best bits for his memoirs, which he had been writing for ages, often explaining that he would write faster if he was given a deadline. One friend believes he may well have left a mighty tome. It might also prove to be a valuable historical record. For the best part of 40 years, he met and mixed with the great and the good, and was on first-name terms with prime ministers, judges, military leaders and leading actors.</p> <p>Chipp was born in Kew, Surrey, but was educated in Australia, at Geelong grammar school in Victoria, the alma mater of Rupert Murdoch. Though Murdoch was four years younger, Chipp always claimed to remember him as a contemporary.</p> <p>Chipp was only 17 when he returned to Britain, but managed to join the Middlesex Regiment before the end of the second world war, serving for three years before going up to King's College, Cambridge, in 1947 and graduating in history. Within a year he joined Reuters, firstly as a sports reporter, until he was sent to south-east Asia and opened a Reuters bureau in Rangoon, Burma.</p> <p>In 1956 he became the first non-communist journalist based in Peking (now Beijing) and later wrote a memoir of his adventures there, entitled The Day I Stepped on Mao's Toes. Backing into Mao Zedong at a reception was not the reason Chipp was recalled by Reuters to London in 1960 to begin a rise that led to his becoming the agency's editor in 1968.</p> <p>By now Chipp's reputation as a reporter who could manage, and a manager who respected reporters, had spread. So, after a year in editorial control at Reuters, he was asked by Lord Barnetson, then a director of both agencies, to take the job as editor-in-chief of the floundering Press Association (PA).</p> <p>Chipp rose to the challenge. He helped to raise its profile, expanding coverage to serve national titles as well as the regional press. He also ensured that the output was up to scratch, appointing better executives.</p> <p>He remained a reporter's reporter throughout, fighting for the rights of journalists to report freely, railing against the parliamentary lobby system and playing a key role in ensuring that more reporters were sent to cover the Falklands war than the government wished. He was also mischievous. When the Labour MP Dennis Skinner accused PA of rightwing bias and seeking to undermine the then Labour government and trade unions, Chipp ran Skinner's statement in full but added his own comment: \"We have issued this drivel from Skinner because otherwise he would accuse us of censorship. His accusation is an insult to every journalist working for PA.\"</p> <p>Chipp's professionalism was high-lighted in 1979 when PA's editorial staff were called out by the National Union of Journalists during a provincial pay strike. Though many senior journalists worked on, the then powerful print union, the National Graphical Association, insisted that every story must pass through the editor-in-chief's hands before they would transmit it. This involved Chipp subediting and initialling the copy, which meant that he had to work round the clock for the best part of seven weeks.</p> <p>He snatched some sleep in a nearby flat and took lunch at the Garrick. But he kept the news flowing to the agency's clients. \"I did the lot,\" he said later, \"parliamentary reports, court reports, racing results, everything.\" Newspaper proprietors remained ever grateful to Chipp for his efforts, and the majority of his staff were impressed too.</p> <p>After retiring from PA in 1986, he was offered a host of positions, becoming an independent director of the Observer, joining the boards of TV-am and Teletext, and working tirelessly for the Reuters Foundation and the Commonwealth Press Union.</p> <p>He was a founding member of the Press Complaints Commission and is fondly remembered by its youthful first director, Mark Bolland, for introducing him to his wide range of political contacts. He also proved to be a wise counsel during the PCC's early, turbulent period.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chipp was able to enjoy his passion for rowing, as a spectator and steward at the Henley regatta, and opera. But conversation was his forte. He loved to tell stories and pass on gossip. He was a mainstay of the regular meetings of ex-editors at the Garrick, known as the Old Codgers. No one could top a Chipp anecdote.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Allan Chipp, journalist, born June 6 1927; died September 8 2008</p>",
  "<p>Rather than an album of doggerel for Crufts-lovers, Rex the Dog's debut is a crunchy, 45-minute set of party-time electro. The person behind the pooch is Jake Williams, who last pumped up the charts as JX, with the 1994 handbag house hit, Son of a Gun. The intervening years have pushed him towards vintage synthesisers, as well as sketchily drawn cartoon pseudonyms, and some of these Korg-heavy tracks work well. Prototype and Italian Skyline are nicely sharp bites of futuristic pop, while I Can See You, Can You See Me? crackles with the menace of the best 80s techno. Rex's remixes of the Knife's Heartbeats and the Sounds' Tony the Beat jerk the limbs, too. He needs more of these next time, and fewer of the irksome references to dogs in the lyrics.</p>",
  "<p>In his long and playful partnership with saxophonist Gilad Atzmon, a recent and more delicate one with piano virtuoso John Law, and in many other settings from improv to fusion, Asaf Sirkis keeps confirming that he is one of the most creative drummers on the British jazz scene. Law has said that the way Sirkis just touches a cymbal is an inspiration. As a leader, however, Sirkis isn't quite so startling. This set moves between dramatic, slow-burn guitar chords and ostinatos set against thunderous drumming (reminiscent of the 1970s Mahavishnu Orchestra), a more sensuously grooving Joe Zawinul feel (supplied by guest keyboardist Gary Husband), and extended passages of speculative atmospherics for Tassos Spiliotopoulos's guitar. The leader's responses to the ideas around him are dazzling explosions of tom-tom patterns and spinetingling cymbal accents. While the group intensity is often compelling, there are also rather unfocused, loose-jam episodes, in a genre inviting memorable hooks that don't quite emerge.</p>",
  "<p>An investment bank only has a future if the market - clients, counter-parties, staff, regulators - has confidence in it. Lehman Brothers yesterday saw its shares fall 40% in early trading on Wall Street, an unmistakable vote of no confidence in the firm's self-help survival plan outlined on Wednesday. The market is guessing that Lehman will be taken over at a knock-down price, probably within days.</p> <p>The market could be wrong, but its record on these matters is excellent. The pattern of events resembles what we saw at Countrywide Financial, Bear Stearns, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In each case, there was an attempt by the company, or the financial authorities, to shore up defences. In each case, the pace of events became overwhelming.</p> <p>Lehman's mistake - or misfortune, if you're very generous - was to present a survival plan that required too much time to achieve its goal. Spin off the toxic real estate assets into a separate vehicle? Nice idea, but you have to write a prospectus, persuade the market that the valuations are fair, and then arrange financing. Sell a 55% stake in the fund management business? Yes, but who is the buyer, what is the price, and when do you get the cash?</p> <p>These questions could have been dodged if Lehman had been able to demonstrate support in the form of outside capital immediately. But Korea Development Bank said no. </p> <p>We don't know why. But if Dick Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, was guilty of believing that his business was being undervalued, he would also be following past events - Bear Stearns' management thought the same.</p> <p>In fact, at yesterday's market value of only $3bn, Lehman probably is worth more to a big, better-capitalised bank. But that's the point: you need capital to win confidence in these markets. If a bank cannot demonstrate that it has access to it, it is vulnerable. </p> <h2>Somebody must pay</h2> <p>So you think the government should intervene in the mortgage market? Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, has a message for you: try if you wish, but don't pretend that the policy is without cost and don't think that it is guaranteed to succeed. And certainly don't look to the Bank for assistance, because that is not its job and nor does it have the money.</p> <p>King's stance will dismay the heads of one or two clearing banks, who had hoped that the Bank's special liquidity regime, backed by the Treasury, would be extended beyond October 21. King is sticking by the deadline and his replacement facility will be a more modest affair: banks will be able to swap illiquid mortgage assets for Treasury bills for short periods with the aim of smoothing \"the adjustment of financial institutions hit by unexpected shocks\".</p> <p>In other words, the emergency ward is open, but banks must look after their own long-term financing needs. King thinks there are two sources of capital: \"Private savers, or taxpayers via the government.\"</p> <p>Yes, the taxpayer, who has almost been forgotten in the debate about whether the government should intervene in the mortgage market. King was reminding us that someone always has to pay for these schemes and, if the state gets into the business of underwriting mortgages, the taxpayer is on the hook.</p> <p>Is the state really the best body to assess credit risk? Would it not be better if commercial lenders took responsibility for their own decisions? How could private lenders compete with a state-backed lender? Wouldn't banks' efforts to rebuild their capital cushions be undermined? Wouldn't financial stability be weakened as a result? King left these questions hanging in the air at yesterday's select committee meeting; but they are excellent questions.</p> <p>The instinct to do something to help the mortgage market is understandable. A huge hole in funding has appeared. In 2007, the wholesale money markets provided \u00a3275bn of capital, largely through securitisation. In the last 12 months, there hasn't been a significant securitisation. But that figure - \u00a3275bn - should give pause for thought. If the taxpayer is going to make a difference in a market of that size, we are entering very deep waters.</p> <p>The alternative is to do nothing; allow house prices to find their natural level and let banks rebuild without handing them a blank cheque. That policy is not without risks. House prices could overshoot; the damage to other parts of the economy could increase; and the fallout from the chaos in the US banking system could intensify. But the risks outlined by King yesterday are also real: the law of unintended consequences runs through state intervention in the mortgage market. On balance, doing nothing is the right thing to do.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Greetings, y'all, from the good ol', downhome, hockey mom-loving US of A! Truly, no expense is spared on this page when it comes to inveigling ourselves into the celebrity world. And seeing as there are only so many times a lady can put up with getting baked beans chucked at her head by Hugh Grant, Lost in Showbiz has followed the Pet Shop Boys' instructions and gone west. No applause, please, just money, sent via Lost in Showbiz's accountant, Henry Conway.</p> <p>Great cultural happenings are afoot here. Last week, my fellow lipstick-wearing pitbull Laura Barton wrote about the return of the 90s, citing the resurrection of such classics as Beverly Hills, 90210 (but this time without the Peach Pit, which is pretty much like *NSync without Lance Bass) and New Kids on the Block (once upon a time, readers under 30, the name \"Jordan\" had very different connotations). Lost in Showbiz would like to chuck another log into this fire: courtroom shots of OJ! Absolutely one of that decade's cultural highlights.</p> <p>Admittedly, this time the Juiceman is not up for double murder - only robbery, assault and kidnapping - but already his resurrection has thrown up some golden nuggets. Number one has got to be the previously unseen interview OJ gave in 2002 advising us that the club scene in Florida, where Simpson lives, would have to do without him because he was always getting hassled. No, not by people shouting \"Murderer! Wife killer! Rot in hell, you bloated devil man!\" Heavens, no. But by drug dealers who just wouldn't stop giving away free samples. \"You can't go to the bathroom in clubs without somebody saying, 'Juice, you want a hit?' You always get people handing you something.\" Lost in Showbiz would like everyone to note the adorable distancing effect Simpson achieves with the use of the second-person pronoun. So sweet how he includes us all. \"It might be a line of coke with a phone number. [So] you take it, put it in your pocket, drive home. Next day, I wake up and look over next to my bed. I had two things I assume to be pills, a couple of things I assume to be cocaine and one little package of pot.\" Yes, the little cherub can only assume.</p> <p>But inability to share his own unique brand of loving with the lucky ladies of South Beach is small potatoes compared with OJ's problem this week: how to find a juror who doesn't think the Juiceman got away with the '94 murders of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman? One pesky prospective juror this week shouted as much to OJ's face during jury selection, which is one damn clever way to get out of jury duty.</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz would humbly like to make its own suggestion: Leslie Nielsen, the Zeppo to OJ's Harpo. Who can forget that seminal moment in Naked Gun 2\u00bd when Nielsen inadvertently drags Simpson under his car, where he gets hit in the nuts repeatedly? As Mastercard would say, priceless. Should Leslie be too busy, how about Dancing with the Stars' Priscilla Presley? That immobile face certainly doesn't seem to register any belief, pre-formed or otherwise. Then add in some other reality-TV regulars: Sharon Osbourne, of course, for some tough but nurturing talk; Piers Morgan for his tact and discretion; Randy Jackson for his knowledge of complex family dynamics. But of course, the kicker would have to be Kim Kardashian, sitting in for her late father, who was Simpson's lawyer back in '94. OMFG, how, like, totally touching! Kim, for the uninitiated, found her own fame in the true American way - via a web-circulated sex tape - before appearing in a reality-TV show about her family, and was spotted this week at the launch of the pink BlackBerry, where she announced that \"There is literally nothing better than the pink BlackBerry.\" Mind, steel trap, etc. Anyway, she would give the whole thing a kind of reality-TV kick that even her father and the leader of OJ's defence team, Johnnie Cochran, never quite managed the first time round. Let's call it, OJ: Did He Do It? You Decide!</p>",
  "<p>Barry Robson, the Scotland midfielder, believes George Burley unintentionally contributed to the pressure he found himself under this week by opening his managerial reign against leading opposition.</p> <p>The heat cooled in Iceland on Wednesday, when Burley recorded his first victory, having risen intensely following the weekend reverse in Macedonia.</p> <p>Defeat in Skopje had left Burley presiding over a run of four international fixtures without success, adding to the criticism of his reign prior to Reykjavik. But Robson, Scotland's most impressive midfielder in both World Cup qualifying games, believes Burley deserves credit for staging his first two friendlies as manager against Croatia and the Czech Republic, ranked fifth and eighth in the world respectively, with the development of the team prioritised above results.</p> <p>\"The manager deliberately took on tough games against the likes of Croatia and the Czech Republic and people tend to forget the quality of opposition he took on,\" the Celtic midfielder said. \"I can't understand why people wanted to be negative about the results. We know that we have to qualify for the World Cup. Everyone is in this together. We're here for Scotland and we all want the same thing.\"</p> <p>The victory over Iceland has afforded the manager valuable breathing space until the home game with Norway next month, and Burley's lot has also been improved by Lee McCulloch distancing himself from claims he retired from international football because of the man in charge.</p> <p>The Rangers midfielder feels he has become the most hated man in Scotland for ending his international career for personal reasons, with the timing of the announcement - in the aftermath of the Macedonia defeat - largely to blame. The 30-year-old, however, has now revealed he had been considering retirement since defeat to Italy cost Scotland a place at Euro 2008 last November.</p> <p>\"The timing was not too good, when the boys were trying to get themselves ready for a game,\" admitted McCulloch. \"I had spoken to the SFA before the game and let them know that decision and I was hoping it was going to be quiet in the background between me, the manager and [the team administrator] Richard Simpson. I think as we speak just now, the whole nation hate me. I just wanted to let everyone know the truth.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Tour of Britain has in the past proved a launchpad for young talent and the new star unearthed by this year's edition appears to be Edvald Boasson Hagen, the 21-year-old Norwegian who yesterday celebrated a second consecutive stage win at a windswept Dalby Forest. </p> <p>The wind, and a sequence of steep climbs in the closing miles, meant a tough day for everyone though Boasson Hagen made light of the challenges, ordering his Columbia team to chase down a three-man break 30 miles into the stage, then effortlessly jumping across to the trio in the company of former Tour de France yellow jersey Victor Hugo Pe\u00f1a when the gap came down to 12 seconds. </p> <p>The five remained clear for the remaining 70 miles and Boasson Hagen's coup de gr\u00e2ce was even more impressive. It came 800 metres from the line when, after chasing down a late surge by the ever-aggressive Danilo Di Luca, he attacked the group to win alone, four seconds in front of Matt Goss and a dejected Di Luca.</p> <p>Behind the breakaway, the Agritubel team of race leader Geoffrey Lequarte endured a difficult day. \"It was really hard,\" said Lequarte, \"there were a lot of attacks and it was difficult to control. We had to check all the numbers to see if any were dangerous but when the break went, we knew we could let them go. </p> <p>\"I am a little tired but my team did good work and I hope we can do it again tomorrow,\" said Lequarte, who singled out Romain Feillu - last year's winner, who wore yellow in this year's Tour de France - and Emilien Berg\u00e9s, whose stint in yellow in the race was ended by a puncture on Wednesday. </p> <p>Behind Lequarte there was no change, with three British riders in the top five including Steve Cummings, second with a deficit of six seconds. If Lequarte is as tired as he appeared last night, and his team is put under as much pressure as yesterday, Cummings could become the first home rider to win the national tour since Robert Millar in 1989. Coincidentally, tomorrow, when the race starts in Millar's native Glasgow, is the Scotsman's 50th birthday.</p> <p>The most relieved of the British riders yesterday was Ian Stannard, who held on to fourth but only after a desperate chase. He was dropped from a diminishing peloton on the first of three climbs and only regained contact in the final kilometre, with Tom Southam, who in Stannard's words \"buried himself\" to help his GB team-mate, patting him on the back as they crossed the line. </p> <p>\"We took some risks on the descents and had to chase for ages,\" said Stannard, \"I was a bit ill last night with a stomach bug, so it was a really hard day.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama yesterday made a belated personal appeal to Bill Clinton for advice on how to fight back against a resurgent Republican presidential campaign. The lunchtime meeting in New York between the Democratic party's two towering figures came amid growing despair at Obama's slide in the polls in the past week. Democratic figures are openly expressing fears that he does not have a strategy to counter the rising appeal of John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin. </p> <p>Although Clinton extravagantly praised Obama in his speech to the Democratic convention in Denver last month, the relationship between the two has remained strained after Obama's bitter Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton earlier this year. Yesterday's meeting, which took place at the headquarters of Clinton's foundation in Harlem, was their first face-to-face encounter since the primary season ended in June. They had spoken on the phone on only two occasions since Obama won the nomination.</p> <p>In an attempt to smooth the way for the meeting, Obama said he saw parallels between his own campaign and Clinton's in 1992: a relatively unknown politician fighting the Republicans against a backdrop of an ailing economy.</p> <p>\"I've got lunch with Bill Clinton, which I'm looking forward to,\" he told David Letterman on Wednesday night. \"There's nobody smarter in politics and he is going to be campaigning for us over the next eight weeks, which I'm thrilled by, because the race that he ran in 92 was similar to what's taking place now.\"</p> <p>Clinton extended the lunch offer to Obama about a week ago - before Palin began to energise the Republican base - after waiting for months for the Democratic candidate to get in touch. If they had met earlier it would have been characterised as Obama meeting Clinton from a position of strength, but it now adds to the sense of Obama being on the defensive and needing help in putting his campaign back on course.</p> <p>Obama said Clinton had been successful in reaching out to people in 1992 on the economy and he would like to use him in that role in this campaign, telling people \"why we need to change the economy in a fundamental way so it works for middle-class families, so that they can get ahead, so that they can send their kids to college. I think he can be a great advocate on behalf of the campaign,\" he said.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has been actively campaigning for Obama in battleground states. However, she has drawn a line against making personal attacks on Palin, Clinton insiders said. She is happy to attack the Republicans on policy, but thinks it is a strategic mistake to engage in personal criticism of Palin. But she defended Obama who has been under attack for using the phrase \"lipstick on a pig\" to describe McCain's recycled policies. Republicans have accused him of insulting Palin. </p> <p>Clinton dismissed the notion at a press conference yesterday. \"Barack has made this clear,\" she said. \"It was in no way meant as an affront.\" </p> <p>While Bill Clinton will also go out on the trail for Obama, the election timetable is narrowing. The former president has many commitments in the next few weeks, including his annual Global Initiative conference in New York this month, which attracts leaders from the world to discuss climate change and development.</p> <p>A new opinion poll out yesterday showed Obama's poll lead slipping in key states that will determine the election outcome: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. A Quinnipiac University poll showed McCain pulling away in Florida, with a lead of 50% to Obama's 43%. The Republican was narrowing the gap in Pennsylvania, with Obama on 48% and McCain on 45%. Obama maintained his lead in Ohio, 49% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>There were signs this week of a concerted effort by Obama's campaign to fight back against Republican attacks. A close adviser, Valerie Jarrett, told the Wall Street Journal yesterday that Obama had told her he was not going to let Palin hijack media attention any longer. Echoing the view reached by Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats, Obama said he would desist from personal attacks on Palin and \"stay focused on John McCain\".</p> <p>Obama's bad week became worse when the National Rifle Association stepped up opposition to him. The NRA, which has millions of US supporters and had played little part in the campaign, sees Obama as hostile towards gun ownership.</p>",
  "<p>Emiliana Torrini has always been something of a stylistic magpie, but knowing that is no preparation for the kaleidoscope of sounds on her third album. The title track is a scatty little attempt at dub that proves strangely affecting, while Gun draws on dirty psych-garage to conjure up a sordidly seductive mood. Big Jumps, in which Torrini echoes the \"doo, do-doo\" chorus of Lou Reed's backup girls walking on the wild side, is exhilarating, twisty sort-of folk. These songs give the impression that Torrini is having oodles of fun - which couldn't be said of the album's rather earnest predecessor, 2005's Fisherman's Woman. Unfortunately, a chunk of Me and Armini revives that gentle acoustic mood: these tracks are beautiful in their way, mournful and gossamer-light, but insipid compared with the album's more inspired moments. </p>",
  "<p>JC Decaux confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp about merging with News Corp's Russian-based outdoor advertising arm. The deal, which analysts reckon could be worth up to $1bn (\u00a3570m), would see JC Decaux, based in Paris, leapfrog its American rival Clear Channel Communications to become the world's largest outdoor advertising specialist.</p> <p>News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch has grown increasingly uneasy about the News Outdoor Group business, which employs 4,500 people across eastern Europe, Russia and Asia. </p> <p>Last year News Corp admitted it was looking at a sale of the business and last month Murdoch made it plain in a conference call with Wall Street analysts that he was falling out of love with doing business in Russia. He stressed the Russian-based business was growing, but added: \"I'm sorry, the more I read about investments in Russia, the less I like the feel of it.\"</p> <p>Just last week News Outdoors' Moscow HQ was raided by investigators from the prosecutor general's office as part of a criminal investigation into the first deputy chairman of the Moscow committee for advertising and information. In June, News Outdoor Russia was accused of receiving illegal discounts on billboard advertising in Moscow from the committee from 2002 to 2007. Moscow's city government sought more than 200m roubles (\u00a34.4m) in damages, but its claim was rejected in court.</p> <p>The company said last week's search was carried out as part of the inquiry into the official, not the company, adding: \"There is no case of any kind initiated against News Outdoor that would be the reason for the inspection.\"</p> <p>Several foreign firms have found themselves the target of heavy-handed harassment at the hands of Russian regulators and officials - usually interpreted as attempts by the Kremlin to crack down on non-Russian businesses. </p> <p>This week British American Tobacco was targeted with threats of legal action by Russia's consumer rights agency, Rospotrebnadzor. Its director, Gennady Onishchenko, said he had signed a lawsuit against BAT for \"misleading\" consumers and infringing their rights. He would not give details.</p> <p>Last week, BP agreed to make wholesale changes to the management structure of its troubled TNK-BP joint venture to appease its four Russian billionaire partners. </p> <p>The changes included the removal of its chief executive, Robert Dudley, who left the country in July after what he claimed was a sustained campaign of harassment.</p> <p>Its rival, Shell, meanwhile, eventually handed a large share of its Sakhalin gasfield business to the state-owned Gazprom after destabilising criticism from regulators.</p> <p>JC Decaux said yesterday that it was in exclusive talks with News Corp about the business, and any deal would involve a mix of cash and shares and result in \"a combination\" of JC Decaux and News Outdoor.</p> <p>The News Corp subsidiary has operations in Russia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Israel, Poland, Romania and Ukraine; in south-east Asia it has businesses in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.</p> <p>News Outdoor added that, \"as a result of the deal, JC Decaux will gain a control stake in News Outdoor Group and will become the world's number one outdoor advertising operator while News Corp will become a shareholder in JC Decaux\".</p>",
  "<p>Robert Mugabe expended a lot of energy on denouncing the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangirai, as nothing more than a \"British puppet\" who only wanted to return the land to white farmers. The only leader the country has known in its 28 years of independence said he would rather go back to the bush and fight another liberation war than hand over Zimbabwe to Tsvangirai. </p> <p>But yesterday, Mugabe was apparently persuaded to face reality under the unrelenting pressure of economic collapse and a desperate and hungry population, agreeing to cede most of his powers to Tsvangirai.</p> <p>The MDC leader's refusal to buckle and recognise Mugabe's flawed claim to power under pressure from some African leaders, and the continued assault on his party's MPs and activists, had meant there was no prospect of Zimbabwe getting the foreign aid it needs to rebuild the economy.</p> <p>Mugabe had retained power through a bloody campaign against the voters, overturning Tsvangirai's victory in the first round of the presidential election in March and claiming 90% of the vote in a second round three months later. But it did not confer legitimacy on Mugabe's claim to be president and he had no solutions to the deepening crisis, as inflation surged to about 20m percent.</p> <p>Tsvangirai will now become prime minister at the head of a council of ministers. There are likely to be more than 30 of them, which could prove unwieldy. But the council will be the principal organ of government, while Mugabe chairs a less powerful cabinet. </p> <p>The council of ministers is to be divided between the MDC and Zanu-PF, and the division of the portfolios has yet to be agreed, which has the potential for further disagreement.</p> <p>Mugabe wants Zanu-PF to keep control of the military through the defence ministry. The MDC can live with that, provided it has authority over the police, which will prove crucial in ensuring the fairness of future elections. But it is unclear if Zanu-PF will agree.</p> <p>There may also be fundamental disagreement over land policy and the future of the formerly white-owned farms whose seizure helped to bring down the economy.</p> <p>The opposition remained cautious last night, saying it believed Mugabe could yet back away before the signing of the agreement on Monday.</p> <p>There is also concern among some of Mugabe's critics who say he is skilled at outmanoeuvring his opponents and could still wield considerable influence. </p> <p>Nonetheless, one MDC official said that it was not in Tsvangirai's interests to reach an agreement that did not give him real power, because if he was unable to dramatically improve the lives of Zimbabweans he would be finished.</p> <p>Foreign donors, including Britain and the US, said there would be no aid if Mugabe retained power - a trump card in Tsvangirai's negotiations.</p> <p>The price of change has been high. About 4 million Zimbabweans - one quarter of the population - have left the country in recent years in search of work to feed their families. Hundreds have been murdered, thousands beaten and tortured, and tens of thousands driven from their homes in the regime's desperate efforts to cling to power.</p>",
  "<p>The government's vaunted \u00a31bn energy efficiency package was called into question last night when the energy producers said they would have to pass on much of the cost to consumers, and industry sources said fewer than 150,000 extra homes could be insulated by this winter as a result of the new money. </p> <p>Another important plank of the package - a commitment to increase funding for the government's Warm Front programme by an extra \u00a374m over two years - does not restore spending this year to the levels planned before a \u00a355m cut imposed on the programme last year. </p> <p>Brown said he did not expect the electricity companies to pass the prices on to the consumer, adding: \"I do not think they need to do so.\" </p> <p>But David Porter, spokesman for the Association of Electricity Producers, said: \"Whenever people impose costs on an industry like ours, inevitably the bill to some extent always ends up with the customer ... There are competitive pressures, but in the end someone has got to pay for this just as someone has got to pay for the green agenda, which is already costing a lot.\"</p> <p>He described Brown's suggestion that the costs would not be passed on as \"too sweeping\".</p> <p>Unions and Labour MPs said they would continue to press for a windfall tax. One leading rebel, Frank Field, said: \"The government has spent all summer roaring about the package it will produce and now out pops a mouse of a proposal that will probably do very little for many of the poorest pensioners meeting this year's winter fuel bills.\" </p> <p>Announcing the measures at Downing Street, Brown said: \"Our objective is nothing less than a sea-change in energy efficiency and consumption, at the same time as helping the most vulnerable households this winter. This is the right approach - the offer of lasting benefit for pensioners and families.\"</p> <p>The government would introduce legislation requiring an estimated \u00a3910m commitment from energy companies including, for the first time, electricity generating companies to invest in making homes more energy efficient. This is in addition to the existing obligation on companies to spend \u00a32.8bn over the next three years on energy efficiency.</p> <p>The government said the extra funding could help 2m households, with pensioners and those on benefits able to recoup the full cost of insulation, and everyone else able to receive a subsidy for half the cost. Neil Marshall, of the National Insulation Association, said only 150,000 additional households could be helped this winter. </p> <p>Cold weather payments will be increased from \u00a38.50 to \u00a325 a week, but only when the temperature drops below freezing for seven successive days.</p>",
  "<p>Russia only sent troops and tanks to drive Georgian forces out of South Ossetia after President George Bush failed to put pressure on Georgia's president to stop his attacks on the breakaway territory, Vladimir Putin said yesterday. The Russian prime minister told a group of western journalists and experts on Russia that he held two meetings with the US leader during the Beijing Olympics as the crisis began to unfold, but received insufficient assurances from him.</p> <p>\"They [Georgian military forces] launched their attacks at 23:30 [on August 7]. I learned about it the following morning. I spoke to Bush. He said 'No one wants war.' We expected something would happen,\" Putin said, suggesting that he expected the US to rein in its regional ally in Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"I met him again at the stadium. I can't tell you in detail the content of the conversation, but I had the feeling that his administration wouldn't do anything about stopping the conflict,\" Putin said. Russian tanks were then ordered to move on the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>It is the first time that Putin has blamed the US for allowing the crisis to erupt. He was polite about Bush, saying he respected his integrity, but he suggested that the president's advisers had taken the key decisions. \"It's a court which makes a king. Maybe the court thought the king shouldn't intervene,\" he said.</p> <p>In his trademark blunt language, Putin also issued a direct warning to the UK that relations could never be repaired as long as London hosted dissident exiles such as the Chechen independence advocate Akhmed Zakayev. \"Why do you allow Great Britain to be used as a launching pad to fight Russia? If we were to give safe haven to militants of the IRA, with arms in their hands, what would you do? Why can they engage in open anti-Russian activity? That's why it's not possible to build normal relations with Britain,\" he said. </p> <p>Zakayev was given asylum in Britain in 2003, the same year as the Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky. Both were close to the former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, whose murder in London in 2006 sent bilateral relations plunging.</p> <p>Despite his tough language over the South Ossetia conflict, Putin refused to issue threats against the west for supporting Georgia. He accused the US of training the Georgian army before its attack on Tskhinvali last month. \"They sent instructors who helped to mobilise the Georgian forces. Of course we had to respond.\"</p> <p>Throughout yesterday's three-hour meeting, he blamed the west for being stuck in cold war \"anti-Russian phobia\", and the American presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, for \"playing the Russian card\". This was \"only a sign of the candidates' weakness\", he said.</p> <p>Making it clear that any expansion of Nato to Georgia or Ukraine would be unwelcome to Moscow, Putin said it was time to create a security architecture for Europe which reflected the new realities in the continent. </p> <p>Russia had no imperial aims, he said, and should be credited for dismantling the Soviet Union. \"Had it not been for Russia, the Soviet Union wouldn't have been dismantled,\" he said.</p> <p>He took issue with the Bush administration's recent decision to install long-range missiles in Poland, ostensibly as a defence against potential missiles from Iran. Iran had no such missiles, he said, and the US missile system's intentions were clear. If the US deployed any missiles, Russia would target Poland. \"Our targeting will start as soon as the missiles are deployed,\" Putin said. \"We say, please don't try again to instigate an arms race in Europe.\" </p> <p>He criticised the Bush administration for foisting decisions on Europe. The missile decisions \"began with bilateral talks with Poland, and then they started to convince Europe it was in their interest\". He made the same point about Ukraine's government's decision to seek Nato membership. \"Eighty per cent of Ukranians don't want it,\" he said. </p> <p>He denied that he was in overall control of Russian decision-making, insisting that President Dmitry Medvedev was the commander in chief. \"He's modern, with a liberal democratic view of things and an excellent education. I am sorry it was his lot to have to deal with this crisis. He is a decent man. He had to give the order to send troops to these republics [South Ossetia and the other breakaway region of Abkhazia]. He had to recognise these republics, he couldn't do otherwise. These were his decisions.\" </p> <p>Putin made clear that Russia could easily have occupied Georgia and toppled its president, Mikheil Saakashvili. \"Our forces were 15 kilometres [nine miles] from Tbilisi. It would have taken four hours to capture Tbilisi. We didn't have that goal.\"</p>",
  "<p>The spirit of John Major's cones hotline returned to Downing St yesterday as Gordon Brown struggled to prove to sceptical voters that he is astride the country's most pressing concerns. For Major's 1992 cones initiative (quietly dropped in 1995) read Brown's loft insulation. For the Tory hotline read Labour's coldline when the weather gets really nasty. There will be grants, helpful tips, TV adverts, even a booklet which can be burned in colder emergencies. </p> <p>All this and more was announced as part of a \u00a31bn energy package at Brown's monthly press conference yesterday, staged during another of those ferocious Downing St downpours which have become routine this summer. It was pretty wet outside too.</p> <p>\"Welcome back, I hope you had a good summer,\" the boss told the hacks with boilerplate insincerity. \"I managed to get some good weather during my holiday in England.\" (Hint: Cameron went to Turkey).</p> <p>And so it proceeded. In the next hour Brown was invited to attack Sarkozy (\"Isn't he doing well?\" the hacks kept reminding him) or Australia's Kevin Rudd; to sack David Miliband and Alistair Darling; declare war on Iran; or disembowel himself for getting so much wrong since last September. </p> <p>He sidestepped all such offers, though the words \"I do take responsibility\" did pass through gritted teeth. Periodically, like sunshine after rain, a smile would break across his face as if by remote control and for no apparent reason. </p> <p>Nor did he look especially well rested, not really brown at all. That may be the secret of Gordon's ability to take the punishment. Adversity never gets him down: he's down already.</p> <p>Yesterday's energy package was admirable in its way. So was the cones hotline. What both failed to do was match public expectations. As winter engulfs Britain, how much warmer will freezing grannies feel knowing they may get their cavity walls filled for free if they survive until April, the hacks wanted to know.</p> <p>And what about that on-off windfall tax? What about energy bills rising NOW? The government's plans sounded like \"jam tomorrow\" suggested one uppity BBC reporter.</p> <p>The PM told his tormentors - more than once - that he does not expect the energy companies' \u00a3910m contribution to the Warmer Britain Fund to be passed on to customers, though he was mild and vague - King Lear on Prozac - about what he would do if it is. </p> <p>John Hutton was more menacing. The PM appeared at the No 10 podium (\"Save money, Save energy, Save Gordon\" the logo should have read) flanked by Hutton and Hilary Benn.</p> <p>Were they the cabinet prison warders or his hostages? The herbivorous Benn was clearly there to play the soft warder while Hutton, wild-eyed at the very thought of energy profiteering, was Mr Hard. Any proof of that and he'd promised to come down on profiteers \"like a tonne of bricks\". The idea of getting energy monopolists on the rack in a Whitehall basement clearly excites him. For the first time it was possible to imagine that the man to deliver bad news indeed to Gordon might not be Jack Straw, but John Hutton.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 17 2008</strong></p> <p> East Prussia was not absorbed into the Soviet Union as a result of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, as we said in this obituary. It remained part of Germany until 1945, when it was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union.</p> <p> </p> <p>The best work of the American science-fiction author Algis \"AJ\" Budrys, who has died aged 77, often questions the notion of identity. In Who?, first published in 1958, Lucas Martino, an American scientist vital to national security, is maimed by a laboratory accident that allows him to fall into Russian hands. With his body rebuilt and his face permanently hidden by a metal mask, he is returned to the west, where nobody can be sure if he is the same man. </p> <p>In Rogue Moon, published two years later, trips to Earth's satellite require a matter-transporter to create a duplicate of the traveller, who dies time and again as he explores an alien construction, each death allowing the next version of the explorer to journey a little further. In Michaelmas (1977), an alien resurrects an astronaut believed dead and the hero meets an imperfect replica of himself.</p> <p>Given Budrys' background, it is no surprise that identity was an enduring concern. Born in K\u00f6nigsberg, East Prussia, in 1931, he arrived in America with his parents in 1936. His father, Jonas, had been consul-general for Lithuania in K\u00f6nigsberg, which they had fled to escape the Nazis. Their temporary exile became permanent when East Prussia was absorbed into the Soviet Union as part of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939.</p> <p>Budrys attended the University of Miami and Columbia University in New York before briefly joining Gnome Press as an assistant editor in 1952. In November of that year, he made a double debut with two stories, The High Purpose, published in the magazine Astounding, and Walk to the World, in Space Science Fiction. In 1953, a third story appeared in Galaxy, where he spent an unhappy few months as assistant to the influential science-fiction writer and editor Horace Gold. Budrys' first novel, False Night (1954), was savagely abridged by its publisher and his second, Who?, found itself in limbo due to the publisher's financial difficulties, eventually appearing years later. A movie version (1973) starred Elliott Gould and Trevor Howard.</p> <p>His third novel, Man of Earth (1958), was Budrys' least favourite (\"the less said about that book the better\") and in 1957 he returned to editorial work, first on the science-fiction magazine Venture and then with Royal Publications. This was followed in the early 60s by spells at Regency books, an experimental line, and Playboy Press, as well as PR work.</p> <p>During these years his output of fiction was small, although he later noted that, at one time, he was writing a lot of material for \"a hairy-chested men's adventure magazine\". He was a well-respected book reviewer for Galaxy (1965-71) and Fantasy and Science Fiction (1975-93). His reviews and essays were later collected in Benchmarks (1985) and Outposts: Literatures of Milieux (1997). Budrys became a co-ordinating judge for L Ron Hubbard's Writers of the Future contest in the 1980s.</p> <p>Budrys launched Tomorrow magazine for Dean Wesley Smith and, when Smith found himself in financial difficulties after only one issue, began publishing the magazine himself. It ran for 24 issues until 1997, continuing as an online publication until 2000.</p> <p>Although he never received a major award - he turned down the author emeritus award from the Science Fiction Writers of America in 2005 - his small canon of novels and 200 short stories were critically well received for what the influential author and futurologist Charles Platt called their \"depth, humanity, and political sophistication\". Budrys had been in ill health for some years, primarily complications relating to diabetes. He was recently diagnosed with cancer. He is survived by his wife, Edna, and four sons.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Algirdas Jonas Budrys (Algis Budrys), science-fiction writer, born January 9 1931; died June 9 2008</p>",
  "<p><strong>Richard George</strong><br><strong>A member of the action group Plane Stupid, he was one of five protesters charged with trespass in a restricted area, after climbing on to the roof of the Houses of Parliament in February 2008</strong></p> <p>\"It's just a fantastic result. It shows that the public can distinguish between what the government says and what it does on climate change. It's fantastic that 12 people can turn around and say it's all right to do thousands of pounds' worth of damage. And that's because here we have the public hearing directly from scientists, unfiltered by the media or by party politics, and it makes me very optimistic that we can actually turn this around. We're up in court on November 12 with the same defence, but unfortunately we'll be in front of a magistrate, and they're usually more conservative. But we are confident about the strength of our case: the Department of Transport was colluding with BAA over the construction of Heathrow's new runway, and we had tried other avenues for alerting the public and this was the only course left to us. Sadly, this is only a lower court judgment: for it to become precedent it would have to be appealed to a higher court. All the same, it will open up a whole can of worms. If I was E.ON or owned an airport, I'd be very, very worried.\"</p> <p><strong>Andy Green </strong><br><strong>A member of Leave It In The Ground, an anti-coal campaign. Several of his colleagues are currently awaiting trial for aggravated trespass</strong></p> <p>\"Absolutely excellent! Everyone's talking about it - I got about 90 text messages and emails yesterday. We find it particularly interesting in the light of what's happening here, because our action has all been done with exactly the same aim. We occupied an old farmhouse in Derbyshire where British Coal, against the wishes of the local residents, had managed to get permission to dig an open-cast coal mine. We managed to hold on to the site for a couple of months - we had activists in tunnels and the rest of it - but back in August we were finally forced off the site. Three or four activists are now going on trial in December and two more in January: it's before a magistrate at the moment, but we're hoping it will end up in front of a jury. This verdict will make it really interesting: obviously, it can't apply to everyone - you can't just occupy anything you want - but it will make a difference.\"</p> <p><strong>Colm Bryce </strong><br><strong>One of the Raytheon Nine, who were cleared by a Belfast jury earlier this year of criminal damage to an arms manufacturer. They had used a similar defence to the Kingsnorth Six's - that their actions had been in order to prevent a greater evil</strong></p> <p>\"I've been following the Greenpeace case because, obviously, I could see the similarities, and I was just so pleased. I remember when we got our verdict: we were delighted, but also vindicated. The run-up to the trial is such a long, drawn-out process and it's very wearing. But the trial itself made us all feel much prouder of what we'd done. You kind of felt that no matter what verdict we'd got we had done the right thing. And I think that was a lot to do with the defence we had chosen: it felt much better to be standing up there saying, 'Yes, we did it and this is why,' instead of trying to get off on a technicality. We were asking people to judge us on exactly what we had done, and it was great when the jury took our side.\"</p> <p><strong>Andrea Needham</strong><br><strong>A member of the Seeds of Hope Ploughshares, who disarmed a Hawk jet fighter destined for Indonesia. In 1996, she was acquitted of causing \u00a32.4m worth of criminal damage</strong></p> <p>\"We used a slightly different defence to Greenpeace, because we basically said that under criminal law you are entitled to use reasonable force to prevent a crime. But it was similar in the sense that we were putting a much bigger political issue to a jury, explaining the situation in East Timor and hoping they would understand. The action took place in January 1996; we got into a British Aerospace site near Wharton in Lancashire, and there was one particular plane we had been watching because we knew that it was being sold to Indonesia. We hammered on the plane, and were then arrested, and were held in jail for six months because of the extent of the damage we had caused. The judge was known as a hanging judge but it was such a high-profile case that he was really anxious not to give us grounds for appeal, so he allowed us our defence - which I hadn't expected - and we were allowed to talk in court about East Timor, and bring in witnesses such as John Pilger. When the jury decided to acquit us, it was fantastic, quite wonderful. After all, we were facing several years in prison if they had gone the other way. As for the long-term effects of this case, it doesn't form a precedent because it didn't go to the higher courts, but I think it means that people know these things are possible.\"</p> <p><strong>Mel Evans </strong><br><strong>Part of the Climate Camp, she is one of 29 activists charged with obstruction of the railway, after boarding a coal train in June this year</strong></p> <p>\"It just goes to show that when you put the case for what we're trying to do in front of people, instead of in front of a legal system that is designed to shut us out, the case wins through. When you take the arguments to a jury, then they respond in this way because they can see what the reality is. Has it affected how I feel about our trial? Well, yes and no. When we took the action I had made the decision to risk going to prison, but at the same time I think that if the court does decide to give us all two years - which is the sentence for obstruction of a railway - there would be a really massive public outcry. What we did put no one's life at risk.\" </p>",
  "<p>Ian Elliott, Stewart Downing's former agent, last night issued a statement denying that he owes the Middlesbrough winger money and claiming that the allegations which led to his arrest by fraud squad officers last week are false.</p> <p>\"I am shocked by the allegations recently made against me by Stewart Downing,\" said Elliott, who experienced an acrimonious parting from his former client at the beginning of the year and was later arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. \"I have known and worked with Downing since the very start of his career in 2001, and during that time I have built up a close and successful working relationship with him which I believe others have destroyed with these false allegations.\"</p> <p>Before his split with Downing, Elliott's efforts to negotiate the winger a new contract had angered Steve Gibson to the point that the Boro chairman made some cutting public comments about him.

  "<p>Mark Hughes has insisted that Manchester City's takeover by Arab owners has not placed Tal Ben Haim's position at the club in jeopardy. There has been speculation in the Middle East over the Israeli defender's future.</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates does not recognise Israel and Abu Dhabi's ruling Al Nahyan family, who should secure a 90% stake in City over the next week, were responsible for setting up the Zayed Centre for Coordination and Follow-Up, which was accused of sanctioning the publication of antisemitic material and hosting antisemitic speakers before the UAE government closed it down in 2003.</p> <p>According to the Anti-Defamation League, a pro-Israel pressure group, speakers described Jewish people as \"enemies of all nations\" and \"cheaters whose greed knows no bounds\". That is unlikely to sit easily with the strong Jewish element of City's support.</p> <p>The issue has not been addressed by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, City's owner-in-waiting, or Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim, the billionaire businessman who initially acted as the Abu Dhabi United Group's spokesman. Hughes, however, has said he expects total control of \"football decisions\". Asked if Ben Haim's position could be in doubt, he said: \"It is not something that has been highlighted to me. I understand [the question] but I wouldn't expect that to be case.\" Despite that, the central defender will not be allowed into Abu Dhabi if the club's owners want their new team to take part in a promotional match or tour. A mid-season training camp has already been mooted.</p> <p>Petr Cech has said Chelsea are determined to show Robinho he made a mistake in joining City ahead of the Blues when the two sides meet tomorrow. \"In the morning he says he loves Chelsea and he wants to be part of Chelsea and a few hours later he signs for another club,\" he said. \"He needs to play well for City and we want to show him on Saturday he made a decision that is not perfect for him really. He's a great player so for the league maybe he is good but we will see how he's going to cope with the pressure now.\"</p>",
  "<p>The international peacekeeping force in Darfur, created more than a year ago, is still struggling to do its job protecting civilians because of a lack of equipment, rough terrain and bureaucracy, the force commander said yesterday.</p> <p>General Martin Luther Agwai, who leads the joint UN and African Union peacekeeping mission, Unamid, portrayed it as hamstrung by logistical problems. </p> <p>Unamid came into being in July last year as the result of a security council resolution sponsored by Gordon Brown and French president Nicolas Sarkozy. The aim was to stop the bloodshed in Darfur, in which more than 200,000 people have died, according to UN estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. </p> <p>Unamid formally took over peacekeeping responsibilities at the beginning of this year, but only 10,000 of the agreed 26,000 troops and police have so far arrived in Sudan. The target had been to achieve 80% troop strength by the end of the year, but Agwai said that was now unlikely. There is also no sign of the 24 helicopters the force needs to do its job.</p> <p>\"I was never part of the drawing of the mandate or the planning of the operation. But at least there was a minimum they thought the mission required,\" the general said during a visit to London. \"This is the basic minimum that we need and now we are very far away from it. No country has come up to offer helicopters to us.\"</p> <p>Even the troops that have arrived have not been able to operate properly because in many cases, Agwai said, their equipment was stuck in logistical bases with no means of getting across the roadless, parched terrain of Darfur. </p> <p>\"Most people expect us to carry out the primary role of our mandate - protection of civilians, helping the humanitarian agencies. But right now that is not our priority, because for us to be able to do that we need the troops, we need the equipment ... so we are struggling,\" the Nigerian general said. \"Now we have even turned some of our own personnel into drivers to bring in the equipment.\"</p> <p>Agwai gave the example of an Egyptian battalion that has been ready to deploy for months, but whose equipment has been stuck in a base outside the conflict area since March. Lacking adequate transport, Unamid had contracted a Sudanese haulage firm to do the job, but it had no experience in moving heavy military machinery along the rough tracks of Darfur and some had been damaged. Repair teams had to be sent out from Egypt. </p> <p>Unamid's deployment was slowed initially by the Sudanese government, which objected to the deployment of non-African troops. But now the principal bottleneck is logistical, Agwai said. Eighteen battalions had been pledged, but the force's capacity to absorb them and deploy them in areas where they were needed to guard relief camps against warring factions and bandits was severely limited. </p> <p>Agwai said a natural alternative to road transport would be an airlift, but helicopters and aircraft had not been forthcoming from donor nations.</p> <p>The few helicopters at the UN's disposal are operated by civilian contractors, and their use is subject to contractual clauses and insurance requirements. They are not under Agwai's direct control and cannot be flown into a conflict zone. Unamid lost eight men in an ambush in July, and Agwai said the casualties might well have been avoided if it had had helicopters.</p>",
  "<p>Israeli police searching a river yesterday pulled out a red suitcase containing a child's skull and bones, which they believe are the remains of a small girl missing for four months.</p> <p>The disappearance of four-year-old Rose Pizem has gripped Israelis for weeks. The girl's mother, Marie-Charlotte Renault, 23, and paternal grandfather, Ronny Ron, 45, who were in a relationship with each other, are being held on suspicion of involvement in the murder. Ron admitted killing Rose and then later took back his confession, police said.</p> <p>\"We found the girl's body but it needs to undergo tests so we can be completely sure it's her,\" police commissioner David Cohen said at the scene. Police divers have spent several days searching through the Yarkon river after Ron told them he had dumped her body in a suitcase in the water. A postmortem examination was under way yesterday.</p> <p>Rose was born in Paris in 2004, when Renault and her new husband, Benjamin Pizem, were still teenagers. After a year the couple travelled to Israel to meet Pizem's father, Ron, whom he had never met. Later Renault said she had fallen in love with Ron and stayed in Israel. Pizem returned to France with Rose.</p> <p>Renault and her father-in-law had two more children. In December they won custody of Rose, who came to live with them. She was reportedly suffering several emotional and developmental problems and it appears the couple were unable to cope with the child.</p>",
  "<p>Returning this week from covering the American conventions, I was struck above all by one thing concerning Labour's political mood: the party's sheer pessimism, its fatalism, its defeatism, its sense that no matter what anyone does the game is up and nothing can be done to change it. </p> <p>This sense of failure is not confined to the way Labour politicians think about Britain. It seems to infect the way many think about the rest of the world. Intellectual pessimism has long been one of the distinguishing features of British conservatism. Now it is part of the progressive mindset too. For Labour the whole world is framed by its own present sense of failure. It is as though, if they are doomed to defeat themselves, then they are going to make damn sure everyone else is doomed.</p> <p>Attitudes over here to the American election are the most striking example of this reflexive pessimism. I have found myself in Labour and even Liberal Democrat circles several times this week, and they all say exactly the same: Obama has blown it. Sarah Palin has turned the election. McCain is going to win. Hillary would have been better.</p> <p>To each bit of that I say, phooey. This election isn't settled yet. There is an eight-week battle ahead and anything can happen. Certainly McCain could win. Two weeks ago on these pages I set out five reasons - the eclipse of George Bush, Republican campaign skills, uncertain times, Obama fatigue, and race - why he might. But there are at least five real, potent, living reasons why Obama can pull this one out: time for a change, the Republican record, fear of McCain-Palin, improved Democratic campaigning, and solid promises for working-class voters (not counting the inspirational candidate, getting beyond the Clintons, and more.)</p> <p>Those assets have not all disappeared at the first whiff of political grapeshot. The changing demographics that are slowly but remorselessly pushing America towards the Democrats have not gone into reverse just because Palin appeared from nowhere at the end of August. The deep, consistent opinion poll finding that Americans think their country is heading in the wrong direction hasn't suddenly done an about-turn. Obama still speaks for new political forces, and the registration of new pro-Obama voters has not dissolved into a political black hole. American women have not turned overnight into tribal airheads who will mindlessly vote for anyone in a skirt.</p> <p>But nor has America in 2008 been wholly transformed from the nation that elected Bush in 2000 and 2004. Whatever the matter was with America in Thomas Frank's bestselling 2004 book on conservative populism is still pretty much the matter four years later. If America in 2004 was, in the resonant title of John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's outstanding book of that year, the \"right nation\" - right because it is morally driven and also because it is rightwing - then it has not undergone an identity transplant in the brief period since. Unless and until you understand that white men in America simply tend to vote more conservative than men in other industrialised countries, you just don't get much about America.</p> <p>British progressive politicians are fascinated by American politics, but not many of them get this, or much else about it either. America's foreignness - on which the BBC's Justin Webb has just penned a book of his own - consistently escapes them. Too often they jet in wanting to see only similarities, and to focus on the things about America that reinforce their instincts about Britain. They seem only to see the form of politics - the campaign, the soundbites, the presentational issues, the ways of doing things - not the content, the causes and the conflicts that make American politics so distinct and different from ours, this election in particular.</p> <p>Tony Blair and Gordon Brown took the embrace of America a stage further. As soon as they encountered it in 1992, they identified overwhelmingly with Bill Clinton's moderate, centrist Democratic cause because it seemed to confirm and illuminate their view of how Labour should behave - moving to the middle ground, triangulating the difficult issues in the party battle, modernising the campaigning. Blair believed that Clinton's victories were essential preconditions of his own. If the Democrats won, Labour could present themselves as a party on the side of history. Brown's instinct is similar, as his bungled public embrace of Obama this week showed.</p> <p>Yet the Labour high command, past and present, is privately conflicted about Obama. They want a Democrat to win in November, but they do not really want it to be Obama. Labour resents Hillary Clinton's defeat this year almost as much as the Clintons do. They looked at Clinton and saw someone they recognised. They thought, somewhat naively, that she was the safe and therefore the better choice. That is why there is a kind of schadenfreude in Labour circles about the way the campaign has gone in the past two weeks. It is as though Labour people almost want the Democrats to lose this year, because in some twisted way that outcome would validate their own failure. At one level a lot of them feel very threatened by Obama and his success. </p> <p>This is because Labour politicians have become prisoners of themselves. Roy Jenkins's analogy of Blair's attitude to electoral success - as that of a man carrying an irreplaceable Ming vase across a polished and slippery museum floor - still goes straight to the point. Both Blair and Brown (Brown in particular) have always been haunted by the fear that their success could suddenly go irreversibly wrong. It is why they are such frightened control freaks. They worry that Britain is, at heart, a Tory-voting nation that must be appeased not challenged. And so, having feared the backlash so much, they have now helped to make it happen and seem powerless to do anything about it.</p> <p>But these are mind-forged manacles. They were needed in their time but that time is no longer now. This is as true in the very different political arena of the United States as it is in ours. In the end, in spite of the risks, the great thing about Obama is that he is the post-Clinton candidate that the Democrats need. He offers a different political temper for different political times. He embodies hope and change and still, perhaps, victory. Brown offers none of these. Obama's lesson is staring Labour in the face - but Labour seems simply too demoralised now to learn it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The first thing you notice when you fly into Britain from abroad is how dinky it all looks from the air - miles of tiny houses side by side and thousands of little cars squeezing along narrow, winding roads. It is enough to lower the spirits even before you have landed. The effect is most striking when you have flown from America, which is like travelling from Brobdingnag to Lilliput; but the contrast exists if you fly in from almost anywhere. For Britain has some of the smallest houses of any country in western Europe and continues to build them on a minuscule scale.</p> <p>Britain's \"rabbit hutch\" culture is a masochistic theme of the British pavilion at the Architecture Biennale that opened in Venice yesterday. \"The cause is simple and shocking,\" said its curator, Ellis Woodman. \"England and Wales are the only parts of Europe where house-building is unregulated by legally binding minimum space standards.\" So we go on building mingy little homes in which there isn't room to swing a cat, and we can't replace old houses with bigger ones because we must keep to the existing \"footprint\". Even little, overcrowded countries such as Belgium and Holland allow people on average about 40 more square metres of living space in new housing than Britain does. It is not surprising that a survey by the housing charity Shelter has found that 86% of families living in cramped conditions report cases of depression or anxiety in their midst. Why do you think we spend so much time in the streets getting drunk and stabbing each other?</p> <p>With the government aiming to build three million new homes by 2020, it is obviously cheaper to keep them small. But it is a very bad idea all the same, since we suffer from enough claustrophobia already. This isn't only because of the pokiness of our homes; we are also burdened in our everyday lives with restrictions and snooping of every kind. The zeal shown by councils in enforcing their complicated rules about rubbish disposal, including the use of child informers to catch \"bin criminals\", is particularly oppressive. A woman in Manchester was fined \u00a3700 this week for putting out her rubbish on the wrong day - an offence known as \"the advancement of waste\". Her reason? To make more room in her backyard for her four-year-old daughter to play in.</p> <p>Another good reason for building bigger houses is to reduce class divisions, as Harriet Harman is so keen to do. America may have great inequalities of wealth, but the difference in scale between the homes of the rich and the poor is generally much less than here; one of the reasons why it feels more classless.</p> <p><strong>The pompous outrage of the authorities over the </strong>police chief who wore an Osama bin Laden mask at a charity event in Cornwall almost beggars belief. Is there nothing else the IPCC could usefully investigate? But one shouldn't really be surprised by this when people nowadays are obsessed with exposing examples of \"inappropriate\" or \"offensive\" behaviour by others. It is a habit that threatens to kill any spontaneous form of self-expression.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more depressingly evident than in the American election campaign where the hunt for the \"gaffe\" dominates proceedings at the expense of any kind of serious debate about who would be the best person to be president of the United States. Talk of \"pigs\" and \"lipstick\", taken out of context, and even Joe Biden's modest aside that Hillary Clinton might have been a better pick than him as a vice-presidential candidate, become major issues on which the fate of the nation hangs. </p> <p>Nobody knows much about Sarah Palin except that she is able to wow the women of America and the hardcore Republican right. But in vain does the New York Times plead for a serious examination of her qualities and her suitability for high office. Instead, her critics hardly dare ask even pertinent questions of her lest they be accused of sexism, elitism, or some other ignoble form of prejudice, for they know that they risk offending her at their peril. But there was a time when people didn't give a fig for the feelings of pitbulls, even female ones, as Margaret Thatcher discovered. </p> <p><strong>I was suffused with nostalgia at Tuesday's </strong>promenade concert at the Royal Albert Hall, for Murray Perahia and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra were playing the same Mozart piano concerto, No. 24 in C Minor, that I played more than 50 years ago as a boy at Eton. My performance took place in the drawing room of the then headmaster, the late Robert Birley, with an orchestra of fellow schoolboys supplemented by a professional French horn player from one of the London orchestras (making a gurgling sound because he feared shaking out the spittle from his instrument on to the headmaster's carpet). Although I wasn't very good at the piano, and didn't even play the last movement because it was too difficult for me, I was accorded the honour because I was then considered the best pianist in the school, being there at an especially unmusical time in its history. </p> <p>It was the proudest moment of my life, and hearing Perahia's magnificent rendering of this glorious piece, I could hardly believe I had ever been capable of playing it, however inadequately. I certainly couldn't even begin to play it today.</p> <p><strong>This week Alexander</strong> has been reading The House of Wittgenstein: A Family at War by his son-in-law, Alexander Waugh: \"A gripping account of how too much money can tear apart even the most gifted and, in many respects, most fortunate of families.\"</p>",
  "<p>The World Bank has quietly cancelled a \"model\" oil pipeline agreement with Chad after revenues meant to be spent on schools and hospitals were used to consolidate President Idriss D\u00e9by's grip on power.</p> <p>The innovative deal, signed in 2000, was supposed to ensure that the oil wealth in one of the world's poorest and most corrupt countries was not wasted. But this week the World Bank confirmed that it had pulled out of the project it had helped finance, after Chad agreed to repay a $140m (\u00a380m) loan ahead of schedule. </p> <p>In a statement, the World Bank said that D\u00e9by's government had failed to \"allocate adequate resources critical for poverty reduction\" as set out in the original agreement. </p> <p>\"Regrettably, it became evident that the arrangements that had underpinned the bank's involvement in the Chad/Cameroon pipeline project were not working. The bank therefore concluded that it could not continue to support this project under these circumstances,\" it said.</p> <p>The decision is deeply embarrassing for the World Bank. It had hoped that the experiment could serve as an example for other developing countries on how to ensure transparency and avoid the \"resource curse\", where the profits from a country's natural wealth are pocketed by the ruling elite. </p> <p>Despite warnings from civil society groups that D\u00e9by's regime was incapable of effectively managing a sudden inflow of petrodollars, the World Bank agreed to part-finance the construction of a 620-mile, $4.2bn pipeline linking landlocked Chad to terminals on Cameroon's Atlantic coast. Its support added crucial credibility to what was at the time the largest ever private sector investment in sub-Saharan Africa - in one of the continent's most unstable countries. </p> <p>In return for the World Bank's blessing, Chad's government agreed to spend 72% of oil royalties, expected to reach $1.4bn this year, on building schools, hospitals and roads. A further 10% was to have been held back for future generations. The safeguards were considered crucial given that reserves are only expected to last 30 years; the oil bonanza is Chad's one chance at rapid development. </p> <p>But although an independent oversight commission was set up to monitor spending, it was prevented from properly doing its work once the oil began to flow in 2003. The anti-poverty spending targets never came close to being met. </p> <p>D\u00e9by repeatedly tried to renegotiate to allow the government to spend more oil money as it pleased. He won some concessions from the World Bank in 2006, and then sought to deflect domestic criticism of the lack of development by arguing that outsiders \"had imposed injustice on us\". Describing the government's share of the revenue from the 170,000 barrels a day as \"crumbs\", he temporarily expelled US company Chevron and Petronas, the Malaysian state-owned firm, which together with Exxon Mobil run most of the oil operations in Chad. </p> <p>Over the past year, as D\u00e9by's own future has looked increasingly insecure with rebels attacking the capital, he has signed decrees giving him greater personal control over the country's finances. A significant chunk of the oil revenue is believed to have been spent on the military.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 17 2008</strong></p> <p> It wasn't a customs official at Gatwick airport who stole the baby's dinner as we said in this headline. It was someone from airport security.</p> <p> </p> <p>I know a column is the wrong place to prosecute an administrative grudge, but I have to do it somewhere and I will at least do you the favour of admitting it's a grudge and not trying to weave it into a pretend theme.</p> <p>C, T and I were going to Italy. Everyone is always on about how much the continentals love children, but really that is because they have just been through British bureaucracy, specifically at Gatwick airport, where a person attempting to travel with a child is treated as if they're trying to slip a leprous pigeon into a hitherto uncontaminated nation.</p> <p>\"Are you a housewife, madam?\" said the official, with a smile that was more like the ritualistic teeth-baring of early man, and I think maybe things would have gone better for me if I'd said \"Yes\" or \"No\", instead of \"What kind of a question is that?\" But of course at this point I hadn't considered the full reach of her powers, nor for that matter her raw evil. So first she confiscates T's nappy rash cream, because it's 150 ml instead of 100. Oh. The next day was a Sunday. His poor, sore holiday arse. I thought maybe she was joking, but something told me not to cheek her, in case she really ran riot and tried to confiscate my blood, or one of my eyeballs. Nope, she was not joking. </p> <p>It was so unkind I felt a little bit queasy, which didn't make this next part any easier: I had four little containers of ready-made formula for T, to last until Monday, and she made me open them all and drink a bit. Maybe if I was counting my blessings I could say that at least it wasn't breast milk, but, punk, I was not feeling very lucky. As a side-issue, I feel bad about feeding it to him now, because it mings so much, but he doesn't seem to mind. The containers are not resealable, so they're just wasted. </p> <p>I try to filch a bottle out of the bag to salvage one of them, and she yelps \"Don't touch the bag! You're on camera!\" and then she starts all over again. All that tasting, all over again. Even with swearwords, I could not do justice to the character of this woman. I would have to express it some other way, with a warlike mime. </p> <p>She gets a lipstick out of a side-pocket. \"That's pretty,\" she says, and I think, \"No way. You cannot be trying to make friends with me, not after all this, after you've made me drink a pint of formula, and then made me drink it all over again. That is too weird. That is totally messing with my understanding of human nature.\" \"You should have put it in a clear bag,\" she says, as she confiscates it. At least I can relax: my understanding of the species is intact, my head has not been messed with. Plus, I wasn't planning to feed it to T for his dinner and I have another just like it in my suitcase, in case she takes his dinner and I have to sustain him overnight on makeup that is older than he is.</p> <p>Haste we to the moment when she takes his dinner: Ella's Kitchen pouches are full of puree with sealed tops, which I guess I could have filled with explosives from underneath, but I don't think even a terrorism college could have supplied me the smarts to make a bomb that looked and smelled exactly like mashed pumpkin. \"Taste it,\" she said, and I did. \"You have to taste more than that,\" she said knowingly, like any idiot could swallow a small amount of gelignite, so the cunning criminal would only be unmasked once they'd eaten enough fake baby food to sink a fake Titanic. </p> <p>And then again with the broccoli, pear and pea. And the apple and banana. And then that red one whose flavour I didn't check because I thought if it was sweet potato I might heave, and C and T would have to wander around duty-free Boots buying the wrong mosquito repellent for ever. Then she let me through, pausing only to take away my mascara.</p> <p>I am a grown-up, of course, with a sense of consequence, so I didn't lose my shit and I didn't miss my flight. But next time anyone says \"Europeans love children\", really, what are they basing that on? The fact that the Italian airport didn't trash your kid's dinner, and at the French one, nobody punched him in the face? Seriously. Where else in the world would this be OK?</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers for the Independent Police Complaints Commission yesterday criticised the family of a barrister shot by firearms officers after a five-hour siege, accusing them of \"regrettable\" conduct.</p> <p>Mark Saunders's mother, Rosemary, stormed out and his sisters Charlotte and Jennifer began to cry after Dinah Rose QC said there was \"very great concern\" about statements made to the press purporting to describe the contents of a police video of the incident.</p> <p>Rose told the high court the tape had been shown to a family member in confidence and descriptions of its contents later given to the media were inaccurate. Further disclosures by the family risked prejudicing the IPCC's investigation, which had not been helped by their \"aggressive correspondence\", she added. </p> <p>\"It [the video] is obviously critical evidence and was not seen by the police officers who have made statements,\" she said. \"What has been made public by the Saunders family is not an accurate picture of what is seen in the video. It is not correct to say that at the moment Mr Saunders was shot the gun was being held limply in his left hand.\" </p> <p>The tape had been shared with the family \"as part of the attempt to maintain transparency by the IPCC\", she added.</p> <p>But Tim Owen QC, for Charlotte Saunders, said the IPCC had made a \"fundamental mistake\" in saying it had been shown confidentially. Discussions were continuing to establish why this statement had been made, he added. </p> <p>Charlotte Saunders has brought a judicial review, claiming the IPCC's investigation into her brother's death at his \u00a32.2m flat in Chelsea, south-west London, was unlawful because of the risk of \"collusion\" between police officers who were allowed to confer - as is normal practice - before making statements about the incident. She also alleges an unlawful failure to disclose sufficient information to her in the course of the investigation.</p> <p>Mark Saunders, 32, a divorce lawyer, died of multiple bullet wounds. He had shot at police officers, neighbours and buildings with a legally owned shotgun, but Owen claimed in his written argument put before Mr Justice Underhill that he had not fired a shot for 20 minutes when he was killed in a hail of 11 bullets on May 6.</p> <p>Rose said it was \"premature\" to bring the challenge because the investigation would not be finished until next March.</p> <p>She told the judge the IPCC denied acting unlawfully in declining to give Charlotte Saunders all the information she has asked for. \"Although the IPCC's investigation is at an early stage, significant amounts of information have already been provided to Ms Saunders,\" she said. </p> <p>She said the IPCC had repeatedly stated that it considers the practice of allowing officers to confer before producing accounts of a fatal shooting unacceptable, but a change in the rules would have to be made by the Association of Chief Police Officers. </p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<h2>Drivers caught out as photocard licences expire</h2> <p>Thousands of drivers could be unwittingly breaking the law because they do not realise that their photocard licence has expired, motoring organisations said yesterday. Those who do remember to renew will have to pay \u00a317.50, a charge the RAC has branded \"unreasonable\". Reminder letters are sent out by the DVLA two months before the expiry date. But the DVLA admits that more than 4,000 drivers whose licences had expired by the end of August had yet to apply for a renewal. The new-style licences, launched in July 1998, expire after 10 years, unlike the paper ones they replaced. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Soldier killed trying to defuse roadside bomb</h2> <p>A British soldier has been killed in an explosion in southern Afghanistan while trying to defuse a roadside bomb.

He is the 118th member of the British armed forces to be killed in Afghanistan since military operations against the Taliban and al-Qaida began in 2001.

Kingsley's greed left some of his \"vulnerable\" clients thousands of pounds poorer, Southwark crown court in London was told.

  "<p>Seriously bloody horrible in every particular, and uncompromisingly bleak to the very end, this looks to me like the best British horror film in years: nasty, scary and tight as a drum. It is a violent ordeal nightmare that brutally withholds the longed-for redemptions and third-act revenges, offering only a nihilist scream and a vicious satirical twist in our perceived social wounds: knife-crime, gangs and the fear of a broken society.</p> <p>Writer-director James Watkins once worked on the reasonable horror-thrillers Gone and My Little Eye, and this comes courtesy of the production team that brought us the recent, much admired, but in my view slightly overrated British horror The Descent. Eden Lake puts all of them in the shade. There are the inevitable folk memories of Deliverance here, but also hints of Peckinpah's Straw Dogs and perhaps even Dennis Potter's Blue Remembered Hills. And in its final act, as the face of anguished heroine Kelly Reilly becomes a wraith-mask of mud, blood and despair, she starts looking like something from a very English Apocalypse Now.</p> <p>Reilly plays Jenny, an infant-school teacher whose hunky boyfriend Steve has asked her away for an outdoorsy camping holiday by a lovely woodland lake. Steve is played by Michael Fassbender, a young and fiercely charismatic Irish actor who is suddenly and justifiably ubiquitous on our screens. Steve, very sweetly, has a romantic aim in view: he wants to propose, and is trying to find just the right time to do it. As they head out of town in Steve's flashy 4x4, laughing happily at Kylie Minogue's voice programmed into the satnav, everything seems lovely.</p> <p>But wait. When they arrive, they find their idyll has been bought by a real-estate company, which proposes to turn the land into a hateful \"gated community\"; the company has surrounded it with a fence and even given it a vulgar new name: Eden Lake. With a hint of the lairy aggression that is to prove so explosive, Steve insists they simply trespass, sneaking in through a gap in the fence. But their subsequent delicious sunbathing by this glorious stretch of water is soon disrupted by a scary gang of youths: a nasty bunch with a ferocious rottweiler. They are led by teen bully Brett (Jack O'Connell) who is surrounded by cringing courtiers and lieutenants, including a hapless young boy called Cooper, played by Thomas Turgoose. Tensely, Steve tries asking them nicely to turn their music down, and through a series of incremental provocations that are all too plausible, the confrontation escalates out of control.</p> <p>Quite recently, I saw a gutwrenching short film called Soft, by Simon Ellis, which evokes similar ideas to Eden Lake; then, as now, I was reminded of something that the late Alexander Walker, film critic of the London Evening Standard, once wrote about Kubrick's Clockwork Orange: we hate and fear our children - because they are going to kill us. Eden Lake has the same idea. The confrontation here isn't about race and not even exclusively about class; it's not about townies and hillbillies, or blacks and whites, or yuppies and chavs. At bottom, it's about older people and the young: a gang of feral children who are as powerful as adults. They instinctively exploit the indulgences and prerogatives extended to them as children, having semi-comprehendingly imbibed a sense of resentment and entitlement from their own elders.</p> <p>Cleverly managing both his narrative and the audience's expectations, Watkins periodically takes his hero and heroine out of danger and, in one of these illusory interludes of safety, they order breakfast at a local diner where the waitress, perhaps the mother of these killer-kids, jovially asks Steve if they have been \"terrorising\" him. When Steve can't help but answer, coldly, in the affirmative, she says, tauntingly, surely not - a big, grown-up bloke like him? Steve has a destructive machismo of his own, a settled intention never to lose face and be bullied by a bunch of children.</p> <p>There is a tremendous scene right at the beginning, in which Steve sees the gang's BMX bikes all parked outside someone's house, and he bull-headedly insists on marching in and confronting the parents. It is a teeth-gnawingly tense moment, because by swaggering but then sneaking around in an apparently empty house, Steve has suddenly put himself in the wrong. He is now the criminal, the arrogant aggressor, and his great big flashy car - in horrible contradistinction to the kids' titchy bikes - now labels him once again as the overdog, and that conspicuous motor makes him and Jenny all too trackable. It is a clever and suspenseful moment.</p> <p>From here, the violence gets worse and worse. It is as if Watkins has taken the famous news picture of the hoodie making the \"gun\" gesture behind David Cameron's back - and photoshopped a real weapon into his hand. But it is believable in a way that does not depend on a neurotic attention to sensational newspaper stories: it has its own internal logic. And when Jenny finally gets some kind of violent revenge, and this goes horrendously wrong, it is, once again, all too believable. Watkins crushes the good guys' last stand with a realist moment of despair and blundering horror to match Michael Haneke's tape-rewind scene in his Funny Games.</p> <p>Eden Lake is hardly for everyone: and I certainly can't claim to like it in any normal sense. There are, arguably, some plot-glitches relating to mobile phones, and why 999 is not at one moment dialled - though this can be explained by the principals' dazed inattention. Eden Lake is exceptionally well made, ruthlessly extreme, relentlessly upsetting. I am thinking of sending my therapy bills to Mr Watkins personally.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, yesterday warned the government not to try to artificially support the mortgage market as that could further prolong the year-long credit crunch. He also held out little immediate prospect of interest rate cuts to boost the flagging economy. </p> <p>Appearing before parliament's cross-party Treasury committee, King said the Bank did not have the resources to underpin lending across the entire financial system and thereby boost mortgage lending.</p> <p>The Treasury has commissioned Sir James Crosby to report on steps that could be taken to encourage more mortgage lending which could help prevent house prices from tumbling further.</p> <p>King said there were only two choices for the government - either to let the Bank's special liquidity scheme (SLS) help the financial system gradually return to health, or to fund the mortgage market through a state-run bank.</p> <p>\"It is not the purpose of central bank liquidity insurance to provide a source of long-term funding to the financial system - indeed it cannot do that. Only private savers or taxpayers, via the government, can provide such funds.\" </p> <p>But he made clear he did not favour a state-run mortgage bank offering cheap loans, saying it would impede the commercial banks' incentive to improve their balance sheets and find fresh capital so they can resume lending.</p> <p>\"That would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater,\" he said, adding he had come under no pressure whatever from the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to increase lending to the mortgage market.</p> <p>He said that next week the Bank would publish plans for a permanent scheme to provide liquidity to the banking system. The new scheme would provide short-term liquidity finance to banks but would not seek to replace or expand the SLS, which was launched in April and which closes its doors to new activity in October. Under the SLS, banks can swap high-grade, but illiquid, mortgage assets for more liquid Treasury bills for up to three years.</p> <p>King has been under pressure from commercial banks to extend the SLS beyond October 21 but he ruled that out, saying the scheme was, in any case, a \"one-off, a breathing space\" and the most generous of any central bank in the world. </p> <p>It had successfully provided \"significant\" liquidity to the banking system though the actual amount will not be revealed until after October 21. Banks, he said, were sophisticated operators for whom six months should easily be enough in which to work out their medium-term liquidity needs. He also said the Bank will next week announce arrangements under which banks can access short-term liquidity facilities from October 22 until the permanent arrangement is in place.</p> <p>\"The facility will be an important part of the contribution which the Bank can make to enhance the stability of the banking system,\" King said, adding there were signs of loan rates being reduced in the mortgage market for loan-to-value ratios of up to 70%.</p> <p>The Bank's executive director for markets, Paul Tucker, said some banks were strong again and competition was gradually increasing in the mortgage market. \"Conditions are difficult but not absolutely dire,\" he said, but warned that it was impossible to know how long it would be until the credit crunch was over.</p> <p>King said he hoped Darling would provide details in next month's pre-budget report about how the public finances would be returned to a sustainable position in the medium term, since the economic slowdown had pushed up the budget deficit.</p> <p>The economy was deteriorating more quickly than expected but, with inflation having picked up strongly and likely to rise to around 5% in the next month or two, he was concerned that wages could pick up in the new-year pay round. He stressed the Bank had to focus on bringing inflation back to its 2% target.</p> <p>But David Blanchflower, an external member of the Bank's monetary policy committee who has repeatedly voted to cut interest rates, said he was worried about unemployment shooting up and the economy slowing sharply as a result of the credit crunch and falling house prices. </p> <p>The pound fell to a two-and-a-half-year low against the dollar on his words, dropping below $1.75.</p>",

Mr Freedland and his friends might subject us to another rant in the Guardian, or - God forbid - denounce us in the UN. As much as we Americans fear the world's verdict, we insist on this annoying ritual of choosing our own leaders every four years.

Pity.</p> <p>To address the sinking feeling in Mr Freedland's stomach, I offer this advice: quit following the presidential race. It's doing you no good. Instead, get a life-size poster of the man you yearn for. Turn on some nice music, perhaps Beethoven's Ode to Joy. The next four years should pass much more pleasantly.<br><strong>Bill Ireland</strong><br>Ontario, California, USA </p> <p>I, too, am discouraged by current enthusiasm for the McCain-Palin ticket. Sarah Palin is a conservative extremist and her popularity is downright scary. If the citizens of the US vote McCain-Palin (or, more correctly, Palin-McCain) into the White House, I will conclude there is no intelligence remaining in most of America. We will have an extremist theocracy. But then the people will get what they deserve and should be ridiculed for making a bad choice (again). Probably the best outcome would be for the UK, Europe, Russia and the rest of the world to leave the US in the dust, surging ahead, as the US continues its \"historical decline\". Maybe that would take Americans off their high horses.<br><strong>Ann Ornitz</strong><br> Creve Coeur, Missouri, USA </p> <p>I have a small but significant piece of evidence that the world is desperate to rediscover its esteem for America and its people. At a recent international theatre gathering of young people in Liverpool - a diverse mix of about 250, ages between 16 and 25, from countries including Palestine, Nepal, Turkey, Brazil, India, Poland, Zambia, and Germany - a group from the US presented a play about race issues. There was a passing reference to Obama and a hope expressed that he will become the next president. This whole gathering - with all its wide differences of cultures, faiths, and economic, social and political backgrounds - rose to its feet as one body with a mighty cheer and applauded. If only the people of American could hear that message.<br><strong>Noel Greig</strong><br>Deal, Kent </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland finds it \"incredible\" that Barack Obama's positive reception abroad would harm his standing in the US. In fact, the early stages of Obama's world tour were well received and produced a bounce in his poll numbers. His Berlin speech reversed these gains not because of any isolationism on the part of the US electorate, but because it reinforced two damaging narratives about his candidacy. First, his vapid rhetoric spoke of an empty suit whose oratorical skills contrast sharply with his lack of substantive accomplishments and thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Second, in seeking to appear \"presidential\" in front of 200,000 foreigners, Obama foolishly blurred the line between a presumptive and a presumptuous nominee. His global popularity is less of an electoral liability than his perceived arrogance and elevation of style over substance.<br><strong>Alex Lindenberg</strong><br> Brighton, East Sussex </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland made my blood boil here in Sacramento, as he whines about our elections, like a spoiled child. Neither he nor any Englishman, Frenchman, Russian, African or Ecuadorian has the slightest say in our elections. The issues are vastly too complex for foreigners to comprehend, much less have a say in. I don't see anyone of Pakistani or African descent being touted as Britain's next prime minister. But to childishly simplify everything through the lens of skin colour defines the left's congenital stupidity. America saved Europe during three world wars, including the Cold War. Our blood, sweat and tears were not shed to have weaklings tell us how to save the world (by continuously selling out millions of \"other people\" to totalitarian monsters). Should Jonathan visit, he had better drink with professors or like types at home or in gay bars, but had better stay out of real bars in Sacramento.<br><strong>Miguel Giles</strong><br> Carmichael, California, USA </p> <p>It isn't so much that Sarah Palin has tipped the balance in polls, she has just hastened what would have been inevitable. McCain has no star quality, but he is white. Having lived in the US for two years, working as a nanny on Long Island, I encountered virulent racism while listening in the background at pool and dinner parties of the \"enlightened\" middle classes, even within earshot of their mostly black maids. It matters not how superior Obama may be as a candidate; come November, he is just a black man.<br><strong>Maggie Harris</strong><br> Crowborough, East Sussex </p> <p>Sarah Palin has certainly raised the profile of the Republican campaign, but that highlights media coverage, particularly in the UK, overwhelmed by Obama charisma to the extent they have not taken seriously McCain. The maverick white Republican senator is a war hero. He will do well in an overwhelmingly white conservative nation that sees itself at war. The 200,000 Berlin fans of Obama have no vote. America has always had a strong strand within its political culture that is inward-looking. We, on this side of the pond, may dislike a McCain presidency, but if that is the Americans' choice, they won't care.<br><strong>David James</strong><br>Kidlington, Oxford</p>",
  "<p>Councils are not snooping for snooping's sake: they are seeking to detect illegal activity, say the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services (Lacors). They acknowledge there may have been instances of over-zealous use of their investigatory powers by some councils, but 99% of the time, they say, these investigations lead to some form of prosecution or action. What's more, councils have always undertaken such investigations; the extension of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act legislation to local authorities simply made the processes more transparent. And with transparency comes publicity, often unwelcome. </p> <p>\"Councils sometimes fail to understand is why this should be such a touchy issue,\" Lacors says. It is working with the Home Office on a set of guidelines that will provide advice on these fraught areas. </p> <p>In his annual report, published in July, Sir Christopher Rose, the chief surveillance commissioner, said that local authorities use covert surveillance only as a last resort, but granted the need for a public debate. \"It is not acceptable,\" he wrote, \"to judge that because directed surveillance is being conducted from a public place, this automatically renders the activity overt or to assert that an activity is proportionate because it is the only way to further an investigation \u2026 I encourage any debate which assists in educating the public and which enables authorising officers to judge proportionality better.\"</p> <p><strong>Obstructions </strong></p> <p>Rose noted the rising number of Freedom of Information requests about surveillance, to which, he said, local authorities had responded \"inconsistently\". Councils not giving out information readily may be deemed obstructive. </p> <p>Local authorities are struggling to find a balance between enforcement and intrusion. It's a matter of efficiency rather than political philosophy, according to Chris Leslie, director of the New Local Government Network, particularly in collecting data. \"There are better ways to use the data we all share as a society and feel is reasonable,\" says Leslie. The NLGN recently published a pamphlet proposing the abolition of the 10-year national census. \"Never mind intrusion, what we should be asking is whether it's cost-effective continually to be asking people to resupply the same data.\" </p> <p>Public attitudes are mixed: in some areas, cameras are welcomed for their calming influence. No one has yet protested about the use of CCTV by the Environment Agency to monitor spots where rivers might flood. </p> <p>What is curious is how little local authorities seem able to convey the benefits of their actions. Indeed, many seem almost wilfully oblivious to the effect of their actions, however well-meaning, on the public and, more pertinently, how they could be interpreted by a hostile press. </p> <p><strong>Alarmist stories </strong></p> <p>The media does have a lot to answer for. As Rose notes, FOI requests about surveillance are a rich seam for journalists. They have led to alarmist stories about local councils running surveillance operations. </p> <p>There's also confusion about the purposes of data collection and investigation. The London borough of Islington sifted through rubbish from 1,000 homes to see what people were throwing away and help improve recycling. That got short shrift in the press. But when people understand that data is being used for the greater good \u2013 as when health statistics are collected anonymously \u2013 they tend to be far more tolerant. </p> <p>So is this yet another area where the public sector has failed to get over its message?</p> <p><strong>Don't believe the hype</strong></p> <p>\"Council snoopers\" became one of the headlines of the summer as the press, led by the Daily Mail, rampaged \u2013 lumping together investigations into fraud, environmental policy with longstanding campaigns against identity registration and speed restrictions. </p> <p>Tory politicians clambered on the bandwagon with shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve claiming powers designed to combat terrorism were being used \"to snoop on the lives of ordinary people\". </p> <p>The re-election of David Davies as Tory MP for Haltemprice \u2013 he had resigned his seat in protest at the government's plans to hold terrorist suspects for 42 days \u2013 may increase the temperature over these issues of liberty and order, leaving local authorities and other public bodies between the proverbial rock and a hard place.</p> <p>Public policy is being made in bits and pieces. In July Sir Ian Magee, a former permanent secretary commissioned by the Home Office, recommended much more data sharing about criminals between government agencies. </p> <p>The government said it would give both MPs and the information commissioner more scrutiny over the use of surveillance. But the prime minister has been robust in defending what he called the \"right to use 21st century solutions\" in fighting terrorism and organised crime, such as cameras, biometrics and DNA databases.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This article appears in this month's edition of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public\">Public</a> magazine</p>",
  "<p>I think I have the wrong room. A thin, glamorous woman with long blond hair, dressed all in black, is dancing across the polished wooden floor in the arms of another woman, and both are laughing. When I realise the glamorous woman is Leslie Ash, I must look shocked, because she asks what I was expecting her to be like. Before I can stop myself, I say, \"Like an old lady, frail, shuffling along.\" It's not the usual way to butter someone up for an interview (\"And really ill,\" I add for good measure), but she sits back in her chair and looks pleased to have proved me wrong.</p> <p>Ash hasn't been seen much in public since she contracted MSSA, a superbug similar to MRSA, in hospital four years ago. The illness almost killed her and left her paralysed; her doctors weren't sure if she would ever walk again but she proved them wrong, too. Occasionally, photographs appeared in newspapers of her in a wheelchair looking ill and exhausted, and lately walking with a stick. In her autobiography, which came out last year, she described how she had to be looked after like a baby and was contemplating a future where she might need constant care. So I'm surprised that she looks remarkably well even if she seems, to me at least, still quite vulnerable (her dance partner - her agent Michele - is sitting with us, as protective as a lioness). </p> <p>\"I'm frightened of going backwards,\" she says. \"I know that I have been very ill but now I feel 100% back, in my head.\" Ash says she started feeling like this only recently, in the course of making a new documentary, her first television job since she became ill. \"I wondered if I would have the stamina to do it. That's what I was scared of. I said yes to it before I really thought about it. Did I really want to open this can of worms up? But I think, again, that's part of the healing process.\" </p> <p>In her documentary, Face to Face, Ash looks at the growth of cosmetic treatments in Britain and meets several people for whom procedures have gone wrong. Of course, Ash herself is one of them. In 2002, she had silicone injected into her top lip to make it appear fuller, an increasingly common procedure and one that she had had before with no problems. Except this time, she had an allergic reaction and her lip swelled up and never really went down. The skin between her lip and nose hardened as the silicone fused with the muscles there. \"Which means there is nothing anyone can do about it,\" she says. \"If you start messing about with those muscles, I could end up even worse.\" Ash's humiliation was public - celebrity magazines and the tabloids found it hilarious and the term \"trout pout\" was coined for her. \"It was horrible,\" she says. \"I closed up, I hid away.\" One reason for doing the documentary, she says, was to talk about it openly and try and put it to rest.</p> <p>The other reason, she says, is because \"I don't want people to make the same mistakes I did. I wanted to show the industry was unregulated and how people can make a decision in a heartbeat that might potentially ruin the rest of their lives.\" Would she have anything else done? I expect her to look at me as if I'm mad, but she doesn't. \"I still want to look good and I'd never say never,\" she says. \"If I said I'd never have a facelift and then I decided to, I don't think I could cope with the backlash.\" But I would have thought the last place she would want to put herself willingly, for an unneccessary operation, was a hospital - even if she hadn't already had a cosmetic procedure that had backfired so spectacularly. \"By the time I think of having one,\" she says with a shrug, \"maybe you won't have to go into hospital.\"</p> <p>I can find Ash maddening. I like her enormously and I have nothing but admiration for the way she has battled to recover from her illness but, occasionally, I feel like shaking her. She seems, to me, unnaturally preoccupied with her looks, and I wonder what came first: if she has always been like that, or if it comes from being in showbusiness all her life (she was a stage-school kid, who made her first TV appearance in an advert when she was four). She had a breast lift after her two sons were born, and she would always go on diets before filming. Was she always insecure about the way she looked, even as a child? She nods. \"It's why I got into this business. I wanted to be glamorous, I wanted to be like a movie star.\" I sometimes think some people become actors because they have a need to be liked and I get the feeling this is especially true of Ash. \"Yes, probably,\" she says. \"I've gone through my whole life wanting people to like me. I've loved it when people said they liked me in Men Behaving Badly or Quadrophenia. It makes you feel special.\" She smiles. \"Now I couldn't give a flying fuck what people think.\"</p> <p>Once she hit 40, Ash focused her self-criticism on her face. \"These were the lines I was noticing,\" she says, running her fingers along the creases from her nose to the corner of her mouth. \"I had a bit of [collagen] filler put in there. Then you notice your lips get thinner and someone says, 'I can plump that up a bit.' I'm 48 now and I'm not looking forward to getting old.\" At the height of her fame, when she played Debs in Men Behaving Badly, Ash was the attractive, blond girl-next-door (or rather girl upstairs), but once that series finished in the late 90s, she noticed that the parts she was being considered for had changed. \"I was getting offered the 'mum' roles. I definitely noticed that I was ageing, and the way I looked was my bread and butter. There are so many actresses like me, and therefore you have to keep going to the gym and keep your hair looking nice. It is your job.\" Did she never think that she could simply refuse to conform? \"I couldn't afford to. At the time, we had Teatro [a members' club in central London that Ash ran with her husband, the former professional footballer Lee Chapman], two boys who were being privately educated. We had a mortgage to pay.\" Besides, she says, almost every other actor of her generation was getting work done on the sly, it's just that Ash was found out. She must have felt so vain and stupid, so angry with herself. \"Oh, I've done all that. That can only go on for so long and then you have to move on. And to be honest, it does fade into the background. I didn't think [my life] could get worse, to be honest.\" She laughs. \"It's like a line in a sitcom. 'It can't get any worse ...'\" But, of course, it did.</p> <p>In April 2004, Ash was admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital with a cracked rib and punctured lung. Ash revealed the details of what happened - after a drunken night, she and her husband had been having sex and she fell off the bed - to try to put a stop to rumours, which had been floating about for years, that Chapman was violent. In 1997, after a particularly bad row, Ash had stormed off to the home of Caroline Quentin, her Men Behaving Badly co-star. Chapman arrived, furious, kicked Quentin's door in and was arrested. Ash took out an injunction against her husband, but this was soon dropped. In her autobiography, she says she was confused and just did what everyone else was urging her to do, without realising the consequences. (Later, her sister Debbie alleged in a Sunday newspaper that Ash was \"in denial\"; Ash and her sister don't speak now.) \"It hurts,\" she says of the allegations, wary of saying more. \"We're very close and we always have been. We have two adorable children and I don't care about anyone else but the four of us. There are very, very few people in my life, and that's all you need really.\" In her book, Ash writes about the rows, blaming herself mostly (the worst of them, she says, would happen after she had been drinking). There had been problems in their marriage - particularly when Chapman was spending too much time at Teatro - but after her illness, the Chapman that appears in her book is kind, patient and incredibly supportive. \"He was the one thing I could depend on,\" she says now, pointing out that they recently celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary. \"He became my carer and I think he surprised himself. Lee was absolutely amazing.\"</p> <p>While she was in hospital recovering from the rib injury, she noticed that the site of the epidural on her spine looked infected but was repeatedly told there was nothing to worry about. It was only when she was home at their penthouse in Chelsea that she became violently ill and lost all feeling in her legs. She was rushed to hospital, where a surgeon told her the infection was spreading along her spinal cord and they would have to operate immediately, before it reached her brain and killed her. When she came round, she couldn't feel anything from the chest down and nobody could tell her whether she would ever walk again. \"I think the lowest point was when Lee and the boys would go home after a visit and I'd be left in the hospital room. I'd just look out of the window. That was very tough.\" What did she think her future would be like? \"I really didn't know. All I could think of was what I used to be like. I'd feel sorry for myself, get really depressed, cry a lot.\" </p> <p>She started physiotherapy and had to learn how to use all her muscles again, with no feeling in her legs. It was made harder because the damage also means Ash has no proprioception, the awareness of the position of one's body, which means she has no idea where her legs are unless she can see them. It was a long and exhausting process. \"The first thing you want to do is to be able to sit in a chair for five minutes,\" she says. \"Then the next thing is to get into a wheelchair, then on to crutches, then on to a stick, then get off a stick. I've had to learn to walk again.\" These days, Ash can walk - slowly and carefully with a stick (and without one at home). She is terrified of falling over in the middle of the road, or being photographed on the floor by paparazzi who, rather despicably, often follow her or jump out of vans and surprise her. She still has physiotherapy, can get very tired and will be on medication for the pain for the rest of her life. I don't know if it's the tiredness, or the medication, but her words are slightly fuzzy about the edges. </p> <p>In January, Ash was awarded \u00a35m compensation for loss of earnings. This was criticised, and comparisons were made with the low payouts the victims of the July 7 terrorist attack and injured soldiers receive. \"That made me feel really awful. It was a long four years and it was scary because we could have lost everything,\" says Ash of the legal battle. </p> <p>\"They've already changed the way they monitor epidural sites. They check up every hour and take swabs and send them away to see if there's any infection. So there has been a change, which I think will have prevented someone else from going through this. It sounds like a lottery win but it isn't. It's for the rest of my life. I had so many assessments [of my life and earnings] and it was horrible, because you feel you are doing something wrong, you feel guilty. But it means I can take a breath of relief that I'm not going to wind up in a situation like my mother or father where they got old and couldn't basically keep themselves. That's all I wanted - I wanted an apology and to know I would be OK for the rest of my life and not live in fear.\" Is she still angry? \"Yeah. But if you go down that road, it takes you to all sorts of dark places so you try not to.\" It must be hard though. \"Yes,\" she says in a small voice. </p> <p>Until now, Ash hasn't been able to work. \"I found that very difficult to accept,\" she says. \"I was on the phone to my agent saying, 'What's going on?' I went to one audition and I don't think they knew quite how bad I was. I realised while I was there I wasn't going to be able to do it. That was awful.\" Does she want to act again? \"I'd love to, but realistically. . .\" she trails off. \"It would have to be the right thing. There's no reason why disabled people can't be actors. Your feeling is to try and claw back your career. You don't want to lose it because it's taken you 30-odd years to get there and you know how quickly it can go. But I feel like my old self again. Mentally I am, even if I'm not physically. To be honest, I can get over not being able to do Strictly Come Dancing. My only worry is: will I ever get back into a job? I've supported myself since I was 15. I'd like to prove that there is a place for disabled actors.\"</p> <p>Ash says she has accepted that she is now \"disabled\" and always will be. \"Once you reach that conclusion, you have to get on with it,\" she says. \"It's not easy. Each day is challenging but there are lots of disabled people out there like me.\" She knows what it feels like to be ignored when you're in a wheelchair, because she used one for a long time. \"One thing about being disabled is you still want to look beautiful,\" she says. \"It took me a long time before I put any makeup on or went shopping for clothes. I never looked at magazines because I couldn't bear to look at pictures of models. Now, I realise that I still want to look good. But every disabled loo I've ever been into hasn't got a mirror and that suddenly came home to me - are disabled people not meant to care about the way they look? Not be sexy, attractive?\" </p> <p>I ask her how she feels when she looks in the mirror these days. \"I'm happy. I see someone whose face has completely changed in four years. I don't look ill any more. You used to be able to see the pain on my face. I looked older. The pain has gone, the worry, the fear. I do see a future. I appreciate everything so much more. It's a cliche to say that, but when your life is so much slower, you see much more.\" Does she ever feel sorry for herself? \"Constantly,\" she says, with a little laugh. But how can she say she's happy if she constantly feels sorry for herself? Surely it's one or the other. \"Yes. You have to choose,\" she says, getting up. \"I'm tired of being miserable.\" I watch her walk carefully with her silver-topped cane across the shiny polished floor to have her photograph taken, looking ready to face the world again and I think to myself that it would be a shame if, after everything she has been through, somebody didn't give Leslie Ash a break \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Leslie Ash: Face to Face is on ITV1 on September 23 at 9pm</p>",
  "<p>A secret order issued by George Bush giving US special forces carte blanche to mount counter-terrorist operations inside Pakistani territory raised fears last night that escalating conflict was spreading from Afghanistan to Pakistan and could ignite a region-wide war.</p> <p>The unprecedented executive order, signed by Bush in July after an intense internal administration debate, comes amid western concern that the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and its al-Qaida backers based in \"safe havens\" in western Pakistan's tribal belt is being lost.</p> <p>Following Bush's decision, US navy Seals commandos, backed by attack helicopters, launched a ground raid into Pakistan last week which the US claimed killed about two dozen insurgents. Pakistani officials condemned the raid as illegal and said most of the dead were civilians. US and Nato commanders are anxious to halt infiltration across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border of insurgents and weapons blamed for casualties among coalition troops. The killing of a US soldier in eastern Afghanistan yesterday brought American losses in 2008 to 112, the deadliest year since the 2001 intervention. The move is regarded as unprecedented in terms of sending troops into a friendly, allied country.</p> <p>But another American objective is the capture of Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader held responsible for organising the 9/11 attacks. He and his second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are thought to be hiding in the tribal areas of north and south Waziristan.</p> <p>Bush's decision to extend the war into Pakistan, and his apparent hope of British backing, formed the background to a video conference call with Gordon Brown yesterday. \"What's happening on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan is something where we need to develop a new strategy,\" Brown said before talking to Bush.</p> <p>Brown said he would discuss the border issue with Pakistan's new president, Asif Ali Zardari, who visits Britain next week.</p> <p>Bush's unusual move in personally calling the prime minister for an Afghan strategy discussion has led to speculation that the US president was trying to line up British support for the new policy, including the possible involvement of British special forces in future cross-border incursions.</p> <p>Bush's executive order is certain to cause strains with some Nato allies fearful that a spreading conflict could bring down Pakistan's weak civilian government and spark a wider war. Last night there were indications of open disagreement.</p> <p>James Appathurai, a Nato spokesman, said the alliance did not support cross-border attacks or deeper incursions in to Pakistani territory.</p> <p>\"The Nato policy, that is our mandate, ends at the border. There are no ground or air incursions by Nato forces into Pakistani territory,\" he said.</p> <p>Nato has 53,000 troops in Afghanistan, some of which are American. But the US maintains a separate combat force dedicated to battling al-Qaida and counter-terrorism in general. Nato defence ministers are due to discuss Afghanistan in London next week.</p> <p>Last week's raid, and a subsequent attack on Monday by a Predator drone firing Hellfire missiles, provoked protests across the board in Pakistan, with only Zardari among leading politicians refusing to publicly condemn it.</p> <p>Pakistan's armed forces chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said the army would defend the country's sovereignty \"at all costs\". He went on: \"No external force is allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan.\"</p> <p>He denied there was any agreement or understanding to the contrary. His comments were widely interpreted as a warning to Zardari not to submit to the American importunity. But his tough words also raised the prospect of clashes between US and Pakistani forces if American military incursions continue or escalate.</p> <p>Until now, Washington has regarded Pakistan as a staunch ally in the \"war on terror\" that was launched in 2001. But the alliance has been weakened by last month's forced resignation of the army strongman, former general Pervez Musharraf, and his replacement by Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's widower.</p> <p>Polls suggest most Pakistanis favour ending all counter-terrorism cooperation with Washington, which is blamed for a rising civilian casualty toll in Afghanistan and in the tribal areas.</p> <p>Yousaf Raza Gilani, Pakistan's prime minister, joined the chorus of condemnation yesterday. He reportedly told state media Kayani's warning that unilateral US actions were undermining the fight against Islamist extremism represented the government's position.</p> <p>Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs, and Robert Gates, defence secretary, told Congress this week that victory in Afghanistan was by no means certain and the US needed to take the fight to the enemy inside Pakistan.</p> <p>Mullen called for a \"more comprehensive strategy\" embracing both sides of the border. \"Until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate, the enemy will only keep coming,\" he said.</p> <p>US and Pakistani forces have clashed by accident in the past during operations to root out militants, although sections of the Pakistani military and intelligence services are said to harbour deep resentment about perceived American interference.</p>",
  "<p>The New York Post calls her \"a feminist dream\". National Public Radio asks if she's the \"new face of feminism\". And the Wall Street Journal, ever subtle, calls it \"Sarah Palin Feminism\". I call it well-spun garbage. (Yes, I'd even call it a pig in lipstick.) It seems you can't open a newspaper or turn on the television without running across a piece about how the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, is not just a feminist, but the feminist - a sign that all is right in the US when it comes to gender equality. (Turn in those Birkenstocks and picket signs, gals!) </p> <p>Palin's conservative cohorts are claiming her candidacy as a win for women and proof that it's Republicans who are the real agents of change. After all, what more could American women want in a vice-presidential candidate than a well-coiffed \"hockey mom\"?</p> <p>Never mind that Palin talks about her teen daughter's decision to keep her child while awaiting the chance to take that choice away from American women. Don't worry about how Palin cut funding for a transitional home for teenage mothers. And forget that, under Palin's mayoralty, women in Wasilla, Alaska, were forced to pay for their own rape kits to the tune of up to $1,200. </p> <p>We're not supposed to care about these issues because - say Republicans - we should just be happy that there's a woman on the ticket. The McCain campaign is cynically trying to recreate the excitement that surrounded Hillary Clinton's candidacy, believing that all women want is ... another woman. </p> <p>Ann Friedman, deputy editor of the American Prospect, wrote: \"In picking Palin, Republicans are lending credence to the sexist assumption that women voters are too stupid to investigate or care about the issues, and merely want to vote for someone who looks like them ... McCain has turned the idea of the first woman in the White House from a true moment of change to an empty pander.\"</p> <p>What's worse is conservatives can't understand why women aren't lining up to thank them. In fact, the same people who moaned that women - those darn feminists, especially - were only supporting Hillary because of her gender are now screaming to the rafters because they're not supporting Palin for the same reason. That's what makes Republicans pulling the feminist card that much more insulting - the stunning hypocrisy. The McCain touting himself as the person who will put a woman in the White House is the same man who joked that Chelsea Clinton is \"so ugly\" because \"her father is Janet Reno\". </p> <p>And despite the talk about being the party of change, appropriating feminist symbols - such as at a Pennsylvania rally, where people held up signs of Rosie the Riveter with Palin's face - and propping up anti-feminist women as trailblazers is typical of the Republicans.</p> <p>Organisations such as the Independent Women's Forum and Concerned Women for America, who call themselves the \"real\" feminists while fighting against things such as equal pay and legislation to combat violence against women, have been around (and funded by conservatives) for years. Their brand of feminism means benefiting from the gains of the women's movement while striving to keep other women down - all for a patriarchal pat on the head. Sound familiar?</p> <p>As the feminist writer Rebecca Traister says: \"Palin's femininity is one that is recognisable to most women: she's the kind of broad who speaks on behalf of other broads but appears not to like them very much ... It's like some dystopian future ... feminism without any feminists.\"</p> <p>The good news is, this twisted homage to feminism means conservatives must recognise it as a force in American politics - why spend so much time framing Palin as feminist if we're all just a bunch of hairy man-haters? The bad news, however, trumps all. If this campaign is successful, American women will suffer. We'll be under the thumb of yet another administration that thinks nothing of rolling back women's rights. </p> <p>No matter how many times feminists point out the hypocrisy of Republicans pulling the F-card, however, the bigger truth is that it's not Palin's anti-feminist bona fides alone that matter. While Palin is bad for women's rights, she's terrible for America. In addition to being investigated by her own legislature for abuse of power, she is also reported to have asked a librarian about the process for banning books in Wasilla, doesn't support sex education, and has made lying about her record unusually central to her candidacy - even for a politician. These are big warning signs that cut across gender lines. </p> <p>So while the McCain campaign holds Palin up as a shining example of feminism in action, let's not forget the truth about who's doing the spinning and what they're selling. Because the last thing America needs is another corrupt and lying politician - man or woman.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jessica Valenti, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.feministing.com\">Feministing</a> website, is the author of Full Frontal Feminism</p>",
  "<p>As Marcus Trescothick gazed upon his beloved Taunton, he did not resemble a man whose life is as good as over. He looked content, fulfilled and at the very least like he has negotiated a truce with the depressive illness that has ended his England career. Given a fair wind, he anticipates that he might play for Somerset until he is 40 - and still have ample time to smell the roses and hug the kids.</p> <p>Yet while he continues his process of rediscovery and seeks total release from the guilt and anxiety attacks that ultimately made his life as an England cricketer untenable, sporting life moves on. He has achieved, been celebrated and spat out. Once his autobiography has been digested, that basically will be that. Trescothick's physical illness should be self-explanatory. A cricketer on the international treadmill, recognised for his sensitivity and conscientiousness, is overpowered by the conflicting demands of incessant England touring and love for his absent family: his wife, Hayley, suffering from post-natal depression and wanting him home, a father-in-law who was seriously injured in a DIY accident, and a baby who failed to recognise him after his return from a long tour. With such stress came exhaustion, anxiety attacks and depression. He could soak up no more. He was a victim of burn-out.</p> <p>We register this and yet all that we wonder about is whether he will play for England again. We yearn for more of Trescothick, the genial, gentle bully of countless attacks. Don't bother us with the personal trauma of the fallible human, unless it is scandalous gossip - and there has been a sickening amount of that.</p> <p>As if providing proof that cricket does not want to listen, on the very day that Trescothick's autobiography was launched, the International Cricket Council was beset by more unsustainable scheduling as India undermined the rescheduled Champions Trophy itinerary for October 2009 with grandiose plans of its own. Greed - of players and administrators - silently eats away at the health of the game and those who play it.</p> <p>There will be more victims. Trescothick has seen the signs. \"Everyone on an England tour leaving their family is in the same boat. I have seen other players who find the first few days really tough, some worse than me for a few days, but then they get into the routine of being away, forget about the home life and flick a switch to switch into professional mode. You have to do that otherwise you go nuts - like I did.\"</p> <p>Mental health charities could find lasting benefit from his courage in exploring the physical illness that neither he, nor those around him, understood. He has rid himself of feelings of shame. Now he also talks of personal release. </p> <p>\"I have had it so cluttered up in my own mind, the whole two years, that seeing it in words helps. It was harrowing reading it [his autobiography] back, but I can now understand what was going on and rationalise it a bit more. The illness took control and I didn't know what to do. It gives me a reason - not an excuse - for the things that I did.\" But do not tell him that now England have stopped calling he is unfulfilled.</p> <p>\"I've loved this summer,\" he said. \"I've not noticed the rain. Today I'm about to leave Taunton and in five minutes I can be home, playing with the kids. </p> <p>\"I'm the happiest that I can be. I will be led on to a beanbag in the playroom to watch Pepper Pig, or Dora the Explorer, something like that. Ellie is 3\u00bd and she is getting massively into horses. Any horse that comes on the TV causes sheer excitement.\" </p> <p>His biggest error was to surrender to England's entreaties, led by the captain Michael Vaughan, to bow to his professional obligations to remain on the 2005 tour of Pakistan, with his father-in-law seriously ill in hospital and his wife pleading for him to come home. When he landed at Birmingham airport Ellie, less than a year old, did not recognise him. It was a jolt that many absentee parents will recognise.</p> <p>\"It is the worst thing in the world. The most precious thing to you in your life looks at you as somebody she has never met before. I felt ashamed and I felt like I had let them down by staying away and going on tour. How can you do that to somebody? I cannot do that any more. You couldn't pay me enough money to say that I am going on tour tomorrow and have to go through the process of saying goodbye to the kids.</p> <p>\"It is about being away from the people behind closed doors who make me feel comfortable. I don't want to let my life be dictated by what I can and cannot do. I have to do my job after playing cricket and if it means that I have to travel abroad I would like to think that I can still do it. But if it's not a barrier that I can overcome, so be it.</p> <p>\"You can't deny the celebrity stuff is good fun. Doing the book launch, everyone was paying me compliments and saying they wanted me back for England. That's the buzz you always get. You feel special for a day. Even now, I got a big score on TV the other week and that sort of thing has always driven me on - to make that big score when people are watching all round the world. Now I've had to reassess my goals in county cricket, to maintain the drive to keep showing people why I was good; when I played for England what made me different.\"</p> <p>His love for children also involves him with Children's Hospice South West through his benefit trust, and he would like to become more involved to help them build a home in Cornwall. Perhaps he will take to marathon walks, as another son of the Cider county, Ian Botham, has famously done for leukaemia research? \"Beefy is down here soon on another one,\" he said, \"but I'm not sure I'm going to jump on the back of his exploits. I walked with Beefy in Bristol a couple of years ago and I'd rather run than walk that fast. It's unnatural.\"</p> <p>For the moment, though, he has much to enjoy. Taunton's intimate ground sustains him in the way that Graeme Hick found peace at Worcester. The spectators are supportive, the pitches like Karachi by midsummer, the boundaries invitingly short. Time for many more slog-sweeps? \"Lots,\" he said, \"but I'm using my feet more this summer and hitting straighter - I've no idea why.\"</p> <p>He concludes: \"I'd love to think that maybe I'll finish cricket at 40, say, and then I can be on the golf course as much as I can, chill out and relax, a few beers with the lads and go home again. I was playing golf over at Saltford in Bristol for my benefit and on one of the holes on the back nine you can stand on the tee and one way you can look over the hills and the villages towards Bath and the other way look right over Bristol. It's spectacular. You think to yourself, 'the teeing-off can wait a minute'.\"</p> <h2>The public acclaim and private agony</h2> <p><strong>Highs</strong></p> <p><strong>1995</strong></p> <p>Made captain of England Under-19s.

  "<p>Journalists were invited yesterday to inspect one of the new London Tube shelters about which there have been many rumours, some of them extravagant. There are eight shelters, each with bunks for 8,000 people. They have been built under Tube stations, four on the north of the Thames and four on the south.</p> <p>The shelters have all been built to a common design which will enable them to become part of a new underground railway after the war. The basis is two tunnels side by side, each of them 16 feet in diameter and divided by a concrete slab into an upper and lower deck, so that the height of each deck is some eight feet. This gives in effect four parallel tunnels, each about 1,200 feet long and provided with bunks for 2,000 people. </p> <p>Each of these four tunnels is divided into four sections by cross passages in which are the medical aid posts, lavatories, machinery control rooms, and so forth. In each section is a canteen. Some fold up to form back rests for a lower tier of bunks and so provide comfortable benches for sitting during the early evening. </p> <p>The shelter inspected yesterday is between 75 and 110 feet below ground level, and the tunnels are lined with reinforced concrete with cast-iron linings at junctions. </p> <p>There are five entrances. The biggest and easiest is a wide staircase from the Tube station above, which leads down to the central cross-passage of the shelter. The other four entrances are from the ground outside, and each consists of a small emergency lift and a staircase descending side by side and finally reaching the upper decks of the tunnels at points midway between their ends and the central cross-passage. </p> <p>All parts of the shelter can be reached from all five entrances, so that even if four entrances are blocked by bombing none of the shelterers will be cut off from escape. There are altogether four medical aid posts, each of which will be manned by a doctor, a sister and four nurses, all of them voluntary. </p> <p>[The shelter will be run by] full-time wardens, part-timers and also volunteers from the shelterers. Of the eight shelters two are ready and another five are so nearly ready that they could be used at once in emergency.</p> <p>The Minister of Home Security will decide when they are to be opened. His policy is to keep them in reserve until their extra accommodation is actually needed. At present the present shelterers fall far short of the available shelters. </p> <p>In the meantime no applications from anybody for tickets or admission to the shelters will be accepted.</p>",
  "<p><br>Whisper your suggestions for songs about revenge into Don Corleone's ear ... and maybe he'll oblige. Photograph: AllStar<br>All major world incidents are followed by a period of reconciliation and reconstruction, and so it is \u2013 on a micro scale \u2013 with Readers Recommend. Last week's historical events theme provoked one of the most heated blogs I've overseen thus far; for my money, it was also among the most stimulating and thought-provoking. I probably should have chosen a simple, happy theme for this week \u2013 flowers, say, or sweet things \u2013 but those have been done already, so instead let's stay in an obstreperous mood and look at songs about revenge.</p> <p>The picture of history that can be formed from this week's A-list is necessarily selective. Just as I was worried that it was all looking a bit academic and earnest, I happened upon saneshane's post on the RR <a href=\"http://readersrecommend.blogspot.com/\">Overspill blog</a> about the Cold War/divided Berlin, and the next thing I knew I was dancing around the room to Nena's 99 Luftballons. OK, it's not strictly speaking based on a historical event \u2013 unless we count the sighting of red balloons in the sky from a gig, and I don't think we do \u2013 but it's an irresistible song that makes the Top 10 a lot more fun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, to make room for it, Gillian Welch's absorbing but (and I say this as a devoted fan) slightly dry April 14th Pt 1 had to be booted out, so she opens this week's B-list, followed by Linton Kwesi Johnson's Di Great Insohreckshan, Bob Marley's Buffalo Soldiers, Derrick Morgan's Forward March, John Coltrane's Alabama, the Men They Couldn't Hang's Ghosts of Cable St, the Pioneers' delightful Long Shot Kick de Bucket, Victor Jara's Preguntas Por Puerto Montt, Naseer Shamma's tremblingly beautiful L'abri d'al-Amiriyya and, somewhat for comedy value, the Philadelphia All Stars' Let's Clean Up the Ghetto, a song that could even make doing housework fun. I feel vaguely troubled that the A-list predominately features white artists/history, the B-list predominately black: how typical of the way history is assessed and written. </p> <p>And so for this week's theme, revenge. I realise there is a strong argument for songs that are themselves the act of revenge to appear in this list. However, one of the first RR playlists was dedicated to what Dorian Lynskey dubbed \"hatchet jobs\", attacks on individuals or places that included, among others, Shellac's Prayer to God, Bob Dylan's Positively 4th Street and Martha Wainwright's Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole. So it's my feeling that this list should focus instead on songs that describe or explore the concept of revenge, rather than take it themselves. </p> <p>Deadline for recommendations is midday Monday; please check the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/readersrecommend \">RR archive</a> for Dorian's hatchet job list and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/apr/20/readersrecommendtheazofal\">A-Z</a> to see if a song you want to recommend has appeared on a previous RR playlist.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama today made a belated personal appeal to Bill Clinton for advice on how to fight back against a resurgent Republican presidential campaign.</p> <p>The lunchtime meeting in New York between the two towering Democratic figures comes amid growing despair at Obama's slide in the polls over the last week. Democratic figures are openly expressing fears that Obama does not have a strategy to counter the rising appeal of John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Although Clinton extravagantly praised Obama in his speech to the Democratic convention in Denver last month, the relationship between the two has remained strained from the bitter Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton earlier this year.</p> <p>The meeting, which took place at the headquarters of Clinton's foundation in Harlem, was their first face-to-face encounter since the primary season ended last June. The two men have spoken on the phone on only two occasions since Obama won the nomination.</p> <p>In an attempt to smooth the way for the meeting, Obama said he saw parallels between his own campaign and Clinton's in 1992: a relatively unknown politician fighting the Republicans against a backdrop of an ailing economy.</p> <p>\"You know, I've got lunch with Bill Clinton, which I'm looking forward to,\" he told David Letterman on Wednesday night. \"There's nobody smarter in politics and he is going to be, you know, he's going to be campaigning for us over the next eight weeks, which I'm thrilled by because, you know, the race that he ran in '92 is -- it was similar to what's taking place now.\"</p> <p>Clinton extended the lunch offer to Obama about a week ago -- before Palin began to energise the Republican base -- after patiently waiting for months for the Democratic candidate to get in touch.</p> <p>If they had met earlier, it would have been characterised as Obama meeting Clinton from a position of strength, but coming this week, it adds to the sense of Obama being on the defensive and needing help putting his campaign back on course.</p> <p>Obama said Clinton had been successful in reaching out to people in 1992 on the economy and he would like to use him in that role in this campaign, telling people \"why we need to change the economy in a fundamental way so it works for middle class families so that they can get ahead, so that they can send their kids to college, I think he can be a great advocate on behalf of the campaign.\"</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has been actively campaigning for Obama in battle line states. However, she has drawn a line against making personal attacks on Palin, Clinton insiders said.</p> <p>Clinton is happy to attack the Republicans over policy but not on personality, in part because she sees this as the role of the vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden, but also because she thinks it is a strategic mistake to engage in personal criticism of Palin.</p> <p>However, Clinton did add to the Democrats' defence of Obama who has been under attack for using the phrase \"lipstick on a pig\" to describe McCain's recycled policies. Republicans have accused Obama of insulting Palin.</p> <p>Clinton dismissed the notion at a press conference today.<br>\"Barack has made this clear,\" she said. \"It was in no way meant as an affront.\" </p> <p>While Bill Clinton will also go out on the trail for Obama, the election timetable is narrowing.</p> <p>The former president has many commitments over the next few weeks, including his annual Global Initiative conference in New York later this month, which attracts leaders from the world to discuss</p> <p>A new poll out today showed Obama's poll lead slipping in a trio of battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p> <p>A Quinnipiac University poll showed McCain pulling away in Florida, with a lead of 50% to Obama's 43%. The Republican was narrowing the gap in Pennsylvania, with Obama on 48% and McCain 45%. Obama maintained his lead in Ohio, 49% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>Officially, the Obama camp has tried to downplay the polls, saying they are not predictive of the outcome next November.</p> <p>However, there were signs this week of a concerted effort to push back against Republican attacks. One of Obama's closest advisers, Valerie Jarrett, told the Wall Street Journal today that Obama had told her in a phone conversation that he was not going to let Palin hijack media attention any longer. Echoing the view reached by Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats, he told Jarret he would desist from personal attacks on Palin and \"stay focused on John McCain\".</p> <p>Obama's bad week became worse when the National Rifle Association stepped up its opposition to him. The association, which has millions of supporters in the US and has so far played little part in the campaign, sees Obama as hostile towards gun ownership.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to imagine Michigan's governor Jennifer Granholm morphing into the moose-shooting, conservative-leaning, ponytail-wearing Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</p> <p>But that's exactly what she'll do over four days in the coming weeks as she acts as a sparring partner for Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden as he prepares for a televised debate with Palin, the governor of Alaska, in St Louis, Missouri on October 2.</p> <p>Granholm said in a TV interview that she thinks she was picked because she's the only other woman governor, besides Palin, with children at home.</p> <p>\"She's a real person and has real-person issues,\" Granholm told MSNBC in an interview on Wednesday. \"But people want to know, 'What are you going to do for me?' \"</p> <p>Granholm supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton until she dropped out of the race.</p> <p>Granholm and Palin have a lot in common. They're both sports mums: Granholm's children play soccer and basketball; Palin's kids play hockey. Both women are in their 40s. Palin was Miss Wasilla in 1984 and a third-place finisher in the Miss Alaska contest, while Granholm was Miss San Carlos, California in 1977. Both were criticised for lack of experience when they ran for higher office. Both are the first women in their respective states to become governor.</p> <p>Their politics, however, are completely different. Palin is conservative and opposes abortion; Granholm is liberal and is an advocate of a woman's right to choose. So, too, their education: Granholm graduated from Harvard's law school; Palin from the University of Idaho's journalism school.</p> <p>Granholm is a natural pick, said Lansing, Michigan political consultant Robert Kolt. She has been through two tough gubernatorial campaigns with many debates against Republicans Dick Posthumus in 2002 and Dick DeVos in 2006.</p> <p>\"She has great communication skills. She's smart, and she's a quick study,\" Kolt said. \"She'll be a great stand-in. She'll know all the lines.\"</p> <p>Standing-in requires more than just memorisation, though.<br>Former Republican congresswoman Lynn Martin of Illinois played the role of Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro when then vice-president George Bush was preparing for the 1984 election. The role required hours of research into Ferraro's speeches, record in Congress, interviews with the media and her life story, Martin told a Detroit, Michigan newspaper on Wednesday. At the time, Martin, a first-term congresswoman, was a friend of Ferraro, despite their different parties.</p> <p>\"I still think the world of Gerry. But back then, it was both scary and historic,\" Martin said. \"We're talking so much about senator Clinton and governor Palin now, but for Gerry Ferraro, it was a tough road. And Bush had never debated a woman before. It was scary for the guys, too.\"</p> <p>Martin looked at every nuance, even speeding up her slower-paced Midwest speech to mimic the rapid-fire talk of Ferraro, a New Yorker. When Bush's wife, Barbara, spoke to her before the first of three debate rehearsals and told her to \"Be rough on him. He's too full of himself,\" Martin's first thought was, \"Easy for you to say. It isn't your career on the line.\"</p> <p>The first rehearsal went poorly, Martin recalls. By the third, Bush was ready.</p> <p>\"Virtually every question that came up, we had covered. When Ferraro said, 'Don't condescend to me,' it was a line I had said during the rehearsals,\" Martin said.</p>",
  "<p>Today, as we pause to remember the 3,000 people who died in the dreadful attacks of September 11 2001, it is also important to remember that, in terms of the Bush administration's response, the bitter legacy of that day remains a deep stain on America's moral standing.</p> <p>In order to pursue a \"war\" against a group of terrorist criminals, the administration flouted the US Constitution and the bill of rights, dismissed the Geneva conventions, endorsed imprisonment without charge or trial, created a system of show trials for terror suspects out of thin air, granted themselves the right to spy on American citizens with impunity, and invaded a sovereign country without justification.</p> <p>Although it is reassuring that both presidential candidates have pledged to close Guant\u00e1namo, and Barack Obama has signalled that he will act to withdraw US forces from Iraq, neither Obama nor John McCain has yet spelled out in detail how Guant\u00e1namo will be closed.</p> <p>In addition, there has been no talk of what lies behind the notorious offshore prison in Cuba: a network of unaccountable prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the hundreds of other prisoners, subjected to \"extraordinary rendition\", who are languishing in jails in third countries or in secret facilities run by or overseen by the CIA.</p> <p>Decisive leadership is now required to correct these mistakes, and to revive the United States as a country founded on the rule of law. </p> <p>Some of this can be accomplished with a few pieces of crucial legislation \u2013 upholding the absolute ban on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, prohibiting the use of \"extraordinary rendition\", holding prisoners seized in wartime in accordance with the Geneva conventions, and bringing criminals to justice within the US court system.</p> <p>Other problems, however, require painstaking attention to the details, as my colleagues at <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/\">Reprieve</a>, the legal action charity, understand only too well. Reprieve's lawyers represent 31 of the 263 prisoners still held in Guant\u00e1namo. One of these men, British resident <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_binyammohammed.htm\">Binyam Mohamed</a>, is facing a trial by military commission at Guant\u00e1namo (a system <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/26/uk.lords\">condemned</a> by Lord Steyn as a \"kangaroo court\"). </p> <p>Mohamed is a victim of rendition and torture, and his lawyers are currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/usa.usforeignpolicy\">attempting</a>, through the high court, to persuade the British government to release potentially exculpatory evidence in its possession relating to his case. Their reasons are simple: without this information, they will be unable to prepare an adequate defence, as a steady flow of information relating to the trials has <a href=\"http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAN1337894520080814\">demonstrated</a> that they are designed to secure convictions, and to prevent all mention of torture. Until this system is closed down, and the trials transferred to the mainland, Guant\u00e1namo will remain as a beacon of injustice.</p> <p>Nine of Reprieve's other clients have been cleared for release from Guant\u00e1namo, after multiple review boards, because the authorities have concluded that they do not pose a threat to the US, but they remain in Guant\u00e1namo either because of treaties preventing the return of foreign nationals to countries where they face the risk of torture, or, in other cases, because they are, literally, stateless. </p> <p>Examples include: several <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/documents/08.06.17theforgottenitalianresidentsinguantanamo.pdf\">Italian residents (pdf)</a> of Tunisian origin, whose return to Tunisia would be a human rights disaster; two Saudi residents, born in Saudi Arabia but spurned by the government because their parents are from <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_mohammedelgharani.htm\">Chad</a> and <a href=\"http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-guantanamo-testimonials-project/testimonies/prisoner-testimonies/ayman-al-shurafa\">Palestine</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2169795.ece\">Ahmed Belbacha</a>, an Algerian who has launched a court appeal to prevent his repatriation, because of legitimate fears about his safety. Although Belbacha lived in the UK and had applied for asylum, he was not technically a resident when he took a holiday in Pakistan in 2001 that led to his kidnapping and transportation to Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Until these cases are resolved, and new homes found for these men, Guant\u00e1namo will remain open as an affront to US justice, and a corrosive reminder of the grave errors \u2013 the lack of screening, the presumption of guilt, and the bounty payments for \"al-Qaida and Taliban suspects\" \u2013 that led to the prison being filled with innocent men and Taliban foot soldiers who had no knowledge of al-Qaida or the 9/11 attacks.</p>",
  "<p>Oh heinous deed! Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks company are <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/09/is-disturbia-a.html\">being sued</a> for allegedly stealing the plot of last year's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486822/\">Disturbia</a> from Alfred Hitchcock's classic <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/\">Rear Window</a> produced 54 years ago. </p> <p>Are they serious? They <em>are</em> serious and, who knows, they may even be right given the ludicrous way US copyright law has been gradually extended to 95 years after the copyright was established, thanks to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act\">Sonny Bono copyright extension act</a> of 1998. This is supposed to protect artistic creativity. In fact it does exactly the opposite. </p> <p>Of course singers, songwriters and authors should be protected for a period even though much of their work has often been inspired by other artists' ideas. But the idea that they, or more likely a corporation that has bought the rights, should somehow have the legal right to them for long after the death of the author is counter-productive.</p> <p>Consider. If such laws had been in operation in the 16th and 17th centuries in the UK it would have led to the assassination of the greatest-ever period of theatrical creativity. And we might never have known about it because what would never have been written out of fear of copyright would never have been known about. So it would have been bye bye Shakespeare, the greatest plagiarist ever to strut the stage. </p> <p>It wasn't just his regular sources such as Holinshed's Chronicles (the basis of the history plays) and Ovid. This man took entire plots and characters. Start reading <a href=\"tinyurl.com/565smv\">King Leir</a>, written a few years before King Lear and you will instantly recognise the plot and the characters but Shakespeare turned a run-of-the mill play into an enduring masterpiece. The Merchant of Venice was a response to Marlowe's <a href=\"tinyurl.com/6ks6w5\">Jew of Malta</a> and The Winter's Tale was based on Pandosto, a very popular novel written by Robert Greene in 1588. And so on, and so on. The Elizabethans and Jacobeans thrived on competition - trying to outdo each other with similar plots.</p> <p>Turn now to <a href=\"http://www.scrabble.com/\">Scrabble</a>, a game invented by Alfred M Butts who died 15 years ago aged 93 but never made any money out of it. Recently some enterprising Indian brothers produced <a href=\"tinyurl.com/5vfwc2\">Scrabulous</a>, a much better online version of the game prompting the current owners of the copyright to issue a \"cease and desist\" order which has resulted in the game being withdrawn and both Scrabble and the brothers producing different, but by all accounts inferior, versions online. Why on earth, shouldn't a game involving the re-arrangement of words on a board invented over 60 years ago not be open to anyone to improve after an initial period, say 20 years, of protection?</p> <p>The crux of the matter is what is the period of time for copyright that balances the rights of creators to make money from their ideas with the needs of an economy to maximise creative potential by allowing others to produce alternative versions. Until copyright was introduced in the 18th century for authors and later engravers (for a period of 14 years) it didn't exist. It was absolutely right that the rights of creators should have some protection, the question is how long. Such academic research as there is suggests that around 15 years is the period during which the maximum economic benefits could be reaped. </p> <p>Maybe the role model should be patents which last for 20 years. Companies, particularly pharmaceutical ones, spend far more than the music and film industries on research. They have a huge incentive to get as much money as they can within 20 years when they know they will have to give their patents up (unlike the makers of Scrabble who just sat on an existing model with little incentive to improve it). At the same time the pharmaceutical companies know that the patents of their rivals will expire after 20 years so they can plan to market better versions of them for their own, and the consumers' satisfaction. Everyone gains.</p> <p>If Steven Spielberg has broken a law it is a law that is only on the statute book because of the power that producer lobbies have in framing law. The consumer doesn't get a look in. Spielberg should fight to get it changed. The law is often called an ass, but when it becomes an ass-assinator of creativity, that is the time to call a halt.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, the McCain campaign released an advert that featured video footage of Barack Obama saying \"But, you know, you can't \u2013 you can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig,\" and labeled that footage \"Barack Obama On: Sarah Palin,\" thus implying the Democratic presidential nominee was calling GOP veep nominee Sarah Palin a pig. The ad has since been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/CBS_takes_down_McCain_webad_suggests_its_misleading.html?showall\">pulled</a>, because the campaign also used footage of CBS anchor Katie Couric without securing the proper permission first (<a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1594443/20080909/heart.jhtml\">an</a> <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/08/mccain-sucks-at.html\">ongoing</a> <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/07/mccain-campai-1.html\">problem</a> with the McCain campaign \u2013 or, perhaps more evidence of McCain's emulation of Bush, showing up in his contempt for the law).</p> <p>Viewed in the context of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPd4yk0x-eg\">the stump speech</a> from which the \"lipstick on a pig\" line was pulled, it's clear that Obama was not directly calling Palin a pig:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"John McCain says he's about change, too. And, so, I guess his whole angle is: Watch out, George Bush. Except for economic policy, healthcare policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really gonna shake things up in Washington. That's not change. That's just calling something, the same thing, something different. But, you know, you can't \u2013 you can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The pig in question is John McCain's policies, not Sarah Palin.</p> <p>But was it still sexist?</p> <p>Obama's had what we'll call a bit of a problem using <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/01/fighting-sexism-is-meant-to-be.html\">sexist</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-new-dissed-hill-is-this.html\">dog</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/02/periodically-speaking.html\">whistles</a> and <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/05/tell-me-he-did-not-really-say-this.html\">soubriquets</a>, and his campaign has not been above using <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/01/heydid-you-know-hillarys-big-girly.html\">overt sexism</a> and engaging in <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-taking-high-ground-is-important.html\">double standards</a> when it's suited him. And it's no secret that I think he's got to improve the way he speaks (at minimum) about women's issues, from <a href=\"http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/02/28/words-mean-things-part-2/\">reproductive</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/07/putting-obama-comments-on-third-term.html\">rights</a> to <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-write-letters_11.html\">AIDS prevention</a>.</p> <p>It's a misconception that I'm hard on Obama for this stuff because I don't like him; the truth is that I want him to beat John McCain \u2013 no, not just beat him: I want him to trounce John McCain by double digits and ensure that the man never comes within 100 yards of the White House unless on a tourist excursion during his long overdue retirement. (Not because he's old, but because he sucks.) I'm hard on Obama because I don't want him to win on the back of misogyny and because I want him to be solid on women's issues, which will help him win.</p> <p>But the point is, I'm hard on him. And calling his \"lipstick on a pig\" line sexist?</p> <p>Doesn't fly.</p> <p>It might have been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/johnmccain.uselections2008\">dog whistle</a> \u2013 except for the fact that dog whistles have to make some sort of sense. In the context of Obama talking about McCain's policies, and how are in perfect alignment with Bush's policies, suddenly implying Sarah Palin's a pig is utterly nonsensical. It's a non sequitur. However, implying that McCain's dressing up the same old shit as change is like putting lipstick on a pig, well, that makes sense.</p> <p>If Obama had been talking about Palin being added to the ticket, and how, even though she's a woman, she embraces the same anti-feminist policies as every other bloody Republican, and that's no more real change than putting lipstick on a pig is, <em>that</em> would be a dog whistle. Context matters \u2013 and if that's the context we were talking about, I would be writing something very different indeed.</p> <p>But that's not what happened.</p> <p>It was nonetheless exceptionally tone-deaf; Palin had, merely a week earlier, taken to the national stage and firmly associated herself with the image of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">a pitbull in lipstick</a>. Inevitably, the \"lipstick on a pig\" line was going to invoke that widely-discussed bit of Palin's address, and Obama should have known to lay off of it. There's no reason to hand the most mendacious people in the world stuff to use against you.</p> <p>And use it against him they did \u2013 positioning themselves as some sort of feminist crusaders, even as they simultaneously <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK4oWay1VbE\">cast their own veep candidate</a> as a helpless damsel being stalked by wild animals.</p> <p>It's breathtakingly audacious, and just as infuriating.</p> <p>Because here's the thing about the GOP erroneously playing \"the gender card\" by co-opting feminist rhetoric and twisting it into some funhouse mirror version of feminism to be wielded as a weapon against the Democrats: It contributes to a cultural environment in which legitimate complaints about sexist rhetoric are already not taken as seriously as they should be, where they are routinely dismissed with charges of hypersensitivity and hysteria. That the GOP will further discredit feminism in the process of destroying Obama is not a flaw of this strategy, but a feature.</p> <p>That's bigger than Obama \u2013 and that's why I'm hard on him.</p> <p>He can't give them anything.</p> <p>Not an inch. Not a word.</p> <p>They don't fight fair.</p> <p>And they don't care a whit about sexism, except insofar as it can be used to their advantage \u2013 like being levied as a charge against an opponent. Even when he isn't being sexist.</p>",

  "<p>It's been an unsettling year to be a Kingsnorth. Blessed with a surname which for most of my life people have found it impossible to spell, I'm suddenly all over the news. But not in a good way. </p> <p>I keep hearing that Kingsnorth is filthy and destructive and should not, under any circumstances, be allowed to expand. Everywhere I turn, people are talking about fighting Kingsnorth, <a href=\"http://www.nonewcoal.org.uk/\">stopping Kingsnorth</a> or shutting down Kingsnorth (shutting up <a href=\"http://paulkingsnorth.net/\">Kingsnorth</a> I'm more familiar with). Thousands of angry hippies have been converging on wet fields threatening to chain themselves to bits of Kingsnorth. There are even \"stop Kingsnorth\" T-shirts. Maybe this is how it feels to be Ian Huntley. </p> <p>Still, even I was impressed when six <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a> activists managed to climb up the inside of the main chimney of the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent last October. Once at the top, they abseiled down the side and began daubing a giant and unequivocal message to the government on it. The message was intended to be \"Gordon, bin it!\" Unfortunately the police managed to serve an injunction on them by helicopter halfway through the process, so the message ended up as the rather less impressive \"Gordon\".</p> <p>A chimney named Gordon might seem more like a Turner prize contender than one of the obvious turning points in the long, uphill battle to prevent climate change. But a turning point it may turn out to be, for after an expensive and extremely detailed trial at Maidstone crown court, the six climbers were yesterday found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">not guilty</a> of causing criminal damage, despite the fact that they had openly admitted to doing so.</p> <p>The reason, unlike the case for the defence, was simple. The jury had decided to accept the climbers' case that the damage they did was justifiable if it helped prevent the undeniably greater damage that would be done by climate change. This is not the first time that a jury has accepted a \"lawful excuse\" defence in a criminal damage case \u2013 but it is the first time it has happened in relation to climate change. It will doubtless make Gordon (the prime minister, not the chimney) nervous as he contemplates whether or not to go-ahead with a new coal plant at Kingsnorth; a decision which will ultimately decide whether or not the UK has <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/08/05/coal-scuttled/\">any chance</a> of meeting its targets to reduce its climate-changing emissions, and on which the cabinet apparently remains <a href=\"http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/1312868/cabinet_split_over_new_coalfired_power_station/index.html\">split</a>.</p> <p>Whether or not the court decision leads to a rash of similar protests elsewhere remains to be seen. Whether it ultimately helps to stop climate change \u2013 if that is even possible given the point we've reached and the demands of our resource-greedy global economy \u2013 remains to be seen too. But what it maybe could do \u2013 and certainly should do \u2013 is bring home to the UK, where we still all have our heads stuck firmly in the sand, the connection between action and consequence.</p> <p>The court in Maidstone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/10/activists.carbonemissions\">heard</a> from James Hansen of Nasa, one of the world's leading climate experts, that the carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. They heard that properties just down the road from Gordon the chimney, on the Kent coast, were already suffering from sea level rises. They heard from Inuit leader Aqqaluk Lynge about how Inuit houses were already sliding into the sea. They decided that such things justified the criminal damage that the climbers had done. In other words, they accepted the connection between powering British homes and the rapidly-altering global climate.</p> <p>The difficulty with the climate change <a href=\"http://climatedenial.org/\">narrative</a> has always been how big it is. The idea that turning on your kettle helps to drown polar bears has never really sunk in with many people at any level beyond the theoretical. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the Kingsnorth verdict, with the full weight of the law backing it up, will make that link clearer in our minds. If it does, perhaps all that persecution will have been worth it.</p>",
  "<p>Two protesters accused of taking explosive devices to Minnesota to disrupt the Republican National Convention are being investigated for possible links to this summer's still unsolved blaze at the Texas governor's mansion.</p> <p>Department of Public Safety officials won't say whether the men - 22-year-old David McKay and 23-year-old Bradley Crowder - are suspects in the June 8 arson, which gutted the governor's mansion. </p> <p>But a high-ranking state law enforcement official said today that the men, who remain in custody in Minnesota and stand accused of manufacturing Molotov cocktails for use at last week's convention, are under investigation in Texas.</p> <p>Texas officials have video surveillance of a young man lighting a Molotov cocktail and using it to set the governor's mansion on fire. </p> <p>The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because the probe is on-going, said there were \"enough similar characteristics in the two cases to justify a review\".</p> <p>Minnesota attorney Jeff Degree said he hasn't heard of any Texas investigators meeting with McKay, his client, and that they haven't spoken about the governor's mansion case. When asked whether McKay admitted to producing Molotov cocktails for the Republican convention, Degree declined to answer.</p> <p>\"It's early on in the case and we haven't been able to review a lot of it,\" he said. \"It seems pretty clear, however, that law enforcement undertook a lot of pretty aggressive actions (during the convention), not just on the street but undercover informants.\"</p> <p>McKay and Crowder, who investigators say are connected to an Austin-based anarchist organisation called the Affinity Group, were charged in US federal court in Minnesota last week with illegally possessing Molotov cocktails.</p> <p>According to a federal affidavit, the FBI in Texas began investigating the group in February 2007, and group members left Texas last month for the convention site. </p> <p>Investigators allege that McKay and Crowder stopped at a Wal-Mart in St Paul to purchase Molotov cocktail supplies, which they stored at a local residence.</p> <p>On an FBI audio recording taped by an informant, McKay allegedly discusses plans to throw the explosive devices at vehicles in a parking lot used by law enforcement vehicles. During the same conversation, McKay is heard saying it was \"worth it if an officer gets burned or maimed\", authorities allege.</p> <p>When St Paul police raided the residence on September 3, officers seized gas masks, slingshots, helmets, and containers of a gasoline and oil mixture. They found eight assembled Molotov cocktails.</p> <p>McKay was arrested in that raid. Crowder, whose attorney and family members could not be reached, had been arrested two days earlier for disorderly conduct.</p> <p>Crowder's MySpace page where he uses the screen name Thoughtrebel, includes pictures of himself, one of which shows him crouching in front of three men carrying what appear to be Molotov cocktails. His page says he is a member of the Anarchist Collective and Anarchy in the USA groups.</p> <p>On McKay's web page, which is titled Go Away, he posts pictures of himself protesting and getting arrested by the Midland county, Texas, sheriff's department. </p> <p>His most recent log-in was on August 27, four days before the Republican National Convention.</p> <p>The men will remain in custody in Minnesota until that state's investigation is complete, said David Anderson, a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office.</p>",

Critical reception has been lukewarm, with mutterings that this is a high concept too far. <br><br>This is, of course, complete tosh. Lost In Austen, rather than being viewed as a half-hearted attempt to combine two disparate genres in one easily digestible package, should instead be heralded as the trailblazer in what I sincerely hope is going to be an entirely new television genre, the meta-literary adaptation. With such a wealth of potential out there, the possibility for taking previously unthought-of approaches to great literature is endless. Here are a few suggestions for what may well be hitting a screen near you soon: </p> <p>\"Hangover, Squared.\" Barmaid Sylvia has been on a big night out with her girlfriends when, stumbling out of a Soho bar after one too many tequila shots, she falls, bumps her head and passes out. When she wakes up again, she has travelled back in time to Patrick Hamilton's milieu, a grim, grimy Fitzrovia full of disappointment, rejected love and heartbreak. Shrugging her shoulders, she gets a job at a nearby pub, <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21437\">The Midnight Bell</a>, where she sets about spicing up the old-school atmosphere with two-for-one shots, all-night happy hours and manages to impress the dashing young barman, Bob, with an impressive display of cocktail flaring.</p> <p>\"Five Make A New Friend.\" Fresh from a Daily Mail headline, Spence has some serious problems with authority. He's from a broken home \u2013 father's a crack addict, mother died when he was five \u2013 and he's enough Asbos to fill several series of The Bill. What could be more natural for this connoisseur of shorties and blunts than to find himself transported to the happy land of Enid Blyton? Admittedly at first Julian, Anne, Dick, George and Timmy the dog are a bit surprised at Spence's repeated offers to \"slip a shiv into them\", and there's a minor contretemps when the kindly local policeman finds Spence's stash of class-A narcotics concealed in the Five's knapsack, but it's all sorted before tea, when the gang all get cheerfully high on PCP-laced ginger beer. </p> <p>\"Flashman's Schooldays.\" In the tough, inner-city comprehensive Rugby Heights, the teachers are less educators, more warriors. The pupils are out of control. Riots are more common than maths tests. Something has to be done. Step in a temporally displaced Flashman, fresh from subduing Tom Brown and his ilk. He may have been expelled from Rugby for being \"beastly drunk\", but he soon finds himself amongst friends here. With a merry cry of \"We're not having any of this balderdash, lads!\", Old Flashy soon finds himself the leader of a successful attempt to take over the school, seducing the head girl as he does so and re-introducing compulsory blanket-tossing for all pupils under the age of 13.</p> <p>If any of these came to pass, or similar \u2013 I quite like the idea of a Kafka-inflected sitcom as well, something along the lines of \"My Family, My Trial\" perhaps \u2013 then we should be deeply grateful to Lost In Austen for showing that, sometimes, high concept can lead to artistic brilliance.</p>",
  "<p>The US still faces a long struggle in Iraq and recent security gains are not irreversible, the outgoing commander of the country's troops in Iraq warned today.</p> <p>General David Petraeus delivered his sombre assessment in an interview with the BBC as he prepared to hand over his command to General Ray Odierno, his former number two in Iraq.</p> <p>Petraeus has been credited with pulling Iraq back from the brink during his 18 months in charge of US operations. Sectarian violence has dropped sharply and US casualties are down. US troops are now suffering more casualties in Afghanistan than in Iraq.</p> <p>Petraeus adopted a cautious tone in his interview with BBC's Newsnight, saying he did not know that he would ever use the word \"victory\".</p> <p>\"This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade,\" he said. \"It's not war with a simple slogan.\"</p> <p>As he prepares to assume charge of the US central command, which has responsibility for an area stretching from the Middle East to Pakistan, Petraeus said there were \"many storm clouds on the horizon which could develop into real problems\".</p> <p>US military commanders in Iraq are worried that violence could flare up during provincial elections, which were originally scheduled for this month but were postponed after the Iraqi parliament failed to agree on a new electoral law.</p> <p>Iraq's parliament must pass the law by the end of this month if elections are to take place this year. The law has been held up partly by disagreements among ethnic Kurds and other minorities about the unresolved status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. </p> <p>There is concern over a renewed Sunni-Shia schism as the Shia-dominated government moves to assert control over the Sunni volunteers who have successfully battled al-Qaida.</p> <p>These 100,000 or so Sunni fighters have been paid by the US, but Nouri al-Maliki's government has said it would take over payment and find them jobs. There is renewed tension between Sunnis and Shias following the recent arrest of several Sunni leaders.</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, announced the withdrawal of 8,000 troops from Iraq this week, a pace in the reduction in combat troops that was both slower and smaller than anticipated.</p> <p>US commanders see little alternative to keeping a big troop presence \u2013 about 140,000 soldiers - in Iraq for now because the situation remains fragile.</p> <p>Baghdad, however, has made it clear in current talks on a security pact that it would like all US combat forces to leave by 2011.</p>",
  "<p><br>Mercury-nominated Portico Quartet on the South Bank, where they used to busk. Photograph: Martin Argles</p> <p>Many cheers to <a href=\"www.babellabel.co.uk/Vortex%20artists%\">Portico Quartet</a> for their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/18/jazz.mercuryprize\">nomination to the shortlist</a> of this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mercuryprize\">Mercury prize</a>. They didn't get anywhere near winning, of course (the jazz acts never do, but if people stopped calling interesting bands of any genre \"acts\" it might be a big step in the right direction) but when The Times reported sales of their album Knee Deep In The North Sea being <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/ \">up 256% after they were shortlisted</a>, the real PR value of this kind of exposure comes home to roost.</p> <p>Within that simple statistic and the phenomenon that triggered it, lies the jazz dilemma. Most people know very little about the music, because information about it rarely enters the mainstream - so the simplest thing for potential audiences to do is buy the knee-jerk summary, which is that jazz is either impossibly weird or impossibly old. Jazz is hardly ever on TV, unless the subject is a legendary and probably long-departed artist - like the much-repeated, and perfectly honourable, documentary on singing star Ella Fitzgerald made last year, to which it should be said this writer was a happy contributor. When it's on the radio, it's either so wall-to-wall \"smooth\" as to be almost unlistenable (and in a way, as background music, designed to be) or it's in a variety of specialist slots on Radio 2 or 3 that people don't come across unless they know what they're looking for. But when a jazz or jazz-influenced band jumps the barriers - so listeners don't know any more whether they're supposed to be a jazz audience or not - then the appeal of this inquisitive and audacious form of music-making (and that's what it is, not a genre) bursts through.</p> <p>One of the most compelling examples in recent years has been The Bad Plus, the piano trio that won itself that rarest of jazz welcomes nowadays - the major-label record deal - for exposing classic pop hits to the merciless scrutiny of technically startling and conceptually revelatory free-improvisation. In 2006, for a <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jun/23/ \">Guardian Film &amp; Music feature</a> I talked to Bad Plus pianist Ethan Iverson about the temptations and dangers of much the same kind of temporary exposure Portico Quartet are getting now. \"Sales like ours are marginal to big companies,\" Iverson said. \"Whatever the Bad Plus have sold, I'm sure it didn't pay for coffee in that huge building Sony has on 56th and Madison.\" The Bad Plus lost its big record deal pretty fast, once the industry reminded itself, as it periodically does, that the gap between pop sales and exceptional jazz sales is still too wide for the average accounts department. If Portico Quartet get the same break, the same outcome will follow, it's just a question of when.</p> <p>Portico Quartet reflect on their place in the current jazz scheme of things in this <a href=\"www.babellabel.co.uk/images/Portico%20Post%20Jazz003.pdf\">JazzUK conversation</a>. And if you want to hear just why The Bad Plus tempts the industry with catchy hooks, then exhilaratingly subverts the implications with its improvising energies, don't miss them tomorrow (Friday) at London's <a href=\"www.cafelacreme.com/\">Cafe De Paris</a> on a last-minute promotional show for their upcoming album For All I Care.</p>",
  "<p>Seven years after al-Qaida terrorists destroyed the twin towers in New York, the US is stepping up its hunt for the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, and his followers. But the new strategy, involving special forces ground operations and increased aerial attacks inside Pakistan, risks turning the Afghan war into a regional conflict and destroying America's \"war on terror\" alliance with Pakistan's weak new civilian government.</p> <p>Reports in Washington today, not challenged by the White House, said President George Bush had secretly issued orders in July authorising US commanders to send forces into Pakistan to attack al-Qaida and Taliban bases there. Last week saw the first bitter fruits of this new approach: a raid by two dozen navy Seals commandos, supported by attack helicopters, that the US claims killed a large number of militants.</p> <p>Pakistani officials said most of the dead were civilians and furiously condemned the raid as an illegal affront to national sovereignty. But on Monday <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-35333120080905\">the US launched</a> another aerial attack in north Waziristan using an unmanned Predator drone. The number of Hellfire missile strikes by Predators has tripled this year.</p> <p>Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs, and Robert Gates, defence secretary, <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jgKOfMN6aPqJ2gMjeUiUL_tFkTlA\">told Congress this week</a> that victory in Afghanistan was by no means certain and the US needed to take the fight to the enemy inside Pakistan. Both men attributed this year's rising level of coalition and civilian casualties in Afghanistan to the infiltration of insurgents and weapons from so-called safe havens on Pakistani territory.</p> <p>Mullen called for a \"more comprehensive strategy\" embracing both sides of the border. \"Until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate, the enemy will only keep coming,\" he said. This was slightly disingenuous on his part, since Pakistan is adamant it does not want the US on its soil. Gordon Brown <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5irR0CyvGwHAlLs6zMhaHkykHi8CAD934FOUG0\">today appeared</a> to back the new US strategy. </p> <p>The political and military risks involved in widening the Afghan war to include western Pakistan were underscored this week by the armed forces chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. He said Pakistan would defend its sovereignty \"at all costs\" and called last week's commando raid \"reckless\". Kayani continued: \"No external force is allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan\u2026 There is no question of any agreement or understanding with the coalition forces whereby they are allowed to conduct operations on our side of the border.\"</p> <p>Kayani's tough words were seen in Pakistan as a shot across the bows of the country's ostensibly pro-American president, Asif Ali Zardari, who replaced the army's champion, former general Pervez Musharraf. They also raised the spectre of potential clashes between US and Pakistani forces if more unauthorised American incursions take place.</p> <p>Overall US policy is unlikely to change under Barack Obama or John McCain. Both presidential candidates support sending additional troops to Afghanistan; indeed, Obama attacked Bush this week for not sending more soldiers sooner. The Democrat has also advocated using American military might to bring Pakistan's tribal belt under control.</p> <p>But for Bush personally, while he remains in charge, another motive may have helped trigger this high-stakes gamble: his desire to catch or kill Bin Laden. The al-Qaida leader and his number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be in the tribal areas, routinely wearing disguises, avoiding all forms of detectable electronic communication, and protected by a personal bodyguard of fanatically loyal Saudis. </p> <p>Although Bush has stopped theatrically demanding Bin Laden be brought to him \"dead or alive\", he would dearly like to banish his nemesis before his presidency ends.</p> <p>According to Ted Gistaro, Bush's top al-Qaida intelligence expert, Bin Laden no longer handles day-to-day operations. But he remains the organisation's \"authoritative source for strategic and tactical guidance \u2026 Subordinates continue to see him as the group's most inspirational force\".</p> <p>Speaking in Washington last month, Gistaro said counter-terrorism efforts since 9/11 had \"constrained the ability of al-Qaida to attack the US and its allies\". But he warned that \"al-Qaida remains the most serious terrorist threat to the US\" and its \"intent to attack the US homeland remains undiminished\". In particular, it was stepping up propaganda efforts in the hope of encouraging \"self-generating cells\" of radical sympathisers inside the US itself.</p> <p>Yet for all their efforts to close in on their prey, American officials admit they still have no firm idea where Bin Laden is \u2013 and lack informers in the Pashtun areas where hostility to the US has increased along with the fighting. It's possible he is not in western Pakistan at all. And if they do find him, it may owe more to luck than judgment. Meanwhile, seven years after the \"war on terror\" was launched, US actions in Pakistan, coupled with those of its multiplying adversaries and reluctant allies, are coming dangerously close to igniting yet another war.</p>",
  "<p>The clear and sunny blue skies of September 11 2001 are on the verge of joining \"It was a dark and stormy night\" as a clich\u00e9. But it was true, and most mornings of the 10 days since I had moved into downtown Manhattan by South Street Seaport, I rode my bicycle briskly round through Battery Park and up the newly-opened cycle path along the West Side Highway. I would normally have been speeding past the World Trade Centre about the time the first plane hit.</p> <p>That morning, however, I was on deadline to write about the impending downfall of the US dollar. I had just typed a prophetic \"The\" when I heard the bang. I looked out my window, assuming one of the decrepit old buildings in the neighbourhood had just lost its battle with gravity, but the porters in the fish market in the square below were <a href=\"http://hereisnewyork.org/\">staring</a> up open-mouthed, looking like gawkers at the alien ship in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075860/\">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>. They were staring at the exit wound in the tower, billowing black smoke.</p> <p>The phone started ringing, and I was stuck on my fire escape talking to radio stations, since all mobile phones were out. On the streets crowds of refugees - covered in soot, dishevelled - filed along South St toward the Brooklyn Bridge, where their silhouettes made it look like an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Lowry\">LS Lowry</a> set design for a Potemkin film.</p> <p>Once the crowds had gone and the phones had stopped ringing, I headed toward the Twin Towers with recorder and notebook in hand. The police manned roadblocks around the site, but I suspected, correctly, that they would not have closed the footpath along Hudson. Trudging through the ashes around the site drifting like fallout brought the revelation that some proportion of that ash was people, leading to even deeper appreciation of the Downtown Hospital staff who had been handing out face masks. Retrospectively, the discovery that there was much more asbestos than human ash made using them seem even better.</p> <p>Round by South Cove, the firefighters had levered open a convenience store as a supply depot near where their trails of hoses drew water from the Hudson. They were going in for bottles of water and snacks before returning to the site. The road was a surrealist vision of hell. Trucks and cars scattered like a kid's toys, and over all, like thick snow, the drifting ash.</p> <p>I was interviewing the dazed and exhausted firemen, letting them use my cell phone to call and reassure their families since it was getting a signal from across in New Jersey when one came out, a bottle of water in one hand and a banana in the other. As he wolfed it down, he looked around, puzzled. \"I was looking for a garbage can,\" he explained as he surveyed the ruins and - in a gesture epitomising the new rules - hurled his banana skin into the piled-up fall out.</p> <p>As soon as our lease was up, a year later, we left. The memories, of the processions of refugees, the military convoys that arrived overnight down the FDR Drive, the ashes and the pervasive stench of the gates of hell as the Towers <a href=\"http://www.phaidon.com/aftermath/\">burnt for months afterwards</a>, all lingered.</p> <p>Today, downtown Manhattan seems to be booming. The fish market has closed, taking away much of the local colour \u2013 and a pervasive cloacal smell and all-night racket. People have moved in, and brought life to an area that used to close down at five \u2013 except for the fish.</p> <p>It also brings a smile that the foreshore in front of the old hotel/brothel that our apartment was in was reclaimed with the blitzed rubble of my hometown Liverpool, brought over as ballast on the Atlantic convoys. But there's little else to smile about. When I wondered through Wall Street recently, I could still see the crowds fleeing, smell the acrid smoke of the world's longest-lasting funeral pyre, and when I looked at George Washington's statue outside <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/feha/\">Federal Hall</a>, I could still see him, in my mind's eye, with a layer of white ash on his wig.</p> <p>They have only <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122100941916217671.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">just begun filling the hole</a> where the Towers were \u2013 and they still have not found Osama bin Laden. I don't have to go into a fugue to see that seven years later, the world is pretty much debris-strewn since the current George W in the White House threw out the constitution, international law and pretty much everything else \u2013 and it's clear that their social instincts never really minded littering on a global scale anyway.</p>",
  "<p>Computer games in which players aim to kill as many people as possible are, sadly, pretty common. But what sets \"Muslim Massacre - the game of modern religious genocide\" - apart from the others is that an American soldier sets out to \"wipe out\" the entire Muslim race. Worse still, the game is available free on the internet, with no restrictions to prevent children and the vulnerable from accessing it.</p> <p>The world wide web is one area that the law still struggles to regulate.</p> <p>Some may see the game as a parody of American foreign policy and point out that it is aimed at adults, rather than children. After all, the average US video game player is a 35-year-old man.</p> <p>But the game reaches a new low in bad taste and contains a blatantly destructive message. The game's premise is that the US has declared war on Islam and invites players to take control of the American \"hero\" who will wipe out the Muslim race with \"an arsenal of the world's most destructive weapons\". </p> <p>The \"hero\" uses machine guns and rocket launchers to kill as many Muslims as possible - ranging from terrorists and what appear to be civilians to Osama bin Laden, Muhammad and Allah. </p> <p>The game's creator, a freelance programmer called Sigvatr, describes the game as \"fun and funny\" and <a href=\"http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2884255\">says to his critics:</a> \"Don't whinge about how offensive and 'edgy' this is.\"</p> <p>He says: \"Ultimately it's just a game where you blow the gently caress (slang for a common swear word) out of Arabs\u2026I don't even know how to interpret it myself anymore. The bottom line is that I enjoyed making it and it's fun to play.\"</p> <p>Later he adds: \"The Muslims represented in the game aren't meant to be based on actual Muslims.</p> <p>\"If I was to try and come up with a meaning for the game at this moment, it would probably be something along the lines of metaphorically destroying the stereotypical depiction of a Muslim.\"</p> <p>That's not the way some Muslim groups see it. The <a href=\"http://www.ramadhanfoundation.com/muslimmassacre.htm\">Ramadhan Foundation says</a> the game is \"unacceptable, tasteless and deeply offensive\". </p> <p>The group argues: \"This game is glorifying the killing of Muslims in the Middle East and we urge ISP providers to take action to remove this site from their services as it incites violence towards Muslims and is trying to justify the killing of innocent Muslims.\"</p> <p>As well as appealing to the game's creator to take it down, The Ramadhan Foundation has also asked the government to take action. </p> <p>But, it seems, there is little the authorities can do about it. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbfc.co.uk/\">British Board of Film Classification</a> (BBFC) puts age stamps on films and DVDs and, in rare cases, bans them \u2013 but says it has no legal control over the internet. It needs a physical product it can put a sticker on. </p> <p>If a game producer is based in the UK, there may be some scope for intervention under obscenity or race hatred legislation, according to the BBFC, but there is little the authorities can do if \u2013 as it appears in this case \u2013 a game is produced outside the UK.</p> <p>The BBFC, the games industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are all supporting a new system of voluntary regulation, whereby producers can submit their internet games to the BBFC for an official age rating. The likes of Sigvatr are hardly likely to do that.<br> It's a tough one \u2013 how to encourage a vibrant internet culture while protecting adults and children from offensive material?</p> <p>Is Muslim Massacre the kind of game that supports the case for greater regulation of the internet? Or is it just a harmless, if tasteless parody, that shows the internet should be left to its own devices?</p>",
  "<p>South Ossetia does not want to become part of Russia, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said today, following a series of contradictory statements from Eduard Kokoity, the South Ossetian leader.</p> <p>Kokoity was initially quoted by news agencies as telling a group of foreign policy experts that Georgia's breakaway province would join Russia.

But South Ossetia is not going to become part of Russia, it intends to build intergovernmental relations with international law with all states,\" Kokoity told Interfax.</p> <p>South Ossetia broke with Georgia after a war in the early 1990s and relies heavily on Russia.

  "<p>Never mind how many goals he might score for England, if there's a footballer you would trust to leave your kids/wife/mother-in-law/boss or dog with, it's Theo Walcott. Particularly dogs - if anyone's having trouble with one of those small yappy breeds, Walcott has a neat trick of soothing them to sleep curled up on his neck. While he's doing that he'll probably multi-task to fetch you a cup of tea. </p> <p>While Walcott's heroics in Zagreb have us falling back in love with England all over again, many are already wondering if the inevitable hero-worshipping of the 19-year-old will change the polite young man. Those who wonder might like to cast their minds back to the media frenzy that has already been. The \u00a310m move to Arsenal from Southampton aged 16, the shock senior England call-up, the Baden Baden stalking of his teenage girlfriend Melanie Slade quickly branded a Wag, the celebrity TV appearances of Walcott and his family. When Walcott and Slade graced the cover of Hello! magazine many inwardly groaned that this would be the beginning of the end, a sweet young couple ruined by fame and fortune. Instead it never happened. Slade continued her education and this month started a university course in physiology, while Walcott is as mild-mannered, polite and articulate as he ever was. The only difference now is that he's also a better footballer. </p> <p>He's also refreshingly free of footballer's ego (an endemic and highly contagious disease). How many footballers would buy their girlfriend a better car than their own? While Mel whizzes about in a slinky Merc, Walcott still self-identifies with a very modest VW golf. \"It's small and zippy. It reminds me of myself,\" he says. It is an unusual philosophy in a sport where the training ground car park is another competitive extension of the football pitch. But Walcott doesn't seem to have that 'wannabe big bollocks' drive. He is happy being a prodigiously talented footballer, working on improving his skills. It is enough. He does not drink, he does not cheat on his girlfriend, he does not need anger management therapy, he is just nice, and human. </p> <p>Actually scratch 'nice' - nice too often means 'boring' and Walcott is far from that. He enjoys a pointed one-liner, one eyebrow slightly raised, a bit of a smirk at his own joke. He doesn't need to shirk questions in interviews because, I suspect, it is important to him to tell the truth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/20/arsenal.premierleague\">When we met at his house eight weeks ago</a> I asked about Cristiano Ronaldo's 'slavery' comments. No self-respecting human being could ever agree with those. And yet most footballers would rather have a quiet life than have a go at a colleague. Walcott, though, would rather take the human option and express what everyone else is thinking. And he did so, with a wry smile, a reverent footnote about what a great player Ronaldo is, and a great deal of dignity.</p> <p>So bring on the 'Trio Walcott' headlines, the 'Wald Cup', the euphoric vocabulary of 'sensational', 'stunning' and 'super'. Walcott can handle it and all the celebrity shenanigans that go with it. Because after the party is over, just like after Zagreb, he will go back to his family home, sit in his kitchen and get excited about milkshakes, T-shirts, art sets and dog whisperers.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Richard Dawkins recently said that most Muslims were <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1041089/Atheist-Richard-Dawkins-blames-Muslims-importing-creationism-classrooms.html\">creationists</a>, and their children are taught that the theory of evolution is wrong, which causes a huge problem in schools. </p> <p>He's largely correct, and the Muslim world desperately needs to debate the matter properly without fear, since science can neither prove nor disprove God. Whereas the Christian world, where Charles Darwin first proposed his thesis, has had a century and a half to come to terms with the theory of evolution, it has only begun to be taught rather recently in the Muslim world, where faith and religious practice is still relatively strong. </p> <p>No wonder then that the theory is opposed by some religious elements, especially those that are ignorant of science. Snazzy websites, videos and books produced by fundamentalist Muslim \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/01/evolution.islam\">creationists</a>\" such as those at <a href=\"http://www.harunyahya.com\">www.harunyahya.com</a>, are obscuring clear scientific thinking.</p> <p>Creation or evolution? Many believers in God have no problem with an obvious solution: that God created man via evolution. Here is some explanation of this view from a Muslim perspective.<br>I have a background in physical sciences, not biological ones, but there are parallels. Just as we can see clear evidence for the fact that planets, stars and galaxies evolved very gradually over the last 13 billion years since the big bang and weren't just beamed into existence by God, it would seem intuitive that life in its breathtaking variety on Earth also arose through a gradual evolutionary processes. There are plenty of Muslim biologists who have no doubt about the essential correctness of evolutionary theory.</p> <p>The Qur'an teaches that humanity began with Adam, whose wife Eve was made \"of like nature\". The raw materials from which Adam was created are variously described as dust, clay and water, ie a mixture of water and minerals found on earth and in its soil. God completed the creation of Adam, breathed his spirit into him and taught him the names of everything. Since the angels were ignorant of these names, he commanded them to bow down to Adam, to symbolise human superiority over angels due to our free will, intelligence, capacity to understand and express ourselves in eloquent language.</p> <p>One problem is that many Muslims retain the simple picture that God created Adam from clay, much as a potter makes a statue, and then breathed into the lifeless statue and lo! it became a living human. This is a children's madrasa-level understanding and Muslims really have to move on as adults and intellectuals, especially given the very serious <a href=\"http://www.muslimheritage.com\">scientific heritage</a> of the medieval Islamic civilisation.</p> <p>Another objection that is sometimes posed is the following: doesn't evolution denigrate and insult all humans, but especially the prophets of God, by insisting that we all originate from apes? I reply that the theory doesn't insult anyone, but does remind us of the humble origins of our created form. This is nothing new or blasphemous, since numerous Qur'anic verses remind us that we are all created from \"dust\" via sexual discharges: \"despised drops of water\". Those verses clearly do not insult the prophets. Meanwhile, our spiritual form remains the most exalted, since it is from the spirit of God breathed into Adam: we exist for the most noble purpose of knowing and loving God, freely and after having been given a choice.</p> <p>Another irony in this whole debate is that several medieval Islamic thinkers had ideas that were broadly similar to the theory of evolution. The 10th-century Persian philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Miskawayh\">Ibn Miskawayh</a> may have had ideas about the natural world that were, broadly speaking, evolutionist. The 14th-century philosopher <a href=\"http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm\">Ibn Khaldun</a> wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>One should then look at the world of creation. It started out from the minerals and progressed, in an ingenious, gradual manner, to plants and animals.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although Ibn Khaldun wasn't speaking directly about evolution in the modern sense, I don't think he would have had a major problem with Darwin's theory, judging from the passage above. But it is precisely the loss of the heritage of people like Ibn Khaldun that has led to the current, appalling state of science in the Muslim world and the Muslim consciousness.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, today accepted responsibility for Labour's continuing poor performance in the opinion polls.</p> <p>But he also laid some of the blame on the global economy.</p> <p>\"I am explaining to you that if you go around the world, you will see that every country is affected,\" he said.</p> <p>The reason such comments provoke scepticism is because Brown's mantra during his 10 years at the Treasury was that his prudence as chancellor of the exchequer would ensure there would never be a return to \"boom and bust\" economics.</p> <p>Year after year, the message was the same:</p> <p><strong>May 20, 1997, speech by the chancellor to the CBI: Exploiting the British genius \u2013 the key to long-term economic success: </strong><br> \"Stability is necessary for our future economic success. The British economy of the future must be built not on the shifting sands of boom and bust, but on the bedrock of prudent and wise economic management for the long term. It is only these firm foundations that we can raise Britain's underlying economic performance.\"</p> <p><strong>April 28 1998, speech by the chancellor to the British American business council in London:</strong><br>\"Now it is true to say in Britain that the last forty years has been characterised by stop go, boom bust, instability in economic policy. And so I can tell you that the first objective of the new government has been the determination to ensure monetary and fiscal stability, in place of stop go, and to do so in an economy far more open than the sheltered national economics of the past.\"</p> <p><strong>June 10 1999, speech by the chancellor at Mansion House:</strong> <br>\"The way forward is for governments to consciously pursue monetary and fiscal stability through setting clear objectives, establishing proper rules, and requiring openness and transparency - the new rules of the game. Particularly important for a Britain which has been more subject than most economies to the instability of boom-bust cycles and constantly changing policies.</p> <p>Indeed, the economy of 1997 was set to repeat the same cycle of boom and bust that had been seen over the past 20 years. There were strong inflationary pressures in the system. Consumer spending was growing at an unsustainable rate and inflation was set to rise sharply above target; there was a large structural deficit on the public finances. Public sector net borrowing stood at \u00a328 billion.</p> <p>So we put in place a wholly new long term framework of monetary and fiscal policy based on:</p> <p>* first, clear objectives: price stability through a pre-announced inflation target - a symmetrical target - and sustainable public finances through tough fiscal rules: the golden rule that requires that over the cycle we balance the current budget, and the sustainable investment rule requires that, as we borrow for investment, debt is held to a prudent and stable level;</p> <p>* second, well understood rules: a new system of monetary policy-making, at the heart of which is the independence of the Bank of England, and its open letter system, and an equivalent and equally important set of fiscal procedures legally enshrined in the code for fiscal stability; and</p> <p>* third, transparency in policy-making: an open system of decision-making in monetary policy through the publication of minutes, a system of voting and full reporting to parliament; and in fiscal policy the same openness and disclosure with key fiscal assumptions independently audited.\"</p> <p><strong>April 5 2000, Speech by Gordon Brown to the British Chamber of Commerce national conference:</strong><br>\"In a global marketplace with its increased insecurities and indeed often volatility and instability national economic stability is at a premium, the precondition for all we can achieve, and no nation can secure the high levels of sustainable investment it needs without both monetary and fiscal stability together.</p> <p>And it was to avoid the historic British problem - the violence of the repeated boom and bust cycles of the past - that we established the new monetary framework based on consistent rules - the symmetrical inflation target; settled well understood procedures - Bank independence; and openness and transparency. And side by side with it and as important, a new fiscal discipline with, again, clear and consistent rules - the golden rule for public spending; well understood procedures - our fiscal responsibility legislation; and a new openness and transparency\u2026</p> <p>My vision is of a Britain where there is not stop go and boom bust but economic stability; a Britain which is business-friendly, and where there is enterprise, opportunity for all; a Britain which rewards the innovator and risk-taker and encourages a new generation of entrepreneurs, a Britain which because opportunity is open to all is enterprising and fair.\"</p> <p><strong>June 20 2001, chancellor's speech at Mansion House</strong><br>\"Every time in recent decades when the British economy has started to grow, Governments of both parties have taken short-term decisions which too often have created unsustainable consumer booms, let the economy get out of control and sacrificed monetary and fiscal prudence. And everyone here will remember how quickly and easily boom turned to bust in the early nineties.</p> <p>So Britain did need a wholly new monetary and fiscal framework that went beyond the crude Keynesian fine tuning of the fifties and sixties and the crude monetarism of the seventies and eighties and, instead, offered a modern British route to stability.\"</p> <p><strong>March 28 2002, speech to the TGWU conference, Manufacturing matters</strong><br>\"With Bank of England independence, tough decisions on inflation, new fiscal rules, and hard public spending controls, we today in our country have economic stability not boom and bust, the lowest inflation in Europe, and long term interest rates - essential for businesses planning to borrow and invest - lower than for thirty five years.</p> <p>So while many have claimed Britain was worst placed of any to withstand the global slowdown, the OECD and IMF have both shown that Britain last year had the highest growth of any of the G7 countries.</p> <p>So nothing we do will put at risk the fundamental stability on which manufacturing depends.</p> <p>There will be no return to the short-term lurches in policy that would put long-term stability at risk.</p> <p>No relaxing our fiscal disciplines as some would like.\"</p> <p><strong>November 18, 2003, speech to the CBI national conference</strong><br>\"But, for the first time in fifty years, Britain has not only avoided recession but has continued to grow in quarter after quarter, year after year, in all six years of our government since 1997.</p> <p>Remember the old days, what was called the British problem: stop go, boom bust, unstable cycles\u2026Britain the country usually first in, worst hit and last out of any world downturn; invariably hit by an inflation problem that prevented interest rates falling when they needed to come down; and usually then by wage inflation that could not be afforded and prevented you making long term investment.</p> <p>So I want to explain to you today the policy we - and the Bank of England - will continue to pursue to ensure the British economy entrenches our new won and hard won stability and continues to grow \u2013 ensuring we take no risks with inflation or stability generally, or with the fiscal position.\"</p> <p><strong>April 21 2004, remarks at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference:</strong><br>\"Now, by working together, we can see a Britain that has a new found and hard won stability with: the lowest inflation for thirty years; and the lowest interest rates for forty years; the lowest unemployment for a generation; and a Britain that is seen today as the most stable of all the major economies.</p> <p>And it is important we understand how and why it is Britain \u2013 once the most stop go of economies - which has avoided the recessions that hit America, Germany, Japan, Italy and most other industrial economies during the world downturn of the last few years and has enjoyed sustained and sustainable growth.</p> <p>So let me just explain the long term difficult decisions that had to be made and what I know we must also do to entrench that stability for the future.\"</p> <p><strong>September 13 2005, speech the Trades Union Congress annual conference</strong><br>\"And I also tell you straight \u2013 in the face of that global challenge from which there is no hiding place, no safe haven other than equipping ourselves better for our future \u2013 if we are to succeed there must be no return to the fiscal irresponsibility, the economic short termism, the inflationary pay deals and the old conflicts and disorder of the past; there can be no retreat from demanding efficiency and value for money as well as equity as we renew and reform public services; there is no future for a global trading nation like ours in trying to erect protectionist barriers with the rest of the world. And just as we need stability in inflation and interest rates, we need stability in our industry policy, stability in industrial relations, and stability in our trading relationships with the rest of the world, and we build this stability for a purpose: for it is the one sure route to full employment for our generation and to prosperity for all.</p> <p>And at every time we must act to tackle the risks to stability and growth, risks that are today already reducing European growth rates to one per cent and raising European unemployment beyond twenty million, risks that now have risen from the doubling of world oil prices.\"</p> <p><strong>June 5 2006, speech the CBI president's dinner:</strong><br>\"Now, over the past few months I have been all over Britain and have seen British business succeeding in the global economy:</p> <p>* a few days ago I welcomed the new Airbus A380 with its Rolls Royce engines to Heathrow Airport - the largest commercial airliner ever built - and a symbol of Britain and Europe's modern manufacturing strength, and capacity to compete and win in the high tech industries of the future;</p> <p> * from Glasgow and Edinburgh, to Cardiff and Bristol, to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, I have visited city after city and seen each city thriving, growing, prospering - each one a demonstration of the vibrancy and dynamism of Britain's creative industries; <br>  * and all over the country I have met young men and women with ideas for their own businesses, showing the entrepreneurial flair that I believe has led one distinguished body to speak of a step change in Britain's enterprise culture and is a sign of Britain's enterprise success.</p> <p>These \u2013 and your success \u2013 convince me that despite all the challenges we face and how much more we know we have to do and continue to do to maintain our competitiveness, more than ever that Britain is well placed to be one of the great global success stories of this century.\"</p> <p><strong>May 5 2007, speech at the CBI annual dinner</strong><br>\"Exactly 10 years ago when I first spoke to you as Chancellor, the country had spent a whole era wrestling with inflation and volatility and quite frankly the havoc stop go visited on long term investment.</p> <p>Thinking back to my words to you then, I set out my pledge to make stability the central pillar of my economic and business policy.</p> <p>I was convinced that having the strength to take the long term decisions to ensure Britain's competitiveness meant developing a shared national purpose that economic stability came first.</p> <p>Now tonight I am here speaking to you ten years on to say that we need to forge that same shared national purpose for the years ahead, this time to meet and master the new and even more profound challenges ahead - mastering the pace of change and the relentless competition we face from every part of the world in every area of our economy, now affecting every area of your business.</p> <p>And building on our hard won stability, our mission now and for the years ahead is to make Britain the dynamic and competitive enterprise economy we all want it to be.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was definitely something strange in the air in Rio. Although Brazil seemed to have finally woken up in the South American 2010 World Cup Qualifiers by winning their first game away since 2004, scoring three goals against a Chile side that until then was four places above them in the table, tickets for the second game of the international week still waited for eventual punters in the ticket office of the Joao Havelange Stadium, the modern arena built for the 2007 Pan-American games. And only 29,000 out of the 45,000 available were on offer to the general public. It seemed that even the hated touts who turn up in numbers for every important football game in the city did not want to touch the match with a bargepole, even after a triumph against Chile that the national media was quick to hail as a demonstration of pride and power. </p> <p>In the end, what an omen it was: in front of empty stands, Brazil managed a meagre goalless draw against the Bolivians, whose qualification for the 1994 World Cup is every day a fuzzier memory, especially with their side lagging at the bottom of the table. Yesterday, however, they did put up a fight and could have surprised the hosts twice in the first half if Internazionale's goalkeeper Julio Cesar had not intervened. Shame for the Bolivians that their enthusiasm led to some strong challenges and resulted in the dismissal of Ignacio Garcia, even though TV replays showed that Robinho made a meal out of the dangerous tackle. Garcia didn't catch him, but the Manchester City man acted as if his leg had been cut off with a machete.</p> <p>So, Bolivia now had only 10 men and would surely struggle to keep the five-times world champions at bay, especially given their already shameful defensive record in the qualifiers (eight goals scored and 20 conceded in seven games). Yet they ended up managing to secure their second clean sheet in the tournament so far and the first since October 2007, which explains why the Bolivian players almost embarked on a lap of honour at the end of the game. They were even applauded towards the end by Brazilian supporters, who were taunting their troubled manager with chants of \"Goodbye Dunga\".</p> <p>To be fair to Dunga and his players, they almost breached the Bolivian defence a couple of times and should have had a penalty in the 87th minute, when Sevilla's striker Luis Fabiano was blatantly fouled in the penalty area. On the other hand, almost is not enough for Brazilians, even when one discounts the unwritten law that obligates anyone in yellow shirts to score hat tricks in every game. The faithful present last night made that clear early in the second half by booing Ronaldinho every time he touched the ball. He had already had a nightmare game against Chile, missing a penalty and being duly replaced by Dunga after left-back Kleber was sent off. The Milan player cut a desolate figure on the bench and needed a long talk with assistant manager Jorginho to recompose himself.</p> <p>Defeat against Chile would certainly have cost Dunga the job: the 1994 World Cup winner seems to be making more enemies everyday, especially with his refusal to accept that his side lack inspiration and organisation. He cannot seriously think that heart alone will beat opponents, particularly at a time when Argentina are not the only problem for Brazilians in the continent: after eight rounds, Paraguay are the top team in the South American tournament, with 17 points, four more than the Brazilians, who are in second. Argentina drew for the second match in a row yesterday (1-1 away to Peru) and now lie in fifth place, which would require them to go through the play-offs if they remain in that position.</p> <p>The Rio fiasco against Bolivia has certainly made the stay of execution achieved by Dunga in Santiago look quite feeble. The pressure is back on the former captain, who will now be having nightmares about the plank again if he doesn't run a tight ship next month in the games against Venezuela and Colombia. The problem is that another omen is in the air: it was Brazil's first-ever defeat to the Venezuelans in a friendly last July (which, by the way, led to the country's president, Hugo Chavez, ditching the protocol and openly teasing his Brazilian counterpart, Lula da Silva) that first sparked the calls for Dunga's head around newsrooms and, it is rumoured, in the offices of the Brazilian FA.</p> <p>Meanwhile, everyone just wants to see Kaka back in the squad as soon as possible. He is believed to be ready to play again for Milan this weekend after almost four months recovering from knee surgery. But having the current World No1 player is more than merely a morale boost for Brazil after Diego picked up a second yellow card against Bolivia and will be suspended for the Venezuela game. But there is some diplomacy required, since Kaka and Dunga have not seen eye to eye for a while, with the midfielder feeling unfairly treated by his manager after the Copa America episode, when he and Ronaldinho asked to be left out of the tournament to rest.</p> <p>The South American qualifiers are a long tournament, played in a league system in order to please every football association, who are each given a chance to host big games - something that didn't happen under the previous group format. And Brazil have been in the mire before, only clinching the 2002 World Cup spot in the last round. Though it is unlikely that they will dent their currently perfect record in terms of World Cup attendance, it's a worrying sign when the national media starts doing the maths: apparently, Brazil need to win at least half of the next available 30 points to book a place in South Africa. It does not sound like merely a humble pie feast. Fear, anyone?</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/08/makemychildamozartloverd\">The first few days</a> of our family trip to Salzburg had been a big success, and by now I was feeling pretty optimistic about my attempt to turn my kids onto Mozart. But as we got ready to go out for our first concert, disaster struck. Neither Edward (eight) nor Thea (four) wanted to leave the hotel. It had nothing to do with music. It was all to do with shoes. Edward didn't think his smart white shirt went with trainers. Thea didn't want to wear her party dress without high heels. I know it must sound trivial, but they were both really upset. I can remember feeling just the same way as a child.</p> <p>Eventually, I persuaded Edward that he'd look a lot more out of place if he went to the concert in his football kit (his favourite outfit for most occasions) and Thea agreed to come too so long as she could go barefoot. I told her I'd buy her some high heeled shoes en route if I could - not an outright lie, strictly speaking, since I knew all the shops were shut - and so we set off into town, with Thea on my shoulders and Edward following on foot.</p> <p>The venue for our concert could hardly have been more historic - St Peter's Stiftskeller, a labyrinthine cluster of salons where Mozart sometimes ate, and where some of his compositions were first played. Cut into the cliff face that towers over the medieval Altstadt, it claims to be <a href=\"http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/austria/salzburg/review-34937.html\">Europe's oldest restaurant</a>, and it's got the paperwork to prove it. A bill of fare for Emperor Charlemagne is displayed outside, dated 803AD. Tonight's event was <a href=\"www.mozartdinnerconcert.com\">a candlelit dinner</a>, with Mozart arias before every course, accompanied by a chamber orchestra, all kitted out in frock coats and powdered wigs. Of course the place was full of tourists - but what the hell, we were tourists too - and Thea loved the look of it, especially the pretty soprano in her satin bodice. She got a bit restless once the music started, and we had a few tricky moments, but after the first course she fell asleep. Some of the adult guests were more intrusive, taking flash photos of the performers, but they were far better behaved than most punters in Mozart's day, who often treated his masterworks as background muzak.</p> <p>Although it's purely for tourists, you can't fault the authenticity of this entertainment. Even the food was 18th century, according to my programme: cream soup with lemon and cinnamon; roast capon with pear and polenta, and parfait of honey \u2013 all popular dishes in Mozart's day, or so the menu said. But by far the biggest revelation was my son, Edward \u2013 he was gripped. It reminded me of the time I took him to his first football match, and it made me realise that high culture, just like sport, is only truly thrilling in the flesh. The time had gone so quickly. I couldn't believe tomorrow would be our last full day.</p>",
  "<p>The World Bank has quietly cancelled a \"model\" oil pipeline agreement with Chad after revenues meant to be spent on schools and hospitals were instead used to consolidate President Idriss Deby's grip on power.</p> <p>The innovative deal, signed in 2000, was supposed to ensure that the oil wealth in one of the world's poorest and most corrupt countries was not wasted. But this week the World Bank confirmed that it had pulled out of the project it had helped finance, after Chad agreed to repay a $140m (\u00a370m) loan ahead of schedule. </p> <p>In a statement, the World Bank said that Deby's government had failed to \"allocate adequate resources critical for poverty reduction\" as set out in the original agreement. </p> <p>\"Regrettably, it became evident that the arrangements that had underpinned the bank's involvement in the Chad/Cameroon pipeline project were not working. The bank therefore concluded that it could not continue to support this project under these circumstances,\" it said.</p> <p>The decision is deeply embarrassing for the World Bank. It had hoped that the experiment could serve as an example for other developing countries on how to ensure transparency and avoid the \"resource curse\", where the profits from a country's natural wealth are pocketed by the ruling elite. </p> <p>Despite warnings from civil society groups that Deby's regime was incapable of effectively managing a sudden inflow of petrodollars, the World Bank agreed to part-finance the construction of a 620-mile, $4.2bn pipeline linking landlocked Chad to terminals on Cameroon's Atlantic coast. Its support added crucial credibility to what was at the time the largest-ever private sector investment in sub-Saharan Africa - in one of the continent's most unstable countries. </p> <p>In return for the World Bank's blessing, Chad's government agreed to spend 72% of oil royalties, expected to reach $1.4bn this year, on building schools, hospitals and roads. A further 10% was to have been held back for future generations. The safeguards were considered crucial given that reserves are only expected to last 30 years; the oil bonanza is Chad's one chance at rapid development. </p> <p>But although an independent oversight commission was set up to monitor how the revenues were spent, it was prevented from properly doing its work once the oil began to flow in 2003. The anti-poverty spending targets never came close to being met. </p> <p>Deby repeatedly tried to have the revenue agreement renegotiated to allow the government to spend more oil money as it pleased. He won some concessions from the World Bank in 2006, and then sought to deflect domestic criticism of the lack of development by arguing that outsiders \"had imposed injustice on us\". Describing the government's share of the revenue from the 170,000 barrels a day as \"crumbs\", he temporarily expelled US company Chevron and Petronas, the Malaysian state-owned firm, which together with Exxon Mobil run most of the oil operations in Chad. </p> <p>Over the past year, as Deby's own future has looked increasingly insecure, with rebels attacking the capital, he has signed decrees giving him greater personal control over the country's finances. A significant chunk of the oil revenue is believed to have been spent on the military.</p>",
  "<p>At 78 years old, Christopher Plummer is in complete control of his craft. Currently starring in Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra at Canada's <a href=\"http://www.stratford-festival.on.ca/\">Stratford Shakespeare festival</a>, the Canadian acting legend has the audience in the palm of his hand from his casually commanding opening chat with the Sphinx: \"For I am he of whose genius you are the symbol: part brute, part woman and part god - nothing of man in me at all.\"</p> <p>Of course, there are some things a septuagenarian thespian can't do - jump out of the Pharos lighthouse to escape from the Egyptians at the end of Act III, for example. And so Caesar and Cleopatra's director Des McAnuff has intervened with a distraction. Just as Plummer's Caesar is about to make his leap a cannon booms across the stage from him; while the audience is looking the other way, a body double replaces Plummer for the jump.</p> <p>Plummer, who has appeared on and off at the Canadian Stratford since 1956, has returned the favour to McAnuff. His triumphant, booming Caesar and the possibility of a Broadway transfer has distracted critics from concerns about McAnuff's recent leap to the leadership of North America's largest classical repertory company.</p> <p>McAnuff, who has had great commercial success with productions like Jersey Boys and The Who's Tommy, took the reins two years ago from Richard Monette, who sadly passed away during this year's festival, at the age of 64. McAnuff was part of an artistic triumvirate including Don Shipley, former head of the Dublin theatre festival, and Marti Maraden, former head of Canada's National Arts Centre. This spring, however, just as their first season was about to launch, the trio fell apart for reasons that are still obscure; McAnuff was the last one standing.</p> <p>Concerns that McAnuff's sensibility was too flashy and - despite being born and bred in Canada - too American for the festival were exacerbated with his opening production of Romeo and Juliet. The show was hampered by a weak performance from a young musical actor he had imported from the States to play Juliet.</p> <p>Four months on, however, with the whole season up and running (the festival continues until November), Stratford and McAnuff are sitting pretty. In addition to Plummer's critically acclaimed Caesar, Tony-winning actor Brian Dennehy's double bill of Eugene O'Neill's Hughie and Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape was a sell-out hit that may be remounted in New York next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, two British directors visited and made a splash. Former RSC director Adrian Noble helmed a marvellous Hamlet starring an intense Canadian actor named Ben Carlson, a production also notable for Geraint Wyn Davies' sympathetic Polonius and Adrienne Gould's edgy Ophelia; and Lawrence Boswell imported his interest in the Spanish Golden Age, staging a well-received production of Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna.</p> <p>Also attracting applause was a production of Euripedes' The Trojan Women, featuring four astonishing performances from a quartet of the Stratford company's actresses: Martha Henry, Seana McKenna, Yanna McIntosh and Kelli Fox (yes, fellow Canuck Michael J's sister). Add in a deliciously frothy production of The Music Man with brilliant choreography by Michael Lichtefeld and you had a season that's been luring crowds to the small town of Stratford, Ontario, despite high petrol prices.</p> <p>Not that there haven't been misses. Simon Callow's one-man show about Shakespeare's sonnets was very under-rehearsed on opening night, while the two new Canadian plays were ambitious failures. Aside from the Hamlet, the Shakespeare productions - the original focus for the 55-year-old festival founded under Tyrone Guthrie - were disappointing.</p> <p>The question now is where McAnuff - who also has a busy career on Broadway, with a Guys and Dolls revival opening in the Spring - will take the festival next and whether he can keep the buzz up. For the time being, however, any concerns about any creative blockage in the pipes of this classical company have disappeared with Plummer's appearance.</p>",
  "<p>It takes a lot for 129 heads of universities and colleges to agree sufficiently on anything to sign a joint petition. As well expect cats in a sack to miaow the Hallelujah Chorus in close harmony. </p> <p>But that (the petititon, not the chorus) is what has happened in the US. Not only has this regiment of academic presidency affixed their signatures to a piece of paper, they have formed a lobby group called the Amethyst Initiative.<br><br>What, you may well ask, could unite all those rivalrous institutional leaders? In a word, beer. And why Amethyst? Not because they advocate getting stoned, but because the word, in its original Greek, means \"not intoxicated\". </p> <p>What these clever folk are asking - nay, in their diplomatic way, demanding - is that Congress amend the 1984 National Minimum Drinking Age Act. Currently the MDA stands at 21. The call from Amethyst is that it be lowered to 18.</p> <p>Britons, particularly undergraduate Britons, who go to the US are routinely amazed to be \"carded\" in restaurants, clubs, and bars and, if they can't prove legal drinking age, bluntly refused service. </p> <p>Those who serve, supply, or oversee the supply of alcohol in the US are vigilant. It's self-preservation, not morality. The law comes down on them like the proverbial ton of bricks if they trespass. </p> <p>My 20-year-old son helped an illegally aged girl friend carry a case of beer from a liquor store to the boot of her car. Just one case. And it was pure gallantry. Jack didn't touch the stuff himself - having been through AA at the age of 15. </p> <p>He was unaware that the liquor store in question was being staked out by local police. He was arrested, for facilitating the supply of alcohol to a minor. </p> <p>His girlfriend, who was Mexican-American, got bail and promptly high-tailed it over the border. Prison for Jack was possible, but unlikely. Loss of his driving licence (the equivalent for a Californian 20-year-old of hemiplegia) was certain, if convicted. It cost me $2K in attorney fees to get him off. </p> <p>The liquor store was less lucky. It was closed down. <br> <br>In the US, you can get a driving licence from as young as 14 (South Dakota), vote at 18, and buy a gun (in Virginia) at that same age. You can die for your country in Afghanistan while still a teen. But, if you abide by the law, you'll die sober.</p> <p>Why do so many college presidents want to open the beer spigot? You can read their <a href=\"http://www.amethystinitiative.org\">arguments</a>, elegantly expounded. They boil down to the following:</p> <p>1 Manifestly, college students do drink and, because it's illegal, they are that much more likely to binge. The psychology is familiar. Forbidden fruit encourages excess. </p> <p>2 Other kinds of on-campus excess are similarly encouraged. Go on the web and check out Coeds Gone Wild. Booze figures prominently. </p> <p>3 Prohibition doesn't work. It creates criminals. </p> <p>4 Colleges find themselves in an appallingly difficult position vis-a-vis their student accommodation, particularly where fraternities and sororities are involved. If they do nothing, they can be prosecuted as passive suppliers. If they actively interfere, or patrol, or raid fraternity fridges, they put themselves on a par with prison wardens. Not good.</p> <p>5 The 21-year-old regulation, passed in Reagan's second term, is the equivalent of Nancy's \"just say no\", or the religious right's advocacy of abstinence as the best contraceptive. It's downright primitive and, worse than that, it doesn't work (look at Bristol Palin's tummy, and Levi Johnston's MySpace).</p> <p>6. The law is hypocritical. During the Vietnam War, the MDA was dropped to 18. Why? Because it would have been disastrous to prosecute a 20-year-old who had won the congressional medal of honor for drinking a couple of brews with friends in his hometown. </p> <p>Are there any plausible counter arguments? As it happens, there are. Alcohol-related car accidents and road deaths are disproportionately high among the 16-21 age group. They were nightmarishly higher in the 1960s and 70s, when the legal drinking age was lower. States like Minnesota, which was among the first to go to 21, at the end of the 1970s, recorded a sizeable drop in young driver deaths and accidents. Prohibition is a blunt instrument, but it keeps blood off the highway.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Swarthmore College offered its students (those old enough to drink legally) a choice. They could either have cars on campus, or drink on campus. The students chose wheels. But their options highlight the dilemma at the heart of the matter.</p> <p>If you allow teenagers to drive cars and even (in some places) own guns, the 1984 alcohol prohibition is entirely rational. If you raise the legal driving age to 18, you could, reasonably. lower the drinking age to the same level. But it's tricky. </p> <p>Neither of the presidential candidates has taken a position on Amethyst. It's too hot to handle. In his heart, Obama, who has a natural constituency in the MTV generation, might be in favour. He's recently confessed to drinking and using himself as a student. </p> <p>And in his heart, that old soldier McCain might go along with Amethyst, too, married as he is to a beer heiress. One suspects that he cannot, for the life of him, see why a young marine risking his life in Iraq, and entrusted with the command of a helicopter gunship, shouldn't enjoy a Bud when off duty. </p> <p>But neither candidate could risk enraging the Mothers Against Drunk Driving right now by supporting reform. In the White House it may, perhaps, be different. But then there's the second term to think of.</p> <p>So what will happen? Nothing, anomalous nothing. Cheers.</p>",
  "<p><br>In the mix ... Samak Sundaravej (left, photo: Andy Rain/EPA) and Chow Yun-Fat</p> <p>Meet Samak Sundaravej. He's cooking up a storm. He's out of the frying pan, into the fire, and whatever other culinary cliche you care to reheat and pass off as fresh. One minute he's just another deeply unpopular world leader, up to his neck in corruption and clinging to office by his fingernails. The next, disaster! He's pitched into the slop-bucket and fed to the pigs. And all on account of that dratted cookery show.</p> <p>So yes, this week's Casting the News concerns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/thailand\">Samak, the prime minister of Thailand</a> who has just been ruled to have breached the conflict of interest law after moonlighting as a celebrity chef and must therefore be drummed out of office. Hear the rumbling outrage of the People Power Party. Sniff the sweet delight of the People's Alliance for Democracy. Taste the full-bodied schadenfreude of the United People's Party for Peopledom. OK, we made that last one up \u2013 but feel free to go the Life of Brian route with this one.</p> <p>Certainly there's a lot to chew over here. Samak was the host of a cookery show called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMfRHMqBDQ8\">Tasting, Grumbling</a>, in which he would prowl the wet markets of Bangkok, remonstrating with stall-holders, pausing only to whip up his trademark dish of \"pork leg in Coca-Cola\" (no Tesco own brand for Samak). His critics allege that he was actually never more than a puppet stooge of one <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZnteOhgq1LvlCAZWxAjH68KQhcw\">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, the former PM who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now purportedly pulls the strings from exile in the UK. </p> <p>It strikes me that Samak's saga could be played as a classic love triangle, with our hero caught between two masters and acting like a fool. Who's his real boss? The deposed Thaksin or the rapacious executives at Coca-Cola Global, insisting that he takes time off from a crucial summit to televise another pork stewing session? I think the film needs a goofy, quirky approach. Someone like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F86s4Vq59Ks\">David O Russell could make a good fist</a> of it.</p> <p>As to the casting, we note that Samak is actually of Chinese descent. Chow Yun-Fat might be a good candidate for the role. Alternatively, you could take a crass, Hollywood approach and dragoon in - ooh, let's go crazy here \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/13/comedy.benstiller\">Ben Stiller</a> as Samak, Vince Vaughn as Thaksin and Owen Wilson as Mr Coca-Cola. </p> <p>Here's what we need \u2026</p> <p>Samak Sundaravej:</p> <p>Thaksin Shinawatra:</p> <p>The Coca-Cola Executive:</p> <p>Director:</p> <p>Title:</p> <p>Tagline:</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/sep/04/castingthenews2\">Sarah Palin story</a>, meanwhile, shows no signs of reaching the closing credits, what with all that kerfuffle over Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cartoon/2008/sep/11/sara.palin.us.elections\">lipstick-on-a-pig</a> line. There was huge support for Mary McDonnell in the title role, so I guess we'll run with that - although I'm secretly voting for Greatpoochini's choice of Sandra Bullock. GreenMachine suggests Bruce Willis to play McCain and Karl Rove as director. Finally, dfic1999's tagline (\"Underneath the hockey mask, evil lurks\") guarantees shudders all the way to November \u2013 and possibly beyond.</p>",

(Interestingly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/10/sportsrights.television\" target=\"_blank\">the MediaGuardian.co.uk story on the decision</a> saw a massive surge in traffic after 9pm as England took control in Zagreb).</p> <p>While the 6pm announcement was made at the last minute, the follow-up news that highlights would also be made available on Setanta.com was not revealed until 8.50pm - at half-time in the England-Croatia game.</p> <p>It is fair to say there are a lot of angry football fans out there looking for someone to blame about the fiasco - not least those who sang \"We hate Setanta\" at Saturday's Andorra-England clash.</p> <p>Still, as national hopes soar on the solid progression of the English team, which has made a fine art of over-promising and under-delivering, Setanta will find itself under increasing pressure to strike highlights deals.</p> <p>Setanta paid \u00a35m for the TV rights and is under increasing pressure to deliver subscribers and make good on its rights investments - while rival broadcasters claim it is after unrealistic amounts for highlights packages.</p> <p>\"The problem is if everyone knows they can catch decent highlights at around 11pm Setanta may not pull subscribers through,\" said one senior TV executive. \"They can't do this every time.\"</p> <p>So what does happen next time?

  "<p>David Roberts claimed his 10th Paralympic gold medal in the pool with victory in the men's S7 400m freestyle at the National Aquatics Centre in Beijing today. The 28-year-old from Pontypridd, who has cerebral palsy, clocked a world record of 4min 52.35sec after leading from start to finish to take Britain's gold medal haul to 25. American Lantz Lamback was second, 4.11sec behind Roberts, and Australia's Jay Dohnt was third.</p> <p>\"It was a race I was always in control of - I knew after 50 [metres] I'd won,\" said Roberts. \"It's kind of a surreal feeling in a Paralympic final to know with seven lengths to go nobody was coming past me.\"</p> <p>Cowdenbeath's Andrew Lindsay was fifth in 5:02.74, and the 28-year-old four-time Paralympian paid tribute to his team-mate. \"To do 10 at three Games - that's something else, that's unbelievable,\" said Lindsay. \"He's a great guy and he's got some talent.\"</p> <p>Britain picked up a further three bronze medals at the Water Cube on another successful day. Louise Watkin finished third in the women's SM9 200m individual medley, while Sam Hynd was also third in the men's SM8 200m individual medley before Heather Frederiksen won bronze in the corresponding women's event.</p> <p>Watkins, from Merstham, came home in 2min 40.31sec for her second bronze of the Paralympics, behind South African Olympian Natalie Du Toit and Canada's Stephanie Dixon. Du Toit, who finished 16th in the women's open water marathon at last month's Olympics, broke her own world record in a time of 2min 27.83sec.</p> <p>In the SM8 200m individual medley Hynd, 17, finished in 2min 29.93sec, 9.01sec behind Australia's Peter Leek, who set a world record of 2min 20.92sec. Frederiksen clocked 2min 53.15sec in her race as America's Jessica Long won by lowering her own world record to 2min 41.85sec. The 22-year-old from Leigh had already won silver in the women's S8 100m freestyle on day two and gold in the women's S8 100m backstroke on day four.</p> <p>On the lake at Shunyi, Britons Helene Raynsford and Tom Aggar became the first Paralympic rowing gold medallists in history, with both recording emphatic victories in their 1,000m single sculls races in Beijing.</p> <p>Raynsford, 28, completed her race in 6min 12.93sec, 12.51 seconds clear of the field in the first ever Paralympic rowing final. Aggar, the 24-year-old world champion, collected the Paralympic title with a time of 5min 22.09sec, nearly six seconds quicker than Ukrainian silver medallist Oleksandr Petrenko.</p> <p>The two rowing golds were Britain's second and third on day five, after shooter Matt Skelhon triumphed earlier in the day. The 23-year-old from Peterborough won the mixed R3 10 metres air rifle prone with a score of 704.9, just 0.5 ahead of China's Zhang Cuiping, with South Korea's Sim Jae-Yong taking bronze.</p> <p>Skelhon held the edge throughout the 10-shot final, securing victory with a closing effort of 10.3, while team-mate Nathan Milgate was 12th. Skelhon's success helped Britain to remain in hot pursuit of medal table leaders China, who won four gold medals early on day five to take their total to 28.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an athlete from the Irish delegation to the Games has been excluded from competition because he did not meet the minimal disability criteria for his condition. Derek Malone was due to feature in Ireland's seven-a-side football team, but a classification ruling by the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association deemed him ineligible to participate.</p> <p>Malone, who won bronze in the T38 800 metres in Athens, entered the tournament as a CP8 - for players with the lowest level of cerebral palsy - and was assessed during Ireland's 4-2 loss to Iran on Monday. The Paralympic Council of Ireland were then informed of the decision.</p> <p>The PCI believe the 28-year-old from Limerick, who is employed as one of their strength and conditioning coaches, has been disqualified for optimising his performance through training. There is no cure for cerebral palsy, but the condition can be managed. \"I find it ridiculous,\" said Malone, who opted to play football in Beijing after the T38 800m was removed from the athletics programme. \"High performance sport is about pushing the limits. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth because of the principles that I believe in: hard work, discipline and the chance to show what you can do.\"</p> <p>There is no opportunity for the PCI to appeal against the ruling, but they have received the support of their counterparts from Ukraine, Brazil and Holland, who believe the football classification system is flawed.</p> <p>Out on the track, agony struck again for Great Britain wheelchair racer David Weir as he finished with bronze in the men's T54 5,000m final. Weir was well-placed at the bell but, having been troubled with illness since Sunday, could not push forward and Thailand's Prawat Wahoram took gold in 10min 22.38sec.</p> <p>Australian Kurt Fearnley pipped Weir five metres from the line to claim silver, with the 29-year-old from Wallington, Surrey, finishing in 10min 23.03sec. The three-time Paralympian won silver and bronze in Sydney and was second in the men's T54 400m on day four.</p>",
  "<p>Israel and Israeli settlers have effectively annexed about 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of land in the occupied West Bank, some of it privately owned by Palestinians, an Israeli human rights group said today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.btselem.org/English/\">B'Tselem</a>, which opposes settlements on land occupied in the 1967 war, said some settlements were up to two and a half times larger than their designated area, either through fencing land off or intimidation.</p> <p>In a report, it said this harms Palestinian farmers, who face almost impassable bureaucratic obstacles when trying to reach their property. As a result, many are forced to stop cultivating their land.</p> <p>Control of the land is maintained primarily by settlers and sometimes by Israeli security forces. </p> <p>Palestinians who go near settlements are attacked and harassed, and lands are fenced off by physical and electronic means to block Palestinian access, B'Tselem said.</p> <p>It said Israeli officials sought to justify their policy by citing the security need for a \"warning space\" around the settlements in order to help protect settlers. </p> <p>It acknowledged that Palestinians killed 31 Israeli civilians in settlements in the West Bank between 2002 and 2004, wounding many others. \"However, B'Tselem's research has demonstrated that the authorities permit settlers to access these purported 'warning areas'. </p> <p>\"B'Tselem has documented settlers living on, and tending to, closed off Palestinian lands. This contradicts the security logic cited by the army and defies the closure orders issued by the military commander.\"</p> <p>Some 70,000 settlers live beyond the barrier of barbed wire tipped fences and cement walls Israel is constructing in the West Bank, and security authorities view their settlements as particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>The Israeli army said the security zones were established after settlements came under repeated attack by Palestinians. \"The use of these zones has been approved a number of times by the Israeli supreme court. Any building in these zones is illegal,\" the army said.</p> <p>B'Tselem said it could give only a rough estimate of the total territory closed to Palestinians, but that at least 1,126 acres outside the 12 settlements had been \"unofficially annexed\", with half of the closed-off land privately owned by Palestinians.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Yesha settler's council, an umbrella group for Israelis living in the West Bank, said taking control of the areas was a necessary security measure.</p> <p>\"It must be clear to B'Tselem that if their demands are heeded, it will be easier to murder Jews,\" Yishai Hollander told Reuters.</p> <p>The Israeli vice-prime minister, Haim Ramon, has proposed compensation for settlers living beyond the West Bank barrier who agree to move to Israel or to major settlement enclaves it intends to keep in any peace deal with the Palestinians.</p> <p>B'Tselem argues that Israel is obliged to evacuate all settlements, given their illegality. \"The only lawful way to protect the settlers is by evacuating them and returning them to Israel,\" the group said.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, again criticised settlement activity when she was in Israel last month for the latst round of peace talks. </p> <p>Under the Washington-backed road map peace plan, Israel is supposed to freeze all construction in the settlements. </p> <p>But according to <a href=\"http://www.peacenow.org.il/site/en/peace.asp?pi=61&amp;docid=3380\">Peace Now</a>, another Israeli group, Israel has nearly doubled the number of homes under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank this year despite continuing negotiations with the Palestinians. </p> <p>Peace Now said the housing ministry had begun work on 433 new housing units between January and May this year, compared with 240 in the same period last year. It cited figures from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The latest installment in our series of classic reports was published in The Observer on Sunday September 17 1978. Two days previously Muhammad Ali, aged 36, had become the first three-time heavyweight champion in history. His opponent, Leon Spinks, had taken the world title off Ali earlier in 1978 winning a decision over 15 rounds in Las Vegas. The rematch described here was the final peak of Ali's glorious career. He retired the following June, before returning for his ignominious final series of fights against Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick. Here then was Ali in his pomp for the final time, a master of his domain, making \"suckers\" of the press. He had just founded WORLD, the World Organization for Right, Liberty, and Dignity, and the confidence with which he speaks of the future here makes a stark, sad contrast with his condition in the years still to unfold. </strong></p> <p><strong>The author is Hugh McIlvanney, Observer Sport correspondent between 1962 and 1993. McIlvanney was one of the last of the great boxing writers of the old school, joining the likes of George Plimpton, Hunter S Thompson and Norman Mailer by the ringside at Ali's feet. </strong> <br> There was just too much history bearing down on Leon Spinks in the New Orleans Superdrome on Friday night, and he was left feeling as mesmerised and helpless as a boy trying to shovel against an avalanche. Muhammad Ali's Third Coming to the heavyweight championship of the world was an exercise not so much in brilliance as in contrived inevitability. He and half the people on the planet wanted this victory so badly that Ali, having tortured his 36-year-old body in training to the point where it was once again an outrageous instrument of his dreams, was able to spit on the calendar and turn the fierce youthfulness of Spinks into something humiliatingly self-destructive. Seven months ago, the 25-year-old from the St Louis ghetto looked like an inescapable Nemesis, a force strong and irreverent enough to close an era as he swarmed brutally through the disintegrating remnants of his boyhood hero's resistance to take the title in Las Vegas. On Friday night he looked what his record said he should be: a brave and powerful novice, burdened with inexperience and the extreme limitations of a recently converted amateur. </p> <p>These 15 rounds were less of a championship match than a procession, a New Orleans parade without a jazz band. There was scarcely a hint of serious discomfort as Ali rode the juggernaut of his ambition to the limits of uniqueness in his sport, to a success that made him the first heavyweight to take the title three times, and did so, unbelievably, more than 14 years after he first made monkeys of the forecasters by draining the ogre out of Sonny Liston. Here, after a first round in which his punches were extravagantly mistimed, he swiftly found distance and rhythm and established a pattern that frustrated and all but demoralised his opponent. </p> <p>Even when the three Louisiana officials had taken the fifth round away from Ali because they felt his holding during those three minutes amounted to fouling, none of them could leave him with a total of fewer than 10 rounds. The referee, Lucien Joubert, gave ten to Ali, and four to Spinks, with one even, and so did one of the judges, Ernest Cojoe, while the second judge, Herman Duitreix, had it 11-4 with no even rounds.<br> Few of the unofficial cards at ringside could credit the loser with any more, and many gave him less. It was a tribute to the persistence of his spirit that he took the fourteenth, and perhaps the fifteenth, too, as Ali's legs and arms began to tire after 40 minutes of astonishing fluency. But, leaving out the question of rule violations in the fifth, it was hard to accept that the defending champion had done more than share any of the other rounds. </p> <p>Spinks had come to the ring with more handicaps than any young boxer could be expected to carry in only the ninth fight of his professional career. There were about 70,000 people in the soaring vastness of the Superdome (easily the largest indoor crowd boxing has known), and most of them \u2013 from the celebrities like Jackie Onassis and President Carter's mother, John Travolta and Kris Kristofferson, to beer-slugging red-necks on upper tiers so remote that they might have been in the next county \u2013 were vociferously prejudiced. </p> <p>Spinks was booed as he ducked through the ropes as champion, and, as if Ali's friends weren't enough of a problem, his own corner was such an overcrowded Babel of confusing advice that the one man most likely to provide a constructive theme between rounds walked away from the chaos after the sixth. George Benton, an outstanding middleweight when he fought out of Philadelphia, and now a skilled tutor who did much to channel Spinks's natural violence into profitable aggression in Las Vegas, had said during the champion's haphazard training that he was being prevented from offering maximum assistance.<br> 'They're cutting my throat, stopping me from helping the kid,' he had said then. Now, as he moved disconsolately through the hysteria of the ringside audience, he muttered: 'What can I do? There are 10 people up there in that corner. What can I do? There are too many amateurs up there.' </p> <p>That was true, and the sad fact was that the boy wearing the gloves looked like one of them. Spinks had affected an unworried grin, showing the gum-shield like a surrogate denture, as Ali danced away from his charges or repelled him with flicking jabs, and single and double hooks in the early rounds.<br> But his depression became blatant as Ali's strength refused to wane as the older man blended glimpses of his former foot and hand speed with punishing improvisations learned over 18 hard years against the toughest men in the world, tricks that enabled him to war as well as box with such as Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman. Spinks felt the heel of the glove and the bare hardness of the forearm more than once. Above all, he found his most hopeful rushes smothered at birth by the holding that Ali has developed to a level where it has less in common with a boxer's survival technique than a wrestler's belligerence. </p> <p>Lucien Joubert, perhaps responding to the collective desire that came down in clamorous waves from the rim of the arena and with silent force from the countless committed millions beyond permitted far more of that clutching, hauling and spinning than had been seen last February, and the challenger benefited from the referee's leniency. </p> <p>But such questionable passages would have been rendered insignificant if Ali had not linked them with surges of selective, effective attacking, circling fleetly and watchfully, jabbing with increasing confidence and accuracy, sometimes hooking off the jab, releasing the occasional brisk combination of hooks and uppercuts, looking to land overhand rights, the flourishing Shuffle always adding to his overall control, causing his victim's eyes to cloud with the realisation that the discrepancy in class was irreversible.<br> Spinks had indicated during the preliminaries a heavy awareness of what an ordeal the evening would be. Ali was solemnly, almost morosely, undemonstrative, and any Muslim praying he did was unaccompanied by conspicuous gesture (he may, of course, have been relying on the celestial canvassing of his manager, Herbert Muhammad, son of the founder of the Black Muslims, who spent the entire contest with his eyes cast down and his lips moving noiselessly while Angelo Dundee, Bundini Brown and the others in the corner jabbered and whooped). </p> <p>After dropping on to his knees and closing his eyes for a long Catholic prayer, Spinks spent nearly a full minute before the first bell embracing his brother Michael, a fellow Olympic champion in Montreal. He appeared uncharacteristically conscious of the weight of the occasion, and that impression was reinforced later when he admitted to interviewing journalists that he had been unable to concentrate with the intensity that a title defence demands. </p> <p>'My body was ready, but my mind wasn't on the fight,' he said, and quickly became bellicose when pressed on the strangeness of that admission 'Maybe it was because l had a lot of other things on my mind, a lot of problems that come with the heavyweight championship.' he offered eventually. 'Who knows, I don't. That just wasn't me in there, period. But I won't cry because I have lost once, it won't keep me from sleeping or from going back to the gym.' </p> <p>Nor did it keep him from congratulating Ali or declaring that the master is still his idol. Ali in turn described Spinks as a gentleman and made the familiar prediction that the man he had just out-classed would end up as champion after he had gone. He made it clear, however, that he was in no hurry to step aside. 'The title is too hard to get,' he said. 'I'm not going to give it up without thinking. I'm going to sit down for six or eight months and think about it. Then I'll decide whether to fight again. I would never want to go out a loser. I've always planned to be the first black man to retire undefeated, and to do it now after being champion three times would be something no one could ever equal. I have made suckers out of all of you. I was training three months before you knew it. </p> <p>'That couldn't have been Ali in that ring tonight. It couldn't have been the old man, the washed-up 36-year-old fighter dancing through 15 rounds against a 25-year-old boy. M-a-a-a-a-a-n, that was a miracle, and can you imagine what it means. I was great in defeat, what will I be to the peoples of the world after this. I'm going to get on with setting up my WORLD organisation to help the poor folks of the world, to help the hungry and those with diseases and famines and all kinds of troubles. </p> <p>'If you think I have done something now, wait till you see what I do as president of WORLD. We now have tax-exemption, we now have a charter. We're going to have offices all round the world, an office in the Kremlin, an office in Bangladesh. I'm going to Moscow in about another month to see President Brezhnev. I told him I'd go back to see him after I regained my title. About 16 presidents of various nations have now given their approval. WORLD, it's going to be doing good to people all over the globe.'<br> When he turned to the influences that had done him good in the Superdome he began with Allah and went on by way of Dick Gregory and his vitamin-charged juices to the Muslim doctor who had prescribed 'half-a-pint of ice-cream and a big hunk of honey 30 minutes before the fight'. That last declaration of faith produced smiles around the room but no sneers. If Ali decided he could make it across the Okinawa Deep in a pair of old wellies we would have to rate his chances only slightly worse than evens.</p>",
  "<p><strong>11.30am</strong> As you may have guessed, rain has prevented any play so far today at The Oval, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>. With Hampshire 480 for eight overnight and Surrey basically needing to win this game and their final fixture against championship-chasing Nottinghamshire to have any chance of avoiding the drop, things are looking grim for a side whose famous strut has turned into an embarrassed limp. </p> <p>If Kevin Pietersen has the Midas touch\u2122, then Surrey have spent the season honing its diametric opposite. None of their left-field signings have come off: the 40-year-old Chris Lewis played in just two one-day matches for combined figures of 8-0-80-0; Alex Tudor has taken five championship wickets in three-and-a-bit games since being rescued from Essex; and Shoaib Akhtar's attempts to prove his fitness to Pakistan (while simultaneously insulting the men who hold his fate in their hands) has revolved around desultory spells of four overs apiece. Some would say Surrey deserve what they are about to get.</p> <p>Hampshire, meanwhile, are not guaranteed safety either. If, for the sake of argument, rain prevents any more play here today and tomorrow, they would be just eight points clear of Yorkshire and Lancashire (in eighth and seventh) but with only one game left to the Roses duo's two. We could be in for a dogfight, even if it is a wet one.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> Durham have shaded a shortened morning at Taunton, <em>writes David Hopps</em>, progressing to 97-2 from their overnight 45-1. Mark Stoneman is the batsman out, yorked by Alfonso Thomas. Durham are now only 127 behind and, despite the loss of the first hour because of overnight rain, a solid afternoon would put them in a strong position by tea.</p> <p> And, if you can survive the excitement, we have an ICC awards winner in our midst. Shivnarine Chanderpaul has the chance to assert Durham's supremacy, hours after becoming the fifth player to win the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy as the ICC's Cricketer of the Year. Perhaps it is about to inspire him into a match-winning knock.</p> <p>This is a strange award, treated with utmost seriousness in India, where glittering awards ceremonies can stop the nation in its tracks, and cause celebrities to rush towards the camera flashes like moths to a flame, but entirely ignored in England. Even when Andrew Flintoff was a joint winner in 2005, it barely gained a mention. Had Chanderpaul wandered into the Kings Arms in Taunton last night brandishing his trophy he would have been asked to get out of the way because England had a corner.</p> <p>The ICC special release on this momentous occasion revealed Chanderpaul's wise words \"upon collecting the award\". This is quite strange as he spent most of yesterday standing at second slip for Durham in Taunton and, as far as I know, he did not take a private jet to the Grosvenor Hotel in Dubai.</p> <p>But it would be remiss not to record the words that the ICC would have you presume that he spoke in Dubai. \"I am honoured to be given this prestigious award tonight and I am very thankful to God for blessing me with the talent that I have. I would like to thank my family \u2013 in particular my wife Amy \u2013 for their constant support over the years. </p> <p>\"A special thank you goes out to my manager, my agent and all my supporters in the Caribbean and throughout the world. It's also important that I thank my team-mates without whom this wouldn't have been possible.\"</p> <p>David Morgan, the ICC president, called Chanderpaul \"a rock\" for his performances for the West Indies - which brought an average of 91 over eight Tests and 75 in 13 ODIs. It is to be hoped that Morgan wasn't under the illusion that he was shaking hands with Chanderpaul as he presented the trophy, or that he had been hoodwinked by a 5ft 7in Guyanan lookalike who was actually a sugar trader in Georgetown who fancied a free trip.</p> <p>The choice of Chanderpaul probably represents the first definite decision that the ICC has made since Morgan took control of one of the most thankless jobs in sport. Even now India are probably planning to overturn it.</p> <p>The ICC release also records how KW Kim, chief executive of LG Electronics for the Middle East, congratulated Chanderpaul on his award. Even now, if you imagine hard enough, you can see him shaking hands and smiling broadly. But it never happened and, in the circumstances, it seems unnecessary to provide a total transcript of his speech.</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Overnight and early morning rain hasn't left the outfield too saturated, so it's a 1.30pm start at Northampton, <em>writes Richard Rae</em>. With only five sessions remaining, Essex, presumably, will simply look to bat well into tomorrow and maximise their bonus point return. Ravi Bopara versus Monty Panesar could be fun, though.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> There is no cricket here at the Swalec Stadium \u2013 the match between Glamorgan and Worcestershire could be washed out for the second day in a row \u2013 but that is not to say there is not plenty of gossip about the place, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>.</p> <p>Mike Fatkin, Glamorgan's chief executive, is understood to have quit the club just 10 months before the historic first Test match is due to be played at this ground. </p> <p>England's match against Australia, the opening clash in next summer's Ashes series, is due to start here on July 8 and only yesterday the genial Fatkin was seen bustling about the ground and talking about further improvements to the already revamped facilities. Just eight days ago the ground staged the last of the five ODI fixtures between England and South Africa, though it was washed out after just three overs.</p> <p>Fatkin, a Yorkshireman, is understood to have left the club last night. He was one of the longest-serving chief executives on the circuit and after taking over from Gwyn Stone was in charge when Glamorgan won the county championship in 1997.</p> <p>Lately, though, things have not been going as well on the field. Glamorgan were relegated from the first division in 2005, finished last but one of division two in 2006 and were bottom last year. A statement from Glamorgan is expected later today.</p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Play is finally under way at The Oval, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>, and Hampshire have declared on their overnight 480 for eight, leaving Nic Pothas stranded on 137. That leaves 55 overs today \u2013 showers permitting \u2013 and a possible 151 in the match for Surrey to engineer the most unlikely of victories and keep alive any hope they have of staying in the first division. Chris Tremlett has just opened with a maiden to Scott Newman.</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> It would be an overstatement to suggest that Shivnarine Chanderpaul has gloriously entertained us at Taunton after being named as ICC Player of the Year, <em>writes David Hopps</em>, but he has certainly put Durham in the ascendancy in the top-of-the-table affair against Somerset. Durham are 184-2 in 75 overs, only 40 runs behind, but just as the match was beginning to develop a heavy shower has forced the players to break for tea a few minutes early. There are some contrary weather forecasts about, and the rain here seems quite localised, so I haven't a clue what might happen. There is another inspection at 4.5pm. This county blog should be reached from the weather link.</p> <p>Chanderpaul is 64 not out, Di Venuto 95 not out, and their unbroken stand is worth 125. This has been classic Shiv. For the first couple of hours, one imagined that the ICC press release was right, and that he really had spent last night at the ICC awards in Dubai. He didn't as much rest on his bat as fall asleep on it, producing a series of considered defensive pushes from his strange, crablike stance as if oblivious to where he was. At one point Durham scored 27 in 24 overs and Wes Durston, who had been fielding close in, and who has never taken a championship wicket, bowled in his pads. When Di Venuto swept Durston to midwicket it was the first boundary for 85 minutes. Shiv's fifty took 124 balls and when it was announced, nobody clapped. The crowd would have been just as happy if the groundstaff had brought a little podium out to the square and announced that David Morgan was about to address them on behalf of the ICC on the subject of corporate governance. </p> <p>But then, imperceptibly, Shiv and Di Venuto switched gear. Di Venuto went from second to third. Shiv, as he does, went from first to fourth. Somerset supporters complaining that the game was going nowhere began to shift uneasily in their seats. Di Venuto lofted Durston for six over long-on, Shiv clipped Peter Trego serenely through midwicket, and suddenly there weree gaps everywhere.</p> <p>Somerset still have 55 overs to chase some bowling bonus points. It is long enough to bowl Durham out. But while Di Venuto and Chanderpaul remain they must fear that Durham are in the mood to squeeze them dry.</p> <p><strong>4.05pm</strong> Whatever Surrey manage here at The Oval has the feel of deckchair-rearrangement on the Titanic, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>. And they've even made a bit of a hash of that. Faced with the prospect of batting for 27 overs before tea following Hampshire's declaration on 480 for eight and some grisly weather, they have gone into the break at 86 for three following a disastrous over in which Scott Newman carved James Tomlinson to cover to waste an attractive innings of 58 and Jon Batty chanced his arm second ball, only to be beaten by Michael Carberry's direct hit from cover. Crazy cricket.</p> <p>Newman and Mark Ramprakash had looked good while consolidating after the early loss of Matt Spriegel, who feathered a flat-footed drive to Nic Pothas off Dimitri Mascarenhas to depart for a duck in the fourth over. Newman carved his way to a 58-ball fifty including 10 fours while Ramprakash, who survived a big shout for caught behind off Tomlinson on one, settled in. At 78 for one, all was calm; at 78 for three, it was more like pandemonium. Surrey have four sessions left to achieve a miracle, although their chances have not been helped by the fact that they bowled two fewer overs than they should have done during the Hampshire innings. A two-point deduction is all they need.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong> There is nothing more to add on the Mike Fatkin situation at this stage, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em> at Cardiff. But it is a strange one. The club are neither confirming nor denying the story that they parted company with Fatkin last night.<br> Chairman Paul Russell has just said: \"I've got absolutely no comment to make. This is pure speculation.\" Fatkin, 44, has gone, though, unless he's hiding under the covers that are once again covering the square. Whether he has resigned or been fired remains uncertain and Glamorgan seem reluctant to clarify the situation. Shades of Kevin Keegan at Newcastle? Is this a club really fit to stage an Ashes Test match?</p> <p>As for the cricket here, forget it. After a number of inspections it was finally decided that play would start at 4.30pm. But at 3.40 the heavens opened again and that was it. Another blank day in a truly awful summer.</p>",
  "<p>The government could learn a thing or two about tackling violence against women from the US vice-presidential candidate. No, I don't mean the gun-toting, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/uselections2008.sexeducation\">anti-abortionist</a> Sarah Palin. I'm referring to Joe Biden, senator for Delaware and Barack Obama's running mate for the Democrats. For Biden is the man who wrote the groundbreaking <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3402enr.txt.pdf\">Violence Against Women Act</a> (Vawa, pdf) in 1994 that was renewed \u2013 and strengthened \u2013 in 2000 and 2005. </p> <p>The Vawa has led to programmes, laws and initiatives including a <a href=\"http://www.ndvh.org/\">national domestic</a> violence hotline, improved criminal justice responses, better legal access for poor and immigrant women, prevention programmes and \u2013 critically - funding for support services such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centres. Administered by the Department of Justice, more than $5bn has been awarded to governments and community-based responses under the Vawa. It's no wonder that Biden says he considers the act the \"single most significant legislation that I've crafted during my 35-year tenure in the Senate\".</p> <p>In America, the Vawa represents a concerted national effort to tackle gender-based violence. Closer to home, the Scottish government has also been addressing violence against women more <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/violence-women\">strategically</a> and a national violence-against-women fund has led to the expansion of Rape Crisis Centres. </p> <p>In contrast, there is a fractured, criminal justice-driven approach in the rest of the UK that has resulted in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/26/acrisisforwomen\">funding crisis</a> for women's support services. The Rape Crisis sector south of the border is being decimated as one group after another closes because of funding cuts.</p> <p>There are now just 38 affiliated Rape Crisis Centres left in England and Wales \u2013 half the number there were in the 1980s \u2013 and no funded centres in Northern Ireland at all \u2013 meaning that most rape victims do not have access to the specialist support they deserve. A one-off injection from the government of \u00a31m to shore up centres facing immediate closure is welcome but not a long-term solution.</p> <p>In fact, one-in-three local authorities across the UK do not have domestic violence shelters or other specialist services at all as was graphically demonstrated by End Violence Against Women and the Equality and Human Rights Commission last year in our <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/blog/5050/map_of_gaps_the_postcode_lottery_in_violence_against_women_support_services\">Map of Gaps</a> report. </p> <p>Nevertheless, ministers are digging their heels in by maintaining that funding for life-saving services is not possible at a national level, rather it is the responsibility of local authorities. Unfortunately, as a result of local commissioning processes, local authorities are increasingly turning to larger, generic services such as housing providers or faith organisations which are cheaper than women's organisations but do not have the expertise on gender-based violence that's been developed over decades in the women's sector.</p> <p>In addition, services for ethnic minority women, which deal with issues like forced marriage, are being squeezed by community cohesion guidance from the government on the funding of single strand groups. Ealing council in west London has recently been forced to rethink its decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/27/seenbutnotheard2\">stop funding</a> Southall Black Sisters after High Court action. Other councils are also facing legal action as Trevor Phillips, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has warned that the commission will use the Gender Equality Duty against local authorities if they fail to ensure that women have access to specialist services. </p> <p>So you could say it's all a bit of a mess. </p> <p>Meanwhile in America there is the prospect of a vice-president who believes that national funding of violence against women services is one of the biggest achievements of his political career. Ministers here could take a leaf out of senator Biden's book.</p>",
  "<p>Enough is enough! REM became the latest in a spate of high-profile instrument robberies when Peter Buck's beloved guitar was stolen at a Finnish gig on Tuesday. Clearly, it's time for the world to organise a sort of musical Interpol (Minterpol?), with crime-solving super-soldiers who will hunt down the instrument thieves. </p> <p>REM have reluctantly joined a club including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/07/iron.maiden.guitar.stolen\">Iron Maiden</a>, who had a Jackson stratocaster stolen in Greece, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/06/iggy.pop.stooges.equipment.theft\">Iggy and the Stooges</a>, who lost an entire lorry of equipment after a Canadian gig in July. Neither group has regained the items.</p> <p>While Finland is supposed to be a country of polite, law-abiding citizens, there was at least one snake in the Helsinki grass after REM played at Finnair Stadium on September 9. Not long after Peter Buck left the stage, his Rickenbacker 360 guitar disappeared.</p> <p>\"Needless to say, this instrument means a great deal to Peter and to REM,\" the band said in a statement. The guitar made its debut on REM's 1982's single Chronic Town, and Buck was still playing it on this year's Accelerate. Now the band are simply hoping to get it back.</p> <p>\"It is our sincere hope that whoever is responsible for the loss, or whoever has information which can help recover the guitar, will come forward to receive a generous reward, no questions asked,\" they said.</p> <p>At least one English fan has gone a step further, declaring on an <a href=\"http://www.murmurs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=113703\">REM message-board</a> that he will pay \u00a3500 for any information leading to the missing guitar. \"I know it is not much, but all I can afford!\" bellowed a 24-year-old user called richardscott1983. </p> <p>Somebody hire this kid for Minterpol.<br></p>",
  "<p><em>I recently bought a new quad-core desktop machine, but I am considering increasing the amount of Ram from the 3GB now installed. Would I have to upgrade to the 64-bit version to increase my memory? I want to use my PC for gaming, but I have a fondness for my back catalogue of games.</em><br><strong>Jez Robinson</strong> </p> <p>As you know, 32-bit Windows can only use 4GB of memory, which means about 3.25GB after you've allowed for graphics and system use. The 64-bit versions can access more memory than your motherboard can support. However, the upgrade path from your 32-bit Packard Bell version is not smooth. Although Microsoft sells \"in place upgrades\" (hence the 15GB of disk space devoted to Vista), you can't upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit Vista without reinstalling it as a new operating system. <em>(Note: if you're installing a 64-bit upgrade version, don't delete the 32-bit version first!)</em></p> <p>Also, you will have to pay for your new operating system. If you buy a boxed copy of Vista, you can run either the 32-bit or the 64-bit version, so the upgrade is free. (There may be a charge for shipping you a new disc: only Vista Ultimate includes media for both.) But if you have a manufacturer's pre-installed version, what you've bought is all you get. Unless Packard Bell can offer you a deal, you may have to pay \u00a370 or more for a retail or upgrade version. See Microsoft's guide, <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932795/en-us\">Knowledge Base article 932795</a>.<br></p> <p>Whether it's worth it is a difficult question, but gamers were among the first to move to 64-bit Vista so you should be able to check for compatibility and performance of specific games online. In general, 64-bit Vista is faster and more secure, it runs 32-bit software, and cheap Ram means sales are now growing rapidly. However, it does not run old 16-bit software, and that unfortunately includes 32-bit programs with 16-bit installation routines. Two obvious solutions are to set up your PC as a dual-boot system, so you can switch between versions, or to install 32-bit Vista in a \"virtual PC\". There are several free virtual PC programs including Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, VMware and VirtualBox (version 1.6.2 or later). There are lots of demos and tutorials on YouTube.<br></p>",

  "<p>The Iraq war has been replaced by the declining economy as the most important issue in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">America's presidential election</a> campaign, in part because Americans have come to believe that the tide has turned in Iraq: the troop \"surge\" has supposedly cowed the insurgents, bringing a decline in violence. The implications are clear: a show of power wins the day. </p> <p>It is precisely this kind of macho reasoning that led America to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">war in Iraq</a> in the first place. The war was meant to demonstrate the strategic power of military might. Instead, the war showed its limitations. Moreover, the war undermined America's real source of power \u2013 its moral authority.</p> <p>Recent events have reinforced the risks in the Bush administration's approach. It was always clear that the timing of America's departure from Iraq might not be its choice \u2013 unless it wanted to violate international law once again. Now, Iraq is demanding that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/iraq.usa\">American combat troops leave</a> within 12 months, with all troops out in 2011.</p> <p>To be sure, the reduction in violence is welcome, and the surge in troops may have played some role. Yet the level of violence, were it taking place anywhere else in the world, would make headlines; only in Iraq have we become so inured to bloodshed that it is a good day if only 25 civilians get killed. </p> <p>And the role of the troop surge in reducing violence in Iraq is not clear. Other factors were probably far more important, including buying off Sunni insurgents so that they fight with the United States against al-Qaida. But that remains a dangerous strategy. The US should be working to create a strong, unified government, rather than strengthening sectarian militias. Now the Iraqi government has awakened to the dangers, and has begun arresting some of the leaders whom the American government has been supporting. The prospects of a stable future look increasingly dim. </p> <p>That is the key point: the surge was supposed to provide space for a political settlement, which would provide the foundations of long-term stability. That political settlement has not occurred. So, as with the arguments used to justify the war, and the measures of its success, the rationale behind surge, too, keeps shifting. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the military and economic opportunity costs of this misadventure become increasingly clear. Even if the US had achieved stability in Iraq, this would not have assured victory in the \"war on terrorism,\" let alone success in achieving broader strategic objectives. Things have not been going well in Afghanistan, to say the least, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\"> Pakistan</a> looks ever more unstable. </p> <p>Moreover, most analysts agree that at least part of the rationale behind<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia\"> Russia's invasion of Georgia</a>, reigniting fears of a new Cold War, was its confidence that, with America's armed forces pre-occupied with two failing wars (and badly depleted because of a policy of not replacing military resources as fast as they are used up), there was little America could do in response. Russia's calculations proved correct. </p> <p>Even the largest and richest country in the world has limited resources. The Iraq war has been financed entirely on credit; and partly because of that, the US national debt has increased by two-thirds in just eight years. </p> <p>But things keep getting worse: the deficit for 2009 alone is expected to be more than a half-trillion dollars, excluding the costs of financial bail-outs and the second stimulus package that almost all economists now say is urgently needed. The war, and the way it has been conducted, has reduced America's room for manoeuvre, and will almost surely deepen and prolong the economic downturn.</p> <p>The belief that the surge was successful is especially dangerous because the Afghanistan war is going so poorly. America's European allies are tiring of the endless battles and mounting casualties. Most European leaders are not as practiced in the art of deception as the Bush administration; they have greater difficulty hiding the numbers from their citizens. The British, for example, are well aware of the problems that they repeatedly encountered in their imperial era in Afghanistan. </p> <p>America will, of course, continue to put pressure on its allies, but democracy has a way of limiting the effectiveness of such pressure. Popular opposition to the Iraq war made it impossible for Mexico and Chile to give in to American pressure at the United Nations to endorse the invasion; the citizens of these countries were proven right. </p> <p>But back in America, the belief that the surge \"worked\" is now leading many to argue that more troops are needed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a>. </p> <p>True, the war in Iraq distracted America's attention from Afghanistan. But the failures in Iraq are a matter of strategy, not troop strength. It is time for America, and Europe, to learn the lessons of Iraq \u2013 or, rather, relearn the lessons of virtually every country that tries to occupy another and determine its future. </p> <p>In association with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>There was some speculation in the blogosphere the other day to the effect that Gordon Brown was <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2008/09/is-brown-running-from-the-press/\">\"running from the press\"</a> and that one planned news conference had already been cancelled. </p> <p>Well, Downing Street has responded. Brown will be appearing at 10am. </p> <p>Obviously he will be using his news conference to promote the much-trailed fuel poverty package. But the journalists will want to ask him about the wider picture and, to be honest, it's doesn't look good. </p> <p>The Independent is running a story today saying Labour is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/polls-show-labour-flatlining-as-tories-stretch-their-lead-925565.html\">\"flatlining in the polls and showing no signs of making a recovery\"</a>. </p> <p>The Times is running its own polling figures saying <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4727373.ece\">that Brown is now seen as being \"much further away from the position of the average voter than Tony Blair was when he was prime minister\".</a> </p> <p>(In the paper, but not on the web, the story is accompanied by a graphic that's almost as incomprehensible as those Large Hadron Collider explainers - but the gist of it is bad for Gordon.) </p> <p>And The Times also reports that David Cameron has made the cover of the influential American magazine Time, which is describing him as a man of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4727878.ece\">\"mind-blowing confidence\".</a> Wonder if Brown gets asked about that.</p> <p><strong>10am</strong></p> <p>Brown arrives. He says he's going to be talking about energy. \"We all know we need a real and lasting change in the way we use energy\".</p> <p>There will be \"immediate help\" for those who need it most, but most of the package will concentrate on helping people save energy. It will cost \u00a31bn.</p> <p>All low-income and pensioners households will be eligible for energy saving measures that could save them an average of \u00a3300 a year.</p> <p>All households will be qualify for some sort of energy saving support.</p> <p>Around 600,000 households will benefit from \"social tariffs\", ie cheaper bills.</p> <p>The severe weather payments will be increased to \u00a325 a week.</p> <p>From tomorrow, a national information campaign will publicise all the help that is available.</p> <p>To pay for the package, the government will introduce legislation when parliament resumes to get \u00a3920m from energy firms and power providers.</p> <p>Ofgem is reviewing the competitiveness of the energy market. If there is any evidence of anti-competitive action, the government will not hesitate to act.</p> <p><strong>10.05am</strong></p> <p>Brown asks Hilary Benn, the environment secretary, to provide more details.</p> <p>Benn says there will be a community energy saving programme. He says that investing in loft insulation can save you \u00a3100, and cavity wall insulation can save you \u00a3150 a year.</p> <p>Energy companies will be writing to customers with details. There is also a hotline that people can ring.</p> <p>Brown says that John Hutton, the business secretary, is with him. But Hutton isn't invited to speak.</p> <p><strong>Windfall tax/energy</strong></p> <p>Nick Robinson asks if a windfall tax has been ruled out for good.</p> <p>Brown says he looked at all options, and that the ones announced today were the best ones. Today's package meets his objectives. He says he does not expect the costs being met by the energy companies to be passed on to the consumers.</p> <p>As for how many people will benefit, he says around 2 million will benefit from the insulation measures, and around 1.5 million from energy-saving devices.</p> <p>Benn says 12 million pensioner households are already benefiting from the winter fuel payments.</p> <p>The community programme will help around 90,000 households.</p> <p>Because of the decline in housebuilding, there is \"capacity in the system\" - ie unemployed builders free to install the insulation.</p> <p>Brown confirms something I missed earlier. All households will qualify for a 50% subsidy for insulation.</p> <p><strong>Election</strong></p> <p>Tom Bradby from ITN asks if Brown regrets not calling an election last year.</p> <p>No, says Brown. He said at the time that he wanted to show people what he stood for. He made the \"right decision\" last year.</p> <p><strong>10.15am</strong></p> <p><strong>9/11</strong></p> <p>Adam Boulton from Sky points out that it's the 9/11 anniversary. What's Brown's assessment of the current terror threat. And, in the light of the outcome of the Heathrow terror plot, does Brown think it is right to talk about the war on terror.</p> <p>Brown says Britain is \"vigilant\" in showing itself ready to protect itself from terrorism.</p> <p>But it is not possible to say anything other than \"that we are permanently on our guard\".</p> <p>What is happening in Afghanistan is important too.</p> <p><strong>Energy companies</strong></p> <p>Asked about the remarks from the E.ON boss who said that a harsh winter would mean more profits, Brown said that there had been an apology. He had been \"aghast\" at the comments.</p> <p>He points out that the energy companies will be providing a considerable amount of money. \"We do not expect that to be passed on in prices to the consumers.\"</p> <p>Hutton comes in for the first time. \"If there is any evidence that customers are being ripped off ... then the government won't hesitate to intervene.\"</p> <p>Over the last five years energy customers in the UK have enjoyed lower prices than the EU average because of the competitive energy market.</p> <p><strong>Relations with the chancellor/football</strong></p> <p>George Pascoe-Watson, political editor of the Sun, asks about last night's football, and Brown's relationship with Alistair Darling. Brown seems to fudge the chancellor issue, muttering something about \"getting on with business\". But he's much more expansive about the football.</p> <p><strong>10.20am</strong></p> <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p> <p>Cathy Newman from Channel 4 says Brown blames the global economy for Labour's problems. But does he ever have a \"dark night of the soul\" and think he might be the problems?</p> <p>Good question.</p> <p>But Brown doesn't rise to it. He rattles of the list of global economic problems. His job, he says, is to deal with them. The world is \"never going to be the same again\".</p> <p>Does he taker personal responsibility, Newman asks.</p> <p>Of course, says Brown. \"I'm the person who's in charge.\"</p> <p>Brown seems to be distinguishing between responsibility, which he accepts, and blame, which he doesn't.</p> <p><strong>Oil companies</strong></p> <p>Brown says he has already raised the taxation on oil companies.</p> <p><strong>Economy</strong></p> <p>Macer Hall from the Express asks why the EU and the OECD say Britain is the only major economy facing recession.</p> <p>Brown doesn't address this directly. He says governments have to take the right decisions that are appropriate for them. </p> <p>He has taken the right decisions about nuclear power, about climate change, about infrastructure. He says other countries had negative growth when Britain didn't. We will have to \"wait and see\" to find out what the figures are for 2008.</p> <p><strong>President Sarkozy</strong></p> <p>A foreign journalist asks if Brown supports Sarkozy's foreign policies.</p> <p>Brown says he supports what Sarkozy has done over Georgia.</p> <p>The world is changing fast, he says. The reason why oil prices are rising is simple - demand exceeds supply.</p> <p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong></p> <p>Would a power-sharing deal that left Mugabe with some kind of power be acceptable?</p> <p>Brown says he wants an outcome that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people. He wants a \"transition\" that would allow the MDC to have its legitimate place in the government of Zimbabwe.</p> <p><strong>Energy package</strong></p> <p>Will it seem like \"jam tomorrow\"?</p> <p>No, says Brown, because most people understand that there has to be a long-term change in the way we use energy.</p> <p>People realise that they can cut their use of energy \"quite significantly\".</p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong></p> <p><strong>Iran</strong></p> <p>A journalist from Fox News asks where Brown stands on Iran.</p> <p>Brown says the west has made a \"generous offer\" to Iran, requiring a freeze in its nuclear programme. There is wide international support for that position.</p> <p><strong>Metropolitan police</strong></p> <p>Ben Brogan from the Daily Mail asks if Brown is confident that Sir Ian Blair is \"still keeping his eye on the ball\" given the various discrimination cases he's dealing with.</p> <p>Brown praises the Met's records. He does not comment on Blair specifically.</p> <p><strong>Labour conference</strong></p> <p>Jason Beattie from the Mirror wants to know what Brown's message to Labour supporters will be.</p> <p>Brown says it will be the same as his message to the whole country. \"When you face challenging times, you get on with the job.\" The Labour government is \"on the side of hard-working families\".</p> <p><strong>Glenrothes byelection</strong></p> <p>Will Brown visit the constituency during the byelection campaign?</p> <p>Brown says he was there last Friday, in his capacity of chancellor of a local college. (He was not accompanied by the Labour candidate when he went). He did not say if he would be going back.</p> <p><strong>Lebanon</strong></p> <p>Brown says he's opposed to Syrian interference in Lebanon.</p> <p><strong>Terrorism</strong></p> <p>Asked about compensation for a terrorism victim, Brown says he will look into it.</p> <p><strong>Energy summit</strong></p> <p>A foreign journalist asks who will be invited to Brown's planned energy summit.</p> <p>Brown says he is still considering the guest list.</p> <p><strong>Ian Blair/Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>Does Sir Ian Blair have Brown's confidence?</p> <p>Yes, says Brown to the Blair question.</p> <p>On Afghanistan, he says he wants \"a fair sharing\" of the burden. Other countries are being asked to contribute.</p> <p><strong>Energy package</strong></p> <p>George Parker from the FT asks how the government will know whether energy companies are passing costs of the fuel package on to their customers.</p> <p>Brown says he does not expect that they will pass on the costs. \"I don't think there's a need to do so, and I don't expect it to happen.\" Which doesn't really answer the question.</p> <p>Hutton says Ofgem police the market in the interests of consumers.</p> <p>Brown says that if there is any evidence of unacceptable behaviour, the government will act.</p> <p><strong>Lisbon treaty</strong></p> <p>How much time have the Irish left to sort out the Lisbon treaty issue?</p> <p>Brown says this is a matter for the Irish. Brian Cowen, the Irish PM, will report to fellow EU leaders at their next meeting in October.</p> <p><strong>10.40am</strong></p> <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p> <p>Andy Grice from the Independent asks what Brown would say to voters who say that since Brown took credit for the economy was going well, he should take responsibility wen thing go badly.</p> <p>Brown says he does take responsibility. </p> <p>In any other country facing these circumstances, there would be a recession.</p> <p>The issue is how you deal with the problem. Compared to the 1990s, circumstances are much better. Company balance books are still healthy. The size of the world economy is going to double over the next 20 years and Britain is \"well-equipped to benefit\".</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong></p> <p>Brown says he wants a good relationship with Russia. But Britiain cannot allow a country like the UK to be \"wholly dependent\" on a single energy source.</p> <p><strong>Angola</strong></p> <p>Brown is asked about the elections in Angola. He says he can't comment on the elections there.</p> <p><strong>Reshuffle/Miliband</strong></p> <p>Quentin Letts from the Daily Mail asks if there will be a reshuffle. With a smile, Brown says he is being generous in taking a question from Letts (a severe Brown critic). But he won't comment on reshuffles.</p> <p><strong>Energy package</strong></p> <p>Asked why the government cut the warm front programme, Brown says he is now increasing funding.</p> <p>And in reference to Patrick Wintour's question about the windfall tax - Wintour asked what Brown would do if the Labour conference voted for a windfall tax - Brown doesn't explicitly say he will ignore the vote. But he reaffirms his belief that the approach he's taking his the best one.</p> <p>Benn says the total investment over the next three year to deal with this problem will be \u00a36.5bn.</p> <p><strong>10.50am</strong></p> <p><strong>Scotland</strong></p> <p>Michael Settle from the Herald asks why Brown is in favour of Scotland having further tax-raising powers. Brown says that is not his position. His speech to the Scottish CBI did not go further than what he had said already.</p> <p><strong>Sustainable investment rule</strong></p> <p>Asked if he is now prepared to see debt rise above 40% of GDP (which would breach the sustainable investment rule), Brown says this is a matter for the pre-budget report. But he says these are \"quite unique times\", suggesting that the government will rewrite the rule.</p> <p><strong>Recover/election</strong></p> <p>Joe Murphy asks Brown when the recovery will start, and whether he will rule out an election next year.</p> <p>Brown refuses to answer on both counts.</p> <p><strong>Racism in the police</strong></p> <p>Brown says any racism is unacceptable. But he does not say whether he thinks the problem is getting worse.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p>Brown says the new Pakistani president will be visiting Britain soon.</p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong></p> <p>A Chinese journalists asks about the new regulations preventing certain categories of workers coming to Britain (like care home assistants).</p> <p>Brown defends the new points system.</p> <p>Where people are in the country and vulnerable, the government will protect them from exploitation.</p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>An Australian journalist says the Australian PM, Kevin Rudd, has ruled out increasing troop numbers to Afghanistan.</p> <p>Brown says he has spoken to Rudd about this. America, France and Britain are increasing troop numbers.</p> <p>Was Brown disappointed, she asks again?</p> <p>No, Brown says.</p> <p>Brown says everyone has now had a question. \"It's good to see you again,\" he says on the way out. Not sure he means it.</p> <p><strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>The relaunch message:</strong> Anyone expecting a new message from the prime minister to accompany the autumn relaunch will be disappointed. There was no admission that he might have made mistakes in the past, no contrite tone, no renewed emphasis on cabinet government. Instead he reaffirmed, as he had done endlessly before, that he is taking the right long-term decisions for Britain. If message discipline was the only thing that mattered in politics, Brown would be unbeatable.</p> <p><strong>Energy package:</strong> A substantial package, that Brown defended well. But Brown (and Hutton) could not explain how they were sure that the costs would not be passed on to customers. There was some strong language about dealing with market abuses - Hutton at one point said the government would come down \"like a ton of bricks\" on companies engaged in anti-competitive packages - but it's up to Ofgem to decide whether there are abuses. </p> <p>Brown also would not be drawn on what would happen if the Labour conference votes for a windfall tax. Presumably because the answer is embarrassing - he will ignore them, which is what the Labour leadership normally does when conference votes against it.</p> <p><strong>Brown's economic rules:</strong> It sounds as if they're about to be written. Asked if he was still committed to keeping debt below 40% of GDP, Brown said we would have to wait until the pre-budget review. But he referred to \"quite unique times\", which sounds as if he's preparing an alibi for tearing up the sustainable development rule, the one dealing with 40%.</p> <p><strong>Glenrothes byelection:</strong> Brown would not commit himself to visiting the constituency again, after the writ is moved and when campaigning starts in earnest, but he said that he went last week. Will this be his only visit, allowing him to refute claims that he has stayed away?</p> <p><strong>Responsibility/blame:</strong> Brown at least twice said he was taking responsibility for what the government has been doing. This seems to be the formula he will use when asked if he personally has contributed to the government's woes.</p> <p><strong>Confidence in Sir Ian Blair:</strong> Brown said had had full confidence in Sir Ian Blair, the embattled Met police chief. Blair will be grateful. But, realistically, he could not have said anything else.</p> <p><strong>E.ON boss:</strong> Brown was very critical of Mark Owen-Lloyd, the E.ON boss, who joked that a cold winter would be good for profits. Brown's remarks will probably go down well with Labour MPs, but they would still prefer a windfall tax. </p>",

  "<p>Two days after Thailand's prime minister was forced to stand down over a television cookery show, his party chose him again today to assume the role of the country's top job.</p> <p>Samak Sundaravej's ruling People Power party (PPP), which commands a large majority in the governing coalition, put him forward as their choice for prime minister - a nomination he accepted.</p> <p>Parliament is due to meet tomorrow to choose a new leader after Samak, 73, was forced to quit when the constitutional court decided that by hosting four cookery shows while in office he had breached rules barring ministers from having business links.</p> <p>The five smaller parties in the governing coalition that took office seven months ago had agreed to endorse the PPP's choice for leader. </p> <p>The decision to put Samak forward is bound to prove controversial as it breaks the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.</p> <p>If the former television chef and irascible rightwinger is elected, it is likely to cause further uproar among opponents. They had tried for months to get him to resign, accusing him of corruption and of being a puppet of the deposed former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.</p> <p>Thaksin, who fled to England with his family to escape a raft of corruption charges, remains an influential powerbroker within the PPP which assumed the mantle of his disbanded Thai Rak Thai party. He held telephone discussions with party bosses yesterday as they wrangled over their choice for prime minister.</p> <p>The selection of Samak is likely to inflame the thousands of People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) demonstrators who have occupied the prime minister's compound for more than two weeks. Clashes between PAD activists and government supporters provoked Samak to declare emergency rule.</p> <p>Thailand's army chief, Anupong Poachinda, today urged the caretaker government led by the acting prime minister and Thaksin's brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat, to lift the state of emergency as it was damaging Thailand's image.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/10/8\">Guardian</a> reported that the intelligence and security committee (ISC) has shelved a report into possible intelligence failures prior to the July 2005 London bombings. No one should hold their breath waiting for the ISC to get to the bottom of anything. Neither should anyone pass out waiting for Gordon Brown to implement genuine reform of anything. </p> <p>The new report appears to have been delayed for understandable legal reasons. The ISC section of the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/intelligence\">Cabinet Office website</a> has for some time carried a statement explaining that there are issues around reporting restrictions. Not that those government sources who have played up the evidence against the alleged \"airline plotters\" worry about prejudicing a potential retrial.</p> <p>Richard Norton-Taylor and Vikram Dodd correctly describe the ISC as consisting of senior peers and MPs, rather than as a \"parliamentary\" committee. The distinction has been one of significant debate recently, with the ISC's lack of independence from government criticised, as well as its tardiness in publishing its reports.</p> <p>In July, the Commons discussed the ISC's report for 2006/7 (yes, really), which had been published in January. It also passed two resolutions approving minor changes to the ISC after <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page15102\">Brown had announced</a> in March: \"We will immediately go ahead to introduce a resolution of both houses \u2013 in advance of any future legislation \u2013 that will enshrine an enhanced scrutiny and public role for the intelligence and security committee.\"</p> <p>It doesn't look like there is going to be any legislation. Brown's changes are too half-hearted to require it. Appointments to the committee will still be made by the prime minister, following nominations from parliament. The ISC may get office space outside the Cabinet Office and may have investigators again after <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article461463.ece\">a previous one was sacked</a> for blowing the whistle over the dossier. </p> <p>There may be a few public briefings, by ministers and the heads of intelligence agencies, but not proper public hearings. And the chair of the committee, rather than a minister, will open debates when the Commons eventually gets to discuss ISC reports, after the prime minister has sat on them for a while and censored them.</p> <p>The message seems to be that the ISC will parody a Commons committee but cannot ever be one. Spooks who are up to no good will hardly be trembling in their trenchcoats. The government batted away calls for proper parliamentary oversight and public hearings with claims like this one, from the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/constitutional-renewal-white-paper.pdf\">Governance of Britain White Paper (pdf)</a>: \"the independence of the cross-party ISC rests on its ability to draw on its access to sensitive information when compiling its reports.\"</p> <p>So the question is: If the ISC is so independent and gets such good information, why does it never get to the bottom of anything that is really uncomfortable for the government? Was it told that MI6 had received intelligence before the Iraq war from high-level sources, such as Tahir Jalil Habbush, who <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4466512.ece\">said that Saddam did not have weapons of mass destruction</a>? </p> <p>Was it given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/iraq.iraq\">documents</a> that, according to the information commissioner, could show that the ministers and officials sexed up the <a href=\"http://iraqdossier.com\">Iraq dossier</a>?, manipulating and exaggerating intelligence to strengthen the case for war? If it was, why have we had to find out these things by other means?</p> <p>By way of an update, the Cabinet Office has not yet released the secret documents or said whether it will appeal to the information tribunal. It seems that Gordon Brown wants the appearance of transparency with none of the uncomfortable consequences.</p>",
  "<p>A Lebanese politician died when his booby-trapped car exploded in hills east of the capital, Beirut, yesterday.</p> <p>Sheik Saleh Aridi, a senior member of the Lebanese Democratic party, had been trying to reconcile rival factions within the Druze community, a minority Muslim sect split along pro- and anti-Syrian lines. </p> <p>Police said the bomb that killed him was planted in his car in the village of Baissour. It was the first Lebanese political assassination in about a year. </p> <p>Lebanon - particularly the Beirut area - has experienced a period of relative calm since late May, when an agreement was signed in Doha, Qatar, to end street fighting that claimed at least 65 lives.</p> <p>On Monday, rival parties in the northern city of Tripoli signed a reconciliation deal to end the deadly fighting that had persisted there.</p> <p>The prime minister, Fuad Siniora, contacted Druze leaders and joined them in calling for calm after Aridi's assassination. </p> <p>Six other people were injured in the explosion, which happened as the politician got into his Mercedes in front of his home in the Druze-populated hills near the resort town of Aley. </p> <p>Police said an explosive charge was stuck under the car's body below the driver's seat and blew up as the vehicle started. Officials believe it was triggered either by remote control or a motion sensor.</p> <p>The US expressed its concern over the bombing and said its support of the Lebanese government was \"unwavering\". The bomb's target was unusual - Aridi, like his party, backed Syria, which has long dominated politically divided Lebanon. </p> <p>Most victims of political assassinations have opposed Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, most notably the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri. </p> <p>Hariri's killing, which happened in 2005, triggered the \"cedar revolution\" that led to the departure of Syrian troops from Lebanon.</p> <p>Lebanon's political impasse between pro- and anti-Syrian factions boiled over into fighting in Beirut and the Druze hills earlier this year. </p> <p>Shia fighters from the Syrian-backed Hizbullah overran Sunni pro-government strongholds and fought an anti-Syrian Druze faction in the region where the bomb went off last night. </p> <p>An Arab-brokered agreement in Doha calmed the situation, leading to the election of a new president and the formation of a national unity cabinet. </p> <p>Nazih Abu Ibrahim, a colleague of Aridi in the party's political bureau, said the aim of the assassination was to rekindle violence between rivals in the Druze community.</p> <p>The Druzes are split into two main factions - the Lebanese Democratic party, led by Talal Arsalan, and the Progressive Socialist party of Walid Jumblatt. Arsalan is allied to Hizbullah and Jumblatt is a prominent leader of the anti-Syrian camp.</p> <p>\"It was a bloody message,\" Ibrahim said on Hizbullah's al-Manar television, noting that the conciliatory atmosphere of recent weeks had prompted party officials to relax security measures.</p> <p>Since the fighting in May, the two leaders have worked towards reconciliation within the Druze sect. </p> <p>Aridi was a key middleman between the two sides and helped mediate an end to the fighting between Hizbullah and Jumblatt's men in the region around his hometown.</p>",
  "<p>It's an international publishing phenomenon, riding high in bestseller lists across the continent, and selling more than 1.2m copies in France, but there's no clue on the cover to the French origins of Muriel Barbery's The Elegance of the Hedgehog. Fiction in translation is not an easy sell to us Brits, and French fiction is perhaps the hardest sell of all.</p> <p>Barbery's novel, which takes as its unprepossessing subject an ugly, plump concierge and a 12-year-old girl who plans to commit suicide on her 13th birthday, has spent 102 weeks on the bestseller lists in France - longer than Dan Brown. Prickly like its title, funny yet tragic, the book opens bleakly, with concierge Ren\u00e9e and 12-year-old Paloma trapped in the loneliness of their lives, their fierce intelligence setting them apart from the fellow inhabitants of their apartment block. Winner of the Prix du Rotary International in France, it was published last week in the UK, and hopes are modest, to say the least.</p> <p>\"I think it's a great book but it's going to struggle a bit in the UK,\" says Jonathan Ruppin, promotions buyer at independent bookshop Foyles. \"The British reading public are unduly wary of foreign fiction. And the plot is not the main aspect of this book - it's more subservient to philosophical and sociological observations, and I find with the UK market now the plot is what people want more than anything else. Something esoteric and tricksy is difficult to sell.\"</p> <p>The book's translator Alison Anderson, a novelist in her own right, is largely in agreement. \"It's popular in France because this is a story where people manage to transcend their class barriers. The general attitude in France is that people feel very stuck there, they don't feel energised, [so] to see the way that Ren\u00e9e manages to overcome her background and be very educated and erudite is important to French people \u2026 In England, it's hard to say. The Francophiles will love it, and it does take the piss out of the French, [but] a lot simply won't get it.\"</p> <p>Published in France by the venerable Gallimard, L'\u00e9l\u00e9gance du h\u00e9risson was overlooked by the UK's major publishing houses until British rights were eventually acquired by tiny publisher Gallic Books, which specialises in French translations. \"It will be very interesting to see how it does in the UK,\" says managing director Jane Aitken. \"It is a book that some people get very excited about and I think there will be an uplift here, but it can't sell as well as in France. It is a very French subject and is set in the heart of Paris.\"</p> <p>Barbery herself admits that the novel is not a light read \u2013 in fact, she says that when it was published in August 2006, she thought nobody would read it. \"It's not an easy book, some subjects are not very popular and my style is complex,\" she says. \"But I was just very happy to have been able to write a second novel so I was thinking forward to the future. And then it happened - and I'm still completely surprised. I can't explain the book's huge success. I haven't changed my mind about the book: I'm happy to have written it but I don't think it has anything extraordinary or outstanding. And the main thing is that I don't want to know why it worked. The worst question a writer can ask himself is: what will work?\"</p> <p>If The Elegance of the Hedgehog fails to take off here, Barbery will be in good company. Michel Houellebecq might have acquired a cult following amongst trendily intellectual British readers today, but he was published to general indifference until Atomised brought him to the UK's attention. \"And it was the notoriety of Atomised which broke him here,\" points out Foyles's Ruppin, \"as opposed to the quality of his writing.\" The look of his novels \u2013 complete with scantily clad young women, in comparison to the pained-looking men on his French jackets - Ruppin continues, also emphasises the \"machismo, even misogyny\" in his writing over his loftier themes.</p> <p>Ruppin also points to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Beigbeder, a high-concept fiction writer who sells very well in his native France, but hasn't really managed more than a minor cult following over here, and successful French crime writer Sebastian Japrisot who he says \"struggled over here as [his UK publisher] Harvill were just a little too far ahead of the current vogue for continental crime\". </p> <p>The prolific and multiple prize-winning Belgian writer Am\u00e9lie Nothomb, and Anna Gavalda's novels (her latest La consolante is number six in France) have also failed to find a wide UK readership. \"My biggest surprise is that some of the major French writers are not translated into English - Pierre M\u00e9rot, Jean-Marie Laclavetine, Patrick Modiano,\" says Paul Fournel from the Institut Fran\u00e7ais du Royaume-Uni.</p> <p>\"Very little is translated [into English] but it's hard to pin it to something perceivably French,\" says Michael Sheringham, Marshal Foch professor of French literature at All Souls College in Oxford. \"Perhaps it's all a bit cerebral, which is maybe not what we want \u2026 Some people feel French cinema is all about watching paint dry, and in [some French books] books not a lot happens.\"</p> <p>Maybe it's the very structure of French novels, their introspective nature, their subtlety, which put off British readers. The self-referential device of the \"author as character\" recurs frequently in French fiction - see Annie Ernaux's L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement (Happening), a brooding retelling of a time in the author's past when she had an abortion; Eric Reinhardt's Cendrillon (Cinderella), the story of four men - one the author - with troubled relationships with their fathers; or Am\u00e9lie Nothomb's Stupeur et tremblement (Fear and Trembling), an autobiographical novel about a year working in Japan \u2013 but is rare in British writing.</p> <p>Anderson has translated Nothomb's latest French bestseller Ni d'\u00c8ve ni d'Adam (another autobiographical novel set in Japan), which is published in the US later this year as Tokyo Fianc\u00e9e but as yet has no UK publication date. \"In America people know of her but she's not hugely successful. Perhaps this is because her writing is a little harder, a bit more subtle - her language and the humour is certainly very subtle,\" suggests Anderson. \"In the US they want more of a story - everything is very plot-driven - and Am\u00e9lie Nothomb is quite subtle and not about the plot.\"</p> <p>Ruppin believes that the most important thing for the majority of British readers is storyline, and the ability to empathise with protagonists in the story. \"Being asked in our fiction to question the whole premise of our culture is not necessarily what we're looking for, whereas maybe the French are. The clich\u00e9 is of a man in a beret with a cigarette and red wine deliberating the meaning of life deep into the night \u2013 that's not the British way.\"</p> <p>Aitken says that the wealth of new titles published in English \u2013 more than 115,000 in 2007 - makes it hard for translated works to make an impact. \"It's also hard because a lot of the bestseller list is driven by the Orange prize and Richard &amp; Judy, so French authors are often excluded,\" she says.</p> <p>The biggest French hit in the UK in recent years has been Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky's posthumously published Suite Fran\u00e7aise, about the German occupation of France, which was shortlisted for the British Book Awards' Book of the Year in 2007. But contemporary French literature still struggles to find a readership.</p> <p>\"From our experience crime has done best,\" says Aitken, whose bestselling series at Gallic Books is Claude Izner's historical crime fiction, Murder on the Eiffel Tower, The P\u00e9re-Lachaise Mystery and The Montmartre Investigation. \"Humour can also sell well; in the end it's probably just good stories. Some French fiction can appear introspective \u2013 if something's introspective, and you're not getting sympathy for the characters, it can be off-putting.\"<br> She points out that initial signs are positive for The Elegance of the Hedgehog, with a welter of glowing reviews on Amazon.co.uk. \"Heartrending yet marvellous,\" writes one reviewer. \"Piquant philosophising,\" writes another.</p> <p>\"Will English and American people like [it]? Nobody can tell,\" says Barbery. \"I only know one thing: people and some friends said to me that a difficult book, even if some aspects of it are very accessible, won't find many readers. I never think like that. I deeply respect the reader and I have faith in his mind. After that, it's a question of taste: people will either like my universe, my characters, my style, or they won't.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008.

Expect Ince to hand Mike Ashley his resignation in a year's time after being told he'll only be allowed to sign players with the letter Q in their name.</p> <p>You see <strong>Sheffield United's attempts to sign Michael Brown on loan</strong>? Yeah? Well, they've been blocked. And Gareth Southgate <strong>won't let Rhys Williams leave Boro either</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile at Anfield, Tom Hicks and George Gillett have been up all night with their <strong>Big Book Of Dead Hard Sums</strong> and reckon Liverpool \u2013 the club not the city \u2013 is worth \u00a3750m. Sheikh Mohammed's about to laugh in their faces though: he's got a GCSE in maths and won't pay more than \u00a3450m \u2013 mainly because <strong>Jamie Carragher is being lined up as Liverpool's next manager</strong>.</p> <p>Another man who's going to do a bit of shopping, is Little Mickey Owen. Distressed that he's been left out of the squad for future World Cup winners England, he's going to spend \u00a312m on a house in Spain. The Daily Express practically messes in its pants while describing his new home in a double page spread. Check this out:</p> <p>\"It can only be entered through electronically controlled gates [Mickey will need one of those bleeper things to get in his garage] specially made of high-quality Arabic ironwork [they'll be made of metal] \u2026 A sentry will stand guard in a box outside the property night and day [a man in a hat on eight euros an hour will sit in a Portakabin watching telly and looking bored] \u2026 the estate's main villa resembles a set from Lawrence of Arabia [it's made of cardboard].\"</p> <p>Sounds like Mickey's been done to us.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Feel free to leave your football-related tittle tattle in our comment section below ...</p>",

  "<p>At last Friday's <a href=\"http://2008.dconstruct.org/\">dConstruct</a> conference in Brighton, I made the case for developing a stronger relationship between the games and the web developement communities. In a town where there are five major, international game development studios (Black Rock/Disney, (nope, not NCSoft...), Relentless, Zoe Mode and Club Penguin, plus virtual worlds developers Linden Lab), there were only a dozen or so representatives in the 800 + audience. </p> <p>Developers, developers, developers: the web people are keen to know how you do it. They want to know what makes your products sticky. They want to integrate your mechanics into their designs to create better user experiences and better products. And they want to talk to you.</p> <p>But every time I've suggested to games people that they meet up with the weberati - an industry that has a far more mainstream and accepting audience than interactive entertainment, mind - I get a slap. Apparently games people don't <em>want</em> to know what tricks they can integrate into their products that might make them more compelling to the billions of non-gamers the world over. Any suggestions as to why?</p> <p>But those same hungry web people are on the case; they're breaking down the theory of play and are creating websites that integrate the systems integrated into games development without games devs' help.</p> <p>Check out the competition, folks. Just imagine the new summits of entertainment that could be reached if the twain would meet!</p> <p>Examples over the fold.<br><br>Although games development seems to be a black art driven by a qualitative 'it just feels right' mentality (rather than, say, empirically-driven user testing, which is how the web tends to do it), there are three systems which devs incorporate into their products. They may just not realise it.</p> <p><strong>Controlled Systems</strong><br>These are the bits that designers actually build into the games. They are the explicit gamey things.</p> <p>First, Games folks design their games to dangle carrots in front of players' eyes. Think 'Our Princess is in another castle' from Super Mario Bros. Games provide regular feedback at regular intervals, building the play experience into a crescendo. And then, just as they think they're going to take the cake, the designs steal their lunch money, promising that they'll get it if they contribute just a little bit more.</p> <p>Now, the web does this too - it asks people to give and give and give of themselves for the promise of something in return. It may not be as sexy as a princess in a castle, but a classic example is the registration form: give me your details and I'll give you something in return. The further users get into a site before they have to give something up, the more the user is likely to give it up. That's called cognitive dissonance, for those with a psychological bent.</p> <p>Second, games developers are obsessed with creating openness. The objective is to allow the player to <em>believe</em> that they are able to go into every location, do everything that they can see, engage with everyone they meet. There's a classical difficult balance here - tites like GTA San Andreas and Tomb Raider 3 were criticised for their excessive openness -but open games are more interesting to players than games on 'rails'</p> <p>Anyone who's ever wandered the web knows that the internet is openness taken to the Nth degree. Rabbit holes run awfully deep in there. And so, like in games, the challenge for web developers is to create the funnels through which people can explore while allowing users to drft off the path occasionally. Games do have an easier time of it, of course, with things like stories, but clever web devs can do it too.</p> <p><strong>Enabling Systems</strong><br>The second set of systems are the emergent systems enabled by the creations of the game designers. </p> <p>Most important is community. It's the buzzword of both the web and the game worlds. In games, it's is built out of interpersonal interaction based around a property. Games devs create senses of belonging between people who share a comon understanding for the content of the games.</p> <p>When it comes to digitalia, the web did it first. Now, with sites like Digg and other socially-oriented services (hey! Web 2.0!), they're just making it more explicit.</p> <p>Out of community comes social value, and the features, brands, characters - and stories - that are genrated by the communities based on those things developed by the designers. Games designers create the assets owned by the community that community members subsequently trade on. eBay's category 1645, the real-money transfer for virtual goods, is this taken to the extreme. The real-world value that has emerged around accounts, relics, assets were enabled by the economic systems established by the developers themeselves. </p> <p>Websites don't have to create a brand or an economy to fulfil this system, think again: A Million Penguins, World Without Oil, those irritating Facebook zombies, Find Satoshi: these are just some of the websites that are encouraging user-generated ludic systems, and this is where the web shines.</p> <p><strong>Psychological Systems</strong><br>The last set of systems are psychological: the ones which reach into the core of the player and keep him (or her) coming back for more. </p> <p>Collecting things is a good example of this: it encourages self-motivation, self-challenge and self-efficacy. I <em>can</em> achieve by getting all the coins, killing all the bad guys, racing all the tracks. The web has obsessively focussed on this, creating points and ratings systems that are supposed to encourage people to come back for more. And like reward cards in supermarkets, they are able to create a brand relationship. This same approach can be used to encourage people to wander the web in more critical and filtered ways. And instead of collecting coins, you're collecting knowledge instead.</p> <p>But the most important of these is the carefully constructed avatar, the online identity that leads the player through the game. A trend in the games industry is to create characters that develop and adapt into unique characterisations as they go through actions and activities, like the leads in Deus Ex, Black and White and Fable, and even Lara Croft in her later Tom Raiders. A role playing game element in character development is imbuing the greater games industry, with the effect that over time the player recognises that his or her actions are having an observable impact on the game itself.</p> <p>This isn't an impossible feat in the web industry. In fact, it happens more than you think: profiles! Or tying identities together using OpenID! Or other ways (like Metaplace, for example) which allow users to integrate their existing selves across the various platforms so they can develop their unique web profile that is based upon them and their activities.</p> <p>These are the three systems which games folks integrate into their development, and far from wandering in the dark, web people are taking it upon themselves to integrate them into their own designs. The result is a compelling internet which has the potential - with the support of games developers and their ideas - to create something new and beautiful indeed.</p> <p>For more on the other side, check out <a href=\"http://infovore.org\">Tom Armitage's</a> recent talk at NLGD: <a href=\"http://infovore.org/talks/playing-together-what-games-can-learn-from-social-software/\">What games can learn from social software</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Seventy years ago this month in Munich, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, signed a document that allowed Germany to grab a large chunk of Czechoslovakia. The so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/history.secondworldwar\"> Munich Agreement</a> would come to be seen as an abject betrayal of what Chamberlain termed \"a far-away country of which we know little\". But that was not what many people thought at the time. </p> <p>Chamberlain's belief that Britain was not yet ready for war with Nazi <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/travel/germany\">Germany</a>, and that diplomacy and compromise were safer options, was in fact shared by many Europeans, who knew from personal experience the horrible consequences of war. Nonetheless, Chamberlain has gone down in history as a coward, and his \"appeasement\" of Nazi Germany is often blamed for Hitler's subsequent campaign to conquer the rest of Europe. </p> <p>Chamberlain was probably wrong. Britain and France could have stopped Germany. \"Munich, 1938,\" was one of the rare occasions in the history of democracies when careful diplomacy was a mistake. What was needed was a bloody-minded romantic hero, willing to gamble the fate of his nation by fighting on, \"whatever the cost may be,\" in the words of Winston Churchill. </p> <p>George Santayana famously warned that \"those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" History, however, teaches many lessons, some of them contradictory, and is never repeated in quite the same way. Sometimes too much attention paid to the past can lead us badly astray. So, what, exactly, has the world learned from Munich, 1938? </p> <p>If anything, west Europeans after the second world war drew conclusions that were closer to Chamberlain's thinking in 1938 than Churchill's. After two catastrophic wars, Europeans decided to build institutions that would make military conflict redundant. Henceforth, diplomacy, compromise, and shared sovereignty would be the norm, and romantic nationalism, based on military prowess, would be a thing of the past. </p> <p>Out of the ashes of war a new kind of Europe arose, as did a new kind of Japan, which even had a pacifist constitution (written by idealistic Americans, but gratefully accepted by most Japanese). Nationalism (except in football stadiums) gave way to smug self-satisfaction at having found more civilised, diplomatic, and pacific solutions to human conflicts. </p> <p>To be sure, the peace was kept. But only because it was guaranteed by the United States, which still stuck to pre-second world war notions of national and international security. </p> <p>In the US, Munich has had a very different resonance. There, it fed the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/1965/jan/25/secondworldwar.past\">Churchillian</a> illusions of many a \"war president\" who dreamed of going down in history as freedom's heroic defender. Munich has been invoked over and over \u2013 to fight Communism, to topple Saddam Hussein, to stop Iran, and to wage a \"war on terror\". </p> <p>These different perspectives have caused peculiar tensions between the US and its democratic allies. Europeans and Japanese depend on American military power for their security, but often don't like the way the US uses it. Too much dependence has also had an infantilising effect. Like permanent adolescents, Europeans and Japanese crave the security of the great American father, and deeply resent him at the same time. </p> <p>There is little doubt that the US, like all great powers, has embarked on foolish wars and acted like a bully, especially toward nations in its own hemisphere. But, even without invoking the ghosts of Munich, there are occasions when military force is the only way to deal with a tyrant. Europeans were unwilling to stand up to Serbian mass murderers. The Americans (after initial reluctance) had to do the dirty work. When the US decided to push Saddam Hussein's killers out of Kuwait, German protesters screamed that they would never \"shed blood for oil\". </p> <p>On the other hand, European diplomacy has had some remarkable successes. The prospect of joining the European Union helped consolidate democracy in central and eastern Europe, and in Turkey, too. Some of these democracies have joined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\">Nato</a>, and others desperately want to. Nato, however, unlike the EU, is a military organisation. Therein lies Chamberlain's old problem: are Europeans prepared to fight wars on behalf of their fellow members? </p> <p>During the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/politics.roundupreviews\">Cold War</a>, this was not a serious dilemma. Europeans relied on Nato and the US to defend them in case of Soviet aggression. Now Georgia and Ukraine would like to expect that Europeans and Americans would shed blood to defend them against Russia. </p> <p>The choice is stark: if Europeans are prepared to fight for Georgia or Ukraine, these countries should be invited to join Nato. If not, not. But, instead of choosing, major European countries such as Germany, have dithered, first dangling Nato membership as a juicy carrot, and then withdrawing the offer, leaving the Americans to indulge in heroic rhetoric without the necessary follow-through. </p> <p>All this is making the western alliance look incoherent, and, despite its vast wealth and American military power, strangely impotent. It is time for European democracies to make up their minds. They can remain dependent on US protection and stop complaining, or they can develop the capacity to defend Europe, however they wish to define it, by themselves. </p> <p>The first option may not be feasible for very much longer in the twilight days of Pax America. The second will be expensive and risky. Given the many divisions inside the Union, Europeans will probably muddle on, until a serious crisis forces them to act, by which point it could well be too late. </p> <p>Ian Buruma is Professor of human rights at Bard College.
