  "<p>I remember when the cats came, sighs Katie Moulton wistfully. That was quite exciting ...</p> <p>We are sitting on reception in a Travelodge in Scunthorpe, an unprepossessing building in a retail park, next to a McDonalds drive-through. Its around 3.30pm and its fair to say the place is hardly heaving. Moulton, a graduate trainee, her boss Carly and I are waiting for someone to arrive. For anything to happen. Anything at all.</p> <p>But what is all this about cats? These people came to check-in with pushchairs and I peeked over and one of them miaowed at me and they were two Bengal cats. Apparently pushchairs are all the rage in the cat world, says Moulton. The furry guests were there for a cat show nearby and represent just some of the diverse guests your average Travelodge sees. In Scunthorpe they are mainly business people, weekend wedding parties and summer-holiday families. But today, though the hotel is fully booked, there is no activity whatsoever.</p> <p>Katie Moulton, 21, from Ibstock in Leicestershire is a graduate trainee with Travelodge. She finished her degree in international tourism at Lincoln University this year and has started the two-year trainee course. Moulton had already worked for the company as a part-time receptionist while studying so it was a natural choice for her. On completing the scheme Moulton will become a hotel manager at one of the chains 336 hotels across the UK and within four years she should be an area manager. Along the way shell do licensing courses and NVQs in leisure and retail.</p> <p>Moulton will be in the Scunthorpe hotel for three months before a three-month stint at Leeds Central and then somewhere else.</p> <p>It was always going to be the hotel industry as far as Moulton was concerned. When I was younger I started working at a health farm where my mum worked, she says, then I got part-time jobs with Premier Inns and Thistle, but the Travelodge scheme had a structure to it that she liked and she knew the quality of the company already.</p> <p>On a typical day shift Moulton will arrive at 8am and crack on with housekeeping. That is learning how to clean rooms properly for departs and stayovers. Cleaning a room is more challenging than you think, says Moulton, as she walks me around the place. The silly things like putting a duvet on actually take some time.</p> <p>There is a target time of 20 minutes for a depart and 10 minutes for a stayover, with a stringent set-list. In addition to general cleaning and sharp-as-a-tack bedmaking, curtains have to be hung dead straight, dust has to be non-existent, remote controls have to have batteries tested and lights must work. On the housekeeping run Moulton also sets up linen trolleys and deals with deliveries. Afternoons or late shifts such as this, she will be on reception. I love the late shift, she says, as I get to see more of the customers.</p> <p>Its the customers that do it for Moulton. When a prepaid couple finally arrive to check-in, she's all smiles and at-easeness, taking them through their options and completely ignoring the fact that they are clearly on an illicit mini-break. Enjoy your stay, she grins. I would love to own my own budget hotel chain one day, she tells me. And my emphasis would be on good customer service. It makes such a difference.</p>",

  "<p>Andris Nelsons is conducting a dozen widely ranging programmes in his first season as the City of Birmingham Symphony's music director, so by next June we should have a better sense of what this hugely talented young Latvian has brought to his new orchestra. This first concert, though, already suggests that the omens are very good, and that the deep impression Nelsons made in his earlier appearances with the CBSO were not misleading.</p> <p>He is a far more subtle and thoughtful interpreter than some of the publicity surrounding his appointment suggested. Characterised by some as an up-and-at-'em young conductor, capable of injecting huge energy and excitement into everything and everyone he conducts, he is actually a musician who takes immense care over detail, and over the precise proportioning of every formal shape. The opening of Wagner's Rienzi Overture here was exquisitely moulded, and the tension allowed to build with total naturalness until the final pages were joyously unbuttoned, yet still firmly under control. There was a similar arc to Bart\u00f3k's Miraculous Mandarin suite, with the fine-etched woodwind tracery just as impressively presented as the helter-skelter ending.</p> <p>Already, Nelsons seems different from his two Birmingham predecessors, Simon Rattle and Sakari Oramo, in one significant respect - he is a conductor who is at home in an opera house (he has been music director at Latvian National Opera for five years) and who thinks in theatrical terms. There was a vivid sense of drama here - not just in Wagner and Bart\u00f3k, but in his superbly sustained handling of Berlioz's Fantastic Symphony, whose central slow movement tests any conductor's powers of coherence. Nelsons made it a wonderfully diverting journey, finding new things to admire at every turn. There will be plenty more of those over the coming months and years.</p>",
  "<p>For the second consecutive year, St Helens took the direct route to the grand final by beating their closest rivals, Leeds. But there the similarities end, as this was a far more convincing victory than last year's 10-8 battle, and complacency may now be the greatest threat to Saints completing a second Super League and Challenge Cup double in three seasons.</p> <p>They were 26-4 up inside 57 minutes as James Roby collected a couple of simple tries, after the outstanding Leon Pryce had laid on the game-breaking score for Francis Meli early in the second half.</p> <p>It was Saints' defence that laid the foundations, however, frustrating Leeds to such an extent that they were left running around in circles on those occasions when they had not already squandered possession early in the tackle count.</p> <p>The Rhinos will have to improve on this performance even to reach Old Trafford, as the winners of tonight's elimination semi-final between Catalans Dragons and Wigan in Perpignan will fancy their chances at Headingley in next Friday's final eliminator - especially if Leeds's influential Kiwi full-back Brent Webb fails to recover from the ankle injury that forced him off late.</p> <p>After a three-day break in Madrid to recharge their batteries, St Helens reverted to the team which retained the Challenge Cup three weeks ago, with one notable absentee - Paul Sculthorpe, the former Great Britain captain and double Man of Steel who confirmed before the kick-off that he is retiring aged 30 after suffering a horrendous shoulder dislocation making his first tackle at Wembley.</p> <p>\"I'm obviously disappointed to go out in this way,\" said Sculthorpe, \"but there was definitely no chance I could carry on.\" The loose forward was told in mid-season that St Helens would not offer him a new contract and proposed moves to Salford and Wakefield fell through. Instead, he looks set to stay with Saints as a member of the backroom staff.</p> <p>However, Sculthorpe has been a peripheral figure at Knowsley Road for the last couple of seasons because of the succession of injuries that have blighted the closing stages of a wonderful career, so there was never any real danger that his absence last night would affect Saints unduly.</p> <p>So it proved, as they took the lead inside eight minutes with a strong contender for the try of the season. Jon Wilkin and Willie Talau handled superbly inside their own half to send Francis Meli charging down the left wing and after he was tackled the ball was spread thrillingly to the other flank, where Ade Gardner touched down, for the 30th time this season.</p> <p>Leeds quickly pulled level at 4-4 with a much less spectacular score, Danny McGuire picking up the scraps after Meli had failed to collect Kevin Sinfield's high kick. But Sinfield dragged a relatively simple conversion across the posts, and by half-time Saints were back in control with a 12-4 lead.</p> <p>Their second try also came down the right, with the Australian centre Matthew Gidley punishing some surprisingly slack Leeds defence, and Sean Long made Sinfield's bad miss look worse when he converted from near the touchline and then slotted a simple penalty.</p> <p><strong>St Helens</strong> Wellens; Gardner, Gidley, Talau, Meli; Pryce, Long; Graham, Cunningham, Hargreaves, Gilmour, Wilkin, Flannery.

  "<p>A year ago, Bristol were contemplating only their second campaign in the Heineken Cup. Today, they lie at the foot of the Premiership, without a victory in their opening three games having been exposed not just by a lack of quality brought on by budgetary restraint but by the law variations which were not designed to reward the west country club's conservative style of play.</p> <p>While Bristol need to rebrand themselves, Sale lie at the top of the table with a 100% record. They have yet to concede a try this season, even if they have failed to score one in their last two matches, and their greater discipline at the breakdown, exemplified by the way they kept the ball in the dying minutes, was a key difference between the sides.</p> <p>Sale should have taken the lead on three minutes after Dwayne Peel, being watched by the Wales attack coach Rob Howley, took a penalty quickly after Bristol had been blown away at a ruck. The Lions scrum-half ran 30 yards along the left wing before passing inside to Mathew Tait. The full-back ran to within five yards of the home line, only to see what would have been a scoring pass to Rory Lamont deflect off Luke Arscott towards touch.</p> <p>With the referee, David Rose, handing out penalties liberally, Peel's menace earned his side a one-man advantage after 16 minutes when Ed Barnes was sent to the sin-bin after his side, again, had been penalised at the breakdown and he threw the ball away from Peel's grasp. The home centre Neil Brew should have scored from a quickly taken penalty shortly after, but Rose could not award the try because, expecting a scrum, his back was to the play.</p> <p>Barnes's cynicism allowed Luke McAlister to open the scoring with a 45-yard penalty, but Bristol were level within five minutes when, after Brew's try was ruled out, Adrian Jarvis landed the short-range penalty. The constant stream of penalties meant the game lacked fluidity: that worked to Bristol's advantage with Sale looking the more threatening in broken play.</p> <p>Bristol lost their outside-half, Jarvis, at half-time and with it what little direction they had. They continued to concede penalties at the breakdown and, with McAlister kicking two long-range penalties to extend Sales' lead to six points, the home side's response was to kick for territory and play in safe areas.</p> <p>Bristol applied some sustained pressure in the final 11 minutes. Barnes cut the deficit with a 25-yard penalty, but squandered the opportunity to equalise from longer out.</p> <p><strong>Bristol</strong> L Arscott; T Arscott, Brew, Barnes, Lemi; Jarvis (Barden h-t), Beveridge (Thomas 78); Clarke, Linklater (Blaney 80), Hobson, Sambucetti (Winters 60), Budgett, To'oala (Pennycook 60), El Abd (capt), Ward-Smith.</p> <p>Pens Jarvis, Barnes.

  "<p>He started the day offering a fair impression of Captain Cool. He ended it sitting disconsolately in his buggy, surrounded by his downcast kids and presenting a group picture to the world that may only be described as The Glums. For Nick Faldo this was not how it had been planned.</p> <p>Back in his playing days he would have described it as \"a bad day at the office\". He could have said the same yesterday but only if that office was Lehman Brothers. The man who loves detail, who devours stats, had a new set of figures to look at and the bad news was writ large on the leaderboards that decorate the course.</p> <p>America, a team roundly criticised as their weakest yet, were in the ascendant and riding the momentum. Europe, so vividly superior in the old battle so far this century, were the ones needing to regroup. While the US captain, Paul Azinger, whooped and high-fived his way through the crowds, his great rival wore the weary look of a man who simply did not want to believe what was happening before his startled, weary eyes.</p> <p>This morning he will be stressing that this Ryder Cup is not over yet. And he will be right. But suddenly it is harder than he wanted. If he is to emerge victorious then it will be as the result of a serious fightback. This is good news for the contest, not so good for a man whose whole life has been dedicated to winning.</p> <p>All week Faldo has been accentuating the positive to his players. His mantra has been simple enough: \"Be positive, think positive, play positive. We can win this thing.\" After an adult lifetime spent coldly in total control of his own destiny, Faldo has had to give himself up to others. For him these are strange days indeed.</p> <p>Following all those years looking after No1, of denying the others and hugely irritating many of them, the Englishman seems to have discovered that it really can be better to give than to receive. In his case this giving takes the shape of arm-around support for his players. The guy who used to hold everyone off at arm's length is now suddenly in embracing mode.</p> <p>Rising well before dawn and overdosing on adrenalin, he was here, there and everywhere when the matches began. \"The atmosphere out there is great,\" he said during a rare pit-stop. \"The crowds are really fair. Unfortunately they are outnumbering us pretty heavily but I warned the guys that would be the case.\"</p> <p>As the matches embroidered their helter-skelter progress across Valhalla, Faldo started to pop up here, disappear and then re-emerge there. Beam me up captain. His job was to encourage, to inform and to work out if his plans for today needed to be changed. Plans, he is full of plans, but stuff happens, momentum shifts.</p> <p>Already this week has reduced this coldly detached man to tears. Specifically, the tear-jerker was Muhammad Ali but there is a lot else playing out here for Faldo. His third ex-wife is beside him, surplus to requirements at home but voted in as queen of the European wives and girlfriends this week. His parents, George and Joyce are here too. This may be Ryder Cup week but it is also showtime for Nicholas Alexander Faldo.</p> <p>From here on in, however, the screw tightens. In recent times captains like Seve Ballesteros and Ben Crenshaw have gone wonderfully barmy by the end of the second day. In Seve's case he started out quite nuts. Will Faldo? Well, the small signs of doolalliness are there if you look hard for them. Last night the European captain was just about clinging on to his sanity and preparing to go again today.</p>",
  "<p>That summer holiday may already be a distant memory, but some hazy recollection of glorious, sun-soaked interiors could be lingering. How about bringing some of that cool, glazed pattern into the bathroom or fireplace at home? Moroccan and Mediterranean patterned tiles are now widely available in the UK, and with a few expert tips, you can have a little exotic flair at home without displaying a single straw donkey.</p> <p>Here, we give you an essential guide to effectively using patterned decorative tiles in different settings, plus a sourcebook for where to buy them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Many of the most beautiful decorative tiles create a loud, rhythmic pattern across a large surface area. This can be striking - but also overwhelming. To prevent them dominating a room, and to keep down costs (individual tiles can be as much as \u00a320), think about using only six or eight as a splashback above a basin. Or displaying a neat column of four inside a fireplace's cast-iron insert. Or consider alternating them with plain white tiles.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Where to put them? \"These tiles look best framed, so set them in recesses or alcoves so they have a clear stop and start,\" says interior designer Gill Richardson, of Goodchild Interiors, \"or create a frame using wooden mouldings or architrave which you can paint.\" A splashback behind an oven. A bath panel. A chimney breast cavity. Or displayed symmetrically in a picture frame on the wall. Richardson adds: \"Use blue and white tiles to give a period feel in a kitchen by putting them behind a range or Aga. They can look great on chimney breasts, too - a sort of Gustavian take; if you're brave, use blue and white repeating motifs laid in a regular alignment that emphasises the shape of the breast.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep the rest of your scheme low-key, with grey or neutral walls, for example. Richardson suggests \"using arches and the Middle Eastern shapes you associate with these tiles within the space\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Moroccan tiles are handmade and look better laid without a space between them. \"Always draw up the pattern first, to give your installer a clear idea of what you want,\" Richardson says. Because the thickness of the tiles can vary, allow at least 5mm for the application of the adhesive. When laying them, place each tile very close together and use a soft, grey-coloured grout, rather than the brilliant white found in DIY shops. Once dry, treat like any other tile with just the occasional wipe-over with a damp cloth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Unlike modern, factory-made tiles, Moroccan tiles have tiny irregularities in shape, size and shade, giving a slightly unpolished, undulating finish to any surface. Go with it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some tiles will need sealing once they are laid: these include unglazed terracotta, limestone and slate tiles. Your supplier can advise you on this.</p> <h2>Where to find exotic tiles</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337801113\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/19/Tile4.jpg\" alt=\"Space feature\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tiles by TexTiles</strong><br>A large range of decorative wall tiles of all styles, from \u00a36 each.

  "<p>Notes on a Scandal is a narrative told in retrospect. You find out where events have led in its very first sentence: \"The other night at dinner, Sheba talked about the first time that she and the Connolly boy kissed.\" We are told this by Barbara, the 60-something history teacher with whom Sheba is living in the wake of a scandal. As the novel begins, middle-aged teacher Sheba Hart's affair with a 15-year-old pupil, Steven Connolly, has already become public. Sheba has been charged with \"indecent assault on a minor\"; her name, the narrator expects, \"will probably be familiar to most of you by now\". Barbara is going to tell us Sheba's story, lest we be deceived by the distortions peddled in the press. She is busy writing what we read. </p> <p>So there is a present tense to this narrative. \"It's getting on for six o'clock now, so it won't be much longer . . . Sheba will come down.\" The novel goes back to recount the slow development and disastrous consequences of Sheba's affair in the past tense. But most of its chapters begin in the present, with Barbara finding secret time to scribble her story. \"I'm writing this late on Saturday night. I should be in bed, but I haven't been able to get any writing done all week.\" </p> <p>Barbara strives to take possession of Sheba, and her composition of this narrative is her way of doing so. \"The task of telling it has fallen into my hands,\" she announces, with unconsciously comic solemnity. To ensure \"maximum accuracy in this narrative\", she constructs a \"timeline\" on graph paper of Sheba's time at the school and her affair. Teacher-like, she uses \"stick-on gold stars\" for \"truly seminal events\". She even has a \"schedule\" for her composition, to make sure that she gets every precious detail down in writing. This is a narrative being hatched, even as we read. Barbara is scribbling away as she listens for the sound of Sheba on the stairs. The rhythm with which the narrative returns to the present tense keeps reminding us of the narrator and her strange designs.</p> <p>\"This is not a story about me,\" says our narrator, but of course it is. It is the story of how Barbara schemes to acquire Sheba as her \"friend\". The evidence for Barbara's peculiarity must be gleaned from her own account. In a temper, Sheba reveals that her husband, Richard, has called Barbara an \"incubus\", and there are hints that she has what one might call a \"history\". Initially disappointed that Sheba befriends not her, but a \"terrifyingly dull\" colleague, Barbara recalls the \"very severe blow\" a few years previously \"when my friend Jennifer Dodd announced that she wanted no further contact with me\". The \"friend\" made \"some mysterious references to my being 'too intense'\". There are veiled references to \"certain personal difficulties that I experienced with staff members\" at the first school she ever taught in, and to the \"malicious gossip\" that she has suffered in staffrooms \"more than once in my career\".</p> <p>Barbara is determined to imagine herself into every recess of Sheba's life. So the novel describes many scenes where Sheba is present, but not Barbara. With an exact attention to words and gestures, we get the unfolding of Sheba and Steven's mutual seduction. Later we listen to them talking in bed together. More than this, we get Sheba's private fantasies. Barbara tells us how she responds when Steven, showing off to a yobbish schoolfriend, treats her scornfully. \"She registered a definite twinge of - what was it? Excitement? Titillation? For a split second, she found herself imagining what it would be like to lie beneath him; to have his hands on her.\" Those questions are supposed to be Sheba's secret thoughts.</p> <p>Partly this is explained by Barbara's role as Sheba's confessor. Sheba \"tosses out intimate and unflattering truths about herself, all the time, without a second thought\". She has the \"insouciant frankness\" that the narrator assumes is something to do with her \"upper-class\" background. There is no information too private to be told, and she and Sheba have spent \"countless hours together over the last eighteen months, exchanging confidences\". But it is more than this: Barbara \"knows\" what has gone on in Sheba's head, and we must depend upon her knowledge.</p> <p>Barbara's account becomes physically present in the novel. Usually, after each writing session, she hides the manuscript under her mattress. Sheba \"doesn't know about this project\" - it would only \"agitate\" her, explains Barbara, with characteristic mock-concern. Secret writings, of course, are destined to be discovered, and the crisis of this novel will come when Sheba finds and reads the narrative of her own disgrace. For then she realises what the novel's narration has already dramatised for us: the real story is not of her affair with the teenage Steven, but of her involvement with the weird and manipulative Barbara, the person who writes the story.</p> <p>John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.

  "<p>Five minutes ago, Emily Mortimer was Anna Karenina in Prada lace; before that, she was Holly Golightly in Balenciaga silk. But, for the minute, she is Emily, in a denim miniskirt and black T-shirt, perched on a stool and eating salad from a plate on her lap. I am about to launch into my first questions, which interview etiquette demands must be about the subject's latest project, in order to get this, the premise for the encounter, out of the way before getting down to the serious business of nosiness. By way of preamble, while I am still fiddling with my tape recorder, we are chatting about interviews in general. </p> <p>\"The thing about interviews,\" Mortimer says, \"is you know perfectly well people don't really want to listen to you bore on about your job. Even though that's supposedly what they're interviewing you about. There's a cursory few questions at the start when they politely ask about the film, but you know they're not going to put hardly any of it in. The article will be all personal stuff. And with the British media you have to be slightly on your guard because you know that the dopiest, most embarrassing thing you say will be the first thing they print, top of the page, in bold. So you end up presenting a kind of counterfeit version of yourself to the world, with soundbites and jokes.\" She stops, looks up from her salad and smiles her winning smile. \"Anyway! Do start.\" </p> <p>Touch\u00e9. As opening moves with which to wrong-foot nosy journalists go, this takes some beating. But then Mortimer has never been your average ditsy starlet. Her father, to whom she is extremely close, is Sir John Mortimer QC; she was studying English and Russian at Oxford when the agent mother of a friend spotted her in a student production of The Trial, and went on to cast her in a TV production of Catherine Cookson's The Glass Virgin. In her 20s, as well as carving out a lucrative niche playing (in her words) \"posh Sloanes\" - culminating in Perfect Girl, whom Hugh Grant meets at a W11 dinner party, in 1999's Notting Hill, she wrote a very funny fictional fortnightly column, An Actress's Life, for the Telegraph.</p> <p>It is not difficult to see why Mortimer kept getting cast as the English rose. There is something rather old-fashioned about her: the alabaster skin, hair that looks distinctly un-blow-dried, and head-girlish speaking manner. Today's vogue among young female celebrities is to converse with the press in a stream of anodyne faux-intimacies and half-baked pop-psychological theorising, all looped together with \"likes\" and \"y'knows\". Mortimer, by contrast, will begin a sentence (\"I think that...\") and then pause, leaving a silence in which you can sense her editing her words in her head, before committing them concisely to the tape recorder in that distinctive half-rasping, half-squeaky voice. </p> <p>Just under a decade ago, at the moment when she seemed pigeonholed playing nice posh girls, Mortimer's life changed tack. She ditched her prim image by appearing nude in 2001's Lovely &amp; Amazing and moved to LA, where she announced her arrival in Hollywood with roles opposite Bruce Willis (The Kid) and Samuel L Jackson (The 51st State). In January 2003 she married an American actor, Alessandro Nivola; their son, Sam, was born nine months later. </p> <p>Mortimer lived in LA for six years. Moving to a city she once called \"a beauty parlour at the end of the universe\" was a neat trick to escape being for ever John Mortimer's daughter. It was, as she puts it, \"nice to be somewhere where you are not defined by your background, by the school you went to. I have a fear of being defined, of being one thing. That feels deadly.\" There are, she says, \"lots of good things about LA. Where we lived in Echo Park, you can sit in your garden and see a hummingbird and a coyote, and at the same time there's a helicopter circling overhead after someone who's done something dastardly. It's all rather exotic.\" </p> <p>Like many bluestocking-ish women, Mortimer has a semi-secret fascination with the sunnier, shinier side of life represented by California and its girls. (One of her teenage passions was to watch ice dancing on television.) Nonetheless, the positivity of America can grate on her English sensibilities. \"I did an interview recently where the journalist put thousands of exclamation marks after everything I said. Most of the quotes that were attributed to me were things I had more or less said, but with all these exclamation marks, so it was all 'Martin Scorsese's so sweet!!!!!' Oh God, please don't let Martin Scorsese read that. I sound idiotic.\" </p> <p>After two years in LA, she says, it dawned on her \"that this might be my life, that I might never get home, that I might be an expatriate. Somehow I just didn't see it coming, which is actually quite thick of me considering I married an American.\" After \"railing against it\" for a while, she has made peace with her new life and is working towards joint citizenship, which she is hoping will come through before November so she can vote for Obama. Two years ago, she relocated to Brooklyn (\"very nice, a lot like Queen's Park\") primarily in order to be a few hours closer in flight time to her family, and particularly her father, who at 85 is no longer in robust health. </p> <p>It is her father to whom Mortimer owes her cheerfully unmodish taste in literature. Her favourite book is Great Expectations (\"terrifying, brilliant, heartbreaking\"); her dad, she says, is \"a Dickens nut\" and the taste rubbed off on her. When in need of airport or beach reading, she prefers the nursery-pudding jollity of PG Wodehouse to chick lit. \"In fact, this is embarrassing, but I have hardly read a book written after 1950. I'm reading Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook [1962] right now, and that's about as contemporary as I get.\" </p> <p>Her father's advocacy of prison reform - \"he always spoke very highly of murderers\" - has inspired her to volunteer at a women's prison in Brooklyn. \"I know it's not a sexy subject, prison reform. It's not starving children or polar bears, it's people who have fucked up. But to me it's a measure of civilisation, how we deal with prisoners - people who have no voice, who are not deemed worthy of respect. But I don't want to make it sound like I think I'm saving the universe or something. And I'm doing it partly for myself - it makes me feel more connected to America, doing something like this.\"</p> <p>This spring, Mortimer took a terrifying plunge into Manhattan life with a theatre role in Parlour Song, a play by Jez Butterworth. It was, she says, \"very, very scary - every single night\". She won rave reviews: the New York Times described her as \"a sly stunner\". She has not been slacking on the film work, either, and will soon have a slew of cinema releases. First comes Redbelt, which is \"a sports movie - like Rocky, but directed by David Mamet, and all about jujitsu\". Then there's Pink Panther 2, and Transsiberian, directed by Brad Anderson, which she says was great fun to film (\"when you're jumping between train carriages, you really feel like you're in a movie\"). And she has just finished Ashecliffe, a Scorsese film with Leonardo DiCaprio, which she loved \"because in a Scorsese movie everyone from the clapper loader to the costume designer is the absolute master of their art. It's a class act.\" Next up are roles opposite Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi. </p> <p>But while on the Paris set of Pink Panther 2, Mortimer had a humbling experience. \"There were all these very famous people in this film, but they'd all gone home. It was raining, and there was one lonely photographer standing outside the trailer. I had my curlers in and he papped me and I was thinking, 'Well, obviously this is outrageous and invasive but, gosh, I guess I've arrived.' And then the make-up girl, who was holding an umbrella over me to protect my hair from the rain, pulled it lower to shield my face from him. And the photographer - who was English - shouted really sarcastically, 'Yeah, like she's so fucking famous.' I thought, 'You can't do that! You can't pap me and then abuse me for not being famous enough!'\" It's a classic Mortimer soundbite: self-deprecating, crisply told and with a keen sense of the absurd. And on that note she is whisked off to make-up to be transformed, fittingly, into a modern-day Jane Austen heroine, dressed in Alexander McQueen.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I don't smoke. My husband smokes in the house but says there's no real evidence that secondhand smoke causes harm.</strong></p> <p>The latest evidence is so clear that even Forest, the pro-tobacco lobby, can't argue against it. After Scotland banned smoking in public places in March 2006, admissions to hospital for acute coronary attacks fell by 17%. In the same time, in England and Wales, where there wasn't yet a ban, the fall was only 4%. Crucially, the fall in admissions was greatest in people who had never smoked and in women - in other words, secondhand smokers who were no longer exposed to smoke. Their blood cotinine levels (the best measure of exposure to smoke) had fallen in line with the drop in heart attacks. No one could argue against a link between the two. </p> <p><strong>My wife has postnatal depression after our first baby. We have lots of support and she is recovering slowly, but we're worried about what may be ahead. How long will she be depressed, and will it return?</strong></p> <p>Most women with postnatal depression who respond to treatment recover completely. Some are susceptible to depression after childbirth: they have around 40% risk of another depressive episode after subsequent pregnancies, but it seems specific to pregnancy. They have a lower-than-usual risk of becoming depressed outside the context of pregnancy and birth. On average, postnatal depression lasts three to six months, although some women have a low mood for a year or more. You can both be optimistic: knowing these figures can help you plan, but follow your depression team's guidance in the meantime. </p> <p><strong>My dentist tells me that my plaque build-up is due to age-related blood chemistry changes.

Ask your GP for a blood test to check your biochemistry. The main correlates for cardiovascular risk are with high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, poorly controlled diabetes, obesity and lack of regular aerobic exercise.

  "<p>Stress was invented in 1936, when the Hungarian biologist Hans Selye defined it as \"the non-specific response of the body to any demand for change\". So while it would be unfair to blame Selye for the fact that modern life is so stressful, he does deserve some blame for the epidemic of articles about the \"stress epidemic\" - have you noticed how reading them stresses you out? - and for books such as Stress-Free In 30 Days, Stressproof Your Life, or The Complete Idiot's Guide To Overcoming Stress. (There's another book in that series, incidentally, called The Complete Idiot's Guide To Enhancing Self-Esteem: is that the most self-defeating self-help title ever?) In later life, Selye recanted: his English had been poor, he said and he hadn't meant to use the word \"stress\" at all. What he meant was something more like \"strain\".</p> <p>The distinction matters. Because of how we use the word \"stress\" colloquially - and how physicists use it, too - it brings to mind an external force: it implies that the problem is whatever things (stressors) are pressing on us from outside. \"Strain\" is more faithful to Selye's intended meaning, which is that the problem lies in how we respond to those forces.</p> <p>There's a certain comfort in thinking of stress as an external thing: it implies it's beyond your control, and so not your responsibility. It lets you feel busy, and may evoke sympathy; it relieves you of the obligation to change. But it also implies that the answer to reducing stress is avoiding that external thing. There's short-term relief in fleeing a stressful situation for a calm and peaceful one, but if the problem is really how we respond to \"stressful\" situations, that won't leave us better off next time. We're assailed by lifestyle suggestions promising stress reduction: blissful holidays, say, or downshifting to the country. But if you're using them to avoid things that trigger your negative responses, mightn't it be wiser to work on your responses instead?</p> <p>That's the question motivating the study of what psychologists call \"resilience\", the characteristics that cause some to thrive amid what others call stress. Amanda Ripley's new book, The Unthinkable, examines who survives when faced with natural disasters or terrorism, and who doesn't. It's largely a matter of beliefs: survivors are those who think they have some control over external circumstances, and who see how even a negative experience might lead to growth. (Overconfident people, who overestimate their powers, do particularly well.) By its very nature, \"thriving [in response to extreme stress] is a contradiction,\" Paul Pearsall says in The Beethoven Factor, his book about resilience. \"It is about becoming stronger and being devastated at the same time.\"</p> <p>Changing your beliefs is no mean feat. But just knowing that that's where stress is really located is a good start. That's not an argument for putting up with an insane job, relationship, or other circumstance. But it offers the possibility of making a choice - not getting submerged by stress, nor fleeing what triggers it, but doing what the Buddhist nun Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n, quoted here before, calls \"learning to stay\".</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Tough laws to force schools and education authorities to guarantee that teachers spend 10% of their time outside the classroom - preparing for lessons and marking - are to be introduced as part of a new offensive to win the \"hearts and minds\" of disenchanted public sector workers.</p> <p>Amid evidence that guidelines on teaching time are being flouted across the country, Ed Balls, the schools secretary, is to introduce a law that will allow him to intervene where rules are being ignored.</p> <p>It is one of the measures he outlines in a Guardian interview today that are designed to persuade teachers and the rest of the \"children's workforce\" - classroom assistants, dinner ladies and caretakers - to \"stick with\" Labour in the face of a \"starkly different\" approach from the Tories.</p> <p>Balls will use his speech at the Labour conference in Manchester to reach out to teachers to win their support for his wider education reforms. He will promise to:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Create a statutory independent chair to ensure that more than 300,000 teaching assistants and support staff are paid fairly</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Award pay rises for head teachers in high performing schools, possibly taking their salaries up to \u00a3200,000 a year, if they take on additional duties to help struggling schools</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roll out a system of masters for teachers to give them the same professional status as doctors and lawyers. This will be accompanied by tougher action against under-performing teachers.</p> <p>Balls hopes his plan will persuade the 2.8m people working with children to vote Labour and to support his educational reforms that will involve special help for failing schools. \"We need to win the hearts and minds of people working in the children's workforce,\" Balls says as he points out that two thirds of public sector workers did not vote Labour at the last election. </p> <p>\"It is important they stick with us because the alternative in terms of cuts in school building, a ripping up of the progress we have made with the trade unions in workforce reforms.\"</p> <p>Balls makes it clear that he is not simply caving into the demands of teachers and that he expects them in return to support his reforms which are designed to ensure that every school reaches the \"30% benchmark\" - 30% of pupils achieve five or more GCSEs at grade A* to C, including English and maths. </p> <p>\"This is about supporting reform and making sure that you can have the one to one tuition, the raising of standards, the changes in the structure of schools which we need,\" he said.</p> <p>Balls will underline his intention in his speech on Wednesday. He will say that it is time to introduce legislation to ensure that teachers are given proper time for preparation and marking.</p> <p>Under a national agreement signed in 2003, teachers were given a guarantee that 10% of their timetable should be allocated to preparing for lessons and marking; head teachers were given dedicated head teaching time; and newly qualified teachers were given time outside the curriculum for training. Balls says that one survey found a third of teachers are being denied their rights.</p> <p>Balls, who praises the NASUWT general secretary, Chris Keates, for her role in lobbying him on the need for action, says: \"We have got this agreement, it has got to be enforced. We will legislate in the next few months to give local authorities the power to issue a warning notice to a school which is not keeping to the provisions in the pay and conditions document. </p> <p>\"Where a local authority issues a warning notice it will be able to follow up, if necessary, by withdrawing the delegated budget for the school or putting in additional governors or even going all the way to an interim executive board.</p> <p>\"I as secretary of state will also take a power to require a local authority to consider a warning notice where a school is non-compliant. So if the school is not compliant and the local authority is not acting, I can say to them you've got to consider stepping in.\"</p> <p>In his speech Balls will also announce that he is to introduce legislation to set up an independent and statutory chair to ensure that 300,000 teaching assistants and support staff receive a fair deal. Balls acknowledged that this has been controversial - an increase in teaching assistants has been opposed by the NUT.</p> <p>But he says: \"In schools I visit heads and teachers say that teaching assistants are revolutionising the classroom and allowing teachers again to get on with teaching and to allow special education needs and behaviour issues to be addressed. </p> <p>\"There has always been an issue about the different way in which pay and conditions and progression for support staff has been done. An independent chair will recognise and strengthen the position of support staff within the school workforce.\"</p> <p>Balls, who has worked closely with the \"partnership unions\" such as the NASUWT, wants to reach out to teachers and other public sector workers to drive home the importance of supporting Labour at the next election. \"Maybe when you look at 2001 and 2005 it was easy because people thought there wasn't really going to be a chance for change. It wasn't something that really focused the minds of people working in schools and the children's workforce,\" he said.</p> <p>As the prime minister's closest ally in cabinet, Balls is playing a key role in shaping the leadership's attack on David Cameron which claims that he is hiding a \"red meat\" agenda of tax and spending cuts behind pretty pictures. This form of attack has been criticised by some ministers: a view Balls rejects.</p> <p>\"It is essential we understand what the Tories are doing. What [David Cameron] is doing is derivative from parties on the right and the left pretending to be centrist in means. It is an entirely dishonest political strategy.\"</p> <p>Balls highlighted the Tories' approach to his own area. \"We need to set out very starkly that the Conservatives offer a very different view of the education system. They oppose education to 18, they oppose diplomas, they oppose enforcement of the admissions code, they want to cut sure start, they want to cut building schools for the future [at a cost of \u00a34.5bn].\"</p>",
  "<p>I've seen some dumb things in my time. Take Die Hard 4.0. That's astronomically dumb; like being smacked in the face with a mallet made of super-compressed dumb. </p> <p>Merely watching it made me feel like a simpleton reading a Ladybird book on a dodgem. Then there's Bad Boys 2, which I didn't so much \"watch\" as \"catch glimpses of\" - it was showing on a plane while I kept intermittently nodding off: literally every time I opened my eyes a car was corkscrewing through the air in slow motion, surrounded by explosions, and I'd go back to sleep. It was dumb enough to sedate me.</p> <p>But these are Hollywood epics. It took millions of dollars and hundreds of hours of gruelling labour to create such monuments of transcendent stupidity, such overwhelming pyramids of thick. The BBC, brilliantly, has managed to bring us something equally (and shamelessly) dumb at a fraction of the cost. You'd glow with national pride, if only they hadn't done it by merely adapting a Japanese format.</p> <p>I speak, dear reader, of <strong>Hole In The Wall (Sat, 5.40pm, BBC1)</strong>, which is by far the stupidest gameshow I have ever seen. Just to be clear: in this context, \"stupid\" isn't necessarily an insult. It's so openly, obviously and knowingly stupid, the whole thing is virtually immune to criticism. It's the television equivalent of a gurgling jester repeatedly honking a horn.</p> <p>It's been described as \"human Tetris\", which it is. Each week, two teams of celebrity contestants go head to head. One-by-one, the players stand on a pad in front of a pool while a wall moves slowly toward them, ready to shovel them into the water. The wall has a hole in it. A person-shaped hole. The sort of hole Wile E Coyote would leave in the side of a cliff when blasted through it by a cannon. The contestant has to contort themselves into the right position, like a key going through a lock, so the wall can pass them by without knocking them into the drink.</p> <p>Just to make things stupider, the contestants are required to wear figure-hugging silver Lycra jumpsuits designed to be as humiliating as possible. One of the Hairy Bikers takes part this week; scarcely a moment goes by without someone cracking a joke about how big and wobbly he looks. All of them sport visibly crushed goolies or spectacular cameltoes. </p> <p>If you've ever wanted to see former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon lying on her back and hoisting her hips in the air, here's your chance - although be warned: in a bid to ward off potential masturbators, Anton Du Beke's standing in the background wearing a costume so tight his nuts are spread halfway across his pelvis, as though they've been buttered into position with an enormous pallet knife.</p> <p>Anyway, that's it. The first time you see the wall appearing and get a sense of how it works, I guarantee you'll laugh out loud. Then it happens again. And again. And again. And then you realise there's little or no variation: that's all that happens, for the full half-hour. You're watching celebrities being knocked into a pool, over and over, while the audience shrieks and applauds, and it all starts to resemble not just a dumb gameshow, but an almost nightmarishly dumb gameshow, the sort of gameshow you'd find in a dystopian science fiction film about an insane futuristic society. And you have to hold your head to quell the giddiness.</p> <p>That's how dumb it is.</p> <p>But really, so what? We've been here before. It's basically a Nintendo version of It's A Knockout. And, what's more, once you factor in the knowledge that the contestants are competing for charity, it looks less like the death of civilisation and more like a daft game at a village fete, writ large. </p> <p>This is TV blowing off and giggling for 30 unrelenting minutes. </p> <p>My only complaint is the variety of contestants: before the end of the series here's hoping that we'll get to see Simon Schama, Brian Sewell and Prince Philip adopting the position. And the Lycra.</p>",
  "<p>From Emma Bovary practising the art of seduction in \"pink satin slippers, edged with swansdown\", to Holly Golightly cruising Manhattan in a \"slim, cool black dress\" and pearl choker, the novel has rustled with great fashion moments ever since Jane Austen coined the word \"stylish\" in Sense And Sensibility. We can, as Cecil Beaton wrote, \"recreate the fashions of an age by studying its... art\" and successive generations of novelists have immortalised the suits, skirts and dresses they saw around them. Think of F Scott Fitzgerald's bobbed and powdered jazz age debutantes, Colin MacInnes' Italian-suited London mods, Bret Easton Ellis's Armani-wearing (psycho) bankers. </p> <p>One of fiction's first fashion-obsessed protagonists debuted in an 1869 novel by Mary Jane Holmes, Ethelyn's Mistake. (When I say \"fashion-obsessed\", I mean a woman who seriously believes bad dress sense is reasonable grounds for divorce.) The basic plot sees our heroine dumping her homely American husband in favour of a stylish ex-flame and the fashion capitals of Europe. She then wears some very fetching gowns. Unusually for the 19th century, an era better known for its selflessly submissive heroines, flighty Ethelyn has a happy ending. Unrepentant, she returns home still devoted to all things \u00e0 la mode, and even manages to convince her un-hip husband of the importance of looking stylish. The fashion-conscious literary heroine had most definitely arrived.</p> <p>Holmes was writing during the emergence of the modern fashion industry in Paris. Charles Frederick Worth had set up the first of the great French fashion houses and, by the 1870s, designers were making the leap from back-room dressmaker to celebrity. In certain circles, fashion was beginning to be treated seriously as an art form, and intellectual types such as Oscar Wilde and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 were writing for the new fashion magazines in London and Paris. In this atmosphere, the language of fashion began to find its way into novels and poetry. An early arriviste from the fashion industry was the word \"chic\" in the sense of \"'Stylish', in the best possible taste\" (Oxford English Dictionary). It first appeared in an English trade journal in 1879, and a year later Ouida was writing in Moths that, \"They are all chic you know.\" The term \"haute couture\" was sluggish by comparison. It didn't appear in an English-language publication until 1908, when it featured in Arnold Bennett's The Old Wives' Tale. As a result of this early fashion franglais, Anglo-Saxons remain convinced that their Gallic cousins epitomise all things stylish. (This is unfair: the beleaguered French already have reputations to uphold in the areas of cooking, romancing and the building of high-speed trains. To ask them to do all this while looking effortlessly chic is just cruel.) </p> <p>While gay Parisians were busy creating the fashion houses that would one day launch the careers of countless traders in knock-off perfume, the taciturn American working man was pulling on a pair of dirt-spattered Levi's. Like fashion-speak, the evolution of an item of clothing can be traced in literature. Take those Levi's. One of the first pairs of literary jeans appeared in an 1873 novel by Mark Twain, described as \"homespun\" garments. During the interwar period, jeans were associated with the working classes (worn by \"a fiend in butler's shape\" in PG Wodehouse's 1936 Laughing Gas), but fast-forward to 1968 and find Janet in John Updike's Couples \"wonderfully dressed: in a poppy-orange silk blouse and blue jeans shrunk and splotch-bleached like a teenager's and white calf-length boots\". Jeans have become fashionable evening attire; Calvin Klein and vast sums of cash are just around the corner. </p> <p>Or take another item dubbed a \"wardrobe staple\" by fashion magazines, the humble T-shirt. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, F Scott Fitzgerald bagged the first recorded reference in his 1920 debut, This Side Of Paradise. (Fittingly for a man who would go on to spend a lot of his time drunk, that book also contains the first record of the word \"daiquiri\".) Fitzgerald's T-shirt was an undergarment; by the time John Braine came to write Room At The Top, his 1957 paean to the provincial \"angry young man\", the T-shirt was out and proud. Just check out the rocking \"blue suede shoes, blue linen slacks... orange T-shirt, and white sunglasses\" combo. </p> <p>Conversely, some garments are notable for their lack of evolution. In Darwinian terms, such clothes are the crocodiles of the catwalk. Take the little black dress: created by Chanel in 1926 and appearing shortly afterwards in a novel by Francis Brett Young, the expensively plain LBD quickly became an enduring presence in the novel - from the Dorothy Parker character whose lover fails to notice her new \"so expensive that she would not think of the price\" black dress (the cad!) to Bridget Jones desperately scraping mashed potato off the shoes she plans to wear with her new, Darcy-attracting \"fantastic black dress\". Since 1926, the LBD has been a safe choice for any novelist wishing to emphasise a character's cosmopolitan good taste (Bridget's dress is borrowed, remember). What red-blooded woman doesn't dream of waking up in possession of Holly Golightly's signature gown? </p> <p>And if every fashion era has its own chronicler, who gets the job of immortalising contemporary wardrobes? William Boyd, Linda Grant and Will Self have all had interesting things to say, but as far as street fashion goes, my money's on Douglas Coupland. Despite the fact that it's now all about Generation Y, Coupland's definition of contemporary styling in Generation X still holds. It's a look he calls Decade Blending: \"In clothing: the indiscriminate combination of two or more items from various decades to create a personal mood: Sheila = Mary Quant earrings (60s) + cork wedgie platform shoes (70s) + black leather jacket (50s and 80s).\" Ethelyn would surely approve.</p>",
  "<p>Capitol Hill is a five-minute drive down Pennsylvania Avenue from the US Treasury and it was here as dusk fell in Washington on Thursday that the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, arrived for talks with leading members of Congress. Shown into the suite of offices of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, it was here on a sticky September day that the deal to save the American financial system from calamitous meltdown was done. </p> <p>In the room with Paulson were the most powerful central bankers in the world, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve; Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the key movers and shakers on Capitol Hill - Charles Schumer and Barney Frank.</p> <p>Schumer let the cat out of the bag to reporters ahead of the meeting. It had been called, he said, to discuss a plan whereby the US government would buy up the bad debts of America's banks -hundreds of billions of pounds of them - and put them in a state-owned asset management company.</p> <p>The remark flashed on to dealing screens just before the closing bell on Wall Street's stock market trading floor and the impact was immediate. Amid wild cheering, the Dow Jones Industrial Average took off in a rally which saw it gain more than 400 points in the last few minutes of trading.</p> <p>The recovery moved across the Pacific to Asia overnight and then rippled round to Europe. By the close of business in London last night, the FTSE 100 Index was more than 400 points higher. When traders went home from Canary Wharf a week earlier, on Friday September 12, the FTSE stood at 5416.7. When they left last night, the FTSE stood at 5311.3. The modest fall of 100 points or so gave no indication of quite what a momentous week it had been. </p> <p>At the meeting in Pelosi's office, called at the request of Paulson and Bernanke, the mood was tense if business-like. After the most traumatic week on Wall Street since the Great Depression, Paulson said something had to be done to shore up confidence in the financial system. Only two of America's investment banks - Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - had survived the week and there were doubts about the future of both.</p> <p>Paulson and Bernanke said the selling threatened to get out of control. What had started as a problem in one segment of the American mortgage market was in danger of becoming a global contagion. In Russia, the Kremlin had shut down the stock market. In Britain, the government had helped orchestrate a rescue of Britain's mortgage lenders. Gold prices had shown their biggest ever one-day rise. The rush for safe havens had pushed the interest rate on US treasury bonds negative for a brief period, suggesting that investors were willing to pay the government for the privilege of assured security.</p> <p>Bernanke and Paulson knew it would be something of a hard sell. Wall Street is not popular in the US after the excesses of recent years. Ordinary Americans have seen their incomes stagnate as the masters of the universe have seen theirs soar. There was little appetite on Capitol Hill for burdening the budget with extra debt, especially if it meant raising taxes. But the treasury secretary and the Fed chairman insisted there was no alternative. </p> <p>The Bush administration had tried bailing out banks. It had tried letting them fail. It had tried mergers. None had worked. All that was left was to establish a Resolution Trust Fund, of the sort that had been used when the American savings and loans industry had imploded in the late 1980s. Thursday's meeting was told that this crisis was of a different magnitude. They needed to agree to set up an RTC and they needed to set it up quickly - before Congress broke up for the November elections. Forget party point-scoring, Paulson said, this is bigger than politics.</p> <p>Schumer and Pelosi agreed with the need for urgent action, but they told Paulson that the price would be reform, serious and deep-rooted reform of Wall Street. </p> <p>When Paulson went in front of the cameras yesterday he kept his side of the bargain. \"This crisis demonstrates in vivid terms that our financial regulatory structure is sub-optimal, duplicative and outdated.\" Once the crisis is over, Wall Street has been served notice that it will face the sort of clean-up not seen since FDR took big finance to task after 1933. In the presidential race, the sense that the Republicans have been the party of deregulation and the party of the well-off has changed the complexion of the race, putting the economy centre stage and boosting the fortunes of Barack Obama. </p> <p>The Democratic candidate for the White House was not the only one to try to seize the moment. Battered in the polls, railed against by uneasy backbenchers, dismayed at the impact of looming recession on his economic legacy as chancellor, Gordon Brown grabbed the political lifeline presented by the tumbling markets. He announced on Thursday lunchtime that he would clean up the City and the first leg of the reform programme was unveiled six hours later when the Financial Services Authority, the City's watchdog, slapped a temporary ban on short selling. The FSA, under its new chairman, Lord Turner, will be given the task of making London's light-touch regulatory regime a bit more hard edged. </p> <p>As the week ended, three separate conclusions were being drawn. The first was that the financial landscape had changed - probably for ever. After the high-profile cull, there would undoubtedly be fewer banks and the ones that survived would operate differently. The second was that the era of deregulation would be replaced by re-regulation. Schumer suggested that the US was starting to look like France, and it wasn't meant as a compliment. </p> <p>Finally, while the measures taken this week may mark the beginning of the end of the financial crisis that erupted in August 2007, the economic effects will be felt for months if not years. \"These are the most difficult circumstances since the Great Depression,\" said Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University. \"The landscape is changing.\" In the UK, hedge fund dealers and short-sellers found themselves pilloried by the tabloids. It was, in short, a week like no other. </p> <p>It is often said how ordinary a day seemed, even as extraordinary events were about to unfold and so it was on Monday in New York, a gloriously sunny morning that gave no clue of the storm about to be unleashed on Wall Street. </p> <p>Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank, had filed for bankruptcy in the early hours after frantic talks to find a buyer had failed over the weekend. The firm, which was 158 years old, had made losses of $3.9bn in the third quarter alone after writing down bad investments in mortgages and commercial real estate. </p> <p>Paulson spent the weekend trying to broker a takeover of Lehman, but intensive talks with Barclays and Bank of America fell apart because of the refusal of the US government to offer any kind of guarantee for the liabilities on the investment bank's books. Having rescued Bear Stearns in March, the message was that some banks were not too big to fail after all. </p> <p>The Fed had agreed to absorb $29bn of losses to avoid the bankruptcy of the Bear and the government had also stepped in with a $200bn bailout of the mortgage finance giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just a week before Lehman faced bankruptcy. But Paulson had decided that enough was enough: the political will to risk any more taxpayers' money had temporarily evaporated and Lehman was left to go to the wall, the biggest bankruptcy in American history. </p> <p>For chief executive Richard Fuld, who had been with the firm for his entire career and who bragged that he bled green - the Lehman corporate colour - it was a personal disaster. The date was emblazoned on a digital screen fixed to the front of Lehman's glass and steel tower, September 15; the day the world changed. \"Nobody in the office thought we would go bankrupt,\" said one London trader at the firm. </p> <p>The trading screens on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange were lacerated with red. Panic set in and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index of leading shares, plummeted 504 points, the biggest one-day fall since the first day of trading after the terrorist attacks seven years earlier. In the UK, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, knew that the collapse of Lehman and the hastily arranged shotgun wedding between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch meant trouble. The Treasury knew that the gale would blow across the Atlantic and batter a big British bank and they had an inkling that that bank would be HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland) - heavily exposed to the plunging UK housing market and unable to access finance through the ossified wholesale money markets. Darling was right; as the markets tanked on Monday, HBOS was one of the biggest casualties.</p> <p>The next stage of the drama began on Monday night, when Brown met Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB, at a party hosted by Citigroup. Both men had seen a 17% fall in the share price of HBOS that day. Both knew a crisis was brewing at Britain's biggest mortgage lender. Words were exchanged; Lloyds was, in effect, being given clearance by the government to buy HBOS and to bypass the competition authorities.</p> <p>An outline of the plan had been worked on for weeks by two of Brown's closest aides - Jeremy Heywood, the permanent secretary at No 10, and business minister Lady Vadera. On Tuesday morning, as HBOS shares plunged again, falling 40% at their worst point, Eric Daniels, Lloyds TSB's chief executive, phoned Downing Street.</p> <p>HBOS's submission was inevitable. Its pleas that its capital position was \"strong\" had been ignored by the market. Worse, savers were beginning to withdraw money. At least \u00a31bn had been taken out on Monday, a small fraction of HBOS's total deposit base, but alarming nonetheless.</p> <p>The task of Andy Hornby, chief executive, was to secure the best possible price for his shareholders. The bank had raised \u00a34bn from its shareholders in June at 275p, so a take-out price below that level would be a humiliation for HBOS. Hornby and his chairman, Lord Stevenson, set themselves the goal of 300p-a-share, a price Lloyds initially appeared to be prepared to pay. Markets, once again, intervened. On Wednesday morning, HBOS's shares fell heavily, hitting 80p at their lowest point. The horrible prospect of a run on the bank was now a real possibility. Officials at No 10 decided the secret negotiations had to be made public immediately. The BBC broke the story soon after 9am and named a price of 300p. Official confirmation, via the Stock Exchange, came only at 1.25pm.</p> <p>Key members of the two banks' board agreed to meet. Daniels and Blank argued that 300p was too high a price for Lloyds to pay. Soon after 9pm, the deal was signed. With little negotiating power, Hornby and Stevenson had agreed to sell HBOS for 232p-a-share, or \u00a312.2bn. </p> <p>But Downing Street had extracted a pound of flesh. Lloyds could avoid a competition inquiry but it had to give the government something in return. The formal announcement on Thursday morning made the deal clear. Lloyds' new mortgage lending would \"continue at least at current levels and will expand as market conditions improve\". In addition, the \"management focus is to keep jobs in Scotland,\" said the announcement. Savage cost cuts from a government-brokered takeover in his own backyard as the Labour party conference began would have been difficult to contemplate. </p> <p>While the race was on to save Britain's biggest mortgage lender, AIG, the world's largest insurance group and sponsor of Manchester United, was scrambling for financial help. Its shares fell 61% in a single day as the Fed worked to raise a $75bn loan from the private sector. AIG had in recent years expanded rapidly into insurance contracts to investors who bought the complex mortgage debt securities. It was determined that a collapse of the firm would be catastrophic, setting off a deadly chain reaction because it was so deeply rooted in the financial system. </p> <p>AIG failed to find a white knight and time was running out. At 6.30pm on Tuesday, Paulson and Bernanke met with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver the bad news. After initially refusing to put more taxpayer money on the line, the Fed had reversed course, taken control of the firm and injected $85bn. </p> <p>Hyan Song Shin, professor of economics at Princeton, said the level of government intervention had reached astonishing levels. \"We have run out of superlatives. But it does show quite an adaptability and a pragmatism, which is actually quite refreshing.\" </p> <p>Uwe Reinhardt, also at Princeton, was less kind. \"This fiasco may conceivably trigger a major shift in American, and possibly British, popular beliefs. Gone will be the mindless belief in the mantra that the private sector will always do what's best for America and is self-regulating. How could one still defend that proposition?\" </p> <p>Wall Street appeared calmer but the banks were paralysed with fear. The cost of overnight lending, the short-term loans that oil the financial markets, rose to unprecedented levels as banks became even more wary of each other, despite the central banks pumping billions more into the system. </p> <p>By Wednesday the Dow was plummeting again, 449 points. \"It is just total chaos and uncertainty,\" said one trader, the next day. \"With the AIG bailout, you would think the market should be up.\" The pace of events still didn't slow. The savings bank Washington Mutual put itself up for sale. It also emerged that Morgan Stanley was in talks to merge with the commercial bank Wachovia and other potential partners, as its shares fell to 10-year lows, leaving Goldman Sachs as the sole remaining independent investment bank. </p> <p>By the end of the week, analysts were trying to work out what will happen next. Some changes looked glaringly obvious. The practice of short-selling, betting that a share price will drop, the \"spivs\" and \"speculators\", in the words of Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond, was temporarily banned on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>There were also fears for the wider impact on the twin capitals of finance. About 5% of the jobs in New York are in financial services but they account for about a quarter of wages. Even before the events of the weekend NY had lost 11,000 banking jobs and London some 20,000. In London, there has been a boom in building new office space, some 80% of which is speculative and now could be left empty. </p> <p>\"In my view, the kindest thing one could say about American bankers, and their copycats at UBS etc, is that they were reckless,\" says Reinhardt. \"Our financial sector has arguably visited more harm on our economy than bin Laden could ever have dreamt of inflicting.\"</p> <h2>Just who is to blame for this mess?</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Alan Greenspan </strong>The alleged grandfather of the credit binge that gave rise to the current crisis. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Ben Bernanke</strong> Raised interest rates so fast and so far that it triggered millions of home repossessions. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>The Bush government </strong>Allowed huge mortgage boom with little regulation. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Short-sellers </strong>Hedge funds that bet against the survival of banks.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Henry Paulson</strong> US treasury secretary may have wielded big bucks in recent weeks, but he bet last year that Wall Street could sort out its own mess.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Bob Diamond</strong> Head of Barclays investment banking business.

He put all the details in a diary, alongside the deaths of 300 rabbits and 40 ravens.</p> <p>Burden was yesterday given a six-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service, after pleading guilty to killing two buzzards, attempting to kill two other birds, and killing two badgers.</p> <p>He also admitted setting illegal traps, possessing a shotgun while committing two of the offences, and asked for five other offences of killing badgers to be taken into consideration.</p> <p>The notes he kept, complete with symbols for the deaths of different animals, suggested he may have killed many more birds of prey, Telford magistrates heard.</p> <p>The court heard how Burden, of Kempton, Lydbury North in Shropshire, worked on the 6,000-acre Kempton estate near Bishop's Castle, south Shropshire.</p> <p>He used a shotgun to kill and attempt to kill common buzzards in May and July last year, said Phil Mason, prosecuting. Burden initially denied any wrongdoing when Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began an investigation into allegations of illegal practices at Kempton.</p> <p>Mason said: \"This is an unusual case, in that it came to light as a result of information received from two other gamekeepers. One of the witnesses saw Burden shoot a number of buzzards and also club to death a number of badgers that had been caught in snares.\"</p> <p>Urging magistrates to impose a community sentence, Burden's lawyer, Huw Williams, said his client was of exemplary character and had not committed the offences for pleasure or gratuitously: \"This man was born and bred in the countryside - he knows full well that what he has done is wrong. </p> <p>\"He did it to help other birds - that's the paradox of this case.</p> <p>\"In this world of shooting, which is a huge industry, the likes of Kyle Burden are used to prepare the shoots.</p> <p>\"There has to be a set number of birds for those with money to come to these estates and enjoy the kill.\"</p> <p>Burden, who received a letter of dismissal from Kempton yesterday, had seen his stock of birds drop from 18,000 to 12,000 prior to the offences, the court heard. \"He thought he was doing right by his flock of birds,\" Williams added.</p> <p>Sentencing Burden, magistrate Claire Brentnall said the bench had taken into account the defendant's obvious remorse and his youth.</p> <p>The magistrate told Burden: \"We appreciate that you are very clearly remorseful and we have also taken into account your positive good character.\"</p> <p>Outside court Mark Thomas, spokesperson for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \"It sends a very strong signal out, to get the six months maximum sentence.</p> <p>\"That is a great result for the RSPB and the police, it sends out a very clear message that you cannot kill birds of prey in the countryside and get away with it.\"</p> <p>But Kit Davidson, a spokesman for Animal Aid, said: \"It's a great shame to see a 19-year-old lad in court taking the rap for this.</p> <p>\"There is an attitudinal problem in the game keeping industry - these gamekeepers are being driven by their duty to their employers.</p> <p>\"Why is the law not altered, so that employers are responsible for the actions of their employees?\"</p>",
  "<p>Point of view is one of the most important basics for any piece of fiction; not having a firm hold on point of view can cause no end of problems. There are two types of point of view that tend to dominate most current writing: first person, or stories that are narrated by the \"I\", like Lionel Shriver's narrator in We Need To Talk About Kevin', and third person, where the point of view, using \"he\" or \"she\", is limited to one or more characters, a technique used, for example, by Jonathan Frantzen in The Corrections. Less common are the second person, or \"you\" and \"we\" - used to good effect in Joshua Ferris's recent first novel, Then We Came to the End - and the third person omniscient, where the writing moves in and out of various character's points of view fluidly, of which Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway is a tour de force. Many novels use multiple points of view, for example, alternating between first and third. </p> <p>A useful exercise is to look at a selection of your favourite novels and see what point of view the writer has used. First person can lend a story intimacy; when combined with the present tense this can contribute hugely to narrative pace, while multiple third person can give a story a rich, polyphonic density. When you begin to write a piece of fiction, choose which point of view, or points of view, you are going to use, and then stick to it. It's important that you control point of view; don't let it control you. </p> <h2>Stephen King on situation versus plot</h2> <p>In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts: narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and dialogue, which brings characters to life.</p> <p>You may wonder where plot is in all this. The answer - my answer, anyway - is nowhere. I won't try to convince you that I've never plotted any more than I'd try to convince you that I've never told a lie, but I do both as infrequently as possible. I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible. </p> <p>Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and laboured. I lean more heavily on intuition, and have been able to do that because my books tend to be based on situation rather than story. Some of the ideas which have produced those books are more complex than others, but the majority start out with the stark simplicity of a department store window display or a waxwork tableau. I want to put a group of characters (perhaps a pair; perhaps even just one) in some sort of predicament and then watch them try to work themselves free.</p> <p>The situation comes first. The characters - always flat and unfeatured, to begin with - come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded of a set of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I want them to do things their way. In some instances, the outcome is what I visualised. In most, however, it's something I never expected. For a suspense novelist, this is a great thing. I am, after all, not just the novel's creator but its first reader. And if I'm not able to guess with any accuracy how the damned thing is going to turn out, I can be pretty sure of keeping the reader in a state of page-turning anxiety. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an extract from On Writing by Stephen King</p>",
  "<p>Every Coke has a Pepsi, every Visa a MasterCard. Who do you support in the Boat Race and why? Don't you dare tell me you couldn't give a fig either way: it's Oxford or Cambridge, at some point one must develop a preference, for whatever reason. It's Harvard or Yale, Harpic or Domestos, AA or RAC, PC or Mac. Binary tribalism: Gilbert and Sullivan wrote a song about it.</p> <p>In the world of serious SLR photography, the choice has always been between Nikon or Canon. The single lens reflex (SLR) camera is best defined as being the sort of camera where what you see is what you shoot. As the initials tell you, it is a single lensed entity, a lens that can be changed with a twist of its bayonet. A clever mirror ensures the viewfinder's image is more or less congruent to that of the lens. The SLR is the choice of photojournalists, paparazzi, sports photographers - anyone who needs fast, accurate shooting. The camera goes up to the eye and will be manufactured (with apologies to Pentax, Olympus, Leica and Minolta) by Nikon or Canon. A huge range of Nikkor F-mount lenses for the Nikon and EOS EF lenses for the Canon have built up over the years; they are forwardly and backwardly compatible with new DSLR and old SLR bodies, but not across the brands. An EOS won't fit a Nikon body nor a Nikkor a Canon. There are issues with older Canons and with some Nikon auto focus lenses, but generally speaking, this broad description is correct. A profitable war zone where two major powers continue to joust.</p> <p>One of the most active battlefields within this world is that of the entry level DSLR. Many people with ordinary compact digitals decide, after a while, that they are ready for the Real Thing. Serious professional kit is wildly expensive, but there is the mid-priced range for the prosumer (yes, isn't that a lovely word?), and finally there is the \"My First SLR\" category, hotly contested because once a toe is dipped into either the Nikkor or EOS pool, it is unlikely the customer will change: too much will have been invested in the lenses.</p> <p>Canon has had its reliable 400D and 450D and Nikon their excellent D40 and D60 models available as entry level DSLRs for some time, but I have been spending the past week in the company of Canon's new 1000D (aka the Rebel XS or Kiss F), which I will come straight out and say I adore. It does everything you could hope to welcome a newcomer to the field of SLR photography.</p> <p>New DSLRs are exceptionally annoying: the outlay is far from insignificant and it is galling when, six months after you've taken the plunge, a new one comes along. I won't claim that Canon will never improve on the 1000D, but I can recommend the plunge being taken here and now. For about \u00a3400 you get one hell of a lovely camera. It is astoundingly light (some people will dislike that; I happen to love it), manageable and friendly. With four-stop image stabilisation, a 10.2 MP sensor, a customisable menu, an integrated anti-dust self-cleaning system, a large enough LCD display (albeit slightly smaller than other models), excellent Pro software, the Digic III processor used in higher-end models, SD and SDHC (but not Compact Flash) memory card compatibility and just about all the features you would expect on a prosumer model (no spot metering though, which some users will miss), it is superb value for money. It reacts quickly in Jpeg mode and, most importantly, takes fantastically high quality, low noise photographs using a gigantic permutation of manual and automatic settings. A true pro would wish for faster responses when shooting RAW, but for the rest of us, this is The One. All the convenience and ease of a compact is there, but underneath lies the potential of a real grown-up SLR. If you do buy one, give yourself time slowly to learn about real photography. Be warned: as in music and painting, no gadget can replace talent. For what it's worth, I have Mr Magoo's eye for a shot.</p> <h2>Initials of the week</h2> <p><strong>DSLR</strong> Digital single lens reflex.</p> <p><strong>SDHC</strong> Secure digital high capacity memory cards. </p> <p><strong>RAW </strong>An uncompressed, unprocessed image file.

  "<p><strong>Bounder! The Biography of Terry-Thomas </strong><br>by Graham McCann<br>308pp, Aurum, \u00a316.99</p> <p><strong>50 Years of Carry On </strong><br>by Richard Webber<br>358pp, Century, \u00a318.99</p> <p>Was he bounder or cad, arriviste or parvenu? Terry-Thomas, a suburban show-off with champagne tastes, was certainly a sybaritic old rascal, but it was all a magnificent act that sheered off into a tragic decline. Ten years after his Hollywood apogee, and a life of luxury on Ibiza, he was shivering with Parkinson's disease, broke and almost forgotten, though comforted by his second wife and their two sons, in an unfurnished flat in Barnes. The arc of his life is like that of a Marlovian tragic hero. And it's so predictable. </p> <p>The best of British comedy, like pantomime or mugs of tea, is not really suitable for export. Dudley Moore went to Hollywood, but who'd swap even the least bad of his films there for a single Pete'n'Dud sketch? In good comedy, the parochialism is all. But Terry-Thomas - the first guest on Michael Parkinson's TV chat show in 1970 - was conceived as an export to start with. In Hollywood in the 60s he flourished as a parody of a Wodehouse character in films such as Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Richard Quine's How to Murder Your Wife, in which he played a beautifully exaggerated Jeevesian butler to Jack Lemmon's confirmed bachelor. </p> <p>With his braying laugh, sly little moustache, gap-toothed manic grin and brash dandyism, Terry-Thomas was more of an institution than an actor, though as Graham McCann's highly readable biography points out, the image was marinated in many years of music hall, radio and the first days of TV. T-T was massive: a radio headliner in the 30s, a star variety turn in Ensa during the war, and the host of the first comedy series on television in 1949, How Do You View (\"How do you view? Are you frightfully well? You are? Oh, good show!\").</p> <p>Christened in 1911 as Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens (the single, hyphenated moniker was adopted in 1948), the son of a bowler-hatted butcher in North Finchley, he reinvented himself after an unhappy childhood (both parents drank, and didn't get on). Even as an unknown, he'd swagger round the West End in spats and waistcoats, cigarette holder at the ready. He had, as they used to say, an eye for the ladies, and he enjoyed a drink. In Hollywood, he fixed little metal Union flags to his Bentley, and he always took a fold-away ping-pong table with him on to film sets. </p> <p>He sounds like great company. Even Kingsley Amis remembers him almost fondly in his memoirs. Lucky Jim opened the Edinburgh film festival of 1957, and Amis warmed to T-T as he led the publicity party on a merry dance through various low dives on Princes Street; Amis thought he was not much of an actor, and was totally miscast as Bertrand, \"the posturing painter and leading shit of the novel ... [but] the hash he made of the part was so comic that the result was a net gain\". </p> <p>McCann suggests that the cackling glove-puppet Basil Brush is a sort of tribute to T-T. Other more recent evocations are noted in the flash posturing of boxer Chris Eubank and Paul Whitehouse's crumbling alcoholic bore, the 13th Duke of Wybourne, on The Fast Show. But neither parody, if that's what they are, comes close to suggesting the energy and style you can still sample in T-T's performance as the bounder Sir Percival Ware-Armitage in Ken Annakin's Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. I love the remark of a producer, quoted by McCann, that the great Arthur Askey had a sense of comedy, but no sense of humour. There was always something humorous and fallible about T-T, and it shows in his performances. He played deeply against type as a habitual offender, Alfred Green, in the Boulting brothers' still very funny Brothers in Law (1956). Although he was only on screen for a few minutes, he slept in Alf's clothes for two weeks before filming and rubbed the seams of his suit with pumice stone to accentuate the scruffiness. His debonair surface hid a dedication to his craft. </p> <p>McCann, who has written splendid volumes about Morecambe and Wise and Frankie Howerd, tells his story well, and reveals that T-T turned down the television comedy series Two's Company with Elaine Stritch because the money was risible, and dropped out of Derek Jarman's The Tempest. T-T died in 1990. His Ibiza villa is now a holiday hotel run by his second son. </p> <p>Terry-Thomas was peaking just as the Carry On films were launched at Pinewood Studios in 1958 with Carry On Sergeant. The whole series of 31 movies were cheap as chips (except when they hired Phil Silvers, unwisely, for the Beau Geste spoof Carry On Follow That Camel in 1967) and each was shot in six weeks. It's Richard Webber's contention, in this chatty and largely non-analytical survey, that the first six films, penned by Norman Hudis, were superior to the rest, largely written by Talbot Rothwell (a writer for the Crazy Gang and on Terry-Thomas's early TV programmes, who died in 1981).</p> <p>Hudis had charm, but Rothwell bumped up the innuendoes, which - apart from the comic talents of Sid James, Hattie Jacques, Joan Sims, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor - are the series' greatest claim to fame. Rothwell's scripts for Carry On Up the Khyber and Carry On Camping are unparalleled as repositories of blue rudery in the finest music hall tradition. </p> <p>In Carry On Cleo (1964), Rothwell and the ever-present team of producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas came up with the best of all their spoofs in the wake of the ponderous Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor epic Cleopatra, even managing to hijack some of the costumes. And when Williams as the doomed Caesar rushes to the camera and cries: \"Infamy, infamy; they've all got it in for me!\" we have proof that all British comedy is interconnected; Rothwell always acknowledged (though Webber doesn't) that the line was a graciously permitted steal from that peerless writing duo of Frank Muir and Denis Norden. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Michael Coveney's books include The World According to Mike Leigh (HarperCollins)</p>",
  "<p>Humberto Sol\u00e1s , who has died from cancer aged 66, was the enfant terrible of Cuban cinema in the 1960s - a time when Cuba was the enfant terrible of world cinema - achieving international success in 1968 with his first feature film, Luc\u00eda, at the age of 27.</p> <p>Born in Havana, he was 14 when he joined the urban underground movement struggling against the dictator Fulgencio Batista in support of Fidel Castro's rural guerrillas. In 1960, the year after the revolution, having graduated in history from the University of Havana, he joined a new film institute, the ICAIC, and made his first short.</p> <p>The last of his apprentice works, the 40-minute Manuela (1966), was intended as part of a three-episode film but was released on its own. It was a romanticised but neorealist tale of a campesina, a young peasant woman who demonstrates that the qualities needed to be a rebel soldier are not exclusively male. She is the first of a stream of leading female protagonists that feature in several of Sol\u00e1s's most impressive films, beginning two years later with Luc\u00eda.</p> <p>Luc\u00eda was a tour de force: three episodes in three different cinematic styles about three women, each called Luc\u00eda, set during three different moments in Cuba's history. Luc\u00eda 1895 is shot in a histrionic style, influenced by the Italian director Luchino Visconti, replete with the extraordinary image of naked black liberation fighters riding out to meet the Spanish cavalry. Luc\u00eda 1933 turns to Hollywood models and adopts the more sedate style of domestic melodrama by Cukor or Kazan, while Luc\u00eda 196? takes on the hue of the nouvelle vague</p> <p>His next feature, Un dia de noviembre (A November day) was made in 1972 during what the Cuban writer Ambrosio Fornet has dubbed \"the five grey years\", when sectarians held the reins of cultural power. However, the ICAIC declined to release it for several years, and it was not a success. </p> <p>Sol\u00e1s then returned to a historic theme for Cantata de Chile in 1976. This was a musico-dramatic tapestry, composed by Leo Brouwer, which paid homage to victims of the Chilean coup of 1973 by re-enacting the dockers' strike and subsequent massacre at the port of Iquique in northern Chile in 1907.</p> <p>In between these feature films, Sol\u00e1s continued to make more modest documentaries, including the exquisite dance film, Simparel\u00e9 (1974), and a study of the great Cuban surrealist painter Wifredo Lam (1979) - films in which he affirms his identity as a very Cuban artist. </p> <p>However, trouble befell the epic Cecilia in 1981, a film fated to provoke a crisis in the ICAIC. Taken from the most popular of 19th-century Cuban novels, which celebrated the figure of the mulata (a woman of mixed race), Sol\u00e1s gave it a sumptuous but free and dark adaptation which disconcerted both traditionalists and the popular audience, and the film was massacred by the critics.</p> <p>It was the most expensive production the ICAIC had ever undertaken, but in part the film suffered from the co-production arrangements needed to finance it, which called for three different versions: a six-hour serialisation for Spanish television, a four-hour version for Cuban cinema release, and a shorter version for international release. It is difficult for a film to retain its identity in such circumstances. Worse still, it overran its shooting schedule by many months, throwing everybody else's production plans into disarray, causing considerable chagrin among other film-makers. The attack on the film proved fatal, not for Sol\u00e1s, but for the ICAIC's founder and president, Alfredo Guevara. When Cecilia flopped, despite European co-production funding and its quality feel, disarray at the film institute enabled Guevara's old enemies to edge him out of power.</p> <p>The institute's new president, the film-maker Julio Garc\u00eda Espinosa, immediately put Sol\u00e1s to work on his next film. This was Amada (1983), a low-budget love story with political undertones set at the time of the first world war, written and co-directed by the doyen of Cuban film editors, Nelson Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>With Un hombre de \u00c9xito (A Successful Man, 1986), he told a tale of opportunism and corruption in pre-revolutionary Cuba, made on a very modest budget for which his habitual cinematographer, Livio Delgado, nevertheless contrived an opulent mise-en-sc\u00e8ne</p> <p>But then in 1991 came another super-production, made for French television, an adaptation of Alejo Carpentier's great historical novel, El siglo de las luces (Explosion in a Cathedral). A film no less ambitious than Cecilia, it was likewise an international co-production made for television, and suffered some of the same consequences, although it worked brilliantly as a television drama series. Sol\u00e1s called this tale of the French revolution his \"political testament\". Behind the historical imagery is a critique of revolutionary power which can be read as an allegory on the present day, though none of this was mentioned by the critics. It was not an international success but was much admired in Cuba. This is not to say that Sol\u00e1s had changed his political stripes. A man of fierce intelligence - and a wonderful conversationalist - he remained staunchly loyal to both the film institute and to his country.</p> <p>However, as Cuba was overwhelmed by economic crisis following the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, in cinematic terms Sol\u00e1s completely changed tack, moving into digital film-making. With the ICAIC thrown into a funding crisis, he shot Miel para Osh\u00fan (Honey for Osh\u00fan, 2001) and other late films on DVD. He supported \"no-budget\" cinema, or rather, cine pobre (cinema of poverty), reviving a term used across Latin America in the 1960s to describe the radical cinema of the day. </p> <p>In 2003 he set up an international festival of cine pobre at Gibara on Cuba's north-east coast, where in 1967 he had found colonial streets for a scene in Luc\u00eda, and where he returned to film some scenes for Miel para Osh\u00fan. In five short years, the event has become a magnet for a widespread movement spawned by digital video. It has also expanded into a lively and diverse arts festival.</p> <p>Sol\u00e1s is survived by his sister.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Humberto Sol\u00e1s, film-maker, born December 4 1941; died September 17 2008</p>",
  "<p>HSBC blamed market turmoil yesterday as it walked away from a $6.3bn (\u00a33.4bn) deal to buy a controlling stake in one of Korea's biggest banks but it raised speculation that it was preparing to pounce on rival banks struggling under the global credit crunch. </p> <p>It abandoned its offer for a 51% stake in Korea Exchange Bank, the country's sixth-biggest commercial bank, after nine months of negotiation with the US private equity firm Lone Star in a deal that has been beset with regulatory delays. </p> <p>Sandy Flockhart, HSBC Asia chief executive, said: \"In the light of developments around the world, not least changes in asset values, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of shareholders to continue to pursue this acquisition.\" </p> <p>HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, has fared better than most rivals during the financial crisis, supported by its global spread and diversified deposit base.

  "<p>It was the plastic teapot sweetly proffered by my two-year-old daughter, Mery, that finally made me decide to take a break from the booze. \"Glass of wine, Mummy?\" she asked, head cocked to one side, all big blue innocent eyes. At the time I was slumped on the sofa, reading three-day-old Sunday papers and trying hard to suppress the rising self-loathing erupting from the pit of my queasy stomach. Once again I had quaffed much too much wine: about six very large glasses of house white, with the girls - or rather thirtysomething fellow mums - during a five hour session at the village local, an evening that culminated in me being thrown out for telling the French chef that he couldn't cook. </p> <p>I don't remember much after that. I've no idea how, or at what time, I staggered home, although my husband smugly reports he heard a \"terrible crashing about at 1am\".</p> <p>I have long suspected that I am becoming a cliche: Cotswold resident, thirtysomething, ex-career lady now slack housewife, mother of three, commuter husband, seeks solace avec chardonnay bottle. Rather horrifyingly, my profile echoes the secret wino as portrayed in the government's latest anti-binge drinking TV adverts: the rioja-guzzling mummy who doesn't notice the units clocking up, believing her habit is normal and innocent.</p> <p>There were other telltale signs of a casual habit spiralling out of control. My diary started to take shape around predicted hangovers - I knew if I was going out somewhere that the following morning would be a write-off. I'd also started to have two bottles of wine open at the same time so my husband would be confused by my alcohol consumption. Even I must acknowledge that such subterfuge hints at addiction. Or at least that I was a binge boozer. According to the International Centre for Alcohol Policies,...#65279; binge drinking is the practice of consuming more than four drinks in one sitting. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I can spend a booze-free night. What I can't do is have just one drink. The first is so very nice I'll always want another. And now those two have made me feel all warm and politely woozy, it would be a shame to bypass a lovely third or, indeed, a fourth. Half a bottle or 4.5 units later, a binge drinker is born. This happens, if I'm honest, about five nights a week. Although if I'm in a more social setting, I will go for an all-out \"bonkers binge\".</p> <p>Finally the shame, self-doubt, doomed liver, despairing husband, empty purse and guilt over the corruption of my own children's playtime rituals led me to surrender to a period of abstinence from alcohol. I had to climb on that wagon. This is how it went.</p> <p><strong>Week one</strong></p> <p>I approach day one of Giving Up Booze with trepidation. Do I really have a problem? Maybe cutting down is an option ... Am I just normal and paranoid? Should I get my liver weighed or scanned or whatever it is one does for motivation? How fat is my liver - as overweight as I am (I have a surplus stone)? Will giving up change my essential me-ness? Oh my God, I might become boring! Etcetera. </p> <p>Actually, Monday's fine. I often don't drink on a Monday so I manage that. Tuesday is like another Monday, so that's cool. Smugness sees me through Wednesday. Thursday finds me on some mad high of abstemiousness; this is the longest I've been without alcohol since my last pregnancy (two years): now that's a sobering thought. Friday is a bit of a black spot because I feel that frisson of excitement one gets at the start of the weekend but without the traditional toast of an extra large \"mummy's juice\". I battle on with a chilled glass of mineral water, fantasising about how fit and slim I will be by morning.</p> <p>I wake up no more obviously goddess-like than when I went to bed, but I do feel supersonically invigorated after my regular three-mile Saturday morning jog. Usually I procrastinate and it often feels like a slog, depending on what I've drunk the night before.</p> <p>We take the kids to the Horrible Histories theatre at lunchtime, which is a welcome distraction, except for the interval when I have a bit of a teary moment recollecting the V&amp;T I would usually be enjoying, with its playful tinkle of ice on glass and maybe even a slice and swizzle stick. So demented is my ensuing frustration that I go ballistic booing an Awful Egyptian in the second half. My seven-year-old, Molly, not known for rectitude, gives me a worried and slightly embarrassed look. </p> <p>By Sunday I notice that Steve, my husband, also hasn't had a drink this week. Yes, he confirms, he is also knocking booze on the head \"for a while\". Typically, he does things quietly, while I threaten loudly, advertising to the world my intention to write a novel/diet/do impressive stuff, obviously setting myself up for failure. But not this time. </p> <p><strong>Week two</strong></p> <p>I feel incredibly virtuous, but am suffering terrible tension-derived jaw ache, my teeth stubbornly refusing to unclench without the reward of a Cinzano moment. And my dreams have become strange fitful affairs: last night I had a vivid dream in which I was sipping a glass of chilled chardonnay. Even in my sleep I could sense the icy sugariness hitting my brain and untapping my blocked-up hypothalamus, the bit of the brain that houses the endorphins, poor little fellas trapped in there like that. I'm cringeing as I confess this, but I had to get up and remove the two bottles of wine left over from Christmas chilling in the fridge and shove them in the utility room by the tumble dryer so they'd warm up and stop haunting me. I can't abide warm white wine. </p> <p>Experiencing bouts of manic fidgetiness, I decide to redirect my energies into bringing order and cleanliness into the dysfunctional explosion of clutter we call home. I also take up drinking coffee. It has a kick, so is perfect for us semi-addicted types who find functioning under our own steam a bit of a chore, but if I'm at all hungover the thought of coffee makes me nauseous in the extreme. Anyway, as I'm not drinking, coffee has become my new thing. Although obviously not just coffee: mine's a latte with an extra shot please, barista. Caffeine and tidying, it's my Stepford Wife phase and I'm rocking it. The children skip around the house, marvelling at its tidiness. Syd, my boy, aged four, has a friend round and proudly points out the fine detailing on his hitherto obscured-by-toys Argos carpet. It has a lovely cityscape on it.</p> <p><strong>Week three</strong></p> <p>A feeling of decrepitude has snuck over me this week. For starters, I look absolutely ruddy awful. I'm sleeping loads, in a near coma, a deep, deep dribbly sleep. When I wake I'm as puffy as Mrs Puff (of SpongeBob SquarePants fame), with huge grey saddlebags resting under my bulbous eyes. First thing Tuesday morning I catch myself in the mirror and I look especially bad, as if I've aged a decade overnight, and I have sprouted three huge, evil, yellow-headed spots, which have made themselves comfy among the chin bristles. Clearly the booze had been having some kind of pickling effect on my system and I'm going into a Dorian Gray-style meltdown. Maybe it's the toxins escaping, but do they have to leave via my face?</p> <p>As if the whole ugly thing wasn't bad enough, I have spectacularly failed to lose much weight - a ton of deprivation and a few measly pounds lost. Which, of course, was good news in one way: it meant that, contrary to my fears, it wasn't wine that was making me cuddly, although the carb-craving hangovers can't have helped.</p> <p>Anyway the whole ugly/fat thing got to me. Normally I'd have a drink and forget about it, but since that's not an option I sink into a bit of a funk instead. Defiantly I make Nigella's pork in cider for tea, which, of course, involves buying a 50p can of Strongbow from the bargain bin of the supermarket. I knew as I bought it that an hour later I would glug some from the can. And indeed I do. It tastes absolutely rank and all I feel is deep shame that I am reduced to furtively guzzling warm cider in the kitchen while I'm supposed to be making supper. Steve asks what we're up to at the weekend. \"Not drinking,\" I reply sullenly. He looks surprised. Obviously life's the same happy event for him, with or without booze. Usually I look forward to the weekend: the Friday night drink, the gastropub visits, the celebratory the-kids-are-asleep pop of the Saturday night bottle ... all gone. I feel a bit lost.</p> <p>We take the kids to Country World for the day on Saturday. It's pelting with rain, but we race around playing crazy golf, panning for gold, feeding goats and marvelling at the residents of Guinea Pig Village (\"the largest in Europe\"). The great thing about kids is that even the naffest places become a hoot, and our brilliant family day gives me a boot up my self-pitying jacksie and puts a bit of perspective on the whole business of giving up. My beloved children are all the motivation I need. </p> <p>However, that doesn't mean I'm not gagging for a drink after our day trip. Stopping at Pizza Express on the way back I have a wobbly moment when the waiter offers us the wine list. I make do with a cappuccino, which I bolt down, and immediately order another. Even the waiter gives me a worried look when I order a third.</p> <p><strong>Week four</strong></p> <p>There is nothing quite as effective as the tedium of domestic servitude for driving a poor woman to drink. Housework is largely pointless: it's like the mythical, endlessly replenishing wine glass; as you drain the mess from one room, somewhere down the hall another bubbles over with discarded clothes, mouldy crockery, waste paper, sticks and general kids' squalor. There's no point in tidying, it'll only get messy again. I was fooling myself and can never hope to keep on top of the demented mess that is our home. I feel so much better now that I've succumbed to its squalor. My husband says he misses my manic efficiency.</p> <p>Then two days short of a month of abstinence, I go to an innocent-sounding PTA meeting. But there is wine. </p> <p>I get totally blotto, end up in the village pub, and can't remember getting home. The next day I feel shaky. I get in the car to drive the toddler to nursery and am sick into my own lap and on to the steering wheel. I sit there, not quite sure what to do with my lap-puddle of puke. I realise I can't drive and that I am a wretched individual. My sunny toddler sits strapped in her seat waiting for the car to start. I have reached a nadir. </p> <p>Alcoholics can never drink again once they have stopped because they can't be trusted. A friend of mine hasn't had a drink in 15 years, but he had got so bad that he had to spend two weeks in hospital after snorting dry cleaning fluid. At least my depravity hasn't sunk quite so low. I didn't want to quit drinking altogether, but I was beginning to wonder, for the sake of the kids, if I could ever be a mere casual tippler.</p> <p>I resolve to give myself another chance. These are my new rules: </p> <p>1) No drinking at home except on very special occasions, and never more than four glasses; 2) When out, remember not to drink so much that I behave too foolishly or can't remember what happened the next day.</p> <p><strong>Week five</strong></p> <p>Uh-oh. I am invited to the NME Awards, infamous for scenes of rock'n'roll excess. This is the test. I've attended many times - in a former, more carefree, life I was a journalist on the NME, and I've always got bladdered there. I've done things in toilets that have forced me to go into hiding for a whole week at a time. When I was invited this year I hesitated - could I be trusted? There would be copious amounts of free booze, celebs to accost, dancefloors to make a giant prawn of myself on. I realised that this was it. If I can't obey my own new rules, then it will be a life of sobriety for me, from here to eternity.</p> <p>On arrival I am presented with a Monkey Shoulder, whisky mixed with ginger beer and lime. It is delicious, and I happily slurp down a second. But that's it, until right at the end of the ceremony when, new drinking sophisticate that I am, I opt for a mandarin vodka and tonic. I feel warm and chirpy, sociable but not scarily over-friendly. </p> <p>Some time after dawn the next morning, I poke open a slightly bleary but perfectly functioning eye and spot a wilted daffodil strewn across the pillow. It takes a faltering second to remember where it came from: ah yes, Frank Carter from indie-punk outfit the Gallows presented it to me after his turn at the awards. I remember everything, I have no cringey recollections, just a fuzzy feeling of bonhomie. </p> <p>Also on the pillow rests my baby girl's darling head, abloom with tousled golden curls. I breathe in her sugary mustiness and don't feel sick at all. I am totally hangover-free. </p> <p>Job done ... for now.</p>",
  "<h2>Are we facing the jobless figures we saw in Thatcher's Britain?</h2> <p>Don't bet against it. Unemployment leapt in August, and an avalanche of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/redundancy\">redundancies</a> are now expected. The rise in claimants of 32,500 during August was the biggest since December 1992 and the seventh increase in a row. The widely recognised Labour Force Survey showed joblessness rising 81,000 to 1.72 million, or 5.5% of the workforce.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citigroup, says that as the economy continues to slide into recession, the dole queues will peak by late 2010 at 2.25 million.</p> <p>Others are more pessimistic. A fortnight ago, Professor David Blanchflower, the US-based economist who sits on the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told MPs he thought two million people could be out of work by Christmas. He predicted that 2,000 people will lose their jobs every day over the next four months.</p> <p>Since his gloomy forecast, we've seen the demise of XL Airways, putting the company's entire 1,700 workforce at risk, and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which has 5,000 UK-based staff. Job losses Lloyds TSB may be tens of thousands.</p> <p>Job cuts are not confined to the City. Plunging car sales - August was the worst for new car registrations since 1966 - is forcing car makers to scale back production. Fears are mounting that Ford's Southampton plant, employing 1,100 workers, will close and production shifted to Turkey or Romania.</p> <p>Housebuilders have announced big job losses. Barratt announced it would cut a quarter of its workforce, and Persimmon said it would lay off 2,000 staff. Up to 50,000 construction workers have already lost their jobs.</p> <p>And as the property market sags, the gamut of activity around it - from estate agents to removal workers - are suffering. Analysts at Merrill Lynch suggest that a third of all estate agent branches could close.</p> <h2>What's the safest job to have in a credit crisis?</h2> <p>Start with anything that involves profiting from the misfortunes of others. It's bonanza time for insolvency experts. Debt collectors and bailiffs should also stay in work - even if there will be less to grab. </p> <p>Theft always rises in a recession. So jobs in security agencies, the prisons, and the police are all copper-bottomed. And it can't be bad being an insurance loss adjustor dealing with burglaries.</p> <p>Traditional redundancy-proof jobs include undertakers, Church of England vicars, tenured academic staff and most in the health service.</p> <p>But perhaps the safest of all is working as a shelf-stacker in Aldi, the deep-discount supermarket. </p> <h2>What's the least safe job? </h2> <p>Estate agents, property developers and valuation surveyors. And it can't be safe selling Bentleys, Porsches, and Maseratis either as the City bonuses disappear.</p> <p>But it's not just about jobs in finance. Spare a thought for Lycra-clad Sphinx Patterson, who until this week ran fitness classes for Lehman employees. He'll now be looking for more credit and fewer crunches. </p> <h2>Will the state pay my mortgage if I'm unemployed?</h2> <p>At present, anyone losing their job receives no state help towards paying their mortgage for the first 39 weeks of unemployment and, after that, the benefits only cover the interest on the first \u00a3100,000. But the government has anounced there'll be more help from April 2009 when \"income support for mortgage interest (ISMI)\" benefit will be paid on the first \u00a3175,000 and will cut in after just 13 weeks of unemployment for new claimants. </p> <h2>Can I buy insurance for my mortgage payments?</h2> <p>Yes, but the insurers are becoming very picky. Most people taking out a home loan will be able to get mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) from the company offering them the loan. </p> <p>You can also buy standalone MPPI from companies such as <a href=\"http://www.bestinsurance.co.uk\">bestinsurance.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.antinsurance.co.uk\">antinsurance.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.paymentcare.co.uk\">paymentcare.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.britishinsurance.com\">britishinsurance.com</a> </p> <h2>How much will it set me back?</h2> <p>You buy cover for a set amount of monthly mortgage payment, and the policies typically start paying out after a deferment period, such as 30, 60, 90 or 180 days. The longer the waiting period, the cheaper the policy. For example, the cost of covering \u00a3750 of monthly mortgage payments on a 30-day deferment is around \u00a316 a month. But if you're working in an occupation that the insurers currently don't like - such as investment banking or estate agency - you're more than likely be turned down for cover. </p> <h2>What can I claim?</h2> <p>If you work under a contract of employment, whether full or part-time, and you have at least two years' continuous service, your employer should give you a lump sum statutory redundancy. You may also be entitled to other non-statutory payments.</p> <h2>How much do I get?</h2> <p>The amount depends on how long you've worked for your employer, how your service years relate to particular age bands and your weekly pay, up to a legal limit - currently \u00a3330 a week. You can count up to 20 years of continuous service towards a redundancy payment. The age bands give you: half a week's pay for each full year of service up to the age of 21; one week's pay for each year aged 22 up to age 40; and one-and-a-half weeks' pay for each year aged 41 and over. Use the ready reckoner at berr.gov.uk/employment to help work out your entitlement.</p> <h2>Do I pay tax and national insurance on my redundancy payment?</h2> <p>The first \u00a330,000 of any termination payment is tax-free. Over that amount, contact your local tax office.</p> <h2>What if my employer has gone bust and can't pay me?</h2> <p>You may be entitled to payments under employment protection law for any debts the company owes you, such as unpaid salary and holiday pay from the government's Redundancy Payments Office (RPO). </p> <p>The official dealing with your employer's insolvency will normally give you the necessary claim form. You can also get one by calling the redundancy payments helpline on 0845 1450 004 or by downloading one from <a href=\"http://www.insolvency.gov.uk\">insolvency.co.uk</a></p> <h2>Who qualifies?</h2> <p>You'll receive a payment only if you were an employee - directors and other so-called \"office holders\" may not qualify if they have a controlling interest in the business - but there are no limits on age nor service. </p> <h2>What unpaid wages can I claim?</h2> <p>If your insolvent employer owed them to you, you can claim: wages - up to a maximum of eight weeks; holiday pay - up to a maximum of six weeks; redundancy (see above); compensatory notice pay - one week after one calendar month's service rising to one week per year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks. </p> <p>All payments are subject to a maximum of \u00a3330 for a week's wage. Pay includes commission, overtime and guarantee payments. It also includes statutory payments for time off work, or suspension for medical or maternity reasons. Holiday pay and wages are worked out up to the date of insolvency. Redundancy and notice pay from either the date your employer became formally insolvent or when your employment ended, whichever is later. </p> <h2>What about my company pension contributions?</h2> <p>If you have been paying into a pension scheme at work, the pension fund trustees can apply to the government for some of your employer's unpaid contributions to be paid into the scheme.</p> <h2>What happens if I am owed more than the RPO can pay?</h2> <p>Debts remaining, after payment from the National Insurance Fund, may become payable only if sufficient funds are realised from the company's assets. You should claim any outstanding debts from the insolvency practitioner handling your employer's insolvency.</p> <h2>What other state help can I get while I'm unemployed?</h2> <p>You can make benefits claims again by visiting your local Jobcentre Plus in person or by calling 0800 055 66 88 or online at <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/eservice\">dwp.gov.uk/eservice</a>. In each case you'll need your national insurance number plus details of your rent or mortgage, your past employer and your income and savings.</p> <p>If you've paid enough National Insurance you'll qualify for Job Seeker's Allowance, but it's pitifully low: a single person aged 25 or over, for example, gets \u00a360.50 per week, but it's a passport to other benefits. </p> <p>You may be able to get housing benefit if your income and capital are below a certain level. You can't usually get it if you have savings of over \u00a316,000.</p> <h2>Where can I go to for more information?</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The employment section of the Directgov website at <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/employment/employees/fs/en\">direct.gov.uk</a> or ACAS at <a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk\">acas.org.uk</a> or the helpline on 08457 474747.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Information on redundancy rights at or on 0845 145 0004. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Information on company insolvency and employees' rights when a company goes bust at the government's website <a href=\"http://www.insolvency.gov.uk\">insolvency.gov.uk</a> or try the helpline on 0845 602 9848.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Free advice from Citizens Advice.

  "<p>Ruinous legal action - as well as a red card exit - is increasingly the likely result of amateur footballers attempting bone-crunching tackles. And they could be joined by players of other sports, such as golfers, who do not look where they swing their clubs or rugby players who break the rules in scrums and other contact situations.</p> <p>According to insurer esure, sports injuries caused by reckless or negligent actions have become a key source of court actions in the last three years. </p> <p>It says top law firms handling personal liability claims are seeing a fast-growing business from victims of sports injuries, who are becoming aware of their rights to go to law. These claims can easily go into five or six figures - sums that would ruin most players, forcing them to sell their home and possessions.</p> <p>Esure says it can't stop heat-of-the-moment clashes but, along with other insurers, its standard home insurance policy features cover for public liability - \u00a32m in its case. This includes any injury against a third party.</p> <p>Personal liability clauses are little used but the claims that do occur are often large and very serious. </p> <p>Other potential personal liability risks include your home - someone tripping on a carpet; your pets if they cause accident or injury; and bonfire or barbeque incidents.</p>",
  "<p>A good idea will often require additional knowledge that you don't possess and you'll discover you need to do some research in order to make your story convincing. Research comes in many shapes and sizes, from seeking out a forensic pathologist and requesting an interview so you can pin down that serial killer, to spending hours searching through history books, contemporaneous accounts and academic articles over the internet and in the library. Writers of fiction usually aren't academics and so often have a magpie approach to research, going for the shiny bits, easily distracted, forever poking at one idea with their mucky beaks before dropping it and moving on to the next glittering thing. Other writers take it upon themselves to become experts in their chosen subject. But whichever your favoured approach, the most important thing is to pursue your interests. If you think something is absolutely fascinating, it's likely that passion will come through onto the page. </p> <p>Sometimes the most difficult thing about research is knowing when to stop, when to let it go so that you can concentrate on your story. We've all had the experience of reading a novel where the research is too evident on the pages, where the writer feels compelled to jam in every last detail about what kind of buttons that regiment wore on their jackets and where, in fact, those buttons were made, and what, exactly, was the correct way to polish them. It's as though the writer is thinking, I took 10 years to learn all this stuff, so I'm going to damn well share it with you. </p> <p>There's a particular type of very important research that writers often find necessary but don't like to talk about too openly. It's called lying on the sofa, or staring blankly out of the window for ages. This type of research is as important as the time spent observing schizophrenics at the secure unit or hard at it on Wikipedia. Like everyone else, writers need time to dream, and this dream-time can be highly productive and useful. In an interview about how she writes Val McDermid explained how the unconscious plays \"a huge role\" in her work; \"This is the only job (apart from being a sleep-research guinea pig) in which you can work while you're asleep\" If you don't spend time lying on the sofa immersed in the world you are imagining, why would any reader want to lie there as well?</p> <h2>Philippa Gregory on how to research a historical novel</h2> <p>The first rule I apply when writing a historical novel is that it has to work as a novel, as well as be absolutely based on the history. The broad narrative of the history imposes the story of the novel, all I can choose is when to start and stop. The only time I invent an occasion in the life of an historical character is when we simply don't know what they were doing - and then I choose the most likely explanation.</p> <p>But the details of research I only use in service to the story-telling. Thus if a conversation occurs at dinner and we know what is said, that conversation goes into my novel and if we have the exact words so much the better. But the detail of the table setting, the food, and the entertainment only come into the description if it really helps to set the scene, give the atmosphere, animate and illustrate the scene. This means I don't use strange words or technical terms without explanation, and actually, I only use them at all if they help the scene to work as well as a scene in any sort of fiction. However pleased I am to have learned something arcane, it only ever goes into the novel if it adds to the understanding and enjoyment of the reader. </p> <p>Ideally, I should know more as an historian than I tell as a novelist. I should see the scene, and the background to the scene, I should know the means of transport waiting outside the window, and whether the window is glazed. The reader only knows to see the scene, everything else should only help them to see it vividly and to understand its importance. It is called historical fiction and I believe it has to be both: well researched history and well written fiction.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Philippa Gregory's novel, about Mary Queen of Scots, is The Other Queen</p>",
  "<p>Tzipi Livni was a woman in a hurry yesterday. Addressing her first meeting as the leader of Israel's largest party, Kadima, she urged Ehud Olmert to stick to his pledge to resign as prime minister, and said that if she did not succeed in forging a coalition government she would go to the country. She did not have time, she declared breezily, to \"fuss around with politics\". But this is exactly what she now has to do.</p> <p>The next six weeks will prove a big test of her political skills. This is the sort of wheeler-dealing at which the outgoing and discredited Mr Olmert excelled, but at which the current foreign minister is a relative novice. As it is, she faces challenges to her authority, both from within and without her party. Her narrowly defeated rival Shaul Mofaz may have had every personal reason to storm off (having three channels broadcast erroneous exit polls 15 minutes before voting ended would have raised eyebrows in any country) but his abrupt departure creates problems of party unity. Add to that the difficulty of forming a coalition with the ultra-orthodox Shas party, knowing that it will shatter the moment she makes a compromise on Jerusalem with the Palestinians, and the task she faces only grows. Mrs Clean will have to get her hands dirty.</p> <p>For all that, her emergence as a possible prime minister can only be welcomed by anyone who still believes in the possibility of a two-state solution emerging from the ashes of the peace process. These are a dwindling band, it has to be said, driven more by dogged determination than any evidence of real change on the ground. Take whatever snapshot you want, from whatever angle, and the picture is the same. The latest overview of the UN special coordinator for the Middle East, Robert Serry, reaches bleak conclusions. It finds that no agreement has been reached on the substantive issues, that construction is continuing in the majority of 120 settlements on both sides of the separation barrier, and that Gaza continues to deteriorate. There are some positive developments - the release of 198 Palestinian prisoners, the dismantling of a checkpoint allowing 40,000 Palestinians to travel to Ramallah, the slow return of law and order in some parts of the West Bank. But, strategically speaking, it is stalemate.</p> <p>It is Ms Livni's central challenge to break it. It is no use Mr Olmert voicing wise words as he is about to leave office. (He said anyone who believed in a greater Israel from the banks of the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea is deluding themselves.) What the situation demands is a premier who can act on them. Ms Livni is still a long way from having the authority to do so. Only when she acquires it will we discover whether she has what it takes to be a true leader.</p>",
  "<p>Luiz Felipe Scolari spent much of his pre-match briefing yesterday on a charm offensive, lavishing praise on Sir Alex Ferguson and Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of the visit of Manchester United to Stamford Bridge, though he still could not help but lurch into the mischievous at the last. \"Maybe next season Cristiano is with me,\" he muttered. \"Very good. If he wants to change, I'll open the door to that.\"</p> <p>It was said as a joke to lift the mood ahead of an eagerly anticipated collision between the country's leading clubs, yet quite whether Ferguson would see the funny side is open to question. Real Madrid's blatant courting of Ronaldo over the summer has left United uncomfortably sensitive when it comes to any interest, even playfully expressed, in their talismanic forward. The managers are supposed to share a bottle of wine after tomorrow's game. Scolari's quip may just crop up in their post-match conversation.</p> <p>For all Ferguson's shielding, Scolari is close to Ronaldo, having worked with him for five years with Portugal. It was the Brazilian who handed him his first cap, against Kazakhstan in August 2003, and who gave him the captaincy - albeit in honour of the late president of the Portuguese Football Federation - a day after his 22nd birthday in a friendly against Brazil in February 2007. \"When I arrived in Portugal, Ronaldo was just a kid,\" he recalled. \"A young boy of 17. But, even then, he had a good character and it was clear he was going to become a good professional.</p> <p>\"He was already thinking about his future. He's improved himself in the years since. Next season I can see him as a captain with Portugal because people like him and he has the confidence to succeed in that. He's a very good man, he helps the other players, and has a good attitude on and off the pitch. He has grown up, matured. He is a better player now than he was two years ago, and he is my friend. I like him as a father likes his son\"</p> <p>Scolari has been at pains since Euro 2008 to stress that he never advised Ronaldo to leave United for Real. \"All we spoke about in the summer were the Euros,\" he said, a reference to the tournament rather than the currency. Tomorrow, he expects to confront the 23-year-old from the outset. \"He'll start,\" he added. \"I know him.\"</p> <p>Scolari has yet really to get to know Ferguson. Their brushes in the past have been limited to an Intercontinental Cup match in Tokyo some nine years ago, and numerous telephone calls from Portugal checking up on the fitness of Ronaldo and Nani. Ferguson has rarely warmed to his direct rivals in recent times, but Scolari will welcome the Scot to Stamford Bridge with open arms.</p> <p>\"I am an opponent only on the pitch,\" he said. \"We had a coaches' meeting with Uefa 15 days ago and all the coaches got on well. Not just Ferguson, but Ars\u00e8ne [Wenger], [the Bordeaux manager] Laurent Blanc, [Roma's] Luciano Spalletti. I've spoken to Cristiano about Alex and he only has good words about him. His players respect him as a coach and as a father figure, and as a friend. We don't have a 'good' relationship only because I've only met him two or three times so far.\"</p> <p>Relations between these clubs have been more strained in recent times. The post-match fracas at Stamford Bridge in April - Chelsea are contesting a Football Association charge of failing to keep their groundsman under control, while Patrice Evra will attend a personal hearing next month after being charged with improper conduct - was regrettable, while memories are still fresh from May's Champions League final. Scolari has not watched a rerun of that game in the build-up to tomorrow's re-match. Victory would edge his side nine points clear of the champions. His assertion that such a gulf \"means nothing at this stage of the season\" can be dismissed as readily as his assessment of Ronaldo's availability.</p>",
  "<p>The American businessman Stan Kroenke was appointed to the Arsenal board yesterday as the club reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a336.7m for the year ending May 2008.</p> <p>The move will be interpreted by many as an attempt to forestall any takeover bid by the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov who owns 24% of the club's shares. Kroenke has agreed not to increase his stake, currently 12.4%, beyond 29.9% of Arsenal's share capital in the next year unless a takeover bid is launched by Usmanov or another party, in which case he could do so with the consent of the board. Usmanov had been bound by a six-month agreement preventing him from making a takeover bid for the club but that expired at the end of August.</p> <p>Red &amp; White Holdings, the biggest shareholder and controlled by Usmanov, felt the appointment showed that the board was grooming a \"more acceptable\" figure to buy it out in years to come. It felt that the invitation to the American contrasted with the limited contact it has accorded Red &amp; White over the last year. </p> <p>The Arsenal directors insist they have no intention of turning their back on the club, pointing to the existence of a lock-down agreement, which prohibits share sales to any but \"permitted persons\" before October 2010, as evidence. But Kroenke is on the board despite refusing to sign the lock-down. Indeed, although Kroenke issued a \"no-bid\" statement confirming he would not attempt to buy the club for 12 months, it carried the caveat that he would do so if he obtains the board's consent.</p> <p>Despite the politicking, Kroenke's skills are a good fit with Arsenal's ambitions to match Chelsea's global reach. The owner of several US sports franchises, Kroenke already controls Arsenal's broadband-internet business.</p> <p>\"I hope that my background in sports management will be an asset to Arsenal in its commercial dealings going forward,\" said Kroenke. It is clear from the announcement yesterday of Arsenal's annual results that any extra income will be welcomed. Although pre-tax profit rose on \u00a3223m turnover, the margins have been squeezed by a 13% leap in players' wages to \u00a3101.3m and a \u00a350m increase in debts.</p> <p>Most worrying for Arsenal is the outlook regarding their various property interests. In the last set of accounts the chairman, Peter Hill-Wood, forecast turnover of \u00a3350m from developments at the old stadium site, Highbury Square, and nearby Queensland Road. But it is understood the board has requested daily updates on sales of Highbury Square flats, with one in 12 of those currently marketed unsold.</p> <p>Arsenal's small shareholders believe this is the club's overriding concern. \"It is very clear that the anticipated sale of the Queensland Road site for a hoped-for \u00a380m is not achievable in the current market environment,\" said the Arsenal Supporters' Trust. \"Arsenal acknowledge this by stating that any surplus cash from property sales should be treated as a bonus and previous talk of a \u00a3100m surplus can be firmly dismissed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Though Julian Joseph, like a less messianic Wynton Marsalis, has long defended the lessons of the jazz tradition and of improvisation on unplugged instruments, his earliest allegiances were to dance-based jazz - it was the music of Herbie Hancock's Headhunters that turned him on to jazz piano in the first place.

  "<p>The turmoil on Wall Street this week has played havoc with the wealth of the United States' super-rich, threatening the position of the investment expert Warren Buffett as the country's second-richest businessman and decimating the paper fortunes of financiers and investors.</p> <p>The latest list of the US top 400, published by the business magazine Forbes this week, estimated American fortunes as of the end of August. Since then the market has experienced some of the most dramatic swings ever and the list now looks like a window into a bygone world.</p> <p>Earlier this year Buffett, the legendary stock-picker dubbed the Sage of Omaha after his Nebraskan home, briefly overtook Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as America's richest man.</p> <p>Since then the Dow Jones has been on a rollercoaster ride, Lehman Brothers has become the world's largest-ever bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch has been forced into a shotgun wedding with Bank of America, AIG has been bailed out by the US government and Morgan Stanley sent looking for its own saviour.</p> <p>Worries about the credit crunch had already reduced Buffett's fortune by $12bn (\u00a36.6bn) over the six months to the time the list was compiled on August 29, leaving Gates in the top spot with a net worth of $57bn. Buffett is worth $50bn. Although he has a reputation for making astute financial judgments, he would have needed to be on top form over the past five days to benefit from the dramatic swings on Wall Street.</p> <p>AIG's woes earlier in the year had already pushed one of the insurance group's major shareholders, Eli Broad, down to No 48 on the list with an estimated wealth of $6.7bn. A well-known philanthropist, he sold his SunAmerica business to AIG and the proceeds have helped not only his adoptive city of Los Angeles but the nation's art dealers. He owns the world's largest collection of works by Jeff Koons and once bought a painting by Roy Lichtenstein for $2.5m using a credit card. The government bailout of AIG, however, will have significantly hit his wallet since the Forbes 400 list was compiled.</p> <p>It is unlikely that art will retain its value in the current slump, despite the record-breaking Damien Hirst sale earlier this week. This will come as a shock to Donald and Doris Fisher, the founders of the Gap clothing chain, who returned to the list in joint 377th place - on $1.3bn - thanks to their $1bn art collection.</p> <p>The pair share their spot with the former Citigroup boss Sandy Weill, who can expect the turmoil to have hit the value of the bank's shares he still owns. The position of the Texan banker and fellow Citigroup shareholder Gerald J Ford, listed at No 355 with $1.4bn, also looks rocky.</p> <p>Wall Street's crash and the demise of Lehman Brothers will have hit the $15bn fortune of 15th-placed Abigail Johnson. Her family runs Fidelity Investments, which is understood to have funds with some of the highest exposure to both the collapsed investment bank and AIG. Her father Edward is placed at No 28 with $11bn, level with George Soros.</p> <p>Soros ranks highest among those in the Fortune 400 whose wealth comes from hedge funds and private equity, and it is unlikely that all the other 23 in the list who have made their money the same way will be there in a year's time.</p> <p>The Bridgewater Associates boss, Ray Dalio, is ranked at No 78 with $4.5bn, while the Och-Ziff hedge fund co-founder Daniel Och is at No 95 on $3.9bn. Also at No 78 is John Paulson, who has made millions for his funds over the past year by betting against sub-prime assets. The firm's Credit Opportunities fund was up 590%, net of fees, last year. </p> <p>As well as wiping out billions in paper fortunes as share prices collapse, and perhaps raising billions more for shrewd investors, the impact of the turmoil in banking is likely to hit other industries.</p> <p>Particularly vulnerable is Michael Bloomberg, who is in eighth place, with $20bn. The collapses and mergers in the financial industry are likely to significantly reduce demand for the news and trading terminals that bear his name.</p> <p>Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page come in at 13 and 14 with $15.9bn and $15.8bn respectively. Lawrence Ellison, boss of Oracle, comes in third at $27bn, while spaces four, five and six are taken up with the Wal-Mart dynasty, who together control more than 39% of the grocery chain. Jim Walton comes in fourth at $23.4bn; his elder brother Robson Walton is in fifth on $23.3bn, and their sister Alice is joint sixth with $23.2bn.</p> <p>Finally, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg can afford a wry smile. At 24, he is the youngest member of the Forbes 400, thanks to the $15bn valuation placed on the social networking site when Microsoft took its 1.6% stake last year. His fortune puts him at number 321.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Branson was supposed to be announcing the launch of Virgin hotels in New York next week. That particular expansion of his empire will now have to wait, after the project's investment partner - Lehman Brothers - went bust. This was also the week when the chief executive of British Airways declared the airline industry was facing its deepest crisis ever. But sipping wine beside a pool in the south of France, Branson is talking about buying a stake in Gatwick, which went up for sale this week, and his ideas for how to make it the best airport in the world.</p> <p>\"If you have a nice drink or flowers handed to you by friendly people when you arrive at an airport, you'll feel this country is welcoming you.\" Cold drinks and flowers for every passenger arriving at Gatwick - is he serious?</p> <p>\"Why not?\"</p> <p>It is just the sort of detail you might find in his new book, Business Stripped Bare. The book's central theme is live-the-dream stuff - follow your heart, have fun, give your customers a great time and you'll enjoy the ride, and so on - a philosophy endorsed by his schedule; at least, if arrangements for this interview are anything to go by. First it was to be in New York, where a window opened in his diary thanks to a decision to watch Andy Murray in the US Open final. Then it was Mallorca - but then he was off to Portugal to open Virgin health clubs - and today he will be in South Africa to open a centre for disease control with President Mbeki, before flying to New York to set sail in a bid to break the record for the fastest transatlantic crossing. We manage to meet at his mother's home in the south of France during a fleeting family visit, where we tootle along canals in a leaky speedboat, bailing out water to much hilarity.</p> <p>\"My general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day. I never do anything with a feeling of, 'Oh God, I've got to do this today.'\"</p> <p>It's a vintage Branson line - the embodiment of the Virgin brand. The only thing is, it's oddly unconvincing.</p> <p>In person, Branson is surprisingly awkward, even gauche. Throughout a two-hour interview he makes eye contact almost never, and picks his words with distinctly corporate on-message care. In his book, as in all Branson's PR, he presents himself as a dauntless wildcard - even a wacky liability - but I've seldom met anyone who looked less in danger of putting his foot in it. </p> <p>Having \"had a feeling\" about a looming credit crunch two and half years ago, and liquidated chunks of the Virgin empire, Branson is irritated that other companies are now being rescued. </p> <p>\"Yes there would have been a lot of pain out there, but I don't think it's the government's job to step in and rescue companies. The way you get rid of recessions is to let the inefficient companies disappear.\"</p> <p>He echoes this week's warning from BA's Willie Walsh that we're going to see more big casualties in the airline industry. \"I think one or two of the big American carriers are likely to go.\" But he is deeply cynical about Walsh's motives for talking about the \"worst crisis ever\", and claims: \"He has an ulterior motive, because he's basically attempting to achieve a merger of the two biggest airlines in the world [BA and American Airlines], both financially very strong, but he's trying to use the excuse of financial poverty suddenly in order to get the competition authorities to waive what will be an unholy alliance of two giants.\"</p> <p>But the feud - like so many of his other high-profile battles, against BSkyB, Coca-cola, Camelot and, over Northern Rock, the government - does have a serendipitous branding side-effect. Simply by appearing to take on the big boys, the impression is left that Branson would have liked to hand out drinks and flowers, and that if only Virgin did own Gatwick it would be brilliant.</p> <p>He has also successfully branded himself as the corporate world's leading climate change campaigner. A former sceptic, two years ago he was converted by Al Gore, and famously pledged to invest 100% of Virgin's transport profits in research for clean fuels. So I'm somewhat taken aback when he enthusiastically brings up Nigel Lawson's recent book, An Appeal To Reason, which disputes the basic premise of man-made climate change. Does he mean it's won him back to the sceptic position?</p> <p>\"Um, erm ... well I started out by reading The Sceptical Environmentalist, and the last book I've read was Nigel Lawson's. I've read a lot of books in between - The Weather Makers, and James Lovelock's books. And, well I mean - I'd love to get Lovelock and Lawson around the table and just let them talk, it would be brilliant.\" So does he think Lawson has a point? \"Um, I think that it would be - I think it's important in life to question everything.\"</p> <p>He says the most important thing is to invest in alternative fuels, if only as \"an insurance policy\". We should, he adds firmly, \"all reduce our carbon output - somewhat.\" But how much? \"I don't know, it's just a balancing act.\" I ask where he locates that balance. \"Well we've got a lovely home in the Caribbean, and I can afford to turn it into a carbon neutral island, which I'm in the process of doing. So hopefully people can use that as an example. And where possible I'll travel commercial, you know sometimes I travel private.\" Does he feel guilty about his carbon footprint? \"Of course I do. But out of guilt we have committed to do a lot, and hopefully we'll have some major breakthroughs.\"</p> <p>As we stroll around town, he is greeted by smiles and waves. People want autographs and pictures, and cry out \"Monsieur Richard!\". No other businessman is so globally recognised or loved - despite no obviously discernible towering mind or huge personality. But his unshakable belief in the happy convergence of his private interests and the greater public good appears to have made him, and everybody else, happy.</p> <p>I wonder whether, after his conversion by Al Gore, he ever considered selling his airlines. He gives a slightly uncomfortable grin. \"Obviously I sat in the bath and went through the various options. Selling the airline wouldn't have done any good, because the planes would just have been operated by somebody else. So I believe the option of putting all the profits into research is a better thing to do.\" But had he not owned any airlines at that point, surely he wouldn't since have started one? Branson pauses for a second.</p> <p>\"I think so. Yes, I would.\"</p> <p>Business Stripped Bare by Richard Branson is published this month by Virgin Books at \u00a320.

  "<p><strong>Tonight</strong></p> <p><strong>John Denham</strong> will address the <strong>Compass/Tribune rally</strong> explaining how the party needs to go \"beyond redistribution\" to achieve social justice.

In the afternoon <strong>David Miliband</strong> will give his speech as foreign secretary, and though it is scheduled firmly within an afternoon of global affairs, the worry for Brown will be that if the speech has a certain something that Brown's can't match, coming the day before the prime minister stands up, the contrast will be all too apparent. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Caroline Flint</strong> and <strong>Hazel Blears</strong> will deliver the morning's speeches before the conference hall fills up for <strong>Gordon Brown's</strong> speech after lunch at 2pm.

  "<p>\"Eagerly awaited\" is a claim that usually carries a squeal of optimism, a dash of spin, the book's readership quietly enthusiastic rather than salivating at the bookshop door. However, five years after Notes on a Scandal - a novel that was Booker-shortlisted, translated into 29 languages and adapted into an Oscar-nominated film - Zo\u00eb Heller's latest offering, The Believers, is, quite genuinely, eagerly awaited. </p> <p>This third novel is more mature than Notes on a Scandal, and radically different in tone and subject matter. The Believers is at heart an American novel: a larger, more considered, layered and utterly assured study of a family driven by political passion whose personal lives refuse to comply with prescribed ideology. </p> <p>In a 1962 prologue, Audrey Howard meets the politically fervent, loud and energetic Joel Litvinoff while living a quiet London life as a typist. On their second meeting, he suggests she elope with him to his native America and she accepts the challenge. Forward to 2002 New York, neatly avoiding the heartsink of yet another 9/11 novel with glimpses of Ground Zero, and Joel is a celebrated radical lawyer, while Audrey has spent her life upholding both the uncompromising socialist politics the couple espouse and the almost mythical creation that is her husband. </p> <p>The Believers focuses on this American-English Jewish family shortly after Joel suffers a stroke in the courtroom. His subsequent coma precipitates the unravelling of a family whose supposed political unity has always - quite naturally - been riddled with hypocrisies and clashing convictions. Audrey is by now a hilarious, foul-mouthed harridan: part monster, part inspiring law unto herself, her approach so excoriatingly direct that the reader waits in wincing glee for her next spitting and swearing tirade. The \"mark of her unparalleled intimacy with the legend\" that is Joel is a \"deadpan unimpressibility\". She's always been a reluctant mother, but a flicker of maternal impulse is inspired by her adopted son Lenny, to whose drug addiction and wastrel ways she is oblivious, while her two biological daughters, Karla and Rosa, receive little beyond scornful chastisements and dictates about how to live their lives.</p> <p>Rosa has spent four years in Cuba, wedded to the cause of revolutionary socialism. She had imagined herself \"striding along in history's vanguard, like one of those muscular heroines in a Soviet constructivist poster\", only to return to New York and attend an Orthodox synagogue. To her atheist family, this is an outrage. </p> <p>Karla is the rejected, overweight oldest child, abused guardian of family delusions (\"there was something in the brutal candour of her mother's sallies that pleased her\"), and now the unhappy wife of a man who both resents and looks up to the feted Litvinoffs. An entirely unexpected adulteress, she begins an affair with a man she meets through work. The Litvinoff children's \"impeccably progressive, internationalist upbringing\" among liberal intelligentsia has left them naive in many ways. Dogma has replaced emotion.</p> <p>Joel's prognosis is increasingly grim: Rosa is left to struggle with her faith, Lenny with his addictions, and Audrey with everyone she encounters. Into the drama strolls Berenice Mason, armed with proof of her longterm affair with Joel in the form of a young son and paternity payments. This cracks even Audrey's carapace, and the resulting abusive outbursts are gems. </p> <p>The Believers is an astonishingly well-observed slow burner, its virtuoso prose compressed and beautiful. Zo\u00eb Heller possesses true brilliance as a writer. Whether this novel hangs together cohesively is another matter: its intention is at times elusive, its momentum uneven. Despite the buildup of multiple viewpoints and dilemmas, the story itself maintains only a light hold on the reader, its hooks less deep than those of Notes on a Scandal, a novel whose sinister monomania extended an ever-tightening grip. Heller can only be admired for her refusal to crowd-please and for her almost cussed choice of subject matter, but extended scenes of dialogue can lose impact and slow the pace.</p> <p>As a large, intelligent and stunningly written novel of a dysfunctional New York family, The Believers is strongly reminiscent of Claire Messud's The Emperor's Children. The Litvinoffs' knee-jerk 60s radicalism could be an easy target for mockery, but Heller's touch is light, and she reserves her more vicious satire for the bit-part players. This is a subtle, funny and dark family farce about faith and identity. It fails to satisfy completely, but in its thundering confidence and lyricism, The Believers is the work of a writer at the top of her game.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sleep With Me by Joanna Briscoe is published by Bloomsbury</p>",
  "<p>My father was one of the top golfers in the 1920s and 1930s before the war interrupted his efforts. His approach to golf was straightforward and he taught me that, fundamentally, golf is a very simple game made difficult by people. He told me that it was what you did before you swung the club that mattered rather than the swing itself, which is over in seconds: the grip, stance, flexing of your knees and aim all have to be correct. I think of this when people say to me, \"I get so far in my back swing and then I break my wrists and it all goes wrong.\" No! The mistakes were made long before the backswing.</p> <p>The older I've got, the more I realise that it's the people with the most information above the chin and the stoutest heart that do well in golf - to succeed you have to have guts and learn to control your emotions.</p> <p>My father believed too that it was important not to over-coach people; that they had to find out things for themselves by asking questions like \"Why did that work?\" or \"Why do I like that?\". In this way I developed my analytical skills which have stood me in great stead in my career in general, not just on the golf course. </p> <p>Once the TV work came along, the course of my life changed. I was invited by Ray Lakeland, a sports producer, to commentate on the Open championship. He had been sitting behind me and heard my explanation on why I hadn't won a competition and liked the way I talked. I was just thrown in and told to get on with it - hence my relaxed, chatty style of commentary. But even here I felt my father's influence because I learned from watching others and asking myself questions. </p> <p>Jack Hargreaves was one of the TV people I learned from, although I never met him. He had a programme called Out of Town some 40 years ago. He was a rustic fellow who sat in a shed wearing a battered old hat, smoking a pipe and ruminating on rural life. I marvelled at his amiable and relaxed presenting style; he was one of the best communicators I've ever seen - he made it look simple, a great art.</p> <p>Cliff Michelmore is another person whose presentation style I hugely admire. Among many important things I learned from him was, during an interview, to always sit forward in my seat and to never wear short socks - an expanse of bare, white leg is never a good look on TV.</p> <p>My writing was greatly influenced by the journalist Henry Longhurst who instilled a confidence in me that I could indeed write competently. </p> <p>I've never been ambitious, just lucky - I've travelled the world talking about golf and, in many ways, it doesn't get much better than that. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> His book Golf - The Cure for a Grumpy Old Man is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton</p>",
  "<p>When I started my own business I was blinded by the prospect of being rich and famous. If you've read Richard Branson's autobiography, you can't fail to be impressed by the man's chutzpah. How a guy with limited means and little in the way of formal education can now, seemingly, do whatever he likes - and spend a lot of time mucking about in big balloons - while becoming unfathomably richer.</p> <p>Unfortunately mine isn't one of those success stories. I'm not a household name and I certainly didn't make my fortune. In fact I had no real intention or ambition to get into the \"adult\" business and if anything I consider myself a bit of a prude. </p> <p>For most of my 20s, I did a very sensible job in the shipping industry. Not exactly a high flyer, but I had big plans. I worked with a great team of people and had travelled to far-off places. But shortly after my 30th birthday, I decided my life had to take a different course. I felt a desperate, powerful yearning to do something different, something off the wall, something crazy, something risky. So I left the colleagues who were like family, and the comfort and security of a job I'd done for most of my adult life. And I became a pornographer.</p> <p>In 2002, along with eccentric editor Rowan Pelling, I purchased for \u00a31 the Erotic Review - a famous but ailing literary erotic magazine read by retired colonels and, generally, well-educated posh people. Heady with ambition and dreams of fame and fortune we set about relaunching the magazine. </p> <p>The Regent Street office of the Erotic Review was like nothing I'd seen before. From the outside it looked like the sort of place you might find full of bankers wearing braces and talking about murdering wildlife at weekends. Inside it looked like it had been ransacked by a gang of German perverts. It was awash with books, filthy magazines, sex toys, lingerie, fruit, erotic artwork and, peculiarly, loose toilet rolls. The windows were nailed shut and there was a dead pigeon trapped on the sill of my little room.</p> <p>But the magazine itself was brilliant and original. It was rude, sexy and intelligent - and it offered advertisers access to a very desirable market, namely horny old men with money.</p> <p>Having raised \u00a355,000 from the equity in our homes, we successfully relaunched with a series of themed issues that included May's Eastern Karma Sutra edition and the September Suck-it-on-Sea special. We pulled in interviews with Tracey Emin, Anthony Bourdain, AC Grayling and Nick Cave and targeted a younger market with a regular sex toy page. We set up a couple of chat lines and <a href=\"http://www.Poshtotty.com\">Poshtotty.com</a> - a website for posh ladies who liked to take their clothes off.</p> <p>We struck a deal with Waterstones and Borders to stock the magazine and after just a couple of weeks we'd added 1,000 readers to our existing list of 10,000 subscribers. M&amp;C Saatchi were knocking on the door, pitching for our advertising spend.</p> <p>But like many first-time entrepreneurs we dreamed about the upside only to be confronted with the cold stark reality of a downside. </p> <p>We'd paid only \u00a31 for the magazine, but had taken on \u00a330,000 of debts - which creditors were calling in. After four months, we had run out of cash.</p> <p>We secured \u00a3200,000 from investors, but were losing \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 a month, spending more money acquiring subscribers than we were making from them in revenue. Eighteen months on, <a href=\"http://www.Poshtotty.com\">Poshtotty.com</a> was being filled with shots of cheap east European girls with dead eyes. Our advertising sales executive had quit to sell ads for fetish magazine Skin Two, a prostitute was threatening to sue us for slander and our accountants were taking us to court for not paying them on time.</p> <p>We were forced to sell the business to another publishing company, Dennis, and I received \u00a325,000, precisely the same amount that I'd put in. As I was signing some of the sales papers in its offices, in walked Felix Dennis, owner of the company, magazine magnate and author of How To Get Rich. Here was my hero, a man I had always hoped to meet on an equal level. Instead I felt small and insignificant. He had made a fortune from magazines. My first one had lost me a pile of money. I felt like a failure.</p> <p>But the notion of business failure has continued to intrigue me. I have come across many entrepreneurs who harbour a dark secret in their closet: a failure. But almost without exception they have learned from their mistakes and carried on - in many instances to make more mistakes.</p> <p>What did I learn from our mistakes? Never stop worrying about where all the money comes from and who needs to be paid. Nearly all entrepreneurs I know can tell you yesterday's sales figures to the nearest tenner and what their bank balance is. The other mantra I learned during my first experience of running a business was \"turnover is vanity, profit is sanity\".</p> <p>I took these practical lessons and launched a women's magazine which I sold earlier this year. And in the past few months I have launched a magazine and website to tap into the growing demand for cosmetic surgery. </p> <p>People ask me how I picked myself up to do it all again? Because I'd been given a taste of something I hadn't expected when we first planned our quest for publishing domination - freedom. Starting a business doesn't guarantee you happiness or wealth; but with the Erotic Review I had discovered the incredible feeling of waking up in the morning and knowing that I alone control my destiny. I know the targets I need to achieve because I'm the one who pays the salary bill at the end of the month. Having discussed this with other business owners over the years, I've realised that freedom, above anything else, is the reason most people do it. </p> <p>Let's be honest - many people engaged in entrepreneurial pursuits do so because they couldn't get a job anywhere else. They're the misfits of the world - some end up running it, while others end up flogging lighters from a suitcase. Between these two extremes many of us toil away with small internet retailers, sandwich shops and carpet cleaning franchises content in the knowledge that there will be no-one breathing down our necks come 9am on Monday morning. </p> <p>These are trying times. Money is harder to come by, banks and customers are tightening their belts. But downturns can be a good time to try your hand at starting your own business. Disney opened its studio doors during the recession of 1923, Hewlett Packard began life during the Depression, and Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft amid the 1970s oil crisis. The greatest lesson I learned is that there is nothing to be afraid of. Five months into my first, failing venture - struggling for cash, with a new wife, big mortgage and a kiddie on the way - I wasn't frightened. I found it utterly exhilarating.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Gavin Griffith's The Accidental Pornographer is published by Capstone</p>",
  "<h2>Can I cover myself against airlines going bust and Eurotunnel fires</h2> <p>Contrary to most buyers' beliefs, the overwhelming majority of travel insurance policies do not cover scheduled airlines going to the wall. The Post Office, Swiftcover and the little known Karma insurance are the only insurers picking up the pieces in Zoom-styles bankruptcies.</p> <p>However, you can buy a \u00a34 policy to add to your current one that will pay \u00a35,000 if your travel firm goes bust. InsureFor, the internet insurer, offers a standalone policy covering supplier failure. It promises to provide an alternative holiday or a replacement journey in the event of major travel disruption or a business failure. </p> <p>InsureFor's annual worldwide cover costs \u00a38 per person. Single trip cover is just \u00a34 per person. You can claim up to \u00a35,000 less a \u00a350 excess if supplier can't provide the holiday services you paid for. </p> <p>The policies should particularly appeal to independent travellers who book their own cheap flights and hotel rooms direct, as well as regular users of low-cost airlines. If you already have a standard travel policy, there's nothing to stop you buying this cover on top. Go to InsureFor's subsidiary website, <a href=\"http://www.supplierfailurecover.com\">supplierfailurecover.com</a>. </p> <p>We got quotes for a family of four for worldwide annual multi-trip insurance from <a href=\"http://www.karmainsurance.com\">karmainsurance.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk\">postoffice.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.swiftcover.com\">swiftcover.com</a> that include airline failure. The prices ranged from \u00a372 to \u00a3126.</p> <h2>Which airline is most at risk of going bust?</h2> <p>According to the betting firm Paddy Power, which enterprisingly has opened a book on just this issue, Alitalia is the clear favourite (odds of 5-4) followed by SpanAir at 3-1. Other firms on the receiving end of bets are Skyeurope and FlyGlobespan - both 5-1. AirBerlin is currently 7-1 and Wizz Air is 14-1. Just because an airline is on this list, it does not mean it is in trouble - check out <a href=\"http://www.Paddypower.com\">Paddypower.com</a>. If you are booked with an at-risk airline, make sure you are covered - particularly if you booked using a debit card.</p> <h2>And which is least likely to?</h2> <p>Interestingly, the giant no-frills airlines, Ryanair and Easyjet, are not considered at any risk of failing - you only get odds of 100-1 (the same as British Airways) that they'll fold. And the airline which the bookmakers think is the least likely to go bankrupt? Vatican Airlines, at 500-1. But Paddy Power will also offer you 1000-1 odds that Air Force One, the US President's plane, will be permanently grounded. </p> <h2>For what are you covered?</h2> <p>Anyone buying a holiday (flight and accommodation) from a tour operator or travel agent is automatically covered in the event the firm goes bust under the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) - the financial protection scheme for UK tour operators.</p> <p>If you are in the middle of your package holiday when the company goes down, the Atol scheme, overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority, will pay for you to be repatriated - and any hotel bills you were entitled to under your original booking. If your holiday is yet to happen, Atol will refund all the money you have paid, although you may have to wait a few weeks/months.</p> <h2>What about travel agents on the web?</h2> <p>Anyone buying a flight and hotel package bought from a website would be covered by the Atol rules. However, all flights purchased directly from an airline's website or from a travel agent which is booking the flight directly on your behalf are NOT. It is imperative to pay by credit card - or if you must, a Visa debit card - or have suitable insurance (see below).</p> <h2>What about credit card cover?</h2> <p>Assuming the flight cost more than \u00a3100, the credit card company is jointly liable to provide the service. If the airline fails, you will be able to reclaim a full refund of the flight from the card provider. If you're abroad when the airline fails, your credit company should pay half the total fare you originally paid, and is responsible for the cost of getting you home. Even if the cheapest fare you can find to get home is \u00a3500 - the credit card company has to pick up the bill \"to put you back in the same position that you would have been had the airline not failed\".</p> <h2>Do I need insurance if I only buy package holidays?</h2> <p>No - you can rely on the Atol scheme.</p> <h2>Debit cards - any cover?</h2> <p>Visa debit card users may be partially covered. The issuing banks have been processing \"chargebacks\" but you only get the money you lost - and you have to get yourself home. Anyone booking flights only using a Maestro or Connect debit card will lose their money - and will have to pay to get home.</p> <h2>What about discount flights bought from agents?</h2> <p>To further complicate matters, the Atol scheme will cover some (discounted) flights bought from travel agents - where the ticket was previously registered, and is effectively being sold on. Agents booking flights from airlines on your behalf don't offer cover. When buying a discounted flight from an agent, ask if the ticket sale is covered by Atol rules. You should be given an invoice with an Atol number on it.</p> <h2>Are holidays going to become more expensive? </h2> <p>Probably. Remaining operators will be able to start pushing up prices. </p> <h2>Should I buy holiday money now?</h2> <p>Not unless you spend colossal amounts. The hot money is on sterling weakening against the dollar a little further, but holding its ground against the euro. Analysts reckon that the crunch will hit continental Europe with full force later this year, sending the euro spinning.</p>",
  "<h2>Paedophile hotline scheme prompts arrest</h2> <p>A man has been arrested after a call to a \"Sarah's Law\" pilot scheme phone line, police said. The scheme, launched on Monday, allows parents in Peterborough, Southampton, Stockton-on-Tees, and Warwickshire to ask police if anyone with access to their children has convictions for child sex offences. Warwickshire police said four calls had been received, with one prompting \"immediate action\". The year-long pilots were launched in response to demands from parents to know the locations of convicted paedophiles. The campaign for a law was launched after the murder of Sarah Payne in 2000. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Hospital closes after C difficile kills patient</h2> <p>A patient has died after an outbreak of Clostridium difficile at a community hospital, it was disclosed yesterday.

It is now closed to admissions. NHS West Kent said there had been two other deaths, but post-mortem results showed they were due to \"other non-related causes\".

  "<p>My first one was a dizzying 10ft above ground and infested with earwigs. The latest was forced on me by children chanting: \"We want a treehouse!\" A couple of days after it was built, tired of rescuing stranded children, I took the ladder away. Despite these experiences, the magic of the treehouse refuses to die. I think there must be some deep, instinctual memory of chimp-like times when we nested in the forest canopy. Anthropologists may be convinced we spent thousands of years living in caves, but I reckon the truth is that the cave-dwellers were the mavericks and most of us lived in the woods. Nobody loves damp, spidery caves, but we all adore big cuddly trees. </p> <p>Globally, the treehouse phenomena took off a while ago, but the UK has lagged, stuck in the old-door-and-rusty-nail era of arboreal living. Where is the Great British treehouse? I started my search in Alnwick, where the Duchess of Northumberland led the way in 2005, opening a vast treehouse in her grounds to accompany her poison garden, cascades and various nouveau-renaissance features, including water jets that playfully squirt the unwary. </p> <p>The gardens went down well with Niall (12) and Maddy (5) - at least they were both happily soaked within an hour. The treehouse, however, didn't grab their imagination. The size of three tennis courts, it holds a restaurant, toilets, coffee bar and information centre. But there lies its downfall: no sense of being in another dimension in the treetops. Five-year-old Maddy's inner-Hobbit was better satisfied by running wildly across the rope bridges slung nearby. </p> <p>Other wealthy individuals have followed the duchess, judging by the growing number of bespoke treehouse builders. But what about that ineffable sense of aerial living? (For example, check out <a href=\"http://www.freespiritspheres.com\">freespiritspheres.com</a> for the spherical treehouses of Canada.) I wanted a treehouse to stay in, but also one that pricked my imagination.</p> <p>Last time I tried to sleep in a tree I was driven out by the earwigs; this time I wanted something more pleasant. Forest Holidays, a public-private partnership between the Forestry Commission and the Camping and Caravanning Club, has two treehouses, with plans for more to follow. I went to the site at Cropton Forest, a 9,000-acre stretch of woodland and plantation on the southern flanks of the North Yorkshire Moors that's home to goshawks, barn owls and Keldy Cabins, a rather swanky row of penthouses masquerading as log cabins. </p> <p>Arriving in the early evening, most other guests were already ensconced in front of their plasma screens or else soaking in the hot tubs. A few, however, were on the verandas listening to the screech of barn owls.</p> <p>The treehouse at Cabin 14 is actually a stilted house wrapped around a scots pine. \"I'm afraid belting a few nails into a tree wasn't an option,\" explained Lance Merryfield, the construction manager for Wood Brothers of Portsmouth who built it. \"We couldn't even lop any branches. The trick is to build something that will be safe, and long-lasting, then make it look like it's off the set of Harry Potter.\"</p> <p>They certainly succeeded in that respect: a rope bridge leads to a crooked door and then a delightfully asymmetrical room, two thirds of an octagon, where rustic features pepper what is really an upmarket hotel room. For a moment, I mourned the end of the rusty-nail era, then I settled in, marvelling at the journey that has led the Forestry Commission to this - a government department notorious for its monotonous wildernesses of fir trees is now sanctioning mock Harry Potter treehouses. How did that happen?</p> <p>Set up in 1919, the Commission picked up former grouse moors such as Cropton, then Keldy Castle estate, and covered them in ranks of coniferous trees - scots pine and douglas fir mainly. \"Mostly they were growing pit props,\" says Russ Varley, the forest ranger who takes me on a deerstalking walk through a wet and rainy Cropton. Those familiar deserts of fir are still around, but are now mixed with more varied woodland and patches of beech.</p> <p>Russ stops to show me a roe deer print. \"That's a fresh track - look at the edges - still sharp, despite the rain.\"</p> <p>The changes in forestry started to bite in the 1980s: cheap imports and failing demand for pit props on one hand, requirements of leisure on the other. The result was a dramatic change in thinking about commercial woodland and its uses - the start of a long road that would lead to treehouses.</p> <p>\"Clear-felling plantations meant species never had long enough to get established,\" explains Russ, who is examining a birch tree for signs of what he calls deer-fraying - nibbling to non-specialists. \"Now they allow some areas to remain and diversify.\"</p> <p>It is hard to overstate the importance of the sea change in forestry policy. With a woodland area five times the size of Greater London under its control, the commission controls more than a quarter of Britain's forests. That is an enormous sanctuary for nature, but also a place for our expectations and dreams of what nature should be. The type of visitor who wants treehouses also wants woodlands rich in bird life and animals. We lag behind other countries in treetop accommodation, but as a toehold of the creative and imaginative in what was until recently a vast collection of proto-pit props and telegraph poles, Keldy represents a huge leap forwards for the Forestry Commission.</p> <p>However, I still need something extra. Ranging off the path in Cropton, I wander through fairy rings of fly agaric mushrooms and into a shadowy dell of old beech. Leaving my bags behind, I climb a tree and sit on a high bough, the ground below lost in the leaves, a charm of goldfinches rolling past, the horizon nothing but treetops. Now, I muse, all I need is to drag a few bits of timber up, and some rope, then I can get started. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Forest Holidays (0845 1308223, <a href=\"http://www.forestholidays.co.uk\">forestholidays.co.uk</a>) offers a week's self-catering at Keldy in a cabin with treehouse (together sleeping eight people) in October, from \u00a3659.

  "<p>The French power group EDF will next week seal an agreed \u00a312.4bn takeover of the UK's main nuclear operator, British Energy, sources confirmed yesterday.</p> <p>The deal brings to an end months of government-sponsored talks that repeatedly broke down and is expected to be signed off by the EDF board over the weekend or early next week. It has the blessing of ministers.</p> <p>The state-controlled EDF is understood to have raised the cash offer it made in July of 765p a share by 9p to 774p and to have won over bigger investors that had opposed the initial bid.</p> <p>Shares in British Energy were trading at about 711p yesterday, well off their year's high of 785p, suggesting lingering doubts about the final outcome of the planned French acquisition.</p> <p>EDF is offering an alternative of 700p in cash and so-called contingent value rights, which enable investors to share in any enhanced profits when both power output and prices rise.</p> <p>Industry sources said that with oil and commodity prices falling, Invesco - British Energy's biggest private shareholder - had been persuaded to lift its opposition to a deal and vote in favour.</p> <p>The investment fund M&amp;G, which owns 6% of the nuclear operator, favoured a merger with Centrica, owner of British Gas, and early this month rejected suggestions that it had reached a deal with EDF. But it may now have been persuaded to accept the latest French offer, which has been partly brokered by ministers keen to see EDF use its long-standing expertise in spearheading the planned nuclear renaissance in Britain. </p> <p>The government owns 35.8% of British Energy and will make more than \u00a34bn when the deal goes through. It is calculated that with government and Invesco support, there will be majority support among investors, allowing it to go through.</p> <p>The business secretary John Hutton said this week that new nuclear power plants were essential for keeping the lights on, increasing security of supply, ending dependence on foreign imports and fighting climate change. Pledging \"maximum support\" for new-build reactors, Hutton said private-sector investment could total \u00a320bn and help create 100,000 jobs. But he warned of stiff competition from overseas as the world plans to build 400 new nuclear plants over the coming decades.</p> <p>Next week's deal will hand greater control over Britain's energy landscape to French state-owned groups since Areva, the plant-manufacturer and designer, is expected to win several of the likely contracts to build new reactors on British Energy's existing sites.</p> <p>The two French groups are already involved in building France's first new EPR (European Pressurised Reactor) plant at Flamanville on the Normandy coast, with the Sarkozy government planning a second.</p> <p>Last month Areva admitted, however, that it had incurred further losses running up to possibly hundreds of millions of euros through cost overruns at the EPR plant being built in Finland. The Finnish reactor, initially estimated to cost \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.4bn), may now cost 50% more.</p> <p>Industry sources suggested that the EDF/British Energy deal could be completed by the end of this year if the European commission approves it after a short, so-called Phase One competition investigation. A longer inquiry would delay the process by up to five months.</p> <p>British Energy owns eight nuclear power plants, producing 9,000 megawatts of electricity, or a sixth of Britain's needs, but these reactors are due to be phased out by just after 2020. It also owns a 2,000MW coal-fired station.</p> <p>EDF, which is 85%-owned by the French government, already has just under eight million gas and electricity customers in Britain, where it employs 12,000 people.</p> <p>It has been in protracted on-off talks with Centrica about the British group's participation in the deal, either as an eventual equity partner or as a buyer of British Energy's output. Centrica, Britain's biggest energy supplier, can produce only 40% of the power it needs.</p>",
  "<p>Not so very long ago, the US media and public loved Sergio Garc\u00eda, the emotional hub around which European Ryder Cup sides have revolved since his debut in 1999. That same year, the then teenaged Spaniard charmed the American nation by hitting a shot from behind a tree with his eyes shut, before running, skipping and jumping his way up Medinah's 16th fairway en route to finishing second behind Tiger Woods in the US PGA Championship. It was, for one so young, a wondrous display of fl air, imagination and nerve.</p> <p>Things change though, quickly in Garc\u00eda's case. Only one month after endearing himself to Uncle Sam's nieces and nephews, the former amateur champion plummeted to public enemy No2 (behind the disgracefully abused Colin Montgomerie) during the Ryder Cup in Boston. Suddenly Sergio's boisterous and boyish enthusiasm wasn't viewed as quite so charming. More than one member of the US side was moved to complain that his loud and uninhibited celebration of good shots or putts holed was both over the top and a little obnoxious.</p> <p>In that respect, nothing has changed in the nine years that have passed between the 33rd and 37th Ryder Cups. The biennial matches, in which Garc\u00eda is making his fifth straight appearance here at Valhalla, has remained the catalyst in the gradually deteriorating relationship between the winner of golf's most lucrative tournament \u2014 the Players' Championship \u2014 and golf American-style. Perhaps naively, Garc\u00eda has never bothered to disguise neither the delight nor the big cheesy grin he reserves for victorious Ryder Cup press conferences.</p> <p>Still, with Europe winless and down by three points to one after the morning foursomes \u2014 Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood stole a half by winning the last two holes against Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry \u2014 thoughts of a fourth successive European triumph were wilting by the time the Spaniard teed off after lunch alongside his compatriot, Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez. It was, however, no surprise to see Garc\u00eda back on the golf course \u2014 not once in his four previous Ryder Cups has he sat out a match. </p> <p>\"Sergio is one of only three players in the world who is technically excellent,\" says coach Pete Cowen, an apparently stern judge of golf ers who works with another member of this European side, Sweden's Henrik Stenson. \"Such is the quality of his full swing, even his bad shots are pretty good. He's a fantastic player and a fantastic talent.\"</p> <p>Watched by a six-strong group of matadors from, of all places, Manchester, the Iberian pair got off to just about the worst possible start against Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan, who had seen off the powerful pairing of Paul Casey and Stenson before lunch. Amazingly, that 3 &amp; 2 win represented Leonard's fi rst-ever win in nine Ryder Cup matches.</p> <p>Playing well, of course, is no guarantee of success at this level. Two-under par after five holes, Garc\u00eda and Jimenez were nevertheless two down, the Americans having birdied each of the first four. Garcia's only contribution at that stage was a three at the par-four 4th, the rest of his play marked by tentative putting. If the 28-year-old has a weakness it is on the greens. Not for nothing was he on the practice green a full 50 minutes before teeing off in his morning match, hitting a series of four-foot putts.</p> <p>\"It sometimes looks as if Sergio has a rhythm problem,\" contends Rick Smith, Phil Mickelson's former coach. \"Inside a certain range, his stroke gets shorter and quicker. Which is why he seems more comfortable over a 15-foot putt than one of six feet. His lack of rhythm can lead to inconsistency at impact and so the ball doesn't always roll smoothly.\"</p> <p>Back to two-down after yet another American birdie at the par-four 9th \u2014 Mahan holed from maybe 20 feet \u2014 the Spaniards could only shake their heads in awe at the quality of the golf emanating from their opponents. Even in fourballs, where shooting low scores has always been a prerequisite of success, four under par and two holes to the bad represented grounds for some degree of wonder .</p> <p>As expected, both sides made birdies at the long 10th, before Jimenez holed from 25 feet at the par-three 11th to haul the Europeans back into contention. It was a short-lived boost, however. Despite Garc\u00eda making a stout 15-foot putt for par at the 12th, Leonard holed from ten feet or so to restore the Americans' two-hole advantage.</p> <p>It was, as things turned out, the crucial thrust, or the beginning of the end. Another birdie from Mahan at Valhalla's signature hole, the short par-four 13th took the gap to three holes with only fi ve to play. Three holes later it was all over, Leonard finishing the match by chipping in for one last birdie at the 15th.</p> <h2>Ryder Cup record</h2> <p><strong>P21 W14 H3 L4 Pts15\u00bd</strong></p> <p>Foursomes P9 W8 H1 L0 Pts8</p> <p>Fourballs P8 W5 H2 L1 Pts6</p> <p>Singles P4 W1 H0 L3 Pts1</p> <p><strong>1999 P5 W3 H1 L1</strong></p> <p>Garc\u00eda, 19, and Jesper Parnevik are unbeaten through the opening two days.

  "<h2>Should I be using my debit card or am I better off with a credit card? Can I cover myself against airlines going bust and Eurotunnel fires?</h2> <p>With businesses going down quicker than a Trident submarine, there's never been a more sensible time to use a credit, rather than a debit, card when buying items costing more than \u00a3100. </p> <p>Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 means your credit card company is jointly liable, along with the retailer or trader, if something goes wrong with goods or services you paid for costing between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. In short, if the firm goes under, the credit card company has to pay you back. The protection applies to credit card purchases made from companies or websites situated overseas, but cash withdrawals are not covered. Nor are credit card cheques. </p> <p>You can even claim if you put less than \u00a3100 on your credit card, as long as the goods or services you paid for actually cost more. Check out the case of David Marsh. </p> <p>Barclaycard reimbursed him the \u00a315,326 he thought he had lost after a web-based car dealer went bust prior to delivering his Toyota Prius.</p> <p>He agreed to pay Newcardiscount.com \u00a316,326 for the Prius, putting down a \u00a31,000 deposit on Barclaycard. He paid the balance by electronic transfer from his bank account. </p> <p>But the car was never delivered, and it emerged Newcardiscount had gone into administration. \"I thought we had lost our money but the administrator suggested we apply to Barclaycard - despite the fact that we had only paid the deposit by card. \"</p> <p>Marsh says the refund process was rather torturous - there were a huge number of forms. After a long wait, Barclaycard this week reimbursed all the money. </p> <p>\"I'm still not entirely clear how it works, but I'm mighty glad it does. I'll definitely be paying for everything with my credit card in future,\" he says.</p> <h2>I only have a debit card. Am I still covered? </h2> <p>Although debit cards are not covered by Section 75, you do have some protection. All Visa debit and credit cards are covered by its chargeback rules, so you can claim your money back for the same reasons as Section 75, for example, if goods aren't delivered or aren't as they were described. </p> <p>Visa Europe said: \"Visa chargeback regulations allow banks to recover money paid on all Visa debit, credit and prepaid cards from the retailer's bank, if goods or services are not delivered or are not as specified.\"</p> <p>Visa chargeback claims must be made within 120 days of the purchase or from the date the goods or services were due to be delivered. </p> <h2>So which credit card should I use when I head off to Bluewater?</h2> <p>The hot credit card at the moment is the American Express Platinum Moneyback card, which pays new cardholders 5% cashback, on up to \u00a34,000 spending during the first three months. Once this intro offer expires, its rates are tiered, paying a maximum 1.5% cashback. For spending up to \u00a320,000 the next best is the Egg Money card (not the standard Egg card). It pays 1% cashback on everything you buy, though the pay-out is capped at \u00a3200 a year. If you buy a lot of petrol, the Citi-Shell credit card is offering a 6p per litre discount using its cards in Shell garages for 60 days and then 3p per litre after that. You get 1% cashback on all other purchases.</p> <h2>If I use a credit card won't I get hit by nasty interest charges?</h2> <p>Not if you're smart. Lots of people now use their credit cards to buy everything, paying it off at the end of each month with a standing order that automatically debits their bank account. Assuming you've got the money, you'll incur no interest charges.</p> <h2>Is there any time when I shouldn't use a credit card?</h2> <p>With some of the so-called low-cost carriers applying absurdly high charges to anyone paying with a credit card, this is a case for using a debit card, and buying extra travel insurance to cover the failure of the airline for \u00a38 a year.</p> <h2>How do I go about getting my money back? </h2> <p>To make a credit card claim using Section 75, you can download an example template letter and get more detailed advice and guidance from <a href=\"http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk\">consumerdirect.gov.uk</a> and 0845 404 0506.</p> <h2>Does the credit crunch mean there are bargains to be snapped up?</h2> <p>Look no further than new and used cars. The car trade is currently slower than a Robin Reliant with a flat tyre and dealers are taking silly offers just to keep the bank manager off their backs. Only super-minis are selling - big cars and 4x4s are at the lowest prices for years. Porsche sales during August were down more than 50%. If you've always longed for one, you may not get a better chance. Try <a href=\"http://www.cargiant.co.uk\">cargiant.co.uk</a> for used car deals and <a href=\"http://www.honestjohn.co.uk\">honestjohn.co.uk</a> for a list of cheapest deals on new cars. </p> <h2>What other bargains are out there?</h2> <p>With the property market in the doldrums, retailers who rely on house sales to bring people through the doors are prepared to do more than most for a sale. Furniture, carpets kitchens, bathrooms, even big TVs are all in a buyer's market. Shop around, haggle hard, and be prepared to walk away. And only pay with a credit card. </p> <h2>Should I be rushing to Aldi?</h2> <p>It's no surprise that local newspapers are full of ads showing how a family of four can eat for \u00a38. All the supermarkets have been forced to react to the so-called Aldi effect - the rise of the discount supermarket - by appearing to reduce prices. In truth, food prices in the UK soared 10% in the year to August as retailers pass on rising commodity costs. Expect to see plenty more fake discounting.</p> <h2>I'm already living on lentils, what else can I do?</h2> <p>If you're on your fourth bowl of dahl of the week, you've probably been through your personal finances with a fine-tooth comb. If you haven't, do it now. Plenty of households can save up to \u00a31,000 a year by cutting out waste. Switching car and home insurer can easily save \u00a3400. After that, switch to a cheaper broadband supplier, ditch the paid-for TV service, or that unused gym membership. Go through your monthly spend and you'll be amazed what you can cut. </p> <h2>I've just been made redundant. Where can I get a cheap suit?</h2> <p>Hot on the heels of the Asda's \"court appearance\" suit, Aldi has launched the \"credit crunch\" whistle. Its pinstripe business suit costs \u00a324.98 - trousers cost \u00a37.99 and jacket \u00a316.99. Aldi says it is washable, durable and unlike most cheap suits it is not 100% polyester.</p>",
  "<p>My father died, aged 73, in 1994. The last thought in my mind, back then, was that I would ever want to write about him. Talking about him was another matter: the patience of my friends was tested to the limits by stories of the man who had always been - who, devastatingly, still is - the most powerful presence in my life. </p> <p>I thought about him, I dreamed about him, I struggled - having inherited the sizable country house the survival of which he had dedicated himself to with energy and passion - to carry on his task. I did not, however, want to write a book about him.</p> <p>I had two reasons to be reluctant. One was that while the opening years of my father's life, given his generation and his background, seemed conventional - loveless boy forms a passion for his childless uncle's old-fashioned house and sacrifices everything to obtaining and defending it - the later decades exposed a different man. </p> <p>In his 50s, my father reinvented himself as a high-speed motorbike rider. Jaguars and sporty MGs gave way, after this mid-life epiphany, to Laverdas, Nortons and Ducatis. A lack of technical skill, coupled with a strong dislike of solitude, sent him searching for pillion riders. In Robbie, a burly teenager from south London, my father found the ideal companion - and the love of his life. Robbie became part of a menage a trois in which my mother, who made no comment on her altered circumstances, became cook and housekeeper to two leather-clad tearabouts. The situation was maintained until 1993 when, just before Christmas, Robbie, aged 33, blew his brains out with my father's shotgun. My father, broken in spirit by the sudden loss of his friend, died of pancreatic cancer just five months after Robbie's suicide.</p> <p>The obvious reason not to write anything down, then, was that I would be betraying the family code of honour, by which disturbing secrets can be whispered - and even spread - but never set down in print. (\"There are so many versions of how things were,\" my brother commented, when I first mooted the possibility of writing what became In My Father's House. \"But the published version is all that will be believed. And what on Earth would you do about our mother?\") </p> <p>What indeed? My brother had identified the more powerful argument for silence. Our mother still lived with me in our family house. She had no plans to leave; I felt no wish for her to depart. How, given this situation, could I even consider publishing intimate revelations about my family? The plans for a memoir were shelved.</p> <p>In 2003, following 14 years of marriage, my husband left me. Back at the big house, alone with my mother, I shrank from discussing my failed marriage, or my dread of a lonely future. She, however, was ready at last to speak about her complicated relationship with my father. Carefully, we began to talk.</p> <p>Sitting down to supper with her, just the two of us, night after night, I began to understand how well she had kept things from me. Struck by the quiet acuteness of her observations, I winced at my own failure to defend her from hurt. (The easy option had always been to take my father's side as he mocked and criticised his wife - her hair, her clothes, her manner, even.) Too busy pitying myself, as back then I was subjected to the same unforgiving treatment, I had given no thought to her sufferings. Now, sitting up late over our cosy kitchen suppers, I realised how little I had ever known my mother - and how much she could tell me.</p> <p>It's a strange thing to write about other people for a profession (I've published four biographies) and then to discover you understand nothing about your own closest kin. The woman who became my chief companion for the next three years before I married again in 2006 was, as I gradually discerned, a stranger to me. My father, an unusually dominant personality, had always stood at the centre of our family circle. Volatile, witty and imperious, he called the tune to which his minions danced. I, who inherited his own hot temper, stepped out of line from time to time, flew at him, shouted back, made my anger known. My mother, from the earliest years of her married life, adopted the opposite tactic. Silence and retreat were the stratagems she chose for her survival. When voices rose, she looked away. When pressure built, she wandered out into the garden.</p> <p>\"I was weak,\" my mother said during one of our long discussions. I disagreed. Finally aware of how much unhappiness she had endured, how much it had cost her to pretend that all was well, I admired her dignity, her old-fashioned decency. I told her - and meant it - that she had been both loyal and brave.</p> <p>It was at that point I knew I had found my story's heroine - and a voice for my own conscience. The only way to justify the act of betrayal I was about to make was to give my mother a platform in the memoir from which to speak out against me, her daughter.</p> <p>There were moments of sharp regret in our three years of retrospective discussions. (Why had I always chosen to take my father's side against her?) But there were also moments of sweet compensation. As we both recalled, my father had deplored his wife's lack of humour. Disinterring the letters my mother had written my father during their engagement, I was enchanted to discover a young woman whose capacity for banter and mirth shone out of the yellowing pages. I read them back to her; across the kitchen table, I watched her face.</p> <p>\"Did I say that?\" Her cheeks glowed pink as a girl's. \"Did I really? Good grief! How did I dare?\"</p> <p>The conversations were both engrossing and chastening. We spoke, for the first time, as equals; forgetting she was my mother I rediscovered her as my friend. However, our new intimacy was not close enough for me to trust her with the text of my unfinished book. Fearful of her reaction, I hid it from view. I kept to myself the fact that its writing had conjured back into life all the unhappiness of the past. </p> <p>\"I keep dreaming about him,\" my mother announced on regular occasions. \"He always looks so angry. I don't know why.\"</p> <p>She dreamed, and my nightmares echoed hers. I saw my father glaring through my window while I lay in bed. I watched his fists try to break through the glazed surface of the garden lake, where Robbie used to fish, while the figure of my father stretched out at his side. I saw him seated at the head of the family table, back in control, back for ever more. A bad conscience - my own - was evidently at work. It couldn't be helped. The book was almost completed.</p> <p>On the day I handed my mother the published volume, she asked for time to read it alone, without interruption. She took it into her room and closed the door. The following morning, she told me I'd made mistakes. Sick with dismay, I asked her to identify the errors. </p> <p>\"First of all,\" she announced, her face severe, \"I never had freckles. And I don't know what made you say my nail varnish is always chipped. Look!\"</p> <p>The hand she held out presented five bright-pink moons and not a chip in sight.</p> <p>Later, my mother admitted to my husband that she had needed a double whisky to help her through that first reading. She made no such confession to me; loyalty, as always, triumphed. I had no inkling, back then, of her real feelings. I still don't. She says, kindly, what she senses I most want to hear.</p> <p>Yet late in widowhood my mother has recovered the zest of an earlier, more vibrant self. My father's subdued consort of former years would not recognise herself in the outspoken and unpredictable old lady of today: colourful in costume, dazzling in footwear, it delights her to see the effect she can achieve through tendering subversive remarks. Nowadays, my mother follows the career of Johnny Depp with eager interest and examines the pages of Heat and Grazia with a keen eye for a muscular torso. Yesterday, she mentioned her wish to winter in Marrakech. When a London mugger tried to snatch her bag, my mother swung out and sent him flying. Back at the house, we cheered.</p> <p>I can't tell how much this upsurge of spirit has to do with the laying of ghosts, but my mother declares that the book has proved cathartic. My father, on the rare occasions that he still visits her dreams, wears an approving smile. She has ceased to question what he would say about our having transformed his venerated home into a venue for weddings and corporate events. My friends say she looks younger and happier than she has for years.</p> <p>I thought, when I began to write this most difficult of my books, that it would act for me, too, as a form of exorcism. I was wrong. How could I hope living in this house - over which my father presided for almost 50 years - that a mere book could banish him? \"God send I never have to leave for ever,\" he wrote when he was 21. He's here, still. My mother's nights have grown quiet. My own dreams are worse than before. I see beds threatened by fire, sheets laden with ancient sea-rocks, the garden lake surrounded by small, watchful figures, keeping vigil. All these fragments originate in and issue from the pages of my own published account of our troubled home. That knowledge doesn't help.</p> <p>\"It's not so bad as you think,\" a Jungian therapist reassures me when, learning of her profession, I admit to despair. Soothing me, she interprets the images of my dreams. A lake represents the subconscious; the smouldering bed is not sinister, since no blaze breaks out; the watchful figures at the water's edge are attendant aspects of myself, not evil strangers. I'm less comforted when she warns me to expect no moment of closure, no blissful catharsis.</p> <p>I do (on that point) believe her. Writing and talking about past experiences has brought my mother and I much closer. Old and painful memories of our former life, however, cannot be entirely effaced. Not while, as sharers in the profound attachment that he felt for the place, the two of us continue to reside within the deceptively mellow brick walls of my father's house.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In My Father's House: Elegy for an Obsessive Love by Miranda Seymour is published by Simon &amp; Schuster, priced \u00a37.99.

  "<h2>Left out in the cold by Saga</h2> <p>Our family collected to send my elderly parents to Canada to see relatives, flying in October. We booked with Zoom. </p> <p>The credit card will repay as Zoom is bust, but they don't want to rebook until next April as it's a very cold part of Canada to visit! </p> <p>They bought Saga travel insurance in February, to cover the trip - it cost \u00a3760 due to their poor health. </p> <p>They wanted to move the Saga policy to next April but Saga says they missed the 14-day cancellation period, and they cannot extend the policy beyond the end of February. This would mean them paying again.<br><strong>EH, Leeds</strong></p> <p>It took your mother three hours on the phone to find out that Saga would not allow her and your father to extend their insurance - despite not making a single claim. This left her in a distressed state.</p> <p>With airlines and travel companies failing, this problem has become more general. The Association of British Insurers says that policy providers often allow dates to be changed if no claim has been made, but can charge extra if the destination is different - the United States is more expensive than France, for instance - and they can deduct for the additional risk of cancellation as the period is greater.</p> <p>Direct Line says it allows like-for-like changes without charges - as does the Post Office. But this is not automatic - you have to ask.</p> <p>Saga says it follows this general rule and would normally have allowed the policy to apply to a different date.</p> <p>It said no to your parents as they wanted to fly more than one year after the policy started. But it now says if the policy can no longer be used due to unforeseen circumstances, such as airline failure, beyond the customer's control, it will take a sympathetic view. In your case, it has decided to refund the \u00a3760 so your parents can either take out another policy or, if they are unable to travel due to poor health, bank the money.</p> <h2>When Diamond cuts up rough</h2> <p>In August you wrote of a Diamond car policyholder chased for past premiums because she failed to declare speeding tickets. I am going through the same issue with Diamond with one big difference - I told them about my fines but it took no notice. Diamond asked for \u00a3395 in past premiums only when I reminded it. Is this fair?<br><strong>GW, London </strong></p> <p>You may be interested to know that a top insurance lawyer says there is no legal right to demand payments for a contract which has ended.</p> <p>In your case, you told the insurer, whereas the previous complainant admits she did not. Your policy started in late 2004, and you were caught in August 2005 when you told Diamond. But you could have no knowledge of Diamond's system. So you did not mention it at renewal as you knew your offence was already in its files. Diamond concedes it did not keep records of calls from August 2005, relying instead on those at renewal.</p> <p>It says it first became aware of the offence in March 2008 when you altered the policy. It then promised to review past calls but failed to do so. It admits handling the policy poorly and will now waive its \u00a3395 demand. You have since moved your cover elsewhere, paying less despite the offence.</p> <h2>Come on Redcats, get it out of your system</h2> <p>As a customer of clothing catalogue La Redoute, despite sometimes erratic service, I received a letter from it on August 28 promising giveaway iPods (worth \u00a3159 each). To win, I had to call an expensive 0844 number, place an order of any value and be among the first 150. I did this and was told I was a winner. I was delighted!</p> <p>But a few days later, La Redoute sent an undated letter saying I had not won as I applied one day too soon. I am outraged. Am I alone?<br><strong>AP, Hertfordshire </strong></p> <p>No. There are many others told they had won who are equally disappointed - the \u00a310 discount from a future order you were offered is no substitute. </p> <p>The mailshot said: \"We've got 150 iPod Classics to give away. This season we are giving away 150 iPod Classics to our fastest customers to order. So be quick, call our friendly team!\" It even promised \"an extra special surprise\" if you were one of the first 150. Despite this, the date entries should start was buried in small print condition five.</p> <p>La Redoute wrote: \"Due to an internal problem our system processed some orders which were not eligible and customers may not have been made aware of this at the time of ordering.\" This \"system error\", at a mail order company dependent on its computer system, also sent letters to non-winners telling them when their iPod would arrive. \"Please ignore this,\" wrote La Redoute. This is not behaviour to increase confidence in the firm, part of Redcats, which calls itself \"the international leader, multibrands, multichannel, in fashion and home furnishing\".</p> <p>When Capital Letters called, Redcats admitted its mistake, saying it will now send you and others a \u00a350 credit and a \u00a350 voucher against a future order.</p> <p>This is hardly the same as an iPod - nor could Redcats explain the difference between the two methods of \"compensation\". </p> <h2>We want to call time on our timeshare</h2> <p>We have subscribed to timeshare swap organisation Resorts Condominium International (RCI) since 1989 so we could exchange our Tenerife week with time elsewhere. But due to our age (we are in our 80s) and health (which is not great), we can no longer use the timeshare so we have no use for RCI. I wrote to RCI in May to end the membership, due to renew in July. But I heard nothing. </p> <p>In early August, RCI phoned to say we had to give 12 months notice to terminate the agreement. Later that month RCI wrote to demand \u00a3109 - \u00a379 membership plus a \u00a330 charge for late payment. This was backed by a threat of debt collectors and \"legal proceedings\". Please help.<br><strong>WP, Berkshire</strong></p> <p>You have accepted that your timeshare is now effectively worthless - you can't sell it and have no further use for it. So you don't need RCI either.</p> <p>Capital Letters pointed out to RCI that its current contract on its website made no mention of a 12-month notice period, and asked it to produce a copy of your original contract (it did not).</p> <p>RCI argued that the surrender process takes 12 months in case you have any remaining swaps in the system. </p> <p>But it now accepts that you have abandoned timeshare completely. It will call off the debt and the threats.</p> <h2>Sorry, we make mistakes as well</h2> <p>I bought a subscription to Guardian Weekly in mid-June for my sister who lives in California. It was meant as her birthday present. I paid \u00a399 on my credit card and was told I would receive confirmation shortly.</p> <p>A month later, I received two copies of Guardian Weekly at home and had \u00a377 debited from my card. I phoned again to complain. But now, three months after her birthday, she has still not had a single issue. Please sort this. <br><strong>LS, Norfolk </strong></p> <p>This was a mix-up of addresses which has been put right. Your sister's subscription will be extended by three months to say sorry for the error, and your credit card should be debited for the correct amount.</p> <p><strong>Contact</strong> We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<h2>All at sea, as Eurostar left us without help</h2> <p>After getting back - from a somewhat more prolonged journey home than I had anticipated - from the Croatia v England match, I noticed that Saturday's Guardian said nothing about how unhelpful Eurostar has been to its customers over the recent delays. </p> <p>I arrived in Brussels on Friday morning to find that I, and everybody else, had only two options. Either wait until \"four or five\" when they \"might\" have more information, or get back under our own steam and get the ticket cost refunded. No help with the cost of alternative transport. No token free refreshments. Not even information about train or ferry services. Only misleading information about where we could find other transport. </p> <p>When will we start fighting for greater and more immediate compensation from railway companies and airlines who do not deliver what hard-working people have paid for?</p> <p>The return trip was not all bad news. When I took the ferry to Dover as a foot passenger I realised a, how cheap it was and b, that I'd forgotten ferry travel could be quite pleasant. I will certainly give the ferry a serious look next time. </p> <p>Hopefully, Eurostar will suffer in its pocket and realise it has to start treating customers better.<br><strong>Paul Woodgate</strong>, Acton, London</p> <h2>Why do banks take us to account over data loss?</h2> <p>In the wake of data loss by Royal Bank of Scotland et al, my bank has suggested I buy insurance against identity theft. This is a curious inversion of the normal situation, where most businesses, trades and professions carry their own insurance to cover customers in the event of cock-ups. Don't banks do this? And if not, why not?<br><strong>Julia Bayes</strong>, via email</p> <h2>Council tax argument </h2> <p>I can't accommodate I was surprised no one has answered in Your Shout (Sept 13) the assertion that council tax helps to provide more available accommodation. It is death and the care home that \"frees up\" accommodation. Council tax merely accelerates this process, mainly by induced malnutrition and hypothermia. <br><strong>David Gumbrell</strong>, via email</p> <h2>Point of no return over Pisa traffic fines</h2> <p>I run a blog called <a href=\"http://www.blogfromitaly.com\">blogfromitaly.com</a> and one of the many things I hear about is speeding and other fines received in Italy. I wrote a post about this in September 2006 and have received more than 250 comments from foreign motorists who have been fined, more often than not, for entering the Pisa limited/restricted traffic circulation zone.</p> <p>Many of the comments express a sense of outrage, as those who have received these fines never appear to have seen the signs that warn they are about to enter one of these areas. The other problem is that disputing such fines is just about impossible as the Pisa authorities state any documents must be submitted in Italian. </p> <p>This does not appear to be all that fair seeing as the fine notifications are sent out in (bad) English. Many of those who have been fined are talking about never returning to Italy and accuse the Pisa authorities of running a honey trap. I am also exploring the line that requiring foreigners to contest these fines in Italian, goes against the Italian constitution. </p> <p>Here is an extract from it which I believe may be relevant. Article 24 says: \"Everyone may bring cases before a court of law in order to protect their rights under civil and administrative law.\" The key word is \"everyone\". This may imply that anyone and everyone, regardless of nationality, may bring cases in an Italian court of law, which means that, theoretically, cases could be fought in English - especially in view of Italy's membership of the EC. </p> <p>If this is the case, then it may be argued that the Pisa authorities' notifications are invalid.<br><strong>Alex Roe</strong>, Milan</p> <h2>More bureaucracy ... that's not obsolete</h2> <p>Thanks for the instructive article on obsolete accounts (Money, Sept 13). For several years I had an online saver with Lloyds TSB and even received a nice letter last November telling me I was being given a bonus of half a per cent for a full year (5.15%). </p> <p>Soon after, rates fell and the internet saver account was introduced. A few months later, there was quite a margin between the rates of the old and the new account. I've since removed a substantial amount of money from the account, but now that we're told not to keep more than \u00a335,000 in one account, that's a lot of bureaucracy.<br><strong>Christoph Assheuer</strong>, Berlin </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Write to</strong> Money, 119 Farringdon Road, London, EC1R 3ER.

  "<p>It's a man's world here in Kentucky. A point made evident yet again during Nick Faldo's extraordinary speech during the opening ceremony at Valhalla. In a performance reminiscent of Michael Barrymore at awards ceremonies in the early 90s the European captain behaved, in a word, erratically. His introduction of the wives and girlfriends was perfunctory as he briskly announced, \"a Caroline, a Jocelyn, an Anne, a Lauren and a Laurae, an Emma and an Ebba, and a Montserrat\". His introduction of his men, however, bordered on the lascivious. He talked about Paul Casey's Popeye muscles and described him as a Robbie Williams lookalike (this intended as a compliment). He told the world that Graeme McDowell was single and available from Monday. He virtually said: \"if you want Swedes I've got Swedes\". It wasn't Pimp My Ride, it was Pimp My Side.</p> <p>Anyway, I hadn't gone to all the trouble of fighting my way through the crowds to get to the box seats in order to listen to Faldo. I was there to check out the American Golf wives. This being a weakness I developed in Brooklyn in 1999. It had been a strange trip. On the first night, I had nearly been run over by a drunk in a motorised wheelchair careering across the pavement (Stephen Hawking was staying in my hotel). On the last night, after a long semantic argument with ever more senior level of management over the meaning of the word intoxicated I had been thrown out of the Fairmont. </p> <p>In between, I had fallen for Mrs Hal Sutton IV, hard. An infatuation which led me to watch more of Hal Sutton's golf than was healthy and, in less liberal countries, might have seen me fending off stalking charges. I'm still unsure as to my motivation. Was it the fourth bit or the suspicion that golfer's wives are more bored than most? How often can you pick up the phone to hear, 'Hi babe, at one I hit five iron to eight foot made the putt. At two, driver, seven iron, two putts. At three ...' without craving some excitement?</p> <p>On my return, at the height of the dotcom madness, I spoke with my accountant about the idea of raising seed money for golferswives.com, and having discovered that this domain had gone, golfershotwives.com. Before we could clean up, the market crashed.</p> <p>All this came back to me as I surveyed the American wives. The Europeans were off limits. I want the Europeans to win, and for one of them to live in fear of being cuckolded while enduring a foursome with Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahon might damage morale (not everyone, least of all golfers, possess the sensibilities of Howard Jacobson's Felix Quinn). Furthermore, Golf Wives, my accountant and I agreed, like Desperate Housewives is an American thing. It works better in Norfolk, Virginia, than Norfolk, East Anglia.</p> <p>One wife stood out. The strikingly leggy Mrs Cink who, helpfully for identification purposes, was raven-haired in a sea of blondes. Yesterday morning, pretending to be interested in Rose and Poulter, I went in search of her. And yet of Mrs Cink there was no sign. This was disappointing. If the website had been up and running I might have consoled myself with how many hits \"A Lie-In for Mrs Cink\" might have engendered or, more libidinously and, perhaps, libellously, \"A Lie-In with Mrs Cink\". But it wasn't.</p> <p>Further disappointment followed when Mark Pougatch, a leading authority on American Golf Wives and likely to be offered a lucrative contract to helm Watch with Pougatch just as soon as the website is up and running, informed me that I had just missed Lisa. Lisa, it transpired, being Mrs Cink.</p> <p>What to do? I could switch wives but I have always been a regular one world, one dream, one golf hot wife kinda guy. And what to wish for? If Europe won it would aid the cause but if they did so Cink might not play again until Sunday and nor, by extension, would his wife. Call me a pervert if you will, and I now realise, albeit belatedly, this piece might aid such a claim, but I was conflicted. Europe or Mrs Cink? You decide.</p> <p>In the event, Cink won and, staggeringly, was not selected. You lose some, you lose some more.</p>",
  "<p>England's Michael Adams and Nigel Short shared second prize behind Holland's Jan Werle at this week's European Union championship in Liverpool, but they reached it by very different routes. </p> <p>Top seeded Adams, ranked in the world top dozen, went through the 10 rounds unbeaten and was rarely in danger, though with five draws he could have pushed harder. Short's tournament was defined by an early-round disaster when his mobile phone rang during play. The world body Fide's stance is that a ring equals a zero. Short's Nokia Gambit was unlucky since he turned off his mobile at the start of the game, not realising that the switched off phone could still ring to warn of a low battery. This defeat rocked Short, but he recovered to finish strongly with the final-round game below. Black would be fine with the obvious Nxf4 at move 15 or 16, but the Lithuanian relied too much on the shallow trap Bc5 expecting 19 Qxc6 Rxb5 20 Qxb5 Qg4+ with a draw by perpetual check. Short's 21 Bf5 (even better 21 Bd1 trapping the h5 knight) won rook for bishop and Black respectfully resigned.</p> <p>The Liverpool event was one of the strongest ever in the UK.

  "<p>The basic identities of America's two political parties have been in place for at least 40 years and, on core economic questions, for 70, since Franklin Roosevelt's time. Whatever so-called \"low-information voters\" do or don't know about politics, they know that the Democrats are the party of working people, and the Republicans are the party of the rich.</p> <p>It doesn't end up being as positive for the Democrats as that formulation makes it sound. Since the 1980s, Republicans have been successful in shifting public opinion among America's middle-class more towards the view that their economic fate is tied up with rich people's. In addition, a weak union movement - just one in 14 private-sector workers is a union member today - means that class consciousness exists only on the margins.</p> <p>But these basic identities do still mean that, when a scandal breaks out involving oblivious gluttony on the part of elements within the financial over-class, Americans will place more blame on the GOP, and the Democrats will benefit. Especially when it happened on the watch of a Republican administration that is deeply unpopular.</p> <p>So, it made sense that the initial phase of public reaction to the past week's Wall Street scandal would have worked to the political benefit of Barack Obama. The Democratic nominee would have benefited no matter who it was - Obama, Hillary Clinton, Dennis Kucinich, my cat for that matter. A week ago today, John McCain had a small lead in the polls. Now, Obama does. The numbers are back to being essentially where they were before the conventions, with Obama sitting on a wobbly margin of three or so points.</p> <p>McCain helped Obama's position with an initial response to last week's economic crisis that seemed to be delivered from a different planet. On Monday, with headlines blaring and the markets reeling, he insisted yet again - as he has several times in recent months - that the \"fundamentals\" of the economy were still \"strong\". No doubt that wasn't very reassuring to the average Ohioan or Michigander.</p> <p>McCain continued to flounder for most of the week. He employed ferociously populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric, attacking the \"greed\" and \"recklessness\" of the executives who netted, in many cases, eight-figure incomes while gambling away the mortgages of $40,000-a-year earners. But - those age-old identities again - it just wasn't persuasive coming from a multimillionaire Republican. His legislative record tilts strongly toward supporting deregulation and, over the past year, as he has kissed up to his party's rightwing, he has sought to downplay the portions of his record that did endorse regulation.</p> <p>Perhaps worst of all, he also proposed a commission to study the problem - at a moment when the Dow, before rallying later in the week, was losing about 900 points, or nearly 10% of its value.</p> <p>In the face of this, Obama could have spent the week windsurfing with John Kerry and still come out fairly well. What he did instead, along with his running mate Joe Biden, is turn his campaign sharply negative against McCain - important to note: not against Sarah Palin, but against John McCain - for being out of touch and merely the newest representative of a failed governing philosophy.</p> <p>\"I certainly don't fault Senator McCain for these problems,\" Obama said in his initial statement on Monday, \"but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to.\" He pressed the point much harder as the week went on.</p> <p>Biden, whether importantly or not remains to be seen, emerged from the relative shadows and gave incendiary speeches throughout the week, denouncing the Republican philosophy and McCain personally. He denounced the Bush tax cuts and McCain's new-found embrace of them, citing McCain's own description from long ago of Bush's decision to prosecute two wars while handing out immense tax cuts to the wealthy at the same time (\"immoral\" was the word McCain used).</p> <p>The Democrats were responding to a rising chorus of discontent within their own ranks - which probably reached a climax midweek sometime - that they were just standing around taking punches and letting McCain and Palin set the agenda completely.</p> <p>Nothing, and I mean nothing, sends American liberals to the cliff's edge, the whiskey bottle or the shrink's couch like the perception that their team isn't returning fire. The belief among liberals is widely held, and I suppose I hold it myself, that both Al Gore and Kerry would have won (Gore of course did win, but let's not get into that) if they'd understood that they were in a no-rules campaign and not a college debating match and behaved accordingly.</p> <p>The fetid aroma of passivity that began to emanate from Obama-Biden, particularly after the Palin coronation, had partisan Democrats screaming for their candidates to do something. And they did: a study came out earlier in the week showing that Obama's television advertising campaign had become markedly more negative than McCain's. </p> <p>And speaking of McCain's running mate, another effect of the crisis is that it seems to have ended, finally, the Palin-mania phase of the race. </p> <p>It's as if God watched the circus and read all the absurd and excessive coverage of pigs and lipstick and said, \"All right, I'm going to do something to make these people talk about the economy whether they want to or not.\"</p> <p>So, that was phase one of the political fallout of the Wall Street scandal. But yesterday marked the beginning of phase two.</p> <p>In this phase, the shouts and histrionics will abate somewhat. Each day gives McCain - and the Bush administration - opportunities to regain some purchase on events and appear in control. The administration and the Federal Reserve Bank were preparing a massive bailout yesterday (one in which the taxpayers would, in essence, buy billions of dollars in banks' bad loans). McCain gave an economic speech in the crucial state of Wisconsin, where he trails by a few points, denouncing Obama's plan to raise taxes on the middle class (a plan that does not exist, but that's never stopped McCain from saying it repeatedly).</p> <p>What was important politically in the first phase was demonstrating credible outrage at the fat-cats and empathy with the regular folks. In phase two, actual, clear-cut and persuasively packaged proposals will be more important. This is why McCain, in his speech, endorsed various forms of oversight he hadn't given much thought to before, and why Obama spent part of yesterday huddled with establishment seal-of-approval economic advisers such as Paul Volcker and Robert Rubin.</p> <p>Simply because he's a member of George Bush's political party, McCain has the bigger challenge over the next few days. With 81% of Americans believing the country is \"seriously\" on the wrong track, McCain has to explain why he'll be so different even though he's voted with Bush 90% of the time.</p> <p>Obama has always had more trouble with packaging. He has, if anything, too many policy proposals. He finds it hard to pare them down to three or four compelling points and present them in crisp, short sentences. In US presidential politics, the packaging is more important than the thinking. And next Friday brings the first of the three important presidential debates.</p> <p>This would be a good time for Obama to call in David Mamet to come look over his sentences. The election's outcome could possibly be decided between now and next Friday night. Obama can rely on those age-old perceptions of the two parties, but only if he also reinforces them.</p>",
  "<p>When looking for cheaper, good value bottles, people tend (rightly) to home in on Chile, Spain, the south-west of France and, for its fruity reliability, Australia. Increasingly, South Africa is attracting attention, too. The reasons aren't glamorous. While the euro has been so strong against the pound in recent months that the price of European wine sold here has had to go up to make good the shortfall in currency exchange, the rand has been relatively weak, giving South African winemakers a strong trading position. A short harvest in Australia after the drought of 2007 (when the yield was almost 30% lower than that of the previous year) also left an opportunity for others to elbow their bottles on to supermarket shelves. And, it seems, South Africa has been taking advantage. After a wretched 2006, when wine exports dipped, its (off-trade) sales are up 13%, according to AC Nielsen, and UK sales of its wines are growing at a faster rate than those of any other country.</p> <p>So where can you find the value? I much prefer South Africa's whites to its reds - though, naturally, there are exceptions.

South African sauvignon blanc can be magnificent, especially in the \u00a35-\u00a310 range, and really holds up in terms of sipping pleasure per pound against New Zealand and the Loire. South Africa is also producing some mouthwatering, burgundian-styled chardonnay (look for names such as Cape Chamonix and Hamilton Russell).

  "<p>Veal is a tricky subject, one that's apt to provoke fierce reactions. There's something about baby cattle that invokes a fiercely protective instinct in many people, and an epicurean sense of pleasure in, well, not so many, in Britain at any rate. I count myself among the latter. A whole shin of veal, with a bucket of sliced carrots, braised long in white wine and pink grapefruit juice until the meat falls from the bone in soft, succulent, sweet flavoured lumps, is a divine mouthful. Osso buco, too, I have a weakness for. And I dream of escalope de veau Holstein. However, I know these things are not to everyone's tastes. </p> <p>\"When I first started selling our veal in farmers' markets,\" Jon Brown told me over a cup of tea, \"some people would come up and harangue me. They wouldn't listen to anything I had to say. Some did, though, and are now among my best customers.\" We were in the kitchen of his cottage on one of the winding lanes around Looe in Cornwall, where he lives with his wife, Vicky, and two children. </p> <p>The Browns make unlikely veal farmers. They didn't start out to do anything of the sort: Vicky was an ambulance driver, Jon a jewellery wholesaler. In spite of, or perhaps because of, the delights of the city, the lure of rural life drew them down to Cornwall with the intention of starting a restaurant. Very wisely, they decided not to - there are few quicker ways of losing a lot of money than that - and opted instead to set up a farm shop. But that proved easier said than done.</p> <p>\"And then one day we were talking to Vicky's brother, Rob, who had resurrected the dairy herd on this, his parents' old farm. He told us how distressed he was having to kill all his bull calves at birth.\"</p> <p>Bull calves are one of the unavoidable by-products of the dairy industry. If we want milk, butter and cheese (not to mention yogurt, double cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and all those other wonderful dairy products), we need pregnant cows, because only cows with calves produce milk. And, inevitably, a certain number of those calves will turn out to be proto-bulls, and will remain so until we genetically engineer cows not to do so. The meat industry can absorb only so much beef, so only a certain number of bull calves are allowed to grow into bulls, bullocks or whatever. The rest, more than 250,000 a year, are slaughtered at birth. That is an unpalatable fact of British dairy farming life.</p> <p>It was too unpalatable for Jon and Vicky. Inspired by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage books, they decided to take on Rob's bull calves and turn them into something useful by giving them a longer life, even if that meant one of only six months in all. \"I'd barely seen a cow at the time,\" Jon said.</p> <p>They started with five calves, and now, just two years along the line, they're taking two a week to the abattoir near Bodmin, with the aim of getting up to four a week. They take all the calves Rob can provide, and have started taking them in from surrounding farms, too - Holstein/Friesians, with the odd Guernsey. They raise them in small groups in loose straw yards or, weather permitting, open fields. They supply a dozen restaurants in the area, including Nathan Outlaw in Fowey and Fifteen in Watergate Bay, but the farmers' markets in Exeter and Truro constitute the major business.</p> <p>Clearly, small-scale veal farming is not the way to a summer place in Mustique. Jon says each calf is worth about \u00a31,000, but once you subtract abattoir costs, butchery, feed and transport, that quickly gets whittled away, so he is about to do a butchery course, so he can manage that side himself. \"It's a bit daunting,\" he said, \"but it's interesting, and it means I'll have total control over the meat we sell. And we've had to learn everything so far as we went along, anyway.\"</p> <h2>Where to get it</h2> <p><strong>The Real Veal Vompany</strong><br>1 Bocaddon Cottages, Lanreath, near Looe, Cornwall, 01503 220991, <a href=\"http://www.bocaddonfarmveal.com\">bocaddonfarmveal.com</a></p> <p>You can buy the Browns' veal at Exeter, Truro an Lostwithiel farmers' markets, or by mail order.

  "<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Radiophonic Workshop, the BBC's experimental unit for electronic sound. It also marks the 10th anniversary of the workshop's death after a long period of decline. But almost as soon it was gone, it began to assume cult status. A Radiophonic ghost began to haunt the peripheries of pop culture, audible initially as an influence on \"retrofuturist\" groups such as Boards of Canada, Broadcast and Add N to (X). In the past five years, there has been a steady flow of Radiophonic-related reissues from labels such as Mute, Rephlex, Glo-Spot and Trunk; a BBC4 documentary, Alchemists of Sound; and a South Bank symposium organised by Saint Etienne's Bob Stanley. There have been two plays about the workshop's Delia Derbyshire, and when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005, unfavourable comparisons were made between the Radiophonic team's original electronic music and the orchestrated flatus of Murray Gold's updated version. This summer, the Southbank Centre held a symposium on Daphne Oram, the workshop's co-founder, and there was news about the discovery of a huge cache of unreleased material by Derbyshire, the workshop's most brilliant composer. In November, Mute is set to issue a double CD compilation, 50th Anniversary Retrospective, including nuggets never before released.</p> <p>The workshop is still best known for Doctor Who - not just the theme tune, but the array of sound effects that made the show so creepy, from spooky winds evoking the poisonous atmospheres of alien planets to the grotesque squelches of a slime monster crawling up Sarah Jane Smith's leg. Yet Doctor Who represented just a tiny fraction of the outfit's output, which covered radio plays, TV series and educational programming, countless jingles and theme tunes, and a number of major productions initiated by the workshop itself. Especially through its contributions to programmes for schools, the workshop filtered into the collective unconscious of young Britons during the 60s and 70s. \"We were part of your life,\" says Brian Hodgson, who created \"special sound\" for Doctor Who for its first 11 years - including such \"classics\" as the Tardis taking off and the voice of the Daleks. The workshop could be one reason why Britain has played such a vanguard role in the rise of electronic music, from 80s synthpop to 90s techno-rave. </p> <p>The workshop opened for business in a couple of rooms at the BBC's Maida Vale complex on April 1 1958. For several years before that, Oram had been pushing for the BBC to start its equivalent to French national radio's audio research unit GRMC, where the founder Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry pioneered the tape-editing techniques of musique concr\u00e8te. Unlike its Paris counterpart, the workshop began with a minuscule budget and meagre equipment. \"It was mainly secondhand - stuff the BBC had thrown out, peculiar devices that were useless until the workshop's original engineer, Richard 'Dickie' Bird, managed to get them working again,\" says Hodgson. Although the project was Oram's brainchild, she soon left. Concerned that working with experimental sound could result in brain disturbances or madness, the powers that be decreed people could work there for only three months. The rules were soon changed, but too late for Oram, who resigned from the BBC and built an independent studio to pursue her dream of a system that could enable the composer to \"draw\" sound.</p> <p>The BBC's music department was suspicious, verging on hostile, about the workshop's creation. The push came from the drama department. The workshop \"was much more part of the 50s theatre revolution than the music revolution\", according to Hodgson, who had trained as an actor before joining the BBC. The term \"workshop\" came from theatre, he says. \"It was a trendy term in the late 50s, but if the unit had been started a decade later, during the era of arts labs, it'd probably have been called the Radiophonic Laboratory.\" </p> <p>Through the 50s and into the 60s, the drama department encouraged new writers and formal experiments of all kinds. Producers started to mess around with the newly available reel-to-reel tape machines that were replacing the 78rpm platters on to which studio managers had recorded sound effects. \"If you accidentally left the fader open on a tape machine, you'd get this dreadful howl-round sound,\" recalls the chief engineer Dick Mills. \"But if you could control it, you got peculiar echo effects that created a kind of disembodied voice, which could be used to portray a character in a radio drama thinking aloud, or undergoing mental distress.\" In an increasingly chaotic environment of studio managers borrowing tape machines and forgetting to return them, the decision was made to create a unit dedicated to providing incidental music and sounds for anybody within the BBC who required them. </p> <p>One of the gems on The John Baker Tapes, released in July, is Baker's appearance on an early 60s edition of Woman's Hour to explain how he made a whimsically futuristic jingle for the show's \"reading your letters\" segment. A single glug from water poured out of a cider bottle supplied the timbre for the main melody, the dry pop of a cork being pulled out of another bottle served as percussion. Altering the speed of the tape varied the pitch and created a couple of octaves of notes; each individual note was then sliced and spliced into a sequence. Hours and hours of intricate work resulted in a jingle arresting enough to get readers writing in about the tune.</p> <p>On the continent, state-run stations such as Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise, Westdeutscher Rundfunk and Radio Italia funded their own sound laboratories dedicated to exploring the new tape-editing techniques and grappling with primitive devices, such as ring oscillators, for generating pure electronic sound. But whereas Bernard Parmegiani in Paris or Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne were allowed to engage in pure research, the workshop's activities were always tethered to the practical. The team had to earn their keep with futuristic jingles and wacky noises. \"We weren't composers flying our own kites,\" Mills says. \"Any experimenting we did was always within the context of someone's programme.\" It was craft, not art, with an aura redolent of an amateur cobbling together Heath Robinson-like contraptions in the garden shed. \"Because we're not experts,\" the workshop's indulgent manager, Desmond Briscoe, would say, \"we don't know what we shouldn't be able to do.\"</p> <p>Alongside its bodged quality, early Radiophonic output was often suffused with English surrealist humour. There was a comedy connection: The Goon Show was one of the workshop's early clients, with Mills creating such well-known effects as \"Major Bloodnok's Stomach\", an absurdist eruption of gastric turbulence that signalled the entrance of \"an Indian officer gentleman with a passion for hot curries and loose women\". According to the workshop composer Paddy Kingsland, \"Spike Milligan virtually wanted to take the place over; Desmond Briscoe talked of having to fight him off.\"</p> <p>Another difference between Radiophonic and its peers in Europe was the prominent role of women, from the co-founder Oram, through early composers such as Derbyshire and Maddalena Fagandini, to later figures Glynis Jones and Elizabeth Parker. Derbyshire had first sought employment at Decca Records, only to be rebuffed with \"we don't have women in engineering or technical roles\". By contrast, the BBC had a remarkably progressive policy in terms of equal employment opportunities. This went back at least as far as the second world war when, Hodgson says, \"the BBC was virtually run by women, because the men were off fighting\".</p> <p>Derbyshire is easily the most famous alumna. Her striking looks (\"tall, with beautiful auburn hair\", recalls Hodgson) and erratic life (heavy drinking, bouts of depression, eccentricity) contribute to the mystique. Mostly, though, it's about the remarkable music. A gifted mathematician, she plotted out her pieces with a scientist's precision. \"Blue Veils and Golden Sands\", music for a documentary about the Tuaregs of the Sahara and her most celebrated piece after the Doctor Who theme (written by Ron Grainer, but transformed by Derbyshire's electronic realisation), involved analysing a real-world sound source into \"all of its partials and frequencies\", then reconstructing it using the workshop's battery of oscillators. The original sound was almost comically prosaic: a standard-issue \"tatty green BBC lampshade\", she recalled in one interview, which gave off an ethereal bell-like sound when struck. </p> <p>The piece also involved Derbyshire's treated and chopped-up voice and \"slowed-down camel groans that were looped and filtered\", says the workshop archivist Mark Ayres, who has compiled the forthcoming CD set. Ayres has been slowly cataloguing and digitising the 4,000 reels (which contain approximately 3,000 hours) in the workshop's chaotic library, which once occupied three rooms but was shunted into a single room in Maida Vale during the unit's twilight years. Only a diehard fan would take on this labour of love, which involves painstakingly restoring tapes that have dried up or gone sticky because of myriad edits. </p> <p>Thanks to Doctor Who's popularity from the early 60s onwards, intrigued pop musicians began to pay visits to Maida Vale, including Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Rolling Stone Brian Jones. Paul McCartney approached Derbyshire with a view to her providing electronic backing for \"Yesterday\". It never happened, but later she did the music for one of Yoko Ono's experimental movies, Wrapping Piece. By this time the prim-voiced and \"impeccably dressed\" Derbyshire of the early Radiophonic days had thrown herself into the swinging 60s, adopting what Hodgson fondly calls her \"gypsy grandmother mode\" of clothing and going through, according to Mills, a period of \"funny-coloured tobacco, and snuff, and cider\". She and Hodgson formed an electronic research-and-performance entity called Unit Delta Plus, in collaboration with the inventor Peter Zinovieff, who set up a studio that was far better equipped than the workshop. After working all day at the BBC, they'd head down to Putney to work all evening there.</p> <p>The neophiliac mania that had buoyed the 60s was crashing hard by 1970, and the Radiophonic Workshop wasn't immune. The new synthesisers superseded tape-editing, and the balance shifted from \"soundsmiths\" (including Hodgson and Mills) to \"tunesmiths\" - new recruits such as Kingsland, who had played in rock bands. Television's hours and channels were expanding: Kingsland did the music and weird noises for the chilling children's series The Changes, set in a Luddite near-future when people turn against technology, and later scored both the radio and TV versions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</p> <p>In the 80s, the Radiophonic Workshop embraced the new digital technology of sequencers, samplers and MIDI (the machine that enables musicians to synch up all kinds of electronic devices). When Hodgson returned to take over from Briscoe as manager, his first priority was to modernise and re-equip. In addition to the huge demand from television, the workshop was initiating large-scale productions of its own, such as Peter Howell's Inferno Revisited, a reinterpretation of Dante. </p> <p>Yet while the 80s were in many ways triumphant years for the workshop, the music that Radiophonic cultists cherish tends to be from the early, makeshift days, when magical results were achieved by the most rudimentary means: tape, razor blades, found sounds. By the mid-80s, electronic music gear could be found in any Dixons. The function and future of the workshop had become cloudy. \"In a way, our success created the seeds of our destruction,\" says Hodgson. \"We'd got people used to electronic music and we'd pushed the technology that made the do-it-yourself thing possible. Nowadays a kid in his bedroom has more technological resources than we had for the first 25 years of the workshop. It's the democratisation of music.\"</p> <p>In the 90s, John Birt introduced reforms of the BBC designed to create a kind of internal market. For the workshop, \"producer choice\" - the slogan of the day - meant \"the big programmes could hire anybody they liked from outside\", Hodgson explains. \"As a result, the workshop sort of collapsed.\"</p> <p>Hodgson emphasises the workshop's radio and TV output for schools. He remembers a programme that taught geography by using the idea of a magic carpet whizzing across the globe. \"If you're a kid,\" he says, it can only be good for your imagination to hear the sound of a magic carpet taking off. </p> <p>The workshop fitted the Reithian concept of what a national broadcaster should be about: expanding the cultural horizons of the general public. Among the many contemporary outfits influenced by it is the London-based Ghost Box label. Julian House, the label's co-founder, aligns the workshop with the postwar spirit of planning and building for a better future that encompassed modernist architecture and urban planning, the Open University, and Penguin and Pelican paperbacks. \"It's now unthinkable,\" he says, \"that a public body could produce for the masses such avant-garde, forward-thinking, sometimes difficult music.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday October 15 2008.

  "<p>I am interested in this biography, being both subject of it and the author's friend. I believe he will remain a friend after reading this review, though it is written to correct his biggest mistake. </p> <p>We first knew each other well in 2000AD when I tutored him in creative writing at Glasgow University. Never having mastered a keyboard, I need secretaries to put my words into type. Working on books frequently and erratically, I employ computer-literate folk for long spells under temporary conditions, so few secretaries can put up with them; but for nearly two years and several periods afterwards Roger helped me finish a book of short stories and start my most recent novel, and put my early plays on to a website. </p> <p>The blurb of his biography quotes an extract saying that, when he proposed writing it, I shouted \"Be my Boswell\", danced a jig around the room, raised a finger to the heavens and cried: \"Tell the world of my genius.\" I am liable to facetious outbursts when relaxing with friends, so maybe that happened. I recall my first, more cautious reaction. I have sometimes thought of writing my own life story when short of better things, so suggested that Roger write a book called Working with Gray, dealing solely with his experience of me as teacher, secretary and friend. That was certainly an invitation to Boswellise me. Boswell's Life of Johnson is chiefly enjoyed for his personal reminiscences of an unusually wise, good, eccentric man, thus leading Macaulay to think Boswell was a poor soul fortunate in a great subject.</p> <p>In the best part of Alasdair Gray: A Secretary's Biography, Roger took my advice, drawing on a diary he kept. The result is a good portrait of the artist as a hard-working, happily married, sometimes short of money, occasionally drunk old writer, and as such it will amuse some readers and disgust others. These reminiscences are less entertaining than Boswell's because I am less interesting than Johnson and my conversation less witty. Boswell, supported by an unearned income, took 21 years to gather his materials and published his Life after Johnson's death. Roger lives by his writing, had known me six years before writing it, and had to earn a publisher's advance by completing it in not much more than a year. It still strikes me as true and even touching. Roger comes across as more worried by my poor health than ever I was.</p> <p>But his reminiscences are interspersed with accounts of my life since birth, accounts collated from my writings, interviews with friends and relations, and from my occasional remarks. I did not want to read this biography before it was published because 1) it would distract me from my own work and 2) critics must not think I had a hand in it. The Arts of Alasdair Gray (1991) and Alasdair Gray: Critical Appreciations (2002) contained essays written by friends or by folk who sounded like friends. I had supplied both with pictorial illustrations so appeared to have given them (Roger says) my \"stamp of approval\"; though Robert Crawford and Thomas Nairn had complete editorial control and neither consulted me about the texts, some critics thought them frontmen for manipulative Gray. So it was important that this biography be written by someone free of me. It certainly is, which explains the many mistakes I could easily have corrected. </p> <p>Examples: when cellulitis lamed me in 2005 I was on holiday with my son and his family in Iona, not Skye. In 1999 my preface to the Book of Jonah, published by Canongate, was not denounced by Jewish and Christian fundamentalists but by Jewish and Muslim fundamentalists. Such wee errors will not annoy most readers. But Roger is seriously mistaken in saying that in 1991 I married Morag, my second wife, having given up hope of my first wife, Inge, returning to me after a 20-year separation. </p> <p>Having invited Roger to Boswellise me I should never have casually gossiped about my first marriage when depressed by the funerals of friends. I was grateful to Inge for marrying me when she was 17 and I was a 26-year-old eczemic asthmatic who kept giving up gainful employment as a school teacher to paint pictures I could not sell. I was and am grateful to her for bearing my son, Andrew. I left her in 1970 when love between us grew impossible, and lived nearby as a friend so that my Andrew still thought of me as his dad. For 21 years after separating our marriage stayed legal, a useful arrangement that made marrying other partners impossible - I am glad I never mentioned these to Roger. We at last divorced when she wanted to marry again, and a while later I married Morag in whose home I now lived, knowing I would never want to live with anyone else. It is daft to say I married her on the rebound from a wife I left 20 years earlier. Had Inge invited me to cohabit again with her in those years I would have refused. </p> <p>Having said that, please enjoy Roger's book. I will not authorise another biography.</p>",

Money has been piling in to National Savings ever since the Northern Rock debacle; last month it announced it had enjoyed its strongest ever annual sales performance.</p> <p>The price of safety is high. You can usually get better rates elsewhere - and NS&amp;I this week slashed rates on some of its most popular products, including fixed-interest savings certificates, children's bonus bonds and guaranteed-income bonds. But in the current environment, some worried savers won't care that the rates aren't the best you can get.</p> <p>Is your money really absolutely safe? \"There is no way you could lose your money,\" a spokeswoman assured us.</p> <p>In terms of what's on offer, its Easy Access Savings Account has been popular among those looking for a no-hassle, no-frills home for their cash, even though its rates of interest are less than impressive. It is an instant-access account which comes with a cash card that lets you pay in money at post office branches and make withdrawals from ATMs. It can be opened with \u00a3100 or more, and has tiered interest rates, paying between 1.85% gross interest (for deposits of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3999) and 4.4% (\u00a350,000-plus).</p> <p>Those looking for a better rate of interest might want to consider the NS&amp;I Direct Isa, paying a tax-free 5.3%. The minimum opening deposit is \u00a31,000, and it is aimed at those happy to manage their account by phone and online.</p> <p>If you're a higher-rate taxpayer and/or you're worried that inflation will hang around for a while, it's worth taking a gander at National Savings' index-linked savings certificates. As inflation has surged, so has the attractiveness of these lump-sum savings products. With index-linked savings certificates, the value of your investment increases in line with inflation (as measured by the Retail Prices Index) and earns guaranteed interest on top - with all your returns tax-free. These three- and five-year savings products currently give higher-rate taxpayers a savings rate equivalent to around 9.5%.</p> <p>To get the best return you have to stay in for the full term, although you can get out after one year and still benefit from index-linking and extra interest. You can invest between \u00a3100 and \u00a315,000 per issue.</p> <p>The bad news is that rates on some of NS&amp;I's fixed-rate investments were this week hacked by up to 0.75%. It means the latest issue of children's bonus bonds now pay 3.7%. Those on sale little more than a year ago were paying 5.1%. Nevertheless, if you want to save for a child, and do not want to take risks, these are well worth considering. They are five-year fixed rate products that can be bought by anyone over 16 for a child under 16. You can deposit between \u00a325 and \u00a33,000 in each issue, and all returns are tax-free for both child and parent.</p> <p>The rates on the two- and five-year fixed-interest savings certificates, which offer a guaranteed tax-free return, have fallen to just 2.95%.</p> <p>You would have thought that NS&amp;I would have been quick to crow about how much lovely money it has been pulling in lately. Last year, at the height of the Northern Rock crisis, it was happy to give out this information, but now it appears the government has gagged its savings bank. \"We do have a new policy at NS&amp;I that we will not issue sales figures outside of our quarterly reporting in order not to rock the financial markets,\" says the spokeswoman, who adds that it is too early to say if the current instability has affected sales.</p> <p>Talking of Northern Rock, thanks to the government's intervention, the Newcastle-based institution is also able to offer its customers a guarantee that any money in its accounts - whether it's \u00a31 or \u00a31m - is 100% secure. However, this is not an open-ended commitment; if and when Northern Rock returns to the private sector, it is likely to be put on to a similar footing as other banks and building societies.</p> <h2>Are my savings safe?</h2> <p>Lloyds TSB's rescue of Halifax's parent company HBOS - a deal reportedly brokered by the prime minister - suggests there is an implicit state guarantee of the major high street banks, and all the money people have saved with them. In other words, HBOS, HSBC, Barclays and the like are simply too large, and too crucial to the economy, to be allowed to fail. If you follow that logic, big is definitely best.</p> <h2>Shouldn't I just put it all under the mattress?</h2> <p>Don't go there. If your cash is nicked, home insurance policies typically pay out somewhere between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 for stolen money.</p> <h2>So what should savers do?</h2> <p>Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you've got a fair bit of cash, spread your savings around a number of different institutions. Check who owns the bank or runs its savings operation. That's because people could be left out of pocket if they have their money in two or more savings providers that happen to be part of the same banking group, which then collapses.</p> <p>If you've got less than \u00a335,000 in an account, you can relax: you will get all your money back. If you have more tied up in one institution, now may be the time to think about finding another home for some of it.</p> <h2>Which bank will be the next to get into trouble?</h2> <p>That's one of the $64,000 dollar questions! Who, a few weeks ago, would have thought that the mighty HBOS - the Tesco of the banking world - would have to be rescued? Royal Bank of Scotland's share price has certainly had a torrid time of it, falling by 10% on Tuesday, 10% the next day and 4.5% on Thursday. The Guardian's Nils Pratley wrote on Thursday that RBS \"shares some of HBOS's financial characteristics. The size of RBS's loan book exceeds the size of its deposit base - not to the same degree, but the number is still large\". But he added that RBS is a bigger, more diversified bank.</p> <h2>What happens if my bank or building society goes bust, and will I lose all my money?</h2> <p>There is an official rescue fund called the Financial Services Compensation Scheme that protects savers if their bank or building society goes under. Payouts are \"per person per bank\", and were made more generous following the Northern Rock debacle. If your savings provider goes belly-up, you will now receive the first \u00a335,000 of your savings money back, and there are proposals to raise this to \u00a350,000. The \u00a335,000 limit applies to the total amount held with an organisation, regardless of how many accounts someone has, or whether they are a single or joint account holder.</p> <h2>I have all my savings at Halifax. Are they safe?</h2> <p>Probably more so than they were earlier this week. The merger is designed to shore up HBOS and protect the millions of savers who hold a total of \u00a3243bn in their accounts. Even if the new combined bank should fail, savers would be protected under the compensation scheme.</p> <p>Prudence suggests that you do not hold more than \u00a335,000 at any one institution. But prudence might also suggest that you think carefully before moving the cash to smaller banks offering better rates. Not all of them will be able to clamber into the lifeboat.</p> <h2>I have accounts at both Halifax and Lloyds TSB. What should I do?</h2> <p>Until the deal is done and dusted, which could take months, the two banks will continue to be treated as separate institutions, so customers will get protection for the first \u00a335,000 they hold in each. It will be interesting to see what happens when the merger is complete. In the case of Royal Bank of Scotland, which took over NatWest a few years back, most of its banking brands are separately authorised by the Financial Services Authority. So someone with money in RBS, NatWest, Tesco Personal Finance (which is 50%-owned by RBS) and Coutts would get a separate helping of protection for each of these.</p> <p>Other banks have done things differently. For example, the HBOS group includes Halifax, the Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires and Intelligent Finance. Birmingham Midshires also provides savings accounts for Saga and the AA. At the moment, all six of these brands operate under a single FSA authorisation, which means that if someone had \u00a335,000 in a Halifax account, and the same amount in accounts with Birmingham Midshires, the AA and Saga, and HBOS went bust tomorrow, instead of getting \u00a3140,000 compensation, they would only get \u00a335,000.</p> <h2>It all sounds horribly complicated ...</h2> <p>It is. MPs on the Commons Treasury select committee this week said it is unreasonable to expect customers to know whether their savings provider has an individual or a shared banking licence. They have urged the FSA to look into requiring each banking brand to have its own authorisation.</p> <h2>What'll happen to Howard Brown, the singing star of those annoying Halifax ads?</h2> <p>On Thursday, the Sun stuck Brown on its front page and said it was unclear whether he would be keeping his job. The paper rigged up an image of him riding a Lloyds TSB black horse, which might give the ad men some ideas. Only last month, the Star reported that he had been axed from the ads \"because he is too cheery for the credit crunch\".</p> <h2>My wife and I have a joint account. What happens to us?</h2> <p>The good news for people with joint accounts is that they effectively enjoy twice the normal level of protection. The compensation scheme will assume the money is split equally between the two account holders, so each person would be eligible for the full \u00a335,000 compensation. In other words, up to \u00a370,000 would be covered.</p> <h2>Doesn't all this prove I should put all my savings in a building society?</h2> <p>Once viewed as boring, building societies such as the Nationwide have come into their own lately, with many savers seeing them as a safe haven in times of trouble. They are immune from speculative attacks by hedge funds because they are not quoted on the stockmarket. And the sector is proud of the fact that no member of a building society has lost any of their investment since at least 1945. Also, building societies tend to help their own, with one usually stepping in if another gets into trouble.</p> <h2>I thought some building societies were putting money into all sorts of dodgy things?</h2> <p>The sector's reputation as safe and unsexy took a blow this month when it emerged that more than a quarter of Derbyshire Building Society's balance sheet was made up of adverse credit and sub-prime loans. Nationwide has seen its lending volume drop by 40% and booked losses of more than \u00a3100m on six structured investment vehicles, while more than a quarter of lending by Britannia, the second-biggest society, is in areas such as buy-to-let, credit impaired and \"self-cert\" loans.</p> <h2>What if my money is in the UK arm of an overseas bank?</h2> <p>If it is the UK division of a non-European bank, for example ICICI Bank UK, which is owned by one of India's largest financial institutions, the protection is exactly the same as that applying to British-owned banks.</p> <h2>What if the parent company is based in Europe?</h2> <p>It's slightly more complicated. EU rules mean all countries in the European Economic Area must have a compensation scheme in place, but in most cases these schemes are less generous than the UK's (France and Italy are the exceptions). However, European banks have the option of joining our scheme to \"top up\" the level of protection offered, and most reputable European banks with a UK presence have done just that. This means you would end up being entitled to the same amount, but the compensation would be provided by two schemes.</p> <h2>Which European banks have topped up?</h2> <p>They include ING Direct and Triodos Bank (both with parent companies in the Netherlands), Bank of Ireland (which provides many of the Post Office's savings accounts) and Landsbanki. For a list, log on to <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/consumer/How_to_Claim/Deposits/EEA_firms_that_have_topped_up\">fscs.org.uk</a>.</p> <h2>How's Barclays faring?</h2> <p>Barclays bounced back this week by snapping up some of Lehman Brothers' prime US assets for what many said was a bargain price. But analysts are still concerned about its wholesale funding gap which though less than half the level of RBS or HBOS, is still huge. </p> <h2>What about HSBC?</h2> <p>HSBC has made huge losses because of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, but its shares have outperformed its rivals. This week it became the world's biggest bank by market value - though how long it will retain that title ...</p> <h2>Abbey?</h2> <p>Abbey is probably fortunate that it was taken over by Spanish banking giant Santander, which is also in the process of swallowing up Alliance &amp; Leicester. Santander is regarded as one of Europe's strongest banks, partly because it has little or no exposure to the US sub-prime mortgage market. But problems in the Spanish property market could drag it down. </p> <h2>How about Bradford &amp; Bingley?</h2> <p>The former building society and leading buy-to-let lender has endured a savage few months. Its share price was just 25p on Thursday; in April they were worth more than \u00a32. A few days ago, Moody's, the ratings agency, slashed its credit rating. If things carry on like this, Mr Bradford and Mr Bingley will soon be found sitting in a shop doorway, asking passers-by to throw a few coppers into their bowler hats.</p> <h2>I'm an HBOS shareholder. How much will I get?</h2> <p>There are nearly two million Brits who hold shares in HBOS, which tumbled from \u00a310 this time last year to 88p in frantic trading before the rescue by Lloyds TSB. Assuming the deal goes ahead, HBOS shareholders will see each share exchanged for 0.83 shares in Lloyds TSB instead. At the time the deal was announced, that worked out as 232p per HBOS share. But the next day, the Lloyds TSB share price dropped to around 230p, so that meant HBOS holders would receive shares worth 190.9p. The next few months will be tortuous as the deal has to be approved. It's entirely possible that in the meantime speculators will drive down Lloyds TSB's share price.</p>",
  "<h2>Go tree-seed gathering</h2> <p>Summer is officially over and the arrival of autumn sees the start of seed-gathering season, a month-long festival organised by the Tree Council to encourage us to collect and plant seeds, fruits and nuts. The idea is that the seeds you've gathered locally (as opposed to bought at a garden centre) will be perfectly adapted to the soil and climate in your area.</p> <p>The Tree Council will be running events across the country, or you could just collect seeds in your local park. You'll need paper bags or envelopes (plastic bags trap moisture, which rots the seeds) and a tree guide so you know what you are gathering. Keep things simple by sticking to nut-type seeds, such as acorns and conkers, or winged types, such as ash, and make sure to choose seeds that haven't been nibbled by animals. Then plant your seeds in pots filled with compost. Water them occasionally over the winter and, with a bit of luck, you'll be able to plant them out in the spring. You might have to wait a few years for a mighty oak, though.</p> <p>Visit the Tree Council website at <a href=\"http://treecouncil.org.uk\">treecouncil.org.uk</a>.

The easiest way to make a dye is to collect onion skins. These will produce a vibrant yellow colour. You need about 500g of skins, which will make enough dye for three or four T-shirts. First boil your white shirts with some washing powder in five litres of water for 60 minutes and then leave to soak for 24 hours. Reheat the water until warm and mix in two tablespoons of cream of tartar. This will fix the dye. Leave the T-shirts to soak for 24 hours then rinse. Boil the onion skins for about an hour in 10 litres of water until the water is dark. Remove the onions and add the T-shirts. Keep the water warm but under boiling point until your T-shirts are dyed to the degree you want. Rinse them a few times before hanging out to dry. To create patterns, roll the material into sausage shapes and tie them tightly with string before putting in the dye. Don't be surprised when these items of clothing become hot favourites with the children.<br><strong>Vincent Reid</strong></p> <p>For more ideas see <a href=\"http://tilz.tearfund.org/Publications/\">http://tilz.tearfund.org/Publications/</a></p>",
  "<h2>Protect your pond</h2> <p>If you have trees overhanging your garden pond, throw a length of pea netting, or similar, over it now, before the leaves start falling. This simple act will save you from having to fish them out later with a net. If you've never done either - the netting or the net - I'll bet you've got a problem with blanket weed. A build-up of rotting debris at the bottom of a pond is one of the things that causes such troublesome algae in the first place, so prevention now should mean clearer water and less work next summer.</p> <h2>Turn tomatoes red</h2> <p>Putting your green tomatoes on a sunny windowsill to ripen will just give you unripe tomatoes with extra-tough skin. That's because, once a tomato is off the plant, it prefers a bit of gloom to ripen up in. If you want your crop to ripen quickly, pop them in a paper bag with a banana skin, and pop the whole thing in a drawer. For a succession of slow-ripening tomatoes, stack them in an airy crate and store them in a dark place, and skip the banana skin. Check and eat regularly.</p> <h2>Plant of the week</h2> <p>A Japanese maple is a petite yet powerful autumnal presence. Acer palmatum 'Crimson Queen' has finely dissected, purple foliage all summer that turns red in autumn. It wants some sun and shelter from winds.

  "<p>Instant gardens normally belong to the realm of the TV makeover: decking in a hurry with a nail gun and horticulture all but hidden. Yet Keith and Ros Wiley have spent some 20 years developing and fine-tuning a style of gardening that is almost all about plants. One of the many benefits of this approach is that it gives results fast.</p> <p>It took the Wileys just four years to carve out a one-and-a-half-acre garden from a flat field in Devon, and much of the planting looked great in its first year. Keith remembers contouring the earth of one bed in the morning, planting it up in the afternoon and his wife deeming it good enough to paint that same evening.</p> <p>But this is a wet, windy site facing south on a hilltop, and planted windbreaks take 10 years. So Keith used a mini digger to throw up 2m banks and dig down a further 2m, in so doing contouring the land, pushing the wind over the top, creating shade and improving drainage. </p> <p>The garden looks stunning in September (above), but it peaks earlier in summer, with kniphofia, agapanthus, day lilies and crocosmia. For winter there are witchhazels, heathers, crocus, snowdrops and early daffodils. Keith's goal is to see sheets of colour at all times. Perennials and bulbous plants tend to fill out quickly, so, coupled with the sheer volume of plant material here, success is swift.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Creating a garden in a hurry leaves little time for maintenance. Everything is cut down at Christmas, then weeded and mulched with stable manure, with just one further weeding session in spring</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Taller plants such as Campanula lactiflora are cut back in mid-May, and asters in June, so that they branch and remain compact, which makes them self-supporting without the need for staking</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In winter, once everything has been cut down, the rolling banks have a presence of their own, like a Henry Moore sculpture, which soon becomes smothered in spring flowering bulbs</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Unexpectedly for this style of planting, there are dozens of Japanese maples, but this is loosely naturalistic planting inspired by the wild, and the wild doesn't have rules</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The slopes create a greater surface area for planting than a piece of flat ground, so as you look across at the banks, you see a phenomenal amount of plants in any one view</p>",
  "<p><strong>We recently pulled down an ivy that grew through a large wild cherry tree, and there are now no leaves on the tree's lower branches. Can we cut it back to stimulate new growth? We are in a conservation area, but I believe we are allowed to pollard.</strong></p> <p>Hold it right there. Don't even think about doing a single thing to a tree in a conservation area without seeking permission first. But before doing that, you need to work out just what it is you want to do - and it certainly isn't pollarding. Cutting back, as you might a lanky bedding fuchsia, won't work, although it may produce 'water shoots': that is, thin, straight stress growths that are no good to anyone. And do nothing for a while, anyway, because the tree may just recover by itself. Give it a few treats - an autumn mulch of composted leaves, a spring feed, water and mulch - to increase its chances. If you find you need to remove the dead lower branches, call in a qualified arborist and fill out all the necessary forms.</p> <p><strong>What's the best way to tackle extremely vigorous ground elder that is taking over my shrubs and hedge, and encroaching on my neighbour's garden.</strong></p> <p>This is a big problem, and the road will be long, fiddly and boring. But it can be done. Start by digging up the rhizomes, which are the source of the brute's strength. However, I am rather concerned about your shrubs, because the elder will be all around the roots. By far the best course of action is to dig them all up, clean them off and replant them in pots or in elder-free areas of the garden, which will be a lot of fun. After all that, you will still have a problem, but at least it will be one that's under some control. You will need to use a weedkiller to finish the job. Paint any remaining elder stems this autumn with a glyphosate-based weedkiller, such as Roundup. Repeat next summer, once there is plenty of growth, and then endlessly until it's gone.</p>",
  "<p>Union leaders yesterday buried the hatchet and rallied to Gordon Brown's side ahead of the party conference, claiming that his promise to clean up the City was a clear sign he was throwing off the shackles of \"New Labour\".</p> <p>Derek Simpson, the joint general secretary of Unite, Labour's biggest affiliate, also claimed triumphantly: \"The rump of \u00fcber Blairites that had called for a leadership election have no roots in Labour and have failed to win support for their coup - their grip on the party is slipping, and not before time.\"</p> <p>Denouncing so-called forces of conservatism within the party, Simpson claimed the existence of the rebel faction had been the main obstacle to a change in policy on housing, the NHS, and job and pension security. \"The rebels' rump had been calling for the same ideology and policies that had allowed big city bankers to gamble away our future prosperity.\"</p> <p>In an unrestrained assault, Simpson claimed: \"The spectacle of the political has-beens and never-weres queuing up to criticise the prime minister over the last few weeks has been pitiful.\"</p> <p>He hailed Brown for saying stronger regulation of the financial sector was essential and for recognising the struggle that millions of families faced with their winter household bills. \"There is a real sign now that Gordon Brown will throw off the shackles of New Labour and win back disaffected Labour voters.\" </p> <p>Simpson's outspoken attack came as Unite prepared to reveal that its outlay, to help Labour develop a more sophisticated direct mailshot service aimed at key marginal seats, had reached \u00a32m. </p> <p>Unite, looking at the close links between the unions and Democrats in the US, is also trying to invigorate its potentially key activists by regularly canvassing members by phone and email in all the marginal constituencies. </p> <p>In Glenrothes, the site of a byelection for Brown in November, Unite activists are already regularly phoning their 4,000 members. The union has also surveyed 100,000 of its members by post and phone in marginal seats to check out the disaffection with Labour and the issues likely to bring them back to the fold.</p> <p>The union survey revealed that 77% of its members had voted Labour at some point, but now only 40% backed the government as opposed to 23% who claimed to be Conservatives. Asked to rank issues in order of importance, those surveyed put immigration top (25%), hospitals second (22%) alongside crime, then the economy (19%), followed by pensions, housing and education. The high number citing immigration was regarded as an embarrassment in some parts of the union, but others saw the issue as a symbol of a wider resentment against unfairness.</p> <p>Labour leaders are expecting the conference to reveal a big swell of support for Brown, following the attacks from rebels, and in recognition of his handling of the financial crisis. But they admit that the tests for him will come in the content of his speech on Tuesday, and in his ability to keep his parliamentary party united afterwards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, ruffled feathers in the cabinet when she openly backed the Democrats in the US presidential election during an appearance on BBC Question Time. One cabinet source said it was not acceptable for the deputy leader to call for party discipline and then veer away from the agreed position of neutrality. </p> <p>The day after his speech the prime minister is going to New York for a meeting of the UN special general assembly where he will see several key leaders, including George Bush and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to discuss the financial crisis. He is also expected to discuss the possibility of kick-starting the world trade talks, though few expect any progress until after the US elections in November.</p>",
  "<p>A far-right group was forced to abandon a press conference launching a campaign against plans for a new mosque and Muslim immigration in the German city of Cologne yesterday, when protesters targeted them with stones and paint.</p> <p>\"Mosques are shooting out of the ground like mushrooms\" and \"headscarves are flooding our streets\", were among the inflammatory statements the Pro-Cologne group used to drum up support for its three-day \"Anti-Islamisation Conference\".</p> <p>But the talks were disrupted early on when stone-throwing protesters pelted a boat on the Rhine River, the stage for the opening press conference, eventually forcing organisers to scrap the event. Windows were smashed and police arrested six people.</p> <p>Nearby around 500 of the protesters formed a human chain to defend the site where the city plans to build the mosque, Germany's largest, complete with two 55 metre-high (180ft) minarets.</p> <p>Pro-Cologne has run a vociferous campaign against the development, winning it a degree of local support and some seats on the city council.</p> <p>According to organisers, the aim of the conference was to forge a \"European, patriotic, populist rightwing movement\" by uniting far-right speakers and supporters from across Europe. Among plans for yesterday was a tour of \"multi-ethnic hotspots\".</p> <p>German government officials spoke out against the talks, saying it would be divisive for the city where more than a third of the 1 million residents are not German, but mostly of Turkish origin. \"Such an event organised by populists and extremists in Cologne is damaging to the good cooperation between the city and its Muslim citizens,\" Gabriele Hermani, a spokeswoman for the interior ministry, said.</p> <p>Islamic nations, including Iran, also called for the event to be banned, saying it reflected a \"growth of anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe\".</p> <p>Counter-protests, organised by charities, Muslim groups and trade unions, are expected to dwarf tomorrow's far-right demonstration at the site of the new mosque, which is the centrepiece of the Pro-Cologne rally. </p> <p>In what police described as one of their \"most difficult assignments\", 3,000 officers from all over the state of North Rhine-Westphalia were being sent to Cologne. Yesterday, police arrested protesters on both sides and stepped in to shield a man of foreign appearance who was chased by far-right protesters.</p> <p>The rally has put Cologne at the centre of a heated debate in Germany about Islam and integration, to the dismay of mainstream politicians.</p> <p>Cologne's mayor, Fritz Schramma, sent a strong message to the city to shun the far-right: \"Shut your windows and doors, lower your shutters,\" he said. \"Make it clear to Pro-Cologne and its camarilla: You are not welcome in Cologne.\"</p>",
  "<p>It may be that more people have read JK Galbraith in 2008 than in any year of the American economist's long life. His book, The Great Crash 1929, has become one of the key texts of our times; like other key texts drawn from the experience of our ancestors - the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, say, read to an audience of Calvinists with syphilis - it has become the awful warning we chose to ignore, as well as the guide to what happens next. But obviously not enough people have read it - not enough financiers or their prey (for yea, Lord, we are weak) - so it does no harm to quote him on the subject of confidence. </p> <p>What caused Wall Street's \"speculative orgy\" in the years preceding 1929? Galbraith rejects the explanation of cheap and easy credit as \"obviously nonsense\". Borrowing money had been just as easy at other times without causing a boom, and interest rates in the late 1920s were high relative to the years since; Galbraith was writing in 1954. </p> <p>Far more important was the mood. \"Speculation on a large scale requires a pervasive sense of confidence and optimism and conviction that ordinary people were meant to be rich,\" says Galbraith. \"People must also have faith in the good intentions and even in the benevolence of others, for it is by the agency of others that they will get rich ... Such a feeling of trust is essential for a boom. When people are cautious, questioning, misanthropic, suspicious, or mean, they are immune to speculative enthusiasms.\" </p> <p>The passage itself is good example of the feeling it describes: it is confident, written with brio and without the evidence-bound circumspection or careful prolixity of many newer economic historians. This week I asked an investment banker how she persuaded her customers to feel confident in her. \"To create confidence you sound clear and you sound definite,\" she said, before remembering this was how Lehman Brothers and HBOS sounded until almost the very end. Not enough investors believed them, which suggests Galbraith is right. Confidence exuded is not necessarily confidence accepted. When the going gets rough, people become \"cautious, questioning, misanthropic\". Another banker put it a different way: \"Today's confidence is tomorrow's panic attack.\" </p> <p>The bipolarity of the market is well known. Booms and bubbles are caused by greed, busts and crashes by fear. Confidence hasn't the raw properties of either, but shadows both like a more subtly coloured line rising and dipping across each economic cycle. The Shorter Oxford gives its first definition as \"the mental attitude of trusting in or relying on; firm trust, reliance, faith\", but subsequent definitions come closer to the way the word applies in the City and Wall Street: \"assurance, assured expectation ... excess of assurance, hardihood, presumption, impudence.\" Trust and confidence may be slightly different things - trust between people, confidence in assets and institutions - but, without a mixture of both, money at its most elemental level could not exist. Money itself is a puzzling abstraction. \"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of ... \" is still the legend on bank notes, but the sum can be expressed only as coinage or another banknote; an equivalent in precious metal was abandoned after Britain left the gold standard in 1931. \"So the legend on the note is either a tautology or a lie,\" said the writer James Buchan whose book, Frozen Desire, offers the most imaginative account of money's history. </p> <p>Confidence is what puts money to work. According to Buchan, \"There's nothing real about money. On a computer screen you can't even touch it. Confidence is the basis of all money and all financial transactions. You need confidence in the other party's word, confidence that they're solvent, confidence that the law of the land will be enforced. The final element is confidence that the person you're doing business with knows what he's doing. There hasn't been so much of that recently.\"</p> <p>But confidence is a feeling, a \"mental attitude\" as the Oxford says. Reasoning may lie behind it, but not always, perhaps not even often. Long before Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the American Federal Reserve, used the phrase \"irrational exuberance\" to describe the stockmarket boom in the 1990s, economists were studying the collective irrationality of investors. The old view, that markets were efficient and \"rational\" because investors chose stocks that they thought would in future yield the best dividends, came under attack from the \"behaviourist\" school of economists after the 1987 crash. Professor Robert Shiller at Yale had studied Wall Street's performance since the 1920s and concluded that the market was far too volatile to reflect the choices of thoughtful men researching a company's prospects, allowing for their context in the general trading outlook, and then doing some mathematics on a calculator. Surveys of active investors showed their decisions were often emotional. Three years ago, in the preface to the second edition of a book that pinched Greenspan's phrase for its title, Shiller warned that \"the stockmarket has not come down to historical levels ... People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes.'</p> <p>To another American academic, Brooke Harrington, \"irrationality\" can't be considered a form of deviancy, even in the markets; it's how people are. Harrington, a sociologist, studied investment clubs formed by the amateur investors who poured billions into Wall Street and came a cropper when the dotcom bubble burst. They were often the product of two forces: the postwar drive to obliterate memories of the great crash by awakening Americans to the rewards of \"people's capitalism\"; and the need for people to plant any disposable income in shares that, with luck, would provide for their old age and ill-health (with their Peps and Isas and private pension plans, successive British governments have deliberately promoted a similar ambition). The mismatch in motivation between professional traders and the amateurs was obvious - two streams of money in the same market chasing different results - but little of this seems to have mattered in the 1990s. Harrington's book, Pop Finance, shows that the amateurs mainly selected shares by drawing on their experience as workers or consumers. A male bus driver, say, would choose an automotive stock. But women, even though most had careers outside the home, would nearly always choose a share in something that could be bought off a shelf. Also, many of them wanted a moral dimension. \"They wanted to make money but they also wanted to look like good people,\" Harrington said. And when she went back after the bubble burst? \"They'd say 'Yeah, we knew we were pawns, but what we gonna do, put the money in the mattress?'\"</p> <p>Fear, Harrington said, had driven them just as much as greed - in a state with minimal social provision and low bank interest, fear prodded them into the market. Is fear any more rational than greed? Especially when, as usual, it drives investors out of the market? This week a lot was made of the herd instinct. Nobody can doubt that the shareholder flight that drove HBOS down looked like a group activity, exacerbated by the media, but at root the herd instinct remains an ancient, pre-human phenomenon much studied by zoologists and still in some ways hard to explain (Harrington mentioned the death of the Princess of Wales). A combination of contagious panic and speculation by short-sellers - that would be the HBOS story according to Vince Cable (\"aggressive speculators betting against the taxpayer\"), Alex Salmond (\"spivs and city slickers\") and the Daily Mirror (\"greedy pigs\"). British and American governments, perhaps reacting to popular anger, banned short-selling and stocks rose. By the end of the week, however, a different explanation of HBOS's demise became current. Nothing as technically mysterious to the City outsider as shorting, or as hard to penetrate as the behaviour of crowds, but instead thousands of individual decisions to sell up and get out, each of them perfectly rational in its self-interest. Who's to say we wouldn't do the same?</p> <p>The two most popular - because fictional - bank runs in history occur at the Fidelity Fiduciary in London and the Buildings &amp; Loan in Bedford Falls. The films Mary Poppins and It's a Wonderful Life each had villains, the equivalent of today's short-seller, in the respective form of the London bank owner and James Stewart's near-nemesis, Mr Potter. Unwittingly and otherwise, they caused the feverish crowds to besiege the bank counters. But the runs were on deposits, as at Northern Rock, and not on shares. In the newly arrived atmosphere of misanthropy and suspicion, HBOS's shareholders had several months to read the runes. The Financial Services Authority and the Treasury insisted HBOS was a well-funded and well-managed business, the country's largest provider of mortgages and savings accounts, with a market capitalisation of \u00a37.8bn and a pre-tax profit for the first six months of this year of \u00a3848m. The figures can't be disputed. Suspicion of a darker future was the powerful thing. </p> <p>A banker told me, \"The market's concerns about HBOS go back some time. It had put all its eggs in one basket - houses. It even owned buildings firms - it was ceasing to be a diversified institution. Houses, houses, houses - the whole model of vertical integration - which meant that its assets had gone down by 11% and were due in the next year to fall the same again. And it was raising half its mortgage funding on the wholesale market [other banks], and the wholesale market has frozen. If you're going to put all your eggs in one basket, it's quite important to pick the right basket.\"</p> <p>There was more to his list. Portents can be very small. On his way to work a few months ago, the banker had seen a hoarding at London Bridge station advertising an HBOS saving account with interest at 10%. \"That smacked of desperation. If it was such a well-funded institution why was it trying to attract punters with such a high rate? It was a ruinous advertising campaign.\" </p> <p>Halifax shares kept on falling; in early summer, shorting may have added to the slide. But the cause of the final fall that took the shares to 88p on Wednesday wasn't Vince Cable's shorters - who weren't betting against the taxpayer but on a continuing fall in the price. Events in America at Lehman Brothers and AIG (and earlier at Bear Stearns) taught Halifax shareholders that if the government intervened, as everyone assumed it would have to, then the shareholder could be left with nothing. \"Look at it this way,\" the banker said. \"Lehman Brothers was always 'too big to fail', but its shares fell from $70 to nothing. If you got out of Lehman last Friday you got $11. If you left it to Monday you got zero dollars. Shareholders got wiped out. The moment there's a panic you have to realise whatever value's left.\"</p> <p>This is the fickle system we are wedded to, no matter how much it may be \"cleaned-up\". First confidence, then less confidence, then no confidence. The third can last for a long time. As Galbraith tells us, Wall Street took 25 years to recover its pre-crash value of 1929. I asked the banker when he thought the bottom might be reached. \"I've no idea, but whenever it is, remember that just because the market's touched bottom doesn't mean it's not going to stay there.\" Which banker would have said that in confident 2006?</p>",
  "<p>For a really successful novelist, there can be few scarier things than writing your first book after killing off a long, vastly popular series. After Aubrey-Maturin, where next? Harry Potter's pensioned off before he needs hair restorer, but does that leave his globally famous creator anywhere to go? Different authors have different solutions. Patrick O'Brian died just before his series ended, which was characteristically shrewd, if a little extreme. Some authors change tack or invent a new hero/heroine/fantasy world. </p> <p>After 20 years Ian Rankin, onlie begetter of Rebus, seems barely to have paused before charging straight back to the keyboard. He appears not even to have had the common decency to go through a mid-life crisis and disappear for a year to drink himself silly. Instead he's produced a new thriller with new characters, and only familiar geography to reassure the fan.</p> <p>Brave man. For this is not quite the Edinburgh of Rebus. The unforgettably self-hating, chewed-up-and-spitting-out Scottish detective, slouching with hangover groans through shades of American film noir and shadows of Stevenson and Hogg, carried his city around with him. He was dry enough to make sardony a word and sucked the sunlight out of Scotland's capital. The Edinburgh of Rankin's new novel also has its skirt of pebble-dashed, scummy menace, its forgotten council schemes, piss-stained billiard halls and awesomely violent thugs. But it seems a touch more balanced without that half-mad, grey-and-liver-coloured face glaring back at it.</p> <p>The story starts with a far lighter touch, too. Three men dream up the perfect art heist. One is a computer millionaire, retired early with his toys and now bored. One is a grouchy professor of art. One is a nervous banker who feels life is passing him by. There's an almost John Buchan mood: three chaps settling down for a final big adventure, egging one another on as they knock back their drams. Their scheme is both simple and clever; I won't give it away. Yet I felt slightly disappointed.</p> <p>The feeling quickly passed. One of the problems of a long and successful series, whether it's about sailors or child magicians or detectives, is that eventually the characters and the setting start to overwhelm the narrative. What Rankin has done is to free himself from the detail and murk that a Rebus devotee would expect, and to plunge into pure, fast storytelling. Here, barely a sentence, indeed barely a syllable, is wasted. The characterisation is as much as the narrative needs and no more - a couple of facts, physical traits or jokes so that the reader remembers who's who, and then on with the tale.</p> <p>Because Rankin is a master storyteller, that means the reader is quickly swept up and carried along. I read this in one sitting, on a swelteringly hot beach in Greece; I kept meaning to do other things - find a beer, fetch a sunhat, check the BlackBerry - but somehow had to keep putting them off until I finished this chapter; and then the next; until I'd reached the end. </p> <p>By then, I'm glad to report, the genteel Edinburgh of the amateur art thieves had collapsed into a gory spiral of loutish menace, violence and mayhem. It was a good idea to set a story in the Edinburgh art world: it is rich, introverted and hasn't, to my knowledge, been skewered before. Those who know their Scottish painting will enjoy visualising that early 20th-century painter \"Monboddo\" - a bit Cadell, a whiff of Fergusson too - and the works of that lugubrious Victorian portrayer of cold sheep, \"Utterson\". There are jokes about painters as various as Jack Vettriano and Banksy.</p> <p>The final third of the novel is a heart-pounding and relentless rumble as our heroes find their options running out, and the reader wonders, a little late, who the heroes really are. Light social satire gives way to fear and fists. Again, I will give nothing away - except to say that for anyone toying with the idea of crime as a form of boredom therapy, this story is not, on balance, an encouragement. Assuming you're still allowed to smoke in hell, even Rebus will spend a happy hour or two with Doors Open.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrew Marr's most recent book is A History of Modern Britain (Pan)</p>",

  "<p>The Metropolitan police faces its greatest challenge since the Stephen Lawrence inquiry next week with the opening of the inquest into the killing of an innocent man during the July 2005 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>Relatives of Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, who was shot seven times, will be able to question the firearms officers for the first time at a hearing which is expected to put the operational efficiency and leadership of the force under scrutiny.</p> <p>The Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, already under pressure from a race row and questions over the award of a contract to a friend, could be forced to quit early if the result is considered too damaging for him to see out his five-year term. </p> <p>On the eve of the inquest the Met's Black Police Association increased the pressure by announcing it was severing links with managers following the suspension from duty of its national leader, Commander Ali Dizaei. They believe he is the victim of a witch-hunt. </p> <p>Privately few senior figures in the force believe the Met will escape serious criticism following the 12-week inquest at the Oval cricket ground in London. </p> <p>Opening on Monday the hearing will examine all the evidence relating to the events of July 22 2005 when de Menezes was shot by firearms officers who believed he was a suicide bomber. He had just boarded a train at Stockwell tube station when he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head at point blank range.</p> <p>The two firearms officers who shot de Menezes will give evidence behind screens erected to protect their identity from the press and public. However, members of de Menezes's family will be able to see them as they answer questions from their barrister Michael Mansfield QC.</p> <p>Known as C2 and C12, they are among 47 police officers out of a total of 65 who will give evidence from behind screens and remain anonymous. Surveillance officers who followed de Menezes from his flat to the tube station will also be questioned.</p> <p>For the first time members of the public who were on the train carriage at Stockwell and witnessed the shooting will give a public account of what they saw when the surveillance and firearms officers boarded the train and de Menezes was shot. </p> <p>A key witness on the family's side is expected to be Brian Paddick, the former deputy assistant commissioner in the Met, who disputed the commissioner's version of events in the aftermath of the shooting. He subsequently left the force. </p> <p>He is thought to be preparing to tell the inquest of his reservations about the force's shoot to kill policy - Operation Kratos - which allows officers to shoot without warning by firing into the head at point blank range.</p> <p>The most senior officer running the operation on the day, Cressida Dick, who was cleared of any direct blame by the crown court jury, will be closely questioned over her role. Since the shooting she has been promoted to deputy assistant commissioner.</p> <p>De Menezes' mother, Jean, and his brother are travelling from Brazil to be at the hearing, which will be the first full public examination of the events. It will bring the estimated cost of the various inquiries into the shooting to around \u00a32m.</p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission has carried out two inquiries and the Met was found guilty of breaching health and safety laws in a crown court trial last year. The case highlighted a string of errors that resulted in unwarranted risk to the public and de Menezes' death. But no police officer has faced a criminal charge over the killing, something the family has expressed anger about.</p> <p>Relatives still want a public inquiry. In a statement the family said: \"Whilst hopeful about what the inquest may bring, deep-seated concerns remain over how much evidence will be heard in public and what attempts the Metropolitan police will make to keep what happened on 22nd July 2005 secret.\" </p> <p>It added that the police had been granted public interest immunity to keep key documents secret, which was something their lawyers would be challenging. They also questioned why some 50 officers would be giving evidence from behind screens.</p> <p>\"It is very hard to believe that all of these officers need such a high level of protection. Rather it seems the Metropolitan police continue to promote tactics which would ensure that named individuals evade responsibility for the deliberate killing of an innocent man,\" the statement said.</p> <h2>Key players</h2> <p><strong>Cressida Dick</strong> Deputy assistant commissioner.

  "<p>Sex offenders in the Midlands will be required to take lie detector tests to see if they are still a danger to the public, the Ministry of Justice said yesterday.</p> <p>The scheme, which will run as a pilot for three years, will compel sex offenders to answer questions over a 90-minute period, while a polygraph measures changes in breathing, heart activity and sweating, all of which are believed to be related to deception. </p> <p>The results will be used to monitor risk levels and could lead to the recall of offenders who have been released into the community to prison. Information that comes out during the tests cannot be used as evidence in court.</p> <p>The plans are being embraced by groups such as Barnado's, the children's charity, which said it warmly welcomed the government's decision. \"This has the potential significantly to increase public confidence that sex offenders are complying with supervision,\" its chief executive, Martin Narey, said. </p> <p>\"Sex offenders trying to avoid re-offending will be helped by the knowledge that polygraph testing will expose any attempt by them to mislead their probation officer\".</p> <p>Not everyone is so optimistic, not least because of the controversy regarding the tests' reliability. </p> <p>\"The real concern is whether these tests are accurate,\" said Edward Fitzgerald QC, a barrister who has represented numerous sex offenders. \"A lot of the tests devised by psychologists in the past have turned out to be pretty unreliable and lie detector tests are not notorious for their reliability either.\"</p> <p>Lie detector tests were first devised in 1917 by William Marston, a psychologist whose early version was widely criticised for its inaccuracy and was later replaced by more sophisticated versions.</p> <p>Accuracy remains an issue, with the American Polygraph Association estimating 90% to 98% of results to be reliable. </p> <p>There are also questions about the compatibility of lie detectors with fundamental principles in English law. </p> <p>\"There is a right against self-incrimination,\" says Fitzgerald. \"These tests may be relevant in showing if you have breached a condition of your sentence or changed your attitude, but it's massively difficult to prove the negative that you are safe.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice states that the lie detectors will only be used \"as part of an overall assessment as to the risk an offender presents\" and may prompt further investigations. </p> <p>The move towards a compulsory system follows an earlier voluntary pilot, in which fewer than half of those eligible consented to the tests. Of those that were tested, 79% made disclosures that were \"relevant to treatment and supervision\". </p> <p>The Ministry of Justice says the new scheme, which will run in the Midlands, is necessary to establish whether polygraph testing is an effective way of monitoring reoffending risks.</p>",
  "<p>WEN-DEEEEEE!\" chant Pharrell and Madonna before Wendy Melvoin's funky breakdown kicks in on She's Not Me, the standout track from Madge's recent album. It's an echo of Prince's call for \"Little girl Wendy's parade!\" as she riffed into action more than 20 years earlier on His Royal Purpleness's anthem Kiss. From inspiring Prince to make the best music of his career to scoring the TV series Heroes, Wendy and her musical (and former life) partner Lisa Coleman have been darting about the pop culture zeitgeist for three decades. Not that anyone would know.</p> <p>\"For most people, we're the black chicks in lingerie who were in Prince's band,\" quips a very white Lisa, at Henson Recording Studios in LA. Between 1981 and 1986 Wendy &amp; Lisa were key members of his band the Revolution and helped create some of his greatest work (including Purple Rain and Sign O' The Times). While they will be forever etched in people's minds complaining about the thermostat on Purple Rain (the infamous \"Is the water warm enough?\" intro from Computer Blue), theirs is a secret history that takes in the Beach Boys, Linda Blair and Trevor Horn. </p> <p>Right now, the duo are currently holed up in the studio for an intense session scoring another week's episode of Heroes. </p> <p>\"Wendy and I score in real time,\" the softly spoken Lisa says. \"We write and record at the same time - we have 30-35 minutes of music to do each episode.\"</p> <p>The duo have a lot of creative freedom thanks to their personal relationship with Heroes executive producer Allan Arkush. </p> <p>\"We hit it off immediately,\" says Wendy. \"We were in his office and we were looking at the pictures on his wall. There was a picture of Alan with my brother (Jonathan) who had passed away. It turned out Alan had directed the film Get Crazy which Jonathan was in. It felt like it was meant to be.\"</p> <p>Wendy's brother, who was touring keyboardist for the Smashing Pumpkins, died in 1996 from a heroin overdose. Keen-eyed readers of sleevenotes will have observed that Jonathan also played on Prince's album Around The World In A Day along with assorted members of the Melvoin and Coleman clan. Most famously, Wendy's twin sister Susannah was engaged to Prince in the mid-80s and, it is alleged, he wrote Nothing Compares 2 U during one of their many break-ups. </p> <p>The two families grew up in each other's pockets because Wendy's father Mike Melvoin and Lisa's dad Gary Coleman (no, not that one) were firm friends from the days of being LA session musicians in the 60s and 70s for the likes of Beach Boys, Barbra Streisand and Marvin Gaye. </p> <p>Lisa's first foray into music started young. One band, Waldorf Salad, consisted of a pre-teen Lisa, her sister Cole and brothers David and Jonathan. \"They had a single, Look At The Children. Ai-yi-yi! So cheeseball,\" balks Wendy. </p> <p>Despite being deemed \"too young\" to join Waldorf Salad, Wendy and twin sister Susannah had their own ideas about their musical careers. \"We decided we wanted to be the Doublemint Twins. In the US they had an ad campaign for the gum where they would only hire twins,\" explains Wendy. \"So we went to New York to try and get hired but they thought we were too bohemian, not middle America enough.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lisa continued her teen forays into stardom, with a notable appearance in Sarah T - Portrait Of A Teenage Alcoholic, a movie starring The Exorcist's Linda Blair making the difficult transition from child star to...something else. \"It was B-movie heaven,\" laughs Lisa.</p> <p>A few years later, Lisa joined Prince's band. He was looking for a replacement for Gayle Chapman, who'd left after deciding that a nightly routine of simulating fellatio during Head clashed with her religious beliefs.</p> <p>\"I didn't know what he expected when I joined,\" Lisa admits. \"Prince was so separate from the band.\" Being one of \"Prince's ladies\" she soon realised that her stage costume should consist of lingerie and makeup.</p> <p>\"Prince would get on my case for not dressing right - at home wearing jeans was cool but in Minneapolis it was like 'farm time'.\"</p> <p>By the time she'd sorted out her clothes, Lisa's effete musical tastes had affected Prince's musical melting pot, too. Not only had he written a song for her (the unreleased Lisa), he was taking inspiration from her life. \"I bought this vintage pink Mercury at a car auction,\" she remembers. \"It was so bitching-looking that Prince used to borrow it and dent it, which I'd make him feel bad about. He slept in it one time and came up with Little Red Corvette... even though it was a pink Mercury.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Wendy had sung on the track Free (on the album 1999) \"as a test\" but that's as far it went; he didn't even know she could play guitar. All that changed when the extended Melvoin-Coleman clan went out to Manhattan to spend Christmas with Lisa, on the last leg of the 1999 tour.</p> <p>\"Wendy freeformed on an acoustic and Prince was blown away,\" says Lisa. \"Even Joni Mitchell heard her play some chords once and asked, 'What tuning was that? It was really beautiful.' Wendy's playing has the ability to do that.\" The next day, Prince's normal guitarist Dez Dickerson didn't show up for rehearsals and Wendy ended up soundchecking for him. \"Then the 'Funky Little Wendy' side of her came out and it was just over,\" says Lisa. \"Prince began a love affair with her playing.\" </p> <p>Soon after, she joined Prince's band for $300 a week. By the time of the Purple Rain phenomenon Wendy and Lisa were playing pivotal roles. \"I liked the fact that in the film we were separate to his craziness... which we were,\" Wendy admits. \"But at the end of the film where he plays 'our' song Purple Rain - we didn't have that kind of glory in real life.\"</p> <p>By the time of Parade they had formed a powerful musical and emotional trio, pushing Prince's music into a whole new realm of genius. \"The three of us started quite a love affair,\" admits Lisa. \"We travelled together, we'd spend a lot of time together in Nice while he was shooting Under The Cherry Moon. He trusted us.\"</p> <p>Perhaps this growing closeness to the famously private Prince was one of the reasons that he disbanded the Revolution at the height of their powers. Despite guest appearances on Prince's recent albums and a \"reunion\" of sorts at the Brits in 2006, their relationship is complicated.</p> <p>\"The three of us really had a special relationship and it's unbreakable,\" says Lisa. \"I really love him. He's like a brother to me. We did things that only happen in your dreams, they were some of the best times of my life. He's such a talented person, so creative.\"</p> <p>However, Wendy remains sanguine. The duo performed at The Family Jamm!, a charity concert in 2003 which saw performances from a reunited Revolution and other Prince acolytes like Shelia E, The Family, Apollonia and Chaka Khan. There was one notable absentee, however.</p> <p>\"Everybody from the Purple Rain tour was there, something like 365 people, including the truck and bus drivers,\" Wendy says with a mix of sadness, disbelief and anger. \"Prince was the only one that didn't show up. And it's just a bummer that he has to make that kind of line in the sand. He doesn't realise that he's missing out on a tremendous amount of good feeling. He sold himself short and I reserve the right to think he was entirely wrong for doing it.\"</p> <p>Wendy and Lisa released three solo albums in the late-80s and early-90s. They were critical successes but their label, Virgin, didn't know what to do with them. \"I think we were a bit too intellectual for them,\" says Wendy. An abortive album with perfectionist producer Trevor Horn followed (\"During the playback, he'd fall asleep on the console. It was not a good sign\"). </p> <p>Their forthcoming album White Flags Of Winter Chimneys was recorded when Heroes was on hiatus during the Hollywood writers' strike. Wendy describes it as \"their best work\" and the atmospheric Balloon and Beatlesy Invisible suggest an epicness only hinted at previously. There's also a supergroup album with ?uestlove from the Roots and Erykah Badu, a song they've written for the new Family album and a possible musical. \"Our friend Jill Sobule did the original version of I Kissed A Girl and we've done a piss-take version in answer to Katy Perry,\" says Lisa. \"We might do a whole musical together.\" </p> <p>Prince may have disappeared from the scene but it's good to know that Wendy and Lisa are continuing his good work.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> White Flags Of Winter Chimneys is out in Oct.

  "<p>So much for the Football Association's Respect programme, introduced this season to encourage referees and team captains to work together. Mark Halsey was shown scant respect this week following his dismissal of John Terry, the Chelsea captain, last Saturday for serious foul play. Not only was Terry's red card rescinded on appeal but Halsey has wound up refereeing tomorrow's League Two fixture between Chester and Shrewsbury.</p> <p>Normally there would be nothing wrong with a Premier League official occasionally taking a game on the other side of the tracks, but even if Keith Hackett, the referees' boss, did not, as Sir Alex Ferguson claimed, demote Halsey because he refused to change his decision, the authority of all refs has still been seriously undermined.</p> <p>The Professional Game Match Officials Board, which Hackett heads, insists that he had no part in Terry being let off and able to play for Chelsea against Manchester United tomorrow. But either way the case has raised a number of issues, among them the fact that Chelsea turned up with a Queen's Counsel to argue their case. Some time ago Fifa issued a general warning against football going to law to settle its disputes yet it appears that a referee's decision, far from being final, can now be challenged not just by players and managers but m'learned friends. Before long fans will be chanting \"Who's the wanker in the wig?\"</p> <p>With Terry it all boiled down to Halsey's view of what constituted serious foul play as opposed to the so-called professional foul - a misnomer if ever there was one since the offences are often amateurish in the extreme. At Eastlands last Saturday Jo, Manchester City's Brazilian striker, broke clear just over the halfway line only to be brought down by Terry first sticking out a leg and then grabbing him around the waist.</p> <p>Halsey gave Terry a straight red card and to a man the old pros on the TV panels declared it a dud call because, with Ricardo Carvalho in a position to intercept Jo, not to mention the distance the City man was from the opposing goal, a clear scoring opportunity had not been prevented. One grizzled sage did harbour the thought that Halsey \"might have considered it unsportsmanlike\" but otherwise the point was missed by several miles.</p> <p>Most referees would have merely booked Terry but Halsey's insistence that he was guilty of serious foul play suggested that he was punishing the Chelsea man for the cynicism of the challenge, a decision he was entitled to make. The Brigade of Guards could have been waiting to stop Jo and Terry would still have gone off. As it is the FA's disciplinarians, given an opportunity to stand up for an attempt to retain a shred of decency in the way football is now played, have blown it big time.</p> <p>True, football has never been a sport for purists. Even one of its founding fathers, Lord Kinnaird no less, pleaded for hacking to be retained when the first laws were formalised. Yet if such a thing as the spirit of the game still exists Terry's foul on Jo offended it. His action in grabbing the Brazilian with an arm recalled Roy McFarland seizing Grzegorz Lato by the shoulders when he began to sprint clear during England's World Cup qualifier against Poland at Wembley in 1973. \"There was nothing else he could do,\" the pundits protested. Yes there was, he needn't have done it.</p> <p>Serious foul play should not be solely about the sort of tackle Newcastle's Danny Guthrie made on Craig Fagan of Hull City last weekend which left the latter with a broken leg. It should embrace offences totally alien to the fundamentals of the game. In the early 1950s John Arlott described the reaction of Eddie Baily, a cockney artist in Arthur Rowe's push-and-run Tottenham, to Wolves' Johnny Hancocks being cynically brought down by a Yugoslav during an England game. \"Baily dashed across the field in indignant outcry,\" Arlott wrote. \"The offence was not committed against him personally but it was an offence against good football.\"</p> <p>Had Halsey's decision stood Terry would now be starting a three-match ban while ruing his challenge on Jo. As it is he has virtually been given licence to do the same thing again should the need arise. Why bother about the referee when you can count on a QC?</p>",
  "<p>The mother of three, who gives her name just as Beatrice, still doesn't know who raped her all those months ago. They were three men with beer on their breath, iron bars in their hands and Robert Mugabe on their T-shirts.</p> <p>But she has known all along who she holds responsible even though there was nothing she could do about it. Until now. \"They told me they raped me because this is war and I was the enemy. I was just a woman who wanted to vote. There is a Zanu-PF bigwig here in Epworth. I was raped by the militia at his house. There were other women and men they were beating. They were terrorising us because we were against Mugabe,\" she said. \"They did this to us because they thought we couldn't touch them. Now we will touch them. Things have changed in Zimbabwe. They will arrest that bigwig before too long because of what he did to me.\"</p> <p>It will take some time yet to address past wrongs, but a mix of relief and hope - along with a little wishful thinking - swept Zimbabwe this week as millions of people desperate for respite from hunger, an ever more difficult struggle to find the money to survive and the state's terror machine watched Mugabe \"humiliated\", in his own words, into signing a power-sharing deal with his arch foe, Morgan Tsvangirai. </p> <p>People said the deal was far from perfect. Many wanted Mugabe out altogether. There is still the grappling over who gets what in the cabinet. But there was also a sense that when Mugabe signed the agreement he was consigning himself to history. </p> <p>The new sense of freedom and expectation exerted itself in small but telling ways. A day after the political agreement a soldier was headed to the front of the long queue that ran out of a Harare bank of people waiting to withdraw their daily limit of banknotes worth just 50p. Soldiers and war veterans always pushed to the head of the line, and no one ever said anything. But this week voices piped up. \"Get to the back,\" they told the soldier. And he went. </p> <p>Others have reported a profound change in the attitude of the police who have started protecting Tsvangirai's supporters from attack in some areas. Hope has even infected the black market with the Zimbabwe dollar strengthening, and falling prices for goods in short supply such as sugar. Senior civil servants have made it known to Tsvangirai that they await his ministers with enthusiasm.</p> <p>The first exercise of this tentative freedom was led by Tsvangirai's supporters outside the hall where the agreement was signed. Thousands pitched up in Movement for Democratic Change party T-shirts, giving the MDC's open-handed salute, in the shadow of the Zanu-PF headquarters yards from where Mugabe's militia broke up a Tsvangirai rally and beat supporters in June. </p> <p>At the signing of the power-sharing deal, the MDC supporters far outnumbered those there to back Mugabe. Zanu-PF activists looked sullen, as though aware that somehow they had lost out but were not quite sure how. As the MDC activists revelled, Mugabe's supporters grew more agitated and the rocks started flying. </p> <p>The celebrations in the townships around Harare went on late into the night on Monday. In Chitungwiza, an opposition stronghold to the south of the capital, there was excited talk of an end to the misery of hyperinflation - running above 50m percent - and the prospect of jobs returning along with western aid.</p> <p>Others, including thousands of people beaten so badly by Mugabe's militia and soldiers they were left with permanent injuries and others whose homes were destroyed during the state-orchestrated terror against opposition voters, are looking for justice. </p> <p>Beatrice lives in Epworth, a township near Harare terrorised by the Zanu-PF militia as a punishment for turfing out the party's local MP in the parliamentary election and voting overwhelmingly against Mugabe. For weeks, men armed with knives and sling shots ruled the streets, forcing people to long political meetings where suspected opposition supporters were beaten and sometimes murdered. Known MDC activists were abducted and held prisoner at the house of the Zanu-PF district chairman, Teddy Garakara, where they were tortured. Some of the women were raped, whipped and urinated on.</p> <p>Others had their homes razed. Among those targeted was an MDC local councillor, William Mapfumo. The mob beat his wife, who was pregnant, and assaulted their four year-old son. Then they destroyed their home. </p> <p>Zanu-PF's militia bases are gone but it was not until this week that Epworth's residents dared to hope that the terror is over. Among those they accuse of coordinating the violence is Amos Midzi, a former cabinet minister and MP for the area who lost his seat in the March election, and a female Zanu-PF councillor, Joana Mawira, who was also at the scene of the attacks on the women. </p> <p>\"We know who all these people are,\" said Beatrice. \" This is not what Zimbabwe is about. We are not Congo. They must be held to account so that this never happens to my daughter because she wants to exercise her right to vote.\"</p> <p>It remains to be seen if anyone is held to account for the state-orchestrated violence, but if they are, some of the witnesses against them may be the same policemen that Zanu-PF thought were serving its interests. One policeman from Epworth, who is afraid to give his name, said all of the regular officers in his station support the opposition. \"The police did not support this violence. We had to do what we were ordered. The war vets were in charge,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The other day an officer came to us and told us that now we must treat everyone the same. No favours. We know who did what. We were there and saw who was beating and raping. Some of them live here. We have not forgotten.\"</p> <p>Mugabe's opponents are not naive about Zanu-PF. They say that despite the agreement they do not expect tormentors to give up easily. Already negotiations on dividing up the cabinet posts have run into problems because Zanu-PF is insisting on retaining control of all the key ministries with authority over the military, police and finance. </p> <p>But ordinary Zimbabweans also saw something extraordinary this week; their ruler of 28 years, who just a few months ago vowed that only God would remove him from power, was forced into sharing power with a man he despises.</p> <p>That was a tectonic shift and many Zimbabweans now see Mugabe as fatally wounded politically. The president only entered into the agreement because he had no other options. \"Mugabe is the past,\" said Alfred Vava a shop owner in Epworth. \"He is still there but has been forced to recognise Tsvangirai is the future. These old men who have treated us so badly, they didn't care about Zimbabweans. But they are finished.\"</p>",
  "<p>This was one of the most unlikely and satisfying victories Lancashire have enjoyed in their recent history, although they will not know until next weekend whether it was also one of the most significant.</p> <p>They had been on the back foot throughout a game they needed to win to avoid slipping into the relegation zone. They lost the toss and were forced to bat first on a damp pitch on the first afternoon, and despite a more resilient second-innings showing were still rank outsiders when Yasir Arafat cleaned up the last three wickets in the space of 10 balls to leave Kent needing only 163 for victory.</p> <p>But Glen Chapple, Lancashire's one remaining senior seamer following the brave decision to omit Dominic Cork, produced one of the best performances of an admirable county career to provide yet another twist in a topsy-turvy season. Now Kent, for whom victory would have preserved a real chance of winning the title next week, are one point below Lancashire in the table and in the scrap to avoid relegation themselves - while Chapple and his team-mates could be as high as fifth ahead of their last game against Somerset at Taunton, depending on the results in Yorkshire and Durham today.</p> <p>\"It will only be one of my most important performances if we get enough points next week to stay up,\" croaked Chapple, who defied a throat infection to take six for 40 in a sweaty 19-over spell, in the process becoming only the 24th bowler with more than 650 first-class wickets for Lancashire. \"But we'll take some confidence down to Somerset now,\" he continued. \"For a while, we've been at a stage where we just have to fight every day.\"</p> <p>The 34-year-old all-rounder had also contributed with the bat, reaching 45 and sharing a disciplined eighth-wicket stand of 60 with Tom Smith before Arafat completed figures of four for 41.</p> <p>Oliver Newby - preferred to Cork for a fifth start of the year and who had already taken four for 79 in the first innings - then made the early breakthrough that was essential when Kent began their run chase, condemning Joe Denly to a pair by plucking out his off stump with a beauty.</p> <p>But it was Chapple who did the bulk of the damage in reducing them to 38 for five at lunch, dismissing Geraint Jones caught behind and then, crucially, the Kent captain Rob Key who gloved an unplayable lifting leg-cutter. Darren Stevens was brilliantly caught by Stuart Law low to </p> <p>his left at second slip, and Smith, who bowled with impressive control after replacing Newby at the Mersey end, tempted Justin Kemp into a loose drive to backward point.</p> <p>Kent's best remaining hope disappeared when Chapple pinned Martin van Jaarsveld lbw, and Smith took the last two wickets to end with three for 28. \"It's disappointing, but we've witnessed a fine spell of bowling,\" said a gracious Key, who had no complaints about the pitch even though the game lasted only a shade longer than six sessions. \"It was a decent cricket wicket and you could score runs if the bowlers didn't get it right. But I can't remember when Chappy bowled a bad ball.\"</p> <p>He also pointed to the costly concession of 76 extras, which represented almost 20% of the Lancashire's match total.</p>",
  "<h2>Do we need more royal portraits?</h2> <p>The portrait of Princes Margaret by Pietro Annigoni that has just gone on view at the National Portrait Gallery will have at least one fan: my mum. She is also called Margaret, was young in the 1950s when this dates from, and looks like the Queen's pretty sister.</p> <p>I'm sure she and many other people will enjoy seeing this lavish homage, painted two years after Princess Margaret renounced her plans to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend, and giving her the pose of a classical beauty painted by Parmigianino or Ingres.</p> <p>And that's what portraits are about, according to the National Portrait Gallery. Everyone has heroes, or simply celebrities they are interested in - and for a large number of people, in Britain and abroad, members of the royal family come into that category. Sadly, this does not make Annigoni's portrait into a good work of art. There are almost no good works of art in the National Portrait Gallery, anyway - and this isn't going to change that with its pretentious, sentimental and somehow rather creepy simulacrum of the Old Masters. If only the Chapman brothers could get their hands on it. The fact that 2,000 people a day queued to see it at Agnew's Gallery in 1957 just shows you what Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud were up against trying to be great artists in post-war Britain.</p> <p>Annigoni's painting is a reminder of how dismal modern royal portraiture has been. Does this reflect sheer bad taste on the part of the Windsors? Previous British monarchs were portrayed by some great artists: such as Holbein and the anonymous medieval European painter whose wonderful Wilton Diptych shows Richard II saying his prayers. Since the second world war there has only been one commissioned portrait of a British royal that is a masterpiece and that is Freud's brutally realistic portrait of the Queen, isolated and unhappy. Freud proved it is perfectly possible for modern royal portraits to be great art. But course, 99% of royalists would prefer to look at the Annigoni. </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Jones </strong></p> <h2>Do spies make good leaders?</h2> <p>Tzipi Livni, a former agent in Israel's secret foreign service, Mossad, was this week elected the new leader of the country's ruling Kadima party. If she can form a coalition cabinet within six weeks she will become the country's next prime minister, only the second woman to hold the office since the creation of the Israel.</p> <p>What did she do for Mossad? Well, that's classified, of course. It appears that in her mid-20s, Livni, pictured below, had a posting in Paris, where she reportedly kept an eye on one of the agency's safehouses. Wilder suggestions that she was somehow involved in chasing terrorists across Europe have been denied. After a year abroad, she returned to Israel, got married and after two years' service left the agency and became a commercial lawyer.</p> <p>Not a long career as a spy then, though longer than that of George Bush senior, who was Director of Central Intelligence for all of 355 days before he became vice-president and then president of the US; but much shorter than that of Vladimir Putin, who was a KGB officer for well over a decade before becoming president and now prime minister of Russia. Perhaps for each of their constituencies it helped Bush and Putin that they had been involved in clandestine operations. Elsewhere in the world it may not be such a big deal, perhaps even a hindrance to have been deeply immersed in a profession that relies so heavily on dissemblance and trickery. In Israel, however, it's seen slightly differently.</p> <p>Despite Livni's two years with Mossad, the general perception of her is as someone with unusually little military or security experience. She wouldn't be the first Israeli prime minister with a Mossad background - Yitzhak Shamir was in the agency for a decade. But Israel is a country where politicians with a military career behind them still seem to have the edge in public opinion (think of Ariel Sharon, Ehud Barak, Yitzhak Rabin and Menachem Begin). In the end the question could be whether Livni was enough of a spy to succeed as a politician. </p> <p><strong>Rory McCarthy</strong></p> <h2>Should maths be taught differently?</h2> <p>School inspectors this week reported that nearly half of all maths lessons are not good enough. Children, according to the Ofsted report published yesterday, are being drilled to pass exams at the expense of really getting to grips with mathematical concepts. The report said while children may be achieving more maths qualifications, about 10% of secondary school pupils were making inadequate progress in maths and 45% of classes were adequate or worse. Ofsted, which based its findings on 192 primary and secondary schools, warned that today's pupils were leaving school ill-equipped to deal with the numeracy challenges they will face in later life.</p> <p>The findings come in a week when understanding what impact the global stockmarket chaos will have on your own profit and loss account has proved particularly taxing - even for those whose mathematical competence is not in question.</p> <p>So, do we all need to improve our mathematical and financial literacy? </p> <p>Yes we do, according to Tony Gardiner, reader in mathematics and mathematics education at the University of Birmingham. Maths lessons in schools have to be made more challenging in order to turn on a new generation to the appeal of maths. He believes if teachers remain locked into teaching to tests, we are in danger of creating a nation of \"experts in one-piece jigsaws - you don't have to think to practice them\". Until children have the chance to tackle mathematical concepts in greater depth they will continue to turn their backs on the subject. \"That is a tragedy,\" he warns, \"because you end up with people at the Department for Children, Schools and Families who are all English or history graduates who know nothing about maths, who then take decisions about the subject.\" </p> <p><strong>Debbie Andalo</strong></p>",
  "<p>Had Marx and Engels lived to see the day! The counting houses of global finance in freefall, traders going to the wall, and now Washington seemingly intent on nationalising its entire banking sector. As stockmarkets crash around the world, what we are now witnessing is an old-fashioned, full-throttle crisis of capitalism, and no event was more inclined to lift the mood of communism's founding fathers. </p> <p>In the 1850s Friedrich Engels was in Manchester, earning his and Karl Marx's crust working for his father's cotton-thread business, Ermen &amp; Engels. After the failure of the 1848 revolutions, both men had concluded that communism's best chance lay with an economic rupture brought about by capitalism's inherent instability. And from within the very apex of global finance - the mills, counting houses and Royal Exchange of Cottonopolis, as Manchester was known - Engels reported back on the prospects of just such a collapse. As the mid-Victorian economic boom appeared to stumble and a worldwide credit crunch loomed in ways not dissimilar to the current denouement, Engels could not contain his glee. </p> <p>\"Speculation in railways is again reaching dazzling heights - since January 1 most shares have risen by 40%, and the worst ones more than any. \"\u00c7a promet!\" he announced in 1851 of another stockmarket bubble similarly out of control. Capitalism's finale was just around the corner: the railway frenzy was unsustainable, the East India market looked sub-prime while the British cloth industry was being hit by a flood of cheap cotton. </p> <p>\"If the crash in the market coincides with such a gigantic crop, things will be cheery indeed. Peter Ermen is already shitting his pants at the very thought of it, and the little tree-frog's a pretty good barometer,\" Engels wrote of his fearful business partner. Bankruptcies were picking up in London and Liverpool, overproduction was glutting the market, and Engels was adamant the crash would kick in by March 1852. It wasn't to be. Instead exports surged, wages rose, standards of living improved and the mid-Victorian boom ground inexplicably, frustratingly, on. </p> <p>Four years later Engels's optimism returned as the markets faltered. \"This time there'll be a dies irae such as has never been seen before: the whole of Europe's industry in ruins, all markets overstocked ... all the propertied classes in the soup, complete bankruptcy of the bourgeoisie, war and profligacy to the nth degree.\" And at last, he was right: overproduction in the textile markets and an unexpected hike in raw material costs led to a collapse of confidence in the cotton industry, then an HBOS-style run on the banks, and a spate of insolvencies. Like this week's collapsing stockmarkets, the 19th-century global economy shuddered as sugar, coffee, cotton and silk prices plummeted. </p> <p>\"The American crash is superb and not yet over by a long chalk,\" Engels wrote in October 1857. \"The repercussion in England would appear to have begun with the Liverpool Borough Bank. Tant mieux. That means that for the next three or four years, commerce will again be in a bad way. Nous avons maintenant de la chance.\" The conditions for revolution were ripe. With the capitalist mode of production in collapse, the working class would surely rise to the occasion. But two months into the crash the proletariat had still failed to realise its historic calling. \"There are as yet few signs of revolution, for the long period of prosperity has been fearfully demoralising,\" Engels noted gloomily. And by the following spring, business had picked itself up again on the back of new markets in India and China.</p> <p>The final hope lay with the 1860s cotton famine. Then, as now, the crisis of capitalism was US driven, with the civil war leading to a blockade of the south by the north, curtailing cotton exports into Lancashire. Hundreds of thousands of workers were sacked. \"You will readily understand that all the philistines are in a cold sweat,\" Engels reported in 1865 as the Liverpool docks emptied and 125,000 unemployed mill hands wandered the Manchester streets. \"A lot of people in Scotland are finished as well, and one fine day it's bound to be the turn of the banks, and that'd be the end of the matter.\" But it was another false dawn, as the British working class stoically endured further immiseration. By which time Engels had pretty much given up on them. \"The English proletariat's revolutionary energy has completely evaporated,\" he concluded. </p> <p>While few would expect any such militancy from laid-off bankers, what remains of the Marxist movement today is brimming with optimism that the financial crisis sounds the death knell of capitalism. With almost Alistair Darling-like doom, the International Committee of the Fourth International has declared that \"the contradictions within the world capitalist economy are now reaching the point where the type of financial catastrophe and social and economic devastation experienced in the 1930s is not only possible, but is increasingly likely\". </p> <p>I'm not so sure. The uncomfortable truth is that capitalism - assisted by a pliant state - has historically managed to extricate itself from similar crises and emerge ever more virulent. Marx died trying to explain away precisely such incongruities, while Engels chose a different route: building up a remarkable stockmarket portfolio while complaining about tax on his dividends. The final crisis has a little way to go.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tristram Hunt's Penguin biography of Engels is published early next year <a href=\"mailto:tristramhunt@btinternet.com\">tristramhunt@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Coaching a Premiership club, as Dean Ryan discovered early on, is not for everybody. \"You don't have Sundays off, you just have them in a good mood or a bad mood. When you first start, you're shitting yourself about whether you'll still have a job next week. It's all about winning and losing. Then you realise your life is one massive yo-yo and you can't control everything. You have to try and find a steady way through otherwise it's not a lot of fun. You wouldn't be involved in sport if you wanted your life to run methodically.\"</p> <p>A more honest appraisal of the boom-and-bust realities of his profession would be hard to find. That sense of perspective is one of Ryan's more obvious strengths, a partial consequence of the seven years he spent in the army - \"I certainly learned to drink a lot\" - with the Royal Engineers. But even he is starting to fret about his Gloucester side, for whom smooth reliability remains a distant concept. The stumbling home defeat to Leicester and his brutal selectorial response may have been overtaken by a more satisfying first away league victory over Bath but a degree of uncertainty lingers. No one really knows what will unfold when leaders Harlequins visit Kingsholm today.</p> <p>Which, for someone like Ryan, must be torture. His mission is to wean his players off what he calls \"the rollercoaster\" of emotions which has cost them in pressure situations. For the last two seasons Gloucester have topped the table only to be blown away in the play-offs. It comes as no real surprise to learn the 42-year-old did not hang around to celebrate the Bath result. \"I didn't even have a beer. My son was playing rugby at school and I'd promised to pick him up. I'm delighted for the club, the players and myself but I'm not interested in what we did well until it carries on this weekend.\"</p> <p>All of which lends extra significance to today's events. It is Ryan's belief he has nipped in the bud issues which could have festered for months. \"We made a conscious decision that we couldn't keep masking things and pushing the problem to a later date. Sometimes we have won games and things wouldn't get addressed. </p> <p>\"That's been OK while we've been developing but it's not OK any more. Now we're saying we're not going to think about next week until we recognise the problems we've got. If certain players can't solve them we're going to take the team in a different direction. I'd be naive in the extreme to say, 'We won at Bath so everything's all right'. It's not.\"</p> <p>Ryan's record as an uncompromising forward at Saracens, Wasps and Newcastle, let alone during his six years on the Gloucester coaching staff, does not suggest a man content to be an also-ran. He hates having his photograph taken - \"I'm fed up with being made to look like a goblin\" - and spends his spare time cycling up mountains. He rode part of the Tour de France route once again this summer and never shirks a challenge. \"This is probably the toughest job in club rugby, along with Leicester, because of the expectation. That's not something to shy away from, it's something to relish. But you've got to balance development and progress against a group seeking instant gratification. </p> <p>\"It amuses me slightly when suddenly people say my job's in jeopardy. It's a good story, isn't it? But under that logic 11 sides would be changing their head coaches every season. You're always under scrutiny, particularly if I can't come up with the right answers or provide the right direction. It may be we have to take the club out in a different direction this year. </p> <p>\"It may be some decisions we made two to three years ago were not right. But I fail to see why that is automatically linked to changing the management. If the solution is still within the group of people then you find it. The Leicester game probably made life a bit easier. If it had been our fifth game it would have delayed finding the solution. We've won sometimes when Sinbad [James Simpson-Daniel] has done something fantastic and the rest of us have been rubbish. I would see it as a failure if we finished first again and haven't changed.\"</p> <p>In other words, the likes of Ryan Lamb can no longer use youth as a crutch and Olly Barkley's introduction is eagerly awaited. \"You can't say, 'Olly, come and solve all our ills', but I think he'll add something. Some of the new laws are exaggerating the importance of decision-makers in key positions. There is a void of individuals like that.\" </p> <p>Would the next generation benefit like Ryan's father - who was a major in the Royal Corps of Transport - from a spot of national service? \"To make comparisons with the services makes sport look pretty minute. We don't have to do what many of those guys have to do. I always think anyone who would like to be out on active service is a bit strange. The risk of being shot is not something I relish. But in terms of the way people react under pressure there are similarities.\" Has he resorted to any military-based training measures? \"Do I shoot anybody, do you mean? Maybe I should have a gun. That would sharpen everyone up, wouldn't it?\"</p> <p>It is a wonderfully scary mental image. Yet as long as Ryan remains at Kingsholm nothing will distract him from his perennial target. \"Is the failure here because of some of the people involved or something we haven't spotted? We've got to find out. And if we do find it we'll change it. This club is set up to be the best in Europe. If individuals can't deliver I have to come up with something different. Otherwise, quite rightly, I'll come under scrutiny. Just because you've started the journey doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be there at the end.\"</p>",
  "<p>The New York Times reported this week that New York representative <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/washington/19memo.html?scp=5&amp;sq=Charles%20Rangel&amp;st=cse\">Charles Rangel was on the verge of stepping down</a> from his powerful post as chair of the House <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/index.asp\">ways and means committee</a>, due to an ethics scandal. The Democrats even hatched a plan to show that while they know how to keep their own house clean, the Republicans do not. The Times reported: \"Representatives Jerry Lewis of California and Don Young of Alaska were known to be under active criminal investigation while serving earlier as senior Republicans of other committees.\"</p> <p>In the end, Rangel decided, thanks, but no thanks. He liked being chair of the committee too much to give it up merely to help his party. The result is quotes like this one: \"Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat-led Congress officially abandoned their promise to run the most ethical Congress in history and instead embraced the politics of corruption with open arms,\" said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"Any Democrats running for office who refuse to give up Charlie Rangel's tainted cash have officially forfeited the mantle of change they claim to be running on.\"</p> <p>Pelosi, the House speaker, says she sees no reason why Rangel should step down, but should he decide to look carefully, Barack Obama just might. Rangel wrote <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/books/review/Alterman.t.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Charles%20Rangel,%20alterman&amp;st=cse\">a wonderful memoir</a> and has lived a remarkable life, but having served in Congress since 1971, he has come to embody much of what Obama says is wrong with the way things are done in Washington.</p> <p>It's not just that Rangel <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/nyregion/05rangel.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Charles%20Rangel&amp;st=cse\">\"forgot\" to pay his taxes </a>on a vacation home he ownes in the Dominican Republic, while sitting atop the committee that oversees tax laws. It's that he also \"forgot\" to report the rental income at all, and got a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/nyregion/06rangel.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Charles%20Rangel&amp;st=cse\">sweetheart \"no-interest\" loan</a> to buy the property, which happens to come from the kind of splendid foreign beach resort where powerful people go to get away from the rest of us and cut deals the likes of which we would probably not understand. What's more, he did so, sitting amid the splendour of four, count 'em, four splendid rent-controlled apartments - one of which he used as an office - all of which were provided to him by developers who stand to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/nyregion/11rangel.html?scp=8&amp;sq=Charles%20Rangel&amp;st=cse\">benefit from the largesse Rangel dispenses</a> from his committee. If you think such cozy deals have nothing to do with the current real estate and finance crisis, well, you may be right, but I doubt it.</p> <p>I live on the upper, Upper West Side of Manhattan, and while Harlem dominates my district, it fits into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_15th_congressional_district\">the southern-most portion of Rangel's</a>. On primary day last week, I made a special trip to the polling station, even though I had no idea who was running in any of the races, especially to vote for whoever was running in the Democratic primary against Rangel, in order to show my displeasure for what I deem to be the cozy corruption his manner of business represents. </p> <p>Tough luck on me. There was no opponent, as I discovered inside the polling booth. (The nice volunteers asked me just to pick someone to vote for so as not to mess up the machine. But I thought this unfair and walked out.)</p> <p>This leads to another reason I wished to vote against Rangel, even before the New York Times decided to make his questionable ethical arrangements the subject of some serious and salutary investigative journalism. One of the many reasons liberals are so under-represented in Congress is that they choose to be. An unfortunate legacy of what was once badly-needed voting-rights legislation were laws designed to create districts in which racial and ethnic minorities enjoy a majority. Given that many of these representatives have, like Rangel, managed to create districts in which they regularly enjoy victories that garner them more than 80% of votes, the ironic result of their creation is to isolate their voters politically and actually weaken their national representation.</p> <p>While liberals have traditionally supported these laws as a necessity to ensure voting rights for minorities in the south, in many places, they have outlived their usefulness and become an undue burden on the very people they once benefited. \"As populations of solidly Democratic African-Americans are squeezed into fewer and fewer districts,\" notes political scientist David Epstein, \"the surrounding 'bleached' districts have higher chances of electing Republicans.\" His research demonstrates that with the rise of the Republican party's fortunes in the south, the new electoral math dictates that for every extra majority-minority district created, two extra Republicans get elected from surrounding districts. No wonder the Republicans voted so strongly to support the renewal of the Voting Rights Act in 2006, even though as a party they have no elected national minority representatives.</p> <p>So Rangel, giving every appearance of putting himself above the law the rest of us little people must follow, will be a drag on Democratic fortunes in November, and is actually damaging the cause of democracy itself by creating a district in which his election is so certain a matter it requires a person of questionable mental competence merely to contemplate running against him. </p> <p>Cynics might also claim that it would benefit Obama with white working-class voters to distance himself - even denounce so powerful and prominent a black politician, just as Bill Clinton reaped rewards from his famous <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/09/16/sister_souljah_moments/\">Sister Souljah moment</a>. Well, perhaps, but more than that, it would demonstrate the seriousness of his commitment to the kind of change he champions. What's more it would demonstrate the kind of toughness we need in a president and which pundits claim Obama lacks.</p> <p>Rangel stuck with Hillary Clinton throughout the primary season, despite the fact that Harlem is about as Obama-crazy as any neighbourhood in America. A walk down 125th Street reveals more Obama signs in the window than any thoroughfare in the US - at least any I've seen. So a Democratic denunciation of Rangel at the top of the ticket would provide Obama with a \"three-fer\" of good politics, good government and good timing. Political opportunities do not come much richer than that.</p>",
  "<p>Bankers have gone to great lengths to damage our confidence in the banking sector. And loss of confidence and trust on this scale can't be fixed by banning a few <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ceb0cc6-8618-11dd-959e-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1\">short-selling speculators</a> or by nationalising a bank here, an insurance company there. Nor is confidence restored when ministers meet up with bankers on the quiet, and grant them monopoly powers (as with Lloyds). Or when central bankers flood banks with new loans (liquidity) backed by taxpayers. We assume bankers will abuse their monopoly power, and taxpayer-backed loans will not be repaid. That makes us nervous. <br> Above all, we can have little confidence if interest rates remain so high. Banks are cracking under huge debts and liabilities (like the outstanding $60 trillion-plus Credit Default insurance claims hidden away from regulators as \"swaps\"). How can they honour claims and debts if interest rates remain so high?  Oh and by the way, it is really difficult to retain confidence in the system if politicians assure us that interest rates are very low \u2013 contrary to what our own bank statements tell us. Or indeed that low interest rates caused the crisis. It is the deregulation of credit creation in the 1970s that is at the root of this crisis, and it was high, not low interest rates that made today's vast bubble of debt unpayable. Our politicians should catch up.  So how to fix this catastrophic mess and restore confidence?  First we have to think system-wide fixes, not quick fixes. We have to ignore the bleatings of the City, and subordinate all financiers to their proper role as servants of the economy, not masters.  Where do we start? We could begin where Roosevelt did in 1933, and declare a <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=5755\">three-day bank holiday</a>. The Fed, the FSA and the Bank of England could then take time and check the books of banks for well-hidden toxic waste \u2013 undeclared liabilities. Only when regulators have a proper sense of the scale of the mess can they take decisive and appropriate action. Right now they are sloshing buckets of our money about, unsure as to the whereabouts of the financial <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2817995.stm\">\"weapons of mass destruction\"</a> banks have hidden away.<br> Next we must end \"inflation targeting\" \u2013 just a cover for keeping interest rates high. Inflation is falling, not rising, and there is a grave risk of deflation. Think the 1930s, or Japan since 1990. High interest rates are great for lenders/creditors, but a killer for debtors, and there are far more debtors in the economy than savers. And if we are to face the threat of climate change, we need cheap, but not easy, money to help finance a Green New Deal.  Third the Bank of England should regain control over interest rates \u2013 all rates. The interbank lending rate (Libor) should no longer be set by a committee of private bankers meeting daily at the British Bankers Association. They must be set by a committee accountable to society, and, when setting rates, must consider the interests of all who make the economy work \u2013 labour and industry \u2013 not just finance.  These are the fixes needed to deal with systemic threats. We could expect them to restore and retain confidence for as long as they did after Keynes introduced system-wide fixes in the 1930s. That was a golden age of 40 years.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://doxmart.com/landing.aspx\">Doxmart</a></strong> is a interesting mash of an <strong>eBay</strong>-esque distribution system and a publishing network. Fresh out of the blocks at just one month old, the site employs 12 people across offices in Berlin, Milan and sunny Leicester. Managing director <strong>Clive Mendes</strong> says the company started just with investment from the three co-founders but they might be looking for investment in the next few months. Here's how it works.</p> <p><br><em>Doxmart managing director Clive Mendes</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Explain your business to my Mum.</strong><br>\"We are like eBay, but for intellectual property instead of material property. Members of the public or professional publishers - reports, presentations, spreadsheets, videos, music and audio files and even software \u2013 can upload their material, set a price and sell it to others receiving a royalty for each document downloaded.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How does that work?</strong><br>\"You upload from your computer to the Doxmart site using a very simple wizard, adding a title, summary information, keywords and appropriate library categories. When a potential buyer comes along they can find it easily and if it fits the bill, it can be bought and downloaded instantaneously. The money paid is credited to your Doxmart account and you can transfer the earnings to your PayPal account or - coming soon - to your own bank account whenever you wish. And buyers are encouraged to rate the product.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your background?</strong><br>\"My background is in general management and startups primarily in financial services. I set up and ran Royal Insurance one of the first direct insurance companies in Italy and one of the first in the world to sell car insurance online. I have a couple of passions in my working life: one of these is to create efficient and effective companies and the other is to help people achieve their goals. Through Doxmart I hope I'll accomplish both of these things.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How do you make money?</strong><br>\"Doxmart receives a commission of 22% of the net value of each document sold.

  "<p>1O DOWNING STREET <br>LONDON, SW1A 2AA </p> <p>THE PRIME MINISTER </p> <p>Dear colleague, <br> As we head to our conference in Manchester, our focus is upon helping <br>the British people come through this turbulent economic time, and on our defining mission of building a fairer Britain \u2013 winning the fight for Britain's <br>future. <br> <br>This week's international financial turbulence has shown that we are <br>going through a period of extraordinary global change that is taking us <br>into a new world. In this country we will take the tough, decisive action <br>necessary to protect the stability of the economy and to get the financial <br>system moving, as we have done this week and as we did with Northern <br>Rock. <br> <br>Our first task is immediate support for hard-pressed families struggling <br>with the impact of this global financial turbulence. That is why this month <br>we have been helping families with: <br> <br>\u2022 A comprehensive \u00a31 billion housing package that helps first- <br>time buyers; a one-year Stamp Duty holiday for all homes costing <br>under \u00a3175,000; and to help vulnerable homeowners in difficulty, <br>a new mortgage rescue scheme and a more generous safety net <br>to help prevent repossessions. <br> <br>\u2022 Help for families to reduce their energy bills \u2013 not just this <br>winter but permanently \u2013 with a \u00a31 billion increase in our national <br>programme for household energy efficiency. We have pledged to <br>increase: <br>a) the winter fuel payment by \u00a350 to all pensioners (and an <br>extra \u00a3100 for the over 80s) this winter; <br>b) eleven million older and vulnerable people will be eligible for <br>free loft and cavity wall insulation and other energy saving <br>measures that could save them up to \u00a3300 a year in their <br>energy bills. Every household will be eligible to get at least <br>50% off energy saving insulations. <br>c) Cold weather payments for the most vulnerable from \u00a38.50 <br>to \u00a325 a week. <br> <br>And we will encourage people to save an average of \u00a3150 per <br>household on pre-payment meters and \u00a3100 for households on <br>standard credit by switching suppliers and moving to direct debit, <br>in addition to the up to \u00a3300 of savings they can make through <br>energy efficiency measures. To make sure people across the <br>country can take advantage of the help on offer and save as much <br>money as possible, we will run a national TV and press information <br>campaign to publicise what help is available. <br> <br>\u2022 A \u00a3120 family tax cut that begins to come into force this <br>month. <br> <br>And as we face the challenges that change brings, we must restate the <br>case for our party and values. Fairness matters more at a time of <br>profound change such as this. <br> <br>Fair rules, fair chances, and a fair say for everyone: that is the new <br>deal for this new world. <br> <br>Fair rules with our tough measures to punish and prevent crime; with <br>neighbourhood policing a reality in our local communities; the new points <br>based system for immigration and new tougher, but fairer rules for <br>citizenship; and welfare reform so that those who can work, do work. <br> <br>Fair chances by investing in education and skills for all our people; help <br>for older people; and new support for parents to help ease the pressures <br>of bringing up children. <br> <br>And a fair say for all with a new approach to public services to give <br>parents, patients and the public greater control over the services they <br>use; a new wave of NHS reform to make the National Health Service a <br>personal health service; and accelerated schools reform. <br> <br>As we work to build a fairer Britain, we face a Conservative Party that <br>has changed its image, but has not undertaken a serious reappraisal of <br>policy or ideology. They have followed a deliberate strategy of avoiding <br>difficult policy choices but when they do make decisions, we see their <br>instincts still lead them down the road of policies that are unchanged and <br>unfair: <br> <br>\u2022 On tax, their first priority is to divert \u00a31 billion to the 3,000 richest <br>estates in Britain; <br> <br>\u2022 On levels of investment in public services, David Cameron says <br>the differences between Labour and the Tories will be 'dramatic' <br>and 'fundamental'. And they have committed to cuts to Sure Start <br>and to cut \u00a34.5 billion from school building plans; <br> <br>\u2022 And on tackling poverty, they refuse to commit to Labour's target <br>on child poverty and the means by which we are cutting child <br>poverty. <br> <br>I am confident that we can come through this difficult time and meet the <br>challenges we face a stronger, more secure, and fairer country than <br>before. <br> <br>And that we can show people more clearly that the choice at the next <br>election will be between a Conservative Party which still believes in <br>helping the few and not the many; and a Labour Party which believes in <br>fairness and opportunity for all and has the policies to deliver them. <br> <br>Yours sincerely, <br> <br>GORDON BROWN MP</p>",

  "<p>Share prices have soared across the world, with Wall Street rising more than 400 points within minutes of the start of trading in New York, on hopes that the American government will ride to the rescue of the country's distressed banks.</p> <p>The mood was also lifted by a ban this side of the Atlantic on the practice of short-selling and hopes for a rescue of Wall Street's second largest investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>The dramatic rise in the Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA), one of its strongest ever openings, helped push the FTSE 100 index up 431.3 points to 5311.3 by the close.</p> <p>The FTSE 100's dramatic rally represents an 8.84% rise on the day, which has added \u00a3103bn to the value of the index's constituents. This was the index's biggest rise since it was created by the Financial Times and London Stock Exchange in 1984. </p> <p>But the sense of relief, after one of the most turbulent four days in stockmarket history, has not just been felt in London and New York.</p> <p>In France, the CAC-40 index of leading French companies hrose 9.27%, while in Germany the flagship DAX index closed up 5.56%.</p> <p>Europe's rally came after Asian stockmarkets rose overnight following yesterday's rally on Wall Street of over 400 points as news of the government's proposed bailout leaked. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 3.75% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up almost 10%.</p> <p>New York's rally came after news that the US treasury and the country's central bank are putting together a government-sponsored firm - dubbed \"bad bank\" - which would take control of toxic financial assets and clean up the banking system. </p> <p>Traders hope the move will stop the contagion which started with the collapse of Bear Stearns last year and reached a dramatic crescendo this week with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch's shotgun wedding with Bank of America and the bailout of America's largest insurer AIG.</p> <p>Hopes are growing that another troubled bank, Morgan Stanley, could be rescued by a Chinese government-backed investment fund or clinch a deal with rival Wachovia. The China Investment Corp already has a 9.9% stake in Morgan Stanley, which it bought last December, and is in talks to raise that stake to 49%.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley is also locked in talks about a potential merger with America's fourth largest retail bank, Wachovia, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Such a deal would leave Goldman Sachs as the only remaining major independent American investment bank.</p> <p>Rob Carnell at ING Financial Markets said the American government's plan for \"bad bank\" \"is giving equity markets a rare chance to be far more optimistic\". \"What is being talked about is a vehicle for lancing the boil of bad property related assets that is causing banks to stop lending to one another \u2013 and leading to the aggressive shorting that has already claimed some high profile names.\"</p> <p>\"It could draw a line under what has been described by some as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\"</p> <p>The market was also pushed higher by last night's unprecedented move against short-sellers - people who sell shares they do not own on the hopes of pushing the price lower and buying them back at a profit.</p> <p>New rules brought in by the Financial Services Authority which banned new so-called \"short positions\" being taken - or existing positions being increased - in financial services stocks, from midnight last night.</p> <p>Anyone with an existing short position - essentially betting that a stock price will go down - has until next Tuesday to close down that position by buying shares, or they must disclose their positions to the regulator.</p> <p>This rule opens the way to naming and shaming of short-sellers, who as a rule prefer to retain some degree of anonymity, and as a result many have been closing their positions by buying shares in the market this morning, which has helped boost stocks.</p> <p>The Irish financial regulator also banned short positions being taken in Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Irish Life and Permanent or Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p><strong>Triple witching</strong></p> <p>Share prices in London are also being boosted by the scheduled quarterly expiry of a number of futures and options contracts later today - a process known as \"triple witching\".</p> <p>Triple witching takes its name from the residents of the heath in Shakespeare's Macbeth, because it involves three characters that can bring discord.</p> <p>The characters are actually different classes of financial derivative which all come to the end of their trading period at the same time - stock index futures, index options and stock options. Their expiry can greatly increase volatility in the market. In fact it should be called quadruple witching, as the process now includes the expiration of single stock futures as well.</p>",
  "<p>California legislators are to vote today on putting an end to a standoff that has left the state without a budget for nearly three months.</p> <p>After 81 days of failure to reach agreement over how to address the state's $15.2bn shortfall, party leaders and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger came up with an acceptable compromise after just two half-hour meetings yesterday.</p> <p>The agreement builds on a deal worked out between legislators for the two main parties earlier in the week while satisfying the governor's concern that the state's rainy day fund be protected. It also removes a proposal to collect taxes from residents earlier in the financial year.</p> <p>The agreement allows all sides to claim a partial victory, although it dents California's image as the face of \"post-bipartisanship\" in politics.</p> <p>The game of brinksmanship saw Schwarzenegger threaten a veto earlier in the week when Democrats and Republicans first drafted a compromise solution. That prompted a threat from Democrats that they could muster enough votes to counter his veto and return the legislation to his desk.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger then threatened to veto \"hundreds\" of other bills awaiting his approval.</p> <p>But with all sides aware that unseemly negotiations were damaging their credibility with voters, and Democrats mindful that they might not muster sufficient votes to counter the governor's veto, a compromise was reached.</p> <p>Instead of taking early tax payments from residents, the compromise agreement proposes increasing penalties on corporations that underpay taxes. Other elements of the agreement retain proposals agreed on earlier in the week.</p> <p>\"I don't think anybody is celebrating,\" assembly speaker Karen Bass, a Democrat, said. \"I don't believe there will be a happy signing ceremony. But everybody recognises that we need to end 80-plus days of pain in the state of California.\"</p> <p>That pain was real for many as the budget impasse stopped billions of dollars in payments to schools and colleges, healthcare providers and suppliers who do business with the state.</p> <p>But critics argued that the deal merely pushes the problems into the next financial year, an argument that Schwarzenegger had used against the version of the agreement reached at the beginning of the week.</p> <p>\"The reality is, it does nothing for next year except it fails to bring in the real revenue we need to make progress,\" Jean Ross of the California Budget Project told the Sacramento Bee.</p> <p>The roots of the impasse lay in a stark difference between Democrats, Republicans and the governor over how to address California's structural deficit. </p> <p>Democrats wanted to raise taxes on high-income earners, Schwarzenegger proposed a one-cent increase in the sales tax, while Republicans opposed any tax increases and advocated cuts in services.</p> <p>Despite this week's agreement, those differences are likely to persist into next year's budget negotiations.</p>",

  "<p>\"Do you speak English?\" ask the advertisements for a private language school all over the Paris Metro.</p> <p>\"Not yet, but ask me in a year or two,\" might be the answer if the French government has its way.</p> <p>Fearful of losing influence, not to mention business, in an increasingly anglophone world, French children are to be given \"intensive\" extra-curricular English lessons during the school holidays.</p> <p>The country's education minister, Xavier Darcos, said not speaking English was a \"handicap\" and declared this month: \"French youngsters must be bilingual by the time they finish school.\"</p> <p>Darcos said that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, had given him a mission to \"make France a bilingual nation\" and that his proposals redressed a social imbalance.</p> <p>\"Well-off families pay for study sessions abroad. I'm offering them to everyone right here,\" he said.</p> <p>The reform has provoked a mixed reaction in France where previous attempts to make youngsters more fluent in English have largely failed.<br>Eric Charbonnier, an education expert from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, said France had woken up to weaknesses in its language teaching.</p> <p>\"Ten years ago people said France's education system was the best in the world and didn't need to be changed at all,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Now there is a realisation something has to be done because France is falling behind other countries.\"</p> <p>Until now France has seemed more concerned about protecting its own language than promoting another. In 1994 legislation forced radio stations to ensure at least 40% of music output was French and fines were imposed on public bodies using anglicisms.</p> <p>Two years ago in a widely reported public tantrum, the then French president Jacques Chirac stormed out of an EU summit when a French business leader addressed delegates in English. Chirac said he was \"deeply shocked\".</p> <p>Now his successor wants pupils at French lyc\u00e9es \u2014 secondary schools \u2014 to enrol on three weeks of free \"intensive\" courses in English during the February and summer holidays.</p> <p>In addition, all coll\u00e8ges (middle schools) and lyc\u00e9es with low academic achievements have been instructed to offer pupils two hours of extra \"support lessons\" a week including English. The government plans to encourage what it calls \"e-learning\" by offering English courses on the internet.</p> <p>The extra-curricular courses are voluntary and will start in 2010. Lyc\u00e9ens will be invited to apply for places next February. </p> <p>Lessons will concentrate on oral English, a fundamental change as most of France's official examinations are written tests. Classes will be taught by teachers who volunteer to work during the holidays in return for tax-free overtime or by English students from abroad.</p> <p>These holiday English courses are part of a package of education reforms \u2014 including the ending of traditional Saturday lessons in most schools \u2014 announced by Darcos.</p> <p>It is not the first time a French government has tried to close the language gap. In 1989 the education minister, Lionel Jospin, made mandatory two to three hours of English a week for nine- to 11-year-olds. Later legislation introduced 15 minutes a day of English for pupils from six years old.</p> <p>In 2004 a cross-party parliamentary commission recommended \u2014 without success \u2014 that English should be mandatory in all schools and afforded the same importance as the French language and mathematics.<br>Charbonnier believes the new measures stand a better chance of success than previous reforms.</p> <p>\"The world has changed and France has realised it has to change with it. More and more students are spending a year studying in an anglophone country. They realise it looks good on their CV that they can speak English,\" he said.</p>",

But the bottom line is that you know we're always trying our very best to ... oh, what's the point. You get the gist of what we're trying to say.</p> <p>However, there are some days - and we all do it, don't hate us - where we slack off a bit. Take today, for instance. For a start, it's Friday. Second, the Ryder Cup has just started. And third, even though neither of those excuses are necessarily valid, they're good enough for us and that's just the way it's got to be. So imagine our joy when some PR firm or other sent us a story on a plate: film of last night's League Managers' Association soiree, which featured Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger holding court as they both sat slumped on stage in the style of Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.</p> <p>\"This is unprecedented,\" simpered Howard Wilkinson before the event. \"In Hollywood terms, it's the scoop of the year,\" he said, in Fleet Street terms, before finally delivering on his promise with a nod to contemporary cinema: \"It's the first talking picture!\" Sadly, what followed was more of a silent movie with barrelhouse piano, perchance even a zoetrope on a broken stick, because it soon became clear that both Wenger and Ferguson were headlining an evening where cold refreshments were not in short supply. \"If, um, the manager is the most imp ... er ... ortant men at the club ... if not then why do they sack the manager if it does not go well?\" boomed Wenger, stopping just short of repeatedly prodding questionmaster Richard Keys in the chest as he spoke. \"Meh, very good,\" piped up Ferguson, in the manner of a barstool philosopher who has just heard someone finish a repetitive rant about how he doesn't like the look of Gordon Brown's face in the snug.</p> <p>Ferguson was then asked whether his club (\"Manchessted\") or the English national team was the most important thing to him, possibly the most ill-thought-through question posed in the history of human speech. \"Fabio-oooooooooooooo!\" he screamed, pointing at the England manager in the audience. \"A$s his quesshun! Tha$s Fabio's quesshun!\" he added, succinctly suggesting the subject matter was more relevant to Mr Capello. Finally the two managers were asked whether they liked each other. After a painful silence, Ferguson eventually offered some anecdotal evidence, a meal in Geneva where they enjoyed some \"good conversation\". A suggestion that Ferguson only failed to leap across the dinner table in an attempt to throttle Wenger because doing so might have spilt all the wine was never made.</p> <p>The coup de gr\u00e2ce came when, upon being asked by Keys if he and Wenger at least respect each other, Ferguson said that of course they did, before bursting into a fit of schoolgirl giggling and quipping: \"Wait til the next game!\" Upon which the audience roared with sycophantic laughter, a tearful Fiver closed down the movie clip, and turned the TV on in the hope of watching Padraig Harrington riverdancing on Phil Mickelson's pain.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I have to work out whether I go with Evans' ability or Wes' experience\" - Wes Brown might not be particularly flattered, but at least Fergie's judgement hasn't been clouded by the events of last night.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>FANTASY FOOTBALL!

  "<p>Zhang Hong's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/china\">contribution</a> to Cif makes clear the extent of the consumer crisis set off by the large scale <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSSHA33672620080913\">contamination</a> of milk powder in China. At latest count more than 6,000 babies have been affected and four have died. Now reports say that the chemical <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aJk9YS__guLc&amp;refer=asia\">melamine</a> has also been found in drinks and yoghurt sold by major firms in the country's fragmented but fast-growing milk industry.</p> <p>Coming after the rash of food scandals in the People's Republic last year, this presents the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/china.olympics2008\">authorities </a> with the latest in a series of rolling major challenges that have marked what was meant to be a trouble-free Olympics year \u2013 the big freeze in central-southern China in January-February, the riots in Tibet in March, the Sichuan earthquake in May plus a string of natural and man-made disasters.</p> <p>Behind the calamities, there are signs of change in Beijing. Though they hold one-party power, the country's leaders know that they have to respond to popular concerns in ways that were not the case in the first decades of communist rule. </p> <p>The scale of discontent is in no doubt. Official figures report that there were 90,000 protests last year. Some recent demonstrations have shown the scale and volatility that such outbreaks can assume. Ten thousand people gathered to protest at the failure of unauthorised banks in Hunan province this month and a similar-sized crowd gathering in the eastern port of Ningbo outside a factory after a boy was apparently thrown from one of its windows.</p> <p>The protests are single-issue affairs, and do not represent organised opposition to communist rule. Still, for a regime that puts great store in stability, such grassroots sentiment cannot be ignored, particularly when it is prompted by anger against local officials or when it spills over into attacks on government and party offices.</p> <p>After long years in which the official reaction was to cover up anything which went wrong, there are now signs of evolution, at least at the level of central government. The way the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, flew immediately to the scene of the devastating Sichuan earthquake in May and the immediate coverage of the disaster by Chinese media was in stark contrast to past attempts to hide such events, notably in a much worse earthquake in 1976, details of which only emerged years later. This knee-jerk censorship long survived Mao, as shown by the cover-up of the Sars epidemic and the HIV-tainted blood scandal early in this decade.</p> <p>But a combination of new media \u2013 the internet, mobile telephone, SMS \u2013 and some path-blazing journalists and a population that demands a better flow on information is having its effect. While still intent on preserving the traditional control exercised by the Communist party, the central leadership does appear to have realised the need to be more open with information, if only because it is going to spread fast through unofficial channels in any case. That has a potentially important consequence \u2013 the arrival of greater accountability.</p> <p>The process is slow and runs into an immediate roadblock in the shape of local authorities who are not convinced of the virtues of greater openness. As a result, we are seeing a series of trials of strength between Beijing and provincial political and corporate power holders, of which the milk scandal at the <a href=\"http://www.sanlu.com/\">Sanlu</a> group in Hebei province is one.</p> <p>In this case, a New Zealand firm which has a big stake in Sanlu raised the issue with the company in the late spring. Nothing was done. The city government in the capital of Hebei was informed by the company of the problem at the beginning of August. The city officials waited five weeks before telling province-level officials, who then informed Beijing on September 10. </p> <p>The central government ordered a national investigation of milk powder makers, and promptly reported that 10% of baby feed stocks might be contaminated. State television identified three leading brands that had added the chemical melamine to their milk to give false readings of protein content. Eighteen people were arrested, and the mayor of the Hebei capital and the Sanlu general manager have been sacked.</p> <p>This pattern \u2013 of foot-dragging on the spot but of strong action once Beijing is informed \u2013 has been repeated in several other recent cases while senior figures in the capital have also been charged in connection with scams that previously went undisturbed.</p> <p>In Shanxi province in the north, the provincial governor resigned and the vice-governor was sacked this month after liquid from an iron ore deposit pond used by an unauthorised mine flowed into a village through a collapsed wall after heavy rainfall, killing 254 people. </p> <p>The company concerned, which had been bought from state ownership at an auction, had been allowed to get away with not applying for new licenses after its mining and safety permits expired. The Minister of the State Administration of Work Safety, who has been put in charge of the provincial government, acknowledged that the disaster had \"given the administration a bad name\". </p> <p>Senior officials in a city in Yunnan in the southwest have been sacked or disciplined after sending in armed police to back rubber-buyers in a violent dispute with growers \u2013 the buyers were reported to have provided the officials with perks including a luxury jeep.</p> <p>A high-ranking official at the food safety agency is reported to have jumped to his death from a high building a day after being questioned by prosecutors about his financial assets. Last year, the head of the State Food and Drug Administration was shot after being convicted of taking bribes and failing to exercise proper supervision. </p> <p>This is, it may be argued, only touching the tip of an iceberg of corruption. Despite the central government's action over the Shanxi ore slip, China's huge demand for coal means that a campaign to close down small, unsafe mines has been put on hold. So far this month, 48 miners have died in accidents. Collusion between local authorities and small mining operators remains common. In the Shanxi case, local people said the mine owner was \"so rich that he could settle everything with money\".</p> <p>In Sichuan, Wen Jiabao's initial activism gave way to a more defensive crouch by local authorities once he had returned to Beijing. Parents were offered money to stop complaining about the building quality of schools where their children were buried alive in the earthquake. A lawyer who offered them help was sent for one year's hard labour without a trial.</p> <p>Cynics (or realists) would say that this has always been the way in China \u2013 under the 2,200-year empire, magistrates and other officials were expected to live on the \"squeeze\" they extracted from their positions. </p> <p>The republic, which lasted from 1912 to 1949, was notoriously corrupt. The end of Mao's \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_rice_bowl\">iron rice bowl</a>\" that provided housing, education and healthcare (even if of poor quality) and its replacement by a market-driven system has opened up multiple opportunities for graft by those who exercise the authority of the Communist party and authoritarian state.</p> <p>Still, the signs are that something is stirring. The leadership cannot ignore popular sentiment reflected in a nationwide study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which found that 70% of respondents said they thought officials were profiting unfairly from their positions. </p> <p>In part, the party leader and president, Hu Jintao, as a wider political agenda, wanting to exercise central authority over China's provinces and turn back the decentralisation inherent in the economic change introduced by Deng Xiaoping 30 years ago. But the stirrings of grassroots anger over issues ranging from contaminated milk powder to financial scams is not something Hu and his colleagues can ignore in a country which has lost its ideological moorings \u2013 and their need to react can only be for the good.</p>",
  "<p>Standing in the kitchen of a small apartment in outer-suburban Melbourne, Htoo and his wife Gana are reading aloud from an English textbook, helped by their volunteer tutor Narelle. The language is clear and easy to understand, but when they put the book away and sit down to speak about their progress with learning English, things get much more difficult.</p> <p>With the help of a translator, Htoo and Gana explain that they, like thousands of refugees belonging to the Karen ethnic group, fled Burma in 1990. They spent 15 years in a refugee camp on the western border of Thailand, where their daughter was born, before being accepted for resettlement in Australia in 2007. </p> <p>In many ways they are the new face of Australia's long-running Australian Migrant English Programme (Amep) which, 60 years after it was founded, is struggling to deliver functional English to a changing, and swelling, cohort of arrivals. Amep has seen client numbers increase from 37,000 in 2004 to more than 50,000 this year, a third of whom are resettling under the programme's humanitarian stream. </p> <p>This changing demographic has sparked a major review of the Amep programme that will lead to a complete re-tendering for provision of teaching services from 2010. In a discussion paper released in July, the recently renamed Department of Immigration and Citizenship reports that: \"An audit undertaken by Ernst &amp; Young in 2007 noted that the current strategic goal and objectives of the programme do not align.\" </p> <p>Htoo and Gana have completed the standard 510 hours of tuition provided for all non-English-speaking- background (Nesb) migrants, but are clearly having trouble communicating in spoken English. </p> <p>Michelle de Courcy, senior lecturer and postgraduate coordinator for Tesol at the University of Melbourne, said this was a familiar scenario: \"The decoding skills required for reading aloud are relatively easy to acquire, and we often encounter Karen people with very large and complex vocabularies, but not the links required to put them together for interpersonal communication.\" </p> <p>The Amep review discussion paper notes: \"A major criticism of the Amep is a lack of distinction between client groups and a 'one-size-fits-all' approach in providing English tuition.\" </p> <p>De Courcy, who with the Australian Council of Tesol Associations is making a submission to the Amep review, explained: \"The Amep programme may have been appropriate for earlier highly schooled, highly literate cohorts, but you have to look at exactly who is making up the classes \u2014 a good example is the Sudanese migrants arriving in the past few years. You need to look at whether they're from southern Sudan, the Dinka, whose language doesn't really have a written form, or those from the Muslim north who have to be literate in Arabic to be able to read the Koran.\"</p> <p>Another facet of the problem is that the programme has long been promoted as a pathway into employment, despite the fact that 56% of migrants arrive under the \"family\" stream and many of them are too old to work. This is now being addressed in the Amep review, which proposes to create two distinct pathways: \"Settlement for Employment Participation\" and \"Settlement for Social Participation\".</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly for groups such as the Karen, the review discussion paper raised the issue of the number of hours of tuition that will deliver basic functional English. </p> <p>It stated: \"The 510 hours entitlement is not based on any estimate of the time needed to reach proficiency in English. It was derived by averaging the hours that Amep clients spent in the programme irrespective of educational background.\" It also notes that Canada and the UK \"do not cap the number of hours of English language training offered to eligible clients\".</p> <p>The report cites recent research that suggests \"the learning of another language requires on average 1,800 hours\". While this is a laudable objective, such a large and expensive increase in hours for 50,000 migrants a year looks unlikely.</p> <p>Where government funding falls short, charities do their best to bridge the gap. In the case of Htoo and Gana, and the four other adult Karen with whom they share their weekly classes, the charity is The Smith Family, which runs a language programme known as Each One Teach One (Eoto). </p> <p>While the scheme itself is not new \u2014 it was founded in Sydney in 1971 largely to help socially isolated migrant women \u2014 it is now attempting to expand in Melbourne to help refugees falling through the Amep net.</p> <p>Since 2006 it has expanded into five of Melbourne's poorer suburbs, funded through individual and corporate donations and with all tutoring done on a volunteer basis. \"Finding the tutors is the ongoing issue,\" said Eoto coordinator, Lisa Miller, \"though we'll never run out of students.\"</p> <p>In addition to face-to-face tutoring, it links students to English speaking \"mentors\" by phone, sending each a copy of the same book to read aloud during three 20-minute sessions a week. \"One big problem is that they need a landline to call their mentors, which many of them can't afford. Some have mobile phones, but the calls are expensive. That's a huge frustration, because we can achieve so much just for the cost of a phone call,\" said Miller.</p> <p>Eoto volunteer tutors complete a six-week, part-time training course before teaching. Htoo and Gana's teacher Naralle works for an insurance company by day and teaches the Karen group one evening per week. </p> <p>\"Their reading and writing is very good, so I'm going to start to focus more on conversation,\" she said. </p> <p>\"For me, it's about giving something back to the community, but I also get a lot of insight into their culture. I've travelled in south-east Asia and I hope to go and work in the camps my students come from.\"</p>",
  "<p>Is there a way to simplify a complex, multiyear investigation of international financial dealings into an argument that a jury can understand?</p> <p>Proving that the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation is a front group funding terrorists is the goal of federal prosecutors this week. The first trial in 2007, conducted after a 15-year investigation, resulted in a hung jury and a mistrial.</p> <p>This time, prosecutors seem to be intent on presenting a more focused case. They have dropped numerous charges against some of the defendants, while two defendants who led the Muslim charity will face the same charges as in the 2007 trial, conspiring to funnel money to Hamas, designated by the US as a terrorist organisation.</p> <p>\"Not only did HLF operate to support the Hamas agenda, but it was created for that very purpose,\" prosecutors wrote in a recent brief.<br>A gag order prohibits either side from speaking directly to the news media.</p> <p>The federal government shut down the Holy Land Foundation in December 2001, three months after the September 11 attacks.</p> <p>A federal grand jury indicted the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and seven of its principal figures in July 2004 on charges that they provided \"material support\" to Hamas, according to a prosecutors' brief filed on September 12. </p> <p>Shukri Abu-Baker, Ghassan Elashi and others were charged with providing funds and resources to Hamas, including $12.4m (\u00a36.8m) sent abroad to help create an Islamic Palestine by eliminating Israel through \"violent jihad.\"</p> <p>The bulk of the case, however, was financial: allegations of financial transactions with global terrorists, detainees, activists and families of martyrs, money laundering, conspiracy and filing false tax returns, all hidden behind a charitable facade.</p> <p>At the time, US attorney general John Ashcroft said \"The United States will ensure that both terrorists and their financiers meet the same, certain justice.\"</p> <p>The foundation denied ties to Hamas and described the feeding of Palestinians, often restricted by martial law, as a \"moral duty\". In its own words, the foundation \"provided relief to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and occupied Palestine. It also aided other countries including Bosnia, Albania, Chechnya, Turkey and the United States, where its officials were involved in helping victims of Texas tornadoes and the Oklahoma City Bombing. They also provided volunteers and services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. By 2001, its annual budget reached about $14 million.\"</p> <p>The trial began in July 2007 after the federal government invested millions of dollars and numerous years in the investigation. A mountain of evidence was presented. In October, after 19 days of deliberation, Judge A Joe Fish declared a mistrial. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on any count against the foundation and four of its principal individuals.</p> <p>In the case of the other defendant, Mohammed El-Mezain, the jury hung on one count and acquitted on the others.</p> <p>One juror said that the government case was riddled with gaps.<br>Because of the time, money and resources involved, the failure to get guilty verdicts was considered by many to be a stunning setback for the government.</p> <p>On August 29, the government dismissed non-conspiracy counts against two others, Mufid Abdulqader and Abdulrahman Odeh. They will face only conspiracy counts in the new trial. El-Mezain will be retried on a single conspiracy count, while Abu-Baker and Elashi face numerous counts.</p> <p>Jury selection was completed Thursday morning, and opening statements before US district Judge Jorge A Solis are expected on Monday morning.<br></p>",
  "<p>Ali Dizaei was well aware of his notoriety as he joked that he put on his stab vest when he went into Scotland Yard.</p> <p>Flamboyant and controversial, the Iranian-born Muslim bodybuilder has been spied on, bugged, and then wrongly accused and charged - all by his own colleagues.</p> <p>Early on in his career, Dizaei was singled out as one of the Metropolitan police's fastest-rising young officers, tipped to become the first ethnic minority commissioner.</p> <p>He was born in Tehran in 1962 to a family with a long history of police work. His grandfather had been an assistant commissioner, while his father was head of the traffic police and his uncles were also in the force. </p> <p>His father believed that his son needed a British education to succeed and sent him to a boarding school in Sussex. Then he studied law at London's City University.</p> <p>Dizaei joined Thames Valley police in 1986 and in spite of racial harassment in his early years as an officer he found time to study for an MA and then a doctorate.</p> <p>He joined the Metropolitan police as a superintendent in March 1999 - the year it was found guilty of institutional racism after the inquiry into police handling of the murder of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>Dizaei was vice-chairman of the National Black Police Officers Association (NBPA) at the time.</p> <p>But Dizaei was himself secretly suspected of a string of allegations and in 1999 and 2000 became the subject of what was to become the most expensive inquiry into a single officer.</p> <p>Colleagues investigated him under the codename Helios over allegations of corruption, using drugs and prostitutes, and spying for Iran \u2013 all charges which were later dropped. In 2001 he was suspended.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said the investigation cost the taxpayer \u00a32.2m. Dizaei argued the figure was more like \u00a37m.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, later apologised for the inquiry, saying it had caused \"considerable damage\" within the force.</p> <p>During the course of the investigation against Dizaei it emerged that he was intensely disliked by some of his more conservative colleagues who thought his sunglasses and cowboy boots were \"flash\". His self-confessed open marriage, love of designer clothes and nightclubs also attracted adverse attention. </p> <p>In 2003 he was cleared of perverting the course of justice, misconduct in public office and making false expense claims - leading to renewed claims that the Metropolitan police had failed to stamp out racism.</p> <p>Dizaei was reinstated and awarded \u00a360,000 compensation. Speaking after the last of the charges were dropped, Dizaei said he believed there had been a campaign by individuals to \"destroy my life and my career\".</p> <p>But there was more controversy to come.</p> <p>In 2006, he was criticised for attacking the Forest Gate anti-terror raid on two Muslim brothers and for questioning the need for passenger profiling on aircraft.</p> <p>The following year he angered his superiors even more as he singled colleagues out for blame in his Not One Of Us, which told the story of Operation Helios.</p> <p>Earlier this year Dizaei was promoted from chief superintendent to commander, entitling him to join the Association of Chief Police Officers. It was his fourth attempt to become a chief officer.</p> <p>More recently, in his role as president of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, Dizaei has become a close confidante of assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur who is taking the force to an employment tribunal over claims of racial discrimination, and is currently on gardening leave.</p> <p>Dizaei was privy to closely-guarded details of Ghaffur's dossier of alleged racism and discrimination.</p> <p>Reports have said his latest suspension comes amid allegations he advised a defence team on how to undermine a criminal case brought by his employer. He is said to deny the claims completely.</p> <p>Sir Ian Blair was asked if he had confidence in Dizaei at a press briefing earlier this week. He declined to answer.</p>",
  "<p>Metal detectors: you expect to find them at airport security check-ins, rail and tube stations, and maybe the odd open-air festival. But perhaps the last place you expect to encounter one is the middle of a sleepy north London high street.</p> <p>Yet on Wednesday night, some residents of <a href=\"http://www.muswell-hill.com/\">Muswell Hill</a> were introduced to the Met's latest initiative for tackling knife crime \u2013 the \"<a href=\"http://cms.met.police.uk/met/boroughs/haringey/04how_are_we_doing/news/night_time_screening_arch_operation_muswell_hill\">safety/screening arch</a>\". </p> <p>Commuters, shoppers, pub-goers and passersby alike were shepherded through the large, black electronic doorway, set up 100 yards from the main roundabout; while up to eight fluorescent-jacketed community support officers huddled beside it, guarding it like an ancient portal, and forcing any stragglers who dared circumvent it back through.</p> <p>So is this legal? Can you now be forced through a metal detector/stopped and searched while ambling along your local high street?</p> <p>Well, yes and no. </p> <p>If there has been a serious crime in your area, then the police can exercise the powers to stop and search, without reasonable suspicion, see <a href=\"http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/Stop_Search_Explained.pdf?view=Binary;\">section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (pdf)</a>. </p> <p>But without the \"grounds for reasonable suspicion\" and no serious crime, then police, in theory, have no right to stop and search \u2013 although it gets cloudy here \u2013 what exactly is \"reasonable suspicion\"? Also, under the Terrorism Act 2000, police can stop and search/detain anyone they suspect of being involved in terrorist activity.</p> <p>Back to Muswell Hill though, and even police sergeant Paul Davies of Haringey Borough Police, who was in charge of Wednesday night's initiative, admits that his PCSOs don't have the right to corral passersby through the detector, but says that his officers rely on \"community cooperation\".</p> <p>According to Davies, the safety arch was not yet another symbol (along with <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/crimeprevention/cctv.htm\">CCTV</a> cameras) of our Usain Bolt-like sprint towards a police state, but was instead \"a deterrent and about making people safe\"; he cited several examples of mothers thanking him for doing something in the area, which he claims is a magnet for low-level crime.</p> <p>Davies says he has used the arch four times on Muswell Hill Broadway so far. And, although approximately 400 people were scanned on Wednesday, the detector's bleepers have yet to signal the presence of a knife on this or on any of the other occasions.</p> <p>He also points out the educational value of the initiative \u2013 two squad cars, parked near to the arch, have their back seats set up like lounges, with mini-TVs playing videos explaining the consequences of carrying a knife to any young people who may be, say, reluctant to be scanned.</p> <p>It seems odd that a fairly wealthy, middle-class area has been used to trial the safety arch, but with the sad news that a 26th teenager, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7614934.stm\">Oliver King Onzila</a> has been murdered on London's streets this year so far (most of the 26 murders in the capital have been as a result of knife crime), surely such preventative measures are to be welcomed?</p> <p><em>Yvonne Singh is a Comment subeditor who lives in London</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Washington DC. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Sid Barcelona, Jon \"JonH\" Horvath, Rob Myers, Steve \"Raskal\" Raskin. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Robert Elms, a broadcaster on BBC Radio London, likes to signal the arrival of the weekend by loosening his tie and throwing off his shoes for a segment on his show he likes to call \"funky Friday\". Now, despite a personal aversion to fun that stems back to a childhood incident involving a particularly malevolent clown and a plastic whistle, we can't help feeling that Fort Knox Five would be ideal for this strand on Elms's programme. On their debut album Radio Free DC they've mixed up ragga, hip-hop from circa \"back in the day\", gritty funk, commercial disco, old soul, sweaty jazz and a dash of indie rock (it's distributed by Fugazi's label Dischord in the US and features Ian Svenonius of DC hardcore bands Nation of Ulysses and the Make Up on some tracks) to create a non-stop party, er, jam, or do we mean joint? Anyway, it's a veritable hands-in-the-air dance-fest of a record that puts the \"fun\" into \"funky\", the \"aargh!\" into \"R&amp;B\" and the \"oi!\" into \"blaxploitation\". Sorry, we're just getting that Friday feeling. <br> Fort Knox Five aren't just musicians and performers, they're also producers and remixers, only they don't call it remixing, they call it \"reminting\". We have no idea why that might be, but it suggests a healthily wayward imagination and desire to play with convention. Either that or they can't spell. Still, their services have been employed recently by artists as varied as Afrika Bambaataa, Tito Puente, Louis Armstrong and Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers, only some of whom are still alive, not that you can tell from their remints \u2013 yuk, sounds like a packet of masticated Polos \u2013 because everything Fort Knox Five touch spills over with brio, zest and other cleaning liquids. One artist who is very much alive \u2013 we just checked with her husband, Gavin Rossdale, a close personal friend \u2013 is Gwen Stefani, who invited the band to join her on her Harajuku Lovers tour with Black Eyed Peas, another living, breathing outfit whose song My Humps sometimes makes us wish they were dead. FKF are fairly bursting with life. Imagine if Public Enemy were a go-go-band, if Sly &amp; the Family Stone made an album with Prince Paul at the controls, if Curtis Mayfield joined forces with a Bomb Squad stoned on 70s reefer, if Afrika Bambaataa had managed to coax one final tour of studio duty out of Norman Whitfield (RIP). Hopefully, these fanciful notions will give you some idea of what to expect from Radio Free DC, of the blend of electronic and live instrumentation, of the samples and sax parps, the crisp beats and psych-soul guitar licks, the calls to \"git up!\" and \"keep the funk real\". Fort Knox Five like their catchphrases. They've got one, \"Funk 4 Peace!\", that expresses their lightly humorous, gently critical sociopolitical worldview \u2013 McCain and Obama won't exactly be running for cover, but at least they're having a go. Most of the time, though, these doobie brothers' satire is of the Cheech &amp; Chong variety \u2013 one of their songs is called Papa Was Stoned. Actually, that's quite funny. Well, it is Friday. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"It's thoroughly 70s, with funky retro beats that give the album a nice feel.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Like Plastic Little, they're derivative and unoriginal, the samples predictable, but they do purvey a nice line in rapped-up funkadelia. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Fight for the right to party. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Party for the right to fight.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Radio Free DC is released by Fort Knox Recordings on November 10.

  "<p>There is an unseemly irony in the weapon of choice seized by the Labour Party mutineers: the request for <a href=\"http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2008/09/19/nomination-paper-plotters-branded-as-sdp-style-wreckers/\">leadership election nomination papers</a>.</p> <p>This is allowed in the rules laid down in 1994, when Labour's restructuring was designed to modernise inner-party democracy, calm the ideological tumults of the 1980s and, most importantly, to secure the leader's position. </p> <p>After year zero when New Labour took over Downing Street, party commissar Margaret McDonagh quelled any stray demands for elections or debates. The party lost the habit. </p> <p>McDonagh has moved on, into business, and the irony is that her sister Siobhan has now put up her hand and claimed the neglected right to request leadership election nomination papers. Her manoeuvre would have been scythed by the commissar but, she now apparently benefited from her sister's advice. <br> The irony is compounded by the volunteers who have joined her, Joan Ryan and Janet Anderson, like her, hyper-loyalists, and the yesterday's men from the Blair court, Clarke, Milburn et al. </p> <p>That this is, as used to be said, a rightist plot, is signified by the dramatis personae who are cheekily digging up a democratic bone that their tendency buried in the party's back garden, which silenced the dangerous \"deep and far-reaching debate\" that Joan Ryan says she wants. </p> <p>The last time there was one of those was in 2000 when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/labour/945323.stm\">the party defeated the leadership over pensions</a>, and the public employees' leader, the stalwart Rodney Bickerstaffe, lamented: \"Are they saying delegates can never tell the leadership what they think? All we wanted to do was show that we believed in something.\"<br> The mutineers aren't all card-carrying members of the New Labour neoliberal wing, they include some of the left's \"usual suspects\" and others left gasping at the incompetence on Downing Street. </p> <p>Their grumblings of exasperation have grown into a howl by the hopeless mismanagement of the so-called relaunch, and the evidence that Gordon Brown's cleansing of Downing Street has resulted not in no spin but no nothing. </p> <p>And yet this mutiny is oddly slow. It is not igniting MPs, nor the party \u2013 what's left of it. Nor is it engaging the trade unions or the Compass network, who have begun to develop a progressive social democratic prospectus within Labourism. </p> <p>They have every reason to despair of Gordon Brown, they might have been expected to join in, but they're not. For them the candidate isn't the point. Even now that capitalism's unregulated excesses are bringing the world economy to a scary brink, the expectation that a Labour government might do something to discipline the market is unrequited. </p> <p>Where are the signs that the putative candidates, wrinkly Jack Straw or sweet David Miliband, will dare to tread where Brown himself will not, and call capitalism to account? Everyone is talking about it, everyone is worried or frightened. But there is no sound from them, they are not seizing the zeitgeist. The economic tsunami and the unhappiness of our society ache for the healing powers of social justice and the confidence to exercise a bit \u2013 just a bit \u2013 of control over the unacceptable face of capitalism.<br> So, for the first time since the violent split over the Iraq war, progressive, left-of-centre social democrats have some space in which to move and some bargaining power inside the Labour Party \u2013 not because of their numbers but their ideas. For the first time Brown really needs them. </p> <p>The plotters may lose this battle, but this only the first bout in what will become a long game to oust Brown. They might not win. But neither will he.</p> <p>Miliband may not know it yet, but he, too, needs to rediscover progressive politics. Miliband is probably right that Tony Blair left too late for Brown and too early for Miliband's generation. But that is also beside the point. </p> <p>The regime that fashioned the succession as a coronation, blessed by divine rather than democratic wisdom, also closed down the conditions in which the new generation might make itself a new identity. </p> <p>Miliband's peers are going to have to do it for themselves \u2013 but they can't do it by themselves; and if David Cameron doesn't think he can win an election by steering to the right, why would they?</p>",
  "<p>The decision by the Metropolitan Police to diversify its area of operations to include comedy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/14/police.race\">soap opera</a> appears to be a recent one. No policy decision to go this way appears to have been made in any public arena. And yet it is by peering through the windows at Sir Ian Blair's strife-torn Scotland Yard that many on the right appear to be getting their entertainment these days. Suddenly the crippling police precept seems good value.</p> <p>But behind most good comedy is tragedy and the current scenario at the Met is no different. Here is a <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/about/blair.htm\">commissioner</a> with many of the right instincts beset by never-ending controversy \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12270982\">de Menezes</a>, a corruption inquiry, high-profile gun and knife crime \u2013 now facing what looks like mutiny from his own senior colleagues \u2013 many of them the very cadre of minority officers that he professed a desire to help. </p> <p>Much of the comedy value comes from the fact that so many officers are taking the Met and Blair \u2013 now branded as the very epitome of the politically correct public official \u2013 to court alleging racial discrimination. Serves you right for pandering to these people, is how the right see it. </p> <p>And the best comedy is indeed built upon a simple premise. But what been happening at the Met isn't that simple. Some of the protagonists have genuine grievances, others have personal animosities or \"form\" with each other, soured histories and memories of slights that go back years. There are the rivalries and unachieved ambitions that characterise any large organisation. Policing, like politics, is a tough old game.</p> <p>It takes strong leadership to keep an organisation like the Met stable and functional and if there is a common thread discernable in the Met's patchwork of calamities it is that the necessary leadership has been lacking.</p> <p>Blair has never had much control of his force. He is neither loved nor feared. This manifested itself most graphically on the day of the de Menezes shooting when, by his account, no one bothered to tell him that the Met had shot the wrong man. But it also goes some way to explaining why his minority officers are now making so much trouble for him. He, more than any commissioner we have known, was expected to usher in radical changes which might give them the careers they thought they deserved, but at the end of the day he hasn't delivered. The suspensions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/police.race?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=uknews\">Tarique Ghaffur</a>, an assistant commissioner, and now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/19/police.race1\">Ali Dizaei</a>, a commander, would not necessarily resonate with ordinary rank and file minority officers were it not for the fact that they too feel Blair has fallen short. There is precious little racist banter in the canteens these days, for society has changed and so has the Met, but still they feel they are denied promotions and subjected excessively to the disciplinary procedures. They join, they leave; they vote with their feet.</p> <p>None of this can be attributed to bad intentions on the part of Blair, but the Met is a notoriously difficult place to run and he has never quite been able \u2013 through the hard power of his office or the soft power of personal charisma \u2013 to place his stamp on it. Perhaps only the prime minister knows how he feels.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of the country's brightest pupils are missing out on tailored teaching because their schools are failing to take part in a programme catering for gifted children.</p> <p>Ministers have written to every headteacher in England this week urging them to do more to spot pupils with particular talents in subjects ranging from science and maths to sports and music, after they discovered that a quarter of primary schools have failed to take part in the compulsory \"gifted and talented\" programme.</p> <p>Lord Adonis, the schools minister, has urged parents to demand more attention from teachers if they feel their children have a particular talent. </p> <p>Speaking at a conference at Brunel University today he said national records show that schools have identified 780,000 pupils with a particular aptitude in a subject, but still a quarter of primary schools and 6% of secondaries are not recording any pupils under the programme. </p> <p>This year's test results for 11-year-olds revealed a fall in the number of pupils getting top marks, fuelling concerns that the most able pupils are being neglected as schools fight to raise overall pass marks which feed into national targets.</p> <p>Ofsted today criticises primaries for failing to sport pupils with a particular aptitude for mathematics.<br> Adonis said that it is \"unacceptable\" that some schools haven't identified a single gifted and talented pupil. </p> <p>\"A child whose confidence and interest in education is destroyed when they are young risks having them destroyed for life. Equally, a child whose interest is sparked could receive the push they need to go on and really achieve great things.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Nearly all secondary schools are now identifying gifted and talented pupils - but there is still work to do at primary school level. Our goal is a simple but challenging one: every primary and secondary school must have a rigorous system in place for the identification and support of gifted and talented pupils. </p> <p>\"Primary schools especially must now ensure they have a proper programme for gifted and talented children. Teachers should be actively identifying the most promising students \u2013 regardless of background \u2013 and nurturing their talents, whether they be academic, artistic or sporting.\"</p> <p>Parents, he said, should demand more from their schools if they feel their child's talents are going unrecognised. </p> <p>Pupils identified under the gifted and talented programme qualify for extra teaching and support in their particular subject. They also get access to an online learner academy. </p> <p>Secondary schools have a dedicated gifted and talented co-ordinator, while clusters of primary schools share co-ordinators to set up classes and extra-curricular programmes. </p> <p>In sport, they may get extra football lessons; in academic subjects they may get weekend classes or be fast-tracked to GCSEs. </p> <p>Officials at the Department for Children Schools and Families define gifted and talented as \"those who have one or more abilities developed to a level significantly ahead of their year group (or with the potential to develop these abilities)\".</p> <p>Generally, \"gifted\" means the top 10% of the school population in academic subjects and \"talented\" the top 10% in other subjects.<br></p>",

The film co-stars Catherine Keener, Michelle Williams, Samantha Morton and Jennifer Jason-Leigh.</p> <p>It is Kaufman's style to blur fantasy and reality to create a wry, silly sort of humour. And yet his films aways seem, paradoxically, to produce something surreally beautiful that continues to echo in the mind long after the end credits have rolled. The new film is said to ramp this aesthetic up to extremes. Some critics have found it overwhelming, but I suspect that if you already like his movies, this one will be like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61kHpmenkT8\">Bart's hallucinogenic experience</a> in the episode of The Simpsons where he demands Apu turns up the syrup dial on his slushy machine.</p> <p>Synecdoche, New York is screening at the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/lff/\">London film festival</a> on October 28.

  "<p>With midfielder Cristiano Ronaldo seemingly back to full fitness, the Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, has admitted he is facing a selection dilemma ahead of his side's Premier League encounter with Chelsea on Sunday, saying: \"I just hope I pick the right team\".</p> <p>Ronaldo came on as a second-half substitute in United's goalless Champions League draw against Villarreal on Wednesday and Ferguson has admitted that the Portuguese international is pressing hard for a start against Luiz Felipe Scolari's men at Stamford Bridge, with his side looking for its first win in four matches.</p> <p>\"He's [Ronaldo] a natural athlete,\" Ferguson told the club's official website. \"He's trained very well and I'd have no problems at all playing him on Sunday. I just have to decide if it's the right time. I think he did very well on Wednesday night. He was aggressive in his running and was a good threat. The boy wants to play \u2013 he's been in my ear the whole time. I just hope I pick the right team.\"</p> <p>The United manager threw new signing Dimitar Berbatov straight into the fray in the 2-1 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield, but although the former Tottenham striker set up Carlos Tevez's opening strike after just three minutes Berbatov faded from view thereafter, as he struggled to forge an understanding with his new team-mates. Berbatov did not feature against Villarreal after picking up a knee injury at Anfield but he will be available for selection for the Chelsea match, as will Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Nani and, apparently, Ronaldo.</p> <p>Manchester United's only enforced absentees on Sunday will be Michael Carrick (ankle) and Nemanja Vidic (suspended) and he is eager to return to winning ways against title rivals Chelsea after losing to Zenit St Petersburg, in the Uefa Super Cup, Liverpool and the draw with Villarreal. \"When you play against the big four it's important you get a big points-haul out of them,\" he added. \"Last season we did very well against the top four. This season we've lost the first one already. We can't afford to lose another one.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ferguson has again waded into the debate surrounding the decision to overturn John Terry's recent red card, believing that the FA have \"opened a gate\". </p> <p>The Manchester United manager's initial reaction when he discovered Terry would be free to face his side at Stamford Bridge on Sunday was to scold referees' chief Keith Hackett for his perceived involvement.</p> <p>Ferguson is still not entirely happy about the situation, especially as Nemanja Vidic misses out this weekend following his dismissal at Liverpool, forcing him into a major decision about who plays alongside Rio Ferdinand.</p> <p>The Scot accepts by the actual definition of a professional foul, Terry should not have walked. However, in over-ruling referee Mark Halsey, Ferguson feels the FA are setting a dangerous precedent.</p> <p>\"Chelsea have used the FA panel well,\" reflected Ferguson.</p> <p>\"There was a cynicism about Terry's challenge but by the letter of the law it was not a goalscoring opportunity. That is how the FA have decided it and it is maybe good to have an FA panel people can go to. But it certainly opens the gate to that kind of thing now.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's 4am in the morning. You're lying awake in the worry hour. You know that, even if there was nothing to fret about, your brain would come up with something. But this time, the anxieties are thundering past, like delayed trains chasing the clock.<br> Can I trust the bank to look after my money? Clickety clack. How much has my house fallen in value? Clickety clack. Will high fuel prices mean I can't keep my car on the road? Can I afford to buy enough food for the family? Clickety clack. Will I lose my job, and why is everyone making me paranoid about climate change when there's nothing I can do about it? Clickety, clickety clack \u2026 and then back to the beginning. The \"triple crunch\" of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">credit-fuelled financial crisis</a>, accelerating <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/\">climate change</a> and soaring <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/more-big-increases-in-energy-prices-913311.html\">energy prices</a> \u2013 how did we get into this mess? In the face of so many simultaneous crises, we all have legitimate questions for the governments that allowed us to sleepwalk into this situation. <br> These are no longer abstract, distant issues of financial and environmental policy. They are beginning to affect everyone.  A general sense of having our livelihoods and wellbeing neglected by the people elected to govern us can easily tip over into an understandable sense of outrage and having been betrayed. Down these highly charged tracks lie the possibility for both progressive and poisonous political trains of thought to emerge.  For that reason, we must be quick to spell out how peoples' genuine concerns and fears can become a force for change that is necessary in economic and environmental terms, and socially progressive. But how can we make sure that the junction box switches the emotional tracks to progress, rather than a poisonous reaction? We talk about the issues straight on, using the language with which people experience them.  First, if you're sitting there feeling angry and worried, good, you should be. Things are out of control. With very few rules, the banks have played fast and loose with their lending, making some individuals very rich in the process. But often the money they lend you has been created out of thin air with nothing real to anchor it, by \u2013 in effect \u2013 an accounting trick. This has made the value of things like your home very volatile \u2013 rising and falling \u2013 making it hard to plan your life \u2026 The answer is that we need many more checks and balances to curb such damaging instability, to protect the value of your assets and make it easier to plan your life.</p> <p>Next, our leaders and big businesses have been reckless in failing to plan for the end of the oil age. As global demand goes up and supply can't match it, the price is permanently high and on a long-term rising trend. The cost of warming your home and travelling around will keep going up.<br> But, it's not too late. Massive efforts to increase renewable energy, conserve what's left, and find more fuel-efficient ways to get around and grow food, will give us security, meet our needs and, very possibly, give us better quality of life. Food seems expensive (although in reality we're spending less on it now than we did decades ago), but as long as farming stays heavily dependent on oil to grow and transport what we eat, it will remain so. Yet, if we grow not all, but more food locally and use less oil to do so, we can curb future food-bill rises. We can also bring bills down by preparing more of our own food, and cutting down on costly packaging and pre-prepared food. As oil starts to run out, in the UK and all over the world, there will have to be a shift away from large-scale, oil and gas-guzzling farming, to smaller, lower-input or organic farms. There's no easy dodge for the last issue, and just like when a doctor is nervous about giving a full prognosis, the patients, all of us, have a right to know the truth. Climate change is real and dangerous. The trigger for potentially irreversible, runaway effects is just around the corner, as little as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">99 months away</a> and counting.<br> But, unlike some big global political issues against which we all feel powerless, like cold wars and hot wars, as far as climate change is concerned, we can all do something. Instead of feeling helpless, there is a new importance to our lives. Everything we do from now on really matters. We must lead by example \u2013 for instance by changing our energy supplier to a renewable one, using less and changing how we travel.  And we mustn't let our governments off the hook. It's not tenable for the prime minister to say he's concerned about the impact of climate change on Britain and the world's poorest, and then allow new runways and <a href=\"http://www.eon-uk.com/generation/kingsnorth.aspx\">coal-fired power stations</a>. Instead of trying to derail clean energy targets in Europe, the government should be implementing plans for dramatic decarbonisation of the electricity supply, reduced energy use in buildings, an increase in renewables on the scale needed, and a huge expansion of clean reliable, public transport. <br> If Britain leads by example too, then the rest of the world, countries like India and China, may just follow. They certainly won't if we don't. The stakes couldn't be higher, but this is something that everyone can do. The answer to many of these problems is investing in a massive environmental transformation programme amounting to a <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/greennewdealneededforuk210708.aspx\">green new deal</a>. It is a comprehensive programme designed to stabilise the economy, create jobs, tackle poverty and inequality and help protect us from the vulnerable supply lines of the global food and energy markets.<br> The rules of the game are designed by policy-makers and they can be changed. So far, the voting public has been horrendously let down. Now, we all have a chance to speak up and get on the train for positive change. If we do so, we'll probably even sleep better at night.</p> <p><em>On Friday September 19 a <a href=\"www.neweconomics.org\">new economics foundation</a>/Guardian event will discuss 'Triple crunch: Can we solve the credit crunch, climate change and energy price shocks with a Green New Deal?'

  "<p>All things considered in the current financial crisis you'd expect more from the left about the collapse of capitalism and the opportunities this presents for socialism and other forms of collective activity. My fear is the chief outcome may not be the doubtful benefits of nationalisation, but nationalism.</p> <p>From what I've read, in Wednesday's Guardian G2 for instance, the left response is muted and uncertain, rather than jubilant. Try as I may I can't get it out of my mind that the collapse is a rather more lethal, self-inflicted version of what al Qaida tried on 9/11. The financial sector just bombed itself.</p> <p>Caution on the left stems partly from an awareness that a lot of ordinary people are getting hurt as the buildings tumble on Wall St and in the City. \"It's the flower sellers and the hairdressers, as well as the bankers losing their jobs,\" a friend reminded me last night.</p> <p>And, of course, it all arises against a familiar, enduring background: the loss of confidence arising from the collapse of Soviet communism, the morphing of China into a form of market Stalinism and beyond, the retreat of social democratic models as capital reasserted itself in most developed states.</p> <p>In such an apocalyptic mood all sorts of odd things happen. The Daily Mail rails against <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1056800/Spivs-sharks-champagne-corks-popping-Meltdown-Monday.html\">\"City spivs\" who \"go short\" on share prices </a>and help destroy the value of otherwise sound firms (the government's ban has been widely welcomed today). And the Open Democracy website <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/the-end-of-american-capitalism\">posts an FT article by Willem Buiter</a>, LSE prof and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee under an \"end of capitalism as we know it\" headline.</p> <p>Maybe. But as others point out, the philosopher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/recession.labour\">Michael Onfray in G2</a> for instance, capitalism has a great adaptability. When delegates at the TUC recommended a return to widespread nationalisation \u2013 \"it's even back in America\" \u2013 they didn't find a strong echo. </p> <p>After the Great Depression and World War II \u2013 when more of the British economy was centrally controlled than Hitler's and to better effect \u2013 many people concluded that state ownership of strategic industries would prove more efficient. I used to think so myself. But in normal conditions, not a war crisis, it doesn't fit human behaviour patterns quite so well. </p> <p>So in George Bush's Washington, it's a sensible but temporary response to an extraordinary collapse, predictable though it was to many people who suspended disbelief. Markets rallied sharply today after Washington wrote its blank cheque to mop up banks bad debts. Have we touched bottom? Not necessarily, the market lemmings stick together on the way down as well as up. </p> <p>Either way capitalism will be back, soberer than it has been for 20 years \u2013 until the next crisis comes along. Hopefully, it will be better regulated and less arrogant. Remember just how ignorant about real life \u2013 and their own worth \u2013 City bankers showed themselves to be when interviewed for Polly Toynbee and David Walker's new book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/04/workandcareers.executivesalaries\">Unjust Rewards</a>. It seems a long time ago now \u2013 but it wasn't.</p> <p>Most of the technical proposals for shutting assorted stables doors now that they've fallen off are above my pay grade. The Guardian had a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/economy.marketturmoil\">good leader </a>this morning, but rightwing media is also chastened as the dominoes fall. It would be nice to think the balance of forces in society will be re-tilted more in favour of labour \u2013 the workers by hand and by brain, as the old Clause IV phrase put it \u2013 and away from the demands of unfettered markets. Babies and bathwater come to mind.</p> <p>What intrigues me is how it will all play out in the longer term. For instance, when HBOS is folded into Lloyds TSB and Scotland finally loses one of its two great banks, how does that play among Scots voters eyeing the SNP government in Edinburgh? The Union of 1707 arose in part from the collapse of the Scottish banking system in the wake of the failed colonisation at Darien in Panama. </p> <p>Could a banking crisis also trigger the end of the same Union? Or will voters, who know that Scotland's financial services industries have done almost as well as England's inside the Union, look nervously at events and stick with Britain? Impossible to say, but it's worth asking. Alex Salmond is already doing his best to offload the blame down south. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are both Edinburgh politicians too, as Halifax has just been forced to notice.</p> <p>Ditto Britain's relationship with the European Central Bank, the eurozone. Will we end up inside the safety of the larger monetary pool when it's all over? Or will the merits of going it alone be re-asserted by the bumpy ride now underway. A lot rides on the performance of the Treasury, Bank of England and FSA, the Brown-created tripartite system which started the crisis badly \u2013 Britain usually does - but may yet be seen to have had a good war.</p> <p>The biggest question of all is the damage done to the United States and to its model of capitalism for the past 30 years. Over drinks last night several friends, old enough to be old lefties, instinctively argued that Bush II - Iraq and Guantanamo, not to mention Hurricane Katrina - had finished off American soft power \u2013 as an admired global model - and that the Wall St crash is now finishing its hard power. It can't afford global hegemonic ambitions any more.</p> <p>As usual I retain more faith in the recuperative powers of the United States, though as usual I think it's pushing its luck. A presidential win for Barack Obama would reassure the wider world that the US is set to mend its ways \u2013 though there's no guarantee he can actually address necessary change. The McCain/Palin ticket would have a harder job \u2013 though you can never tell there either. Nor can we yet be sure which candidate will benefit from the financial crisis. On paper it should be Obama (McCain made an over-optimistic gaffe on the economy this week), but voters may go counter-intuitive.</p> <p>The real shift here surely is one of power - from west to east and south. China, India and other major developing countries which have ambiguous feelings towards Europe and the US, both its economic and political models, will be quietly sitting back and enjoying it. Some Asian sovereign funds which have lost money holding dollars or US shares will seek to recoup losses and exploit American weakness by buying up companies in any passing fire sale.</p> <p>Great states rise and fall, sometimes very quickly on a few important mistakes. China was already in highly nationalistic mood. To that we may now add righteous indignation. Have we just witnessed a tipping point?</p>",
  "<p>Shiver me timbers! It's international <a href=\"http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html\">Talk Like A Pirate Day</a>! So I shall, at least briefly ...</p> <p><em>Arrrhh - that looks like a French ship carrying some cargo. Let's climb on board, shoot someone just to prove we're serious, and then hold the ship's crew and cargo to ransom. It would have worked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/18/shipping.piracy\">the other week with that French couple on their yacht</a> if the damned French special forces hadn't appeared with their damned parachutes. Damn their eyes! Our lads got shot and arrested!</em></p> <p>Was that too close to the bone, perhaps? Were you hoping for something a bit more, I don't know, like Captain Jack Sparrow of Pirates of the Caribbean? Sorry to disappoint. People do have a tendency to romanticise this stuff, to make it sound less threatening. Perhaps that's because the reality of facing someone who hasn't eaten in a week, is waving a gun and sees you as their lunch ticket isn't one we like to think about.</p> <p>Similarly with piracy in the world of computing. There's a lot of romanticism about it. It's harmless! Nobody gets hurt, really. It's all Jack Sparrow dancing about on a ship's deck, killing zombies.</p> <p>Sadly not true. Piracy of DVDs and CDs is linked to organised crime. But unlike the pirates on the high seas, who in both their modern and antiquated forms are ruthless and implacable, you can reason with the people who thrive on online piracy. They're the potential buyers of the items. If people didn't grab stuff that the pirates have put up there, there'd be no point in piracy.</p> <p>That's why it was so impressive to see Cliff Harris <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/11/games.piracy1\">engage honestly with the people who pirate his games</a> and try to find out what they really wanted, and what would make them lay down their figurative arms.</p> <p>Harris discovered that the twin barriers of price and digital rights management (DRM) are the biggest incentive to make and share illicit copies. So he lowered those barriers.</p> <p>It's going to be very interesting, therefore, to see what Electronic Arts does with Spore. It has been a huge hit; but it has also annoyed lots of people because it insists that you connect to the internet to validate it, and it insists that you can only install it three times.</p> <p>As a result, it has rapidly become one of the most pirated games ever. Arr-harr me hearties! It <a href=\"http://www.torrentfreak.com/spore-most-pirated-game-ever-thanks-to-drm-080913/\">sat at the top of the rankings on The Pirate Bay for more than a week</a>. Even if TorrentFreak is wrong by a little distance in its suggestion of 500,000 downloads, the amount of licensing cash that EA has missed out on is ... well, it's somewhere between zero and millions of dollars, because not everyone would have bought the game. </p> <p>One can understand EA's thinking, from a corporate viewpoint: \"Spore cost a lot of money to write; it has cost a lot of money to make. Writing a game for a PC or Mac isn't like writing for a console, where pirating a disc is rather more challenging. So let's stop people copying it and sharing it among their friends.\" (That sighing noise you hear is music industry executives wishing they'd done this from the start with CDs.)</p> <p>But while critics love Spore (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/04/pc.games\">Steve Boxer's review</a>: it's one of those rare 5/5 ravers), buyers hate it. Or rather, hate the DRM. More than 2,000 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B000FKBCX4/ref=dp_db_cm_cr_acr_txt?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1\">reviews on Amazon</a> gave it one star because of the DRM. Of course, if you download it from BitTorrent, it won't have the DRM.</p> <p>As Greg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/sep/18/games?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=technology\">asks on the Gamesblog</a>, \"Why should legitimate customers receive a worse user experience than someone who has downloaded it from a torrent?\"</p> <p>It's the core question, and one that the games companies are wrestling with as seriously as the music and film industries have been doing for years now. </p> <p>Some people will think there are easy answers. EA should have written truncated versions of the game, and seeded those onto the filesharing networks: versions that would let you rise only so far up the evolutionary chain of the game, and then stop; versions that would limit you to only one \"creature\"; versions that would simply not have the full functionality in key ways. (Hell, Adobe has been doing this \u2013 and selling it \u2013 as a way of curtailing Photoshop piracy through its Photoshop Elements product, which is a \"cheap enough, good enough\" version of Photoshop for most people.)</p> <p>That can sound like a solution, but I suspect it's a bit glib. Creating all those extra versions is hard work and it could all be upset by just one person being determined and smart enough to break through the full-blown game's DRM \u2013 which is guaranteed to happen, because there are enough people who like the intellectual challenge of doing it, and one is bound to succeed and put it online for the bragging rights among his peers. </p> <p>Don't think that EA will necessarily follow Harris, either. Lowering prices and dropping DRM are hard to justify to a board that's publicly accountable to its shareholders. EA might just think that the game isn't worth the candle, and focus instead on games that only appear on particular consoles. </p> <p>It might even move to a different model altogether, where you play the game on its servers (World of Spore Warcraft?) or download it piece by piece \u2013 the equivalent, in our piracy metaphor, of sending cargo by rocket or helicopter. Or it could follow the lead of Valve, which is rumoured to be in Google's sights, and offer you in-game adverts. How would you like your evolution to a new form, or your boss stage fight, to be interrupted by these \"important messages\"?</p> <p>As one commenter on Greg's post says, \"I think we should go back to the system of 'Go to page 8 in your manual, skim down to paragraph 4, line 3 and type in the word second from last'.\" It did at least have the merit of simplicity.</p>",
  "<p>These days being Conservative is almost achingly cool. This was apparent to anyone at the launch party for <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk\">GQ</a> editor Dylan Jones's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cameron-Conversations-Dylan-Jones/dp/0007285361\">book</a> about David Cameron the other day where I saw fashionista power-worshippers schmoozing with shadow cabinet ministers. Not that I report this in a spirit of undiluted triumphalism. It actually made me feel slightly queasy.</p> <p>Anyway, cast your mind back a few years and you can probably remember when being Conservative was not cool at all. The main celebrity backers the party had were night club boss <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stringfellow\">Peter Stringfellow</a> and comedian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Davidson_(comedian)\">Jim Davidson</a> - and jolly grateful it was to have them.</p> <p>Any qualms about associating the Tory brand with lap dancing or racist jokes were cast aside in those dark days \u2013 out of appreciation that any celebrities were willing to offer support.</p> <p>So the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7615733.stm\">news</a> that Tory representatives attending next month's party conference in Birmingham, including MPs, have been given discount vouchers for a lap dancing club, reads like a throwback. The vouchers, offering a \u00a310 reduction on entry to Birmingham's <a href=\"http://www.therocketclub.com/\">Rocket Club</a>, were in a booklet sent out to delegates with official conference literature, it is just yards from the International Convention Centre. The Rocket Club describes itself as \"an exclusive gentlemen's entertainment venue\".</p> <p>The association with the Rocket Club was not, of course, a purposeful Cameroonian initiative but an unforeseen consequence of the party applying its principles on privatisation. A Birmingham marketing agency had been tasked with sorting out the vouchers booklet.</p> <p>Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe, the former shadow home secretary, told the Sunday Express: \"I can hardly believe this is true. I know the Conservative party is supposed to be modernising but do we have to throw every value out of the window? Can you imagine what our old ladies are going to make of it if they turn up there by mistake?\" </p> <p>Of course, Widdecombe has got it completely wrong. I have never been to the Rocket Club but my guess is that is not a haunt for the young, trendy or exotic but for for seedy, middle aged Brummie businessmen.</p> <p>Or seedy, middle aged non-Brummie businessmen visiting the International Convention Centre safe in the knowledge that their wives are many miles away and wishing to gain some dull, conventional, rather traditional, form of titillation. Cheaper, less risky and less guilt-inducing than engaging the services of a prostitute. Just a bit of fun, they tell themselves.</p> <p>Certainly it is embarrassing for the Conservative party to be associated with such a venture, however tenuous and accidental the association. But I'm not sure charges of hypocrisy stick. In July the Conservatives called for changes in the licensing law to make opening new lap dancing clubs harder. There are more than 300 of them and at present they are treated in the same category as coffee shops which does seem curious.</p> <p>Yet it is, as they say, a free country. There seems to be no serious call to ban them. Were they banned then no doubt they would operate underground, greatly boosting organised crime. Some may be revolted by the idea of them but then others might be revolted by gay nightclubs (which should not be banned either).</p> <p>All that should happen is that the control of leaflets sent out with the party conference handbook should be taken back in-house next year. It was a privatisation too far.</p>",
  "<p>There's always a price for success. For Julius Caesar it was a backstreet spinal tap, for a post-Croatia Theo Walcott it's the sour breath of a thousand hulking full-backs on his neck and for the Stereophonics it was, well, you've heard Just Enough Education To Perform, right? But the fans of QPR - currently fourth in the Championship - can put an exact figure on their stroll up the table: \u00a340 for a home game against Derby. </p> <p>Not too long ago, of course, QPR's supporters would have been happy to hear they'd still be paying to watch their team play anybody. Hoops fans had endured the humiliation of their side going from a team that often played the beautiful game at its most erotic \u2013 they finished fifth in the top flight in the early 90s too \u2013 to a side of League One also-rans. The fun didn't end there though; the club had a \u00a310m loan they'd taken out from a mysterious Panamanian conglomerate hanging over its bowed head, was involved in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spHjQ69EfYs\">a mass brawl with the nation of China</a>, while the then chairman Gianni Paladini claimed he had a gun pulled on him by a fellow director (the allegation was thrown out in court). To top it all off the board even sunk so low as to appoint John Gregory manager. </p> <p>But last year, with QPR just hours from administration, they were snapped up by Formula One supremos Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, who were later joined by Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, a man so rich he could probably buy a 0.32% share in Man City. Rather than Ridsdale-it-up, though, the new owners have invested in the club sensibly, paying off debts renovating the ground and bringing in good players on free transfers. </p> <p>Last season was one of consolidation. Gregory departed in November and was replaced by Luigi Di Canio who got the team playing attractive football again. Unfortunately, he forgot to tell them to defend and they gave away leads again and again. This season, Iain Dowie has kept Di Canio's attacking ethos, but tightened up at the back \u2013 at Norwich on Wednesday QPR played 65 minutes with 10 men and still came away with a win. </p> <p>So with the club doing well on and off the pitch, it's galling for many fans that ticket prices have been hiked. And it's happened more than once. \"In the summer we were told season ticket prices would be going up by 10%,\" says Clive Whittingham of <a href=\"http://www.clubfanzine.com/QPR/\">Loft for Words</a>. \"Many of the rises ended up being closer to 100%.\" This was compounded when prices for the Derby game went up too \u2013 a change that's set to be permanent for games against bigger sides (whether a side who set a host of new lows last season is a top club is an argument for another day). There's a bewildering array of tickets for games at Loftus Rd: Platinum, Silver, Bronze - chintzy names for what is essentially a plastic seat - but what it comes down to is that a good seat that cost \u00a330 last week will now set you back \u00a340. </p> <p>\"We feel like we're not being told the whole truth and we're being ripped off,\" says Whittingham. \"\u00a340 is ridiculously poor value to watch Championship football.\" </p> <p>Derby County agree, and the Football League will rule today whether the price changes are fair. \"We have stuck by our guns. We don't think it is fair to increase those prices,\" said Matt McCann, the Rams' head of communications. </p> <p>According to QPR \"the board has considered it a necessity to increase match-day prices to maintain budgets previously set. We are totally committed to building a sound financial base for the future.\" They also point out that you can get tickets for as little as \u00a320, although many fans will point out that you might not be able to see one of the goals from your seat. </p> <p>And then there's Briatore's sometimes baffling quotes, which bring in to question whether he thinks he's running a football club or a swish hotel. \"Step by step we have been putting money into facilities so as to create a unique brand and concept; in essence a boutique stadium,\" he said earlier this season. \"It is an exclusive side of football that will rely on service, style, the ability to look after people and an insistence on playing the game the right way. It is all part of our plan, and we must make sure we do things the right way.\"</p> <p>It's a shame that it's come to this \u2013 despite Rangers' encouraging start to the season crowds have only passed 15,000 once, and price rises are likely have something to do with that - especially as Whittingham acknowledges that the vast majority of fans are grateful for what the new owners have done for them. It just seems very little reward for a set of fans that have stuck with their club through thin, thinner and gossamer.</p>",
  "<p>Go ahead and laugh, wise guy. You may think this makes no sense as an answer to question about retention of US domestic oil:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Oil and coal? Of course, it's a fungible commodity and they don't flag, you know, the molecules, where it's going and where it's not. But in the sense of the Congress today, they know that there are very, very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first,\" Palin said. \"So, I believe that what Congress is going to do, also, is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it's Americans that get stuck to holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here, pumped here. It's got to flow into our domestic markets first.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But when it comes out of the mouth of the person who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-nelson/mccain-thinks-palin-knows_b_125830.html\">knows more about energy than anyone in the United States</a>, I say you better listen pal. Molecule flagging is a very serious, insidious, hidden issue in America today. And not just in the realm of energy. Small-town librarians who permit books about gays on the shelves, for example; can't it fairly be said that their molecules have flagged beyond the point of redemption?</p> <p>Hilzoy spends <a href=\"http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/09/energy-expertis.html\">two paragraphs</a> trying to take Palin's statement seriously, and it fares no better under that generous light:</p> <blockquote> <p>But let's pretend this is a serious statement, and consider it seriously. Who do we presently export oil to? Well: in 2007, the two main recipients of our oil were Mexico and Canada, who between them received some 170,716,000 barrels of what the Energy Information Administration calls \"petroleum and products.\" That's nearly a third of our exports. But guess what? When you look at the analogous table of imports, who turns up in first and second place? Canada and Mexico again! They sold us 1,455,280,000 barrels between them in 2007, or about eight and a half times as much as we sold them. If you check crude oil alone, it turns out that all our exports in 2007 went to Canada, which was also our number one supplier, selling us nearly seventy times as much crude oil as we sold the Canadians.</p> <p>Do you think that they would keep on selling us all that oil if we unilaterally stopped selling oil to them? Maybe they would, and maybe they wouldn't. Do you think Sarah Palin knows the answer? I hope so. It would be pretty strange for the nation's foremost expert on energy to come out in favor of an embargo without knowing whether or not it would cost us nearly 1.3 billion barrels of \"petroleum and products\" a day year (oops), including about 19% of our total crude oil imports. Annoying our neighbors so much that they cut off our oil supplies would, I suppose, be one way of helping us achieve energy independence, but it doesn't seem like a particularly good idea.</p> </blockquote> <p>But of course Palin is America's leading energy authority.<br></p>",
  "<p>I do not want an arranged marriage. I do not want to even get married. But I am Asian, female and second-generation British. I have a partner and we live together. And yes, he has met my father and all of my extended family. My father has met his parents. And they share a work ethic, an understanding of Britain, and of world events that means learning about each other's cultural background only enriches all our lives to a deeper level. You see, my partner and his family are not Asian; they are from the UK, and they are white.</p> <p>Last Saturday writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/13/family1\">Ziauddin Sardar</a> rolled out the familiar manifesto extolling the virtues of arranged marriages as a means of keeping community values alive. The piece revealed some deep prejudices that can't be left unchallenged.</p> <p>First, the tone is of teaching a lesson in social studies to a mysterious other: the \"you\" addressed is \"people in Britain\", specifically, white people, whose family life is in a \"state\". (First complaint; Asian people live in Britain, are part of British society and read the Saturday Guardian too.) The writer implies that non-Asian, non-arranged marriages end in divorce, and that in white culture, adolescents binge drink, form gangs and perpetrate violence. Not so, the writer tries to argue, in Asian culture which has extended families and arranged marriages to keep people moral. Again, sorry to state the obvious, but British Asian teenagers binge drink too. They get in fights and they belong to gangs, but they probably don't tell their parents</p> <p>They also don't tell if they snog each other or lose their virginity ignobly in the middle of the day in their mate's university room because their dad is picking them up from college before it gets dark. In fact, many Asian young people live a double life to an unhealthy extent, lying to the point of living in a state of denial, not because they don't honour their parents, but because honesty about who you are and what you are doing takes second place to traditional Asian society's perceptions of what is right and proper behaviour. It's a hypocrisy that hides everything from the odd bottle of WKD on a night out, right down to secret abortions. Asian extended families, for all their virtues, perpetrate this culture of silence to a minute degree, because the behaviour of each person in the structure represents the moral probity of the whole.</p> <p>So while you might get support from everyone when you do what they think is right, you risk losing a lot if you reject the standard. The divorce rate might indeed be lower in arranged marriages, but its not because they \"work\" as Sardar puts it, its also because people are brought up to believe they shouldn't divorce even if they are emotionally, intellectually and physically, unfulfilled within the union.</p> <p>The second problem with the piece was that the dirty history of arranged marriages was covered up. Traditionally women were bought and sold as commodities, to increase the wealth and mutual benefit of each family involved. From her father's house to her husband's parents' house, the younger and more able to bear (male) children, the better. </p> <p>Some things may be different now; rather than trying to gain loyalty by association, or new plot of land in exchange for a daughter, for the Asian diaspora, arranging marriage is motivated by fear. A deep fear that language, culture and traditions will die and family bonds will break. But this fear is essentially fear of the \"other\"; it is evident in many refugee or immigrant cultures worldwide. It is enshrined in the tenets of some religions that you cannot marry \"out\" without losing your identity. It's a way of keeping things \"pure\" and it's a lesson that stalks young British Asians from childhood.</p> <p>Because, as is well documented in many cultures, women are the traditional custodians of patriarchal ideals in families. Using powerful, ancient stories that contain implicit warnings, they protect and pass on concepts such as purity to their children, especially girls. So it's disingenuous to argue that because women are the \"practitioners\" of the ancient art of arranging marriages it is therefore not a misogynistic tradition. </p> <p>Is it too much to hope that bringing up young people to be aware of their culture and traditions but able to make choices without pressure from any group in society, might mean they keep the best of their heritage, enrich it with diverse influences, and jettison the rest? Sardar's research into \"<a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/display.asp?K=9781862079311&amp;aub=Ziauddin%20Sardar&amp;m=28&amp;dc=37\">Balti Britain</a>\" seems to suggest this is thankfully and slowly beginning to happen. But the \"other\", in terms of race, religion or ethnicity (forget same-sex partners) is still, according to Sardar, far from welcome in the Asian family.</p> <p>It's a shame he holds this view, and that he, in keeping with his role as head of his family, takes it on himself to be the voice of one community to another. I was brought up to respect my parents, speak Hindi, make chapattis and be grateful for aloo gobi sandwiches in my school packed lunch. My favourite music includes Ravi Shankar and tunes from Bollywood movies. I've met a man who shares this taste in music, wants to learn Hindi; we hope to be able to afford to have my father and his parents live with us, or near us, one day if they want to, and will look after them in their old age. We don't know what the future will bring but we do know that it's up to us to make it work and our families will support us in this, and in whatever we decide.</p> <p>The models of modern arranged marriage and Asian extended families are not a cure for white western cultural \"ills\". To suggest they are is at best misguided, at worst dangerous, complacently ignoring as it does the problems inherent in the Asian system. Do we, if \"we\" as a community exist, need someone to speak for us, to you, whoever you are; you who are not \"us\"? Looked at that way, it feels like there's still a long way to go.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is the US government's plan to staunch the financial crisis?</strong></p> <p>The details are still being finalised before the proposals go to Congress, which will have to approve them. What is significant is that they represent a systematic and comprehensive rather than a band-aid approach. Until now, the US has decided to save some institutions, but not all \u2013 it allowed the investment bank Lehman Brothers to fail. But the financial markets like what they are now hearing from Washington and the stock markets have taken off. Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, described his effort as \"an approach to deal with the systemic risk and the stresses in our capital markets\". The \"comprehensive\" solution would deal with the souring real estate and other illiquid assets at the heart of the financial crisis, he said.</p> <p><strong>What options are being considered?</strong></p> <p>The US has faced similar financial crises in the past, if not on this scale, so it can draw on previous models. In the 1980s, the US launched a massive bailout of the savings and loans banks - the American equivalent of Britain's building societies - that had found themselves saddled with bad debts through ill-chosen investments. To sort out the S&amp;L debacle, the US created the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which bought up and eventually sold hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of property from golf courses to fruit farms from failed savings and loan companies. </p> <p>The RTC closed or reorganised 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400bn and the assets were sold to investors looking for bargains. The rescue eventually cost American taxpayers $124bn and contributed to the large US budget deficits of the 1990s. Before that, when the American banking system got into trouble with Latin American debt in 1982, the US government invented the so-called Brady bonds, which allowed investors to turn the bad debt they were holding into bonds guaranteed by the US government. The investors took a \"haircut\" \u2013 a big loss \u2013 but they still came away with something instead of nothing. </p> <p><strong>What other ideas are being proposed?</strong></p> <p>Another idea is the creation of federal insurance for investors in money-market funds, which are supposed to be ultra-safe investments. But investors have been pulling out their money along with the general panic, so the government is considering guarantees for these funds similar to those that safeguard bank deposits. The move is designed to stem the outflow of funds from even these safest of investments, and to stop financial contagion from spreading to the rest of the banking system. Americans hold about $3.4tn (\u00a31.87tn) in money-market funds.</p> <p><strong>So will we see another Resolution Trust Corporation?</strong></p> <p>It's still unclear what this entity - dubbed \"bad bank\" - will do exactly. The RTC took over failing S&amp;Ls in their entirety. This time round, the new body might just purchase assets at a greatly reduced value and sell them back to the market. One issue will be how the government will value the assets it takes over. One possible option could be to sell them through auction, so that the government would not have to get involved in negotiating asset prices. US treasury department officials have reportedly studied a structure to buy up distressed assets for weeks, but are unsure whether it would win congressional approval. However, the depth of the crisis has ensured that even Republican free-market ideologues will be receptive to the bailout plans. Congressional leaders say a plan could be approved by the end of next week, a remarkably short time for complex legislation, but it underlines the gravity of the crisis.</p> <p><strong>Does such a plan mean a U-turn for the Bush administration?</strong></p> <p>George Bush and his top advisers have until now strongly opposed a big bailout that would eventually be borne by the taxpayer. But the mortgage crisis has already forced the treasury and the Fed to bail out four of America's biggest financial institutions - Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the huge mortgage companies, and American International Group, the insurance giant. When the concerted action by the world's central banks failed to restore confidence to the markets yesterday, the bailout plans gained momentum. Big hitters in the financial world, such as Paul Volcker, the highly respected former Fed chairman, and Paul Brady, the former US treasury secretary who gave his name to those Brady bonds, have argued for a comprehensive approach along the lines of the S&amp;L crisis. </p> <p><strong>How much will all this cost?</strong></p> <p>At this stage it's too early to tell, but the US government will have to commit taxpayers' money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed assets from struggling institutions. The scale of the crisis will mean that the cost will be much bigger than the S&amp;L bailout. The common thread to all bailout plans is that the taxpayer eventually has to bear the cost - but the alternative is the higher cost of a failing banking system.</p>",
  "<p>I posted the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/sep/18/uk\">email from a Telegraph journalist yesterday</a> because, despite my misgivings, I think he/she articulated many complaints I hear, and receive, from journalists who have come into the business in the past decade or so. These are the people who knew just a little of life in newsrooms <strong><em>before</em></strong> the net and are now living through the disruptions caused by the changing culture of multi-platform journalism.</p> <p>Let's get one thing understood right away. All notions that reporting and subbing on national papers was infinitely better/ more professional/ more informative for readers/ journalistically superior to the present day are a form of misguided nostalgia. (See similar comments from both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/sep/18/uk?commentpage=1\">Waltroon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.countervalue.com/2008/09/18/more-from-those-halcyon-telegraph-days/\">Justin Williams</a>). It was undeniably more fun. There was heavy drinking, access to seemingly unlimited cash through expenses (often paid in advance), a relaxed working regime and generous rewards for extra casual work. </p> <p>But those of us who were lucky enough to have lived through it also know that it was not one long party. Some people, especially those who were aiming for promotion, worked very hard indeed. The hours were unsocial and could be long. While some journalists did manage to do little, the work ethic among many more was strong. Perspiration usually scored over inspiration.</p> <p>What I want to stress, in a direct rebuttal of the emailer's contention about matters having changed, is that right from the moment I first stepped into Fleet Street in 1969 the \"levels of commitment - in hours and workload\" were demanding. Most executives did work 70-hour weeks. And, knowing what life was like for those colleagues of mine down the years who were married, I guess it's possible to argue that their working life was \"unsustainable in conjunction with a normal family life\" (though one might ask: what is a normal family life?)</p> <p>The work-hard-play-hard culture began to disintegrate from 1986 onwards, following the Wapping revolution, as owners and managers regained the initiative after some 40 years of trade union domination (and Fleet Street was left behind). Editors were expected to be more \"one of us\" - the management - rather than \"one of them\", the editorial staff. (This was true in both national and regional newspapers incidentally). The 1990-91 recession started a process of rationalisation. Staffing numbers, wages and expenses began to be the subject of continual review. (Note the comment by <strong>jontus</strong>).</p> <p>Then, of course, came the internet and the birth of the digital revolution. The impact of this technological breakthrough was misunderstood at first. Some owners invested heavily, hiring more staff, while others stood back. It seemed, for just a moment, that there were was to be a new boom time for journalists, with one set producing in print and another producing online. </p> <p>Regional owners were among the first to see through this nonsense, realising that journalism was in a transition stage. And the Telegraph were among the first of the national groups to understand its revolutionary import. Multi-platform journalism would, for the foreseeable future, be an imperative. A large, settled audience must be served in print (in order to try to preserve ad revenue). But a growing new audience must be served digitally, on computer or by mobile phone.</p> <p>Yet, and this is the key to understanding the reason for the problems highlighted by the emailer, this revolution has occurred against a background of fast-declining profitability across the whole newspaper industry. In other words, at a time when investment is required to fund innovation, revenues are decreasing. The result? Professional journalists, the people at the word-face, the traditional content-providers, are being expected to do much more than ever before.</p> <p>They are also doing so in the face of a totally new journalistic environment, one in which the audience - a previously passive construct - is becoming much more active through increased participation. Citizen journalism may be in its infancy, and may not yet be a coherent force, but it is clear that it is going to be in future. So career journalists are, as the emailer implied, feeling the squeeze.</p> <p>The changes are certainly disturbing. But is it a reason for pessimism?<br>I am sympathetic to those journalists suffering from depressed salaries (I have not been immune to that, having taken substantial pay cuts in recent years). I do recognise that employers will take, and are taking, liberties. They pay themselves too much and often pay journalists too little. Then again, I also understand that, as companies, they are struggling to survive.</p> <p>But I do not agree that we have reached, or are likely to reach, a stage in which wages make a journalistic career impossible to follow. What is more likely to happen is ever-smaller central staffs - at the hub, to borrow a Telegraph analogy - who will be well rewarded for their essential work.</p> <p>By the way, my emailing friend, I wouldn't knock \"vocation\" as a reason to be a journalist. Idealism, even in this vicious commercial world of ours, is to be celebrated. Anyway, vocational journalism is surely another name for citizen journalism, is it not?</p> <p>I agree that \"facts are no longer the currency they used to be\", which is one reason why views dominate on the web. But I do share with <strong>Waltroon</strong> a worry about maintaining staffs of sufficient quantity and quality to dig up facts that don't sit up and present themselves. Investigative journalism must not be allowed to wither, though I do not see that happening at present.</p> <p>Of course society must be \"equipped to hold the powerful to account\". But, again, there is no sign that we are failing in that task. Indeed, the net opens up avenues for us to explore what the powerful are up to. All is not lost. All will not be lost.</p> <p>Finally, I urge the emailer to see things as they are. I believe in opting in. I am an optimist. I do not believe we're going to hell in a handcart.

  "<p>Hours of taking measurements in wind and rain have paid off for the proud people of Wales who woke up today to discover that they have a new mountain.</p> <p>More than 7,000 satellite readings have persuaded the Ordnance Survey that Mynydd Graig Goch in Snowdonia has been wrongly recorded as a mere hill for more than a century.</p> <p>The difference is just 30 inches in rock and earth, but an enormous leap in terms of linguistics and status. Now reclassified as standing six inches over 2,000ft (609 metres), instead of the previous official height of 1,998ft, the craggy outcrop between Porthmadog and the Lleyn peninsular has become Wales' 190th official mountain.</p> <p>Proof that the final jumble of rocks reached the 2,000ft qualifying point was assembled by three Welsh fellwalkers with a passion for detail. Like the meticulous Alfred Wainwright, who challenged a string of OS measurements in the Lake District, Myrddyn Phillips, Graham Jackson and John Barnard decided to check three borderline cases.</p> <p>Using state-of-the-art equipment given by the Swiss specialists Leica Geosystems, they trekked up Mynydd Graig Goch and two other peaks, Craig Fach in Snowdonia and Mynydd Troed near Crickhowell in Powys, which are also measured at 1,998ft on OS maps.</p> <p>Barnard, who lives in Welshpool, Powys, said yesterday that the gentler contours of Mynydd Troed were, as suspected, correctly designated a hill, and the survey actually reduced Craig Fach's height by 1ft.</p> <p>But Mynydd Graig Goch, which in Welsh cannily means either Red Rock Mountain or Red Rock Hill, was always the group's main target. Barnard said: \"It's fantastic. Winds of between 40 and 50mph (64-80kph) made things quite difficult for us and it rained during the survey, but it was worth it.</p> <p>\"We're very pleased to have proved that Mynydd Graig Goch is a mountain and not a hill. The Ordnance Survey has agreed to <a href=\"http://leisure.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/leisure/products.jsp?xvalue=249500&amp;yvalue=348500&amp;q=graig+goch&amp;zoomindex=3&amp;regionkey=GB&amp;minx=0&amp;maxx=0&amp;miny=0&amp;maxy=0&amp;placename=Mynydd%20Graig%20Goch&amp;publisher=allpub\">update its maps on the internet straight away</a>.\"</p> <p>Paper maps will be corrected on the next print run, in a real-life rerun of the 1995 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112966/\">The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain</a>. Set in 1917 and starring Hugh Grant as a government cartographer, the comedy describes how Welsh villagers ingeniously challenge a proposed downgrading of their local landmark from a mountain to a hill.</p> <p>The classifications are more a matter of custom than law, but Mynydd Graig Goch's new height meets the most severe of British tests. Other definitions allow use of the term 'mountain' at 600 metres or even 1,000ft in cases such as Roseberry Topping, Yorkshire's 1,049ft Little Matterhorn, where \"the immediate rise is sufficiently abrupt\".</p>",
  "<p>After nearly a quarter-century of making movies Joel and Ethan Coen<br>finally notched up their <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20225692,00.html\">first number one opening</a> last weekend. Burn After Reading, a defiantly right-brain exercise in screwball comedy boasting a spectacular ensemble, wasn't expected to launch at the top of the US charts last weekend: many predicted the glory would go to the Bob De Niro/Al Pacino double act <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/05/drama.thriller\">Righteous Kill</a>. Clearly the Coens didn't get the memo and, ever the contrarians, fashioned a career-best $19.1m launch.</p> <p>The result came in approximately $5m higher than expected and gave Working Title's US distributor Focus Features its biggest opening weekend. Focus' chief executive officer James Schamus, an affable bow-tied renaissance man who earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and is that rare beast who combines artistic talent with business acumen, got together with his team to plot this one far in advance and it paid dividends.</p> <p>Focus elected to follow a familiar distribution pattern that it had deployed for several other prestige autumn releases in recent years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/sep/17/anglee.heathledger\">Brokeback Mountain</a> and last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/30/features.jamesrobinson\">Lust, Caution</a> each secured a world premiere slot at the Venice Film Festival followed by a North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. This worked particularly well for Brokeback Mountain, which went on to gross more than $80m in the US and $180m worldwide and converted three of its eight Academy Award nominations into Oscars.</p> <p>Nobody expects Burn After Reading to be an awards season player, however the tide of goodwill and mostly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/27/venicefilmfestival.coenbrothers1\">favourable reviews</a> coming out of Venice and Toronto bode well for its earning power. Screwball comedies rarely prosper at the box office because they're a little too leftfield for the mainstream and while the mainstream isn't the Coens' target constituency, it was important that Burn After Reading gained traction among a broad audience right off the bat because Focus chose to release the film in 2,651 theatres \u2013 a wide release.</p> <p>Most Coen films start out with a limited run and use positive word of mouth to build momentum and expand gradually into more theatres. Even their biggest hit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/18/drama.thriller\">No Country For Old Men</a> did that last November when it launched in a mere 28 theatres. But Focus top brass knew they could leverage their astonishing cast into a lucrative launch. There aren't too many films that can lay claim to the services of Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton and Frances McDormand. (Can we agree to ignore the all-star Danny Ocean franchise, a series of celluloid insults whose storylines linger in the memory for almost as long as it takes to reel off the A-list cast?) The TV advertising spots for Burn After Reading highlighted the story's whimsical tone and made much of Pitt's goofy turn as an unethical fitness club employee who hatches a get-rich-quick scheme when he and McDormand chance upon a CIA agent's unpublished memoirs.</p> <p>It worked. The Coens' traditional fanbase of older viewers supported the film during the daytime and evening shows, but this time it also played well into the night. This isn't the normal pattern among mature film-going audiences, Focus' domestic distribution chief Jack Foley told me, and the phenomenon was shaped by a young crowd. In fact 16% of people who paid to see Burn After Reading in its first three days were under 25 \u2013 not your typical Coen Bros demographic, although certainly happy enough to ogle Pitt and Clooney and enjoy 96 minutes of light entertainment that's about as far away from Anton Chigurh and his cattle gun as it gets.</p> <p>The key this weekend will be to consolidate in the major cities. Foley<br>is keeping Burn After Reading in roughly the same level of theatres and can expect a decent second weekend hold against moderate opposition. Pundits are talking about $11m for the second weekend. The following week will prove more challenging when Paramount releases the thriller <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059786/\">Eagle Eye</a> starring hotshot Shia LaBeouf. So what does Burn After Reading face this weekend? The new arrivals are: Sony's thriller <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947802/\">Lakeview Terrace</a> starring the erratic leading man Samuel Jackson as a bullying patrolman; prolific Lionsgate's comedy <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1046163/\">My Best Friend's Girl</a> with Kate Hudson and the overrated US comic Dane Cook; MGM's release for The Weinstein Company of the animated film Igor; and Paramount's comedy <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995039/\">Ghost Town</a> starring Ricky Gervais in the Englishman's first outing in a lead role. According to the online experts none of these is expected to gross more than $15m.</p>",
  "<p>Two suspected militants were killed after a dramatic gun battle in a police raid on a home in a Muslim-dominated area of the Indian capital that brought angry protests from local residents.<br> Less than a week after a series of bomb blasts claimed more than 20 lives in Delhi, police and militants were said to have traded bullets for about two hours this morning.  Two militants died, one was arrested and another two escaped in the maze of tiny lanes in Jamia Nagar. Two police officers were being treated for gunshot wounds. Police claimed to have recovered weapons, including an AK-47 machine gun, from the fourth-floor apartment. The shootout comes six days after serial blasts struck the heart of the capital's busiest markets killing more than 20.  Many residents complained that the raid, which saw elite anti-terrorist commandoes move in with the police, was a \"fake encounter\" and that no militants had been in the building.  In protest, local shops closed and a number of residents came out on to the narrow streets shouting slogans. Many appeared perturbed that the police had used deadly force near a local mosque. More than 5,000 police were quickly drafted in to keep the peace. The security forces however were quick to say that the apartment had been identified as a bolt-hole for \"terrorists\" by one of the men police say was responsible for the blasts in Ahmedabad in July which left 45 people dead. Abu Bashar, who according to reports is one of the masterminds behind the Ahmedabad blasts, had been brought to the Indian capital yesterday for interrogation. He had been taken to Jamia Nagar, say police, to identify the place where he had allegedly stayed with other militants. Sources told Indian news channels that the \"terrorist cell\" had been planning more strikes in Delhi. In the past few days it has become clear that police have blundered repeatedly in the past year in their attempts to track terrorist cells, particularly in the Muslim community who have been wary of cooperating with Indian intelligence.  Aware that security is becoming a political issue, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, admitted yesterday to \"vast gaps\" in intelligence gathering. The cabinet approved proposals to hire 7,000 additional police officers in New Delhi, install closed-circuit television cameras in busy areas and create a research wing in its intelligence agency.</p>",

Is Howard Davies right to say that contemporary novelists \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/234ed664-5048-11dc-a6b0-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1\">are bad at business</a>\"? <br><br>Joseph O'Neill's Netherland seems reasonably close to the novel about the \"life and loves of a \u00a330m a year arbitrage trader\" which Davies envisaged. The protagonist of O'Neill's novel is an oil market analyst at an investment bank in New York, who later moves to London. As <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n14/kunk01_.html\">Benjamin Kunkel has noted</a>, for someone who spends much of his time jetting between London and New York, Hans is near-silent on his work, and indeed money in general. Davies was presumably looking for a novel which dealt more closely with the world of business. </p> <p>Even in the US, which has produced some fine novels about business, the most acclaimed novel about working life published in recent years - Joshua Ferris's Then We Came to the End - pushes the realities of business into the background. Few reasons are given for the downfall of the nameless advertising company whose offices host most of the novel (it is fairly clearly set in<a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/1990-11136_1-6278387-1.html\"> the fallout of the dotcom boom</a>) although the foreboding sense of one's colleagues being picked off one by one has real resonance today. </p> <p>Another novel which was undoubtedly partly inspired by financial events at the end of the 20th century is Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty. Although it is set in the 1980s, the financial scandal which causes the downfall of a central character is \"creative accounting\" \u2013 which would resonate with readers in 2004, with Enron and Worldcom still in recent memory. Despite the novel being set in a world of 1980s finance and politics, its protagonist Nick Guest claims to know nothing about either. </p> <p>Guest's professed ignorance of even the most basic details of a \"huge asset-stripping controversy in the 70s\", instigated by someone he has met several times, exasperates his friend Toby, who gives up and says \"you were probably doing Chaucer that week\". Nick might like to pretend that he is unaffected by economic concerns, but his increasingly cocaine-fuelled lifestyle is paid for by a lump sum given to him by his lover, who also secures his future by buying him an office building. He is never comfortable in the City of London, thinking that the buildings and their inhabitants possess \"a watchful half-smile of secret knowledge\" \u2013 in a novel full of similarly wry smiles, Nick is threatened by this genuinely powerful knowledge being inaccessible to the self-styled aesthete.</p> <p>While money is at the heart of each of these books, their focus is elsewhere. Hollinghurst is interested in the position of the aesthete in an era of financial greed and consumer culture; O'Neill's protagonist tries to separate the personal and the financial, in both his marriage and his friendships, and Ferris wants to examine the relationships which result from working for a failing business. None of them has taken up the challenge of examining head-on the intricate worlds of derivatives and repackaged debt. Maybe this is not so surprising, when the so-called \"<a href=\"http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/-How-the-Masters-of.4494032.jp\">Masters of the Universe</a>\" who invented these ultra-complex systems seem unable to control (and <a href=\"http://www.houseonomics.com/viewpostblogdetails.php?blogid=4\">perhaps even understand</a>) them.</p>",
  "<p>Barbara Castle should have been Labour's \u2013 and Britain's \u2013 first female prime minister. What a role model she would have been: passionate, fiery and absolutely committed to social justice. </p> <p>She was a brilliant orator. In her diaries, she writes about \"playing\" with the audience \u2013 teasing them, driving them to anger, to laughter and back again. And there was no one better at getting Labour conference on her side. In an age of tub-thumping, political rhetoric, before television put a premium on conversational styles, Barbara found a way of speaking that was strong, commanding but never macho.</p> <p>I first met Barbara in the early 1970s when she was shadow social security minister, I was in my first job, at Age Concern, and we both appeared on a TV special on pensions, pouring scorn on Keith Joseph's proposed second pension scheme that would have left women with lower pensions than men in return for equal contributions. Afterwards, she was mobbed by an adoring studio audience. Back in government a few years later, she introduced <a href=\"http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/state-pension/serps/home.asp\">Serps</a> to guarantee a second pension to all employees, women as well as men. </p> <p>Barbara's biggest achievement, of course, was the <a href=\"www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1970/PDF/ukpga_19700041_en.pdf\">Equal Pay Act (pdf)</a>, introduced in 1970 following the <a href=\"http://womensgrid.freecharity.org.uk/?p=89\">strike</a> by women workers at Ford's Dagenham plant. Women MPs were few and far between \u2013 indeed, there were more MPs called John than there were women in the House of Commons. They were the butt of sexist jokes, from Tory and Labour men alike, and stereotyped as only being interested in \"women's issues\". But Barbara never flinched from taking on the cause of equal pay. </p> <p>Getting the Equal Pay law passed was not straightforward. In January 1966, as the government wrestled with rising inflation, Barbara recorded in her diaries that she tried to persuade the unions to open discussions on \"how equal pay could be applied within the prices and incomes policy\". In June 1968, faced with defeat on a rebellious backbencher's equal pay amendment, she used \"a carefully worded formula promising immediate discussions with the CBI and the TUC on a timetable for phasing in equal pay\". The following year, she told cabinet that \"we had run out of delaying excuses though we had behaved with an inertia worthy of the Northern Ireland government!\" She was canny, she negotiated, but she got exactly what she wanted \u2013 as she said in the second reading, \"another historic advance in the struggle against discrimination in our society\". </p> <p>Barbara Castle was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/19/labour.past\">hero</a> to millions of British women. She inspired a new generation of women to become active in Labour politics, including of course Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman. Unlike Margaret Thatcher, who never appointed another woman to her cabinet, Barbara was a feminist who staunchly advanced the cause of women.</p> <p>Modern politics would have been very different if she had succeeded in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Place_of_Strife\">reforming</a> Britain's outdated industrial relations laws in the late 1960s: her defeat at the hands of Jim Callaghan and the union barons paved the way for the \"winter of discontent\" and Thatcher's landslide a decade later. Today, when some trade union leaders are trying once again to turn the clock back, we need a heroine like Barbara Castle to remind us that being a moderniser is entirely compatible with a commitment to social justice.</p>",

  "<p><strong>11am</strong> Aigburth - a quiet start this morning, with Lancashire's overnight batsmen Glen Chapple and Tom Smith extending their eighth-wicket stand past 50, only a couple of lbw appeals from Yasir Arafat to worry them, and Kent skipper Rob Key recalling James Tredwell from the Mersey End in only the seventh over of the day, begins <em>Andy Wilson</em>.

But they are still 100 short of that, with only Keedy and Oliver Newby to come.</p> <p>Away from this game, Lancashire's chief executive Jim Cumbes has confirmed that there is likely to be much more county cricket played at what has become the club's preferred outground - well ahead of Blackpool, after last month's washout against Surrey - while the square at Old Trafford is reorientated from east-west to north-south over the next couple of years. Lancashire finally hope to be able to make some detailed announcements about their plans for the ground next week, assuming the scheme is given initial approval by Trafford Borough Council.</p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> Forget all that stuff about a quiet morning, reports <em>Andy Wilson</em>. Five wickets have now fallen in nine overs - and Kent, set 163 to win after Yasir Arafat polished off the Lancashire innings in the space of 10 balls, are in a spot of bother at 10 for two. Chapple and Newby are bowling so well that even Key is having to ride his luck, although crucially, he's still there - the men out have been Joe Denly, losing his off stump to Newby and therefore bagging a pair, and Geraint Jones, edging a perfect leg-cutter from Chapple. Earlier Arafat had Chapple caught behind, yorked Keedy two balls later, and then trapped Newby lbw to complete figures of four for 41.</p> <p><strong>12.10pm</strong> It has been a nightmarish morning for Durham, writes <em>David Hopps</em> at Chester-le-Street. The slog for the vital fourth batting has gone horribly wrong and, after beginning the third day at 325-4, they have been bowled out 75 minutes into the morning session for 380. Things went wrong from the outset as Mohammad Sami had Gareth Breese lbw before Durham had added to their overnight score. The removal of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, bowled as he drove airily at Jason Lewry, after he had added eight to his overnight 130, then introduced further calamities: Callum Thorpe was out hit wicket after he was struck on the head by Sami, The Colonel - Phil Mustard - dragged on horribly as he tried to hack a slower, wide one from Sami over midwicket and a sorry procession ended when Steve Harmison missed a full toss. </p> <p>Durham will try to convince themselves the collapse has revealed more in the pitch than was apparent for much of yesterday. But should Lancashire lose to Kent by mid-afternoon then Sussex will be more persuaded than ever to take the draw points, which would then leave themselves and Yorkshire needing nothing more next week than a cosy little draw at Hove to send the Red Rose county down.<br><strong><br>12.35pm</strong> It was a morning of further punishment for Surrey at The Oval, writes <em>Lawrence Booth</em>. When Andre Adams swung Stuart Meaker into the hands of Lee Hodgson at deep backward square leg shortly after 12.15pm, Nottinghamshire were all out for 532, which a local statistician assures us is their third-highest total against Surrey. Their lead, with five sessions of the match to go, is 265 and the way things have gone for Surrey so far you would not bet against Notts completing the job today.</p> <p>Most of the nails were banged in by Graeme Swann, who turned his overnight 30 into a cleanly hit 82 from 88 balls, his highest score of the season, before he was bowled behind his legs on the sweep by Murtaza Hussain. Mark Ealham chipped in with 36 and Shoaib Akhtar contributed another four wicketless overs to a section on his CV that he may do best to erase.</p> <p>One curiosity: Surrey emerged this morning with their fourth wicket-keeper of the innings as Gary Wilson, the Ireland international, became the latest player to step in for Jon Batty, who broke a finger yesterday. The catch he took to dismiss Chris Read, who threw the kitchen sink at a widish delivery, was spectacular: a full-length dive across the slips that flew in the face of both first slip and Surrey's general demeanour. Still, at least they didn't lose a wicket in the only over they had to face before lunch. Sixty-seven overs remain today and it's touch and go whether they'll survive them.</p> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> There's as much attention being paid to the news from Liverpool as to proceedings in the middle at Scarborough, writes <em>Richard Rae</em>. The announcement of the fall of the first two Kent wickets was greeted with a sort of nervous chuckle, the rest in grim silence. Talk is now turning to the need for Yorkshire to go on and win this match, and it is possible, because though Adam Lyth went early, Anthony McGrath and Jacques Rudolph are scoring quickly and easily. If Yorkshire can build a decent lead an hour into the final day, Adil Rashid's leg-spin gives them hope of running through Somerset's second innings.</p> <p><strong>12.45pm</strong> Lunch at Aigburth, and the end of a remarkable session which may have turned this game on its head, writes <em>Andy Wilson</em>. Kent, needing 163 to win, are 38 for five. Three of the wickets have gone to Chapple, who has bowled beautifully from the pavilion end and claimed the coveted scalp of Key with a cracker that lifted and left him, flicking the glove on the way through to Luke Sutton. Darren Stevens was next to, brilliantly caught by Stuart Law at second slip diving low to his left, and Tom Smith then weighed in with the wicket of Justin Kemp, driving loosely to Francois du Plessis at point. But Martin van Jaarsveld is still there on 19, having pulled one six already. It's compelling stuff - outground cricket on tricky pitches always seems more appealing.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> Well it's all over here, writes <em>Paul Weaver</em>. Middlesex required just 56 minutes and 12.1 overs to knock off the 67 runs required to beat Worcestershire by eight wickets.</p> <p>There was a surprisingly decent turn-out for the final rites. This was only Worcestershire's second defeat of the season and it was an anti-climax for the club and everyone concerned with them. A win or a draw here would have been enough to confirm their promotion to the first division. </p> <p>As it is the players were mooching around the Chester Road ground as they followed events at Chelmsford, where the Essex and Warwickshire meant that celebrations here had to be delayed.</p> <p>\"It's a disappointing way to end the season,\" said Vikram Solanki, the Worcestershire captain. \"We have played badly only twice in the second division this season, against Derbyshire and in this game. We have let ourselves down.</p> <p>\"But I feel that we have played the best cricket in the division this season. I don't mean that to sound arrogant. I just feel we have played good cricket and we deserve our promotion.\"</p> <p>Andrew Strauss ensured there would be no mishap this morning with an unbeaten 28 from 37 balls, with five fours. Owais Shah hit 22 from just 15 balls with five fours. But with just two runs required he went for glory and attempted to hit Chris Whelan over the top only to hole out to mid-off.</p> <p>Middlesex have shown in this match that they should have been in the promotion shake-up. But too many important bowlers were injured and theur big-name batsmen failed to fire.<br><strong><br>2.05pm</strong> Exactly last year Durham were beaten by Lancashire on a dodgy pitch at Blackpool and their chance of a championship disappeared as a result, writes <em>David Hopps</em> at Chester-le-Street. Move forward a year and Lancashire could be about to beat Kent on another dubious surface, this time down the coast at Liverpool. On each occasion, there has been no penalty for an unfit pitch. On each occasion Lancashire have prospered.</p> <p>That is the sort of discussion takning place at The Riverside, where Durham and Sussex are caught in a stalemate on a lifeless pitch. Their frustration at an increasingly lacklustre affair encourages them to imagine monstrosities at Liverpool.</p> <p>You might imagine that it is Durham, whose chances of a first championship are slipping away, who would have most cause for ill humour. But it is actually Sussex. If Lancashire beat Kent then Sussex are dragged right back into the relegation zone.</p> <p>A couple of hours ago you might have gained the impression that I had intimated that, once Kent had duly beaten Lancashire, next week's final match between Sussex and Yorkshire could become a cosy, agreeable draw, which would be enough to bring both counties safety. Nothing could be further from the truth. What I intended to convey was that once Lancashire beat Kent it would actually become a desperate, tooth-baring battle between two counties haunted by the fear of relegation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Riverside, Sussex are 80-2. Will Smith brilliantly ran out Michael Yardy with a direct hit at the bowler's end from cover, and Steve Harmison removed Luke Wright cheaply. Apart from that a depressing calm has descended.</p> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong> Surrey are in all kinds of trouble here at The Oval, writes <em>Lawrence Booth</em>. With more than 40 overs of the day's play to go, they are 58 for five, which is effectively 58 for six because of Jon Batty's broken finger. Nottinghamshire will take a full 22 points from this game, which is likely to make them strong favourites for the title going into next week's final round of matches. It's been one-way traffic \u2013 but with less ebb and flow.</p> <p>Surrey needed 265 just to make Notts bat again, but Chris Murtagh nicked Charlie Shreck in the third over to complete a miserable pair before Mark Ramprakash fell for just five to a juggling catch by Will Jefferson at second slip as he prodded at Darren Pattinson. It was soon 17 for three when Pattinson slipped a yorker through Scott Newman's defences and took out middle stump, only to spoil the effect by celebrating a little too vociferously and a little too closely to Newman's face. Newman wasn't impressed, and turned round several times on his way to the pavilion to add his tuppence worth to proceedings. For those who saw Pattinson send Ramprakash on his way with a snarl in the corresponding fixture earlier in the season at Trent Bridge, it was a bit too familiar for comfort.</p> <p>Pattinson then had Usman Afzaal caught in the gully off a no-ball, but the great thing about bowling to these Surrey batsmen is that you know they are unlikely to make you pay. Sure enough, Afzaal could add only 10 before missing an airy drive against Andre Adams. And it was 57 for five when Lee Hodgson, who batted so promisingly in the first innings, prodded Graeme Swann to short leg. He didn't enjoy the decision. But then Surrey have not exactly enjoyed their summer.</p>",

  "<p>Not many people could have pointed <a href=\"http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Abu+Dhabi&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title\">Abu Dhabi</a> out on the map a few weeks ago. But after last week's clash of old and new empires \u2013 the Abramovich billions versus the Nahyan trillions \u2013 the UAE now seems to be the go to place to uncover stacks of unspent cash eager to find its way into Premier League coffers. Want out of your hastily purchased club commitments? Hated by your own fans? Simply take your begging bowl to the Persian Gulf. Mike Ashley may have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/17/newcastleunited.premierleague\">the first to do it so shamelessly</a>, but he won't be the last.</p> <p>Emirati oil money has changed the financial landscape of the Premier League. Yet there is a strange anomaly here. Closer to home the game has stagnated. For all the trillions of greenbacks, the glitzy sponsorship deals abroad designed to raise the UAE's profile (see Emirates Airlines' sponsorship of the 2006 World Cup, not to mention the rebranding of Arsenal's stadium) and the column inches detailing how a slew of England internationals call Dubai's Palm development home, little attention has been paid to the local UAE league. Until now.</p> <p>This weekend, football in the United Arab Emirates goes professional and, as with most things that the country's burghers put their minds too, the aim is to be one of the biggest and best, not just in the region, but in the world. Its success or otherwise could give us a flavour of things to come.</p> <p>It has taken its time coming. Whilst the royal families of Dubai and Abu Dhabi have been making a name for themselves abroad, other regional leagues have soared ahead. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Premier_League\">Saudi league</a> has, since going professional in 1990, been seen as the strongest, capable of attracting the region's top talent and even attracting the odd household name from Europe. Al Ittihad of Jeddah even managed to talk Portuguese international Luis Figo into signing a huge one-year contract to play on the shores of the Red Sea. Alas, shortly afterwards, David Beckham signed an even bigger contract with the LA Galaxy which heralded the flexing of American soccer's new found financial muscle. Suddenly playing a country that has a hardcore al-Qaida following and where his model wife would be banned from driving didn't appeal so much, and Figo managed to wriggle out of it.</p> <p>But the fact that the Saudis could even be in the position to attract one of the biggest names in football in the first place was indicative not just of its wealth but also of its footballing strength. In a country where none of its players ply their trade abroad, the fact that the Saudis have qualified for four consecutive World Cups is ample evidence of that.</p> <p>Qatar too has reaped the benefits of going professional. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatari_League\">Q-League</a> put the tiny gas-rich country on the map with its ambitious footballing plans, talking the likes of French World Cup winner Marcel Desailly, Argentinian striker Gabriel Batistuta and the Dutch De Boer twins, to name a few, into playing in brand new, if empty, stadiums in Doha. That may well have brought little benefit to the local players or the national team, but the naturalisation of various South American footballers, much to the consternation of Fifa and the rest of the Arab world, has. The Al Thani family, the ruling house of Qatar, even tried to bid for the summer Olympics. Recently Qatar opened up their campaign in the final Asian World Cup qualifying group with a hugely <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GL24MlZaSA\">impressive 3-0 victory</a> against a very good Uzbekistan. Even the Syrians have got into the act, turning their league pro to break the unfair monopoly controlled by Al Jaish, Syria's army team.</p> <p>With the Middle East waking up to the need to professionalise football teams if it wants to compete both globally and closer to home, the state of the UAE's local league was even more baffling. Anyone who has ventured out to watch Al Ahli or Al Wahda over the past few years would have been surprised that, in a country crazy about football, the stadiums remained stubbornly empty despite the fact that most matches were free to watch.</p> <p>The game itself was of a poor standard. Then the UAE won its first trophy, the 2007 Gulf Cup hosted in Abu Dhabi. For two weeks the country was rapt as the diminutive striker Ismail Matar took the tournament by the scruff of the neck. The victory against Oman in the final was rightly celebrated well into the night. But it was perhaps the semi-final victory against fierce rivals and regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia that was the most impressive. Thousands of white-robed emirates thronged outside the Al Nahyan stadium unable to get tickets whilst inside a sea of white exploded when Matar scored the winner deep into injury-time.</p> <p>For the UAE FA it was a watershed moment. Either football went pro or the Gulf Cup could well be the last piece of silverware the country ever attained. \"The league which is played now could have been useful 30 years back, but not now,\" was the opinion of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and president of the UAE Football Association a few weeks after the victory. \"If we do not turn to a professional league, the Asian Football Confederation will ask us to play in the amateur tournaments.\"</p> <p>Within a year his call was heeded. The UFL (UAE Football League) will see 12 teams kicking off its first season, four from Dubai, four from Abu Dhabi, one from Ajman and the three from Sharjah. Following in the footsteps of the English Premier League, the TV rights have been sold for a reported Dhs350 million, on top of the existing Dhs250 million sponsorship deal with Etisilat. This is where the bulk of the money that is about to flood the game will come from, rather than at the turnstiles where tickets will cost a modest Dhs20 to watch a game.</p> <p>A cursory look at the country's rapidly changing skyline tells you that things move quicker in the UAE than in most other places and the 12 teams present to witness the brave new dawn of professional football have had to learn quickly. The first change was the doing away of the UAE's antiquated and patently unfair transfer system. With echoes of the old British 'retain and transfer' system that existed well into the 1960s, and which really did have echoes of slavery about it, players in the UAE were only allowed to move if the club would allow it.</p> <p>A case in point concerns the UAE national team striker Faisal Khalil, whose attempts to engineer a move to a European club from Dubai's Al Ahli were amusingly detailed over the course of a few weeks in Gulf News. Faisal had attracted the attentions of second division French club Chateauroux, who he signed for in early 2006. \"I am very happy with this first step towards a professional career with Chateauroux and I hope it will be successful,\" Faisal happily told Dubai television once he'd made it to France. \"I know Chateauroux are a second division side. But I hope I can contribute with my teammates to win promotion to the first division. I will do my best.\"</p> <p>Chateauroux's manager was equally happy with the signing. \"I had visited the UAE and watched Faisal play against Al Wahda in the league and also with the UAE national team against Brazil,\" he confessed to Gulf News, even though the friendly match between the UAE and Brazil had resulted in a humiliating 8\u20130 thumping. \"He is a talented player and we are sure he will succeed with us.\" Everyone was happy. Everyone, that was, except his old club Al Ahli who were livid they had lost a key player midway through the season. Instead of getting mad, they got even.</p> <p>The UAE FA mysteriously refused to issue the proper documentation to allow him to play in France. Even though Ahli were playing hardball, Faisal was still confident of fulfilling his dream. \"I think two weeks is a good time to get all these formalities out of the way and I should be in a position to play for Chateauroux after I get back to France in the first week of March,\" he said. Al Ahli was demanding an apology from the striker and his immediate return. But higher powers had got involved, Dubai's crown prince no less.</p> <p>Twenty-five-year-old Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammad Al Maktoum also happened to be Al Ahli's president and intervened to solve the crisis. Whatever he said did the trick. Within days of the royal family's intervention Faisal was back to the UAE and ready to turn out for Ahli. Again. \"It's sad that players are so gullible and they have fallen prey to the empty promises,\" said Jassem Al Sayed, who represented Faisal, without a hint of irony. \"Faisal Khalil was lucky as his club has stood by him.\"</p> <p>These stories should be a thing of the past. Indeed, teams are already taking advantage of the new system. Al Jazira has brought in Brazilian international striker Rafael Sobis from Real Betis whilst Chilean international Jorge Valdivia joined Al Ain for a whopping $26m. Although the most significant move was Saif Mohammed's Dhs10 million transfer to Al Ain from Al Shaab. The Emirati winger was the first local player to move under the new regulations.</p> <p>But it's not just the players and club officials that have had to learn the new ropes. Professional players need professional referees and the nation's men in black have been run through their paces to try and get them up to speed. Even the police have had to take a crash course in crowd control. The disturbance at the recent UAE World Cup qualifiers in Abu Dhabi, where the Falcons managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory against Saudi Arabia, wasn't quite up there with the excesses of British hooligans in the 1980s. Throwing your gold watch at the referee, a transgression allegedly committed by one angry UAE fan, isn't quite as intimidating as coming up against a trainload of West Ham's notorious, neo-fascist Inter City Firm.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the police are taking no chances and have employed undercover officers and a system of 'black points' to punish those singing lewd or aggressive songs. \"We are ready to take on the new league,\" Lt Col Ahmed Khalfan al Mansoori told The National in the aftermath of the crowd disturbances. \"We will be using our horses more as a crowd deterrent, to prevent riots from breaking out. The problems at Dubai football matches begin with a lot of verbal abuse. Within minutes it can either escalate and explode, or it can die down.\"</p> <p>Friday's kick-off will be the litmus test as to how well the UAE can keep its own footballing house in order. Those sending covetous looks eastwards should pay close attention.</p> <p><em>When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone (Mainstream/Random House) by James Montague is available through <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/When-Friday-Comes-Football-Zone/dp/1845963695/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1221816266&amp;sr=8-1\">www.amazon.co.uk</a></em></p>",

  "<p>\"What we commonly think of as the 'Arab and Muslim world' is in fact a rich and varied mosaic of peoples. Over the last 50 years, many Middle Eastern minorities have been oppressed or have struggled to survive - be they national groups (Berbers, Kurds, Turkomans, etc), religious communities (Christians, Zoroastrians, Baha'is, etc) or both (Armenians, Jews, etc) \u2026\"</p> <p>This was <a href=\"http://www.harif.org/feki.html\">the blurb</a> for a talk last night hosted by the London Middle East Institute, and attended by a fascinating collection of representatives from the region's forgotten minorities, even a Zoroastrian lady - one of the few remaining adherents of a faith that once dominated Iran and much of the surrounding area.</p> <p>The main speaker was Egyptian-born <a href=\"http://www.masrifeki.com/english.2.000.0.htm\">Masri Feki</a>, the founder of a French-based pressure group called <a href=\"http://www.mep-online.org/\">The Middle East Pact</a>, who had come over from Toulouse.</p> <p>\"Masri Feki sees minority rights as central to his vision of secular democracy,\" the blurb said. \"Now, more than ever, thriving minorities are the cornerstone of a healthy civil society and the key to pluralism and peace in this troubled region.\"</p> <p>Well, I'm not so sure about that. As Mr Feki rightly pointed out in his talk, ethnic and religious diversity is something that pan-Arab nationalists and, more recently, Islamists, have tried to obliterate. But what's so special about minorities as such?</p> <p>How much sympathy should we feel for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alawites\">Alawite minority</a> who rule Syria? Or the Sunni minority who rule Bahrain? And then there's the Kurdish minority in Iraq - I've heard some horrible stories about the way some of them treat another minority, the <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/arab/background/turkoman.htm\">Turkomans</a>.</p> <p>Of all the oppressed people in the Middle East, those most widely and consistently denied their rights are women. Whether they happen to be more or less numerous than men is surely beside the point.</p> <p>Well-intentioned as they may be, Mr Feki's efforts to focus special attention on the region's minorities strike me as the result of some muddled thinking. This is not to suggest that minority rights are necessarily unimportant; it is vital to protect them, for example, in a democratic countries.</p> <p>In democracies, the will of the majority is supreme and so we need safeguards to ensure that the majority does not abuse its position by oppressing minorities. In most of the Middle East, though, with only a very limited measure of democracy, minorities and majorities are largely irrelevant: prejudice, discrimination, intolerance and bigotry are rife, full stop.</p> <p>A couple of months ago I was in the Middle East, researching this problem for a book that I am writing and two points in particular stood out.</p> <p>One is that very few people grasp the concept of diversity. Difference - whether ethnic, religious, cultural or sexual - is viewed as an embarrassment and something you keep quiet about. The roots of this attitude lie deep in the history and culture but it's a far cry from the idea, now prevalent in the west, that diversity is valuable and enriches a society rather than weakening it.</p> <p>The second point is that the principle of equality - equal rights, equality before the law, equality of opportunity, etc - has not really been taken on board either. \"It's not that people haven't heard of these concepts,\" Nadime Houry, a researcher for <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> told me when I met him in Lebanon. He explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most laws - and [Arab] constitutions as well - are framed in a way [that says] \"we are against discrimination, we are for equality and all citizens are born equal\" \u2013 but all these slogans ring hollow when you look at them more closely ... Even within society the sense of equality or non-discrimination is absent. It's not just the state that is the culprit here. Most examples of discrimination are between people, but no one is really going to take a strong stand to push for that equality. </p> </blockquote> <p>In Cairo, Hossam Bahgat, director of the <a href=\"http://www.eipr.org/en/index.htm\">Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights</a>, echoed this view. \"People can immediately spot injustice and stand up for the oppressed,\" he said, \"but it's not the same thing as discrimination or inequality. They don't spot inequality as easily. They can see why torture is wrong, why the imprisonment of a journalist or a political activist is wrong. They see the abuse. But just because someone is not getting exactly the same treatment as another person is not as shocking to their moral system as simple abuse.\" </p> <p>A large part of the problem, he said, is the sheer pervasiveness of injustice and inequality. \"It affects everyone almost, apart from the lucky few \u2013 so it becomes a matter of 'why them?'</p> <p>\"Another part of the problem,\" he continued, \"is that it's all a power game, so a middle-class middle-aged civil servant in the ministry of transport who is working in inhuman conditions and gets very poor treatment from his superiors would take this out on his wife or his children or his Coptic neighbour.

  "<p>As all sage traders know: when America sneezes, the world catches a cold. And, it seems, not just by way of falling prices. Yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=anmMU2xgya08&amp;refer=uk\">inane decree</a> by the FSA, banning the short selling of financial stocks, makes the <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j1qYpENSJmaTaTiLWSUFodScpFTwD938R0K80\">SEC</a>'s decision on Wednesday seem tame by comparison. It is an outrageous abuse of the free enterprise principle. The FSA's intervention is the market equivalent of book burning; utterly unacceptable, yet predictably par for the course in today's climate of fear. </p> <p>History attests to the fact that financial crises bring out the worst in the masses, and the action taken by the FSA is nothing more than vigilante violence on a national scale. Problems in the economy? Let's find a scapegoat. Too difficult to blame the real culprits? Let's pick on a minority, surround their homes with flaming torches, and drive them out into the wilderness. </p> <p>While at first blush this may seem a harsh judgment, the mindset behind the public's baying for blood (and the FSA's acting upon it) is no different to mob rule in any other situation, whether economically, politically, or racially motivated. Shock and horror is the order of the day, fuelled by either incomprehension or wilful ignorance, providing the politicians and regulators with given carte blanche to abandon the rulebook and make up a new one on the hoof. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vincentcable.org.uk/\"> Vince Cable </a> is one man who will feel vindicated by the FSA's capitulation to political demands, having vented his spleen at the hedge fund community for daring to do their jobs: that is, make money for their clients, regardless of whether the market is going up or down. He <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/vince-cable-4062.html\">blamed</a> \"aggressive\" hedge funds for \"betting against the taxpayer\", deploying incendiary rhetoric to paint the fund managers as the root of all of the imploding economy's evil. </p> <p>He was backed in his crusade by Lord Oakeshott, who opined: \"we must think long and hard before ever allowing the short-selling of British bank shares again.\" Fighting talk from the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, but talk, which pays scant regard to the proposition that if the banks can't stand the heat, they should get out of the City kitchen, and de-list their fragile shares from the rough-and-tumble market playground. </p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/creditcrunch.wallstreet?commentid=c5a9d7fb-a2e1-4c52-863f-1b4f0b24e05e\">commenter pointed out</a> on my last thread, if short-sellers were as omnipotent as people are portraying them, how come Tesco, GlaxoSmithKline, and other fundamentally sound companies aren't being driven to the wall by short positions? The disease is the mismanagement of the banks' directors; short-selling is simply a symptom. </p> <p>What's worse, and proves even more the duplicity surrounding the FSA's course of action, is that they're banning precisely those activities upon which the banks have thrived for so long. The traders of Lehmans, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/hbosbusiness?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=uknews\">HBOS</a>, et al were never shackled in their endeavours to make money out of the misery of other companies; they all profited in spades from shorting weaker stocks when the wolves were at the door. Now, however, when the hunter becomes the hunted, suddenly the law of the jungle applies no more; the FSA has effectively declared banks a protected species.</p> <p>In a cautionary tale that will \u2013 perversely \u2013 put gleeful smiles on the faces of shortophobes the length and breadth of the land, the case of the bear-squeezed <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/markets/economy/2008/09/18/volkswagen-lehman-shares-markets-equity-cx_je_0918markets12.html\">Volkswagen shares</a> shows that short-sellers aren't immune from getting taken to the cleaners. Thanks to Lehman Brothers' collapse, the VW shares lent by the bank to short-sellers were recalled early as Lehman's traders sought to unwind their positions, forcing hedge funds unwillingly into buying back their positions earlier than they had intended. </p> <p>The result was a glut of buyers and dearth of new sellers, leading to a massive rally in VW shares. The share price surged 33% in less than a week, causing untold damage to the balance sheets of those betting on a collapse in the price. Will any tears be shed for them amongst Oakeshott, Cable and co? Unlikely; they'll be too busy crowing to their adoring fans after orchestrating their hostile takeover of justice and ethics. </p> <p>Instead of arbitrarily lashing out at will, the authorities would do far better to hone their policy into one coherent set of principles that would apply to all players in all markets. Imposing massive taxes on excess profits would, at one fell swoop, put an end to the wild and untrammelled thirst for riches that drives traders at every point on the spectrum, whether they're going long, short, or sideways. </p> <p>As it was put to me earlier: \"If you take away their cocaine [in this case short-selling], they'll feed their addiction with speed.\" In the vacuum left by the ban on going short, 10 other trading mutations will spring up to fill the void. If, however, the FSA's aim is to get the monkey off the traders' backs for good, then far more stringent and across-the-board measures must be applied, and fast. Sauce for the shorting goose must be sauce for the long-trading gander; if that means fettering the entire industry in order to bring much-needed relief and stability to the markets, then so be it.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Alan Rusbridger:</strong> Some pianists would think, \"It's enough for me to play this, without having to explain.\" Do you have an instinct as a teacher?</p> <p><strong>Angela Hewitt:</strong> I do, although I don't teach regularly. I refuse all private lessons, simply as a matter of time. I hardly have time to do my own work. But yes, I think I've always liked to put words to music, whether it's writing about the pieces as I do in my notes, or giving pre-concert talks, or explaining in the masterclass why I take such-and-such a decision for interpretation. I did have some excellent teachers who gave me that. I think that if you are an interpreter and also can explain what you are doing, it helps people an awful lot. You can get a lot from just listening to someone but to have them explain to you \"Why?\", that is another thing entirely. </p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>Has being forced to articulate what you are doing taken you to a different level in your playing?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>I think so. Having to really explain rhythmic alterations in Baroque music - why you double dot, where you double dot, and not just because you feel like it, but to have the reasons for it. To really have a think about keys in Bach and what keys express a certain feeling and if there are indeed keys that seem to express certain emotions for Bach, which I think there are. It made me think about things more consciously. That has helped my interpretation, for sure. I think the two work together \u2013 the vast knowledge I gain by the performing, and also the thinking about it and the wanting to articulate it. </p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Where have you learnt from, if there are so few written sources?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong> A combination. I admire the people who go into all the libraries and gather up all the original information. I haven't done that, I must say, although I try to keep abreast of all the recent biographies \u2013 the Christoph Wolf biography of Bach and all the new publications, certainly. Basically it comes from the experience with his music, combined with reading. For instance, I'm always saying that I was glad that when I did the recordings, that I did the partitas and the French suites first before I got into the fugues. I learnt so much about the dances in Bach. There are so many pieces in the Well-Tempered Clavier that are dances, but you have to recognise them and then you have to know what to do with them. So that was a help\u2026 I learnt from books, from experience, not so much from pianists, I must say. I listened to harpsichordists, to orchestras, to people like John Eliot Gardiner and the early music crowd. </p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Why harpsichordists?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>Pianists often annoy me! A lot of them, I feel, don't play it in a true Baroque style. I still listen to them of course. I still listen to Edwin Fischer and admire the wonderful architecture he can build in a fugue. Schiff also. I think in many ways his playing is the closest to mine. I do think there's a way of playing Bach at the piano that is still stylistically correct and that's what I'm looking for.</p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>Do you practice a trill very regularly and then break it down into sixteen notes and then try and forget it and do it naturally? </p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>That's one way of doing it. And I think probably at first for a lot of kids that's the best way. Of course it's much harder to play it freer and keep the other hand steady. What I found in the end, is that you have to think of the other hand, not the trill. You have to think of shaping the more singing notes and let the trill go. But that's a very difficult thing to do. But sometimes, a measured trill, there is a place for that. </p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>What are the most controversial things about playing Bach?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>I think the issue of timing, of rubato. I've had so many comments about that. In Singapore, the head piano teacher at the Conservatory came to me and said, \"You don't know what a great gift you've given us. The attitude here is that Bach has to be strict and unbending and rigid and you can't take any time, and yours was so wonderful and free and expressive and singing. It's just been a revelation.\" </p> <p>If there's one thing I can get across to people is that Bach does not have to be rigid and strict and that taking time is allowed. Of course, it has to be done intelligently. Usually it's used to highlight the architecture or the harmonies and not just because you feel like taking a bit of time in that bar. You have to have a reason for it. </p> <p>I also think that using the Fazioli piano has really made a difference too. You can get so many different colours in it, so many tiny variations of colour, of touch, that it's really added so much to my musical imagination.</p> <p>It's funny, when I go back on this tour, to playing with, shall we say, a piano beginning with S, I have to play a lot more, you know, every note. Especially when I'm playing lightly and maybe quick, it has to be much more every note emphasised. I don't like that. It's not how I play anymore. I'm much more tired at the end too. But I think in combination with the Fazioli I've become more creative with my colour and sound and phrasing. </p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Just talk a bit about what it's like living with Bach. </p> <p><strong>AH:</strong> Well, he's a pretty good friend. He's a demanding friend, I tell you! He gives me sore muscles in my neck! But every minute I spend in his company is worthwhile. I don't think that there's any other repertoire that I could have repeated so often as I'm doing on this world tour and absolutely never get tired of it. It's still a challenge. It's still growing. I'm still perfecting it. He is demanding. He demands great discipline and co-ordination and heart. I feel so much that it's worth it. </p> <p>Certainly, all the time you put into learning Bach, it helps you so much with all the other composers afterwards. Things like developing finger legato. So many times in masterclasses kids play Schubert, Beethoven, Chopin, and they have no finger legato at all. All the legato just on the pedal, it's not the same at all. </p> <p>Just being able to play different voices, with different colours, that helps you with Beethoven too. The fluency you get in Bach, you apply to Mozart, Brahms as well. So I know that all the time I spend with Bach will make it easier with other things too.</p> <p>He has been quite demanding. I couldn't have done, as I often say, the complete Bach and had four kids at the same time, no.</p> <p>When I began the tour, I couldn't do all 48 from memory, but soon I took the score away from Book One, and in March, went for the whole thing. But it took me that length of time to really have it all safely in my memory. </p> <p>I think it's a hundred times more work to play from memory than to play with a score. </p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Why does it matter?</p> <p><strong>AH:</strong> A lot of people would say that it doesn't matter, that nobody would care, but it matters to me. Firstly, I feel that the audience's concentration is at a higher pitch when I'm doing it from memory, perhaps because they see the concentration on my face and it's translated to them. Plus there's no fooling with pages between prelude and fugue. And I didn't want anyone else sitting there. You demand so much concentration that you don't even want anyone sitting there, turning the pages.</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> You've been playing this programme for six, seven, eight months. How much does the music continue to reveal itself to you while you're living with it?</p> <p><strong>AH:</strong> Up until a month ago it was changing. I'd find different things to do. I don't think now it's going to change dramatically. Just that it will become more part of me each time, which translates into being more authoritative. </p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> Is part of the pleasure of playing live feeling that you suddenly have a different kind of connection with the audience?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>You're usually hugely influenced by piano and hall and audience, but the two most important things are the piano and the acoustic in the hall. Also the audience. The greatest gift they can give me is silence. I have decided that coughing or not coughing is a matter totally of discipline and respect for the artist and for the music. In Tokyo, there were people with the face masks on who made no noise at all during the whole 48! But in other halls it's just constant and it can drive you crazy. Especially when you're playing fugues. </p> <p>A combination of the audience, the piano and the silence in the hall. That's when you give your best and most colourful performances.</p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>Can Baroque music simultaneously be romantic?</p> <p><strong>AH:</strong> It's not romantic like Schumann, no, but if you use \"romantic\" to mean \"very expressive\", then, yes, I think so. Pieces like the B flat minor prelude, which is very tragic and romantic. Or the Variation 25 of the Goldberg. It's very intense. You can't get much more romantic than that. It's romantic for his time.</p> <p>As a kid, I was often criticised for making things too romantic, but I think what they meant was too expressive.</p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>You mentioned Edwin Fischer. Are there other people of that generation that you get inspiration from?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>Kempff. You know that marvellous record of transcriptions? You want something romantic - that's romantic - Bach. The joy, the sorrow. He came from a family of organists and evidently could transpose any of the 48, which I certainly couldn't do!</p> <p>Who else is there? Gould I listen to, but I could never imitate him. It was too much him, and not enough Bach, for me.</p> <p>Rosalyn Tureck of course, I grew up on \u2013 The Well-Tempered Clavier - although I did always find it a bit lugubrious, not lively enough for me.</p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>Of the 48, what are the ones that you have grown to love most?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>The C sharp minor, Book One, that wonderful fugue. It comes so early on too, you have to be ready for it, but it's marvellous. Oh my God, there are so many! The G minor, from Book Two, which is a real organ fugue, a fantastic prelude too. Book Two is much more demanding on you in a way. </p> <p>Book One is more extrovert, more easily accessible. The preludes in Book Two are much bigger pieces. The fugues in Book Two tend to be more dense, more complicated to understand. Book Two is Bach writing for himself, I feel. </p> <p>The second half of Book Two is the most difficult to make your way through, but it is the richest. You have to save yourself for it. It's the most demanding. </p> <p>Book One we have in manuscript. Book Two we don't. All the copies we had of Book Two were copies his students made and sometimes there are annotations by Bach in the margin, but there are a lot more variants, little tiny variants in notes or ornamentations that he added at a later date. So there are more decisions to make about textual things.</p> <p><strong>AR:</strong> What's the secret of pedalling Bach? </p> <p><strong>AH:</strong> What's the secret? The secret is to figure it out with the fingers first \u2013 is to do all the articulation, all legato, whatever you want to do, do it all with the fingers first and then bring in the pedal if there's something you really can't join and want to have joined. That's the secret, I think, to use it only when required. How beautiful it can sound without pedal in the B flat minor. It's very difficult to do and takes great, great control. </p> <p>In a drier hall, I would use a little bit more pedal, but never to blur a passage. For instance, at the end of Book One, the big B minor fugue, I might use it on every sixteenth note. I would pedal each note to give it a bit more resonance. </p> <p>Soft pedal can be very useful. On the Steinway in Singapore it was best to avoid it. But on the Fazioli you can really use it to great effect, to get just a little bit more. Or you could use the fourth pedal too, if you like, if you're playing something very rapid. On the 308, and also on my [Fazioli model] 278, he puts on a fourth pedal. It lowers the keyboard and at the same time the hammer comes closer to the keys so you don't get so much attack. For Beethoven I use it, you know the end of Opus 10, No. 2? You put that fourth pedal down and it's a breeze.</p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>What is it about the Fazioli that you've come to love so much?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>It's the response. It's the clarity. It lives under my fingers. I think that's the main thing. I hold those long chords in the D major fugue \u2013 and I hold and hold and hold that chord because of the resonance and the harmonics. On other pianos you don't want to hold it that long because it sounds flat, but not on the Fazioli. I really do notice the difference in my muscles when I have to play Steinway rather than Fazioli. I'm much more tired physically with Steinway than I am with a Fazioli.</p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>What are the mistakes that pianists make when they play Bach, in your view?</p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>Lack of colour. They just play it all too much on the same level. When they play a six-page fugue and it's all on the same level it's awful! It's terrible. </p> <p><strong>AR: </strong>How much do you bring out individual voices? </p> <p><strong>AH: </strong>One of the true trademarks of a good Bach player is that you can do that. You should be able to play any passage in Bach in as many different ways as there are voices. To think horizontally. Everybody thinks vertically in Bach. I try to always think horizontally.</p> <p>\u00b7 Angela Hewitt's DVD, <a href=\"http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=DVDA68001\">Bach Performance on the Piano: An Illustrated Lecture</a>, is out now from Hyperion</p>",
  "<p>Norrebro, the neighbourhood in Copenhagen where I grew up, has for years been plagued by criminal youth gangs whose members are increasingly drawn from the Turkish, Pakistani, and Palestinian communities. </p> <p>It wasn't always like this; indeed Norrebro used to be seen as an example of how integration in Denmark was working \u2013 but that's not the case any more. As competition for the lucrative drug trade has increased, there is a sense of fear and mistrust between the communities and integration is non-existent. </p> <p>To exacerbate matters, for weeks Copenhagen has witnessed an intensifying war between the notorious motorcycle group, Hells Angels, and the drug gangs. Bullets have flown and many residents are abandoning the troubled area. </p> <p>Compounding the drug turf wars is a nasty streak of racism. The Hells Angels are currently recruiting prospects to \"rid Denmark of the Muslim menace\". Meanwhile, their opponents are seeking new members to \"eliminate those who want to eliminate us\". </p> <p>A network of violent gangs is operating around town, directly targeting the \"fortresses\" where Hells Angels hang out. The Angels' <a href=\"http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article569114.ece\"> response </a> is typically unrestrained: \"Hells Angels are a motorcycle club that bothers no one, but if someone steps on our toes we'll stamp back with a vengeance,\" they said on a website. </p> <p>Despite these claims, the Angels are no angels. For years they fought an armed war with another motorcycle gang, the Bandidos, vying for control of Copenhagen's criminal markets. Scores of dead later, the conflict cooled down. </p> <p>If the original motorcycle gangs consisted of misfits, this is even more true of their new enemies. Isolated from society, these kids' only claim to self-esteem is violence. Several well-meaning local groups and individuals have tried to reach out to these youngsters, but all attempts have failed and many of those who tried have had to move out of the neighbourhood, fearing for their personal safety.</p> <p>Copenhagen and Denmark has turned into a hotspot for racial tension. Immigration is the single most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/04/denmarklosestolerance\">populist political issue</a>. Affluent Denmark has dramatically failed when it comes to integration. With Europe's most stringent immigration laws, an insistence on monoculture and assimilation, the once-pragmatic Danes have increasingly isolated themselves. </p> <p>The famous Danish photographer, Jacob Holdt, who in the 1970s documented racism in the US and said in today's Politiken newspaper: \"Denmark is today more racist than America.\"</p> <p>Frightening indeed, and a largely self-created problem. The current centre-right government \u2013 supported by the nationalistic and right wing Danish Peoples party \u2013 has since 2001 marginalised and stereotyped immigrants. </p> <p>The troubles on the streets of Norrebro can be traced back to that approach. This is not to defend or excuse the community's violent response \u2013 parts of the area are now a total no-go area and even the Danish Broadcasting Corporation is staying away from certain trouble spots as journalists have been threatened with beatings if they film in the area.</p> <p>How did it come to this? Denmark has been through a decade of years of unprecedented economic growth. Our society is much fairer than the British with far fewer class divisions. As we say in Danish: \"Why didn't we fix the roof while the sun was shining?\"</p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, is that there was no will to do so. An unwelcoming host will usually find he has impolite guests. This is the case in Copenhagen right now and it is hard to see how things will change.</p>",
  "<p>Stan Kroenke, the American entrepreneur who owns 12.4% of the club's shares, has joined the Arsenal board as a non-executive director. Kroenke's accession to the Emirates Stadium boardroom will be widely seen as an attempt by the existing hierarchy to strengthen their position against a possible future takeover by Alisher Usmanov, the Russian billionaire who is the club's largest shareholder.</p> <p>\"Mr Kroenke fully supports the approach the board has taken in setting the direction of the club,\" said the Arsenal chairman, Peter Hill-Wood. \"The board believes Mr Kroenke's experience in sports team commercial management, sports marketing, media and new media rights as well as real estate development will be of great value.\"</p> <p>Kroenke's appointment amounts to a major <em>volte face</em> by Hill-Wood, who caustically remarked that \"we don't want his sort\" when the American sought to increase his stake in the club last year. Kroenke is not a party to the \"lock-down\" agreement governing the sale of shares by directors, but his apparent willingness to toe the boardroom line - combined with concern over the uncertain intentions of Usmanov - has paved the way for a thawing of relations.</p> <p>\"It is a real honour to be invited to join the Board of Arsenal given its pre-eminent reputation and position in football world-wide,\" said Kroenke. \"I hope that my background in sports management will be an asset to Arsenal in its commercial dealings going forward.\"</p> <p>Kroenke's promotion means that board members now speak for around 60 per cent of the club's overall shareholdings. </p> <p>The American's increased involvement coincides with the publication of annual accounts which reveal the club to be in robust financial health. Arsenal recorded a pre-tax profit of \u00a336.7m for the year ending May 2008, the second highest in club history, and brought in \u00a394.6m in gate and match day receipts.</p> <p>\"The club is ambitious for success and I believe that the strong financial position provides the best possible platform from which to deliver that success for the long-term,\" Hill-Wood added. \"Over the last two seasons Emirates Stadium has taken our football revenues to a new level, but we cannot be complacent. We moved in order to compete with top European sides, not only on a financial footing but from a footballing perspective.\"</p> <p>The club's financial prosperity is likely to place a renewed emphasis on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's thrifty transfer dealings. Although shareholder Danny Fiszman recently claimed that Wenger would be backed to the tune of \u00a330m for a single player should he so wish, the Arsenal manager made few demands on the club's coffers this summer, effectively offsetting the \u00a312.5m acquisition of Samir Nasri through the sales of Alexander Hleb, Gilberto Silva and Justin Hoyte.</p>",
  "<p>After some of the most turbulent trading days experienced by Wall Street in a generation, the latest list of America's top 400 richest people produced by the business magazine Forbes looks like a window into a bygone world.</p> <p>The Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, still tops the list with a net worth of $57bn (\u00a331.7bn). But how safe is the second-place position of the famous investor Warren Buffett - his $50bn fortune has dropped $12bn in six months - since the list was compiled at close of play on August 29?</p> <p>Since then the Dow Jones has dropped more than 800 points in just four days, Lehman Brothers became the world's largest ever bankrupt, Merrill Lynch was forced into a shotgun wedding with Bank of America, AIG was bailed out by the US government and Morgan Stanley is on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>AIG's woes earlier in the year had already pushed one of the insurance group's major shareholders, Eli Broad, down to No 48 on the list with an estimated wealth of $6.7bn. A well-known philanthropist, he sold his SunAmerica business to AIG and the proceeds have helped not only his adoptive city of Los Angeles but the nation's art dealers. He owns the world's largest collection of works by Jeff Koons and once bought a painting by Roy Lichtenstein for $2.5m using a credit card. The government bailout of AIG, however, will have significantly hit his wallet since the Forbes 400 list was compiled.</p> <p>It is unlikely that art will retain its value in the current slump, despite the record-breaking Damien Hirst sale earlier this week.

The position of fellow Citigroup shareholder Gerald Ford - who sold Golden State Bankcorp in 2002 for $6bn to the bank, and is listed at No 355 with $1.4bn - also looks rocky.</p> <p>Back among the big hitters, Wall Street's crash and the demise of Lehman Brothers will have hit the $15bn fortune of 15th-placed Abigail Johnson.

Her father Edward is placed at No 28 with $11bn and is level-pegging with George Soros.</p> <p>Soros ranks highest among those in the Fortune 400 whose wealth comes from hedge funds and private equity and it is unlikely that all the other 23 in the list who have made their money the same way will be there in a year's time.</p> <p>The Bridgewater Associates boss, Ray Dalio, is ranked at No 78 with a fortune estimated at $4.5bn, while the Och-Ziff hedge fund co-founder Daniel Och is at No 95 on $3.9bn. Also at No 78 is John Paulson, who has made millions for his funds over the past year by betting against sub-prime assets. The firm's Credit Opportunities fund was up 590% net of fees last year. </p> <p>As well as wiping out billions in paper fortunes as share prices collapse, and perhaps raising billions more for shrewd investors, the impact of the turmoil in the banking sector is likely to hit other industries.</p> <p>Particularly vulnerable is Michael Bloomberg, who sits in eighth position with a $20bn fortune. The collapses and mergers in the financial industry are likely to significantly reduce demand for the news and trading terminals that bear his name.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page come in at 13 and 14 with $15.9bn and $15.8bn respectively. Lawrence 'Larry' Ellison, the boss of the software company Oracle, comes in third at $27bn, while spaces four, five and six are taken up with the Wal-Mart dynasty who together control more than 39% of the grocery chain, which owns Asda in the UK. Jim Walton, the son of the supermarket giant's pioneer Sam Walton, comes in fourth at $23.4bn; his elder brother and the company's chairman, Robson Walton is in fifth on $23.3bn, and their sister Alice is joint sixth with $23.2bn with the widow of her other brother John, Christy Walton, and her family.</p> <p>Finally, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg can afford a wry smile. He is the youngest member of the Forbes 400 thanks to the $15bn valuation placed on the social networking site when Microsoft took its 1.6% stake last year. His $1.5bn fortune puts him at number 321. At the time he was being pushed to float the business, which he set up four years ago. If he had, it would now be buffeted by the current market turmoil and it is unlikely he would have the minimum $1.3bn fortune needed for inclusion.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.cambridgeesol.org/\">Cambridge Esol</a>, the UK-based exam board responsible for globally popular English language assessment tests such as First Certificate and Ielts, has made a virtue of the slow pace at which it embraces change. Aware of the need to maintain users' confidence, Cambridge prefers to make sure that it has done its homework thoroughly before it turns the page on something new.</p> <p>This is certainly the case with the launch of the new version of its diploma-level qualification for experienced teachers. This month the old \"DELTA\" will be replaced by the new \"Delta\". The shift from the diploma's old acronym to new brand name is but a small detail in a major overhaul that has been three years in development. For teachers frustrated by the limitations of the old qualification, the Delta is likely to be good news.</p> <p>Nick Charge, examinations manager at Cambridge Esol, says the exam board became aware that the old diploma needed updating back in 2005. Already a decade old, the content of the syllabus had not kept up with changes going on in the classroom, most significantly the widespread use of new technology.</p> <p>Cambridge were also aware that the course of study required to complete the DELTA was becoming increasingly burdensome for teachers who could not afford to take three months off work for full-time study or six months for part-time. Not only was that time-scale fixed but candidates risked having to retake the whole qualification if they failed one part \u2013 with course fees ranging from $4,000 to $6,000, no small consideration.</p> <p>\"Our research showed that DELTA had become a monolithic qualification,\" says Charge, but it also showed that candidates were trying to adapt it to better suit their needs.</p> <p>\"We were finding that teachers were trying to modularise the DELTA themselves by opting for deferrals. The message was that the old DELTA was just too much of an ask for teachers. The need to move to a modular syllabus was clear from early on.\"</p> <p>The result is not just a qualification that is broken up into three distinct modules, which can be taken in any order and at any time, but also a rewriting of the syllabus to allow candidates to draw on a much wider range of teaching experiences.</p> <p>Module One serves to consolidate the core knowledge about teaching and learning that a teacher with at least two years' experience (the minimum requirement) should have. The module's seven units cover the theories behind how people learn languages and how they are taught and it is assessed by a written exam.</p> <p>Module Two shifts the emphasis to practical skills and to acquiring and applying new knowledge in different contexts. This is where candidates are likely to learn new things and, by passing this module, prove to employers that they are ready to take on greater responsibility, both in class and in management roles.</p> <p>Candidates will need to follow Module Two on a supervised course. To pass they will need to submit a portfolio of course work, including observed lessons, background written assignments and an externally assessed lesson observation.</p> <p>Module three is a further break from the old format. Here candidates are invited to chose a specialisation and then, in a detailed written assignment, explore how they would go about planning, designing and assessing a language course. Whereas in the past the written assignment was based on a single student profile, now candidates can chose from across the ELT spectrum. Both Modules One and Three can be taken independently without needing to enrol on a formal course.</p> <p>Cambridge unveiled the new-format Delta 12 months ago and Charge says the response from training providers has been mixed. Many are continuing to offer extended full- or part-time courses, delivering the new Delta syllabus in a similar way to the old DELTA. But there are signs the flexibility offered by the modular framework is starting to be explored.</p> <p>This month <a href=\"http://www.bell-centres.com//teachers/cambridgeesol/delta.asp\">Bell</a>, the leading UK-based ELT provider, launched a new Delta course that offers Module Two as either a five-week face-to-face course or a 12-week blended learning course (mixing online and face-to-face delivery). Courses covering Modules One and Three are delivered online.</p> <p>Charge says teacher training institutions have shown interest in incorporating one or more modules into their existing syllabuses. To date the majority of candidates have been \"native-English-speaker\" teachers, but Charge hopes that more \"non-native\" teachers will encounter the Delta through their local training and think about taking on the full qualification.</p> <p>Charge also expects the Delta to have greater appeal for employers. \"Allowing people to accrue the Delta over time makes much more sense. In the past it was all or nothing and that wasn't helpful to employers.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Click here for more information about <a href=\"http://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/teaching-awards/delta.html\">Cambridge Esol's new Delta</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission broke its promise to improve the protection of animals used in research once again this week when it pulled out of publishing its proposal for the revision of 20-year-old animal testing rules. </p> <p>Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used in experiments has power of life and death over animals used in European laboratories. Its revision is a once-in-a-generation chance to lead progress away from animal experimentation and towards more reliable, humane alternatives.</p> <p>The process of revising the directive began nearly six years ago, when a specially commissioned <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/evans_report.pdf\"> report (pdf)</a> by the EC environment directive stated that: \"It has come to light that there are several shortcomings in the way that animals are being cared for while subject to experimentation. Although voluntary guidelines exist on the education and training of persons working with laboratory animals, there is currently no EU-wide standard course that can be followed. A recent report compiled by the <a href=\"http://www.buav.org/\">British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection</a> based on an<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgkgwfahfiw\"> undercover investigation</a> on Cambridge University that revealed a catalogue of animal suffering. That this could happen in the country which is often cited as having the most stringent welfare legislation is lamentable evidence of the shortcomings of the way in which Directive 86/609 is implemented and enforced.\"</p> <p>Despite recognition of such suffering, and the subsequent acknowledgment that urgent action is needed, the commission has repeatedly delayed the adoption of its proposal. It publicly announced last Friday that the proposal would be adopted this week. However, during the two working days between the announcement and scheduled adoption, the item was removed from the official agenda.</p> <p>Over 12 million animals are used in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/reports_en.htm\">experiments in Europe every year</a>, and the numbers are continuing to rise. The commission clearly agrees the existing directive is failing to protect animals and is not bringing about a reduction in their use. In the 21st century, Europe has a responsibility to do better, especially as its citizens have clearly expressed their concern and strongly support the need for change.</p> <p>The majority of people in the UK want to live in a world where nobody wants or believes we need to experiment on animals, according to an independent survey carried out by research group <a href=\"http://www.nfpsynergy.com\">NFP Synergy</a> on behalf of the BUAV. Meanwhile, in one of the largest ever responses, to a commission public consultation the majority said they felt more needed to be done to replace the use of animals and that the budget to find and regulate alternatives must be vastly increased.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eceae.org\">The European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE)</a> \u2013 a coalition of animal protection groups across the EU of which BUAV is a member and of which I am chief executive \u2013 has worked hard to persuade MEPs and other European decision-makers that the time is right for an ambitious and humane new law that begins to fundamentally change the way animals are used in research in the European Union.</p> <p>Following the latest setback the ECEAE has this week written to commissioner Dimas expressing its concern and deep disappointment that the process has yet again been delayed. We are calling for the commission to confirm that the proposed revision of the directive will be adopted and published immediately. It is now crucial that concerned MEPs follow Green <a href=\"http://www.carolinelucasmep.org.uk/2008/09/17/euro-commission-decision-%e2%80%98will-block-better-animal-protection-standards%e2%80%99-warns-green-mep\">Caroline Lucas's</a> example and also put pressure on the commission to publish \u2013 the BUAV and its sister organisations across Europe stand ready to assist MEPs and others who want to take such action.</p> <p>It is widely expected the proposals will include measures to ban the use of wild-caught primates and great apes in experiments, responding to public concern and formalising the position across the EU where the use of our closest living relatives has already been phased out. If the new law is to be fit for the 21st century, however, it must absolutely emphasise the replacement of all animals as a primary moral imperative. This must be secured through binding and mandatory targets to reducing animal use and finding and using humane alternatives. </p> <p>Good intentions are not enough. The change EU citizens wish to see will only come from a transparent system which, as a bare minimum, strongly interrogates the benefit the research is expected to deliver against the suffering caused to the animals involved, and then lays such decision-making open to public scrutiny. </p> <p>It is imperative that European institutions reflect the views of citizens by enshrining in law the principle that research using live animals, no longer has a place in a civilised 21st century Europe. Animals have suffered in EU labs without real protection for long enough. Everyone acknowledges that change is long overdue, EU citizens expect, need and deserve more modern humane research. The time to legislate is now.</p> <p><em>Michelle Thew is the chief executive of the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments, a coalition of animal protection groups across Europe.</em></p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year a group of students from Dubai and South Korea found themselves hovering over a series of platforms suspended over a tranquil sea. When they saw some friends they wanted to talk to in English they landed and started to pick up on conversations and ask questions. These encounters were not taking place in a dream but were part of an innovative language exchange project in the virtual, online world of <a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a>.</p> <p>Second Life is a 3D computer- generated world that spreads over tens of thousands of virtual square kilo metres. This territory is being explored, built on and lived in by up to 15 million users. What began in 2003 as an experiment in online social networking in which users create a virtual alter ego \u2013 or 3D avatar \u2013 has given life to a society and economy that has made virtual millionaires out of some. It has also attracted the interest of real-world big business.</p> <p>Second Life users can speak and listen to each other via their computer-controlled avatars. The potential for language learning was spotted very early on. What started with informal meetings between users to offer practice in each other's languages has developed into established language courses, taught by avatar instructors, while virtual versions of real-world educational institutions have opened their doors to students.</p> <p>Last April the <a href=\"http://dwc.hct.ac.ae/dwcweb/index.php\">Dubai Women's College</a> (DWC), a leading Gulf state higher education institution, opened a version of its campus on Second Life. Among the first users were second-year students led by their English language teacher, Nicole Shammas. The language exchange that resulted has convinced Shammas and her colleagues that introducing students to a virtual world can be rewarding.</p> <p>Shammas is from New Zealand and has been providing language support to DWC's students, who are taught in English, for a decade. She admits that she was a novice in e-learning when the opportunity to use the Second Life campus came up. Her aim was to develop the communication skills of her students who were mostly from conservative family backgrounds and needed English language skills to operate in a global business environment.</p> <p>Shammas had contacts in South Korea and she was introduced to Chris Surridge, a Canadian, who was doing similar English-language support teaching at the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.kaist.edu/edu.html\">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> (Kaist) in Seoul. Surridge had been using computer-assisted language learning resources for more than a decade and his students were already highly digitally literate. But like the DWA class, they needed to develop their English.</p> <p>The pair started to pool their ideas and came up with a curriculum that would develop not just English and IT skills but \"soft skills\" such as teamwork and leadership.</p> <p>They agreed that the culmination of the project would be interaction on Second Life, but for that meeting to be successful they had to develop the two groups' interest in each other. Their solution was to develop contact over seven weeks, starting with the exchange of recordings of students posing and answering questions about each other. Next they made short videos about their respective campuses and lives. They then sent each other \"culture capsules\" that contained everyday items and arranged to open them together while they were linked via a video conference. Only then did they meet up in a private area of the DWC Second Life campus.</p> <p>\"It was essential at every point that we had strong motivation for each stage of the programme,\" says Surridge. \"Before students recorded their questions for the first stage, for example, they brainstormed.\"</p> <p>When the students met via the video link to open their capsules, they had practised introductions and questions. Shammas's students had sent a traditional Gulf headdress and explained to the Kaist students how to tie it. \"Chris and I pushed the conversation along, but trying on the dishdasha via video link got everyone involved and the conversation was really student-led,\" says Shammas.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Shammas had been preparing her group for Second Life by identifying students who already knew how to create an avatar and move around, and asking them to act as trainers. They then explored and discussed the social behaviour in Second Life's multicultural environment and the language they would need to deal with it. In groups they sought out locations where they were safe from harassment and put their avatars through their paces by learning new skills such as skiing.</p> <p>\"It was interesting for me to see how the 'first life' values and beliefs of these 19-to-20-year-old Muslim women transferred \u2013 or didn't \u2013 into their Second Life,\" says Shammas.</p> <p>\"All my students wear the veil, yet all chose not to in Second Life. My students don't talk to men they don't know, and this was something that carried over on to Second Life. When they were approached by a stranger they politely declined to talk. With the Korean students they were a lot more open but many preferred interacting in groups rather than one-on-one.\"</p> <p>The final stage was a week-long meeting between the two groups in Second Life. Shammas and Surridge had decided to keep the communication text-based but encouraged the students to be as conversational as possible. The teachers observed the meetings and recorded transcripts, which they intended to analyse in the classroom later.</p> <p>\"By the time we met in Second Life our students were highly motivated to meet and very curious about each other,\" says Shammas.</p> <p>Achieving that motivation while using a range of technology was a mark of the project's success, adds Surridge. \"When I see my students eagerly logging in to check their audio forum messages or frantically typing to keep up with a chat session, I know that we are doing something genuine and meaningful,\" he says.</p> <p>Next month the two teachers are going to repeat the exercise with new groups of students, this time using voice communication when they meet in Second Life.</p> <p>\u2022 To learn more about the International Virtual Exchange project <a href=\"mailto:nicole.shammas@hct.ac.ae\">contact Nicole Shammas</a>.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>The morning foursomes in one word:</strong> Bah.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The afternoon fourballs line up like this, and it means Oliver Wilson is the only player on either side not to get a run-out today:</strong><br>Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim v Padraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell<br>Steve Stricker and Ben Curtis v Ian Poulter and Justin Rose<br>Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan v Sergio Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez<br>JB Holmes and Boo Weekley v Lee Westwood and Soren Hansen</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The afternoon fourballs begin at:</strong> 5.45pm. Which is BST, three letters I'll not be typing successively in caps again this session. If you're from America, you do the mathS.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>5.50pm:</strong> Actually I'm not sure they are starting the fourballs at 5.45pm. I'll keep you posted the minute I know what's going on, which is admittedly not a cast-iron guarantee of anything.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>5. 55pm: \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first day's afternoon matches of the 37th Ryder Cup.\"</strong> Padriag Harrington's the first to drive off, and creams one straight down the middle, as does Graeme McDowell. Anthony Kim, who had a thundering nervous breakdown on the outward stretch this morning only to come good on the back nine, hits a nice-ish drive which just skips into the semi down the right, while Lefty wings a dreadful drive into the trees.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Six o'clock and all's far from well, from a European point of view.</strong> The Americans were brilliant this morning, especially Mickelson and Kim, who turned his game around brilliantly after not bothering with a backswing for about 12 holes. Now he's just pinged his second at the 1st to ten feet or so, a gilt-edged birdie opportunity. Mickelson is on the green as well. Coverage of this might be a tad bitty for a while, as Perry and Furyk, who were dormie two, have lost 17 and look likely to lose the last, gifting Garcia and Westwood half a point. You can follow that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf6\">here</a> though I'll probably mention it as well.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6.07pm:</strong> McDowell, playing his first hole in Ryder Cup competition, has knocked his second to six feet. Which is just as well, because Mickelson drains a 20-footer to birdie the 1st. Not sure where Harrington is, so let's assume McDowell needs to knock his in for a half. Yes, let's do that.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6.10pm:</strong> Heh. Harrington was between 15-20 feet away from the cup near the front of the green, and he rolls his putt in without fuss. He really is a fantastic golfer; Robert Karlsson wants shooting for his dismal display alongside him this morning, which cost Europe a full point.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6.15pm: THE FINAL FOURSOME HAS FINISHED.</strong> Perry and Furyk drive away from the 18th green, zig-zagging in their comedy car. Two down with two to play, Sergio and Westwood have done wonderfully well to get something out of that game, though the Americans were the architects of their own downfall. <strong>LATEST SCORE: United States 3-1 Europe.</strong></p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6.25pm:</strong> They've not been showing any action. What they're doing is displaying the pairings using footage of each man ambling forwards in super-slo mo. It's utterly preposterous. The way they've shot it, in super-high high def, you can see every single little flap of clothing, and ripple of muscle, as the players close in on the camera. It's quite disturbing. It's probably just as well Monty wasn't picked, it would have been like watching a Russ Meyer movie.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6.30pm:</strong> Here, without bothering to show how we got there, Kim has just rattled a ten-footer past the hole. It seems it was for a half, which puts Harrington and McDowell one up after two. Less high-definition shots of the pleats in Boo Weekely's trousers, more action, please, Sky. Is that really too much to ask?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6.40pm: BALLS TO SKY. They're not showing any effing golf! This is ridiculous.</strong> So in lieu of what's going on in golf's premium event, here's Boo Weekley's description of the time he boxed an orangutan.</p> <p>\"One Friday night when I was 16, a bunch of us went to the county fair. A truck pulled in there, sort of away from the midway, and we watched a guy get out and put together a big cage he had in the bed of the truck. After he got the cage together, he put up a little table. Then he went to the cab of the truck and brings out an orangutan. He starts yelling: 'Five to win fifty! Who can beat the orangutan? Pay $5 to try and get $50 if you can whip him!'</p> <p>\"We'd never seen anything like that before. We decided that one of us had to try, and I drew the short straw. Five of us put up a buck each, and I gave the guy with the truck $5. Before helping me into the boxing gloves and headgear, he made me sign a waiver. Looking back, that was a bad sign.</p> <p>\"I got in the ring. The orangutan didn't look like much. He came up about to my chest, though his arms were as long as he was tall. When the match started, he didn't lift his arms. He kept them down at his side and used them to pivot and follow me as I circled him like Muhammad Ali. I just didn't see how I could miss. My strategy was to fake with my right hand, and when the orangutan tried to block the punch, I'd throw my left.</p> <p>\"My buddies were going wild. 'Get him, Boo! Kick his butt!' They really wanted that $50. I moved in close and faked with my right, and that's the last thing I remember. I woke up bleeding in the back of a friend's pickup. The orangutan had knocked me cold with one punch, which I didn't even see coming. My friends thought it was hilarious. They said I had a glass jaw and called me Glassy the rest of the night.\"</p> <p>There is a joke about cruelty to dumb animals in there somewhere, quite near the surface, but I can't bring myself to make it. Also worth noting is the fact his friends only riffed on his pain for \"the rest of the night\", which suggests even more outlandish things happened to Mr Weekley and his pals as a matter of course.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> After wasting a whole load of time showing some \"stunning views from the air\", Sky finally get their house in order. Harrington has birdied the 3rd to put Europe two up in the first match of the afternoon. He's followed it up by peppering the flag at 4, though his excellent approach, ten feet away, isn't half as good as McDowell's. Which I guess means McDowell should technically be five feet from the hole, but he's probably six to eight feet away. So sue me!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6.50pm:</strong> Jiminez then Garcia both cream their opening drives of the third match. Mahan's drive is probably the best of the four here, as Leonard slices is into deep filth. Up at the 4th, Mickelson sends a wedge in to about 12 feet, with Kim about 20 feet away from the pin.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6.53pm:</strong> Neither Mickelson nor Kim can make their birdie putts on 4. Europe have two chances to take the hole, and only need one, Harrington rolling his putt right into the centre of the cup. He is now three up after four, with the added bonus that, unlike this morning when he was also three up against the same opposition, he's playing with McDowell and doesn't have Karlsson dragging him down.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6.55pm:</strong> Garcia's approach to the 1st is very unlucky, holding the back-left corner of the green awhile before teetering on the edge and eventually toppling down the mack. Mahan's iron into the green teeters on the apron at the front and looks like toppling back into the bunker on the right, but stops before disaster strikes.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> \"Rose drains a beauty from 15 feet on the 2nd to salvage a half with a birdie.\" That's what I'd written, with Stricker five feet from the hole in two. But what a swing: seconds ago it looked like Europe would be a hole down, now they're a hole up as Stricker misses a pathetically short dribbler. It wasn't quite up there with Craig Stadler in 1985, but dear me. Europe one up after two there.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> Better news for the Americans on the 1st. Garcia so nearly chips in for birdie, but Mahan rolls in his effort to take the spoils. USA one up in that match. The final pairings are preparing to be about their business.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> Everyone makes a large song and dance about reaching the 5th green with simple approaches, bar Mickelson who strokes in a 12-foot putt to peg Harrington and McDowell back; the States are now only two down. They're going to come back again, aren't they. This was always on: being hot favourites simply doesn't suit the Europeans. I knew something didn't feel right.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>7.13pm:</strong> Westwood plays his second into the 1st green. It bounces on the apron behind the bunker on the right and bounces left, 20 feet from the hole. That's lovely. \"Great shawt Hansen,\" shouts an American supporter from the crowd. Maybe she's a psychic, because Hansen then steps up and sends his shot to ten feet. This is golf, right here. And then Holmes hits one to five or six feet: fantastic! Not sure what happened to Weekley, maybe he's run off to wrestle an alligator.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Weekley's secured a four for the US on the front, chipping to a foot from Garcia country. Westwood pretty much does the same, though the American's aren't conceding his four footer yet. Meanwhile, what a shot from Kim on the 6th: he fires in a long iron which rolls right to the back of the green - then trundles back down towards the hole, stopping about an inch from the cup. That's up there as shot of the day with Mickelson's flop shot on 14.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>7.20pm:</strong> Hansen misses his birdie op on the 1st, but Holmes makes no mistake: the States go one up there. And Mahan makes his second birdie in a row at the 2nd, but Jimenez knocks in a 15-footer which pirhouettes 360 degrees round the lip before falling in.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>7.28pm:</strong> Some news I forgot to tell you about: Stricker made up for his miss on 2nd with a birdie on 3 to level the second match. Kim's spectacular at 6 is good enough to reduce Harrington and McDowell's lead to one hole. Rose and Stricker trade birdie putts on 4; it's as you were there.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>7.30pm scoreboard</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 1 UP (6)<br>Stricker/Curtis A/S Poulter/Rose (4)<br>Leonard/Mahan 1 UP v Garcia/Jimenez (2)<br>Holmes/Weekley 1 UP v Westwood/Hansen (1)</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>7.32pm:</strong> Leonard nearly holes in one at 3. He's about an inch from the hole; that's a gimme two. Garcia nearly holes a snaking putt from 25 feet - he's so unlucky that it doesn't drop, from a tricky position at the back of the green - but it's not enough to save the hole. They're two down through three. This is turning into a very poor day for the Europeans.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>7.37pm:</strong> McDowell gives himself a putt for an eagle at the par-five 7th. Maybe this will steady the rocking European boat. Eh, no: Harrington puts his effort in the drink. At the second, everyone is peppering the pin. It is truly ridiculous, they're all about eight feet from the pin. Superb golf, and a halved hole I'm saying.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>7.40pm:</strong> It wasn't: Weekley missed a five-footer on the left - which was hardly a surprise, as his shoulders were pointing at ten-to-five - while Westwood strokes his effort in.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>7.43pm:</strong> McDowell can't make his eagle putt but his birdie is a shoo-in. But after a delicious chip to four feet, Kim halves the four with ease. After seven, Harrington and McDowell remain one up.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>7.45pm:</strong> This is staunch work from Jimenez. Leonard knocks a 25-footer up the hill for yet another bloody birdie, but the Spaniard strokes in a left-to-right curler down the hill from 12 feet. That's a wonderful response, and it stops the US pair going three up.</p> <p><strong>As things stand...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 1UP (7)<br>Stricker/Curtis A/S Poulter/Rose (4)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2 UP v Garcia/Jimenez (4)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen (2)</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>7.50pm:</strong> McDowell has just knocked in a 30-footer from the back-left corner of the 8th green for a birdie two. Kim has a 25-foot right-to-left putt himself, from the other side of the dancefloor, and it only just slips by the left lip. Mickelson is off the green, so this looks like two up for the Europeans.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>7.52pm:</strong> Mickelson tries to thin a chip into the cup, almost like a putt, but it was never going in. Europe two up.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>7.55pm:</strong> What a shot from Leonard, who creams a four iron from the right-hand side of the fairway into the heart of the green, after bouncing up onto the surface and skirting expertly round the bunker guarding the right-hand side. That is simply outstanding. Jimenez and Mahan play approaches not worth describing, but I will, sort of, the former dumping one in a bunker, the second flying his effort through the green. As for Garcia, his simple seven iron only just holds on the back of the green. This isn't going well for Europe, especially as Leonard is looking supremely confident, especially with the putter.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> Fun and games at the risk-and-reward short par-four 4th: Westwood drives green-high but finds a bunker, Weekley booms one <em>over</em> the green, but a long way left. The former splashes out close and putts out for birdie, the latter manages to find the green from the crowd area then nearly pops in a 15-footer for his birdie. But doesn't. Holmes should save the half but misses his simple birdie opp from six feet; Westwood and Hansen go one up.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>8.10pm:</strong> Poutler and Rose go one up after 6, Stricker and Curtis fannying around in the trees for 15 minutes or so. Meanwhile on 9, after a booming drive Mickelson hits his second to 12 inches. With nobody else anywhere near the hole, expect the Americans to chip Harrington and McDowell's lead away to one hole.</p> <p><strong>As things stand (but not for long, unless something ridiculous happens on the 9th green)...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 2UP (8)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 1UP (6)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2UP v Garcia/Jimenez (5)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 1UP (4)</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>8.15pm:</strong> McDowell nearly makes something ludicrous happen, being a couple of inches away from draining a second 30-footer in a row. He doesn't, though, and Mickelson putts out to take the hole. In fairness to Lefty, it'd run on to about three feet, but it might as well have been three inches for all the difference it made. Mickelson and Kim trail by only one hole now. That's a rollercoaster of a game: only two holes over the front nine were halved. This is the Ryder Cup, right here.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>8.25pm:</strong> Westwood has just drained a 15 footer on 5 to put Europe two up in that match. Holmes had just missed a putt from a similar distance, not giving it enough to reach the hole. He'll be sick about that now, having hit it dead straight. Leonard and Mahan remain two up on Garcia and Jimenez after sharing the spoils on 6.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>As things stand at 8.28pm...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 1UP (9)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 1UP (6)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2UP v Garcia/Jimenez (6)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 2UP (5)</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>8.30pm:</strong> Poulter nails the 29th birdie of the afternoon to move Rose and himself two up on Stricker and Curtis. Meanwhile amazing scenes on the 10th green: from the edge of the green, Mickelson sends the ball about five zillion feet in the air with the mother of all flop shots in order to avoid a down slope which is almost certain to take him miles past the hole if he attempts to putt. He doesn't quite make it, landing the ball just before the bottom of the slope, but it's good enough to stop the ball within ten feet. He flayed at that in the manner of a John Daly drive! You really have to see that shot, simply outstanding. Harrington proves his point by putting from nearly the same spot and sending his putt miles past the hole.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>8.35pm:</strong> What a putt from Harrington, who knocks his putt - 15 feet past the hole - straight back into the cup. That was never missing. It was a crucial make, as well, because not only was Mickelson closer thanks to his amazing flop, Kim had nearly drained a length-of-green eagle attempt and only needed to tap in a tiddler to half the hole. Some great golf on that green there, only McDowell failing to offer anything in the way of fireworks.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>8.40pm:</strong> From the split fairway on the risk-and-reward 7th, Mahan finds the drink, so Leonard plays it safe straight down the middle. That puts the Americans on the back foot, especially when Garcia makes the green in two <em>with a seven iron</em>; 600 yards this hole is.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>8.45pm:</strong> Rose has a simple, straight ten-footer on the 8th for the win, but the ball horseshoes out. Pretty unlucky, that. Curtis nails a tricky six-footer to halve the hole. \"Any word on what kind of captain Faldo is proving to be?\" asks Ross Bremner. \"Is he rushing from hole-to-hole, advising on clubs and intimidating the Yanks as Seve used to? Or hanging around with the wives, signing autographs and getting the sandwiches in?\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf1\">A stubborn one</a>, according to Mike Adamson.</p> <p><strong>As we are at 8.45pm...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 1UP (10)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 2UP (8)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2UP v Garcia/Jimenez (6)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 2UP (6)</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> With Mahan out of the game and Leonard faffing around, Garcia is given his eagle putt at 7 to halve USA's lead in that match. Both Mickelson and McDowell rattle long-range birdie chances at the hole at 11, but neither drop; it's still 1up to the Europeans in that match.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>8.55pm:</strong> Anything Garcia can do, Boo can do too. At the seventh, he knocks his second to 12-15 feet for a super eagle chance. The crowd go wild. \"BOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\" They're not quite as vocal 60 seconds later when Hansen replicates his effort, leaving the two balls practically side by side. There's some high-quality golf being played here.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>8.56pm:</strong> \"There's some high-quality golf being played here.\" Having said that, Holmes goes walkabout, snap-hooking his second into what appears to be marshland to the left of the water running down the left-hand side of the hole.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>9.05pm:</strong> Jimenez misses a very makable 15-foot putt at the 8th, spurning the chance to level that match. Poulter hits his second at the 9th to six inches, but it doesn't win the hole as Stricker knocks his to three feet and strokes in the tricky right-to-left tiddler. They remain two down at the turn.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>9.10pm:</strong> Boo Weekley can hit a drive nearly 400 yards, but can't make the ball travel more than 10 of the 15 feet required to complete his eagle putt at 7. Westwood and Hansen, who missed his effort too, remain two up.<br><strong>As things stand at 9.10pm...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 1UP (11)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 2UP (9)<br>Leonard/Mahan 1UP v Garcia/Jimenez (8)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 2UP (7)</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>9.12pm:</strong> Just a fantastic tee shot at 8 by Westwood, who hits the ball to ten feet at the 180-yard par-three. Hansen follows him, hitting one to nine feet. This is really putting the pressure on the US duo of Holmes and Weekley, who after going one up at the first have done bugger all.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>9.15pm: WHAT A PUTT FROM HARRINGTON!</strong> You have no idea how good Mickelson's approach to the 12th green was. A nice easy swing, the ball dropping inches in front of the hole and biting dead, almost teetering on the lip. The birdie putt is conceded, forcing Harrington to knock in a 25-footer. Straight into the middle of the cup, it was never going to deviate from its line. That could be such an important moment in this excellent match.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>9.20pm:</strong> Both Garcia and Jimenez come close to knocking in mid-range curlers on the 9th, but neither drop. Leonard punishes them by wheeching in a tricky 12-footer, and suddenly the USA are two up at the turn in that match. \"Is Rolf Golf playing an 18-hole round of golf in three hours?\" asks Chris Pons. \"Wow, I'd be happy just to get to the 19th in 300 minutes.\" It is the world of cartoon, Chris. Or maybe he dumped his clubs in a hedge after 13. It's been known.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>9.23pm:</strong> Well, neither Holmes nor Weekley could get anywhere near the tee shots of Westwood and Hansen, but no matter: Holmes holes out from 25 feet to send the crowd mad. The Europeans get what they deserve for their tee shots, though, Westwood knocking in his ten-footer without any fuss. He points at the crowd, who were chanting for JB.</p> <p><strong>As things stand at 9.23pm ...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim v Harrington/McDowell 1UP (12)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 2UP (9)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2UP v Garcia/Jimenez (9)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 2UP (8)</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>9.30pm:</strong> Poulter and Rose pepper the flag at 10, Poulter sinking his putt for birdie. Stricker follows him in for the half. But on 13 there's change: Kim wallops a <em>huge</em> drive straight down the middle but fails to send his approach close; he misses the birdie putt. Mickelson meanwhile finds a fairway bunker - then knocks his approach to six feet! The birdie follows quickly: after 13 holes, that match is now all square. This is simply a wonderful tie, though it is beginning to look like Harrington, who had such a dismal time at the K Club in 2006, still can't buy a win in the Ryder Cup.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>9.40pm:</strong> Rose and Stricker share pars at the 11th. Justin Leonard has just sent a wedge at the 10th to ten feet, setting up a wonderful birdie chance. Meanwhile Harrington and McDowell are up against it at 14, all over the place while Kim sends his tee shot 12 feet from the pin. McDowell sends his chip from the apron ten feet past, while Harrington's putt from the front of the green trundles a good six or seven feet by. That takes the pressure off Kim, who rattles his birdie putt straight into the centre of the cup. They were three down at one point; now they're one up after 14. This will hurt Europe unless Harrington and McDowell can stem the flow.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>9.45pm:</strong> This is beginning to turn America's way: Holmes trundles in an eight-footer at 9 to halve Europe's lead in that match.</p> <p><strong>This is where we are now...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim 1 UP v Harrington/McDowell (14)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 2UP (11)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2UP v Garcia/Jimenez (10)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 1UP (9)</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9.50pm:</strong> Leonard and Garcia shared birdies at 10, but 11 isn't looking good for the Europeans, whose approaches are pretty dismal. McDowell sends a decent approach into the heart of the 15th green, which was much needed with Mickelson going to within ten feet. Kim finds the drink, then Harrington sends a beauty in to 12 feet. Mickelson has the easiest birdie opportunity, but Europe have two chances to at least halve the hole.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>9.55pm:</strong> McDowell makes his birdie putt! That could be so crucial for Europe. Mickelson should take his share of a half by knocking in his eight-to-ten footer, but nevertheless that's priceless for McDowell and Harrington, who are running out of holes. Remember: three up at one point Harrington was. Again.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>10pm: IS THIS TURNING EUROPE'S WAY?</strong> Jimenez pulls it out of the fire for Europe at 11; to be honest I'm not sure what the Americans got up to, but after a rather poor tee shot to the edge of the green, and Garcia nowhere, the ponytailed one strokes in a snake-like putt from 25 yards to cut Leonard and Mahan's lead to one hole. And at 15, Mickelson misses his eight-foot putt! Europe win the hole!</p> <p><strong>This is where we are now...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim ALL SQUARE Harrington/McDowell (15)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 2UP (12)<br>Leonard/Mahan 1UP v Garcia/Jimenez (11)<br>Holmes/Weekley v Westwood/Hansen 1UP (9)</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>10.10pm:</strong> At 10, Westwood and Hansen both see long-range birdie chances die a bit in front of the hole, turn at the last, and fail to drop. It's costly, because Boo walks it in from 15 feet. \"BOOOOOOOOO.\" That match is now level. On 16, Mickelson pushes his first into trees on the left, then dumps his second shot into the bunker in front of the green. Harrington meanwhile is down the right - and what a fairway wood he sends into the green! It's not quite up there with his shot at the 17th at Birkdale in this year's Open, but it's none too shabby, staying on the back of the green, 20 feet from an almost-impossible-to-reach pin. It's a real birdie opportunity.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>10.12pm:</strong> Now Kim follows Harrington onto the green with an almost identical shot from an identical position! This is stunning golf, an amazing match. He's a bit further away than Harrington, but if he manages to trundle his putt into the cup, this match will be America's for the taking.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>10.18pm:</strong> At 12, Garcia rolls in a 20-footer for par, but Leonard has the chance of a birdie from 15 feet - and he makes it, to move back to two up. At 16, Mickelson and McDowell both play poor bunker shots; they're pretty much out of this hole. The next two putts, for Kim and Harrington, are crucial.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>10.20pm:</strong> Kim nearly trickles in a 30-foot effort, the ball crawling slowly down the glassy green and nearly being knocked off line by a butterfly! Harrington has a chance to win the hole, and put Europe one up in the match with two to play. But it's a tricky downhill 18-20 yards. A grim Nick Faldo looks on from the side of the green. This is tense.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>10.21pm:</strong> Ah! What a putt by Harrington, who sets it gently down the hill just to the left. There's not much break... in fact there's none at all, because while it looks momentarily like dropping, it fails to turn just before the cup as expected. The ball skids three feet past the hole; there's some work still to be done.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>10.23pm:</strong> Good boy, Padraig! He takes his time - it seems like he's never going to hit it - and strokes the ball home. Kim gets up to his ball and rattles it home with no fuss. The hole is halved; they'll go down 17 all square, so whatever happens this one is going to the death.</p> <p><strong>The scores...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim ALL SQUARE Harrington/McDowell (16)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 2UP (13)<br>Leonard/Mahan 2UP v Garcia/Jimenez (12)<br>Holmes/Weekley ALL SQUARE Westwood/Hansen (11)</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>10.25pm:</strong> What a fantastic downhill right-to-left putt by Poulter on 14, who makes birdie after a decent tee shot into the centre of the green. Poulter and Rose are three up with four to play. Ben Curtis has been worse than useless.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>10.30pm:</strong> Mickelson's driving has fallen to bits: after pushing one into trees at 16, he pulls one into filth at 17. Meanwhile at 13, it's Jimenez v USA, with Garcia having buggered around in the drink. He's got a birdie opportunity, but with both Leonard and Mahan closer after the same number of shots - and his team already two down - this must go in...</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>10.35pm:</strong> ... and it doesn't. Mahan punishes him by sinking a ten-footer and putting his team three up. \"Why have the Americans shown up dressed as the three of diamonds?\" asks Richard O'Hagan. Well, they do have three diamonds on their chests, but they're all in a row down one side. What kind of playing cards do you use? I hope to God, for your own sake, you don't play poker.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>10.37pm:</strong> OK, we're at 17. Harrington finds the centre of the 17th green with his second. Mickelson finds the front. McDowell sticks his second about six inches behind Harrington, so at least Padraig will get a read. But Kim clips his to 12 feet, putting the USA in the box seat at a crucial time.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>10.38pm:</strong> Poulter sends his approach at 15 right at the pin, leaving the ball 15 feet past. It's a great shot - but Curtis, who has been poor all day, clips one to about six feet. That's surely a birdie, and will put Poulter under serious pressure. Meanwhile... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Weekley chips in from the edge of the green at 12.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>10.40pm: WHAT A PUTT BY MICKELSON!</strong> From the edge of the green, Lefty sends the ball out right, letting it curl round and dropping into the cup from 25 feet out. That's a fantastic effort. McDowell and Harrington will have two chances to match that birdie, but things aren't looking good for Europe.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>10.42pm:</strong> How close did McDowell's effort go? Very close. From the opposite end of the green, he sets the ball out wide left, lets it turn back in, and for a moment it looks like it's going to drop. But he hasn't quite hit it, the ball dies, and turns right before it reaches the hole. Can Harrington learn from it? No, he hits it too hard, and the ball doesn't turn at all. They're one up with one to play. Considering Harrington and McDowell were three up at one point, this is very poor. Especially when you factor in what happened this morning.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>10.48pm:</strong> And there's another blow for Europe, as Westwood can't drain a 30-foot effort on 12; Boo's chip has won the spoils there. True to form, Curtis now also has the yips, missing his birdie attempt from five or six yards, but that match is the only shaft of light for the Europeans, who are a bit of a shambles quite frankly.</p> <p><strong>The grim reading for Europe...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim 1 UP v Harrington/McDowell (17)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 3UP (15)<br>Leonard/Mahan 3UP v Garcia/Jimenez (13)<br>Holmes/Weekley 1 UP v Westwood/Hansen (12)</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>10.50pm:</strong> Garcia and Jimenez halve a fuss-free 14th: they're three down with four to play.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>10.55pm:</strong> On the 16th, Poulter has played a lovely mid-iron into the green, allowing the contours to do the work and bouncing his ball in from the right to around 15 feet. This looks like Europe's point.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>10.58pm:</strong> Some classic matchplay stylings on the par-five 18th. After poor drives, Harrington and Kim are both forced to lay up with their second shots, leaving gentle wedges into the green. Mickelson pushes his shot out left, leaving a bunker in between him and the flag: flop shot time, methinks. And McDowell, the only player with a realistic chance of making the green in two, pushes his shot right, into a bloody great bunker. With Kim unlikely to knacker his wedge, if the way he's been playing over the last few holes is any gauge, this is beginning to look like a lost cause for Europe.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>11pm:</strong> Weekley has a 15-foot putt at 13 for a birdie to win the hole; he misses. Hansen and Westwood still need to hole out for a half, though. Things need to start happening for Europe, and quickly, though I don't see where a comeback (today at least) is coming from.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>11.01pm:</strong> It's not coming from Harrington, I can tell you that for nothing! His approach at 17 is piss poor.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>11.02pm:</strong> But the first point of the afternoon is Europe's. Pars are enough for Poulter and Rose to wrap up a 4&amp;2 victory at the 16th. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 3-2 EUROPE.</strong></p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>11.04pm:</strong> I was probably a wee bit harsh on Harrington, whose ball simply didn't bite and spin back. Kim's did, though - nearly all the way off the front of the green! If Harrington had got as much purchase as Kim did, his ball would be stone dead. As it is, he's now a wee bit closer than Kim.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>11.05pm:</strong> This is pretty much it for Garcia and Jimenez, as Leonard chips in from the edge of the green on 15. Unless either Spaniard match his birdie, that is that.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>11.07pm:</strong> On the 18th, all four men are roughly the same distance from the pin, north, south, east and west. Kim goes first from the front of the green: he chips close, but the ball doesn't quite drop. Then Harrington rolls one down from the back, but doesn't quite set it out to the left enough. Jimenez's birdie attempt on 15 meanwhile is no good: Jiminez and Garcia lose 4&amp;3 to Mahan and the frankly excellent Leonard. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 4-2 EUROPE.</strong></p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>11.09pm:</strong> And now McDowell misses his effort: Mickelson and Kim win, two up. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 5-2 EUROPE.</strong> Three up, Europe were.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>11.12pm:</strong> This has been a brilliant day so far for the US: Leonard and Mahan have played fantastically well, Mickelson and Kim equally so though with slightly less consistency. But it seems to be working for Paul Azinger's men. Meanwhile Nick Faldo looks miserable as hell, and no bloody wonder. The fight doesn't quite seem there in the Europeans, although he'll point to Ian Poulter, who has been resolute this afternoon. Here, there's still a match to play, Holmes and Weekley one up on Westwood and Hansen after 13.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>11.15pm: This is the way it is at the moment...</strong><br>Mickelson/Kim 2 UP v Harrington/McDowell (F)<br>Stricker/Curtis v Poulter/Rose 4&amp;2 (F)<br>Leonard/Mahan 4&amp;3 v Garcia/Jimenez (F)<br>Holmes/Weekley 1 UP v Westwood/Hansen (13)</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>11.20pm:</strong> Weekley and Westwood halved the par-three 14th, but things are looking better for Europe on 15, as Hansen plays a beautiful shot into the left-hand side of the green. The ball swings round the banks and rolls about 12 feet from the pin. With Weekley long and Holmes in filth wide left, there's a great chance here to level the match.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>11.30pm:</strong> Forget about Holmes, who thrashes about in some rough up a hill for a while. Weekley however dinks a lovely chip almost dead from the back of the green. The Europeans don't concede it, but he'll not miss that, which is three feet away tops. That means either Westwood or Hansen have to sink their putts. Westwood misses putting up the green, the ball turning away from the hole late on to the right. Hansen is closer, and with a reasonably straight attempt to boot. But he doesn't make it, both Americans coming away with a ridiculous half, considering how they played. This is a very poor show from Europe. Weekley and Holmes are one up with three to play.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>11.45pm:</strong> At 16, Westwood finds the centre of the green with his second. It's a decent shot, but nothing on what comes next: to a chorus of BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOs, Weekly lifts a wedge to about three feet. Holmes has hit a drive over 360 yards, then hooks a wedge - hooks a wedge! - miles wide left and long. That was bloody awful! Still, no matter, that's this hole wrapped up, surely, which will take the match to dormie two, ensuring the States lead 5.5-2.5. The atmosphere at Valhalla is electric, and much of it is down to the antics of Weekley, whose insouciant attitude is going down a storm. He's a star alright. Just don't ask him to fistfight a chimp.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>11.48pm:</strong> Er... hold on, have I spoken too soon? Hansen, who had flown his second shot long, chips in from thick stuff at the back of the green! Weekley doesn't miss his tiddler, of course, but it's no longer going to win the hole. Weekely and Holmes are still only one up.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>11.53pm:</strong> Off the 17th tee, Holmes wallops a drive which must be nearly 380 yards long, and a good 30-40 past the big-hitting Boo. That is preposterous! How much good it will do him, given that utterly inept wedge at the last, is a moot point: it's ended up in thick rough just off the fairway. Hansen, still pumped from his amazing chip at the last, wings his drive into trees on the left. Oh dear. Just as well Westwood kept his fairly straight.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>12 midnight:</strong> Hansen hits a delicious iron to six feet, but he's been forced to take a penalty drop. Weekley does likewise, but he's only hit two. Then Westwood gets inside them both with his second! This is getting silly now. And then it gets properly preposterous, Holmes hitting one to three feet. This is going to be a half in three, surely.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>12.03am:</strong> Weekley sweeps in his birdie effort, and then it's down to Westwood, who shows his stones by knocking in a five-footer which breaks slightly left to right. They can still salvage a half from this rubber, but they'll have to win at the 547-yard par-five last.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>12.10am:</strong> Weekley pushes his drive and ends up in water down the right! The pressure's on Holmes... and nobody seems to know where his ripper has ended up! Someone cries \"it's OK JB,\" but the camera catches some rippling water! Surely not. This is ridiculous if true. Westwood creams his drive pretty much straight down the centre of the fairway, as does Hansen. It could take a while to work out what's happened to Holmes's ball.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>12.20am:</strong> Yep, Holmes sent his drive into the water alright. Both Americans will have to drop. Weekley thins his third up the hole, but witlessly, into a deep bunker. Both Westwood and Hansen find the centre of the green. It's down to Holmes, taking his drop, to get down in two if he wants any chance to save this hole, but he comes up short. This looks like being halved, quite a result given the events on the 16th green.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>12.25am:</strong> Holmes has one desperate last clack to put the pressure on, but his putt from the front of the green is always staying out left. Hansen rolls his eagle putt to the edge of the cup and that's that. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 5.5-2.5 EUROPE.</strong> What a day for the USA, who have seemed simply more of a team than the Europeans. Europe has the quality to turn this round, but will need to start well tomorrow. Join us here from midday. Or 12.30pm maybe. Or 12.58pm, I'm making no promises now I come to think about it. Nighty night.</p>",
