  "<p>Ad campaigns and licensing deals are helping to keep the world's top 10 dead celebrities alive \u2014 and earning their estates more than $232m a year. And Elvis Presley's people know that better than most. With an annual income of $49m, his coffin's coffers are set to swell yet further with the release another remix of an Elvis track. But who decides where images of the dead appear? Meet the people who have the final say on where our stars can and can't be seen. </p> <h2>Andy Warhol</h2> <p><strong>Died: 1987, aged 58. Annual earnings: $15m</strong></p> <p>When iconic artist Andy's 15 minutes of fame came to an abrupt halt 21 years ago, he left his estate \u2014 including his vast body of art and personal possessions \u2014 to create the Andy Warhol Foundation For The Visual Arts. Now the foundation is solely responsible for what Warhol-related goods you can and can't buy. And licensing both his image and his work have proved lucrative.</p> <p>\"We're committed to making Warhol's work accessible to audiences and critics around the world,\" explains Michael Hermann, the foundation's director of licensing. \"Our licensing programme works with licensees who understand Warhol's cultural currency. Our criteria states they must be able to create products that reflect his maverick approach to art-making, and his sophisticated sense of design.\"</p> <p>The final decision lies with three full-time foundation staff members, with oversight from the foundations CFO, president, and licensing committee, comprising of board members. They've allowed Warhol's images to appear on clothes in the Pepe Jeans Andy Warhol Collection; the Andy Warhol Lexington Avenue fragrance from Bond No 9 NYC; Burton's Andy Warhol snowboards; Royal Elastics' Warhol flip-flops; and Andy Warhol jewellery from Robert Lee Morris.</p> <p>\"The foundation has been able to increase the quality and quantity of Warhol licensees worldwide, which has greatly boosted the revenue generated by the licensing programme,\" adds Hermann. \"That revenue has grown significantly over the past 10 years \u2014 from just over $400,000 in 1997 to over $2m in 2007. Revenues from licensing agreements have helped to enable the foundation to build an endowment which now exceeds $240m and from which it will make cash grants to cultural organisations that help artists, in excess of $13m this year. As Warhol himself said, 'Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art.'\" </p> <h2>Elvis Presley</h2> <p><strong>Died: 1977, aged 42. Annual earnings: $49m</strong></p> <p>Elvis may have left the building some 31 years ago but, since being dethroned in 2006 as the world's biggest beyond-the-grave money maker by young dead upstart Kurt Cobain, he's recently regained his crown as the King. And demand for money-making memorabilia shows no signs of dying out.</p> <p>\"We receive hundreds of requests to produce various products each year and only about one of every 200 is given the green light for production,\" explains Kevin Kern of Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc. \"Now we have more than 230 licensees worldwide with approximately 5,000 products available for purchase.\"</p> <p>Name any product and the chances are that you can buy it with Elvis's name, image or likeness attached. From Elvis black and gold plimsolls ($83) to an Elvis and Priscilla Barbie doll wedding set ($64.95) and Elvis \"sparkle silhouette\" iPod Nano case ($14.99) to a 68 Comeback Special Elvis wobbly head ($21.99).</p> <p>\"We take great pride in what products contain the name, image and likeness of Elvis,\" says Kevin. \"We design some merchandise in-house, the rest is brought to us by licensees. Each product is reviewed by a panel to make sure it is something the public wants, to be certain the demand is there from fans and collectors. We also require our licensees to go to great lengths to make certain the product resembles Elvis \u2014 such as figurines or where new art is created for a product.\" </p> <p>Given Elvis Presley's long association with Las Vegas it seems strange that it's taken until now for an Elvis-themed casino to hit the Strip. But he is finally getting his own $3.1bn Presley-inspired Vegas luxury hotel, casino, restaurants and showroom when it opens in 2012. So don't expect the King to drop down the big earners' list any time soon.</p> <p>\"When it comes to pop culture icons, Elvis is at the front of the line, even 30 years after his passing,\" adds Kevin. \"His sound, his music, his moves, his style: Elvis changed it all.\"</p> <h2>Albert Einstein</h2> <p><strong>Died: 1955, aged 76. Annual earnings: $20m</strong></p> <p>While few celebrity scientists spring to mind, there are even fewer who can turn over $20m a year, especially when they've been dead for 53 years. But Albert Einstein's bright idea of leaving his rights to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has certainly paid off. It turns over $20m annually, courtesy of the products it licenses and advertisements which make use of Einstein's image.<br>With 400 applications to use his image being made every year, it's the university that gives them the green light or the red card.</p> <p>\"Before we began managing his image, we dug around to find who he really was,\" explains Martin Cribbs, director and brand strategy manager of Greenlight, which manages Einstein's intellectual property rights on behalf of the university.</p> <p>\"We wanted to find out what his philosophies were and what the university did and didn't want to be associated with. And acquiring a licence is a rigorous process. Once applied for, we need to see three years of sales predictions; retail references to make sure they are serious about the product; and their commitment to green issues.\"</p> <p>Once vetted, the potential product is then presented to the university where it goes before a panel for a final decision. Some proposals, however, don't make it past the starting block.</p> <p>\"People have called us claiming to have a piece of Einstein's hair that they want to sell in little vials for his DNA,\" adds Martin. \"We said no. And while everything is considered, we won't be giving approval to scatalogical products like toilet paper, novelties, cigarettes or sex toys.</p> <p>\"We receive an application every single day of the year from places as far and wide as Africa, China and Namibia. But we only approve a total of around 40 applications a year. Our biggest success story is our Baby Einstein and Little Einstein license with Disney, which manufactures learning videos for children. We've sold hundreds of millions' worth of products. Every 12-year-old child with formal education knows Einstein's name and his face, so we try and do things to support and enhance his legacy.\"</p> <h2>Marilyn Monroe and James Dean</h2> <p><strong>Died: 1962, aged 36 and 1955, aged 24. Combined annual earnings: $13m</strong></p> <p>James Dean and Marilyn Monroe haven't let a little thing like premature death get in the way of their careers. As the poster boy and girl of bygone Hollywood, it's been marketing and management company CMG's job to keep their image in vogue by endorsing more than 10,000 James and Marilyn products worldwide.</p> <p>\"They may have died many years ago, but for most people, they still represent Hollywood, Mark Roesler, chairman and CEO of CMG explains. As long as Hollywood exists, they will still be in demand.\"</p> <p>Under the instruction of both celebrities' estates, Roesler oversees the protection, licensing and marketing of their intellectual property rights. These rights give an owner the power to control and market their works, images and names. \"They're the most valuable asset a celebrity has, and they continue to have value after their death,\" he explains. \"Without it [management], relatives of the deceased would get no money and run the risk of having other people use those rights for profit.\"</p> <p>For the home, you can purchase Monroe-endorsed chrome curtain hooks ($19.99) or a Marilyn light switch cover ($7.99); and for those who like to smoke in the bath, there's a James Dean ashtray ($5.83) and a celebriduck \u2014 a rubber duck with the actor's face on it ($9.95).</p> <p>\"We treat a personality as a brand,\" adds Mark. \"During their lifetimes these people were selective, so during their death we have to be selective too. Marilyn merlot has been a really successful wine for us, and a Sunsilk hairspray advertising campaign has also done well. And I'm very proud of a James Dean-inspired Hogan Rebel range of apparel. But a toilet seat with Marilyn or James's image on is something we'd typically say no to.</p> <p>\"As technology is rapidly changing, particularly in film and TV ads, we can breathe new life into these people.\" CMG represents more than 200 living, dead and historical figures and Mark says he has to put his clients' wishes ahead of any criticism he might receive for cheapening an icon's image. </p> <p>\"My clients own the rights so I don't care what someone thinks who doesn't own them,\" he says. \"We interact with fans all the time but we're not running a popularity contest. We are trying to protect and build these brands and we always do what we think is right for our client.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is raining. That's an under-statement: it's raining cats and dogs and I haven't got an umbrella. So I walk into the swanky giant offices of leading London law firm Slaughter and May drenched to the skin, looking every inch nothing like the \"sort\" they're used to. </p> <p>I am shown up to a meeting room with a decimal number and told to help <br>myself to some amazing looking cakes. Presently, Katie Wilcock, 25, enters the room looking every inch like someone who would never forget an umbrella. She pities me, I can tell, but is patient and offers me her time and expertise. She puts me at ease by telling me that many clients mistakenly walk into the huge deceptive water feature in the foyer instead of up the stairs and frequently enter meetings with wet feet, but I only feel marginally better. </p> <p>Essex-born Wilcock has worked for Slaughter and May since March 2007 when she joined on a two-year training contract. She graduated from Nottingham Law School in 2006 after completing a history degree at London's Royal Holloway University. Not knowing for sure whether she was ready for a career in law, she did what many prospective law students do and did a vacation scheme (a paid work experience stint) at London firm Covington &amp; Burling.</p> <p>She applied to Slaughter and May before starting in Nottingham. \"I really wanted to be at the cutting edge of deals, not the number-crunching end,\" she says, \"and Slaughter and May is in the magic circle and has a great reputation but it's also smaller and less unwieldy than others.\" </p> <p>The firm takes on around 90 trainees each year and, says Wilcock, it's <br>been more friendly than she ever imagined. \"Slaughter and May does <br>give the impression of being a bit stiff but all of that has been dispelled.\" </p> <p>Most weeks the graduates have some sort of training, whether it's a whole day, an evening session or lunchtime stint. \"Last week, for example,\" she says, \"I had a day course on client care. We are regulated on how we treat our clients in terms of confidentiality and conflicts of interests.\" </p> <p>At the end of her two years, Wilcock will be a qualified as a solicitor and <br>Slaughter and May associate. Having done placements in property, financing, corporate and, currently, litigation, she will decide which department she graduates into. \"I've enjoyed all of my seats so I should have a vague idea,\" she laughs, \"But I still can't decide.\" </p> <p>The possibilities for Slaughter and May trainees are heady. Wilcock has just come back from a six-month secondment to a company in New Zealand, part of a \"best-friend\" scheme with selected global firms. \" I might even stay there,\" she says, \"I loved it.\" </p> <p>The variety clearly appeals to Wilcock: \"You come in one day thinking you'll be doing one thing and suddenly it will go on the back-burner. You definitely have to be that sort of person.\" </p> <p>It's clear that Wilcock is well suited to the profession. She speaks in a <br>measured and careful way, repeating my words back to me to make sure she has understood (or to make me feel foolish, I can't decide). For obvious reasons she can't talk about her favourite cases but by way of example she will offer: \" In financing I helped with a transaction involving innovative fund raising by a large international charity. The transaction comprised a variety of cross-border work and more specific English law matters. The board was made up of a number of interesting individuals and we were constantly dealing with people around the world, which was fascinating.\" </p> <p>As I leave, having finally shed some of the morning's water, Wilcock says <br>gently, \"Why don't you pop into Boots and get yourself an umbrella?\"</p> <h2>Breaking the law</h2> <p>Competition for law training placements is stiff; applications should be <br>made at least two years in advance.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.slaughterandmay.com \">Slaughter and May</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.allenovery.com\">Allen &amp; Overy</a><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com \">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cliffordchance.com\">Clifford Chance </a></p>",

Nationwide is in a much stronger position than any organisation that is heavily dependent on the wholesale markets for funding. Customers' money is safe with Nationwide. Our size, strength and mutual status place us in a unique position to be able to provide a secure and trusted home for people's savings. We have managed our business prudently and will continue to do so. The society is not under any capital pressure and has a high quality balance sheet.\"</p> <p>As well as sponsoring England's football team, Nationwide is, by a huge margin, Britain's largest building society.</p> <p>It is also the second largest deposit taker in the UK, so its financial health is vital to all of us.</p> <p>This week it was the only mutual among the eight big lenders in the government bailout package.</p> <p>Should that give savers any cause for concern? After all, isn't it a rather similar business to Halifax, which has had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB?</p> <p>Nationwide board director Tony Prestedge told Guardian Money: \"We are a fundamentally different business. You could compare us to Halifax, but it is also a commercial bank, and it was HBOS where the issues existed. Our reliance on wholesale funding is between 29% and 31%, whereas HBOS was close to 50%. We were never exposed in that big a sense.\"</p> <p>So why is it in the government's \u00a350bn rescue package? Prestedge says: \"There are banks included, such as HSBC, which have said they won't be drawing on the money. At our current levels of capital, we do not see a need to draw against it either. But it makes every sense for Nationwide to be part of the discussion when systemic solutions are required.\"</p> <p>Chief executive Graham Beale adds that the society has a robust \"tier one capital ratio\" of 9.7% coupled with a high quality balance sheet.</p> <p>Did it take on too much risky lending during the boom years? Between 2007 and 2008, it more than doubled exposure from \u00a36.5bn to \u00a314.1bn in the buy-to-let and self-certification markets through subsidiaries UCB Home Loans and The Mortgage Works.</p> <p>\"We do have exposure to such markets, but the proportion of our lending in this area was never huge, and remains less than 15% of our total,\" says Prestedge.</p> <p>Nationwide led the way in demanding higher homebuyer deposits, even though that caused a near halving of its market share. But it has not all been plain sailing. It has been exposed to \"toxic assets\" - derivatives which can be impossible to value accurately.

We don't have shareholders - our customers own the business. We never give new customers better deals at the expense of existing customers.\"</p> <p>Some members will feel that at 34%, the Britannia's wholesale funding figure is on the high side. However, the society says this is a simplistic way of looking at things. The majority of Britannia's funds come from its 2.7 million savers, with further funds coming from customers of Britannia International, its offshore arm based on the Isle of Man - though for accounting purposes these are treated as wholesale, adds a spokesman.</p> <p>Some will also be concerned that Britannia has seen a sharp rise in the number of people seriously behind with their mortgage payments. The number of mortgages 12 months or more in arrears stood at 145 at the end of June this year, up from 84 at the end of December 2007. The society says this largely relates to its specialist lending arm, called Platform, and the loans it bought from GMAC-RFC.</p> <p>Platform specialises in prime, almost prime, minor and light adverse, buy-to-let and \"self-cert\" mortgages. The society says the arrears mainly relate to lending in 2006-07 by Platform, \"particularly higher loan-to-value advances for first-time buyers and loans against new-build city centre flats\".</p> <p>GMAC was a specialist in sourcing buy-to-let loans through the intermediary market, then selling them on. The society points out that it cherry-picked the loans it acquired from GMAC and that these books of business are making a profit. </p> <p>In August, chief executive Neville Richardson said the economic slowdown meant it believed the losses it had anticipated from some of its lending \"may come about more quickly than expected, but we're taking the necessary action to contain them\".</p> <p>As a result of some of these issues, Britannia members are likely to receive a smaller annual reward payment. There was speculation that for the first time in 13 years, there will be no \"membership reward\" profit-share payout. However, a spokesman says it is too early to talk about how much people might get. It also points out that, unlike some other lenders, it has never offered borrowers mortgages worth more than the house they are buying, and has no exposure to the US subprime mortgage market or \"collateralised debt obligations\".</p> <h2>Buckinghamshire</h2> <p><strong>Size </strong>49th with \u00a3139m in assets</p> <p><strong>Wholesale funding</strong> 15% </p> <p><strong>Average loan to value</strong> 33%</p> <p><strong>Arrears and repossessions</strong> Arrears of three to six months are 0.27% of total, six to 12 months is 0.27%.

  "<p>Some of the biggest names on the high street are now in the dark about their ownership, their cash in the bank and their future after the collapse of Kaupthing Bank in Iceland.</p> <p>The Reykjavik-based bank owns stakes in a variety of retail chains. It is banker to others and is a financial backer of Baugur, one of the most influential groups in the UK retail business. Baugur's portfolio includes more than 20 high street chains including Oasis, Principles, House of Fraser and the Iceland supermarket chain. </p> <p>Kaupthing is now under the control of the Icelandic government, while the UK government has seized its UK arm and put it into administration. </p> <p>Yesterday Baugur denied that parts of its empire, including Iceland and Hamleys, were being quietly offered for sale to private equity groups.</p> <p>There was also speculation that one fashion chain in the Baugur empire, which banks through Kaupthing, might run out of cash and be unable to pay its staff. It is understood the bank swept money out of business accounts each night and pushed it back in the next morning. Cash swept into the bank overnight earlier this week was frozen when the bank collapsed.</p> <p>Kaupthing also owns direct stakes in cash'n'carry chain Booker, supermarket group Somerfield, which is being sold to the Co-op, and fashion businesses Phase Eight, Mosaic and Jane Norman. Mosaic, which has 2,100 outlets and 13,000 staff, operates Oasis, Karen Millen and Coast and shoe stores Nine West and Pied a Terre. It is 20% owned by Kaupthing and 49% by Baugur.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Kaupthing said it was unclear whether the stakes are held in the UK arm of the bank or in Iceland. \"The board has resigned,\" she said. \"There is no one to ask because they have all gone.\" If they are in the UK, the administrators, Ernst &amp;Young, are likely to put them up for sale. A spokeswoman said it would take some time to unravel.</p> <p>Baugur, meanwhile, is trying to distance itself from Kaupthing. An executive close to Baugur insisted it would not be affected: \"What the UK government has done will have no effect on Baugur.\" </p> <p>The Iceland connection is worrying insurers that protect suppliers when retailers go bankrupt. On Thursday Coface withdrew cover from several of the Baugur chains. </p> <p>A Baugur spokesman was unable to say where Kaupthing's stakes were held or whether they would now be sold. \"There is not a huge amount of clarity on any of this. I wish it was clearer.\"</p> <p>Baugur also owns stakes of up to 20% in four quoted retailers: Debenhams, French Connection, Moss Bros and Woolworths. Its stake building through derivatives was arranged by Kaupthing and Landsbanki, another collapsed Icelandic bank, and it is unclear where those positions are held.</p> <p>Other UK retailers with Icelandic connections are also facing problems. Sports chain JJB has a \u00a320m bridging loan with Kaupthing; yesterday upmarket fashion group Hardy Amies collapsed into administration after its Icelandic backer Arev turned down a request for emergency cash help. Fashion label Ghost, also backed by Arev, is also seeking cash to survive.</p> <h2>Who owns what?</h2> <p><strong>Baugur</strong></p> <p><strong>Clothing</strong> Mosaic (49%): Karen Millen, Coast, Oasis, Nine West, Pied a Terre; Whistles; Principles; All Saints; Matthew Williamson; Jane Norman; Warehouse</p> <p><strong>Food</strong> Whittard of Chelsea; Iceland</p> <p><strong>Other</strong> House of Fraser; Goldsmiths; Mappin &amp; Webb; Watches of Switzerland; Wyevale Garden Centres</p> <p><strong>Stakes in quoted companies</strong> Debenhams 13%; French Connection 20%; Moss Bros 29%; Woolworths 10%</p> <p><strong>Kaupthing</strong></p> <p>Phase Eight; Mosaic (20%), Somerfield (\u00a31.8bn sale agreed with the Co-op, but not yet approved by OFT)</p>",
  "<p>It was one of dozens of advertisements in the Chinese Business Gazette, a freesheet circulated in Chinatown in London. A brothel was advertising for staff: \"Located in outer London. Catered only for westerners. Busy. Comfort-able living environment. Safety guaranteed. Recruiting Misses. Housekeeper urgently required. Female only.\" Hsiao-Hung Pai, a reporter who has carried out undercover investigations for the Guardian in the past, applied for the housekeeper job.</p> <p>Summoned to a neat, featureless block of flats in leafy Bedfordshire, she was hired on the spot by Linda, an illegal immigrant using an assumed English name, who turns an annual profit of \u00a3250,000 running two brothels employing teenage girls trafficked from China. Hsiao-Hung's duties were to cook, clean and look after the girls.</p> <p>She soon realised the \"misses\" came and went on a weekly basis, rotated through Chinese-run brothels in a routine intended to keep the customers happy and the authorities guessing. It's part of a well-established system. Young girls are lured to the UK with the promise of lucrative, respectable careers. Some as young as 11, they arrive without passports or visas, some claiming asylum at British airports, having paid traffickers thousands of pounds for their transit. Once here, they vanish from the hostels or foster care to which they have been assigned by the immigration authorities, often ending up in brothels run from suburban flats and houses.</p> <p>Hsiao-Hung - posing as Xiao Yun, just in from Zhejiang province, in south-eastern China - saw for herself that the misses are never allowed out and have no idea where they are, the time of day or even the month. Few can speak English or know anything about their rights, the UK's asylum processes or its legal system; they are made to believe they have no alternative but to remain in the brothels until they have earned enough to buy their release, and their only contact with British society is the men with whom they have sex.</p> <p>Madam Linda's phone rings. \"It's Big Cunt,\" she says - she has such a nickname for all her clients. She arrived from Beijing four years back and worked as a prostitute until she'd amassed enough money to climb up the pecking order and become a lao ban niang, a madam. She switches into a sweet English voice: \"We've got a nice young girl, cup 32, very pretty, lots of demand.\" She is talking about Miss Rong, an exhausted-looking Chinese girl dressed in a lacy pink negligee, sitting on the sofa behind her, who was trafficked to Britain 18 months ago and who won't divulge her age.</p> <p>Trade is brisk today. Yet none of the other residents of Avon Court, a 70s block of flats on Shakespeare Road, Bedford, seems to suspect what's going on in this two-bedroom, ground-floor flat. Dozens of Chinese girls pass through here, part of a network that has sprawled out across almost every British town and city. It is a criminal enterprise that blurs the boundaries between trafficking and smuggling, ensnaring girls and women who in many cases leave China of their own free will. Often sent with the best wishes of their community, which has clubbed together to pay the exorbitant fees, the victims cannot bear to tell their families what they have been compelled to do on arrival. None would consider turning witness against their controllers: their heads are filled with horror stories of how they will be raped and imprisoned by the British police, and what would happen to those back home. Girls who attempt to run away are often hunted down, abducted from local authority care or hospitals. Frequently, victims emerge only when, injured, sick or pregnant, they have been abandoned on a street corner.</p> <p>It is evident there are incredible profits to be made. Last year, police discovered \u00a393m transferred back to China via one bank account held by a Chinese restaurant in Kent - money suspected to have been earned through trafficking and brothel-keeping. Recently, two specialist national police units have been created to define, penetrate and disrupt the trade. Home Office minister Vernon Coaker, who is leading the government's new anti-trafficking initiative, told us, \"Just five years back I would not have believed this kind of thing could be happening in Britain. But it is down your street, in your lane, run by communities into which we have made few meaningful inroads.\"</p> <p>\"Hurry up, cow cunt,\" Madam Linda shrieks at her new housekeeper. The doorbell rings and an overweight, married white man in his 50s saunters in. Two minutes later, \"Little Dick\" arrives. Then a third: an Asian mini-cab driver so new he has no pet name. They sit, sullenly, each waiting their turn with Miss Rong. When they have left, and Madam Linda has gone to check on her misses in another rented flat, on Station Road, Miss Rong tells us her story.</p> <p>She was once a waitress in a Chinese town she doesn't wish to name. She was earning less than \u00a350 a month and living with her parents when local traffickers persuaded her she would make her fortune in London. On her arrival, Miss Rong was taken to a brothel in Ealing where she had sex with seven clients on the first day. \"You clench your teeth and endure the pain,\" she says. After a few weeks, \"Alan\", the brothel's Hong Kong boss, passed her on to a pimp with an apartment overlooking Baker Street in London, trading as China Red. When Miss Rong was found to have syphilis, she was thrown out. Without papers, she could not go to a GP for medication. There was no going back home until the debt was paid and no words to describe to her conservative parents the reality of life abroad.</p> <p>Sick and penniless, Miss Rong sought out another brothel, this time on a council estate in Seven Sisters, north London, known as the Red Tower. Last summer, she was working in a Birmingham-based business advertising \"student-like young girls\" and \"female servants\". By the time she was taken on by Madam Linda at Avon Court - on duty from 7am to 2am, seven days a week, dosed with antibiotics bought by Madam Linda to counter the syphilis - she estimates she'd had sex with more than 7,000 men. \"I must earn as fast as I can,\" Miss Rong says, adding that she's paid \u00a320 for each 20-minute session. \"I must get through it all and get back home.\"</p> <p>After Hsiao-Hung Pai had been at the brothel for three days, Madam Linda told her to start giving customers massages. Soon after, Hsiao-Hung left.</p> <p>Five foot nothing and wearing a white T-shirt, Lingshan Lin, 15, and her 11-year-old sister Lingran disappeared on September 28 2006 from a social services hostel in Hove, East Sussex, where they were staying pending their asylum hearing. On August 24 2007, Li Juan He, 16, ran away from a hostel in Worthing, West Sussex. Xi Wang, 16, disappeared from the same hostel two months later, on October 7 2007. Jing Jing Lu, 16, vanished from a hostel in Sevenoaks, Kent, on December 15 2007.</p> <p>All had entered the UK just days before their disappearance; the only evidence they had ever been here is the photographs taken of them by police, immigration officials or social services. The authorities fear they may have been dragged into the brothel network which, our findings suggest, has more than 4,000 Chinese teenagers and young adults in its grip. Police and social services know from missing person reports that more than 1,000 have disappeared, almost all of whom have been trafficked through or were born in the Chinese province of Fujian.</p> <p>Which is puzzling, as Fujian is one of the wealthiest provinces in the People's Republic, highly industrialised and pumping out goods for the west. There are opportunities galore. And when you meet Fujianese people on their home turf, they talk only of success. We are invited to a dinner in an upscale restaurant in Fuzhou, the booming provincial capital, and our fellow guests are brimming with confidence. We ask Ai Hwa Lin - a friend of a friend, who owns two dress shops and a new \u00a3150,000 condominium overlooking the Min river - why people, especially teenagers, risk all to leave here. \"No one leaves any more,\" she says. \"We have everything we need.\"</p> <p>But when her husband, Gao Xin, pipes up for the first time, an hour into the banquet, he speaks in English, with a New Jersey drawl: \"Welcome to China, where life's real good.\" As Ai Hwa glowers, an indiscreet relative chimes in: \"Gao Xin has been away for 17 years.\" He was working illegally as a chef in a Fujianese restaurant in New York state and returned three weeks ago - the first time he'd been home.</p> <p>Ai Hwa reluctantly admits that we are last-minute additions to her husband's homecoming dinner and that he is the source of their wealth. We now notice how wan and fragile he seems, as if he almost worked himself to death. He is a stranger among family and friends. But after many toasts of Sedrin beer, it emerges that everyone around the table has recently paid for someone to travel abroad illegally, raising sums as large as \u00a320,000 for their illicit passage. Expectations are high, but there is no clear idea of what the relatives will do on arrival. Despite the weekly phone calls, the emails and photographs of which everyone here talks, no one really knows what is being endured by their loved ones abroad.</p> <p>A man in a golf shirt ambles over and introduces himself as Officer Zheng Xian, head of the city police's economic crimes division, whose responsibilities include countering trafficking. He is one of Ai Hwa's oldest friends and asks if we have heard her sister's story. He says her parents paid criminals to smuggle her to Britain in 1997; she had an excruciating six-month journey via Russia, the Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Holland, and ended up earning slave wages in British garment and poultry factories.</p> <p>Everyone has been touched by smuggling, but no one has mentioned the missing. We bring out a sheaf of reports from the UK, including ones about Fujianese girls as young as 11 who might have been swallowed up by the sex trade. \"They're just working,\" one woman mutters as she rises and leaves. </p> <p>\"You'll never find their families,\" says Xian, pointing out that Fujian has a population of almost 40 million: the names we have are so common, it would be like looking for a Jane Smith in London. In less than five minutes, everyone has gone except Ai Hwa and her ailing husband, who snaps out of his dream world. \"'What was it all for?\" he asks of no one in particular. \"I lost my life. Nobody should go.\"</p> <p>Fujian province has had a criminal tradition since the 70s, when gangs smuggling luxury goods from Taiwan began transporting people, too. They first smuggled them to the UK in the 90s, mostly to work in restaurant kitchens for the long-established Hong Kong Chinese community. It was only when 58 Fujianese men and women were found broiled in the back of a lorry transporting tomatoes through Dover in June 2000 that the province became known in Britain as a haven for snakehead gangs who could evade whatever obstacles our immigration services threw up. Four years later, 23 paperless Fujianese workers who earned pennies picking cockles in Morecambe Bay were drowned. And alongside the illegal workers and gangmasters who made the headlines, a hidden parallel trade was emerging - in girls recruited into the nascent Chinese brothel network creeping across the UK.</p> <p>But no one in Fuzhou will talk details: names, methods, routes. Some clearly fear reprisals, while to others it is commercially sensitive information.</p> <p>We drive out to villages from which the missing girls told immigration officials they came. All are dominated by new churches as large as ocean liners. We call in on one, the True Jesus Church, and ask the pastor, Chen Jin Yun, if she will help us find families whose children have gone missing in Britain. She laughs. \"Many have got children working in the UK. They love it there, but keeping in contact is always a struggle.\"</p> <p>She introduces us to duck farmer Mr Liang. All three of his brothers have gone to the UK, he says. We ask about methods, money, how they're doing. Liang sidesteps most of the questions: \"Oh, one of them is a millionaire. Everyone who goes from here to there, young or old, does very well.\"</p> <p>Liang's neighbours crowd into the room and confirm they all have children in the UK, some as young as 13. We decide against bringing out the reports of the missing. Don't they discourage their children from going so far away from home now that there are plenty of opportunities in Fujian, we ask, mentioning the hundreds of garment factories lining every highway. Liang jumps in: \"Those are menial jobs for outsiders,\" he says - Fujianese people have higher expectations than the wages offered by these factories, \u00a325 for an 84-hour week. Heads around him nod. We later check with the factory bosses and they confirm that tens of thousands of their employees are young women from impoverished and predominantly agricultural provinces such as Anhui, Hubei and Henan, 1,000 miles from here, whose residents cannot afford to be so picky.</p> <p>Later, Liang shows us the vast concrete skeleton of a building rising beside his duck pond: \"My new home. Paid for by my brothers.\"</p> <p>Villages such as Xi Zai in Fujian province have emptied to the UK, leaving behind a dwindling population of the very young and very old. The Chinese government has recently said it will crack down on trafficking, establishing special police units to do so. Liang's cousin, it turns out, is a detective in the Jinfeng police force. We get out the reports to show her. She doesn't want to know, though three of her siblings are in the UK. \"You should speak to the Chinese embassy in London,\" she snaps.</p> <p>We leave, but our Chinese researcher returns a few days later. Liang, the duck farmer, is delighted to see her. He feels more relaxed among Chinese people, he says, asking what she does. \"I'm a student, from a poor family,\" she says. \"Why don't you marry someone rich?\" he suggests. \"Or go to London?\" He offers to assist: \"If your family can raise \u00a315,000, my cousin will get you over.\" Our researcher adds a level of difficulty. \"I have a young cousin, too, 12, who would like to come along.\" Liang shrugs. \"Great. Don't worry. We send plenty of kids. It's 100% safe.\"</p> <p>Eventually, he explains how it works. His cousin is just one of a hundred people offering similar services. All can procure forged passports redesignating the travellers as Japanese or South Korean citizens, nationalities that raise fewer suspicions with immigration officials in Britain. Our researcher would be first flown or driven to Russia, where Chinese people require no visa. Then they might fly on directly to the UK, probably avoiding Heathrow. \"Few bother with trucks and boats any more,\" Liang says. Another preferred option is flying to a European city, then on to the UK with easyJet, the Madrid-London route being a current favourite.</p> <p>Our researcher will be given a UK sim card to hide in her luggage, and a phone number to write on her bra strap. She is to activate her phone and make the call on landing, and meet a Fujianese contact. \"Hang around the airport before going through immigration,\" Liang says, \"so they have no idea which flight you came in on, otherwise they could send you back. Then go to immigration and say you're a teenage asylum seeker. They have to let you in, and Britain will allow you to stay until you are 18.\"</p> <p>\"When can I go?\" our researcher asks. </p> <p>\"The next trip will be in November. We need sufficient passengers to make it worth our while. Eight or nine on a flight.\"</p> <p>Few of the British authorities tackling trafficking have been given the freedom to travel across China, observing for themselves the suffering and upheaval that result from the human trade. Relationships between British detectives and China's ministry of public security are in their infancy, with the first conference between Fujianese officials and their opposite numbers in the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) taking place in the UK this autumn. The traffickers have had a 15-year head start - the British authorities having spent nearly that long arguing over data and definitions. The first warning that Chinese children were being abused came in 1995 when dozens began arriving, unaccompanied, at Gatwick airport, claiming asylum, but the signs were ignored by everyone except the social workers called to deal with them.</p> <p>What those sending the children to Britain appeared to have hit upon, as the duck farmer Liang explained, was the specifics of British law, and in particular the breadth of the 1989 Children Act, whereby foreign teenagers travelling alone who claimed asylum had to be allowed into the country and cared for by a local authority as a \"child in need\" until they were 18.</p> <p>Sussex social workers had so many demands on them, they fought to find funding for a young asylum seekers team. The team's trafficking caseworker was Lynne Chitty, whose house in Portsmouth is filled with a jumble of files, photographs and incident reports relating to missing Chinese girls. She tells us, \"We would get the call, go up to the airport and find these kids in a holding room. They all had little bits of rolled-up paper with UK numbers on them and were desperate to make a call. Within hours of us taking them into care, they had vanished.\"</p> <p>From the brief interviews Chitty managed to conduct, she became convinced that all had been trafficked and many were ending up in brothels or worse. \"No one wanted to hear or was overly concerned about the kids going missing. The only calls I got were from the Met police in London saying they had fished the body of an Asian child out of the river and asking if it was one of mine. And I had to say: 'I have no idea.'\" </p> <p>It did not take long for the traffickers to evolve new methods. Instead of arriving with a telephone number, the children began presenting addresses and names of relatives in the UK, hoping to bypass the local authority's hostels. In 2000, Chitty took a call from one immigration official who, reviewing case files, discovered that his Gatwick team had released more than 100 Chinese children to the same \"uncle\". Unable to interest the police, Chitty eventually traced the man to a north London Chinese takeaway. The intelligence she gleaned went nowhere. Immigration officials conducted no inquiry. The phone numbers were never followed up and Chitty continued to see children vanishing.</p> <p>By 2003, people trafficking was such a global problem that the UN produced a protocol, defining it as a trade that subjugated more than 2.4 million people a year. It called for a unified response, but in western Europe only Denmark, France and Spain signed up at the time. It was not until early 2006 that the British government signed, and established Soca, which made targeting traffickers one of its priorities.</p> <p>Often it is only those spat out by the network who can testify to its existence and many of them find that life on the outside can be just as harsh. Jodie Bourke is a former children's adviser with the Refugee Council who has assisted 30 teenagers suspected of being trafficked to the UK. She told us: \"One heavily pregnant 17-year-old Chinese girl was brought to our attention when she walked into a London hospital. They didn't want to deal with her. Who was going to pay? It was only after prolonged discussions that the local authority agreed to look after her and we got to sit down and hear how she had been abducted 18 months earlier from her village in south-western China and driven to Russia, where she'd been locked in a hotel room for months and repeatedly raped. Then she was trafficked to the UK and so it went on.\"</p> <p>Victims rarely receive any compassion, says Lucy Kralj of the Helen Bamber Foundation, a London-based human rights organisation which works with trafficked women and children. \"Most of those we get to see entered the country as children and emerge from the brothels as adults, only to be consigned to Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, in Bedfordshire, pending deportation. They are delivered to us for counselling by Group 4 Securicor in caged vans, often surrounded by their own vomit. Recently, two Chinese girls, who had escaped prostitution, were so weak they had to be carried up our stairs by security guards, who then stood behind them throughout the counselling sessions, sealing the exits.\"</p> <p>Having seen Chinese women who were so young when they were taken into prostitution that they don't even know the basics of biology, who feel as if \"a viper is eating away inside them\", Kralj says her job has become \"believing the unimaginable\". But in the UK, it appears, many in government, social services, immigration and the police are acting as if they have trouble believing at all.</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting: Hsiao-Hung Pai</p>",
  "<p>The character that Sarah Silverman plays on stage and television - also called Sarah Silverman - is girlish, sincere and eager to please, but also narcissistic, bigoted and, in Silverman's words, \"kind of an asshole\". There's no topic on which she doesn't believe she has something to contribute: race, the Holocaust, rape, gay rights and global poverty all fall victim to her mistaken belief that she is an exemplary concerned citizen. Take the Aids crisis: \"If we can put a man on the moon,\" Silverman deadpans, as if embarking on a well-worn platitude, \"we can put a man with Aids on the moon. And someday, we can put everyone with Aids on the moon.\" She speaks earnestly, inviting you to empathise with the difficulties of being a good liberal in this day and age: \"I want to get an abortion, but my boyfriend and I are having trouble conceiving.\" </p> <p>It is several years now since the US release of Jesus Is Magic, the concert film that made Silverman's name, but its jokes have lost none of their power to startle, forcing an audience to compute what she just said, whether she's allowed to say it - and whether they're allowed to laugh. \"Everybody blames the Jews for killing Christ, and then the Jews try to pass it off on the Romans,\" she says, shrugging her broad shoulders to imply that everyone's entitled to their opinion. Then, suddenly serious: \"I'm one of the few people that believes it was the blacks.\"</p> <p>The real Sarah Silverman, who is 37, lives in a big, bright apartment off Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles with her dog, a chihuahua-pug mix named Duck - \"A stoned decision I'm stuck with.\" She recently split from her boyfriend of five years, the TV host Jimmy Kimmel (although not, so far as we know, for the reasons you might infer from the song she performed on his show a few months back, I'm Fucking Matt Damon, which went on to win an Emmy). Journalists, especially male ones, often feel obliged to describe her beauty as \"unconventional\", which as Silverman notes is usually just self-flattery on the journalist's part: \"They think they're the only ones. It's like, 'You know what? I think she's attractive!' Like I'm a freaky choice or something.\" Her rising stardom has graced her with a personal assistant, a 23-year-old named James, whom she enjoys pretending to treat as a butler, snapping her fingers imperiously, though she still seems to be acclimatising to the kind of lifestyle that involves a personal assistant. \"Last week, I was trying so hard to find things for him to do,\" she says when he steps outside, \"I had to send him out to buy batteries and tennis balls.\"</p> <p>Some interesting cross-cultural chemistry seems guaranteed later this month, when Silverman arrives in Britain for her first solo performances here: a country that prides itself on its appreciation of irony, playing host to the comedian who tests its outer limits more than any currently working. Silverman doesn't plan on changing her act, which frequently mixes politically edgy stand-up with songs full of toilet humour. \"I'm sheltered, so I don't know what to expect,\" she says, \"but it's weird when British comics come over here and their whole act is about 'I'm different from you, I'm from another country!' I'm just, like, whatever. Just tell jokes. I find you not as adorable as you think you are.\"</p> <p>When we meet, Silverman is absorbed in a different project: a short video (now available online) that aims to garner votes for Barack Obama in Florida by persuading her young, Jewish, Democrat-supporting fans to lobby their elderly Floridian Jewish relatives, an especially difficult demographic for Obama. The video rehashes a vintage Silverman skit in which she explains why, far from being at odds with each other, young black American men and elderly Jews should embrace their commonalities. \"They may seem totally different, but on paper they're the same,\" she says, sitting on a sofa in her apartment between a Young Black Man and an Elderly Jewish Woman. \"I mean, think about it. Tracksuits - let's start there... Car of choice, the Cadillac. They're both crazy about their grandkids... They both say 'yo' all the time, though Jews go right to left, 'oy'. What else? Oh: all of their friends are dying.\" It's a typically brain-twisting Silverman exercise, playing with the spectres of racism and antisemitism, in a video funded by the Jewish Council for Education and Research in support of an African-American candidate.</p> <p>Silverman's humour has been well characterised, in the online magazine Slate, as \"meta-bigotry\" - the same approach adopted by the creators of South Park and by Sacha Baron Cohen on a good day. As a stand-up and in her TV show, the Sarah Silverman Program, she parodies the ways that we - bigots and self-styled liberal non-bigots alike - discuss taboo topics, or avoid discussing them, or tie ourselves in logical knots in order to hold what we think are the correct opinions about them. This is edgy in the truest sense of the term, but Silverman's blank-faced persona, of course, doesn't think she's being edgy except at those moments when she really isn't. \"Nazis are a-holes, and I'll be the first to admit it, because I'm edgy,\" she says in Jesus Is Magic. \"But they're cute when they're little - I will give them that.\"</p> <p>The biggest risk involved in being a meta-bigot is that people will think you're secretly a real bigot, wrapping your hatred in a protective blanket of irony. Some people do think this about Silverman. But the criticism that seems to have stung the most came from the New York Times writer AO Scott, who called her act \"the latest evidence that mocking political correctness has become a form of political correctness in its own right. She depends on the assumption that only someone secure in his or her own lack of racism would dare to make, or to laugh at, a racist joke, the telling of which thus becomes a way of making fun simultaneously of racism and of racial hypersensitivity... Naughty as she may seem, she's playing safe.\" (\"That was something that always festered in the back of my mind that I never talked about,\" Silverman has said.)</p> <p>But a good Silverman routine should still make her typical audience - white, liberal - feel uncomfortable, not least because of the way her glib homilies seem to echo those to which we're prone, even though their content is the precise opposite. A typical one-liner begins as if it's a pro-diversity clich\u00e9, then swerves sharply in another direction: \"I learned that whether you're gay, bisexual - it doesn't matter,\" she says brightly, cocking her head. \"Because at the end of the day... they're both gross.\"</p> <p>Silverman was born and raised in New Hampshire, the youngest of four sisters, in a family that by virtue of being Jewish and liberal was almost unique. \"It was a very conservative area,\" she recalls. \"Very white-blonde, very preppy, hoity-toity. Ever since I was little, people would ask, 'Are you from New York?' and I'd say, 'I'm from here!' I felt like a stranger in a strange land.\" She was \"hairy and dark\", and used humour at school to deflect insults about her \"monkey legs\". But she attributes her earliest performative leanings to her father, Donald, who owned a clothes shop called Crazy Sophie's Factory Outlet, for which he recorded his own local radio ads. (\"Spend your time at the mall - spend your money at Crazy Sophie's!\") When she was three, he taught her to say \"bitchbastarddamnshit\". \"He thought it was hilarious,\" she says. \"I would say them for his friends, and all these adults would go crazy laughing. And they were laughing at pure shock value - a tiny child saying filthy words. It became very addictive for me. I chased that excellent feeling, even from that age.\"</p> <p>Before she was born, her parents had had a son, who died in an accident while in the care of her grandmother; they told Sarah about him when she turned five. \"Every Sunday my grandmother would pick us up in the car and we'd go to a diner for lunch,\" Silverman remembers. \"The Sunday just after I'd learned about Jeffrey, we got in the car, and she goes, 'Everybody put your seatbelt on!' And I go, 'Yeah... because we don't want to wind up like Jeffrey!'</p> <p>\"I thought that would kill,\" she recalls, shaking her head. \"I remember bursting with excitement to say it. And she just started sobbing. God, my poor Nana. But up until then I had learned that saying the worst possible thing was funny, you know?\"</p> <p>Her parents divorced when she was six. \"It was the happiest day of my life. I remember my sisters crying and saying, 'She doesn't understand.' I was sad, too, but I was sad because I'd learned a dance, and nobody was watching. I remember thinking, 'I don't understand? They're moving away from each other! I couldn't be happier.' Every single night was screaming. I look back on it even now, and I totally got it. I was happy.\" By her early teens, though, she had become deeply depressed, and a chronic bedwetter. (She was dispatched to see a local psychiatrist. At their first appointment, he prescribed Xanax; when she arrived for her second appointment, it turned out that he'd hanged himself.) The cloud lifted only after she arrived in New York, aged 18. \"I remember describing my depression to my stepdad, and saying, 'I feel like I'm homesick, but I'm home.' And then I arrived in New York, and I swear, the day I moved there, it felt like I was home. I felt like I was a bear who'd been raised in the, in the...\" She trails off. \"I don't know. I don't know where bears aren't raised. But you see what I mean.\"</p> <p>Silverman didn't last long at New York University: she was spending every evening handing out flyers for comedy clubs in exchange for time on stage, and would often fall asleep during lectures; she soon quit to pursue comedy full-time. In footage of her early shows, she can be seen mocking the clich\u00e9s of live stand-up - \"I like having sex! Are there any sex people here tonight?\" - and exploring the humorous potential of her Jewishness: \"My sister's getting married, and they're taking each other's names, so she'll be Susan Silverman-Abramowitz. But they're thinking of shortening it to just 'Jews'.\" </p> <p>By 22, she'd been hired as a writer on Saturday Night Live, any trainee American comedian's dream job. She was fired almost immediately. SNL at the time wasn't welcoming to women, nor to comedians with a distinctive voice who couldn't write for a variety of characters. Besides, one imagines NBC executives blanching at some of Silverman's jokes, such as this line, about a law requiring women seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours to consider their decision: \"I think it's a good law. I was going to get an abortion the other day. I totally wanted an abortion, and it turns out I was just thirsty.\"</p> <p>Then, in 2001, after various small roles in film and TV, she made an appearance on Conan O'Brien's late-night talkshow that has since become notorious. During the interview, Silverman recounted being summoned for jury service and wanting to find a way to get out of it. \"So my friend said, why don't you write something really racist on the form, like, 'I hate chinks'? Yeah, but you know, I don't want people to think I'm racist - I just want to get out of jury duty. So I filled out the form and I wrote\" - at this point she beamed, smugly - \" 'I love chinks.'\" As O'Brien buried his head in his hands, Silverman added: \"And who doesn't?\"</p> <p>This joke is, of course, not racist, but about racism: the humour is in Silverman's apparent belief that changing the word \"hate\" to \"love\" acquits her of bigotry. Still, one could argue that \"chinks\" is an easier word for Silverman to use than for people of Chinese heritage to have to hear, and it provoked a furious attack from Guy Aoki, the president of a lobby group called Media Action Network for Asian-Americans. The resultant furore culminated in a disastrous joint appearance by Silverman and Aoki on the talkshow Politically Incorrect, in which Silverman tried to defend the joke before losing her cool and calling Aoki a \"douchebag\".</p> <p>She says the experience taught her never to try to defend her humour. \"It's so subjective, comedy,\" she says now. \"If you don't find something funny, it can easily be truly offensive, so I usually just say I'm really sorry.\" (Notably, she declined to apologise for another infamous appearance, in the 2005 documentary film The Aristocrats, in which her comic turn ends by straightfacedly accusing a real, much-loved American TV personality of rape.) In her stand-up act, she says that the \"chinks\" affair taught her another lesson: she learned that racism is bad. \"And I mean bad, like in that black way.\"</p> <p>Silverman's humour, which works so well when her topic is the way in which we discuss relations between social groups, only really fails when her targets are individuals: then, it can seem cruel. \"Wow, she's amazing,\" Silverman said of Britney Spears at the 2007 MTV Music Video Awards at which the troubled singer tried to stage a comeback. \"I mean, she's 25 years old and she's already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life. It's mind-blowing.\" At another MTV event, days before Paris Hilton was due to go to jail, Silverman drew loud cackles from the audience with a lewd joke at her expense. Hilton, who was in the audience, looked frozen and mortified; unexpectedly, you found yourself feeling sorry for her.</p> <p>Silverman seems uninterested in exploring what it means to be a woman in an overwhelmingly male-dominated business. Early last year, when the journalist Christopher Hitchens wrote an article in Vanity Fair entitled Why Women Aren't Funny, Silverman was endlessly pestered to write a rebuttal. In fact, the Hitchens article didn't live up to its title - it merely speculated about why men more often use humour to attract women than vice versa - and Silverman didn't disagree with it. \"Snore,\" she says today, when the topic arises. \"That article was just saying that in general, men who are not necessarily attractive, as a survival skill, use humour to get girls. And for women it is not that way. There are other things you do to get men that are very superficial, very materialistic - and that says more about men than it does about women. The reason there are lots of funny women is because of other survival skills they've had to develop, whether because they're fat or they're hairy or they've had a rough life, and they have to create this shell of a sense of humour in order to survive through it.\"</p> <p>Make no mistake: Sarah Silverman does not want any of your labels. \"People are always introducing me as 'Sarah Silverman, Jewish comedian,'\" she says at one point during her stage act. \"I hate that! I wish people would see me for who I really am. I'm white!\"</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Silverman appears at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on October 19. Series 1 of The Sarah Silverman Program will be screened on Paramount Comedy 1 from October 20-24. Jesus Is Magic is out on DVD on October 13.</p>",

  "<p>Osbert Lancaster died in July 1986, a week short of his 78th birthday. Hearing news of his death, the novelist Anthony Powell sat down to compose one of those sober estimates of a lately departed friend that abound in his diaries. Lancaster, Powell decided, \"had so formalised his appearance, public - indeed private - manner of speech, that it is difficult to know what lay beneath the stylised fa\u00e7ade\". Always a realist, even in an obituary notice, he wondered whether \"Perhaps there was not a great deal more than what was revealed.\" Powell offered further remarks on the subject's \"strong feelings about the arts and architecture\", and evidence of good \"if not impeccable\" taste, before rather wintrily diagnosing \"some lack of inner life, everything important seeming on the surface\".</p> <p>Looking at the photographs included in <em>Cartoons and Coronets</em> (Frances Lincoln), a selection of Lancaster's work by James Knox, published in conjunction with the Wallace Collection's centenary exhibition, I see instantly what Powell meant about stylisation. The most revealing portrait (revealing, that is, in what it doesn't reveal) comes from the mid-1950s. Lancaster, then in his 40s, hair slicked back above a bristling cavalryman's moustache, is wearing a check suit of immaculate cut; a white handkerchief burgeons from the breast pocket. His hat dangles from thumb and forefinger: the hand itself rests on a walking stick. Dandyish, inscrutable, face slightly at an angle, he also looks unexpectedly tough: the kind of figure whose natural milieu may well be a Mayfair drawing room, a gallery opening or a first night, but who is still determined to stop at absolutely nothing.</p> <p>In Lancaster's defence, stylisation was endemic to the kind of world in which he operated. The son of a well-to-do City man who died in the first world war, educated at Charterhouse and Lincoln College, Oxford, he was a cadet member of the group of high-achieving writers and artists (and, it should be said, low-achieving non-writers and non-artists) whom critics have tended to classify under the group heading of the \"Brideshead generation\". His second volume of autobiography, <em>With an Eye to the Future</em> (1967) is full of fascinated glances at the London party world of the early 30s, including a set-piece description of Augustus John being borne away, dead drunk, from Unity Mitford's coming-out ball by a couple of footmen. John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh and Cyril Connolly were lifelong friends, whose foibles occasionally re-emerged to animate Lancaster's easel. In 1950, hearing that Waugh had proposed to Connolly that they should spend Holy Week in Rome, Lancaster sent Powell a \"rough sketch for a gigantic mural to be placed in the coffee-room at Whites by public subscription\". The drawing, which shows a monk-like penitent abasing himself at the feet of Pope Pius XII, as Waugh gravely officiates and cherubs dance overhead, is titled <em>Connolly at Canossa</em></p> <p>Lancaster's early interest in drawing had been encouraged by a sympathetic art master, \"Purple\" Johnson. After Oxford and a spell at the Slade, newly married to his first wife Karen, he set himself up as an artistic freelance, designing book jackets, advertisements and magazine covers - these included Graham Greene's short-lived Night and Day - and contributing to the Architectural Review, where Betjeman worked as sub-editor. <em>Progress at Pelvis Bay</em> (1936), deadpanned in the style of a municipal guidebook, was the first of several spoofs aimed at exposing the philistinism of mid-century architectural id\u00e9es fixes. The Betjeman connection paid further dividends when, after helping his friend with a series of articles for the Daily Express, he was encouraged by the features editor, John Rayner, to produce a column-width \"pocket cartoon\", a commonplace in French newspapers but not yet exported to England. The cartoons, many of them featuring Lancaster's great comic creation, Maudie, Countess of Littlehampton, caught on and continued on a daily basis for nearly 40 years.</p> <p>Lancaster's Express cartoons were his public face, but it would be a mistake to mark him down as simply an exceptionally talented comic draughtsman. As Knox shows in his introduction, his professional beat extended far beyond Fleet Street. A wartime posting to Greece, where he served as press attach\u00e9 to the British embassy and GHQ in Athens, produced the illustrated travelogue <em>Classical Landscape with Figures</em> (1947). A friendship with the artist John Piper drew him towards costume and set design for theatre and ballet. All this makes Lancaster's precise relation to English culture of the immediate postwar period difficult to pin down. The liking for \"smartness\" and the high life was always balanced by older bohemian interests, the flights of theatrical fancy brought down to earth by newspaper routine. These are Thackerayan shadings, perhaps, emphasised by the Charterhouse connection and Lancaster's fondness for another Old Carthusian cartoonist, Thackeray's contemporary John Leech. At the heart of his work, though, lies an ability to transcend the limitations of the things - in this case the thousands of Express cartoons - for which he was best known. Studying the black-and-white drawings that illustrate <em>Classical Landscape with Figures</em>, for instance, one expects to see projections of the stylised and predominantly upper-class figures that populated the newspaper cartoons. The results - a Greek news vendor at his crowded kiosk, an Arcadian shepherd in a lambskin coat, toughs dancing in a Piraean brothel - are both wonderfully vivid and sui generis.</p> <p>One of the fascinations of the early part of <em>Cartoons and Coronets</em> is the chance to explore some of Lancaster's influences. An ink sketch of a Greek village shows traces of Edward Lear's near-eastern landscapes. There are odd hints of 30s contemporaries such as Edward Burra and Paul Nash (both of whom Lancaster admired), the occasional generalised nod to interwar surrealism. A mural executed for the Blandford Forum Crown Hotel's assembly room (1935), showing Napoleon and his military advisers surveying the English Channel, is almost Dal\u00edesque. Squat and gigantic, altogether dominating the picture's foreground, the tower from which the party (all in garishly cockaded hats) looks out resembles the basket of a hot-air balloon: there is a feeling that the conferring generals might be lofted into the air at any moment. A curious prancing figure, with weirdly elongated legs, strays ominously into the picture's eastern quadrant. Elsewhere, a self-portrait from 1947 showing the dressing-gowned artist at work in his study is not in the least like an Aubrey Beardsley while using Beardsley's technique of suggesting vast acreages of space and surface with the minimum of linear effort.</p> <p>Perhaps this is another way of saying that what really distinguishes Lancaster's work - one comparison that suggests itself is with Ronald Searle - is the originality of his line. The colour sketches of sailors' costumes for the ballet <em>Pineapple Poll</em>, adapted from WS Gilbert's \"Bab Ballads\" and staged at Sadler's Wells in 1951, have exactly this kind of spatial awareness. The design for a pair of trousers, for example, picked out in parallel red lines, produces a kind of horseshoe effect. Most striking of all, though, is a group of four colour illustrations, each an ironical salute to the achievements of a particular Lancaster friend, commissioned by the Strand magazine in 1947. In the first, \"Mr John Betjeman, awaiting inspiration and the 4.47 from Didcot\", Betjeman looks practically vampiric: sallow, unshaven, hugely accentuated black eyebrows like a pair of caterpillars, shoes like glistening torpedoes, grimly exhaling a whiff of sinister white breath. The second, \"Freya Stark explaining to a relatively unsophisticated audience the genius of Mr Norman Hartnell\" (Hartnell was then at the height of his success as a couturier), is a study in contrasting facial expressions. The \"relatively unsophisticated audience\" is a congregation of Bedouin tribesmen. Stark, who sits in their midst, carmine-fingered, with her legs drawn up beneath her, is demurely confidential; the gesticulating listeners are agog. Again, the folds and contours of their costumes are merely suggested, huge expanses of white given shape and depth by the faintest of traceries. To the right, a sleeping camel still manages to look faintly sardonic.</p> <p>Then comes \"Benjamin Britten\", done in profile against a background of staves, with the superimposed outline of a piano on which the composer plays. \"Mr John Piper enjoys his usual ill luck with the weather\", in which the artist attempts to paint <em>en plein air</em> in the middle of a cloudburst, is perhaps the most extraordinary of all. Piper - angular, white-haired, with impossibly sloping shoulders - is lost in ascetic self-absorption. The background looks like a surrealist lunar shore, where it wouldn't be wonderful to find a grandfather clock marching among the waves. Everything is arranged at a slant, the rain sweeping in like tracer-fire to follow the angle to which Piper's head is inclined and the position of the knee drawn up to support his sketching pad.</p> <p>In his obituary sketch, Powell notes that \"many of Osbert's jokes were first-rate, altogether original ... \" If nothing else, <em>Cartoons and Coronets</em> is a testimony to his sense of humour. In the section called \"Jeux and Christmas Cards\", Knox reproduces a colour sketch titled \"After Breakfast at Kelmscott\", inspired by a visit Lancaster and Betjeman had paid to William Morris's house in Oxfordshire and the discovery of an earth closet with three wooden seats. Here Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, trousers around their ankles, sit flanking Janey Morris, who is daintily sewing stitches into an embroidery tambour. But a joke, in Lancaster's work, is never simply a joke: there is nearly always some deeper satiric impulse boiling away beneath it, above all an awareness of the social and historical contexts in which some of the best jokes get made. <em>The Littlehampton Bequest</em>, an elaborate spoof exhibition staged at the National Portrait Gallery under Roy Strong's direction in 1973, is a series of artistic parodies, in which the history of the Littlehampton family and its ramifications are encapsulated by paintings in the style of well-known artists of the day.</p> <p>Thus Lancaster has Zoffany taking off \"Joseph Grumble Esq\", the father-in-law of the third earl, an East India nabob pictured glaring from his gout stool against a background of minarets; and Marcellus Laroon depicting \"Vanessa, Countess of Littlehampton and her daughters\", the caption helpfully explaining that \"the wife of the first earl was heiress to half the plantations of the West Indies. She is portrayed with her two daughters and her page Hasdrubal, who in her widowhood was 'always about her person'.\" Hasdrubal, seen simpering over the coffee pot, is clearly the father of the second daughter. The final portrait, \"Basil Cantilever Esq and Lady Patricia Cantilever\", daughter and son-in-law of the present earl, mimics early Hockney. Significantly, Basil is an MP-cum-property developer, busy despoiling City churches to put up office blocks.</p> <p>Lancaster was knighted in 1975 - the photograph taken outside Buckingham Palace makes him seem the dernier cri in Old Bufferdom - then, in 1978, his career was in effect ended by the first in a series of strokes. He endured a miserable eight-year decline, nobly attended by his second wife, Anne. Powell, visiting them in their Chelsea flat in 1982 (\"Osbert in poor shape\"), noted her eagerness to take him to his next appointment: \"She insisted on driving me to the Travellers, no doubt just to get half an hour out of the house, which must be claustrophobic to a degree.\" It would be overstating the case to say that Lancaster's work is forgotten. On the other hand, the forms in which he achieved his fame - daily cartoons, set designs - have a built-in obsolescence, while the sheer scope of his work tends to frustrate an attempt to view his achievements as a whole. Between them, however, the centenary exhibition and Knox's book-length celebration contain enough evidence to establish him as one of the great English comic artists of the 20th century.</p> <p>\u2022 Cartoons and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster is at the Wallace Collection, London W1 (020 7563 9500), until January 11 2009.

  "<p>Do authorship and insomnia go hand in hand? I often wonder if for other writers, as for me, three in the morning is the time when a second self pursues an alternative agenda. Before dawn I jot down stranger versions of the book that I'm writing by day. I work through a less rational reading list. It's no time to pick up a new book, but the contents of an old one can appear startling. I try to follow the whims of my sleepwalking self. The book it leads me to usually has something to tell me.</p> <p>This week I sleepwalked to <em>A Doctor's Life: The Diaries of Hugh Selbourne MD 1960-63</em>. This diary records, in the terse fashion of a man with little spare time, three driven, harassed years in the life of a hospital consultant. Hugh Selbourne was an inveterate journal keeper and this selection from his writing was edited by his son David, the writer and political commentator. We can't guess at the diarist's intentions; in his worst moments he thought his words would never be read, let alone published. So, constraints are off. Uncensored opinions are expressed and the writer himself, in all his irascible selfhood, takes us by the sleeve and furnishes us with an uncalculated account of his life and times. </p> <p>Selbourne's background was unusual. Jewish, he was born in 1906 in Montmartre, and when the first world war broke out his parents moved to England and settled in the East End. They were not well-off, but both sons became doctors. By the time of writing, he was practising in \"Lowry-land\"; he acted as consultant to a group of hospitals in Hyde, Ashton and Glossop, those conurbations on the fringes of Manchester where moorland runs into grim terrace streets. It's fraught terrain, with an intricate and fascinating industrial history - yet famous, post-industrially, for nothing but the Moors murders and Harold Shipman. It's where I grew up, and this must be the reason I bought the book when Jonathan Cape published it in 1989. I have an inability to fully believe in the village where I was born, and when I was a child, if I found it on a map, I would stare and stare, squashing the name under my finger: there it is in print, so it must be real. In the days of Selbourne's diary, Pennine fogs rolled in to meet industrial smog; it seemed possible to me that one day the locale would simply dematerialise, the exit roads thinning into celestial ether. </p> <p>The diarist was a hard-headed man with no doubt about the material stuff of his surroundings; this is a diary about fine cigars and bad food, blotchy medical reports badly typed by recalcitrant secretaries, and the contents, sometimes threatened by damp, of his \"lumber room\". His passion is for antiquarian books, and he owns them by the yard; we are not talking about first editions of Dickens, but first editions of Erasmus, \"printed Basle, 1517\". His regular beat takes him to his private consulting rooms at St John Street in the centre of Manchester, then to Shaw's, the book dealer, and then to Sherratt &amp; Hughes bookshop, to pick up an armful of whatever is newly published. He comes home from a hard day to change into black tie and go to the theatre. The Manchester Guardian is the one constant in his busy days. He views television with the gravitas he brings to every activity, and records the weekly topics of Panorama. He is alert, insatiably curious, sardonic; in his diaries at least, he is not introspective. He is attuned always to the outside world, recording in his imperturbable way earthquakes in Chile, tidal waves in Japan, frequent air crashes with massive fatalities, as well as his spats with obstreperous motor mechanics and student nurses who fall asleep in his lectures. The moral he draws? \"June 5th 1960: The human species is degenerating.\"</p> <p>Most of his entries are about his patients. Those stiff little Lowry figures hide terrible secrets behind their mufflers: cancers, malignant hypertension, anaemia. They have inhaled asbestos fibres and been down-wind of chemical escapes. They drink, smoke, cough blood. Bus conductors fall on them, and knock them \"cock-eyed\" with their ticket machines. Bales of cotton tumble from lorries and bowl them over. Selbourne is a noted diagnostician; a GP diagnoses \"a sense of inadequacy\" in a man he at once suspects has multiple sclerosis. GPs and the patients themselves often blame their illness on the weather, which does indeed seem to be the general, implacable enemy: \"slush and snow, frost and cold\". Midsummer day, 1962 brings \"severe gales\", and August bank holiday of the same year \"rain, cloud, gloom and depression\". There is the odd ray of sunshine: June 15 1961 \"had mangoes with Indian doctors\". </p> <p>By the time he wrote these diaries Selbourne was a grandfather. He loved his children and he wanted to control them. The editor has not censored out his old self; his father disinherited him at one point, and described him as \"bearded and devoid of ambition\". Selbourne was pessimistic about his profession, his patients and the NHS - which he saw as a necessary service for poor people, not as a force for equality. He keeps on working through ferocious angina attacks, gloomily jotting down his own medical facts and figures. The diaries find him on the cusp of two worlds. In these pages, Nye Bevan dies, and survivors of concentration camps visit his surgery, and in Wales there is a smallpox outbreak. But also, the diarist feeds his first parking meter, takes a drive down the M1, listens disbelieving to the news of Kennedy's assassination. His world was, I think, more cohesive than ours. He despaired of it, but he felt part of it - a citizen of a provincial city, with stern obligations to public work and to high culture. Around that culture, the net could be drawn tight, for in Manchester in those days the words \"Hall\u00e9 Orchestra\" were pronounced with the same reverence as \"Holy Ghost\", and to describe someone as an elitist was to pay them a compliment. </p> <p>When I first read the book I thought it slight, an oddity. It had not acquired the patina of a period piece; nor had I. Now I sympathise with a diarist in his 50s - much done, much more to do. French-born he may have been, but by 1961 he was not just English but a perfect northerner. \"Jan 17th: At 5.20 am, extreme <em>angor animae</em> [fear of death]. Eased off after hot tea.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday October 14 2008</strong></p> <p> <br>Information in the article below about the Isle of Man's compensation scheme for depositors was out of date. The Isle of Man now guarantees 100% of up to \u00a350,000 of net deposits, per depositor, per bank or building society. The scheme covers most individuals, including those living outside the Isle of Man, but not companies, trusts, or charities.</p> <p> </p> <p>British savers with deposits in the Channel Islands have no protection for their money if their bank goes bust.</p> <p>After the collapse of Icesave - and the failure of Iceland's deposit protection scheme - concern is growing that the tiny island tax havens will leave savers deeply exposed. </p> <p>The council of ministers on Jersey announced last week that, subject to the agreement of the island's 53 government representatives, it plans to provide a guarantee that bank deposits will be \"fully protected\" - but only for the island's 91,000 population. </p> <p>It has promised nothing about extending this to non-residents - that is with an estimated \u00a345-\u00a350bn on deposit by UK residents in Jersey alone, plus another \u00a39bn or so in Guernsey. </p> <p>It did say that the Jersey Financial Services Commission was approaching foreign bank regulators such as the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA), \"to seek to ensure that the support offered to banks extends to the Jersey branch or subsidiary\". </p> <p>Jersey and Guernsey are not members of the European Union, which means UK-based savers are not covered by any deposit protection. </p> <p>The UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) makes it clear it does not protect cash deposits in offshore accounts in either Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.</p> <p>The Isle of Man offers some protection - but well below the UK rate. It is 75% of up to \u00a320,000 of net deposits, per depositor, per bank, if the bank fails. (Deposits with building societies are not covered by any compensation scheme). The maximum compensation payable is \u00a315,000 per depositor. The scheme covers most individuals, companies and trusts who have bank accounts in the Isle of Man. </p> <p>Payment is per depositor, not per account, so each person who shares a joint account can receive compensation. But if you have more than one account with a failed bank, you won't receive more than one compensation payment. </p> <p>In the event of a bank failure, the Isle of Man government warns that savers may have to wait some time for their compensation to be paid. </p> <p>This is down to the fact that compensation is paid out of levies collected as, and when, needed from other banks in the Isle of Man - there's no standing fund of compensation collected prior to a bank failure. </p> <p>Levies are collected at a maximum of \u00a3250,000 per bank per year and, as there are a limited number of banks which pay levies, \"it may take many years for compensation to be paid to depositors\", the government adds. </p> <p>Most of Britain's leading banks have offshore operations in the Channel Islands, along with scores of foreign banks. Savers will have to rely on pledges by these banks that they will cover the liabilities if a local subsidiary fails.</p> <p>But the bigger issue is when the parent group fails - such as Landsbanki in Iceland - leaving savers with no chance of recovering their cash. </p> <p>But some will have little sympathy for the wealthy who funnel their cash into the Channel Islands to avoid tax. By the end of last year the international super-rich had stashed assets worth $491bn (\u00a3283bn) in Jersey in order to \"illegally avoid tax\", according to a report from authoritative US-based financial think-tank Tax Analysis. It emerged that Swiss bankers have increasingly used Jersey to help their clients avoid the withholding tax levied on Swiss corporate dividends. </p> <p>It is thought that up to $78bn of so-called Swiss fiduciary deposits are funnelled from their banks to Jersey in this way. But the Treasury claims it has made efforts to control tax abuse. Last year HM Revenue and Customs launched a drive against those who fail to disclose offshore accounts, which it said yielded declarations from more than 60,000 people, bringing in more than \u00a3100m in revenue.</p>",

I'm still trying to work out what my proper job should be (a psychotherapist maybe). It's just something that I love doing and I'm very lucky because people pay me to do it.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any tips for beginners? </strong></p> <p>Spend as much time as you can with the instrument and find a way to really enjoy yourself with it beyond the lessons and the scales. Experiment and find ways to connect to the sound and the feel. Find ways to discover how to have a good time with it, even how to be sad or introspective with it - if you can achieve that, then chances are you can give others a good time with the instrument.</p> <p><strong>Who are your greatest influences and inspirations?</strong></p> <p>One of the things that inspires me the most is making a connection with an audience at a really happening gig, then kind of simultaneously observing what happens; human nature at its most free and joyful, it's possible to take that scenario higher and higher to unimaginable states. It's something that is our natural heritage and yet often strangely elusive. For me its what makes the world go round. It's magic.</p> <p><strong>What encouragement would you give to someone on the verge of giving up?</strong></p> <p>Give up. Giving up music is a hugely creative thing to do, if you've come this far you'll be drawn back into it anyway. When you stop for a while you'll probably reconnect with it in a better way. If it's part of you now it will always be, and if it's only a momentary flirtation, then it's as well you realise that.</p> <p><strong>How does playing the Hammond organ affect your mood?</strong></p> <p>Performance in particular can be like plugging myself into the source of life. Alternatively, it can be bad. In either case it needs examining in retrospect so that you can learn from the experience and so broaden your understanding of music. </p> <p><strong>Do you have to be in a certain frame of mind to play well?</strong></p> <p>Anxious, focused, scared even, but a bit confident too. Playful-excited - a strange balance. If I'm not too tired and have been eating well, that helps, but the altered state required to really rip it up is definitely a slightly (or not so slightly) psychotic frame of mind.</p> <p>Some latent hurt from deep within is being accessed and worked through. Therefore, above all, it has to be real and to matter, deeply, then I can tap into a rich vein of musical energy. The worst thing is walking on stage thinking it's all cool and no big deal. Invariably you find out that it isn't.</p> <p><strong>Can you recall your most memorable on-stage moment?</strong></p> <p>My maiden voyage (my very first gig as a band leader) at a sold-out club on Shaftesbury Avenue in spring 1987. Quite a few celebs came down to check us out, several hundred people outside were unable to get tickets - no pressure then! It started badly, it was painful, awful, then, curiously beautiful. The feeling really came alive in me for the first time; it felt like something new had been born in my life that would bring me and others lots of good things.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The new album, James Taylor Quartet Live at The Jazz Cafe is out now</p>",
  "<h2>Make an air-powered boat</h2> <p>We enjoy finding new uses for items that normally get thrown away. One amusing invention is an air-powered boat made from a humble plastic water bottle, with the aid of a party balloon. The vessel doesn't have any moving parts and no tools are required. Instead of throwing your empty bottle (preferably the flat-sided sort with a sports cap) into a recycling bin, use a drawing pin or compass point to make a hole a little larger than a pinhead. It should be towards the top but below the tapered neck. </p> <p>Then the fun starts. Blow a few puffs into the balloon and, without releasing the air, attach it to the bottle's open cap. Place the bottle, punctured side down, into your pond or bath and watch it go. The air slowly bubbles through the hole, giving just enough thrust to propel the \"boat\" gently through the water, often with the accompaniment of a realistic \"phut-phut\" sound.</p> <p>It keeps young children occupied for ages, especially if you encourage them to experiment by adding weight or decorating the sides with card and crayons so it looks the part. Maybe they will get the bottle-boat bug, producing a small fleet of them for racing. Don't forget to impress everyone by stating that the exercise demonstrates Newton's third law of motion: that every action has an opposite and equal reaction.<br><strong>Bob Barton</strong></p> <h2>Celebrate 50 years of Blue Peter</h2> <p>John Noakes and his crazy exploits, Valerie Singleton and Peter Purves (or whoever it was in your generation), Shep the dog and the Blue Peter baby, excitable peeing elephants (if you haven't seen this one, watch it on You Tube) and, of course, the \"one I made earlier\". So many of us grew up with Blue Peter and now, still going strong for our kids - and their kids - it is celebrating its 50th birthday.</p> <p>There is a free exhibition opening on October 18 at the National Media Museum in Bradford. Here's One I Made Earlier: 50 Years of Blue Peter looks back over everything about Britain's most enduring children's television programme: from the first script (1958) and earliest surviving footage (1963 with Christopher Trace) to today's new presenters, Joel Defries and Helen Skelton, the pets and the appeals. </p> <p>There will be objects from the show (including badges and the nativity scene that featured on the Christmas programme for 40 years) and some of the original \"makes\" (like the famous Tracey Island). At weekends and in school holidays, the Art Cart rolls in to allow kids to do their own Blue Peter-inspired makes (a bit quicker than the originals) and museum interpreters are set to lead family talks around the exhibition. </p> <p>There are loads of clips of the show, of course, and even some Blue Peter spoofs. And in TV Heaven you can sit in your own viewing booth and watch full programmes from across the decades. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk\">nationalmediamuseum.org.uk</a>, 0870-7010200, until January 11 2009 <br><strong>Juliet Rix</strong></p> <h2>Go to the cinema for free</h2> <p>For Helen Mirren, the cinema is the only place to watch a movie. \"The lights go down, the ads are over, the logo for the film distributor comes up, and then the music kicks in. You feel everyone in the audience settle in for the ride.\" That moment, \"like quicksilver - fleeting and imaginative\", still thrills her. Yet many children - 60% in a recent survey - have only ever watched films on a TV screen.</p> <p>Which is why Mirren and half a dozen other celebs, including Eddie Izzard and Sienna Miller, are endorsing this year's National Schools Film Week. The fun begins this Friday when cinemas in Leicester Square open their doors to 4,000 children for a day of free screenings, including a preview of the animated feature, Igor.</p> <p>But anyone who missed out on the big London trip can still attend free screenings at more than 550 cinemas around the country until October 24. Just key your nearest town into nsfw.org, check what's showing, and ask a teacher to book. There are primary and secondary programmes, and resources linking each movie into the curriculum and demonstrating how film can be used to bring issues to life, are available to teachers. </p> <p>Each year, there's a chance to win a young film critic award, and anyone wishing to enter next year's competition should start taking notes on any film they watch between now and the closing date - July 17 2009 (<a href=\"http://www.youngfilmcritic.org\">youngfilmcritic.org</a>). <br><strong>David Newnham</strong></p> <h2>We came, we saw, we conkered</h2> <p>Given the number of conkers I'm finding under foot at the moment, today's children don't know about this precious, autumnal booty. If you do one thing this week, tell your children about conkers, then perhaps the venerable playground game of the same name - first recorded in 1848 - will live to see another generation. </p> <p>The fruit of the horse chestnut falls to the ground in September and October, splitting to reveal within its green spiky case, a perfect, polished brown nut. The trees, native to the Balkans, were imported in the 16th century, largely as ornamental trees, which is why you will find conkers gracing urban avenues and parks. The horse chestnut is under serious threat of disease at the moment, another reason to go searching for conkers while you can. </p> <p>When you get them home, soak them in vinegar or bake them in the oven to toughen them up. Bore a hole through the middle (younger children should obviously be supervised). Thread a piece of string, about 25cm long, through the hole. Tie a knot in the end to stop the conker falling off. </p> <p>Take turns to aim a strike at your opponent's conker (each player wraps the top bit of string around their hand; the person waiting to be bashed lets their string hang straight; the one doing the bashing swings theirs down). The first conker to break loses. If both are \"virgins\", the winner is a one-er. If you beat a one-er, you become a two-er ... the world record is held by a 5,000-er.<br><strong>Sarah Woodley</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>The Great Crash: How the Stock Market Crash of 1929 Plunged the World into Depression</strong><br>by Selwyn Parker<br>310pp, Piatkus, \u00a312.99</p> <p><strong>The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World</strong><br>by Niall Ferguson<br>397pp, Allen Lane, \u00a325</p> <p><strong>The Gods that Failed: How Blind Faith in Markets Has Cost Us Our Future</strong><br>by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson<br>326pp, The Bodley Head, \u00a312.99</p> <p>In rising financial markets, the world is forever new. The bull or optimist has no eyes for past or present, but only for the future, where streams of revenue play in his imagination. In falling markets, there is nothing that has not happened before. The bear or pessimist sees only the past, which imprisons the wretched financial soul in eternal circles of boom and bust and boom again. </p> <p>Bulls don't read. Bears read financial history. As markets fall to bits, the bears dust off the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, the Banque Royale of 1719-20, the railway speculation of the 1840s, the great crash of 1929. Leering phantoms emerge from the historical dark, like the parade of ghostly Scottish kings in Macbeth: John Law, Clarence Hatry, Jesse Livermore, Charles E Mitchell, Robert C Merton and Myron S Scholes. The bears trace in Alan Greenspan the indulgence of Andrew Mellon, and descry in George W Bush the weakness of Herbert Hoover. </p> <p>As John Merriwether, the banker who brought Long-Term Capital Management to grief in 1998, said: \"If I had lived through the depression, I would have been in a better position to understand events.\" Or, as Niall Ferguson writes, \"The average career of a Wall Street CEO is just over 25 years, which means that first-hand memories at the top of the US banking system do not extend back beyond 1983. That fact alone provides a powerful justification for the study of financial history.\"</p> <p>Cause and effect, the riddle of all history, is a particular devil in financial history; and never more so than today, where entire classes of security are collapsing not on public exchanges and stock-tickers but because there are no markets to establish prices this side of nothing. In the most straightforward of these books, Selwyn Parker goes for a causality of dominoes and billiard balls, as in this magnificent passage on the progress of the great depression in his native New Zealand: </p> <p>'This was a nation that lived off the sheep's back and the cows' udders. Entire country towns depended for their prosperity on profits from big grazing estates and dairy farms. As overseas earnings declined in the general blockade of trade, men were being laid off meat-slaughtering lines in giant meat freezing works. Woollen mills slowed to half-pace. Ships started to leave the ports half-empty. State-owned railways freighted less and less cargo. Dairy factories processed less milk. Sales at the nationwide farmers' cooperatives - retailers suppling everything from grass seed and weedkillers to bush shirts and gumboots - rapidly collapsed. Country pubs dispensed less beer and city brewers laid off staff.'</p> <p>Ferguson, a Scots professor at Harvard more attuned to philosophical fashion, invokes chaos theory to explain how the prospect of default on self-cert mortgages to African-Americans on Detroit's West Outer Drive causes a bank run in Newcastle upon Tyne. \"The subprime butterfly had flapped its wings and triggered a global hurricane.\" This is a sort of dehumanised version of Burke: \"A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almost of Nature.\" For Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, economics editors of this newspaper and the Mail on Sunday respectively, financial history is the unfolding of moral law of a popular or commonsense character. Their Gods that Failed are not just the City and Wall Street and various other citizens that annoy them but, in a smart rhetorical manouevre, certain copy-book moral failings: speculation, recklessness, greed, arrogance, oligarchy and excess. </p> <p>Parker's book is a good account of the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the resulting worldwide depression as banks failed, credit contracted, tariff barriers were erected and the volume of world trade fell by two-thirds. His narrative takes us to out of the way places somewhat ignored in the standard accounts of those events, most notably JK Galbraith's The Great Crash: 1929 (1955). Here are not just New Zealand and Australia, but Newfoundland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Hawaii, Bengal, Scotland. Unfortunately, what we really rather badly need to know this week is not the price of jute in Calcutta in 1931 but the precise chain of events that caused 10,000 bank failures in the US between 1929 and 1933 (much better in Ferguson) and the success or not of the depression-era precursor of the Paulson plan, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Parker was not to know that. </p> <p>Ferguson's reputation is so high that if he were a stock one would short him. The very title of his book, The Ascent of Money, is a screaming sell signal, like the shoe-shine boys trading stock tips at the door to Grand Central Station in New York in 1929. In fairness, Ferguson recognises that and his pages are hot with proof-stage tyre-marks, as he goes into violent reverse to escape from under collapsing arguments. None the less, his book is very readable indeed and the television series for which it is a sort of trailer, will, I am sure, be even better. </p> <p>Ferguson believes money was invented to record and discharge debts, and he passes rather quickly on to the rise of banking in the Middle Ages, the issue by governments of annuities and other bonds, the origins of insurance and the establishment of joint-stock companies. As with all economist-historians, Ferguson's soul is at war with itself. History tells him there is such a thing as history. Economics tells him there is none, for everything is always and ever subject to unvarying laws (which just happened not to be discovered till the other day).</p> <p>The result is that the book is not very interesting until it approaches our times. No philologer, Ferguson assumes pecunia means money in the sense that money means money. His account of the rococo Scottish financier John Law and his Banque Royale of 1719-20, based on no source older than 1969 and none in French, shows absolutely no feeling whatever for the character of his great countryman or the manners and laws of the French regency.</p> <p>Yet Ferguson really understands the Rothschilds, and the 19th century in general, and he writes a long and marvellous chapter on the growth of house ownership as a civic right and the rise of mortgage finance. It was the depression itself that created the home-owning ideology and the credit institutions to pay for it, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association or Fanny Mae (which has just had to be rescued). </p> <p>Here is Ferguson on It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the film starring James Stewart that sentimentalised mortgage finance: \"Jimmy Stewart knew both the depositors and the debtors. By contrast, in a securitised market (just like in space) no one can hear you scream - because the interest you pay on your mortgage is ultimately going to someone who has no idea you exist.\"</p> <p>His account of Long-Term Capital Management, in which academic economists thought they had understood the secret workings of markets and came spectacularly to grief, made me laugh out loud. Ferguson is by temperament and breeding a financial Stoic, to whom all financial phenomena, however repellent or terrifying, have been designed by the Comptroller of the Universe for the prosperity of the whole. It is a hard philosophy for these times. </p> <p>The Gods that Failed is raucous and very likeable. The contention of its two authors is that Britain has fallen in the past 40 years under the sway of something they call, in an echo of Swift, the \"financial interest\". The bankers and financiers, chained up after the second world war by exchange control, high and selective taxation, bank regulation and social parsimony, gradually broke their bounds. They were secretly assisted by a lurid and deep-laid conspiracy of philosophers such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman and, in a most interesting dialectical twist, by the breakdown of traditional authority in the social movements of 1968. </p> <p>Elliott and Atkinson sticks pins into the usual pin-cushions, from Greenspan to the Davos conference and the geniuses at LTCM. I was less clear as to precisely how the City is responsible for the closing of sub post-offices, the government's project for identity cards, city-centre CCTV, council equality officers, disruption in the National Health Service, restrictions on the smoking of tobacco in public and the general form of government the authors call \"nagocracy\". Middle Britain may well have been conned, as Elliott and Atkinson claim, but surely it is not only by the financial interest. I suppose this is is how the Guardian can drink with Mail on Sunday without coming to blows. </p> <p>Through it all is that British nostalgia for manufacturing industry. Factories, for these authors as for the Edwardians, represent national wealth of a more solid or steady kind than dealing rooms at Canary Wharf. The destruction of manufacturing is a sort of proximate cause of the credit boom that threatens to bring our nation to grief. \"An unproductive economy, asset-stripped of most of the resources that would have enabled it to pay its way in the world, was unable to provide the level of earnings to which the public and the government felt entitled. The obvious, if dangerous, answer was to borrow the difference.\" </p> <p>It is all a little overdone. Where, in this parade of cartoon financial villains, is Frank McGarahan of Barclays Wealth who gave his well-remunerated life last week to protect a homeless Lithuanian by the Guildhall in Norwich? Not all lending is predatory. It was not just the financial interest that turned my country neighbours into buy-to-let landlords. What has happened to Caveat debitor: let the borrower take care! As for Mrs Watanabe, the archetypal Asian saver, who paid for this British rural speculation, Caveat creditrix: let the lender beware! Lenders hungry for yield meet borrowers thirsting for social advancement. They combine. And detonate.</p> <p>Elliot and Atkinson demand that in return for the benefit of limited liability and the protection of courts and police, the financial interest must submit to public control. Their seven-point plan comprises balance-sheet controls, separating retail banking from securities, limits on size, licensing of derivatives, industrial \"champions\" \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, targeted taxation of bankers and cutting red tape for non-financial companies. </p> <p>These proposals have been overtaken by events. Instead of smaller banks, the wave of forced mergers is throwing up behemoths of the extent and character of the projected Lloyds-HBOS and Citi-Wachovia. Even liberal writers have embraced nationalisation. If banks cannot be permitted to fail, then their liabilities (as Martin Wolf of the Financial Times was musing last week) were perhaps always and only ever contingent liabilities of the public. If, to continue the argument, we are every one of us on the hook for the money the bankers have borrowed, then by God or Ford we will have something to say about how they speculate with it. What is at risk is not merely our prosperity but our liberty. In his first proposal to Congress, Paulson demanded dictatorial powers. As Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee put it: \"I can only conclude that it is not just our economy that is at risk but our constitution.\" </p> <p>Parker ends optimistically: \"We are smarter than we were in the 1930s,\" which you can believe or not, best not. I am certainly not smarter than my father or grandfather. Ferguson ends with a chapter, strongly influenced by Schumpeter and Darwin, which describes financial markets as evolutionary, marked as he puts it by Cambrian Expansions and Great Extinctions. It is bravura Ferguson, supremely self-confident, demotic or even pubby, and ending at a point that is the precise reverse of observable reality: \"The only species that is now close to extinction in the developed world is the state-owned bank.\" (The tyre-mark here is: \"though the nationalisation of Northern Rock suggests the species is not quite dead\".)</p> <p>For myself, I have been struck by something I read about the market for credit default swaps, a species of bond insurance that ballooned into one of the greatest speculations of all time. Here is Gerald Corrigan, a managing director of Goldman Sachs and at some-time president of the New York Federal Reserve: \"An effort has been under way since the spring to net down offsetting CDS trades thereby reducing the notational amounts of such trades outstanding. The results have been dramatic. Between April and August, the notional value of dealer and client index trade at the the Depositary Trust Company was almost cut in half from $30,000bn to about $16,000bn. As the effort extends to single-name trades, further dramatic progress is expected.\" Those trillions, that could destroy the world, net out to zero. We are in a sort of financial cold war in which instruments of immense destructive power must be negotiated out of existence. </p> <p>\u2022 James Buchan's books include Frozen Desire: The Meaning of Money.

  "<p>With their trendy, sensationalist posturing, Hunt and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were the Young British Artists of Victorian times. Even knowing that a painting of a maiden swooning over a pot of basil is an illustration to a Keats verse, it's hard to stifle a snigger. A flushed-cheeked shepherd chats up a buxom wench as his flock chomps away at a background pasture of unearthly emerald. Elsewhere, Christ comes on like some dolled-up hippy, replete with head-shop candle lantern. It's easy to be cynical about the fanciful conceits of Pre-Raphaelite painting, yet Hunt's The Light Of The World was viewed by 7 million fans as it toured the British Empire in the early 1900s.

  "<p>Mark Innocenti, a 26-year-old commercial surveyor from London, lost his job last month. He joined recruitment agencies and attended interviews but, with the construction industry completely crunched by credit and the banking crisis, found hundreds of people scrabbling for the same position. As Britain slips towards a dangerous recession, he has taken a radical decision: letting his home, selling his car and scrimping and saving to pay \u00a39,000 to take a masters degree at a university in Australia.</p> <p>Every day, stupefying sums of money are wiped from stock exchanges across the globe and taxpayers' billions are spent propping up faltering banks. Bewildered ordinary people are left worrying how this market chaos will affect them. With the transformation of the economic landscape, many feel compelled to alter their own lives in a new search for security. Tales of citydwellers stockpiling tins of beans and heading for the hills may have the whiff of urban myth, but life overshadowed by the prospect of a recession is already taking drastic or curious turns. Couples are deciding they can't afford children, downsizing to live in caravans or taking their houses off-grid; pensioners are buying safes in which to stash savings whipped out of the banks.</p> <p>Innocenti hopes his foreign degree will increase his chances of finding work in Australia, at least until the building industry recovers in the UK. Another friend in the industry has already relocated to Abu Dhabi. \"People are looking to go to Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai,\" Innocenti says.</p> <p>Emigration specialists report a huge surge in people seeking to move overseas.

She is now inundated with homeowners - 200 a week, compared with two a week in April - unable to sell their houses and attracted by the idea of a guaranteed sale price based on official valuations.</p> <p>Sam Donaldson, an orthopaedic technician, says if all the auction seats are sold she will receive the price she would have got for her house six months ago; the winner will buy the house for far below its market value. Then, she and her husband and 10-year-old son will relocate to Perth, western Australia. </p> <p>\"I could easily find work in Australia but I'm stuck here with this house,\" she says. \"We came off our fixed-rate mortgage and are now paying a variable rate which has gone up. It's now \u00a32,700 a month. It's a lovely area but we're not enjoying the house because we resent paying that money.\"</p> <p>Hull City may be storming football's Premier League but that feelgood factor is too little too late for Paul Carmichael and his young family, who are moving to Australia in search of greater job security. Carmichael, 36, last week accepted an offer on his three-bedroom house in Hull of nearly \u00a320,000 less than its initial asking price, fearing it would only lose more value if he waited.</p> <p>For years he has helped build up a small family business making resin floors for factories but work has dried up. \"Everybody is spending less and it's now fix and make do, rather than buy new flooring,\" Carmichael says. \"You hear about manufacturing in the UK. What do we make now? It doesn't seem like there is going to be the level of security for the next 20 or 30 years until I retire that I assumed there would be.\"</p> <p>While he accepts that Australia will be suffering from elements of the same global downturn, he believes its stronger manufacturing sector benefits from the country's proximity to China. \"Australia has an expanding population and plenty of space to build new factories,\" he says. \"The way things are going I think we're getting out at the right time especially when banks are starting to collapse.\"</p> <p>Living without mains electricity, gas or water may once have been a middle-class, environmental idea. But it is increasingly motivated by more pressing financial imperatives. Nick Rosen, the author of How to Live Off-Grid, says traffic to his blog has risen by 30%-40% this month and interest has \"intensified\" owing to fear and a lack of credit. \"People are particularly interested in small houses and sheds - looking at where they are going to go if they can't pay their rent or if they get evicted. That wasn't on the agenda a month ago.\"</p> <p>Other eco-friendly habits are spreading because of economic fears. More than 60,000 UK residents are now members of car-sharing schemes such as Streetcar. It has 40,000 members and membership is growing 40% faster than earlier in the year.</p> <p>Apart from selling their cars or securing their homes, the recession-hit are also seeking more secure jobs. James Carter is one of an increasing number of former City workers retraining as teachers. A headhunter, the 29-year-old left his job this year and is now four weeks into a PGCE at the Institute of Education in London, after which he will become a secondary school science teacher. </p> <p>\"A factor in my final decision was a lack of security in the City, as well as wanting something less repetitive that would also help people more,\" he says. Looking at struggling former colleagues now, \"almost makes you think, thank goodness I got out for the right reasons and actually have a career rather than just worrying about where the next sale is coming from.\"</p> <p>The search for security is also preoccupying those lucky enough to have savings. Reports of worried savers frantically closing their bank accounts and stashing their money under mattresses may be exaggerated although research by the market and consumer research firm Mintel shows just 16% of adults trust a major high street bank brand compared with 33% last year. </p> <p>Anthony Neary, of online retailer <a href=\"http://www.thesafeshop.co.uk\">The Safe Shop</a>, reports a flurry of concerned callers this week after an expected sales increase in September: \"Every other caller is someone saying, 'I want to take my money out of the bank.' It has definitely become an issue now. People see the government's rescue package is not making a difference to share prices and so they don't trust it now.\"</p> <p>Fears over disappearing savings, falling share and property prices is creating a boom in the gold trade, as people look for what they perceive to be a safe bet. While the phones at BullionVault, an online gold broker in west London, \"lit up\" after Northern Rock collapsed last year, according to Adrian Ash, head of research, interest in the precious metal has gone through the roof in the past month. \"The interest in buying gold at the moment is just phenomenal. Yesterday we opened 1,400 new online accounts, which is three times our previous record set the week before.\"</p> <p>Frank Cochran, 50, the founder of an investment company from Wolverhampton, sold a house he owned in Portugal three months ago. Rejecting offers to invest in everything from coffee to orange juice he put his money into a gold fund instead. \"In times of trouble, the one thing people always run to is gold. We're going into a period where the UK could go into deflation and in a deflationary climate, precious metals hold their value,\" he says. \"People are starting to question the wisdom of investing in banks and building societies. Alistair Darling has said he will guarantee up to \u00a350,000 in individual savings accounts but if it all goes terribly wrong does the government stand a chance of paying it back to everyone?\"</p> <p>Worried investors are also lodging their life savings in liquid: fine wine retailers report brisk business. \"People are attracted to wine as an investment because it is a tangible asset and over the long term it almost always performs strongly,\" says Joss Fowler at wine merchant Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, where sales are up 5% on this time last year.</p> <p>When it comes to spending, people are not just cutting back on luxuries such as holidays or beauty treatments. Richard Lee, a leading cosmetic dentist in London, says many clients are not only postponing cosmetic work \"while they sort out their finances\" but also cancelling routine check-ups because of job insecurity and the fear their boss would notice they were not in the office. </p> <p>\"Over the last three or four weeks things have been a lot quieter,\" says Lee. \"People are concerned and worried and don't want to be seen to be out of the office. Talking to colleagues in London, everyone is pretty quiet at the moment.\"</p> <p>When people do dare leave their desks, there is plenty of evidence that they are eating more modestly. Sales of the humble mackerel are up by 76% in Waitrose in recent weeks, while Allinson reports sales of bread making and culinary flour have risen by more than 50% in the last month. Pubs are having to adapt: The Pigs in Edgefield, Norfolk, is running a bartering scheme whereby locals can bring in vegetables from their gardens and exchange them for pints or meals. \"If you grow, breed, shoot or steal anything that may look at home on our menu, bring it in and let's do a deal,\" says a sign at the pub. The Swan Inn in North Petherton, Somerset, has introduced a BYO food rule so customers cutting down on eating out \"can bring their own food in so they can have a drink while they eat it\", says its landlady, Julie Barnard. \"We did do food and had a full time chef but it just wasn't feasible to carry on.\"</p> <p>This pervasive insecurity and uncertainty is even reaching deep into people's personal lives. Claire Blakemore, a senior solicitor at the law firm Withers, says many divorces are in \"limbo\" because financial volatility is seeing people's asset values vary hugely each day. </p> <p>\"People can't sell or remortage their properties, so reaching a final settlement becomes more problematic. Some couples are having to stay living under the same roof because their liquid assets have been reduced and they can't afford to move out,\" she says. \"At the moment we are confronted by a lot of bankers who are fearful of committing themselves to a settlement that they think they may not be able to afford if the financial crisis continues.\"</p>",

  "<p>Late in the 19th century, a Philadelphian named Frederick W Taylor toured the smoky foundries and clattering mills of his day carrying a stopwatch and a clipboard. Taylor measured the workers' movements and routines, and then came up with schemes to deploy them more efficiently. It was the birth of \"scientific management\". Over the following decades, it extended its reach, evolving from rudimentary improvements at shipyards along the river Tyne to the clock-like precision of Toyota production lines in Derbyshire. For factory workers, labouring under the boss's gaze and stopwatch has long been part of the job.</p> <p>But Taylor's successors have had trouble moving into \"knowledge\" industries. It's far easier, after all, to count the revolutions of a lathe than the generation of ideas. This keeps the focus in office work on results, not process. Sell a house, win a trial, wow the boss with elegant lines of software code - and the particulars of how you do your job don't count against you. This is in great part because they haven't been counted.</p> <p>Until now. These days, the omnipresent office computer records and times every keystroke and mouse click. It keeps track of every web page visited. Phone logs and emails define each worker's network of connections. Companies own this avalanche of information produced on their machines by labourers in their employ. And some are starting to realise that by studying the patterns of office workers, they can glean insights about their operations and their employees. They've found their 21st-century stopwatch and clipboard. And they're counting on an elite cast of mathematicians and computer scientists - people I call the numerati - to help them automate management.</p> <p>Three years ago, at IBM's Watson Research Centre, north of New York city, a team of 40 numerati embarked on an ambitious mission, converting reams of worker data into mathematical models of 50,000 of the company's employees. Modelling was nothing new. For decades, mathematicians have been building models of the physical world, from jet wings to nuclear bombs - working with these simulations is cheaper and more efficient (not to mention safer) than creating the real thing. But only in the internet age, with employees producing rivers of data, would they dare to attempt modelling knowledge workers.</p> <p>Samer Takriti, a Syrian-born mathematician, headed the project for two years (before leaving Big Blue last year for a top maths job at Goldman Sachs). Speaking in his office at the Watson lab, Takriti admitted that it was no easy job to model humans. Unlike machines they get depressed, they feud and fall in love, they lie and drink and come up with great and transformative ideas. Perhaps most importantly though, they figure out systems designed to control them - and work to turn them to their own advantage. In other words, IBM's 50,000 consultants (who are no dummies) would probably learn to doctor their calendar items, web-surfing patterns and emails to produce the most flattering possible mathematical facsimiles of themselves.</p> <p>But even if IBM's models are subject to such manipulation, the data promises plenty of insights into workers' behaviour. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have found that the patterns of emails, for example, describe each worker's place in the group. They can pick out the active networkers, the brown-nosers (who send blind copies to their supervisors), and the so-called \"outliers\" - people who don't seem to be communicating with anyone. </p> <p>What's up with them? Kathleen Carley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, says they are more likely to be unhappy, preparing to quit, or even passing on inside information to rivals.</p> <p>If employers choose to study the words contained in emails, they can learn even more. One marketing research company in Colorado, Umbria Communications, feeds millions of blog posts every day to its computers, which can instantly calculate the gender and approximate age of each blogger, as well as their opinions about a host of consumer products. </p> <p>Looking at the positive side, a similar analysis of emails in a company could line up workers with distant colleagues who have similar interests or expertise. On the downside, though, managers could easily run a battery of tests. They could calculate, for example, the productivity of the 10% of workers who most often refer to \"beer\" or \"football\" in their emails, or even those who express negative views about the company. (IBM says that it does not analyse employees' emails. But other companies do, especially in the banking industry.)</p> <p>In the short term, here's how IBM's mathematical models work. Managers assembling a team for a global assignment - for example, launching a call centre in the Far East - type in the prerequisites. The system then automatically scans thousands of workers and suggests the ideal team. These are people who appear to work well together, live near the right airports, have the right language and technical skills - and come in under budget. </p> <p>In the old days, says Takriti, managers would make calls or ask around the hallways when putting together such teams. But such a rolodex approach comes up short in a global business with 300,000 workers. Managements in giant companies increasingly need something closer resembling a search engine. To be found and managed in such a system, workers must be described as mathematical symbols.</p> <p>For consultants at the top of their profession, this automation might sound demeaning. But IBM cannot afford to treat them like one of Frederick Taylor's micro-managed welders, lest they take their valuable skills and knowhow to more human competitors. No, IBM's models must make room for happiness. Job satisfaction, in the language of engineers, is one of the system's \"constraints\". A boring assignment? Save the star the aggravation and give it to someone else. </p> <p>And yet this mathematical management won't be nearly as considerate of lower-level employees. By Takriti's reckoning, so-called commodity workers produce razor-thin profit margins. This means they must be worked as close as possible to 100% of their working hours. Clearly, by the remorseless logic of the numerati, those who do simple jobs will either be replaced by machines or treated like machines by the machines managing them.</p> <p>Once automatic systems gain control of workers' skills, routines and schedules, the next step is to break them into smaller pieces. At least that's what Pierre Haren believes. Haren, the founder of France's iLog, a logistics analysis company recently bought by IBM, predicts that workers' days will be broken down into hours, half-hours, and eventually minutes. At the same time, the jobs to be done, whether building a software program or putting together a class-action suit, will also be broken into tiny steps - much like the factory work Taylor dissected all those years ago. As the system taps their expertise, minute by minute, knowledge workers assume their positions on a global assembly line. \"This is the equivalent of the industrial revolution for white-collar workers,\" Haren says.</p> <p>This may sound like a puppet show with the numerati pulling the strings. But in the workplace Takriti describes, there's room for everyone. Indeed, even as they model their colleagues, the maths whizzes on the IBM team are producing rich data trails of their own. If IBM's automation yields the expected efficiencies, the numerati themselves one day will be described mathematically and assume their posts in the global assembly line. </p> <p>\u2022 The Numerati, by Stephen Baker, is published next month by Jonathan Cape at \u00a317.99.</p>",
  "<p>It's awful that the downturn has wiped one-fifth off retirement funds (Report, October 8). Pensions pundits are wringing their hands and looking for a scapegoat. They should look in the mirror. We got in this mess because bankers took huge risks for huge rewards from schemes based on short-term profits and inflated share prices.

  "<p>A number of your commentators and editorials have urged the \"curbing\" of City bonuses this year. What does this mean? Instead of the usual, say, \u00a310m bonus, will \u00a31m now be acceptable?</p> <p>However, none of your commentators has suggested that the City bankers, derivative traders etc should repay the bonuses they awarded themselves in previous years. Presumably the present financial catastrophe has been brewing for quite a few years, while these people have been awarding themselves enormous sums - last year the total bonuses amounted to \u00a313.7bn, I believe (Report, June 25). Surely this amounts to obtaining money under false pretences - they have pretended to be creating \"wealth\" for the nation, while actually behaving in a wholly irresponsible, incompetent and possibly criminal manner to enrich themselves alone, and undermining the real economy.</p> <p>A real Labour government would immediately pass legislation that would allow it to fine these people an amount equal to their previous bonuses. The money so obtained from assorted tax havens etc could then be used to prevent repossession of houses and create employment for those whose jobs are about to disappear in the coming recession. One year of City bonuses would bootstrap a renewable energy industry, another year of bonuses would fund the creation of a national electric car industry, and so on, creating hundreds of thousands of really useful jobs.<br><strong>Dave Hookes</strong><br>Liverpool </p> <p>You report that the government has no concrete plans as to how to rein in executive pay (Huge bonuses for City high flyers will be hard to rein in, October 10), but there is already one obvious mechanism: taxation. For decades the tax system has been crying out for reform, so that salaries, excessive bonuses and share-allocation perks are properly taxed at, say 50%. In addition, the use of tax havens must be better regulated, for example by insisting that all income earned in the UK should be fully taxed here, no matter where the mogul lives.</p> <p>I do not mind if some people earn a lot of money, so long as I can see that the country is getting a fair slice of it in tax. The problem is that both Tory and Labour administrations have manifestly failed to ensure that the system is fair.<br><strong>Dr Stephen Bax</strong><br>Canterbury Christ Church University </p> <p>We have been told for years that the UK was a centre of excellence for financial services and that huge City bonuses were the price needed to retain talent. Now we are in the middle of a financial crisis largely precipitated by the myopic greed of this grotesquely overpaid \"talent\". Today you report one fund manager claiming that \"if London becomes badly paid there will be an exodus to Mumbai\". Why is this a problem? If India wants to let these fools and knaves wreck their economy, good luck to them.<br><strong>Chris Webster</strong><br>Abergavenny, Monmouthshire </p> <p>Mervyn King has not had a good crisis. If it is time (as it surely is) for some bank directors to walk, shouldn't he lead the way? Doesn't this highlight another gap in the rescue plan? Why should the chancellor (hopefully) gain the influence to tell others to fall on their swords but leave the governor untouchable? I hope Gordon Brown now regrets making the Bank of England independent.<br><strong>Professor John MacInnes</strong><br>University of Edinburgh </p> <p>Along with a number of commentators, the Guardian seems to think that irrationality is somehow fuelling the meltdown in global markets (Report, October 10). The serious share price drops are put down to \"panic selling\", \"fear\" and a \"lack of confidence\". </p> <p>Perhaps the reason is that most people realise their shares are going to be virtually worthless in six months' time and that the companies whose shares they hold are likely to have disappeared off the map. Rather than the future being \"uncertain\", it is very likely that both market and general economic conditions will continue to deteriorate rapidly for the foreseeable future. You would be crazy not to cut and run. It is the only rational and logical thing to do.<br><strong>Tony Prince</strong><br>Leicester</p>",
  "<p>The day there was cardiac arrest on the stock exchange, with carnage in every market, was also the day How to Spend It slipped out between the crisp pink sheets of the Financial Times. This was the magazine's well-timed Bonus Issue. Oh joy! Here is the zeitgeist publication of the last reckless decade.</p> <p>\"Now may not seem the best time to be taking financial risks, but isn't gambling exactly what City traders do best?\" starts an article on a new equity fund buying racehorses. Turn the page to wander round the wine cellar of Sir Stuart Rose, boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, whose collection is \"a thing of beauty\".</p> <p>What tempts the jaded palate this week? How about the first watch designed for spacewalking at \u00a316,000, tailored for a zillionaire who spent \u00a330m to be an amateur astronaut. Your own genuine flight simulator costs \u00a39m. Stuck for an executive gift? Here's an \u00a38,500 sterling silver golf club. The extraordinarily sensitive ears of the hyper-rich might need a hi-fi costing \u00a3199,999 (not including stands).</p> <p>You thought it was all over? Not a bit of it, nor will it be for supersonic wealth. If, like Michael Spencer of City money broker ICAP, your fortune has fallen from \u00a3895m to \u00a3410m, it may hurt, but it doesn't change a lifestyle. Marks &amp; Spencer gourmet dishes may lose sales as more shoppers head for Lidl, but Sir Stuart will not be pawning his wine cellar. </p> <p>The public mood has changed. Expect little tolerance for showy excess from those who made fortunes out of ruining everyone else. As the government shovels money into the banks by the half trillion, suddenly it's not clear what anything is worth any more. \"Whatever it takes\" is needed to stop unimaginable economic collapse, but what is a lot now, and what is not a lot? It makes \u00a33bn cheap to halve the number of poor children by 2010. Free school meals or free childcare for all is a mere bagatelle. Freeze frame this strange time, hit by bullets yet still running, waiting for the vital economic organs to fail.</p> <p>Gordon Brown said: \"This is not a time for conventional thinking or out-dated dogma, but for fresh and innovative intervention that gets to the heart of the problem.\" He did just that, out ahead of the world in bank financing and much praised. He walks and talks like a man who has found his feet, no longer drowning but waving. When he proclaims \"The end of the age of irresponsibility\", we have to forget that when it mattered he never once uttered the words he now uses: \"The days of big bonuses are over.\" </p> <p>But will he make that a reality? When the banking bill arrives in the Commons, it will get a public drubbing unless it spells out the terms for banks to take this gigantic bundle of taxpayers' cash. Private deals between each bank and the FSA, merely ordering them to put aside more capital if they indulge in risky bonus schemes, would have been good a year ago. Right now, it's not enough. Expect parliament to be as angry as Congress was: already Clegg and Cameron are out-flanking Labour in anti-bonus rhetoric.</p> <p>Expect MPs to demand that government capital in a bank must not leak out in dividends, golden parachutes or bonuses, at least for a year. Lord Digby Jones tours the studios to warn that top talent will flee to Mumbai, Dubai and Shanghai if denied big bonuses. Wiser observers say let them go, in this new era of solid and sober banking. It is remarkable that those responsible for the worst disasters are still at their desks. If they won't jump, they need forcible defenestration. That will seem small punishment if governments have to take control of entire banking systems to get them to function again, as one economist suggested in yesterday's Financial Times. </p> <p>Brown is proving a good man in a crash. The test will come when the heart-stopping drama is over and the country faces dismal years of high unemployment with both state and citizens painfully short of spending money. The mood risks turning sour, as governments everywhere take the blame.</p> <p>The chancellor's pre-budget report in November will need to spell out new priorities. Can Brown cast aside conventional thinking sufficiently to craft a vision of a good society in bad times? He has the chance because he has earned back the ears of the electorate: they are willing to listen to him again. Labour needs to send out reassurance that good government can protect everyone from the very worst. This is a middle-Britain message too for homeowners, for middle earners at risk of losing their jobs as much as for the most vulnerable. Homes and heating will be the first tests.</p> <p>Start with fear of repossession: 45,000 mortgage defaults this year, twice as many next. Add another 25% for accelerating numbers of homes lost not through mortgage arrears but from credit card debt, as a new law hits just at the wrong time, making it easier for creditors to repossess. The government now can order the banks to adopt forbearance on repossession: people in trouble need to be allowed to switch to interest-only mortgages. Labour has already agreed to let unemployed homeowners use housing benefit to pay mortgage interest after three months out of work; before they had to wait nine months, by which time most had been repossessed. </p> <p>But the change doesn't start until April, and should begin right now, helping mortgage lenders as well as home-owners. To get the housing market going again, the government needs to stand as insurer for new mortgages. Cheap land and a near-idle construction industry needs a massive government programme to insulate old homes and build, build, build to keep people in work, hire apprentices and help the housing market. </p> <p>This winter's heating bills will cause an old-and-cold crisis. In the Lords, Dale Campbell-Savours has put down a well-supported amendment to the energy bill that could shift high heating costs from the poorer to the richer at a stroke. Companies would charge a low tariff for the first block of energy, with the price rising sharply the more energy is used: current tariffs, perversely, work the other way round. Average users would pay less, heavy users pay more, with an incentive for all to cut consumption. </p> <p>On jobs, homes, heating and prices, Brown needs to persuade the country that the state is the people's best friend in hard times. If fairness is to be his guiding light, a copy of How to Spend It in his pocket would be a salutary reminder.<br><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\"><br>polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Cat On a Rain-Sodden Roof does not have the same ring, but the Corn Exchange's take on Tennessee Williams is more damp than steamy. Director Annie Ryan transposes the action from Memphis to County Clare: when Big Daddy's family gathers around him for his 65th birthday, their flashy clothes locate their conspicuous wealth and greed close to home. </p> <p>This company's trademark performance style uses extreme characterisations to create a heightened effect - though this is not always necessary here, given the intense hothouse atmosphere evoked by Williams. Joan O'Clery's costumes win the most laughs: from eldest son Gooper's lurid, diamond-patterned golf sweater, to the Riverdance-meets-Pocahontas outfits of his children. While the minor characters - especially Big Mama and her endlessly pregnant daughter-in-law, Mae - are shrieking caricatures, the three central relationships are brilliantly portrayed.</p> <p>Simone Kirby's childless Maggie, \"the cat\", is a compelling blend of defiance and vulnerability as she tries to rekindle her husband Brick's desire. Brick's whisky-sodden avoidance of her is probed in the second act, where he and his father, Big Daddy, attempt to talk openly. As Brick complains of the \"mendacity\" that surrounds him, they circle around the truth about Brick's feelings for his dead best friend.</p> <p>Sensitively played by Rory Nolan as the self-deceiving drunk, with Andrew Bennett making his overbearing father seem sympathetic, it is a riveting scene that stays close to the original. The production is most successful here, leaving contemporary parallels to be drawn by the audience, as we look at the set design's bright blue sky and know that there is a cloud lurking somewhere.</p>",
  "<p>Wag meets me at Paddington station, and we clamber on board the Heathrow Express. \"What have you packed?\" I ask, looking at his bag. Wag's in a band called the Infadels, and he's fresh off tour, but you can tell he's relaxed, because he's wearing his holiday shirt and a fancy hat.</p> <p>\"I packed exactly what you told me to,\" he says. \"Gloves.

It's the same reason why, when the cab driver who ferried me to Paddington asked: \"Going anywhere nice?\", I could only reply: \"I really hope so.\"</p> <p>It is because I have absolutely no idea. </p> <p>I decide to come clean with Wag. I tell him what I know. That we're to meet a man named Jim at 2.45pm at Terminal Five. He'll be wearing a special T-shirt and carrying with him two tickets. Tickets for me and Wag.

Not unless elaborate muggings start with a series of secretive emails asking for your full name and then tell you to send a copy of your passport to a mysterious address.</p> <p>Actually, hang on - this bloody well could be an elaborate mugging.</p> <p>And then - to my relief - Jim arrives. He does not appear to be a mugger.</p> <p>Jim O'Brien is head of operations at Imaginative Traveller, and this - today - is the company's first attempt at something they hope will take off next year: the magical mystery tour. You pay your money, you pack your bags, you turn up, and then ... this.</p> <p>\"Be straight with us, Jim,\" says Wag. \"We're not cycling to Bromsgrove, are we?\"</p> <p>\"We're going a little further than that.\"</p> <p>\"No clues?\" I say.</p> <p>\"No clues,\" says Jim. \"Though you might want to take that sticker off your bag.\"</p> <p>We look at Wag's bag. A large white sticker says \"Infadels\". He tears it off.</p> <p>Wag and I stare at each other, wide-eyed. We say nothing, but we are both now convinced we'll be holidaying in Fallujah.</p> <p>Jim leads us into the terminal, and Wag and I exchange a glance as we secretly read the back of his Imaginative Traveller T-shirt.</p> <p>\"Argentina!\" whispers Wag. \"China!\"</p> <p>I am as excited as he is. Until I see the word \"Egypt\". Egypt is the one place I don't want to go. The one place in the world Jim could have chosen which would make my heart sink, and my shoulders sag. Apart from Bromsgrove.</p> <p>We walk through security, and then we're at the gates ...</p> <p>\"Let it be Fallujah,\" I think. \"Let it be Fallujah.\"</p> <p>And then Jim turns to face us.</p> <p>\"We're going to Egypt!\" he says.</p> <p>Wag punches the air.</p> <p>My reason for disliking Egypt, I think, as I sit on the plane, is simple. I once had a bad time there. I was in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh for one week. A week I spent being hassled by men who thought I wanted to buy their dodgy homemade perfumes, with names they'd clearly nicked out of the dictionary, like Arachnid, or Amnesia, or - a personal favourite - Booby. It was an aggressive place, soaked in testosterone, and where all anyone wants from you is a fistful of your money, in return for a small wooden pyramid and a frothing pint of Booby.</p> <p>Egypt is rubbish.</p> <p>Fast forward one day. And my opinion of Egypt has changed somewhat.</p> <p>It's amazing.</p> <p>It might be because right now, I am in a mudbrick house, a few hours outside Cairo, with a donkey, a cow and a buffalo in the very next room, and I am eating okra and tomato and homemade flatbread with a local farmer and his family.</p> <p>It might be because this morning, Wag and I were surprised with the news that the Jeeps would be arriving shortly, and as we computed the word \"Jeeps\" we realised we'd be driving far into the desert ... 150km out of Cairo, to Wadi Al-Hitan, the Valley of the Whales. There we wandered, me, Wag, Jim and our tour guide Emad, into the vast nothingness of the Western Desert, the only people on Earth doing what we were doing, until we stumbled upon the bones of a 45-million-year-old whale. A whale so old it was a whale with legs.</p> <p>\"It's a basilosaurus,\" said Emad, proudly, even though that definitely sounds like a made-up name. \"They were found here in 1830. First, people thought they were some kind of huge reptile. It was only later they realised it was a kind of whale ... one which lived on land and in water.\"</p> <p>\"Yesterday we were in Terminal 5,\" said Wag, with excitement in his eyes. \"Today we're in the desert. In Egypt. And we've just seen a 45-million-year old-whale. With legs!\"</p> <p>It's an incredible landscape - all wind-battered rocks and vast yellow dunes - and as yet largely unknown on the tourist trail. It might as well be another planet; silent apart from the breeze, the mountains in the distance. Forget the pyramids. This is ancient Egypt.</p> <p>It feels special.</p> <p>And now - right now - this feels special, too. Like we've found something of the real Egypt. We sit quietly and eat, as the men of the family share their grilled chicken with us, and the cats (there must be a thousand cats in this small room alone, all of whom are simply called \"Cat\", which must surely give them identity issues) try their hardest to get close. Afterwards, the children wash our hands, and the elders spark up their fags in the background. A chicken jumps from an attic room, and everyone laughs. </p> <p>\"We try and do something like this on every tour we do,\" says Jim, flinching as a cat bounds by with a chicken leg it's nicked. \"I think you get to know a country best through its people ...\"</p> <p>Everything we've done so far has been revealed at the last possible moment. Jim and Emad have taken great pleasure in keeping their secrets, even though they're sometimes a little bit rubbish at it.</p> <p>\"When we go to a bazaar,\" Emad will say, before his eyes widen and he clicks his fingers. \"What I mean is, if we go to one ...\" </p> <p>And we'll laugh, and we'll take the mickey, but we're excited, because we don't want to know what happens next. We don't want an itinerary to study, or to know what we'll be seeing or where we'll be eating or who we'll be meeting. We're discovering a country as we see it, and it's fun.</p> <p>We say goodbye to our generous hosts, and make our way past donkeys and cows to our jeeps. There, waiting for us, is a truck full of policemen.</p> <p>In 1997, 60 tourists visiting a temple in southern Egypt were shot dead by Islamic militants. Since then, the government has been taking no chances. The police knew that Wag and I would be arriving, and since we had breakfast this morning, they've been tailing us everywhere we go. It is quite exciting, tainted only by the fact that they all look so bored and listless. At one point, someone in charge asks Emad for some money to make their wait more worthwhile. Emad refuses, and they just shrug, and continue to silently follow us. </p> <p>\"Maybe they think we're royalty,\" says Wag.</p> <p>I look at one of them. He's yawning.</p> <p>\"I'm not sure they do,\" I say.</p> <p>The next day and we're in Fayoum, bouncing down sand dunes in the 4x4. The police gave up their chase when we went off-road, and we stop in the desert.</p> <p>\"If you were staying longer,\" says Emad, \"we would camp out here one night. Meet up with a Bedouin tribe. Ride camels. Play music. And stare at the stars.\"</p> <p>It sounds amazing. Especially, I realise, with not a little shame, the camels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338480176\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/10/DANNYEMBED1.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Wallace in Egypt\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny and Wag in Egypt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim O'Brien/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"You like camels?\" asks Emad. \"We can get you camels!\"</p> <p>I shake my head and blush as I realise a trip like this has no room for cliche. This is about getting away from all that. Trying new things.</p> <p>\"He likes camels quite a lot,\" says Wag, quietly.</p> <p>\"No, I don't,\" I say, to reassure Emad.</p> <p>There is a pause.</p> <p>\"Yes he does,\" says Wag.</p> <p>Three hours later and Wag and I are on camels.</p> <p>Our legs hurt and we cut awkward, gangly, bouncing figures, but it doesn't matter, because it's sunset, and we're alone on a sand dune right opposite the Great Pyramids. We try and count the cliches. If a mummy smoking a shisha shaped like a sphinx happened by on a donkey, I think we'd have the lot. But it's great. An instantly recognisable memory I can share with a million strangers around the globe.</p> <p>\"What do you reckon happens now?\" whispers Wag. \"We've done deserts. Camels. Pyramids. Villages. Fossils. Old men who live with buffalos. What's next?\"</p> <p>I shrug. And then I look at Emad. And I remember something he said.</p> <p>\"Bazaars!\" he says, delighted he can finally come out with it.</p> <p>\"Hey, my friend, where are you from?\" shouts the man to my left.</p> <p>\"My friend! Hello! My shop!\" says the man next to him.</p> <p>This is awful. This is a nightmare. This is like being back in Sharm el-Sheikh. This is the Egypt I remember.</p> <p>We're in the middle of a Cairo market. The noise is intense. The pollution from the road that runs alongside overpowering. Men on scooters mount the pavement and drive through the crowd, weaving in and out and accelerating all the time. A fat man lets off firecrackers outside a bedding shop. People jostle for space, the world is just ankles and elbows, and everywhere - everywhere - there are men demanding your money in return for a series of terrible goods.</p> <p>Wag is as disoriented as I am. We find a restaurant and tell Emad and Jim to order whatever they think we should have. And as our tamarind juice arrives, and as our baba ganoush and rice is prepared, I realise that the bustling Cairo outside shouldn't taint my view of Egypt. Because it's the opposite of the Egypt I've seen these past few days. </p> <p>And it's an Egypt I never would have seen, if someone else hadn't been arranging for me to see it. Sure, I might've ended up on a camel near a pyramid. But the cliche wouldn't have been rewarding without the surprises. Like the waterfall in the middle of nowhere that Emad showed us. The ancient village with its sleepy, gun-toting security guards. The old man who insisted we ride in his boat. The kids who'd run alongside our jeep and wave. The people who'd shout \"Welcome to Egypt!\" and then jog away, giggling.</p> <p>\"So where else?\" I ask Jim, as we finish our food, on this, our last night. \"Where else will your surprise tours go?\"</p> <p>He leans forward, conspiratorially. \"If I tell you, you can't print it,\" he says.</p> <p>I nod.

  "<p><strong>I have read on more than one occasion that men are likely to choose partners who remind them of their mothers, What if I in no way resemble his mother? Will the relationship last?</strong></p> <p>Are you sure you don't resemble your partner's mother? It's Oedipal to think of him wanting to go out with his mother, but cherishing a minor resemblance is rather sweet. Researchers claim that both men and women are susceptible to sexual imprinting, defined as the sexual preference we have for individuals who look like our (opposite sex) parent. The hypothesis is that by looking into someone's face as an infant you get a template by which to judge your future mate. But it's sex specific. Men don't want a lover who looks like their dad. The adage that men should look at their mothers-in-law to see how their wives will age is out of date. Men should look at their own mums. Research in 2002 by Tamas Bereczkei, a Hungarian psychologist who compared more than 300 pictures of faces of family members with those of strangers found that the 'judges' in the study correctly matched wives to mothers-in-law more often than by chance (significantly so). </p> <p>In a more recent study by Bereczkei, published in the Proceedings Of The Royal Society B, he identified the facial characteristics that people most look for in partners (when they're looking for a mother or father substitute). His team measured the facial proportions of 312 people from 52 Hungarian families. The matches between family members (which included a young man or woman, their long-term partner and both sets of parents) were compared with those of randomly selected couples by independent judges. They found that young women resembled their partner's mothers in terms of how full their lips were, the width of their mouths and the size of their jaws. Women went for men who had their dad's nose and a similar jaw length to face length ratio. This has to be unconscious unless your partner's taken a tape measure to your face. </p> <p>But men also want women to be as smart as their mothers. A study by sociologist Christine Whelan at the University of Iowa surveyed 800 men who earned salaries in the top 10% of their age group (they were in their 20s and 30s) and found that nearly 80% of those whose mothers had bachelor degrees had wives who were educated to a similar level. </p> <p>There are many reasons why relationships last; how well you deal with conflict, how you share the housework and what your sex life is like. I've yet to see a list that says how much you resemble his mother is one of them.</p> <p>Email your problems to <a href=\"mailto:love@theguardian.com\">love@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>Europe</h2> <p>EU governments yesterday rushed to adopt UK-style financial rescue plans, with Germany close to adopting a scheme for \u20ac150bn (\u00a3119bn) in guarantees and capital injection for its banks.</p> <p>The Spanish cabinet approved a \u20ac30bn fund, which can be raised to \u20ac50bn, to buy \"quality\" assets from banks, and it increased the deposit guarantee to \u20ac100,000. Ministers said the scheme would cost taxpayers nothing. Italy, which approved emergency legislation to recapitalise banks and inject equity on Thursday, said it would ban short selling in all stocks, not just banks and insurers, on the day after the US lifted its ban.</p> <p>Danish MPs approved a government scheme to back up all bank deposits and guarantees; and Dutch finance groups welcomed a government plan for a \u20ac20bn capital fund. France this week set up a \"state participation society\", containing - so far - \u20ac1bn capital in municipal lender Dexia; but it made no further moves yesterday, saying its banks were \"robust\".</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Given Britain's grim relations with Russia, it was unlikely that Moscow would ever praise Gordon Brown. But the Kremlin is considering a Brown-style plan to ease Russia's dire banking problems. The government will set up a fund to buy \"quality\" assets from banks struggling with liquidity,with the country's central bank putting in $15bn initially.</p> <p>Russia's two leaders, meanwhile, have wasted little time in blaming the crisis on the US. President Dmitry Medvedev this week memorably accused the US administration of \"economic egoism\". Vladimir Putin, the prime minister, said: \"Confidence in the US as the leader of the free world and the free market... has been undermined - for good, I think.\"</p> <p>Russia has been keen to downplay its own economic difficulties. Although regulators suspended trading again on Russia's two main stock markets yesterday, TV news channels have been told not to use the words \"collapse\" or \"crisis\"; and there has been little mention of the flight of foreign investors from Russia.</p> <h2>India</h2> <p>The global slump hit the Indian economy hard yesterday, with the authorities slashing banks' reserve requirement after the rupee slumped to a record low and overnight lending rates doubled. The stock market dropped 800 points, to 10,527 - less than half its level in January.</p> <p>The Reserve Bank of India dropped the cash reserve ratio to 7.5% from 9%, its steepest cut since 2001, sending 600bn rupees (\u00a37.1bn) into the financial system. India's central bankers had become alarmed after overnight rates soared to as much as 23% in the money market and tighter liquidity saw the government call off a $2bn (\u00a31.16bn) bond auction.</p> <p>Annual industrial output growth was 1.3% in August, its lowest in nearly 10 years and far below a revised 7.4% expansion in July. Palaniappan Chidambaram, the finance minister, insisted the figures were \"not satisfactory... and not reliable\".</p> <h2>Japan</h2> <p>Lessons learned from Japan's so-called lost decade of recession in the 90s have been credited with sparing it from the worst of the crisis. But this week proved the country had no reason to be complacent. </p> <p>The Nikkei yesterday ended the worst week in its history with a fall of almost 10%, the biggest one-day loss since the crash of 1987. Yamato, a life insurance firm with a 98-year history, has gone under with debts of \u00a5269bn (\u00a31.55bn) - the industry's first bankruptcy for seven years.</p> <p>Despite official insistence that its economic fundamentals remain sound, all the major indicators show that the world's second-biggest economy is teetering on the brink of recession again. </p> <h2>Brazil</h2> <p>Brazil's main stock market index fell more than 10% in early trading yesterday, compounding weeks of heavy losses in which two years of gains in Latin America's biggest economy were wiped out. The Ibovespa index fell 10.2% to 33,303 in just the first half-hour after markets opened yesterday. Trading was then halted for 30 minutes by a \"circuit breaker\" that takes effect when the index loses 10%. Brazil's currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the dollar. </p> <h2>Venezuela</h2> <p>Venezuela is bracing for the petro-state to curb its free-spending ways after President Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year's budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel.</p> <p>Chavez says he hopes the crisis will prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan for a Bank of the South, to counter the influence of the World Bank.</p> <h2>Cuba</h2> <p>Cuba's isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. \"It was expected,\" Fidel Castro noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma. He did not elaborate. Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated its agriculture and infrastructure. </p> <h2>Zimbabwe</h2> <p>There are economic crises - and then there is Zimbabwe's financial system. While much of the rest of the world is anxious about plunging markets, bank collapses and recession, Zimbabweans would settle for any of that just to be able to find cash and to have it worth something in the face of an official inflation rate of 231m%. Independent economists say the real inflation rate is in the trillions, but such numbers have ceased to mean anything to most Zimbabweans, who are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of a few pence a day from their bank accounts.</p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>The Baghdad bourse is booming, with the general index of Iraq's stock exchange up by nearly 40% last month. The floor was heaving with investors and brokers on Thursday, many glued to their phones and eager to snap up bargains on the second day of trading after a national holiday. Hotels and banks were the hottest picks among the exchange's 95 listed companies. </p> <p>But Iraq's 2009 budget depends on oil staying above $80 a barrel. Prices - above $140 in July - have fallen below $90 in recent months. </p> <h2>Middle East</h2> <p>Developers and banks were among the hardest-hit by falls in Gulf Arab markets, with governments hoping that huge budget surpluses and non-oil sector growth would sustain them through the crisis. Dubai's market was down by more than 20% in four days of trading, while the Arab world's largest, Saudi Arabia, fell by more than 17%. Among the hardest-hit in Dubai were developers and banks.</p> <p>However, only in a region where developers are announcing $100bn construction projects even as markets collapse could the crisis be seen as a potential blessing. Some analysts say the current meltdown could bring a much-needed cooling of the overheated economies in the region. Meanwhile, Opec members are zealously looking to guard prices, and recently announced a meeting for November - a month ahead of schedule.</p> <h2>Southeast Asia</h2> <p>Stock markets have plunged to their lowest levels in years, where they are open - the authorities in Jakarta kept Indonesia's stock market closed for a third day in a row. Suspected intervention by the central bank failed to prop up the rupiah, which briefly touched 10,000 to the dollar, its weakest since December 2005.</p> <p>Thai stocks fell by more than 10% to trigger a temporary trading halt, before closing down 9.6%. Bank stocks were particularly hard-hit. In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 7.3% to its lowest close since December 2004. Malaysian stocks were down 3.6%, and Vietnamese, 4.7%.</p> <p>\"Everybody under the sun is selling,\" said Gabriel Gan, head of sales trading at AmFraser Securities in Singapore. \"There has been a total loss of confidence. We are seeing panic selling.\"</p>",
  "<p>We recently moved to Italy for my husband's work. It is lovely, but there is one fairly big problem. There doesn't seem to be the preoccupation with dental hygiene that there is in Britain. My husband (he is Italian) and his family, and my children's teachers, all seem to think I am being a fusspot. A common refrain is \"What's the worry? Her milk teeth will fall out and she will get new ones.\" As Nutella is a staple tea-time treat here when my children are with my mother-in-law, and no one around them seems to brush their teeth, it's an uphill battle for me. Are there any products I could buy that can emphasise the message that looking after your teeth is a good idea? (I think you are Italian and I hope I haven't offended you!) My children are three and five.<br><strong>Alex Vetri,</strong> Bari</p> <p>You haven't offended me in the slightest - au contraire, I recognise exactly what you are saying. I'm sure there are lots and lots of Italians who have excellent dental hygiene (don't write in) and who care very much about it, but I've never met them. My family in Italy are exactly the same with me about my five-year-old. And they think it's funny to offer her sugary snacks behind my back; and they got her hooked on Nutella; and they have fizzy, sugary drinks at every meal. </p> <p>A few practical tips first. Involve your children in choosing a toothbrush, even if you have to get them something from Disney or involving characters you may find stereotypical (Italian supermarkets have a good selection, ironically). Make sure they like the taste of the toothpaste you're offering; this is crucial but often overlooked. Children often do not like the taste of mint. After much searching, I found one that my little girl liked: Organic Children's Mandarin Toothpaste, \u00a33.25 from <a href=\"http://www.greenpeople.co.uk\">greenpeople.co.uk</a> (it delivers to Italy), and you may want to try it too. If you want them to use a fluoride toothpaste, you may need to experiment with what you can find there. Some will be more popular than others; there are some with glittery stars suspended in the toothpaste, which sounds tricksy but you're looking for anything that will encourage toothbrushing. Letterbox (<a href=\"http://www.letterbox.co.uk\">letterbox.co.uk</a>) has a nice little brush holder with a timer, but it may be ambitious to expect them to brush for longer than 30 seconds. </p> <p>A few books that may help, recommended by the children and young people's librarian at Selsdon library in south London: \"Open Wide by Tom Barber is about a small boy who goes, rather fearfully, to the dentist, and is told all about the animals the dentist has treated and the problems they caused. Harry and the Dinosaurs Say \"Raahh!\" by Ian Whybrow, a lovely picture book story about a small boy taking his plastic dinosaurs to the dentist to give himself enough courage to get into the chair. Freddie Visits the Dentist by Nicola Smee; a simple picture book about a small boy's first visit to the dentist with his bear. Open Wide! My First Trip to the Dentist by Jen Green, another simple picture book.\"</p> <p>But in the end, what you may find most helpful is, bizarrely, the family themselves. What are their teeth like? My aunt has false teeth and one day she had them out, showing her stubby black teeth underneath. My daughter was truly horrified and asked what had happened to them. I replied, simply and truthfully, that \"she never looked after her teeth\"; ever since that day, my little girl has brushed her teeth without fail (ideally you should brush their teeth for them until they are about seven). </p> <p>Janet Clarke, a spokesperson for the British Dental Association, also has some advice for you: don't get disheartened or force your children to brush. Just let them watch you brush your teeth and make it part of everyday life. </p> <p>Also, make sure that if they do eat sweets (as this is real life, we're talking about), they eat them at meal times or at one sitting. Each sweet increases the acid levels in the mouth for about 20 minutes; so best to get them out of the way in one go. Also at meal times the levels of saliva are increased anyway and this helps to dilute the acid. </p> <p>So if your in-laws want to give sweet things, ask if they at least can do it at a set time in the day. Italians hold great store by giving treats to children and you will often see a bowl of sweets on the table, so I understand what you are up against. I say no to boiled sweets for my child (say they are a choking risk, this they will understand more than a risk to dental health). </p> <p>Chocolate is better than chewy or sucky sweets, although chocolate spread is not great as it's \"sticky\" and increases the acid levels for longer. If all else fails, get your child to drink a glass of water after eating sweets (to help dilute the acid). Fizzy drinks - even fizzy water - are not great as it strips the enamel off teeth, so if you can't get them to give it up, dilute it with still water. </p> <p>If all else fails, tell your family that you're both giving up sugar for religious reasons - this they will understand.</p>",

  "<h2>Overpaid ... but still branded as 'in arrears'</h2> <p>My mother and I live on benefits, with the Department of Work and Pensions paying towards our Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgage - I pay our \u00a3146 a month in person at the local office. In 2006, we withdrew \u00a36,000 from our savings to reduce the loan. And in February this year, we decided to do the same - taking \u00a35,000 this time. We then resumed normal payments.</p> <p>As we had overpaid and thought we were ahead, we were utterly shocked to receive a letter last month from B&amp;B saying we were in arrears by \u00a3349, that it would charge us \u00a325 a month, demanding details of our income and spending and warning we might have to pay \u00a3136 (plus VAT) for \"an agent's visit\" which would be added to our home loan. Please help.<br><strong>SB, London</strong></p> <p>Since you wrote to Capital Letters, B&amp;B's mortgage arm has been nationalised. But what happened was pure private enterprise inefficiency, as all your problems pre-dated the state bailout. A second letter even came up with a different arrears amount for the same period.</p> <p>Following the 2006 overpayment, you thought all you had to do was to repeat the process with a cheque which you paid in when the account was a few pounds in credit. What went wrong was, B&amp;B says, that you failed to specify the \u00a35,000 payment also included the normal \u00a3146 payable in February. Of course, your B&amp;B branch, now no longer handling loans following de-privatisation, should have asked you. It did not, so all the \u00a35,000 went to the capital account to cut the loan, leaving B&amp;B to chase you for the regular \u00a3146. </p> <p>You went into arrears even though you were well ahead of your schedule. </p> <p>B&amp;B will now amend your records to show you are in credit, ensure your credit rating is unaffected, withdraw interest and charges, and prevent any agent visits. And it will send you a big box of chocolates to say sorry.</p> <h2>Delivering a message to Martin about pay</h2> <p>My 17-year-old schoolgirl daughter has worked for Martin The Newsagents delivering papers, including The Guardian, for four years. Earlier this year, she gave advance notice of two separate weeks holiday in August.</p> <p>She asked her manager about holiday pay but he was noncommittal.</p> <p>After her first week away, she was told holiday pay was at the discretion of the area manager. She read her contract and wrote to Martin's head office asking them to remind its managers of their legal obligations. She was not paid for the second week, either. </p> <p>Since then, she has been ignored by Martin's management.</p> <p>She is paid \u00a315 a week which is big money to a teenager. Please help.</p> <p><strong>PG, Hertfordshire </strong></p> <p>Newspapers depend on your daughter and colleagues for a big slice of circulation. And few want to do the job - your daughter has four years experience, so she should be valued.</p> <p>She has a very clear \"statement of terms and conditions of employment\" which offers four weeks paid holiday a year for those over school leaving age - which she is. This is not employer largesse but compliance with the law.</p> <p>Why she was told the payment was discretionary is unclear. Employers can, of course, have some control over when staff go on holiday - but this hurdle had already been crossed as she had permission to take the time off.</p> <p>Capital Letters went to TM Retail, the owners of Martin, and pointed out its obligations to a top manager. Your daughter now has her two weeks wages - \u00a330 - and has promised to deliver Guardians with special care. </p> <h2>Crossed wires about Asda's bargain sim</h2> <p>As a struggling pensioner I was delighted to read in Guardian Money that Asda had started offering pay-as-you-go sim cards with calls costing 8p per minute - around half the Tesco level.</p> <p>However, when I went to my local store, the assistant told me that, contrary to what you had written, the sim cards were only available if I bought a new phone, which I didn't want to do. Who is misleading whom here?</p> <p><strong>OD, Hereford.</strong></p> <p>It seems that the store staff told you a load of old guff, perhaps they wanted to sell more phones that week.</p> <p>But, as we reported, its 50p sim cards are available as a standalone purchase. Asda has now sent a message to this effect to all stores to re-educate staff on this point. When you next visit the store, you will be given a new sim card free of charge plus a \u00a315 Asda voucher to say sorry.</p> <h2>Please note, you can cash in your old francs</h2> <p>I have just found a thousand French Francs in a bag I haven't used for ages. I know these cannot be spent in France any more so what, if anything, can I do with them?</p> <p><strong>LL, Liverpool </strong></p> <p>Your only course is to take them to a branch of Banque de France the next time you cross the Channel. This bank will exchange franc notes (but not coins) until at least February 2012.</p> <p>You will receive one euro for each 6.55957 francs so your 1000FF would be worth \u20ac152.44 - about \u00a3120 at the moment compared with the less than \u00a3100 you would have had in 2002 when the euro was introduced - you are at least gaining from sterling weakness.</p> <p>The Banque has branches in most major French cities - the <a href=\"http://www.banque-france.fr\">banque-france.fr</a> website has a listing - but check opening times before you go. </p> <h2>Casting light on this mystery accident</h2> <p>Transport for London contractor Ringway Jacobs, has written to me telling me I was involved in an accident in Vauxhall last year which caused \"significant damage and disruption to the road network\".</p> <p>Apparently, after this \"damage and disruption\" Ringway Jacobs was contracted by TfL to carry out emergency and permanent repairs. </p> <p>Interestingly, I was shunted by a van on the same day but about half a mile away. The other driver's insurance company paid for damage to my vehicle.</p> <p>For the record there was no damage or disruption and I picked up the few bits of plastic tail-light that were on the road.</p> <p>As it asks for personal details including my insurance contract, is this a new form of Nigerian scam?</p> <p><strong>SL, London</strong></p> <p>No, although the language is somewhat overblown. </p> <p>The cost would appear to be for cleaning up the road after the accident which might have left debris harmful to cyclists and walkers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, your letter spoke of a road which was a junction or two away from where the crash happened. </p> <p>This was a mistake - it seems the accident report just put down the nearest significant junction rather than the actual location. </p> <p>The contractor's letter asks for your insurer's details so that the costs can be recovered from the insurer under the third party cover.</p> <p>In this case, you had already agreed with the owners of the van that hit you that the accident was the van driver's fault and not yours. All your car repair costs were paid by the other party. </p> <p>So your insurer will send the bill to the van driver's insurance company, leaving your no claims discount intact.</p>",
  "<p>Alice Munro is among the major writers of English fiction of our time. She's been accorded armfuls of super-superlatives by critics in both North America and Britain, she's won many awards, and she has a devoted international readership. Among writers, her name is spoken in hushed tones. She's the kind of writer about whom it is often said - no matter how well known she becomes - that she ought to be better known. </p> <p>None of this happened overnight. Munro has been writing since the 1960s, and her first collection, <em>Dance of the Happy Shades</em>, appeared in 1968. To date - and including her latest, the rapturously received <em>Runaway</em> (2004) - she has published 10 collections, averaging nine or 10 stories each. Though her fiction has been a regular feature of the New Yorker since the 1970s, her recent elevation to international literary sainthood took as long as it did partly because of the form in which she writes. She is a writer of stories - \"short stories\", as they used to be called, or \"short fiction\", which is now more common. Though many American and British and Canadian writers of the first rank have practised this form, there is still a widespread but false tendency to equate length with importance. </p> <p>Thus Munro has been among those writers subject to periodic rediscovery, at least outside Canada. It's as if she jumps out of a cake - <em>Surprise!</em> - and then has to jump out of it again, and then again. Readers don't see her name in lights on every billboard. They come across her as if by accident or fate, and are drawn in, and then there is an outbreak of wonder and excitement, and incredulity - <em>Where did Alice Munro come from? Why didn't anybody tell me? How can such excellence have sprung from nowhere?</em></p> <p>But Munro did not spring from nowhere. She sprang - though it's a verb her characters would find overly sprightly, and indeed pretentious - from Huron County, in south-western Ontario. Ontario is the large province of Canada that stretches from the Ottawa River to the western end of Lake Superior. This is a huge and varied space, but south-western Ontario is a distinct part of it. It was named Sowesto by the painter Greg Curnoe, a name that has stuck. Curnoe's view was that Sowesto was an area of considerable interest, but also of considerable psychic murkiness and oddity, a view shared by many. Robertson Davies, also from Sowesto, used to say \"I know the dark folk-ways of my people\", and Munro knows them, too. You are likely to run into quite a few signs in Sowesto wheat fields telling you to be prepared to meet your God, or else your doom - felt to be much the same thing. </p> <p>Lake Huron lies at the western edge of Sowesto, Lake Erie to the south. The country is mostly flat farmland, cut by several wide, winding rivers prone to flooding, and along the rivers - because of the available boat transport and the power provided by water-driven mills - a number of smaller and larger towns grew up in the 19th century. Each has its red-brick town hall (usually with a tower), its post-office building and handful of churches of various denominations, its main street and residential section of gracious homes, and its other residential section on the wrong side of the tracks. Each has its families with long memories and stashes of bones in the closets. </p> <p>Sowesto contains the site of the Donnelly massacre of the 19th century, when a large family were slaughtered and their home burnt as a result of political resentments carried over from Ireland. Lush nature, repressed emotions, respectable fronts, hidden sexual excesses, outbreaks of violence, lurid crimes, long-held grudges, strange rumours - these are never far away in Munro's Sowesto, partly because all have been provided by the real life of the region. </p> <p>When Munro was growing up in the 1930s and 40s, the idea of a person from Canada - but especially one from small-town south-western Ontario - thinking she could be a writer to be taken seriously in the world at large was laughable. Even by the 50s and 60s there were very few publishers in Canada, and these were mostly textbook publishers that imported whatever so-called literature was to be had from Britain and the United States. There might have been some amateur theatre - high-school performances, Little Theatre groups. There was, however, the radio, and in the 60s Munro got her start through a CBC programme called <em>Anthology</em>, produced by Robert Weaver. </p> <p>But very few Canadian writers of any sort were known to an international readership, and it was taken for granted that if you had hankerings of that kind - hankerings about which you would feel defensive and ashamed, because art was not something a grown-up, morally credible person would fool around with - it would be best for you if you left the country. Everyone knew that writing was not a thing from which you could ever expect to make a living. </p> <p>It might be marginally acceptable to dabble around the edges of water-colour painting or poetry if you were a certain kind of man, described by Munro in \"The Turkey Season\": \"There were homosexuals in town, and we knew who they were: an elegant, light-voiced, wavy-haired paperhanger who called himself an interior decorator; the minister's widow's fat, spoiled only son, who went so far as to enter baking contests and had crocheted a tablecloth; a hypochondriacal church organist and music teacher who kept the choir and his pupils in line with screaming tantrums.\" Or you could do art as a hobby, if you were a woman with time on your hands, or you could scrape out a living at some poorly paid quasi-artistic job. Munro's stories are sprinkled with women like this. They go in for piano playing or write chatty newspaper columns. Or - more tragically - they have a real though small talent, like Almeda Roth in \"Meneseteung\", who produces one volume of minor verse called <em>Offerings</em>, but there is no context for them. </p> <p>If you moved to a larger Canadian city, you might at least find a few others of your ilk, but in the small towns of Sowesto you'd be on your own. Nevertheless, John Kenneth Galbraith, Robertson Davies, Marian Engel, Graeme Gibson and James Reaney all came out of Sowesto; and Munro - after a spell on the west coast - moved back there, and lives at present not far from Wingham, the prototype of the various Jubilees and Walleys and Dalgleishes and Hanrattys in her stories. </p> <p>Through Munro's fiction, Sowesto's Huron County has joined Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County as a slice of land made legendary by the excellence of the writer who has celebrated it, though in both cases \"celebrated\" is not quite the right word. \"Anatomised\" might be closer to what goes on in the work of Munro, though even that term is too clinical. What should we call the combination of obsessive scrutiny, archaeological unearthing, precise and detailed recollection, the wallowing in the seamier and meaner and more vengeful undersides of human nature, the telling of erotic secrets, the nostalgia for vanished miseries, and rejoicing in the fullness and variety of life, stirred all together? </p> <p>At the end of Munro's <em>Lives of Girls and Women</em> (1971), her only novel and a bildungsroman - a portrait of the artist as a young girl - there's a telling passage. Del Jordan of Jubilee, who has by now (true to her surname) crossed over into the promised land of womanhood and also of writerhood, says of her adolescence: </p> <p>'It did not occur to me then that one day I would be so greedy for Jubilee. Voracious and misguided as Uncle Craig out at Jenkin's Bend, writing his history, I would want to write things down. </p> <p>'I would try to make lists. A list of all the stores and businesses going up and down the main street and who owned them, a list of family names, names on the tombstones in the cemetery and any inscriptions underneath ...</p> <p>'The hope of accuracy we bring to such tasks is crazy, heartbreaking. </p> <p>'And no list could hold what I wanted, for what I wanted was every last thing, every layer of speech and thought, stroke of light on bark or walls, every smell, pothole, pain, crack, delusion, held still and held together - radiant, everlasting.'</p> <p>As a programme for a life's work, this is daunting. But it's a programme Munro was to follow over the next 35 years with remarkable fidelity.</p> <p>Alice Munro was born Alice Laidlaw in 1931, which means that she was a small child during the depression. She was eight in 1939, the year Canada entered the second world war, and she attended university - the University of Western Ontario - in the postwar years. She was 25 and a young mother when Elvis Presley first became famous, and 38 at the time of the flower-child revolution and the advent of the women's movement in 1968-69, when her first book was published. In 1981 she was 50. Her stories are set mainly over these years - the 30s to the 80s - or even before then, in the time of ancestral memory. </p> <p>Her own ancestry was partly Scottish Presbyterian: she can trace her family back to James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, friend of Robert Burns and the Edinburgh literati of the late 18th century, and author of <em>Confessions of a Justified Sinner</em>, which could itself be a Munro title. On the other side of the family there were Anglicans, for whom the worst sin is said to consist of using the wrong fork at dinner. Munro's acute consciousness of social class, and of the minutiae and sneers separating one level from the next, is honestly come by, as is - from the Presbyterians - her characters' habit of rigorously examining their own deeds, emotions, motives and consciences, and finding them wanting. In a traditional Protestant culture, such as that of small-town Sowesto, forgiveness is not easily come by, punishments are frequent and harsh, potential humiliation and shame lurk around every corner, and nobody gets away with much. </p> <p>But this tradition also contains the doctrine of justification by faith alone: grace descends upon us without any action on our part. In Munro's work, grace abounds, but it is strangely disguised: nothing can be predicted. Emotions erupt. Preconceptions crumble. Surprises proliferate. Astonishments leap out. Malicious acts can have positive consequences. Salvation arrives when least expected, and in peculiar forms. </p> <p>But as soon as you make such a pronouncement about Munro's writing, or any other such analysis, inference or generalisation about it, you're aware of that mocking commentator so often present in a Munro story - the one who says, in essence: <em>Who do you think you are? What gives you the right to think you know anything about me, or about anyone else for that matter?</em> Or, to quote from <em>Lives of Girls and Women</em> again: \"People's lives ... were dull, simple, amazing and unfathomable - deep caves paved with kitchen linoleum.\" The key word here is \"unfathomable\". </p> <p>Munro's fictional world is peopled with secondary characters who despise art and artifice, and any kind of pretentiousness or showing off. It's against these attitudes and the self-mistrust they inspire that her central characters must struggle in order to free themselves enough to create anything at all. </p> <p>At the same time, her writer protagonists share this scorn of the artificial side of art, and the distrust of it. What should be written about? How should one write? How much of art is genuine, how much just a bag of cheap tricks - imitating people, manipulating their emotions, making faces? How can one affirm anything about another person - even a made-up person - without presumption? Above all, how should a story end? (Munro often provides one ending, then questions or revises it. Or else she simply distrusts it, as in the final paragraph of \"Meneseteung\" where the narrator says: \"I may have got it wrong.\") Isn't the very act of writing an act of arrogance, isn't the pen a broken reed? A number of stories - \"Friend of My Youth\", \"Carried Away\", \"Wilderness Station\", \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\" - contain letters that display the vanity or falsity or even the malice of their writers. If the writing of letters can be so devious, what about writing itself? </p> <p>This tension has remained with her: as in \"The Moons of Jupiter\", Munro's artistic characters are punished for not succeeding, but they are punished also for success. The woman writer, thinking about her father, says: \"I could hear him saying, Well, I didn't see anything about you in Maclean's. And if he had read something about me, he would say, Well, I didn't think too much of that write-up. His tone would be humorous and indulgent but would produce in me a familiar dreariness of spirit. The message I got from him was simple: fame must be striven for, then apologised for. Getting or not getting it, you will be to blame.\"</p> <p>\"Dreariness of spirit\" is one of the great Munro enemies. Her characters do battle with it in every way they can, fighting against stifling mores and other people's deadening expectations and imposed rules of behaviour, and every possible kind of muffling and spiritual smothering. Given a choice between being a person who does good works but has inauthentic feelings and is numb at heart and being one who behaves badly but is true to what she really feels and is thus alive to herself, a Munro woman is likely to choose the latter; or, if she chooses the former, she will then comment on her own slipperiness, guile, wiliness, slyness and perversity. Honesty, in Munro's work, is not the best policy: it is not a policy at all, but an essential element, like air. The characters must get hold of at least some of it, by fair means or foul, or - they feel - they will go under. </p> <p>The battle for authenticity is waged most significantly in the field of sex. The Munro social world - like most societies in which silence and secrecy are the norm in sexual matters - carries a high erotic charge, and this charge extends like a neon penumbra around each character, illuminating landscapes, rooms and objects. A rumpled bed says more, in the hands of Munro, than any graphic in-out, in-out depiction of genitalia ever could. Munro's characters are as alert as dogs in a perfume store to the sexual chemistry in a gathering - the chemistry among others, as well as that of their own visceral responses. Falling in love, falling in lust, sneaking around on spouses and enjoying it, telling sexual lies, doing shameful things they feel compelled to do out of irresistible desire, making sexual calculations based on social desperation - few writers have explored such processes more thoroughly, and more ruthlessly. Pushing the sexual boundaries is distinctly thrilling for many a Munro woman; but in order to trespass you have to know exactly where the fence is, and Munro's universe is crisscrossed with meticulously defined borders. Hands, chairs, glances - all are part of an intricate inner map strewn with barbed wire and booby traps, and secret paths through the shrubbery. </p> <p>For women of Munro's generation, sexual expression was a liberation and a way out. But out of what? Out of the denial and limiting scorn she describes so well in \"The Turkey Season\": </p> <p>'Lily said she never let her husband come near her if he had been drinking. Marjorie said since the time she nearly died with a haemorrhage she never let her husband come near her, period. Lily said quickly that it was only when he'd been drinking that he tried anything. I could see that it was a matter of pride not to let your husband come near you, but I couldn't quite believe that \"come near\" meant \"have sex\".'</p> <p>For older women like Lily and Marjorie, to enjoy sex would have been a humiliating defeat. For women like Rose in \"The Beggar Maid\", it's a matter for pride and celebration, a victory. For later generations of women - post-sexual revolution - enjoying sex was to become simply a duty, the perfect orgasm yet another thing to add to the list of required accomplishments; and when enjoyment becomes a duty, we're back in the land of \"dreariness of spirit\". But for a Munro character in the throes of sexual exploration, the spirit may be confused and ashamed and tormented, even cruel and sadistic - some of the couples in her stories get pleasure out of torturing each other emotionally, just like some real people - but it is never dreary. </p> <p>In some of the later stories, sex can be less impetuous, more calculated. For example, Grant in \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\" uses it as the decisive element in an astonishing feat of emotional commodities trading. His beloved wife Fiona has dementia and has become attached to a similarly afflicted man in her care facility. When this man is taken home by his hard-bitten, practical wife, Marian, Fiona pines and stops eating. Grant wants to persuade Marian to put her husband back in the institution, but Marian refuses: it would cost too much. However, Grant detects that Marian is lonely and sexually available. She has a wrinkled-up face, but her body is still attractive. Like an adroit salesman, Grant moves in to close the deal. Munro knows full well that sex can be a glory and a torment, but it can also be a bargaining chip. </p> <p>The society Munro writes about is a Christian one. This Christianity is not often overt; it's merely the general background. Flo in \"The Beggar Maid\" decorates the walls with \"a number of admonitions, pious and cheerful and mildly bawdy\":</p> <p>'THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD<br>BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS AND<br>THOU SHALT BE SAVED'</p> <p>Why did Flo have those, when she wasn't even religious? They were what people had, common as calendars. </p> <p>Christianity is \"what people had\" - and in Canada, church and state were never separated along the lines laid down in the US. Prayers and Bible readings were daily fare in publicly funded schools. This cultural Christianity has provided ample material for Munro, but it is also connected with one of the most distinctive patterns in her image-making and storytelling. </p> <p>The central Christian tenet is that two disparate and mutually exclusive elements - divinity and humanity - got jammed together in Christ, neither annihilating the other. The result was not a demi-god, or a God in disguise: God became totally a human being while remaining at the same time totally divine. To believe either that Christ was only a man or that he was simply God was declared heretical by the early Christian church. Christianity thus depends on a denial of either/or classifying logic and an acceptance of both-at-once mystery. Logic says that A cannot be both itself and non-A at the same time; Christianity says it can. The formulation \"A but also non-A\" is indispensable to it. </p> <p>Many of Munro's stories resolve themselves - or fail to resolve themselves - in precisely this way. The example that first comes to mind is from <em>Lives of Girls and Women</em>, in which the teacher who'd staged the high school's airy and joyful operettas drowns herself in the river. </p> <p>'Miss Farris in her velvet skating costume ... Miss Farris con brio ... Miss Farris floating face down, unprotesting, in the Wawanash River, six days before she was found. Though there is no plausible way of hanging those pictures together - if the last one is true then must it not alter the others? - they are going to have to stay together now.'</p> <p>For Munro, a thing can be true, but not true, but true nonetheless. \"It is real and dishonest,\" thinks Georgia of her remorse, in \"Differently\". \"How hard it is for me to believe that I made that up,\" says the narrator of \"The Progress of Love\". \"It seems so much the truth it is the truth; it's what I believe about them. I haven't stopped believing it.\" The world is profane and sacred. It must be swallowed whole. There is always more to be known about it than you can ever know. </p> <p>In a story called \"Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You\", jealous Et describes her sister's former lover - a promiscuous ladies' man - and the look he gives to every woman, a look \"that made him seem to want to be a deep-sea diver diving down, down through all the emptiness and cold and wreckage to discover the one thing he had set his heart on, something small and precious, hard to locate, as a ruby maybe on the ocean floor\". </p> <p>Munro's stories abound in such questionable seekers and well-fingered ploys. But they abound also in such insights: within any story, within any human being, there may be a dangerous treasure, a priceless ruby. A heart's desire. </p> <p>\u2022 Alice Munro's Carried Away: A Selection of Stories is published this month by Everyman (\u00a312.99).

  "<p>The 300,000 UK savers who had accounts with failed Icelandic bank Icesave will be lucky to get their money back by Christmas, it has emerged this week.</p> <p>After one of the most tumultuous weeks ever seen in the financial world, the Financial Services Authority on Wednesday night announced that Icesave was technically in \"default\" - thereby triggering payouts by the official Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).</p> <p>Around \u00a34bn of UK savers' money was in its accounts when it ceased trading after its parent company, Landsbanki, went into receivership on Tuesday. The FSA's announcement that the compensation scheme was being put into play ended a horrendous 36 hours for Icesave customers.</p> <p>But it means they now face a long wait - probably between two and three months. </p> <p>However, it could have been a lot worse. On Tuesday night, many faced losing any savings over \u00a350,000. </p> <p>The government here stepped in after Iceland allegedly refused to meet its compensation obligations. After a sleepless night, chancellor Alistair Darling allayed their worst fears by announcing that no saver would lose money as a result of Icesave's failure. </p> <p>After a further day, during which it tried to mount a rescue package that would have returned the savers their money earlier, the FSA placed Icesave in default. The Treasury said it had frozen all Landsbanki's UK assets and that it would be seeking to recoup its losses from the Icelandic government - in the courts if necessary.</p> <p>In a separate move this week the Treasury also arranged for more than \u00a33bn of UK savers' money held with other Icelandic-owned banks to be transferred to UK arm of the Dutch savings bank ING Direct. </p> <p>Around 160,000 savings customers of another high-paying internet bank, Kaupthing Edge, and savers with the Heritable Bank, are now ING customers.</p> <p>FSCS chief executive Loretta Minghella said: \"We know that many savers with Icesave are anxious about their savings. Following the chancellor's announcement today, people can be confident they will be repaid in full. </p> <p>\"We are working closely with all concerned on the practical arrangements to get people their money back as quickly as possible.\" Both Icesave and Kaupthing Edge attracted big deposits with the promise of some of the highest-paying savings accounts in the UK market.</p> <p>Kaupthing was paying 6.55% savings rates - while Icesave's cash Isa was particularly popular for Isa transfers.</p> <p>On Thursday, Kaupthing became the last of Iceland's big banks to fall under state control, effectively ending a short love affair between Reykjavik and the British saver.</p> <h2>Exposed ... the near fatal flaw</h2> <p>Icesave's collapse has exposed a significant flaw in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. A flaw unknown to most people.</p> <p>While customers were probably aware that the scheme guaranteed savers the first \u00a335,000 of their cash - upped to \u00a350,000 this week - if their bank collapsed, how many Icesave savers knew were they were reliant on the Icelandic government's compensation scheme?</p> <p>A close look at the FSCS's website reveals that people with savings accounts operated by UK divisions of banks headquartered elsewhere in Europe, usually have to rely, first and foremost, on that country's compensation scheme. These banks typically operate under little-known \"top-up\" rules in which the institution's host country pays the first segment, and then the UK compensation scheme coughs up the remainder up to the maximum limit.</p> <p>In the case of Icesave, consumers would have had to claim the first \u00a316,200 from Reykjavik and up to a further \u00a333,800 from the FSCS. But then, of course, the chancellor announced no UK saver would lose, and that they would probably only have to fill in one form to claim.</p> <p>Savers in ING Direct and Triodos Bank - whose parent companies are based in the Netherlands - rely on the Dutch deposit guarantee scheme which increased its maximum payout to \u20ac100,000 (\u00a370,700).</p> <p>Ireland announced it would guarantee all savings held in its accounts, and that is what some would say the UK government is now effectively offering following the chancellor's Icesave move.</p>",
  "<p>Fife, 2007: Cold case detectives DI Karen Pirie and DS Phil Parhatka are investigating the 23-year old bungled kidnap of an heiress and her child, during which the woman was killed and the young boy vanished. When a miner's daughter reports her father missing 22 years after his disappearance, this investigation is added to their workload. The background is the miners' strike of 1984, when Mick Prentice apparently broke ranks to join scabs in the south and never returned to his family, but there is mounting evidence to suggest that what actually happened was considerably less straightforward. Pirie and Parhatka make a wonderful duo, and skilful plotting makes the narrative zip along. What is most impressive about <em>A Darker Domain</em> is the social history - a moving yet admirably unsentimental picture of a strained and riven mining community, first emasculated and then destroyed as its heart is ripped out.</p>",
  "<p>You may already know your ordinary differential from your partial differential equation, but taking a postgraduate course in mathematics will take you away from the textbook to a world where you get to explore your own theories and try to figure out your own solutions. Universities are offering a range of courses in the subject, from pure maths to those mixed with finance and the sciences. While a master's might whet your appetite for further study, graduates are likely to be snapped up in a range of jobs, from banking and IT to meteorology <br>and engineering. </p> <h2>What will I study? </h2> <p><strong>Professor Dwight Barkley, director of postgraduate studies, Warwick<br>Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick </strong></p> <p>At Warwick we offer three different maths-related MSc degrees: a straight maths MSc, an interdisciplinary maths MSc and a financial maths MSc. The overall structure is the same in each case. One takes high-level lecture modules for about six months. In the case of maths and interdisciplinary maths, students choose from a broad range of modules; for financial maths the lecture modules are prescribed. During this same period students also meet with their supervisors and decide dissertation topics and begin significant background study for the dissertation. </p> <p><strong>Ozgun Toreyen, student, MSc statistics and operational research, University of Essex </strong></p> <p>I studied combinatorial and non-linear optimisation, graph theory, data <br>mining and statistical modelling. My thesis deals with solving complex optimisation problems using a multi-agent system based on game theory. </p> <p><strong>Matthew England, graduate, MSc applied mathematics, Heriot-Watt University </strong></p> <p>The MSc was a combination of eight taught courses, followed by a research project. Each course was examined by both coursework and a final exam. After that we then had to choose a research topic to work on over the summer. I wrote my master's dissertation on elliptic curve cryptography. </p> <h2>Why study maths? </h2> <p><strong>Barkley</strong> Each academic in our department would likely give you a different answer. A postgraduate degree is a means to establishing one's intellectual independence. People choose to do maths degrees because they love mathematics and want to do it professionally. Throughout an undergraduate degree one learns to understand mathematics, while the MSc degree provides the transition from learning mathematics to creating mathematics. </p> <p><strong>Toreyen</strong> I studied a postgraduate degree in maths, more specifically in operational research and statistics, because I believe that these have a critical role in strategical and analytical decision-making. </p> <p><strong>England</strong> I was approaching the end of my undergraduate degree when I decided I wanted to study a master's in maths. I had really enjoyed studying mathematics and I wanted to take it further. I did not want to get into further debt, so I restricted my search for a master's to courses that offered Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funding. </p> <h2>What are the job prospects? </h2> <p><strong><br>Barkley</strong> A major advantage of a maths degree is its versatility. We have had students go to Rover to work on car design or start an electronics company. IT and banking are generally popular destinations. A large number go on to do PhDs either at Warwick or elsewhere. </p> <p><strong>Toreyen</strong> The importance of these subjects arise daily, increasing the necessity for mathematics graduates. I want to work as an operational research and statistics consultant that structures the strategic-level decisions given by government ministries. </p> <p><strong>England</strong> I am now studying for my PhD at Heriot-Watt. I had enjoyed the research aspect, and wanted to continue. After my PhD I will look at both post doctorate positions and jobs in industry that use mathematics. </p> <h2>Can I get funding? </h2> <p><strong>Barkley</strong> Not from the government or Warwick. Our director of MSc studies calls it the perfect communist system. Everybody gets <br>the same: nothing. </p> <p><strong>Toreyen</strong> I had a Jean Monnet scholarship [funded by the European Commission] for my studies. It covered my tuition fees and a 12-month stipend. </p> <p><strong>England</strong> Yes, the EPSRC paid for my tuition fees, and provided me with living expenses.</p> <h2>Course links</h2> <p><strong>MSc maths, University of Warwick </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.warwick.ac.uk\">warwick.ac.uk</a> <br><strong>Cost</strong> \u00a33,300 full-time, \u00a31,980 part-time. <br><strong>Duration</strong> 1yr f t, 2yrs pt. </p> <p><strong>MSc in mathematical sciences, University of Essex </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.essex.ac.uk\">essex.ac.uk</a> <br><strong>Cost</strong> \u00a33,500 ft. <br><strong>Duration</strong> 1yr ft. </p> <p><strong>MSc in applied mathematics, Heriot-Watt University </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.hw.ac.uk \">hw.ac.uk</a><br><strong>Cost</strong> \u00a33,790 ft, \u00a32,050 pt. <br><strong>Duration</strong> 1yr ft, 2/3 yrs pt.</p> <p>(Costs for UK/EU students)</p>",
  "<p>Panicked investors yesterday pushed the index of Britain's top 100 companies to a four-year low as fears took hold that politicians had lost control of the worsening bank crisis. </p> <p>Brokers said concerns continued to plague the markets that individual efforts by G7 governments were proving haphazard and shares would fall as long as politicians were unable to arrest the deteriorating position of banks.</p> <p>London's FTSE 100 index slumped almost 9% to register its worst week since the crash of 1987. The FTSE 100 has plummeted 21% over the week - wiping more than \u00a3250bn off the value of stocks in the process.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by more than 600 points in the first few minutes of trading, but recovered some of its losses later.</p> <p>Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx in New York, said: \"There's a tremendous amount of emotion in the market. People are trading emotionally, rather than intellectually.\"</p> <p>Market participants said there was a sense of scepticism about political action to dampen the crisis, with few holding out much faith that governments can act in a united fashion to heal financial wounds.</p> <p>Big fallers in the US included the insurer AIG and banks Morgan Stanley, which saw its shares plunge 34%, making a 65% drop this week alone, along with Goldman Sachs, as investors waited uncertainly to see the precise form of aid and financial guarantees on offer from public authorities. </p> <p>\"Fear has been running rampant all over the street. Fear and greed, that's what rules the street,\" said Dave Henderson, a floor trader on the New York Stock Exchange for Raven Securities Corp. \"I think the carcass has been stripped to the bone.\" </p> <p>On the US markets, losses for the year to date have reached $8.3 trillion, based on falls in the value of 5,000 top publicly traded American companies.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 finished below the 4,000 mark at 3932.1 - its lowest close for more than five years. </p> <p><strong>Further falls</strong></p> <p>Chancellor Alistair Darling warned that it was \"essential\" that the world's leading economies took action to stabilise financial markets. </p> <p>Darling, in Washington for meetings of the G7 finance ministers and the IMF, said that it was not enough to \"just talk about these things\". </p> <p>However, most UK banking analysts advised their investor clients to steer clear of the sector until the shares had fallen further. </p> <p>Investment bank Credit Suisse led the way yesterday with a report declaring that while banks had fallen in some cases by more than 90% from stockmarket highs and to 80% of their basic asset value, investors should wait until they had fallen further before buying shares. </p> <p>Analysts said stockmarket falls on both sides of the Atlantic could be explained by other factors, including tough times for hedge funds, the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday and the febrile nature of stockmarkets, which can lead to panic.</p> <p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong></p> <p>Like other investors, hedge funds have been selling heavily in recent weeks. A quarterly redemption deadline, which allows investors to pull out their money from hedge funds each quarter, was reached at the end of September. Redemptions were understood to be high after a poor year for the industry, and forced many hedge funds to sell their stock market holdings.</p> <p>The Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur meant Wall Street's trading floors were less crowded than usual on Thursday, when the US markets suffered their biggest fall in percentage terms since 1987. A lack of volume can aggravate volatility, making swings in price wider than usual.</p> <p>For superstitious investors, Yom Kippur has resonance, coming shortly after the new year celebration of Rosh Hashanah. The great crash of 1929 began at roughly the same time of year, prompting an adage among Jewish investors that it is wise to \"buy on Rosh Hashanah, sell on Yom Kippur\".</p> <p><strong>Short-selling</strong></p> <p>A temporary ban on \"shorting\" nearly 1,000 financial stocks expired in the US at midnight on Wednesday, just hours before Wall Street suffered its worst plunge of the week. This meant that hedge funds could resume the pariah-like practice of betting on a fall in the shares of fragile companies. There are suspicions that short-sellers were instrumental in a sudden collapse in the shares of General Motors and Morgan Stanley, both of which had been previously shielded by the ban. </p> <p><strong>Panic</strong></p> <p>Unadulterated panic has set in for many private investors who are afraid to stand by while their nest eggs shrink. In the US, private ownership of shares is much more common than in Britain, and many people have been liquidating tax-efficient retirement accounts, known as the 401k.</p> <p>\"The market is just panicked,\" said David Whys, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. \"Everybody just wants to get their money and put it under the mattress.\"</p> <p>Unprecedented sums of money are being pumped into government bonds, and other \"safe havens\" such as gold and platinum are seeing prices rise.</p>",
  "<p>Shortly before 8.00am on Wednesday Gordon Brown and a group of aides swept through a secure passage in Downing Street.</p> <p>As armed police held open glass doors, which normally screen visitors, Brown hurried along the link between No 10 and the Cabinet Office and into Britain's answer to the White House's \"situation room\".</p> <p>Minutes after announcing that he would gamble \u00a3500bn to save Britain's banking industry from collapse, Brown was heading into the government's Cobra room to chair a meeting of his economic war cabinet.</p> <p>Britain's emergency centre is more modest than the US equivalent. For a start its title are the initials of a dull name: Cabinet Office Briefing Room A. Its walls are adorned with numerous plasma screens, so as Brown briefed ministers and advisers on what would be remembered as one of the most dramatic economic announcements by a British government, which had been released at 7.30am, everyone could see the impact when markets opened at 8.00am.</p> <p>One screen showed the FTSE falling in response to declining Asian markets. But ministers noticed that two of the screens showed more encouraging news: shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, two of the most vulnerable banks, were going up.</p> <p>\"It was early days to test the market reaction but if the shares in those banks had tanked it would have been very bad,\" one source said. The sight of the tickers heading upwards at the start of a day during which \u00a357bn was eventually wiped off the value of shares, may prove to be symbolic. </p> <p>Crucial, but tentative, steps were taken to avoid a collapse of the country's banks which could have precipitated a 1930s-style depression. But Britain faces a slog before its banks are restored to full health; in the meantime a recession is all but guaranteed.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, revisited his jibe about Gordon Brown's \"remarkable transformation from Stalin to Mr Bean\" to illustrate how the landscape has been transformed. \"Gordon is back to Stalin again, more confident and knowing what he is doing,\" he said. Brown's fans see such remarks as a sign of how politics has shifted, as a strengthened prime minister outfoxes the Tories who look out of touch as the champions of light regulation. By contrast David Cameron, who marked out new territory in the week when he called for some City bonuses to be capped, believes the Tories are in a strong position. He says the crisis highlights criticisms he has been making for years, such as the danger of too much debt.</p> <p>Beyond the sniping one thing is beyond doubt: Brown is back at the centre of events, taking decisions, working his international contacts and thumping his fist, mostly in the direction of Iceland to protect British interests. But he is treading a fine line: his plan could either come to be seen as the model of how to avoid a depression or a waste of taxpayers' money that will drive up taxes and borrowing and lead to stringent public spending cuts.</p> <p>For a man who is often criticised for his failure to juggle more than one political ball at a time, Brown showed unusual dexterity last Saturday evening as he waited for his jet to take off from Villacoublay military airfield on the outskirts of Paris. Shortly after leaving the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, where the leaders of the EU's \"big four\" had met, the prime minister took a series of calls on three special mobile phones as his plane waited to fly back to London.</p> <p>Tom Fletcher, his private secretary, had the three phones patched through to the \"switch\" in Downing Street. The No 10 operators had lined up ministers, soon to be ex-ministers and world leaders to speak to the prime minister. In all, \"switch\" arranged more than 160 phone calls between Friday and Sunday for Brown as he carried out his reshuffle, which saw Peter Mandelson return to the cabinet. </p> <p>Ministers say the return of Mandelson has had a calming effect. Brown has become more relaxed and confident. \"It's a bit like picking up a tennis racket when you haven't played for years,\" one senior figure said. \"If you're good you never lose the technique.\"</p> <p>The partnership is more than personal. As business secretary, Mandelson is one of Brown's main economic advisers, a role he played over the weekend as it became clear that the government was facing a grave crisis. On the day before the Paris summit the government started reeling in its advisers.</p> <p><strong>High stakes</strong></p> <p>Naguib Kheraj, a veteran dealmaker and safe pair of hands, was called on Friday. Just a day into his new job as chief executive of JP Morgan Cazenoze, Kheraj was joined by David Soanes and Robin Budenberg, big names at Swiss bank UBS. David Mayhew, the grandest City gent of them all and the chairman of Cazenove, was also prevailed upon.</p> <p>The stakes were high. Whispers had started in the City that Darling and Brown were planning something big to deal with the crisis which, in the past fortnight forced them to orchestrate the takeover of HBOS and part-nationalise Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p> <p>While the government was been dealing with the troubles on a case-by-case basis it was becoming apparent to anyone who would listen that this piecemeal response was not going to be enough. During daily meetings between Darling and the bosses of the high street banks, it was dawning that there was now a danger that the entire banking system was on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>The mood started to darken in Downing Street early on Sunday when George Osborne, shadow chancellor, went on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show and called for Britain's banks to be recapitalised. Brown thought Osborne had let slip secret government plans still under discussion after a private briefing. The Tories say Osborne did nothing wrong because the bones of the rescue were posted by the BBC's business editor Robert Peston on his blog on Saturday.But the speculation meant Darling had no choice but to say that nothing was being ruled out when he was asked about Osborne's remarks on the programme.</p> <p>If Osborne was a predictable source of annoyance for Brown, the next irritant came as a surprise. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to suggest late on Sunday that her government would guarantee the bank deposits of all private investors in Germany.</p> <p>Her remarks nearly blew apart Brown's rescue as it appeared that Germany was following the example of Ireland which was offering a 100% guarantee. But it turned out that Merkel had meant to outline what was in effect the British position on private depositors: no explicit guarantee, but an implicit understanding that nobody would be allowed to lose out. </p> <p>Sunday's messy events led to what one government source described as the \"very turbulent start\" to trading on Monday. Amid this uncertainty Darling addressed MPs on Monday afternoon. There were expectations that he would copy the 100% Irish guarantee and admit the government was considering a part-nationalisation of the sector. In reality he said nothing to reassure markets. Darling's deadpan delivery set the tone for a difficult meeting between him and the chief executives of the major banks later that afternoon. It prompted another blow to the government as a source familiar with the meeting briefed Peston that Darling was told to \"pull his finger out\". The government appeared to be losing control.</p> <p><strong>Unsettled</strong></p> <p>Even London's early birds were yet to stir when Darling slipped out of No 11 and into his government car at 4.50am on his way to a breakfast meeting with fellow EU finance ministers in Luxembourg . As he was driven to the meeting on his arrival there Darling's mood rapidly darkened as he read on a Blackberry Peston's account of his meeting with the bankers the night before. Peston, who posted his report at 7.00am, had been briefed by an \"idiot\" in the banking fraternity, according to the government.</p> <p>The report, which once again unsettled the markets, enraged the government which realised that it would have to rush forward its rescue . Nos 10 and 11 decided that they had no choice but to indicate on Tuesday afternoon that a major announcement was on the cards....#65279; At 5.00pm the first of a series of meetings, lasting through most of the night, kicked off when Darling met Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, and Adair Turner, the head of the Financial Services Authority, in the dining room of No 11. </p> <p>Despite protestations that this was not a crisis meeting, it clearly was. Darling was wheeled out to the TV cameras at 8pm and promised an announcement before the stock market opened at 8am on Wednesday. He gave no details because there were no details.</p> <p>Then Darling met the bankers for the second time in 24 hours. In the early hours of Wednesday , an agreement was struck to boost bank capital, inject more liquidity into the system and make it easier to fund themselves in the financial markets - the three problems that dogged the City since Northern Rock ran into trouble a year ago. </p> <p>Brown, famously derided for his caution and inability to make decisions, put his signature at 5.30am to one of the boldest economic announcements by any prime minister. Just over a year after Brown's premiership had started its slide with the first run on a British bank since the Victorian era, the government had outlined a plan which he hailed by the end of the week as a model for the world. \"The lesson of the US plan is that you only get one shot at this,\" one government source said. \"When you fire the bullet it has to hit its target.\"</p> <p>It took a modest figure to puncture the buoyant mood which had seen Brown trounce Cameron in the Commons a few hours after the announcement when the Tory leader appeared to lurch to the left with a call to block city bonuses.</p> <p>As ministers assumed the mantle of patrician Tories, with lectures on the dangers of state intervention in boardrooms, Cable warned of a fresh crisis. At least eight London boroughs that were in danger of losing millions of pounds invested in the Icelandic Landsbanki, Cable told Darling during his statement on the rescue package. By the end of the week it became clear that the exposure of councils in Iceland was presenting the government with another big headache. Using unusually florid language, Brown denounced Iceland and took the remarkable step of using anti-terror legislation to freeze the assets of its ailing banks. Britain was angry because Reykjavik was refusing to offer the same guarantee to British depositors that was being given to its own citizens.</p> <p><strong>Regulation</strong></p> <p>The threat to the councils underlined that the rescue plan marked the beginning, rather than the end, of a bumpy road. One senior Labour figure summed up the mood: \"If we ensure that a depression is avoided, and we only suffer a mild recession, then we will have come off very lightly.\"</p> <p>The prospect of a recession, after more than a decade of sustained economic growth, has created a sombre atmosphere as politicians assess their prospects. All sides agree that the landscape has been transformed as both Labour and the Tories count the cost of a light touch to City regulation.</p> <p>There is also a consensus that Brown is strengthened. One senior Labour figure said: \"By September the cabinet was on the edge of a nervous breakdown ... It would be ludicrous to say one reshuffle can transform things, it is certainly true to say it has created an entirely different mood.\" </p> <p>Another senior figure Labour added: \"Gordon has got a second audience with the public.\"</p> <p>Many ministers believe that Brown's besting of Cameron in the Commons on Wednesday highlighted deep flaws in the Tory approach as they come to terms with a world in which the state has an active role in saving the economy.</p> <p>Tony Lloyd, the chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, said: \"The tectonic plates have shifted and we will never again be in the position of the Thatcher and Reagan years. That has been swept away by the excesses of the private sector in the lead up to these days.\" Cameron will hope that the financial crisis vindicates him on three fronts. One senior Tory said: \"Gordon Brown's idea - that the government should not have a view on the amount of debt - has been proved wrong. His view is the economy should be let rip to provide taxes to help the poor.</p> <p>\"He has been more neo-liberal than any of predecessors. We do not take that approach. When we criticises newsagents for selling chocolate at a discount we were not being trivial. We are showing we reject market fundamentalists.</p> <p>\"Finally, in a recession the idea of high spending and high borrowing in the economic good times goes out of the window. The left are claiming this all as a big victory. As we head into a downturn there will be calls for tax cuts and for the government to live within its means. That is very helpful for us.\"</p> <p>Cameron is citing Lombard Street, the work on banking by Walter Bagehot, the father of Britain's constitution, written in 1873. </p> <p>This argued that individual banks should not be saved when they fail, but the resources of the state should be rallied to rescue banks when there is a systemic failure.</p> <p>\"We moved to a systemic failure when the House of Representatives voted against the Paulson plan,\" one senior Tory said.</p> <p>\"At that point we offered immediate bipartisan support for the government because we feared they would not have the courage to do what they eventually announced this week.\"</p> <p>When Bagehot's work was mentioned at an early crisis meeting among senior Tories, Cameron didn't need to be briefed. \"I did get a First, you know,\" he said.</p> <h2>Landesbanki seizure: How terror law was used</h2> <p>The freezing order for the UK assets of the Landesbanki, including funds of the Icelandic government, was made under authority of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001. </p> <p>The act was the response to September 11 2001. It created powers to \"freeze the assets of overseas governments or residents who have taken, or are likely to take, action to the detriment of the UK's economy\". </p> <p>The move is suprising, since Iceland is not a terrorist threat, and the act is described by the government as intended to \"cut off terrorist funding ... in the light of the new situation arising from the September 11 terrorist attacks\".</p> <p>The Treasury's order on Wednesday covers cash, deposits, shares, interest and credit, held or controlled by Landsbanki. The order made it an offence for UK banks or any other organisation to make Landsbanki funds available - for example, allowing withdrawals from its accounts or cashing cheques - without specific permission from the Treasury.</p> <p>Landsbanki has been added to a list of more than 7,000 individuals and organisations that includes al-Qaida, the Taliban, and the governments of Iran, Sudan and Zimbabwe.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"We have frozen assets of a company based in Iceland to protect the financial stability of the United Kingdom.\"<br><strong>Afua Hirsch</strong></p> <h2>Foot: we were right</h2> <p>At the end of a momentous week, one veteran politician believes he has been vindicated. Michael Foot, left, the former Labour leader who turned 95 in July, was derided for the 1983 election manifesto, known as \"the longest suicide note\" in history. Yet its call for greater state control of the economy, and to \"exercise... much closer direct control over bank lending\", now seems prescient. \"Capitalism doesn't work successfully forever,\" Foot said yesterday. \"In times of great crisis you have got to take the kind of measure we were advocating. This was the alternative to the Thatcher society, which was threatening horror and mass unemployment on an even bigger scale than the terrible things happening now. All that was prophesied by us.\"<br><strong>Nicholas Watt</strong></p>",
  "<p>A teenager accused of killing an 11-year-old boy as he walked across a pub car park admitted that he had \"just shot someone\", and that he was later cleaned up with petrol to remove gunshot residue on him, Liverpool crown court heard yesterday.</p> <p>Sean Mercer, 18, an alleged Crocky, or member of the Croxteth Crew gang, is accused of murdering Rhys Jones on August 22 2007, as the boy walked home from football practice. </p> <p>Mercer, of Croxteth, Liverpool, denies murder.</p> <p>The court heard that Mercer arrived at a friend's house and told that friend's grandmother \"that he had just shot someone and a kid had gone down\". Mercer gathered his friends by phoning them on their mobile phones and asked them to meet him that evening, it is claimed. </p> <p>Mercer and four friends went to an industrial estate in Kirkby, where Mercer's clothes were destroyed and he was cleaned with petrol to rid him of any remaining gunshot residue, the jury heard.</p> <p>On September 11 2007 police recovered three empty petrol cans from the industrial unit owned by Mercer's friend Melvin Coy.</p> <p>A silver Specialized Hard Rock mountain bike frame, believed to belong to Mercer, was found by a passerby on waste ground 250 metres (820ft) from the industrial unit a day after the shooting occurred. The bike had the same serial number as Mercer's machine, and was later handed to police following a media appeal. A DNA swab that was taken from the bike showed the cycle had been in contact with Mercer.</p> <p>The teenager, who was arrested three days after Rhys died, had a prepared statement read by his solicitor putting forward a defence of alibi. At the time of the murder, Mercer said, he was at a friend's house. He refused to answer any questions put to him.</p> <p>Wayne Brady, 20, the alleged intended target of the bullet that killed Rhys, gave evidence yesterday.</p> <p>Accused of being a member of the Nogga Dogz gang, Brady told the jury he had asked his two friends - his cousin Kevin Davies, 19, and another boy - to wait for him while he went to speak to his former girlfriend. He said he had wanted to \"apologise for some things\" to Vicki Smart. His friends waited for him by a container near the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, while he spoke to her.</p> <p>Brady said: \"I heard gunshots. Three, it sounded like three.\" He said he could tell the direction they were coming from but not exactly where. His friends \"dropped their heads down and pedalled as fast as they could away from the pub to the shops\". He added: \"I got off straight away, I just went the opposite way from where it sounded like they [the shots] were coming from.\"</p> <p>The prosecutor, Neil Flewitt, asked: \"When did you first find out a little boy had been shot?\"</p> <p>Brady replied: \"Vicki pulled up and said there's a kid lying dead on the floor over there.\" He abandoned his bike and went to a friend's house and was driven back to Norris Green, he said.</p> <p>Flewitt said one of the defendants, Boy M, 16, accepted most of what was alleged against him. \"However, it is his case that he is not guilty of the offences with which he is charged because he was, at all times, acting under duress.\" He was not exercising free will \"but rather was acting out of fear of Sean Mercer who had told him that he had shot a kid and who had demanded his assistance in avoiding detection\". </p> <p>During the course of an interview with the police, Boy M admitted that he had got rid of a hat and gloves that Mercer had left with him.</p> <p>James Yates, 20, Boy Q, 17, and Boy M are charged with disposing of the murder weapon, alleged to have been a Smith and Wesson .455 revolver.</p> <p>Gary Kays and Coy, both 25, are accused of providing transport for Mercer after the shooting. All five are accused of disposing of clothing and Boy M with getting rid of Mercer's bike. Boy K, 17, is accused of assisting an offender by disposing of the weapon, and possessing two guns and ammunition. They deny all charges.</p> <p>The trial, which is expected to last between six and eight weeks, continues.</p>",
  "<p>She is one of the most popular paintings in the National Gallery, whose rather unfortunate looks inspired illustrations for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. But one question has always puzzled: did the poor lady really look like this? </p> <p>Today the Guardian can reveal that she did and was suffering from an exceptionally rare form of Paget's disease - an abnormality of the metabolism that enlarges and deforms the bones.</p> <p>The portrait, An Old Woman, painted by the Flemish artist Quinten Massys in 1513, is popularly known as The Ugly Duchess and will be part of the National Gallery's eagerly awaited exhibition Renaissance Faces: Van Eyck to Titian, which opens next Wednesday. </p> <p>Curators are particularly excited about this painting because two important discoveries have been made in recent research: firstly, the portrait is truthful and she almost certainly looked like that, and secondly, a long held historical theory that the painter was copying Leonardo da Vinci is wrong.</p> <p>The medical research shows that she was suffering from an advanced form of Paget's disease - osteitis deformans - which enlarged her jaw bones, extended her upper lip and pushed up her nose. It also affected her hands, eye sockets, forehead, chin and collarbones.</p> <p>\"This woman must have been very, very unfortunate,\" said Michael Baum, emeritus professor of surgery at University College London who, with his student Christopher Cook, investigated the portrait. </p> <p>\"I've always been intrigued by this painting. It's fascinating because it is so meticulously and lovingly painted. You think, why would someone go to so much trouble in order to paint such a grotesque image? I always suspected there was something more to it than just a study in grotesquery.\"</p> <p>Baum regularly takes medical students on his \"National Gallery ward round\" and gave Cook the task of proving his Paget's disease theory. \"He did the most meticulous research, I gave him top marks. It was a beautiful piece of work, utterly convincing.\"</p> <p>Paget's disease is named after Sir James Paget, the British surgeon who first described it in the late 19th century, and more commonly affects the lower body such as the pelvis and femur. When it does affect the skull it is normally just the cranium so the woman - whoever she is - was suffering from a particularly rare form. \"I have certainly never seen a full-blown case like this,\" said Baum. In all probability, the condition would have happened later in life so she may even have been a beauty before the condition set in. Aside from the effect on her looks, she may have suffered no more than headaches and a damaged pituitary gland, said Baum.</p> <p>Baum is also convinced that the sitter would have been \"a very powerful woman and may even have been a real duchess\". He said: \"I reckon the artist was paid a princely sum to do it because who is going to buy a painting like that? Artists had to make a living. I think the painting is probably quite a close likeness.\"</p> <p>It remains one of Baum's favourites. \"You either love it or you hate it and I love it, it's part of the background of London, part of London's iconography.\"</p> <p>The other research is important in an art historical context. Experts have often written about how similar the Massys painting is to two Leonardesque drawings that are supposed to reflect a lost original by Leonardo from about 1490. The assumption has been that Massys imitated the works but the National Gallery research suggests that this was not the case. Susan Foister, curator of Renaissance Faces, said: \"We can now say with confidence that Leonardo - or, at least, one of his followers - copied Massys's wonderful painting, not the other way around. This is a very exciting discovery.\"</p> <p>Foister said they had discovered that Massys made amendments as he went along, suggesting he was making a study from close quarters. Also, in the two Leonardo copies, the forms of the body and clothes are oversimplified and the woman's left eye is not in its socket. </p> <p>\"It was always assumed that a lesser known northern European artist would have copied Leonardo and it has not really been thought that it could have been the other way round,\" said Foister. She added that both artists were known to be interested in ugliness and exchanged drawings \"but credit for this masterful work belongs to Massys\".</p> <p>Foister is less convinced that the woman was necessarily a powerful noblewoman but said it could not be ruled out and she welcomed the debate. \"He must have spotted this unfortunate old lady and chose her as the perfect model to paint from the flesh.\"</p> <p>The painting - one of the most popular in the National Gallery, according to Foister - inspired Victorian illustrator John Tenniel to make the Duchess (the unpredictable, Cheshire Cat-owning baby abuser) one of the most grotesque characters in his illustrations of the Lewis Carroll classic.</p> <p>Massys painted The Old Woman as part of a pair. The other, The Old Man, is being lent to the National Gallery and will hang alongside The Old Woman for the first time in 150 years. </p> <p>Rather unfairly from the duchess's point of view, the exhibition will include portraits of some of the prettiest and most porcelain-skinned women painted, including Palma Vecchio's La Bella. The Ugly Duchess may not have been a beauty but, as Foister points out, \"it is a beautiful painting\".</p> <p>\u2022 Renaissance Faces: Van Eyck to Titian, National Gallery, October 15-January 18</p>",
  "<p>I am the ink in the squid.' An interview with Grace Jones is studded with statements like this. At first, my response is, 'How do you mean?' But after half an hour of increasingly off-the-wall replies, I give up and go with the flow. After another hour, a bottle of wine, a couple of sambuca shots and some impromptu howling at the moon, when she mentions again that she is the ink in the squid, I find myself nodding my head and saying, 'Yes, Grace. You are ... ' </p> <p>We are in Julie's, a Notting Hill restaurant that is used to stars, but would rather not have them hanging around late into a Monday night. The waiter is getting crotchety. Our dinner was set for 8pm, but Grace was more than two hours late. I didn't mind - her manager Brendan and I had a lovely meal - especially because, when she arrived, she was contrite, in her own way. 'I'm sorry. I'm running for President!' she kept shouting; meaning, I assume, that she's really busy. She'd fallen asleep, having been up all last night working with controversial video director Chris Cunningham. A night owl by nature, for the OMM shoot with Perou, Grace rolled in five hours late, at 10.30pm, but then stayed until past five in the morning, wielding guns and at one point even being trussed in ropes and dangling from the ceiling. She loved it. </p> <p>'It was like sky-diving, amaaaaazing, beautiful, the ropes were like a spinal chord,' she tells me, as we settle in a small room off the main restaurant. 'I will do it again, completely naked.'</p> <p>Not bad for, well, however old she is: Grace is vague about her age, but she's at least 58, possibly 60. You'd call her a game old bird, except she's far more fabulous: slash cheekbones, full lips, small, glittering eyes. Hat pulled down hard, black Issey Miyake trousers. Slim, still. 'Arms like legs!' she guffaws. 'Put your hand around my wrist.' She throws herself backwards and waves a flip-flopped foot at me: 'And my ankle. Yes! Feel how skinny.'</p> <p>Just a few minutes with Grace Jones and you begin to understand the notorious Russell Harty incident of 1981, where she whacked Harty live on TV for talking to another guest. She is uninhibitedly physical, with herself and others; as likely to chuck herself to the floor as to jump on your back. At several points during our chat, she kisses my hands, strokes my face. She does a pervy tongue waggle at the crotchety waiter, who is not impressed. 'Oh dear,' says naughty Grace. 'I don't mean to offend.' And she sprawls full length on the banquette, roaring with laughter.</p> <p>What a hoot she is. Not at all as I expected. Not scary. </p> <p>'No, I am not scary,' she agrees. 'But I can play it and I am very stubborn. If you ask me and I don't want to, I go, \"No. No. No. No. No. No.\" You know, like in Sexy Beast ...' She means Ben Kingsley's terrifying gangster, Don Logan. I do know. Does she deliberately wee on the bathroom floor as well? </p> <p>'Ahahahahhah! Maybe. I'm not going to tell.'</p> <p>Grace Jones's scary reputation dates back to the early Eighties, when she and her then-boyfriend, French photographer Jean-Paul Goude, went all out with her striking looks. Goude's photographs transformed Grace from a human being into a masculine-feminine skyscraper with cropped hair and sharp shoulders, an angled edifice. Dominatrix film parts followed: Zula, in Conan the Destroyer, and a Bond villain, May Day, opposite Roger Moore in A View to a Kill. Grace's cartoon image was enhanced by her choice of boyfriends, post-Goude: blond, body-builder types such as Dolph Lundgren and Sven Ole-Thorson. The picture is complete: a superwoman, stronger than any man.</p> <p>Still, that doesn't entirely explain the awe which she inspires. She is commonly called an icon - 'You know, I don't know what that means' - and, yes, partly that's down to her image, which subverted the mainstream fetishisation of black women. Partly, though, it's because of her friends. She was Andy Warhol's muse, had Keith Haring paint her body, Helmut Newton and Robert Mapplethorpe take her photograph. But also - and this is strangely overlooked - it's her music. </p> <p>'Pull up to the Bumper', 'My Jamaican Guy', 'Nightclubbing', 'Slave to the Rhythm', 'The Apple Stretching' ... the list goes on. Brilliantly produced, utterly unique, her best tracks married Caribbean reggae and New York club rhythms with Grace's spooky vocals: half-sung, half-spoken; threatening, sensuous, intimate, distant. Roisin Murphy is a known worshipper and you can see and hear Grace's influence on the new crop of art poppers like Santogold. And unlike much of the synth-laden Eighties sounds that are enjoying a revival at the moment, Grace's songs still sound cool. </p> <p>'That Eighties revival, it doesn't exist, actually,' sniffs Grace. 'There is some Eighties music that is just timeless. The melodies, the lyrics... I called it church. Church in club. You can shout and dance. The best of the Eighties was club church.'</p> <p>It's interesting that she mentions the church, as, despite notions that she arrived from space, she was actually brought up in a very religious household. And her new record, Hurricane - her first release for 20 years - is the first that speaks directly of her family, on a couple of tracks: 'William's Blood' and 'I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)'. </p> <p>But there are some years to pass before we get to Hurricane. Twenty, in fact: the time since she last released a record. Why so long? Well, her working relationship with Chris Blackwell broke down (he was the founder of Island Records and produced Warm Leatherette and Nightclubbing), though they remain friends. 'It was very personal but we both understood each other ... this doesn't work, it's a crying thing.' Two albums never saw the light of day; producers came and went. Then Island was bought by Universal, which kept releasing repackaged greatest hits, consigning her to the past. </p> <p>So, she 'went underground'. She continued to act in films such as 1995's Cyber Bandits (me neither). She would pop up in Ibiza, in New York, in Vegas, playing gigs, corporate PAs. Some of these, reportedly, were more miss than hit. Not that she really cared. Ant Genn, who co-produced Hurricane, with Grace and Ivor Guest, compares her to Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennett: 'They went in and out of fashion, but they just kept performing, kept plying their trade. Grace is like that. And when she gets it right, she's as good as Michael Jackson or Prince. She's that level of performer.'</p> <p>As she proved at her show at Massive Attack's Meltdown this June. It was quite the hottest ticket this year: and Grace didn't disappoint, stalking the stage in a series of ludicrous Philip Treacy hats, throwing herself into the audience, growling and yowling, unleashing that voice while shaking her tush in naughty basque and thong. </p> <p>She showcased some of her new tracks at that show: this new LP has given her focus after the wilderness years. Hurricane came about through Treacy introducing Grace to Ivor Guest, who sounds like a joke from I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue but is actually a musician, purveyor of soundtracks and moody beats. Guest played her some of his material; she loved it and he became her producer, rescuing tracks that were written as long as 15 years ago. He also became her boyfriend. Go girl! Ivor is 39. And he's the Viscount Wimborne, a blue-blood directly related to Winston Churchill and Princess Di. How very Grace. Though, annoyingly, she doesn't want to talk about their relationship. 'Too personal,' she says, and gives a filthy laugh. 'Passionate friends, darling.'</p> <p>Anyway, the result of their hook-up is Hurricane, which sees her collaborate with Tricky, Brian Eno, Wendy and Lisa, Sly and Robbie, as well as with her own mother and son. It's a good record, though Grace's manager, Brendan, tells me he had quite a time shopping it round to the majors. None were interested ('too scared'); the independent Wall of Sound was the only label that would give her a deal. Well, phooey: all the naysayers must be kicking themselves now. Grace is really having a moment. Everyone wants her. So Brendan is happy, though he's had some hairy times. She won't go on stage unless she's been paid, in full, in cash, up front. </p> <p>'The record is the key,' says Grace. So, let's talk the record. I do try, but it's hard to get specific with her. 'William's Blood' is about family, yet when I ask her how many brothers and sisters she has, she says: 'Guess ... We were six. Then seven. Then eight.' This turns out to mean that her parents had six children - Grace is the third-born, first daughter - then, 10 years later, another one came along and, after that, they adopted a girl. Grace tells the truth, but not straightforwardly: she plays with words, repeating them, rolling them around her mouth like fine wine. Her voice keeps changing, too: she takes on my Mancunian accent, which is weird to hear ('the fooll mont-eh!' she screeches about stripping off) and often sounds like she's translating in her head, perhaps from French. </p> <p>Anyhow, I bash on and we establish some certainties. Grace grew up in Spanish Town, Jamaica, with her grandparents: her mother and father were working in the USA. It was a strict childhood, dominated by the church. She went three times a week: 'force-feeding, darling'. Both sides of her family were religious: there are many bishops in her family, including her younger brother (Bishop Noel Jones, who preaches on American TV), her father and step-grandfather. </p> <p>Grace inherited her theatricality from her father, the Reverend Robert Jones: 'The pulpit was his theatre.' The music comes from her mother's side:born Marjorie Williams, she has a lovely voice. You can hear her singing towards the end of 'William's Blood'; she also did backing vocals on 'My Jamaican Guy' but couldn't be acknowledged, for fear of upsetting the church elders. Marjorie's father was musical, too: he played with Nat King Cole. Grace remembers a newspaper photograph of him, only really shown as a threat, as the terrible thing she might become if she didn't watch out. Their church simply did not approve of anyone using their talent other than to glorify God. </p> <p>So how did her family react when Grace went the wrong way, became a pop star? She gets quite upset when she talks about this: her eyes glisten, she thumps the table. </p> <p>'I hated my dad, he was so strict. But now I love him, because they didn't make him bishop for a long time because of me. There was an article in Ebony magazine about me with a photograph of the family around the piano. My dad wasn't in it, but the fact that it was released in a magazine ... he was supposed to cut me off, like in the Bible it says, If your right arm offends, you cut it off. He said, \"I don't care, I support my daughter\". But it held him back.' Grace is cagey about her relatives: 'I don't talk about this. It's not just me, it's all my family looking at it.' Plus, she's making a documentary with Sophie Fiennes on this very topic and appears to be saving her most intimate confessions for that. To add to the confusion, she uses familial terms loosely: I had heard that her father had died, but this turns out to be her step-grandfather; she calls one brother, Christian, her twin, but tells me, 'I can't tell the truth about that one. Twin has more to do with the spiritual than the blood.'</p> <p>It's clear, though, that her background is the making of her: 'It was blinded [she means blinkered]. Run like the horse. There was nothing else to see but the church. But that's what charged my imagination.' A shy child, with just one school-friend, she was good at sports, and enjoyed the drama of Jamaica: the storms, which brought floods - 'mud pies' - and lightning, which scared her. Bishop Noel has said in the past that Grace was beaten as a child, but: 'I don't remember bad things. They just go away.' </p> <p>At 13, she joined her mum and dad in Syracuse, New York, a difficult time made worse by the fact that she and Christian were prevented from singing in church together because Christian was so clearly gay. Grace started planning her escape: she began acting, joining a theatre group in Philadelphia run by a teacher known to her parents. From there, she ran away with a motorcycle gang and eventually, in her late teens, gravitated to New York proper, looking for acting work and forging a successful modelling career. </p> <p>She made it to the cover of Vogue, though she never took modelling seriously. 'Modelling was all in between things, just to pay the rent. But then I shaved my eyebrows, shaved my head and they didn't like that and I was, \"OK, I'm out of here.\" I was a go-go dancer, too. I called myself Grace Mendoza, to fool my parents. When was that? I don't know. I don't remember dates.' </p> <p>At one point, she lived in Paris, with Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange. 'We were very anti-male, when the men tried to come in we would just boot them out. We were horrible.' Paris is one of her spiritual homes: London another; also Venice, Jamaica and New York, where she has an apartment. Her son by Jean-Paul Goude, Paulo, lives in Paris now, as does his father. Grace would have liked to have another child: after they split up, she asked Goude if he would give her some sperm so she could artificially inseminate herself, but he refused. Paulo is also a musician: he has a band called Trybez and wrote a song, 'Sunset Sunrise', for Hurricane</p> <p>Paulo is 28, born in 1979, just as Grace's career went stratospheric. How was that?</p> <p>'I went jungle,' she says. 'I took him everywhere. Like elephants or lionesses. I didn't go on his time, he went on mine. You have a child that is three, four months, how are they going to dictate to you what to do? Also, it depends on the kid. Some kids you know by their character that they're all right.'</p> <p>Grace laughs and gestures at Brendan, who's joined us, to give her one of his cigarettes. 'You can't smoke in here,' he says. 'Shut the door,' she demands. 'I'll smoke out the window.' The window actually gives out on to another part of the restaurant. Not that that is going to stop Grace. 'What are they going to do? Arrest me? Put me in jail?' The waiter comes in and gets even more crotchety, but Grace waves him away, declaring that it's not a cigarette, it's incense and could he fermez la porte when he leaves. She finishes off the bottle of red wine and orders a double sambuca. And things start going haywire.</p> <p>Grace notices the full moon, up above. 'My moon is in Scorpio,' she declares. 'I'm feeling horny. Be careful.' Brendan decides that she's had enough of the interview. Grace pooh-poohs him and I refuse to stop: 'We haven't even talked about New York yet!' I howl, and Grace settles down again, though she keeps kissing my hand. </p> <p>New York, apparently, was 'like church. Dancing. Music was the priest. It was absolutely church, celebration, dancing, punches were spiked.' And Warhol, Haring? 'Artists who you meet on the Yellow Brick Road ... ' She won't be pinned down further, though she does say that what she likes is to work with artists who know what they want. Her preferred medium, in the end, is performance: like an actress, she wants to be directed and she adores feeling the love of the audience. She has been asked to do a residency in Vegas, but she won't: she went to see Diana Ross perform there and was shocked to find that she had to do two performances a night. 'I asked her how she did it, and she said, \"You just hold back on the first show.\" I said, \"I can't do that. It's cheating the audience.\"'</p> <p>Next, she tells me the story of another track - 'Love You to Life' - the true story of one of Grace's lovers who was in a coma for several weeks, and came round in front of her. 'When their eyes first open and you just magically happen to be there, there's a look in the eye that you'll never forget. Like a birth. Wooooow! It was amazing.' His first word was Grace. </p> <p>After that, she makes Brendan and me stand up and howl at the full moon. Grace puts her arms around both of us, her head thrown back, leading the attack. She's like electricity, I think to myself: her chaos fuses with other people's energy and creates action, a spark. She announces, again, that she's the ink in the squid. And I agree with her.</p> <p>It is half past midnight. The interview, if you can call it that, is over. There are no other customers in the restaurant. We stomp to the bar, where Grace gets out a big wodge of cash and offers to settle the bill, a shock in itself. She is the only pop star in my 20 years of interviewing who has ever done this. </p> <p>I pay; she shoves a tenner at the barman and orders another double sambuca. 'Father, Son and Holy Ghost,' she says, and whacks it down. We chat about the music that's playing: the Stones, the Doors. Then she jumps. </p> <p>'Turn away, go away,' she orders Brendan, who does, the little git, trotting outside for a cigarette. Grace takes my face in her hands and strokes it.

  "<p>When Zo\u00eb Heller came to talk about Notes on a Scandal at the Guardian book club, readers debated the motivations of its leading characters with a rare intensity. There seemed no doubt about the most pressing question: what did we think of Barbara? Heller and her readers kept agreeing that this supposedly horrible narrator keeps saying things that are true, and often funny. A reader who told us that others with whom she had discussed the novel all thought Barbara was \"evil\" confessed that she found her often \"sadly sympathetic\". She gave us examples from the novel of Barbara's pathos and her cameos of her own loneliness. \"Did you want that? Did you feel that she was sympathetic in some way?\" she asked.</p> <p>In contrast, another reader found herself having to contradict Barbara's nasty vision of her pupils and her fellow teachers. She was herself a teacher, in \"that kind of place\", where \"a lot of teachers like their students\". She could imagine, she said, what the \"atmosphere in the staffroom might actually be like\", even though all we had was a picture seen through the \"horrible prism\" of Barbara's perception. Was there a hint of professional protest in the tone of her subsequent question? \"I wondered whether you've invented all this, or whether you've been hanging around in staffrooms?\" There had been no research, the author replied. It was all based on her experiences as a schoolgirl at Haverstock Comprehensive School in Chalk Farm, north London. </p> <p>Heller had conceded early on that the monstrous Barbara sometimes spoke her own sentiments. This prompted some readers to ask directly whether particular judgments that she made were really the author's own. Observing the affair between art teacher Sheba and her 15-year-old pupil Steven Connolly, Barbara opines that she knows who holds the power in the relationship (and it is not the sexually intoxicated middle-aged woman). Was this Heller's view too? And if so, what about Barbara's following thought: that the affair \"didn't do him any harm whatsoever\"? \"Is it you talking through Barbara?\" \"No it's not - it's Barbara being Barbara.\" But the novel was intended to show how difficult it could be to pass judgment on sexual behaviour. Sheba was besotted and Steven had \"an eye to the main chance\".</p> <p>Someone else wondered whether Steven had been made a sufficiently sympathetic character and Heller conceded that, by design, he was something of a cipher. After all, he is \"refracted through two unreliable consciousnesses\". We know him only through Barbara's version of Sheba's account of him. And what about Sheba? One reader who said that she found the book gripping was also perplexed, and asked - as if it were the simple question that could never be answered - \"Why is Sheba having sex with Connolly?\" The lure of \"unembarrassed adulation\", replied the novelist - and being stuck with \"a bit of a pompous husband\". \"I think you throw out more clues than that,\" interjected another reader, who recalled Sheba's peculiar confession to a \"maternal feeling\" for the boy with whom she is having such a risky sexual adventure. Another reader thought she was \"a child trying to be an adult\", and that the boy with whom she has a relationship is the only person who treats her like an adult.</p> <p>In the end Barbara overpowers her and she returns to a kind of childhood. Heller thought this entirely accurate. Sheba had found herself married to a middle-aged man when she was just a young student. Echoing from television sets, as a background to the action, was Prince Charles's marriage to Diana, another almost-child bride.</p> <p>The reader with the maternal theory rather brilliantly contrasted Sheba's descriptions of the physical freshness of her teenage lover, the delight of his smell and touch, with the distaste for others' bodily emissions that Barbara expresses. \"There's a lot of stuff about bodily fluids in the novel - I picked it out when I reread it.\" She mentioned the narrator's peculiar speculations about fellow teacher Sue's use of panty-liners and then recalled vividly for us the scene where Barbara visits Bangs, the maths master, and has to go through his bedroom, with its musty smell and display of male toiletries. There was a \"theme\" here surely. It was as if Barbara's undertone of physical disgust left us and Sheba to be allured by the freshness of a youthful body. No wonder she does what she does.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London. Next week he will be looking at Behind the Scenes at the Museum by Kate Atkinson.

  "<p>I walked along our high street looking for signs of fear. The woman in the newsagent said things weren't too bad, the greengrocer said trade was down a little but not as much as his competitors'. The wine merchant said people were still drinking as much, though buying cheaper bottles Monday to Thursday and saving the pricey stuff for the weekend; they must be staying at home more, he said, and avoiding restaurants. None of this seemed to amount to the pop-eyed fear that Franklin D Roosevelt summoned up in his \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" speech. </p> <p>\"Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror\" was how he went on to describe it during his inaugural presidential address in 1933 (an event which came in the middle of a stock market crash, to which his words were at least party directed). But then fear doesn't always have a visual manifestation - frantic queues outside a bank, or the old lady with glasses looking up at a Cossack sabre in Battleship Potemkin. Neither is it always easily articulated. </p> <p>\"It looks as though it's going to get rough,\" I said to the greengrocer. </p> <p>\"Yeah, very, very rough,\" the greengrocer replied, handing me my grapes. </p> <p>No more was said. At Canary Wharf, London, things were the same. The escalators at its tube stop always promise to deliver you into a thriller. From deep down in the station you can see the sky - a white horizon across which silhouettes pass like Alfred Hitchcock's in one of his films. When I reached the top I saw a cheering newspaper placard, TYCOONS LOSE BILLIONS IN CASH, but otherwise life looked normal, or what has passed for normal in the last dozen years. It was lunchtime and the sun shone. News of stock price movements and exchange rate fluctuations ran around the curves of the Thomson Reuter building on its twinkling signboard. On a big TV screen, somebody that nobody had ever heard of had won the Nobel prize. The crowd beneath ate, drank and studied its BlackBerrys. Smollensky's, Carluccio's, the Slug and Lettuce - names that one day will suggest a different age, like ABC teashops do the war - all had their tables full. </p> <p>I walked east as far as Cartier Circle and looked across the Thames at the dome. When I worked at Canary Wharf in what was known as \"the tower\", because in 1994 there was only one, only a fraction of this townscape existed. From our offices on the 18th floor we had clear views in every direction. To the west we looked towards St Paul's, down a road lined with office blocks that had actually been completed: we called this The Avenue of the Rise of Capitalism. Towards the east and Essex was The Avenue of the Decline of Capitalism - abandoned building plots that looked as though they might never see a digger again. Here it was just possible to see the outlines of Canary Wharf's original function; until the 1970s it was a dock where fruit was unloaded from the islands of the same name. Recession had halted further progress; its owners were so desperate for tenants, and its rents so cheap, that even marginally profitable businesses such as newspapers moved in. But then recession turned to boom, history was obliterated, and Canary Wharf resumed and eventually fulfilled its ambition to be Manhattan in Europe. </p> <p>Even now, the brakes have still to be applied. Developers and speculators may be frantically doing the maths in private, but the evidence on the ground suggests ever onward and upward. Around Cartier Circle, lorries deliver more concrete, steel and glass to builders in hard hats. In a shopping mall already stuffed with little luxuries, Charbonnel et Walker promise that a new \"chocolate cafe\" is coming soon. Canary Wharf's weekly free sheet splashes with a story that a new development, Wood Wharf, will have a 200-metre tower, offering 25,000 permanent jobs, though it won't be completed before 2019. </p> <p>Where is the fear here, that \"nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror\"? Our prosperity may be approaching a chasm - a global recession of a kind not known in our lifetime - but the chocolate soldiers of Charbonnel et Walker bravely advance. Yet everyday life has always been a poor guide to the future. Old habits die hard. Arnold Bennett, one of the last century's most observant diarists, writing two days after Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, noted: \"A great crowd of holiday makers at Clacton in the showers yesterday. No difficulty about getting change for a \u00a310 in gold and silver. At the fish shop, slight increases of price in poultry and eggs.\" </p> <p>And so at Canary Wharf I abandoned the search for outward signs in other behaviours and examined myself. During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, I stood on the school playing fields and looked back at the school and thought, \"All this might vanish.\" Time of day, weather, location: all are still vivid in my memory. Not since then, not even after 9/11, have I known such brooding anxiety or such a compulsion to watch the BBC news. It doesn't seem shameful to me. </p> <p>Roosevelt tried to give fear a bad name with his rhetoric - surely the \"nameless\" is included, wrongly, only because politicians deploy adjectives in threes. In fact, it is one of our most useful emotions. As Joanna Bourke points out in her study of the subject (Fear: a Cultural History), \"We are right to fear. A world without fear would be a dull world indeed. It is sobering to contemplate a world where parents did not fear for their children or where death was as insignificant as eating a meal.\"</p> <p>Think of its accomplishments. Road safety, smoking bans, carbon-emission charts, law enforcement of all kinds, the human creativity born out of fear of loneliness or rejection. Fear, says Bourke, quoting an earlier writer, \"must have been the first and for a long while the most powerful of all the traits of human mentality, the one from which the higher faculties had to evolve.\" It was fear that cured the Cuban crisis. A little more of it in the years leading to 1914 might have saved the lives of many of the bathers that Bennett saw on Clacton beach. Fear also leads to curiosity. How come Iceland, a tiny nation built on thermal springs and shrinking fish stocks, had so much money apparently at its disposal? The question might have prevented several British charities and local authorities from making investment decisions that now look like folly. </p> <p>Perhaps fear's importance has dwindled, or perhaps been repressed, as an ever-present component of modern feeling. Bourke's book, tellingly, never explores its influence on financial markets, perhaps because she was writing it in the early 2000s when great slumps seemed historic and terrorism a new thing. To learn how economic fear shaped the lives of our ancestors, we need older texts. </p> <p>Home from Canary Wharf, I dipped again into Studs Terkel's great work of oral history, Hard Times, which recounts hundreds of individual Americans' stories from the great depression as seen from the perspective of 1970. In one way or another, fear marks most of them. The account of Virginia Durr, an elderly woman in Alabama, ends the book. </p> <p>\"The depression affected people in two different ways. The great majority reacted by thinking money is the most important thing in the world. Get yours. And get it for your children. Nothing else matters. Not having that stark terror come at you again.\" The second? \"A small number of people who felt the system was lousy. You have to change it.\" </p> <p>As fear's engulfing wave rolls into our lives again - rough, very rough - it seems safe to bet that the same division will become more and more apparent, and in the same proportion.</p>",
  "<h2>Calvisano v Cardiff Blues</h2> <p>Today, 1.35pm BST, Centro San Michele</p> <p>Cardiff Blues have travelled to the north of Italy with a bit of a swagger. Calvisano have won only two of their 36 Heineken Cup ties and the strength of David Young's backline is illustrated by the fact that Jamie Roberts, the strapping Wales wing, sits on the bench with Young making seven changes from the side that won at Sale last weekend. Tom Shanklin and Jamie Robinson form the centre partnership and Jason Spice is back at scrum-half.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Ben Evans, the Calvisano prop, will be looking to impress against his old team-mates.</p> <h2>Clermont-Auvergne v Sale</h2> <p>Today, 1.35pm, Marcel Michelin, Sky Sports</p> <p>These were always going to dangerous waters for the Sharks. Clermont led France's Top 14 last season and are difficult to beat here and Sale kick off without two key players. Andrew Sheridan has an arm injury and Mathew Tait is out with a hamstring strain. Lionel Faure is a decent replacement for the prop but Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9's decision to leave Charlie Hodgson on the bench and start with Richard Wigglesworth at No10 is a gamble.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie, the Clermont captain and wing, has scored 16 tries in this competition.</p> <h2>Dragons v Glasgow Warriors</h2> <p>Today, 2.30pm, Rodney Parade</p> <p>Paul Turner's Dragons are the least successful of the Welsh sides in the competition and this match is their best chance of a victory in a fiendishly difficult pool that contains Bath and Toulouse. Turner has given a first start to the 35-year-old Colin Charvis since the veteran back-rower joined the coaching staff this summer. The Scotland centre Graeme Morrison makes his 100th appearance for the Warriors.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Dan Parks, the Warriors' Scotland stand-off, can dictate games with his reliable boot.</p> <h2>Edinburgh v Leinster</h2> <p>Today, 1.35pm, Murrayfield, Sky Sports 2</p> <p>Leinster put 49 points past Edinburgh two seasons ago but this lunchtime's meeting at an echoing Murrayfield will be close. The Irish province have flattered to deceive in this competition but their pack has been strengthened by the arrival of the Springbok prop CJ Van Der Linde and a backline containing Brian O'Driscoll and Luke Fitzgerald looks dangerous. Mike Blair, a candidate for the Lions scrum-half spot, will be a key man for Edinburgh.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Jamie Heaslip, the Leinster No8, will be looking to repeat his European form of last season.</p> <h2>Gloucester v Biarritz</h2> <p>Today, 5.30pm, Kingsholm, Sky Sports 2</p> <p>Mike Tindall, Gloucester's captain, admitted his side had choked in the past in this competition and, with trips to Biarritz and Cardiff to come, his side have to win this evening. Dean Ryan has picked Ryan Lamb at No10 with Olly Barkley at inside-centre alongside Tindall. There was a cloud over Kingsholm yesterday with the news that James Forrester, their talented No8, had been forced to retire at 27 after a succession of injuries.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Magnus Lund, the England flanker who left Sale last summer, is wearing the No6 shirt for Biarritz.</p> <h2>Ulster v Stade Fran\u00e7ais</h2> <p>Today, 3.30pm, Ravenhill</p> <p>Stade have to show this season that their gaudy new shirts are not the only colourful thing about the Parisians. Stade may be France's top side but they often rely too much on their powerful pack, which today includes the Scotland No8 Simon Taylor in the second row. Ulster, who lost most of their leading players in the summer and won their first game last week, play the former London Irish flanker Kieron Dawson at No7 while Paddy Wallace is in the centre</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Juan-Martin Hernandez, Stade's brilliant Argentinian fly-half, would catch the eye in any shirt.</p> <h2>Scarlets v Harlequins</h2> <p>Today, 3.30pm, Stradey Park, Sky Sports 2</p> <p>The last European game at Stradey Park will be a lump-in-the-throat affair but the Scarlets need to keep their emotions in check. Harlequins' reserves pushed the Ospreys all the way in a cup tie in Swansea last weekend and Dean Richards' side will not be pushovers. Richards chooses Tom Guest at No8 ahead of the England international Nick Easter, who is on the bench, while Charlie Amesbury takes the injured David Strettle's place on the wing.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> David Lyons, the experienced former Wallaby No8, adds extra power to the Scarlets back row.</p> <h2>Leicester v Ospreys</h2> <p>Tomorrow, 1pm, Welford Road, Sky Sports 1</p> <p>This could be the tie of the weekend. The Ospreys, whose victory over the Tigers in the EDF Energy Cup final, led to the sacking of Leicester's coach Marcelo Loffreda, are buoyant. But Gavin Henson, who is suspended, and Sonny Parker, who is injured, are missing from their centre and Tommy Bowe fills in at No13. Martin Corry is in the second row for the Tigers, who have their Springbok Derick Hougaard shadowing Toby Flood on the bench.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Richard Hibbard, the Ospreys hooker, is an outside candidate for a Lions place.</p> <h2>London Wasps v Castres</h2> <p>Tomorrow, 3pm, Adams Park</p> <p>This week's training ground punch-up between Danny Cipriani and Josh Lewsey has been a major distraction for the 2007 European champions as they search for only a second win of a troubled season. Cipriani is back at No10 and Lewsey plays at outside-centre and the Wasps pack, with seven England internationals, is back at full strength. The Australian Lachlan Mitchell is at full-back for Wasps, who should be too strong for the French club.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Danny Cipriani will hope to put his week behind him and pull the strings at fly-half.</p> <h2>Toulouse v Bath</h2> <p>Tomorrow, 3pm, Stade Ernest Wallon, Sky Sports 1</p> <p>For Steve Meehan, who dips his toe into water for the first time in Europe's top competition, there could be no more difficult start for a coach. But Bath are playing some attractive rugby and have the boost of having their strapping wing Matt Banahan back after injury for the first time in a month. Justin Harrison, whose duel with Fabien Pelous in the second row is key, is also fit after injuring his shoulder. It would be a major shock, though, if Toulouse lose.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Yannick Jauzion is still the best centre in the northern hemisphere on his day.</p>",
  "<p>The sudden departure of Newcastle United's vice-president, Tony Jimenez, will not, it seems, spark the collapse of the \"Cockney Mafia\" management structure put in place by the owner, Mike Ashley. Newcastle fans had hoped Jimenez's exit would lead to the departure of the managing director, Derek Llambias, and the executive director (football), Dennis Wise. But senior figures at St James' Park are adamant that Jimenez's desire to quit is not shared by the other key players in Ashley's unpopular regime. </p> <p>A club source said: \"There has been no indication from either Dennis Wise or Derek Llambias that they want to leave the club. Nobody knows how long it is going to take the owner to sell and the management structure will remain in place until they are told otherwise.\" </p> <p>Jimenez left his \u00a3750,000-a-year post on Thursday as he realised he would not have a job if the club were sold. As the club's main deal-maker, he had spent three weeks in limbo because Ashley no longer needed him to identify new players. Ashley, who is struggling to find a buyer to match his \u00a3300m asking price, does not plan to invest in the team even if he has failed to sell the club before the January transfer window. Jimenez had been hired because of his supposedly extensive contacts in European football, but his critics have pointed out these appeared to start and finish in Spain. Of the five players Newcastle signed in the summer, only the former Liverpool midfielder Danny Guthrie was not playing in La Liga. </p> <p>It is unknown whether Wise has anything more to do at present as head of recruitment, although the former England international does have wider responsibilities, including the overall control of the academy. With Ashley sidetracked by other business interests, Llambias is running the club on a day-to-day basis and is said to have been unaffected by the protests against the board. Although Ashley and Wise no longer attend Newcastle games because of the strength of feeling against them, Llambias sat next to the interim manager, Joe Kinnear, during last weekend's 2-2 draw at Everton.</p>",
  "<p>As European fans bask in the glow of a new Heineken Cup season, the rumblings of discontent from the rest of the world grow ever louder. Down a crackling phone line from Wellington yesterday, there was even a stark global health warning from Steve Tew, chief executive of the New Zealand Rugby Union. According to Tew, the International Rugby Board urgently needs to address the \"player drain\" from south to north if it wishes to safeguard the long-term future of Test rugby.</p> <p>It is Tew's view that the sheer number of New Zealanders, and others, plying their trade overseas is a worry for the game in both hemispheres. It is now possible, for example, to pick a side composed purely of Heineken Cup-registered Kiwis, several in the prime of their careers.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt the player drain is having an effect on people here,\" said Tew, reiterating his union's \"concern\" at the widening gulf between rugby's haves and have-nots. In light of the global economic crisis, he fears for All Black rugby - \"We just can't compete on the financial front\" - unless something is done to reduce the one-way traffic.</p> <p>As a direct consequence, proposals to revamp the Super 14 are being considered, including a suggestion that franchises such as the Crusaders and the Hurricanes revert to their original provincial identities (as Canterbury and Wellington, respectively, in this instance) in order to boost waning interest and reduce costs. Expanding the competition to allow for more domestic fixtures and reduce the amount of air travel back and forth to South Africa and Australia is another option. The penny has finally dropped that players are not just embracing Europe for the money, but for a more varied and stimulating rugby diet.</p> <p>Tew, furthermore, believes it is not only New Zealand who should fret about the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of this year's Heineken Cup. The development of home-based players, he says - not to mention coaches - is being stifled by all the ex pats.</p> <p>\"You do wonder whether the real hurt will be felt by the unions whose competitions these guys are playing in. There are, for example, a very small number of French-qualified props in the French league. It won't be a surprise if the French scrum comes under pressure in the November internationals and the Six Nations. England have got a similar issue with the number of overseas players wearing the No10 jersey.\"</p> <p>The latest medical bulletins suggesting Jonny Wilkinson will not resume playing for five months following knee surgery - he will now struggle to feature in the Six Nations, reducing his chances of going on next summer's British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa - highlight that recurring headache.</p> <p>Either way, an understandable whiff of Kiwi jealousy and self-interest is discernible, made worse by the limited availability of leading All Black players for the domestic Air New Zealand Cup. Tew, however, says he is going in to bat for every sparsely populated rugby nation struggling to keep up with the big spenders.</p> <p>\"What has concerned us lately is what we consider to be the incredible amounts of money on offer to our players in the United Kingdom and particularly in France, where we think the player market is completely out of control.</p> <p>\"We've been saying to the IRB for some time that international rugby is under threat if the player market continues to grow without a parallel increase in revenue. What will probably come out of the current financial crisis facing the world will be a reality check.\"</p> <p>The implication is that, in rugby's case, that might not be such a bad thing. \"While there are obvious benefits for players there are pitfalls. Our view is that common sense needs to prevail and more reasonable market values should be paid for our players. They've got skills which they should be free to trade and we're incredibly aware that we live in a global market. But if we want Test rugby to be the pre-eminent product - which our players and everyone else tell us they do - then you've got to keep it intact.\"</p> <p>Even in New Zealand, though, they are now having to consider what has always been seen as the nuclear option: picking foreign-based players for the All Blacks. The pressure would be unbearable if Dan Carter's imminent move to Perpignan was for more than a six-month sojourn but, for now, the NZRU's fingers remain wedged in the dyke.</p> <p>\"Even if we were to pick our overseas-based players for the All Blacks it wouldn't be the same,\" said Tew. \"They wouldn't be available for the Tri-Nations, for example, because that falls outside the IRB international window. We'd be picking a worldwide All Black side in June and a home-based one in July and August. Our current thinking is that's a step too far.\"</p> <p>A further storm is brewing closer to home. This week the Queensland Reds signed the All Black flanker Daniel Braid from Auckland as the first overseas player to be recruited under the Australian Rugby Union's new \"foreign player policy\". With the former Crusaders coach Robbie Deans at the helm of the national team, there is a possibility that the Wallabies could lure several promising Kiwi youngsters across the Tasman. Such players could then become eligible for the green and gold via residency.</p> <p>\"It's an interesting development which we're watching closely and talking to the Australians about,\" said Tew, coldly. New Zealand's reputation as world rugby's conveyor belt is not in doubt, but the Kiwis are fed up with their rivals reaping all the benefits.</p> <h2>Foreign legion</h2> <p>How 14 All Blacks and a Maori make up a formidable Heineken Cup XV</p> <p>15 <strong>Ben Blair</strong> Cardiff Blues</p> <p>14 <strong>Doug Howlett</strong> Munster</p> <p>13 <strong>Luke McAlister</strong> Sale</p> <p>12 <strong>Aaron Mauger</strong> Leicester</p> <p>11 <strong>Regan King</strong> Scarlets</p> <p>10 <strong>Dan Carter</strong> Perpignan or</p> <p><strong>Nick Evans</strong> Harlequins</p> <p>9 <strong>Byron Kelleher</strong> Toulouse</p> <p>or <strong>Mark Robinson</strong> Wasps</p> <p>1 <strong>Greg Somerville</strong> Gloucester</p> <p>2 <strong>Tom Willis</strong> N-G Dragons</p> <p>3 <strong>Kees Meeuws</strong> Scarlets or</p> <p>4 <strong>Simon Maling</strong> Scarlets</p> <p>5 <strong>Paul Tito</strong> Cardiff Blues*</p> <p>6 <strong>Filo Tiatia</strong> Ospreys</p> <p>7 <strong>Marty Holah</strong> Ospreys</p> <p>8 <strong>Xavier Rush</strong> Cardiff Blues</p> <p>*Represented New Zealand Maori but not the All Blacks</p>",
  "<p>(For the benefit of anyone reading this column for the first time) Lisa, she's explaining to me, has told her boyfriend she's visiting Sweden so she can secretly spy on him in the hope of catching him being unfaithful. (And no, that wouldn't seem reasonable if you'd arrived earlier.)</p> <p>\"I couldn't watch him 24 hours a day, of course,\" Lisa says (you'd think with a casual shrug, but actually with a sorrowful shake of her head), \"and I also had to be careful that he didn't spot me.\"</p> <p>\"Were you wearing a disguise? A wig or something?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>I bet she was.</p> <p>\"No,\" she repeats. (She bloody was.) \"But I still reckoned I could manage to keep a close enough check on him. Close enough so a woman couldn't slip through a hole, that is.\" She takes a serious draw on her cigarette and squints through the smoke as she exhales. It's not a little noir; Lisa is unmistakably immersed, and I wonder briefly if it's going to end with her pulling on a trench coat and, hard-bitten, muttering, \"Turns out it was the dame who first came into my office.\" (It's always the dame who first comes into the office.) Actually she continues, \"Another good thing was that I could call him, even if he appeared to be doing something innocent, just to see what he'd say he was doing when I asked him. He'd have no idea I could see because he'd think I was phoning from Sweden.\" How this is a \"good thing\" I can't quite grasp, but Lisa's expression suggests it should be self-evident. Surely women in general don't itch to be able to see what their partners are \"actually doing\" when they call and ask, \"What are you doing?\" Surely</p> <p>\"So, did all this work?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Lisa says. \"Yes.

  "<p>Confused and angry Icelanders were yesterday wondering why Britain appeared to be doing its best to push their country over the edge.</p> <p>A leading Icelandic economist has already warned that after a 10-year boom fuelled mainly by foreign debt, the exposed North Atlantic island probably was technically bankrupt and had few realistic options left other than to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help.</p> <p>But many Icelanders feel the British government in particular - which has used anti-terrorism legislation to freeze the assets of Icelandic banks in Britain, threatened court action to recover savers' deposits and described the actions of the Icelandic government as unacceptable and illegal - is making things a great deal worse.</p> <p>An analyst at Landsbanki, one of the three Icelandic banks nationalised this week, and who declined to be named, said: \"There's an anti-Iceland thing going on. But why? Why are you behaving like this? Is Gordon Brown happy to have a small, badly weakened scapegoat to distract attention? In any case, it's succeeded: Britain has destroyed whatever confidence there was left in Iceland.\"</p> <p>\"We don't understand,\" said Saeunn Kjartansdottir, a Reykjavik psychotherapist. \"In Iceland we have been told consistently that the Icelandic government has from the start of this crisis had every intention of paying their due to British savers. We have been told that our finance secretary said this very clearly to your chancellor. An then the very same day, Mr Darling appears on British televison and claims the opposite!\"</p> <p>The executive chairman of Kaupthing, Iceland's biggest bank, also accused Britain of being partly responsible for his bank's nationalisation on Thursday, saying it had stood a fair chance of weathering the storm until London's Financial Services Authority stepped in and sold its savings business, Kaupthing Edge, to a Dutch institution.</p> <p>Official reactions are more diplomatic. \"There seems to be a massive miscommunication here,\" said Finnur Oddsson of the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce. But even he professes to be confused by statements coming out of London. </p> <p>\"It is simply not true to say that Iceland has defaulted,\" he said. \"The Icelandic government has never said it will not pay. Certainly the message we are getting in Iceland is that these banks have been nationalised, that they have assets abroad and that those assets will be used pay off what British savers have in their accounts. And the government has said it will back all depositor guarantees.\"</p> <p>Icelanders readily admit that their banks, and a handful of young, aggressive entrepreneurs who bought up swaths of the British high street, have brought at least part of their present problems (and the country's) on themselves. \"The world was awash with cheap money,\" said Eggert Gudmundsson, CEO of the HB Grandi, the biggest fishing company, an industry that still accounts for half Iceland's exports.</p> <p>\"When things go well, the highly leveraged strategy these groups used is how you make the most money, the fastest. But it's also clear that when things go badly, that kind of high-risk approach means things can go very, very badly wrong. And it's fair to say that globally, things have gone just about as badly as they could.\"</p> <p>The past decade has been one of extravagance and excess for many in Iceland. \"It's been wild,\" said Hyvnir Fridfinnsson, the manager of b5, a smart bar-restaurant. \"One long party, really. We have groups of 100, 150 in here from banks and businesses, trying to outdo each other in how much champagne they buy.\"</p> <p>But Icelanders are surprised at some of their supposed allies. The prime minister, Geir Haarde, said the country had turned to Russia in search of a \u20ac4bn loan because EU partners had proved unwilling. Olafur Isleifsson, an economics lecturer, said there was disillusionment that America, too, which maintained a big military base on Iceland until very recently, had not volunteered.</p> <p>\"We need a little help from our friends,\" he said. \"Iceland will stay standing, but we are suffering perhaps more than anyone else in Europe from this, and we are a little disappointed by some of our allies.\"</p> <p>But besides the recklessness of some of its bankers and businessmen, Iceland is at the eye of the storm essentially because it, and the krona, are too small to sustain such a big financial system. A population of 300,000 people, operating in what Isleifsson calls \"the smallest currency known to man\", will always find life difficult in a tumultuous global market.</p> <p>For the Icelandic government, the krona's weakness means supporting its banks and their foreign debt is all but impossible. Nor can it hope to tackle soaring inflation and sky-high interest rates. In the long term, Iceland's future will lie in some kind of currency union or parity, and a return to its true assets: fish, and green, geo-thermal energy.</p> <p>\"I think,\" said Asbjorn Jonsson, a third-generation fisherman, \"that people have learned that money is not made in banks. It is made by real people working hard at real jobs. Actually, deep down we knew that all along. We just have to learn it again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's diatribes against Iceland have a hollow sound, because he and the Labour regime have been active participants in the creation of an economic order that has allowed greedy tycoons free play in a borrower's market (Lost in Iceland, October 10). An example of its absurdities is that any person with a big enough money bag can buy the football club of a place, the pride and joy of the working class. </p> <p>Iceland is now hit by a hurricane that started far away, but has reached new heights because of circumstances created at home. Common people like me certainly feel sorry for other common people who lose their savings, wherever they live, be it in Britain, the Netherlands or Iceland, and our government has declared its intention to do what it can to honour its legal obligations towards these people. Abuse from former comrades and threats of legal action will not accelerate the process. Here in Iceland not only savings are at stake, but jobs, houses and the economy as a whole.</p> <p>Icelanders have a long memory and long after the British have forgotten Mr Brown - a process I suspect will begin soon after the next general election - he might be remembered in Iceland as the man who kicked us while we were down. <br><strong>V\u00e9steinn \u00d3lason</strong><br>Reykjavik, Iceland</p> <p>Professors Buiter and Sibert (Letters, October 10) should be ashamed of their arrogance in accusing savers, however unimportant they may think them to be, of speculating in risky foreign investments. They say we ignored the fact that the credit default rates of the three large Icelandic banks were among the highest in the world last March. I, and I suspect most \"unimportant\" savers, haven't the foggiest idea what a \"credit default rate\" is. But I'm not a fool and I heed the advice that is available to me. A major source of this advice comes from the money pages of broadsheet newspapers and the many established money advice sites on the internet. The Guardian and most other papers and websites have had Icesave in the their best-buy tables until very recently. Is this really such imprudent behaviour?<br><strong> Douglas Ritherdon</strong><br>Maldon, Essex </p> <p>The government has used the anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic corporations which cannot, under any possible definition, have committed a terrorist act against the British people. How long before the next big crisis leads to the government using the act much closer to home against British citizens? Even a crisis as big as the one we are currently facing requires the law to be applied fairly and proportionately. If it is not, then faith in the legal system could be severely undermined. <br><strong>Simon Burall</strong><br>Lewes, East Sussex</p>",
  "<p>It built up over the course of the week, as supporters at the rallies of John McCain and Sarah Palin started randomly screaming \"terrorist!\" and \"off with his head!\" and \"treason!\" and even \"kill him!\" at the mention of Barack Obama's name.</p> <p>Then there was the man at a Florida rally who shouted at an African-American CNN cameraman: \"Sit down, boy.\" You don't need to know your history of the American south to know that \"boy\", directed at a black man, is overtly and undeniably racist.</p> <p>But things got worse on Thursday in Wisconsin, when a man stood up to \"ask\" a \"question\" and, veins popping in his neck, delivered himself of the following: \"I'm mad. I'm really mad. And what's gonna surprise ya is not the economy. It's the socialists takin' over our country. [Lengthy applause] Sit down. I'm not done. Let me finish, please [laughter] ... when you have Obama, [Nancy] Pelosi and the rest of the hooligans up there gonna run this country, we gotta have our head examined. It's time that you two are representing us, and we are mad! So go get 'em!\" [Extended chanting: \"USA! USA! USA!\"]</p> <p>Meanwhile, videos are circulating of McCain supporters expressing their views of Obama as they enter rallies. Is Obama a terrorist, they are asked? He's \"a one-man terror cell\". \"He's got the bloodlines. Just think about it, look at the name.\" \"Socialist swine.\"</p> <p>We are seeing, from (happily, at least for the time being) the majority of the country, much of what is good and decent about America in this election. But we are also seeing in smaller proportion what is chilling. The people in those videos have no proof to back up their beliefs, because of course no such proof exists. They just feel it, and that's enough. But that isn't what's most disturbing. There will always be such people in all societies. What's most disturbing is that McCain and Palin are egging them on. </p> <p>Not once in any of the above situations did McCain, a man who has subjected the rest of us to lectures about how important his integrity is, step in to say: \"Now wait a second, folks.\" To the Wisconsin man quoted above, McCain said: \"Well, I think I got the message. And could I just say, the gentleman is right.\"</p> <p>McCain and Palin are doing even worse than that. The emotional core of their campaign now is Obama's alleged close relationship with Bill Ayers, the former terrorist who, long before Obama came on the Chicago scene, was welcomed back into Chicago society and became an education professor. They are demanding that Obama confess the real nature of this relationship.</p> <p>Now usually, when a candidate calls on his opponent to own up about something, there is a specific allegation on the table. A newspaper has published an investigation, say, and the opponent hasn't yet confronted the charges therein, and the candidate demands that the opponent do so. Even if the candidate himself leaked all the material to the newspaper as a set-up so that the candidate could then, once the charges were \"impartially\" published, go out and demand the opponent come clean, well, that's how the game is sometimes played.</p> <p>But in this case, there are no serious specific allegations. Only dark intimations of intense ideological kinship. \"[Obama] has dismissed it by saying he was just a guy in the neighbourhood,\" McCain said in an interview. \"You know it's much more than that. Let's reveal all the details of that relationship and then the American people can make a judgment.\"</p> <p>McCain knows nothing specific here. He's fishing, wishing and hinting. Obama and Ayers served on a board and a commission together. Average people may not know how boards and commissions work, but McCain knows very well that they typically meet a few times a year and that co-board membership implies nothing about deeper friendship. More broadly, McCain also has to know that the entire issue is pathetic. Obama is now one of the most examined men in the world. </p> <p>No one has turned up actual evidence of radical beliefs. He's pretty much a standard liberal with, if anything, a cautious bent that seeks to placate adversaries, a picture we have on the authority of his former conservative colleagues at the Harvard Law Review, who found him an accommodating consensus-builder.</p> <p>This is standard guilt-by-association gruel that we expect to find on borderline-psychotic websites. But an alleged man of integrity ought to know better. And he does, I'm certain, understand the nature of the difference between asking a man to answer specific allegations and demanding that he disprove vague accusations (\"it's much more than that\"), and he knows how doing the latter will reflect on him.</p> <p>But he's a desperate man, watching his decades-long dream slip away, no doubt infuriated that this neophyte who hasn't suffered as he has is running circles around him. That's a shame for him, but McCain's mental state is not the thing to be worried about here. The thing to be worried about is the impact that his campaign - \"a national disgrace,\" wrote Joe Klein of Time magazine - is having on the nation.</p> <p> He and Palin - \"his Sancho Panza\", as George Will mockingly wrote in the Washington Post - are deliberately stoking rage that is based on lies that they know to be lies (well, that at least McCain knows to be lies). The normally reserved commentator David Gergen said: \"There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence. I think we're not far from that.\"</p> <p>We are seeing the dark, Gothic heart of resentment conservatism. It's going to be a disgusting three weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Being one of British comedy's best-kept secrets isn't a lucrative position to be in, but it's a badge Stephen K Amos can wear with his habitual debonair pride. To date, he's probably best known for a brief spell as a doctor in EastEnders, but it surely can't be long before his talents secure him a more permanent home on our television screens. As a comic, he's got the hard-won heckler-fighting skills of an act who's had to fight his way up, learning to hold his own in the roughest of clubs. But his material's a big step up from the kind of low-brow, crowd-control type humour you'd expect. An openly gay, black comedian who refuses to reduce his personality to a caricature for the sake of easy laughs, Amos doesn't make a meal of his liberal convictions. Instead, his stock-in-trade is a boisterous skewering of the pretentious, the illogical and the silly, and the sustained quality of his attack makes him one of the highlights of this week's Brighton Comedy Festival.</p> <p>\u2022 Corn Exchange, Wed 15</p>",
  "<p><strong>Up your time </strong></p> <p>Three hours a week will bring the best results, says Pilates expert Lynne Robinson. \"If you can't afford that, get a DVD or book to help you practise at home. Applying Pilates principles in everything you do helps, too, from how you sit at a computer to the way you stand in a queue.\"</p> <p><strong>Work out </strong></p> <p>For total fitness, you need to supplement Pilates with cardio work. \"We've got strength and conditioning covered, but it doesn't get your heart rate up,\" Robinson says. \"Cardio and Pilates go extremely well together: Pilates will help you move more efficiently in your chosen sport and it helps prevent injury.\"</p> <p><strong>Consider the alternative </strong></p> <p>Rather than on mats, Pilates can also be performed on apparatus, such as Reformers. \"Although sessions are more expensive, using apparatus gives quicker results if you're after body toning and conditioning.\"</p> <p><strong>Don't neglect the breathing </strong></p> <p>Founder Joseph Pilates spent a lot of time studying eastern practices such as meditation, and mastering the breathing that goes with the movements is vital. \"It cements the mind/body connection and brings control and focus, which are the keys to performing the movements perfectly.\"</p> <p><strong>Slow down </strong></p> <p>Unlike cardio work, the slower, the better applies in Pilates. \"Deep strength and endurance comes from performing the movements very slowly. Rushing through them will do you no good at all.\"</p> <p><strong>Shelve your competitive streak </strong></p> <p>\"Bend the technique to suit your body, rather than bending your body to suit the technique,\" says Robinson. \"It's not a competition, so ignore what your neighbour is doing and focus on performing movements to the best of your ability. Five quality repetitions are far more effective than 10 tired ones.\"</p>",
  "<p>Abdul-Lateef sits in the shade at the front of his shop, a glint in his eye and a week's growth of beard on his cheeks.

Photograph:  David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walk through the bustle of Fes's medina and it's impossible not to be catapulted back in time. It is as if the old city is on a frequency of its own, set apart from the frenzied world of internet and iPods and all the techno clutter that fills our daily lives. Abdul-Lateef and his magic-medicinal stall are a fragment of a healing system that stretches back through centuries, to a time when Fes was itself at the cutting edge of science, linked by the pilgrimage routes to Cairo, Damascus and Samarkand.</p> <p>These days the low-cost airlines shuttle the curious back and forth to Europe. And everyone they bring is tantalised by what they find. Fes is the only medieval Arab city that's still absolutely intact. It's as if a shroud has covered it for centuries, the corner now lifted a little so we can peek in. Once the capital of Morocco, Fes is one of those rare destinations that's bigger than mass tourism, a city that's so self-assured, so grounded in its own identity, that it hardly seems to care whether the tourists come or not. Moroccans will tell you that it's the dark heart of their kingdom, that its medina has a kind of sacred soul.</p> <p>Wander the labyrinth of narrow streets and you can feel it. It's all around you - in the meat bazaar, where shanks of mutton nestle on fragrant beds of mint, and it's down in the most ancient quarter, at er-Rsif, where the seed of Fes fell more than a thousand years ago. But perhaps the spirit is felt strongest of all at the ancient leather tanneries, whose dying pits have endured since the days of Harun al-Rachid.</p> <p>Visitors to other Moroccan cities like Marrakech, snatch up bargains without realising that many of the wares on offer are actually created within the old city walls of Fes. Stroll through the medina and you're never far from the sound of a craftsman beating a pattern into a sheet of burnished brass, or the hum of a homemade loom, or a lathe shaping a piece of scented argan wood. The slender side-streets are packed with hundreds of one-room workshops where master craftsmen toil from morning to night, as their ancestors have done since antiquity.</p> <p>Their wares fill the little tourist shops on Talaa Kabira, the medina's main thoroughfare. Unlike Marrakech, with its sprawling tourist emporia, there's an innocence about searching for a bargain in Fes. Many of the shops aren't geared to tourists at all. There are just as many outlets selling bath plugs, bras and sewing thread to the locals as there are those offering embroidered yellow slippers, kaftans and heavy metal castanets to the waves of tourists who flock through.</p> <p>Despite the giddying array of crafts manufactured by hand in the medina, Fes is about much more than the tourist objects for sale. Even the quickest visit gives you a sense of the city's extraordinary cultural and intellectual heritage, and helps to remind all who come of the achievements of the Islamic faith. The centrepiece of this is surely the Al-Karaouine university and its mosque (founded in 859 AD), regarded as the oldest continuously used centre of learning on earth (so says the Guinness Book of Records). Al-Karaouine is just one of dozens of medieval medrasas, religious schools, found in Fes. Thankfully, a number of these are now being restored, some of them with grants from Unesco.</p> <p>One of the most refined of all is the Bou Inania medrasa, which boasts fabulous mosaics, geometric cupolas crafted from cedarwood, and tiles carved with couplets from the Qur'an. Across the street from it stands the remains of Fes's once-grand medieval water clock, now ruined. And tucked away behind it, to the left of a fishmonger's stall, is the tiny jewel, Caf\u00e9 Clock. Although only open for a year or so, \"The Clock\", as it's become known, is already an institution, a confluence where visitors, expatriates and local Moroccans meet. It's laid out on numerous levels, its terraces commanding views over the city. The climb is so steep that a waiter with mountain-climbing experience was sought for the job.</p> <p>The Clock came from the imagination of an indefatigable Yorkshireman, Mike Richardson, for whom Fes was love at first sight. The outstanding food hints at Mike's background in catering - he was a ma\u00eetre d' at The Wolseley and, before that, at The Ivy. But Morocco is a long way from the West End. One of the first hurdles to overcome was the search for fresh ingredients, a quest that eventually led to a fusion of cuisine.</p> <p>Poised on the menu between caesar salad and cheesecake are the words \"camel burger\". Mike pushes back his mop of ginger hair and exclaims, \"I searched for years for the perfect meat for burgers, and I found it here in Fes. Camel meat's got the ideal consistency and succulence, and it sits so nicely on the bun.\"</p> <p>The burgers are by far The Clock's best-seller, so much so that Mike spends much of his time trawling the bazaars in search of fresh camel meat and the other ingredients needed for his secret recipe. But his cafe is about much more than slaking hunger pains. He feels a responsibility to highlight a little of the heritage for which Fes is so renowned. Each evening, after tucking into their burgers, visitors are invited to learn from Moroccan experts. There are regular lessons in the art of calligraphy, music and dance, and talks on local culture.</p> <p>In the last handful of years, quite a number of foreigners have dropped everything and moved to Fes. Most of them, like Mike, have been attracted by the gravity of the place, the kind of serenity that's absent in other more care-free tourist hotspots. You get the feeling that they can't quite believe their luck at having the chance to be living in such a magical destination.</p> <p>Lured by the prices and availability, many have bought courtyard homes in the medina and set about the painstaking restorations. Some of these have been transformed into small maisons d'h\u00f4tes, sometimes with no more than three or four rooms. One of the best is Riad Num\u00e9ro Neuf, a showcase of Moroccan decorative styles, adorned with all sorts of European antiques. The ceilings are cedar, painted by craftsmen centuries ago, the floors laid with mosaics. The central courtyard echoes to the sound of running water and birdsong. The view from the terrace is worth the steep ascent, and reminds you that you're tucked away in the depths of a labyrinth.</p> <p>One of the great joys of Fes is the feeling that it's worn in and loved, appreciated equally by visitors as by those whose families have lived there for centuries. If there's a downside, it's that a great number of the buildings are in need of repair in varying degrees. The climate is largely to blame - blazing hot in summer, freezing in winter.</p> <p>Unesco regards Fes as a world heritage centre and has supported the city, quite literally. Under its initiative, thousands of wooden staves have been put up to keep those buildings most in danger from falling down. Others are working to help in a more modest way.</p> <p>The American-born director of the city's Arab Language Centre, David Amster, has lived in the Fes medina for more than a decade. Passionate that any renovation be completed to the same exacting standards achieved by the original craftsmen, he ploughs anything he can spare into renovating public streets of his neighbourhood that are falling into disrepair. The focus is on micro-reparation, much of it aimed at correcting badly-done repairs made in the modern era. Amster's craftsmen strip walls of their modern cement finishing, replacing them with natural render, as was traditionally used, so allowing buildings to breathe once again. They use hand-made nails, and frown on the kind of uniformity that power-tools provide. The artisans tend to work at night when the streets are empty, in what is essentially guerrilla renovating. The idea of giving back to the community anonymously is appropriate of course, for anonymous charity is at the heart of the Islamic faith.</p> <p>Back on Tala'a Kabira, the medina's main street, Abdul-Lateef is crushing a mortar half-filled with dried damask roses. He coaxes his little son, Mustapha, to pay attention; after all, the boy will inherit the shop just as his father did. An American tourist pauses to photograph the front of the shop, before his wife reels over and barks for him to hurry up and get back to the group. When they have gone, Abdul-Lateef wipes a hand over his brow. </p> <p>\"If that man had time to spare I could give him some of this,\" he says, holding up the potion he's mixing. \"It's a special preparation that would make his wife beautiful again.\"</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Royal Air Moroc (020-7307 5800, <a href=\"http://www.royalairmaroc.com\">royalairmaroc.com</a>) flies to Fes from Heathrow via Casablanca from \u00a3215 (if booked online) rtn inc tax.

  "<p>Martti Ahtisaari, the former president of Finland, yesterday crowned three decades of painstaking mediation in some of the world's most intractable conflicts on four continents by winning the Nobel peace prize.</p> <p>The 71-year-old former diplomat and UN mediator was praised by Norway's Nobel committee for promoting \"fraternity between nations\" and for his tireless and self-effacing efforts. </p> <p>Ahtisaari's achievements range from helping end apartheid South Africa's control of Namibia and steering the country to independence in 1990, to last February's declaration of independence by the former Yugoslav province of Kosovo, whose peace plan and constitution were drafted by the Finn. </p> <p>In between, Ahtisaari negotiated a rapprochement between the Indonesian authorities and the breakaway region of Aceh, supervised the decommissioning of arms in Northern Ireland, and quietly brought Shia and Sunni factions from Iraq to Finland to bolster the chances of ending sectarian strife.</p> <p>\"Ahtisaari is an outstanding international mediator,\" said the Nobel committee citation. \"Through his untiring efforts and good results he has shown what role mediation of various kinds can play in the resolution of international conflicts. Throughout all his adult life Ahtisaari has worked for peace and reconciliation.\"</p> <p>Ahtisaari's efforts began in his early 20s when he went to Pakistan as a primary school teacher and Christian activist to engage in development work. A long career in Finnish diplomacy and in various UN posts culminated in a six-year term as president of Finland from 1994 during which he worked with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, to negotiate an end to the Kosovo war with Slobodan Milosevic in 1999.</p> <p>Uncomfortable in the public limelight, preferring quiet and painstaking diplomacy, Ahtisaari is a reticent and retiring man with a wry sense of humour and occasionally sharp tongue.</p> <p>Ahtisaari, a Liberal Social Democrat, told Norwegian television he was \"very pleased and grateful\" to have won the prize for which he has long been tipped. He said he wanted to cut down on his travels to spend more time with his wife and singled out Namibian independence as his proudest moment.</p> <p>He devoted years to southern Africa during the apartheid years, serving as Finnish ambassador to Tanzania, during which time he cultivated contacts with the Namibian guerrillas of the South West Africa People's Organisation before being made UN commissioner and then special envoy to Namibia.</p> <p>\"Ahtisaari combines, to great effect, immense personal charm with a tough, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is approach to conducting negotiations,\" said Gareth Evans, a successor to Ahtisaari as president of the International Crisis Group. \"He has had an extraordinary track record of commitment and success.\" </p> <p>Ahtisaari is disliked in Serbia as the architect of Kosovo's secession earlier this year and also in Russia, a place he knows intimately as a Finn born in the Karelian town of Vyborg which is now in Russia after being annexed by the then Soviet Union.</p> <p>He has explained that his experience of being uprooted from his native town as \"an eternally displaced person\" fired his determination to promote reconciliation and lent him the empathy and insight for the victims of ethnic conflicts.</p>",
  "<p>Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley nationalised, Halifax rescued, and every high street bank bailed out in the most dramatic few weeks in financial history. Meanwhile, Britain's mutual building societies have remained proudly independent, neither passing the begging bowl round taxpayers nor keeping their savers awake at night.</p> <p>So should we be saying \"bravo\" to our prudent building societies? After all, societies that demutualised - such as Halifax, Northern Rock, Alliance &amp; Leicester, and Bradford &amp; Bingley - all failed to survive in their own right, while the ones that stuck to their knitting are still here today.</p> <p>Or, as house prices tumble and arrears lengthen, are they just the next set of financial institutions that will be blown apart by the credit crunch? </p> <p>This week, Guardian Money surveyed every building society in Britain - all 56 - to find out how they are coping with the worst financial storm since the Great Depression. </p> <p>The first, and perhaps most crucial question, was about \"wholesale funding'. What does that tell us? It's how much of their finances they have to obtain from external sources. Given how banks have stopped lending to each other, a high percentage means the society could run into trouble. It's what brought the likes of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley to their knees. </p> <p>We also asked about mortgage loan-to-values (LTVs). That will tell you how risky their lending is - and how exposed they are to falls in house prices. </p> <p>We asked about arrears and repossessions. In most cases they are beginning to rise - and could present a major problem over the coming year. </p> <p>Finally, we sought reassurance on solvency, levels of free capital and exposure to toxic instruments that have destroyed the balance sheets of so many banks.</p> <p>Our conclusion? This is a sector that is, for the most part, in remarkably good health. In particular, the smaller societies are virtually untouched by the credit crisis and can teach their banking counterparts - and Gordon Brown - a thing or two about prudence. LTVs are, in some cases, remarkably low, while arrears are in places almost invisible. </p> <p>But at the bigger societies, the picture is less comforting. They are far from replicating the business model of Northern Rock, but nonetheless many still rely on high amounts of wholesale funding. Read on for our full results.</p> <p><strong>Wholesale funding</strong> A building society is banned by law from raising more than 50% of its funding from the wholesale markets. </p> <p>On demutualisation, that rule is lifted, which is how many former societies were able to grow their lending rapidly. Northern Rock's wholesale figure was 75% before it collapsed, Bradford &amp; Bingley was about 50% while HBOS was just under 50%.</p> <p>The good news is that no society is anywhere near the 50% limit. The highest we found was the Britannia, at 34%, just a shade ahead of a group of biggish societies including Skipton at 32.8%, Chelsea (31%) Nationwide (31%) Leeds (29.9%), Norwich &amp; Peterborough (29.5%) and West Bromwich (28.3%). Some have reined these figures back markedly in recent months. West Brom, for example (a society which expanded rapidly in buy-to-let) gave us unaudited figures for the end of September. In their last report and accounts in March, its wholesale funding requirement was 38%.</p> <p>It's worth noting that many of the societies that have high levels of wholesale funding are also the ones that appear in the savings \"best buy\" tables, offering the highest interest rates to lure in cash.</p> <p>But don't read that as a cause for undue concern; remember, these funding rates are substantially below the levels that caused problems for the banks. Britannia says the figures are easily mis-read, as it has money coming from customers of its offshore arm which is treated as \"wholesale\" for accounting purposes. At the other end of the scale, we found some small societies with zero demand for wholesale cash - such as the Melton Mowbray, the Beverley, the Swansea, and the Holmesdale.</p> <p><strong>Average loan to value</strong> This was the big surprise - we all know how 95%-plus lending exploded in the years running up to the credit crunch. Yet most building societies told us their typical LTV across their book of mortgages was in the 40%-50% region. One, the Market Harborough, has a staggering 27.2%. </p> <p>This is partly because the societies \"index\"' their LTVs to house prices. So if they grant a 90% mortgage, and house prices rise 100%, the LTV on the books falls to 45%. But what it does suggest is that the societies were more prudent than the banks in their high-percentage lending, and have a big cushion to rely upon as house prices fall. Many societies, especially the smaller ones, also told us they had never sanctioned lending much above 70-80% and even over the past year, kept below 60%.</p> <p><strong>Arrears and repossessions</strong> More good news from the societies - although we were puzzled at how the vast majority told us they were \"below industry average\" when, logically, they can't all be. But it will comfort savers at societies such as Cumberland to find that the total arrears rate is just 0.0019%. Beverley has just six customers who have fallen behind on payments to the tune of \u00a320,000 - peanuts compared to its \u00a3145m in assets. Many had no properties in repossession at all. Perhaps these are early days before job losses start to hit, but the societies' arrears are still fantastically reassuring.</p> <p><strong>Solvency ratio and subprime exposure</strong> We would like to have given the societies \"star\" ratings or exam-style gradings. Unfortunately, we can't. The \"solvency ratio\" figures we obtained were very closely bunched, with most around 13% or 16%, depending on arcane calculations around a set of rules called 'Basel I,' which has recently been superseded by 'Basel II'.</p> <p>So we asked, instead, how the societies have \"stress tested\" their financial position. What if house prices collapse? What if joblessness soars, and customers default on their mortgages? How soon will they go bust?</p> <p>We found that the Financial Services Authority is, in private, asking the same questions. Every society has been forced to test its mortgage book in a series of worst-case scenarios, where house prices plummet and repossessions rise above even the level of the crash of the early 1990s. The smaller societies promise us they are virtually destruction-proof. For example, Saffron's chief executive, Andy Golding, says he has tested his mortgage book far in excess of the FSA demands, and it still survives. </p> <p>\"Stress testing is agreed in a format with the FSA and we do some layering above that. We apply a 40% degradation in house prices across the UK and 55% in Greater London. We then look at the credit profile of our borrowers, and their propensity to keep paying, with figures for defaults in excess of anything in the early 90s. Even after that, we remain standing. We would use up a lot of our capital, but we would still survive. And I have to add that we do not envisage house prices falling anything like 55%.\" </p> <p>Giant Nationwide, (its assets add up to more than all the other building societies put together), has gone through the same sort of stress testing, and says it, too, has sufficient capital to survive. </p> <p><strong>So is your money safe in a building society? </strong>Yes, is the answer. Nothing in our survey suggests any society is, for now, about to collapse in the way the banks have. The mutual model has weathered the financial storm far, far better than the stock market model. Building society bosses don't chase short-term profits to boost their stock options, as they don't have any. As the government mulls long-term solutions for the likes of Northern Rock, it may now want to consider remutualisation rather than returning it to a private sector that has proved so irresponsible. </p> <p>But this is no time for complacency. Cheshire is being taken over after a fateful loan to a property developer, while Derbyshire took a wrong turn into sub-prime and buy-to-let. They won't be the last societies to disappear.</p> <h2>Nationwide: 'Our size, strength and status place us in a unique position'</h2> <p><strong>Nationwide Building Society</strong><br><strong>Size </strong>The largest<strong>,</strong> with \u00a3179bn in assets<br><strong>Wholesale funding</strong> 31% <br><strong>Average loan to value</strong> total mortgage book 41%, new lending (at April 4 2008) 59% <br><strong>Arrears and repossessions</strong> Greater than three months 0.36% - less than a third of the 1.21% UK lender average. Nationwide says: \"Some 400 residential properties were taken into possession during the 2007-08, a tiny number considering we have 1.4 million mortgage customers\"<br><strong>Solvency ratio</strong> 12.4% (Basel II)<br><strong>Subprime exposure</strong> 0.05%</p> <p><strong>Message to members</strong> \"Nationwide is a strong and well-funded organisation with a robust and well capitalised balance sheet. Nationwide is in a much stronger position than any organisation that is heavily dependent on the wholesale markets for funding. Customers' money is safe with Nationwide. Our size, strength and mutual status place us in a unique position to be able to provide a secure and trusted home for people's savings. We have managed our business prudently and will continue to do so. The society is not under any capital pressure and has a high quality balance sheet.\"</p> <p>As well as sponsoring England's football team, Nationwide is, by a huge margin, Britain's largest building society. </p> <p>It is also the second largest deposit taker in the UK, so its financial health is vital to all of us. </p> <p>This week it was the only mutual among the eight big lenders in the government bailout package. </p> <p>Should that give savers any cause for concern? After all, isn't it a rather similar business to Halifax, which has had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB? </p> <p>Nationwide board director Tony Prestedge told Guardian Money: \"We are a fundamentally different business. You could compare us to Halifax, but it is also a commercial bank, and it was HBOS where the issues existed. Our reliance on wholesale funding is between 29% and 31%, whereas HBOS was close to 50%. We were never exposed in that big a sense.\" </p> <p>So why is it in the government's \u00a350bn rescue package? Prestedge says: \"There are banks included, such as HSBC, which have said they won't be drawing on the money. At our current levels of capital, we do not see a need to draw against it either. But it makes every sense for Nationwide to be part of the discussion when systemic solutions are required.\"</p> <p>Chief executive Graham Beale adds that the society has a robust \"tier one capital ratio\" of 9.7% coupled with a high quality balance sheet.</p> <p>Did it take on too much risky lending during the boom years? Between 2007 and 2008, it more than doubled exposure from \u00a36.5bn to \u00a314.1bn in the buy-to-let and self-certification markets through subsidiaries UCB Home Loans and The Mortgage Works. </p> <p>\"We do have exposure to such markets, but the proportion of our lending in this area was never huge, and remains less than 15% of our total,\" says Prestedge.</p> <p>Nationwide led the way in demanding higher homebuyer deposits, even though that caused a near halving of its market share. But it has not all been plain sailing. It has been exposed to \"toxic assets\" - derivatives which can be impossible to value accurately. Last year it wrote off \u00a3102.2m in securitised investment vehicles or SIVs.</p>",
  "<p>Most people remember their first day at school. Whether you were champing at the bit to put on your uniform and get into that playground, or were not so keen and had to be prised away from your mum's leg, it's usually a momentous day. Fast-forward some 15 years and you may be considering the prospect of another first day \u2014 your first day at work. </p> <p>Scary? Exciting? The beginning of life on a nine-to-five treadmill? Whichever way you look at it, wouldn't it be nice if you could skip the awkward first few weeks where you don't know anyone, don't know where you're going and don't know what you're supposed to be doing? For a lucky few this uncertainty is a thing of the past, as graduate employers are increasingly providing opportunities to interact with them before starting work. </p> <p>Known as \"keeping graduates warm\" the aim is to ensure new recruits are engaged from the moment they accept a job offer, so they can hit the ground running when they join. </p> <p>\"There are lots of strategies we have in place to keep our graduates warm,\" says Yvonne Crew, graduate recruitment manager at Centrica. \"It's all about helping graduates to make a really quick start, so we hold events like a summer coaching day, which gives them ideas about what they can be doing at home beforehand to get ready for the scheme. We look at time management and adapting to change, and afterwards the graduates feel better prepared.\" </p> <p>The realisation by employers that they can't just disappear for a few months after the completion of the application process has largely been driven by the increase in internship and summer placement schemes. Gradually it is becoming commonplace for students on these schemes to be offered graduate positions before they begin their final year at university and, sometimes, even before. This means that there can often be a long gap between acceptance of a job offer and beginning work. For students, this gap can be a time when they have lots of questions. For employers, it is a period when they can potentially lose their new recruit to another organisation, as Crew explains. </p> <p>\"Employers are starting to appreciate the value of internships and summer placement programmes in terms of getting the best people into their organisations early. We have a summer placement programme which involved 54 people this year and from it we are offering about 35 positions to students who are about to enter their final year. Unfortunately, even if students accept a job offer they may not always take it up and can look at other organisations in their final year. We don't want to lose them and our 'keeping warm' work helps ensure they stay with us.\" </p> <p>Katie Alloway, 23, is just the kind of graduate who has benefited from the strategy. The Durham University graduate joined Centrica a year after completing a summer placement scheme in 2006. </p> <p>\"From day one after accepting the job I felt part of the company and was given everything I needed to make sure I felt comfortable,\" Alloway says. <br>\"I had lots of questions about the company culture, what to expect in the first couple of days and what my line manager was going to be like. I received emails from the graduate recruitment team, phone calls from my new line manager and my graduate buddy. I also had access to a welcome website, which provided a lot of information on everything from finding accommodation to the experiences of previous graduate trainees.\" </p> <p>Having an online presence is an essential part of the \"keeping warm\" process. Many organisations, including BT and Deloitte, already have Facebook groups dedicated to their new graduate intakes, however, others are now taking this a step further. Centrica says it is working on a professional graduate networking site to be launched by the end of the year, but HSBC has already developed its graduate Green Room, which went live <br>last month. </p> <p>Richard Freeborn, graduate recruitment marketing manager at HSBC describes the site as \"a cross between an intranet and a professional version of Facebook\". HSBC makes job offers up to two years before graduation and sees the Green Room as the perfect way to keep the communication going between employer and employee in waiting. </p> <p>\"I think this is the first of its kind,\" says Freeborn. \"Lots of companies use Facebook to try to get graduates to meet each other, but this is actually building a distinct portal created especially for that purpose that they can use up to two years before they join the company. We have all the information about joining HSBC and the kind of things we expect from them in one place, as well as a network where they can find out who is joining the same time as them, who went to the same university and who has the same interests.\" </p> <p>Users will be able to create their own personal profile, check their first week's diary and find out more about their department. Podcasts and an instant chat facility are planned additions to the site in the future. </p> <p>Clare Burton started with HSBC in September 2007 after completing a law degree at the University of Sheffield. Burton was part of the group that developed the Green Room and says she would have benefited enormously had it been available when she was starting with the organisation. </p> <p>\"When you start with the bank you get a buddy, so you have someone to answer questions,\" Burton says. \" With the Green Room, you can now do that before you start. When you begin the programme you are placed in a branch so you are not part of the graduate community straight away. I was placed at the Kingston branch \u2014 if I had been able to find someone who had previously done a placement at Kingston it would have been an easier transition.\" </p> <p>Burton also notes that having the freedom to talk to a range of employees can help graduates to identify the right career path earlier. </p> <p>\"The scheme is set up so that your career could go in a number of ways. Talking to lots of other people about their experiences, and not just your buddy, can help you to work out which direction you want to go in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fifty-odd years ago today, at a Liverpool church f\u00eate, right after a display of police dog-handling, a myopic youngster in a check shirt sang \"Be-Bop-A-Lula\" amid \"the competitive clamour of craft- and homemade cake-stalls, games of hoop-la, quoits and shilling-in-a-bucket, children's cries, indifferent adult conversation, and birdsong\". It was the day John Lennon met Paul McCartney, and you've read about it before, but possibly not with this richness of background scenery. </p> <p>Philip Norman recognises only two \"full-scale\" Lennon studies before his: Albert Goldman's \"risibly ignorant\" hatchet-job, and Ray Coleman's \"honourable attempt\" which \"never quite brought John alive on the page\". The term \"full-scale\" is tricky, of course: Lennon's story has been retold in countless books. At 853 pages, Norman's tome is the most ambitious yet. His mind - and therefore his prose - is more sophisticated than Coleman's; where Coleman delivered banalities like \"beneath that abrasive exterior beat a heart of pure gold\", Norman shows perspicacity and literary flair. Books about pop musicians often read like strung-together magazine articles; The Life is a proper biography. </p> <p>Even so, Norman's doorstopper cannot hope to be as definitive as its title implies. The Beatles' significance far exceeds the scope of any one book. They epitomised - and to a remarkable degree created - the 1960s, an era which still eludes full understanding. Norman's coverage of the Beatlemania years is patchy, perhaps because he felt he'd said it all before in Shout, his 1981 biography of the group, or more likely because he knows he can provide only a pr\u00e9cis of a phenomenon that fills whole libraries. His dissection of Apple is nicely concise but lacks the period atmosphere of memoirs such as Richard DiLello's The Longest Cocktail Party. Anyone seeking understanding of Lennon's radical politics and peacenik escapades might be better served by Peter Doggett's There's a Riot Going On or Anthony Fawcett's One Day at a Time. Little attempt is made to analyse the music, as though Norman knows he can't compete with Ian MacDonald's masterful Revolution in the Head. Visually, The Life is weak. John Lennon's journey through a rapidly transmogrifying century was documented by thousands of images. Norman's book reproduces a mere 27 snaps, not all of them well-chosen. In this respect, at least, Coleman's generously illustrated offering was far superior. </p> <p>Despite its scholarly bulk, The Life does not cite sources. This conceals how few of Norman's own interviews underpin the important parts of the tale, and disguises the overwhelming extent to which The Life is a blend of previous writers' efforts. With Lennon and those who raised him all dead, his siblings, close friends and associates all authors in their own right, and the choicest bystanders interviewed multiple times, the only unexhausted territory is the distant margins. Norman combs these with great dedication, but is it really worth tracking down the life model at John's art school for an inconsequential chat? Reminiscences by casual girlfriends (\"John was the best kisser I ever met\") and erstwhile drinking pals (\"Betty would give John a blow-job behind the bar-counter\") are little more than gossip, and the speculation that John may have \"fantasised\" about gay sex with Paul is typical of the sort of tabloid food dye that gets injected into even the most nutritious biographical fare nowadays. </p> <p>Quibbles aside, The Life pulls together the essential material and organises it in smoothly readable fashion - a colossal task that Norman tackles without visible strain. The book is strongest on Lennon's childhood and adolescence, bringing postwar Liverpool to life and patiently nuancing John's muddled middle-class/working-class background. Norman synthesises the accounts of various family members who've challenged John's self-pitying conviction that he wasn't wanted; in truth, a small crowd of would-be parents wanted the boy. </p> <p>Spurred by John's pep-phrase \"To the toppermost of the poppermost!\", the Beatles ascended to surreal heights of fame. Relentless mass hysteria made them quit the concert circuit in the mid-60s, but by then their arena was inside people's hearts and minds. The foursome set about transforming the world musically and socially, at a speed that still beggars belief. And, no sooner had the magical mystery tour passed through Pepperland than John invited the public on an even more exotic trip: his avant-garde adventures with Yoko Ono. As the best-loved music group in history grew estranged, John and his Japanese soulmate embarked on a long, ingenious campaign for peace. Lennon proved a surprisingly eloquent, focused politician, and Quixotic though the mission was, its symbolic potency has endured. </p> <p>By contrast, Lennon's American years, from 1972 onwards, encompassed much that defies sympathetic spin. (Norman aims for a non-judgmental tone, a legacy, perhaps, of his early hopes - squashed at the 11th hour - that Ono might endorse the book.) John's best potentials seemed to go awol, leaving too few compensations for drunken boorishness, narcissism, craven insecurity and sloth. The Life devotes many pages to the intricate legal strategies of Lennon's fight against deportation, never daring to suggest that John's artistic and spiritual health might have improved if he'd been booted out. When May Pang, John's mistress and PA, began to inhibit his incessant womanising, he moaned: \"I don't know how to get rid of her 'cause she's my phone book.\" It would be difficult to pack more unpleasant qualities into one remark or imagine an attitude more at odds with the sentiments of \"Imagine\", but few public figures betrayed the ideals of the 60s more flagrantly than John and Yoko while pretending to uphold them. By the late 70s, a heroin-addicted Ono was working nine to five at a gold-inlaid desk to increase the working class hero's fortune. Renoirs, Egyptian tomb treasures, prize dairy cows and refrigerated storerooms full of fur coats were just a few of the empire's spoils. One day, when an old friend from Liverpool commented \"Imagine no possessions, John\", Lennon retorted: \"It's only a bloody song.\"</p> <p>All through his childhood and early life, John declared that he would be a millionaire and must never, ever work. In this sense, his final half-decade of artistic inactivity, much of it spent dozing in front of a giant TV in a luxury penthouse staffed by servants including \"one man whose sole job was keeping the brass doorknobs bright\", was his dream come true. But, to give him credit, he was an enthusiastic father to his second son, lavishing on Sean all the love and nurture he'd found so difficult to bestow on others. (Norman ignores reports that John's \"househusband\" image was a sham and that most of the hands-on parenting was done by nannies.) The book's concluding chapter is a sweet, fuzzy interview with Sean, thus relieving Norman of any obligation to sum up or evaluate \"the life\". Indeed, the last half-dozen chapters are thin on insight, and leave much that's been written about the Dakota years unexamined. Whatever investigative zeal motivated him to interview every obscure Liverpudlian and Hamburger who had the slightest recollection of John, it's long gone by the end. But never mind, some future chronicler will no doubt fill in the holes.

  "<p>You know you've reached rock bottom when you find your house has been broken into and the burglar has left a note urging you to pull yourself together. This is how low middle-aged sales rep Tyndale Corbett has sunk since he lost his job with a firm selling lighting equipment. So he decides his marketing skills might be put to better use selling salvation, and takes a flight to Miami, where he soon finds work as an assistant pastor at the Church of the Heavily Armed Christ.</p> <p>This is the kind of thing that happens in Tibor Fischer novels. The most recent, Voyage to the End of the Room, featured an agoraphobic who gets a job in a Barcelona strip joint; before that we had The Thought Gang, in which a British philosopher teams up with a one-armed French convict and goes on a bank-robbing spree. There are few authors as capable of pursuing an improbable caper to its most outlandish extremes. Yet this latest leaves you wondering if Fischer's novels aren't a bit like gum: briefly refreshing rather than nourishing; and though there's the odd philosophical speculation to chew on, they inevitably lose their flavour after a while. </p> <p>Fischer's problem is basically the same as his hero's - he simply doesn't know when to stop. Having inveigled himself into a position of authority with a crackpot church whose congregation could fit comfortably into a car, Tyndale begins to get grand ideas. Since posing as a pastor has been so easy, he decides to aim higher and attempt to pass himself off as God. \"A tall order but what a potential pay day. Considering my failure as a human being, what have I to lose by acting worshippable?\"</p> <p>Well, the confidence of the reader for a start. Even the most outrageous satires need to be tethered to some form of truth, but once Fischer unleashes his imagination it simply floats away. \"Strolling down Collins Avenue I abjure reason and jettison honesty,\" Tyndale says. \"It's fantastic. I resolve to laugh at qualities such as reliability, compassion, punctuality, patience, industry and the truth.\" This is all very well, except that it conveniently grants the author licence to disown plausibility and consistency at the same time.</p> <p>Fischer seems unable to prevent himself from suffocating a promising comic idea by pushing it too far. In one scene Tyndale makes a delivery to a nightclub (he combines his pastoral duties with a little drug couriering on the side), where \"in the DJ booth a small monkey was changing the discs with practised ease\". Closer inspection reveals that the monkey is armed. You can suspend incredulity only so far. A monkey in a nightclub is just about believable; a monkey operating the turntables is stretching it a bit; but a monkey with a gun is really only there to set up the inquiry \"does the monkey have a licence for that?\" and the inevitable punchline, \"It's a monkey, it doesn't need a fucking licence\". A few pages later the monkey tears a page from the Bible and rolls itself a spliff, having now become a comic device that has so outlived its useful purpose you want to borrow its gun and shoot it.</p> <p>Such anarchy would be fine if it shed some revealing light on the vicissitudes of religion, or people's willingness to buy salvation from a cynical charlatan. Yet the insight Fischer provides is neither particularly profound nor original. He speculates on the nature of miracles, suggesting that they may not have to be on the loaves-and-fishes scale to have a life-altering effect. He backs this up with a childhood story about his dread of being punished for allowing an ice-cream to melt in his jacket pocket, followed by jubilation when he arrives home to find all traces of the stain gone. It's a neat anecdote, but seems incredibly close to the pivotal scene of Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club, in which the young hero prays for a pair of swimming trunks so he will not have to appear naked in front of his classmates, and pledges a lifelong devotion to God when a pair miraculously appears in his locker.</p> <p>Early in the novel Tyndale contemplates killing himself, but rejects it because \"suicide panders to our laziness, and laziness always wins, sooner or later. That's the only law.\" A couple of hundred pages later he repeats himself, stating: \"the only law is laziness always wins.\" Such repetition sums up the facile nature of the book. There's a sprinkling of good ideas and some flashes of pithy comic writing; but it is laziness that wins in the end.</p>",
  "<h2>How can I rein in a senior manager who is resistant to change?</h2> <p><strong>I have been appointed as a consultant charged with implementing a change programme in a local authority. One of the senior managers is against the programme and is bad-mouthing both me and the programme to his subordinates. I have approached him directly on the matter on a couple of occasions to discuss this and thought I had resolved the problem. However, I have discovered that he is still behaving as before. His boss, the chief executive, authorised the programme. What should I do next?</strong></p> <p>A lot of people in a lot of organisations have two strong antipathies: any suggestion of change and all outside consultants. It's your ill-fortune to represent both.</p> <p>Those who resist change are not all Luddites. It's a dismally familiar experience to be promised the benefits of change - and then to discover that the old way was better, the updated software is so sophisticated that it's incomprehensible and the new reporting lines make decision-making a nightmare. Many people's instinctive suspicion of change is well founded.</p> <p>Managements, too, often omit to consult, inform, explain and involve. Convinced as they've become themselves of the need for change, they think it will be so self-evidently beneficial that it can simply be imposed. Staff suspicions, entirely understandably, are immediately heightened. Ignorance breeds rumour, rumour breeds fear and fear breeds blind resistance. </p> <p>Add to all this the widespread belief that all consultants are overpaid and have no instinctive feel for any particular organisation. They recommend a jargon-ridden, one-size-fits-all solution to a mesmerised management, pocket their fees - and then disappear over the horizon, never to live with the consequences that they've so lucratively created. That, at least, is the word in the canteen.</p> <p>So faced with the problem of your truculent senior manager, and given this background, I doubt if further direct approaches to him will help you much. Nor will going to the chief executive and complaining.</p> <p>Instead, I suggest you draw up a simple and workable communications plan, in writing, and then ask for a meeting with the chief executive. Explain that the programme of change he authorised will be implemented very much more smoothly - and therefore more quickly and more economically - if he, the chief executive, is seen to involve all members of staff, from senior managers down, in a systematic communications programme. Details of the proposals and the thinking behind them need to be explained to all staff. Open meetings need to be held - small enough for individuals not to feel intimidated so that they're able to ask questions and raise objections. Senior managers need to be there to take those questions and reassure. If the changes are to be fully understood and accepted, it's essential that they're seen to be at the instigation of the organisation itself - and not just the whim of some academic consultant. At no point should you identify the one senior manager who's been causing you so much grief.</p> <p>If he's serious about these changes, your chief executive will accept these recommendations; and if he does, your troublesome senior manager, though probably remaining inwardly resistant, will be effectively silenced. It's worth adding that if a sensible communications plan had been introduced at the beginning, you'd have been spared this whole unpleasantness.</p> <h2>Married couple in their 50s seek one last work challenge - but what?</h2> <p><strong>My husband and I both have the same problem. We're in our early 50s, both arts graduates who have \"gone with the flow\" over the last 25 years. Neither of us had a plan. He is a carpenter/builder and I run a small market stall and do a bit of teaching. We like our jobs and like being our own bosses. However, with about 10 years of working life left to us, we think it would be nice to do something that really excited us for those years, something we felt passionate about. We don't really have anything in mind. We have many interests and enthusiasms but we're cautious by nature. Is there anywhere we could get some advice or guidance?</strong></p> <p>Type \"career advice\" into a search engine. Because it's a broad category, you'll be faced with a daunting 1.5m items. But with a little perseverance and luck, you'll be able to track down sites that concentrate on enthusiasms and passions rather than standard careers. If nothing else, an hour or two spent this way will get your imaginations stimulated and your repertoire of possibilities greatly enlarged.</p> <p>The fact that you're both cautious by nature, however, suggests to me that you're unlikely to becoming excited by any way of life with which you're totally unfamiliar. If true, this is probably lucky; it will protect you from extremes of expectation - only to be followed later by disillusionment.</p> <p>My strong instinct - based, I admit, on the flimsiest of evidence - is that what you're really searching for is not a new and all-absorbing interest but a new and demanding focus for one or more of your existing interests. </p> <p>As you say yourself, for the last 25 years you've both gone with the flow. You've jogged along contentedly, enjoying your freedoms. What's missing, I suspect, is some sort of seriously challenging target.</p> <p>I'm not suggesting that you should suddenly become nakedly ambitious: just that you should, jointly, set yourselves a tangible objective - a project - and quite a demanding one at that. </p> <p>I'm in no position to know what it should be but I'm pretty certain it should spring from work with which you're already familiar. Is there a need for a special needs school? Does some admirable local amenity need re-funding and refurbishing? I mention these two only because they would call on your established skills and experience.</p> <p>If you can identify such a project, then you should commit yourself to it - and openly. Nothing stiffens the resolve like the knowledge that any form of failure will be painfully public.</p> <p>It will, ideally, draw on both your own and your husband's skills more or less equally. Once agreed and announced, preferably with some fairly precise timescale attached, you'll find that all your emotions are heightened. There'll be greater pressure, yes; but also a far greater sense of purpose. Rather than hoping to discover some brand new interest, I suspect that committing yourselves to such a project could provide exactly the sort of additional excitement that you and your husband are hoping to find. </p> <p>\u2022 For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"http://work@theguardian.com.\">work@theguardian.com.</a> Please note that Jeremy is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or reply personally. </p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy's book, Another Bad Day At The Office?, is published by Penguin at \u00a36.99.

  "<p>Another leopard crosses my path through the woods of Sandy Warren, its lean, muscular body slinking through the grass. A night prowler, it still stalks the Warren early on these damp mornings when the trees are shaking last night's rain from their leaves. This one, stumbled upon at the foot of the hill, is darker than those I have seen further up the slope. Even so, it has the characteristic potato-print pattern that gives this animal its name. Or rather the first part of its name - the second element sends many people hurrying on in disgust. For this is a leopard slug.</p> <p>Pulling out a hand lens, I drop to my knees and go eye-to-tentacle with the beast. The slender left stalk stretches up and my view is filled with the tip, the black eyespot in the centre looking like a frog's egg in spawn. This creature's vision only really extends to distinguishing between light and dark and so, in a moment of curiosity, it has been drawn by light glinting on glass. Down below, two smaller tentacles have a ramshorn curl. These are the food detectors, scenting fungi, lichens and rotting plants.</p> <p>But right now nothing stops the slug's fluid momentum. The frill-edged foot beneath flows over a fallen twig, and now the lens passes behind the head to the leopardskin shoulder - a smooth plate called the mantle that conceals the slug's vital organs, both his and hers. The chocolate blotches on a pinkish-grey background gain their sheen from a gelatinous film that coats the slug's body. Here, the translucent coating is etched with delicate lines like wave imprints on wet sand.</p> <p>The slug's back glides into view. From high above, contrasting bold stripes run its length, the animal's body tapering to a point. But close up, the lines are obliterated by a deeply corrugated surface. A minute later the tail has gone past the eyepiece and I am examining the slug's trail. Clear, shining sheets of mucus are hung out taut between blades of grass as far as the lens can see; a beautiful, gleaming track.</p>",
  "<h2>Citigroup admits defeat in battle for Wachovia</h2> <p>The struggle for control of the troubled US bank Wachovia has been won by the San Francisco-based Wells Fargo after Citigroup abandoned an attempt to seal a deal. Wells Fargo offered $11.7bn (\u00a36.8bn) for Wachovia last week, trumping an offer by Citigroup. Still smarting at being gazumped, Citigroup said it would sue Wells Fargo for breach of contract, seeking $60bn in damages, but eventually conceded that a deal was out of reach. \"Our shareholders have been unjustly and illegally deprived of the opportunity the transaction created,\" Citigroup claimed in a statement.<br><strong>Andrew Clark in New York</strong></p> <h2>Absolut vodka firm sues rebranded Virgin Radio</h2> <p>The owner of the Swedish vodka brand Absolut has launched legal proceedings against Absolute Radio, the rebranded Virgin Radio, for infringement of its trademark.

It claims that consumers are likely to be confused and that Absolute Radio could be detrimental to its vodka brand.

  "<p>\"Converted\" by my late husband in 1953, I have been a pretty obsessive Guardian reader for more than 50 of my 90 years. Each day the Quick crossword demands early solution. Then, between chores, I read the news pages before finishing off G2, although I skip the celebrity and fashion stories. Often the supplements follow, particularly Media and Society, while Saturday's Review section is a special treat.</p> <p>Having a background in magazine journalism, I particularly enjoy the high standard of writing, especially in some of the comment and feature articles, as well as the editorials. The letters page is a constant source of instruction and entertainment - to which I have contributed the occasional snippet - while the whole ethos of the paper appeals strongly to me.</p> <p>I started out in 1942, writing for and helping to edit the Geographical Journal in Ottawa - very enjoyable. But in 1946, with only $50 in my pocket, I took the boat to London. I was lucky to find stopgap employment in the City in a freezing cold basement room. Because of an acute paper shortage, we (slave labour, in coats and mittens) spent our days churning out cracker fillers - small crossword puzzles, jokes etc. Occasionally we pirated US comics, translating the dialogue into RAF slang and printing on brown paper.</p> <p>Then, miraculously, I was offered a job with the English Geographical Magazine to produce a series of illustrated articles on castles in western Europe. It was blissful. </p> <p>In 1953 I got married and took up a short-term contract to cover the coronation of Elizabeth II for the weekly magazine Illustrated, rival to the better-known Picture Post. Following that, I settled near Manchester and reluctantly abandoned journalism after the arrival of my two sons.</p>",
  "<p>Harlem's Holcombe Rucker Memorial Park isn't the prettiest of locations. Yet for 44-year-old Buddhist Beastie Boy, turned documentary-maker, Adam \"MCA\" Yauch, the asphalt rectangle in Manhattan is just perfect.</p> <p>\"It's the Mecca of basketball,\" explains the gravel-throated New Yorker. It's here that in Yauch's new documentary, Gunnin' For That #1 Spot, that America's top 24 NBA-bound high school ballers do battle against each other, before endorsement contracts render them all media-trained and inaccessible. Set up by high school sports magazine Rise in 2006, the \"Elite 24\" competition would, thought Yauch's friend associate editor, Kris Stone, be an event worth documenting on film.</p> <p>\"I thought that, if these guys did succeed,\" Yauch explains, \"it would be cool to see them early on. You won't ever get that access to see them that age again.\"</p> <p>Gunnin' follows them first in class, at home and on the court, before shooting their arrival in New York and their game at the Rucker. It's a deft sports movie with a great soundtrack, a deadpan portrait of talent on the verge of greatness, and a fine addition to Adam's body of work.</p> <p>Yauch directed the majority of the Beastie Boys' music videos and put together the band's 2006 live movie, Awesome, I Fuckin' Shot That! He's the oldest, most politically aware of member of the rapping trio. While Mike D was launching clothing labels and Adam Horowitz was courting Hollywood starlets, Yauch went to find himself in Tibet, returning to campaign for the country's independence.</p> <p>Yauch now oversees his own recording studio and film distribution business, Oscilloscope Laboratories. The likes of Bad Brains and MIA have graced Oscilloscope's recording booths, while Gunnin' aside, Oscilloscope Pictures plans to distribute Flow, a documentary about the coming water crisis, and Frontrunners, about high school elections.</p> <p>Though mainly a sports film, Gunnin' isn't without political nuance. The director selected players not only for their skill, but also because of their varied backgrounds. \"They were different,\" he says, \"financially, racially, geographically.\"</p> <p>There's Baltimore's Donte Greene, whose rundown neighbourhood could have easily served as a backdrop for The Wire. Then there's Oregon's Kevin Love, nephew of the Beach Boys' Mike Love and son of former NBA forward, Stan Love. Local hero, Lance Stephenson, from Coney Island, NY, is all the more remarkable, when you consider that he was only 16 when the film was shot.</p> <p>\"These kids travel around, live in different cities and play for different coaches, it's a strange world. On one level they're ordinary, on another they're have a whole crew of people around them, positioning them.\"</p> <p>While the players in Gunnin' were ineligible for sponsorship when the game was shot, four of the eight featured joined the NBA in 2008. At one point, the game's commentator, fellow hip-hop and basketball fanatic, Bobbito Garcia, jokes that they're watching two teams of future millionaires.</p> <p>\"But I don't even think he's joking,\" says Adam. \"If they do well, they could be offered $50m contracts from Nike.\"</p> <p>After all this real-life drama, Yauch himself is keen to direct a narrative next, yet he's on a tight schedule, not least with Beasties-related plans. The band are getting ready to go back into the studio, while there are plans to cut a movie to accompany the instrumental BBs album The Mix-Up, as well as a vocal version.</p> <p>\"I don't know what's going to get finished,\" Adam admits. </p> <p>\"There was a project of other people doing remixes; MIA worked on one, and Snoop Dogg did one and Jarvis Cocker did one. If we get enough we'll put them out as an album, and if we don't we'll put them out as singles.\"</p> <p>There was a time when this kind of multi-tasking would have been beyond Yauch and co. These days, however, he knows how to keep a number of balls in the air.</p>",
  "<p>Sri Lanka's two-Test tour of England next year will not take place, its country's board said yesterday, after Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) finalised a proposal that will commit the future of its international players to the Indian Premier League at the expense of Test cricket.</p> <p>\"The series is definitely off, since it has not yet been ratified by the ECB and still remains subject to approval,\" said an SLC official of its status with the England and Wales Cricket Board. \"So, there is absolutely no chance they are going to sanction a series against a Sri Lanka A side.\"</p> <p>SLC has always suggested that its star players would be unavailable for the tour of England because of their IPL commitments and the announcement not only confirms that but suggests that the IPL will be the board's top priority for the next decade.</p> <p>In place of next summer's Test series against England SLC has offered the ECB a three-match one-day international series to be played around May 25.</p> <p>Sri Lanka's sports minister, Gamini Lokuge, is understood to be the man driving through a deal with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). In return for committing its centrally contracted players to play in the IPL and the Champions League for the next 10 years, SLC would receive $70m (\u00a341m) from the BCCI. The BCCI has also offered to include Sri Lanka in two tri-series in 2009 and 2010 as an extra financial incentive.</p> <p>The Sri Lankan Cricketers' Association last discussed a deal with Lalit Modi, the chairman of the IPL, two weeks ago. The proposal has not been ratified but representatives of both parties will meet to discuss the fine print a week tomorrow. It is believed that the deal would permit Sri Lanka's Test tour of England in 2010, which is scheduled to clash with the IPL, to take place.</p>",
  "<p>If England reach next summer's European Championship it is difficult to believe Stuart Pearce's side will face a more demanding test in the tournament than the one Wales provided last night. Gabriel Agbonlahor's 62nd-minute backheel means England start Tuesday night's second leg at Villa Park in command but no one in Pearce's squad will be taking progress to Sweden for granted after Wales produced a performance full of conviction.</p> <p>Pearce had insisted there would be no complacency but Wales's dominance early on suggested England had underestimated their opponents. Not until after the interval did Pearce's players begin to control proceedings and even then it seemed that it was the visitors' strength and stamina, rather than any aesthetic qualities, which swung the pendulum back in their favour. It was, all the same, a wonderful piece of skill from Agbonlahor which divided the teams.</p> <p>Brian Flynn, the Wales manager, was entitled to feel aggrieved that a foul went unpunished in the build-up, Tom Huddlestone appearing to raise his boot in a challenge with Rhoys Wiggins before Mark Noble scampered clear. What followed could only be admired, however, as Agbonlahor brilliantly steered Noble's cross beyond Owain Fon Williams to nudge England ahead.</p> <p>Relief was the overriding emotion in the England camp after a pulsating encounter in which there was little evidence of the huge disparity in experience between the two sides. \"The tie is not dead. Some of the words said in the dressing room will leave the players in no doubt we have got work to do,\" said Pearce, whose starting XI all belonged to Premier League clubs, compared with only two players in the Wales side. \"We have had a big wake-up call tonight.\"</p> <p>The alarm bells were ringing before Wales took the lead as Flynn's side started with such confidence that England barely touched the ball in the opening 15 minutes. Indeed there was no surprise when the breakthrough arrived, Simon Church confidently scoring the first of his two goals after Michael Mancienne's clearance ricocheted off Steven Taylor and into the part of the striker. </p> <p>It was an unnecessary goal and the same could be said for England's equaliser five minutes later. David Wheater climbed highest to head James Milner's corner towards the bottom corner but Wiggins should have cleared on the goalline. Ten minutes before half-time Pearce's side went ahead when Adam Johnson cut inside Neal Ardley and curled a sublime shot inside the far post. Wales were on the back foot for the first time but their response was impressive as the irrepressible Aaron Ramsey released Church to shoot past Joe Hart. </p> <p>The interval provided an opportunity to pause for breath before England seized the initiative when Agbonlahor, who had controversially gone missing before the European Championship two years ago, proved he is at least capable of arriving in the six-yard box on time. </p> <p>\"I was hoping the headline would be 'Our prayers are answered by Church',\" said Flynn. \"But we are capable of scoring twice at Villa Park.\" That much is clear.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's team yesterday delivered a pre-emptive strike against the Troopergate investigation into Sarah Palin's alleged abuse of power in Alaska that could prove to be a costly distraction from his campaign.</p> <p>With only weeks left until the election and trailing badly, McCain's team sought to minimise potential damage from the investigation due to be published last night by issuing a report of its own. The row is over an allegation that Palin, as governor of Alaska, sacked the head of the Alaskan police force, Walt Monegan, because he refused to dismiss her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, Mike Wooten.</p> <p>McCain's dossier, setting out Palin's version of events, claims the sacking was over disagreements about policy and budget, not Wooten. It portrays the sacking as \"a straightforward personnel decision\" that has become \"muddied with innuendo, rumour and partisan politics\".</p> <p>The McCain dossier says Wooten is a separate issue and goes on to say that the Palin family has good reason to be concerned about him. It accuses Wooten, who was involved in a messy divorce from Palin's younger sister, of having \"a long history of unstable and erratic behaviour\".</p> <p>The row has the potential to swamp media coverage of the campaign over the weekend, eating into valuable time for McCain as he tries to turn round his campaign. It again raises questions about his judgment in choosing a running-mate who had an investigation hanging over her. </p> <p>The McCain team's dossier comes after the failure of its repeated attempts to have publication of the official investigation delayed until after the election on November 4.</p> <p>The investigation was ordered by the Alaska senate 10 weeks ago. Palin refused to cooperate with the investigation, after initially saying in public she would. The McCain dossier dismisses the senate inquiry as a \"politically driven\". It adds: \"The Palins make no apologies for wanting to protect their family and wanting to bring attention to the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge.\" </p> <p>A McCain spokesman, Taylor Griffin, who distributed the campaign's dossier, said it was based on public files and an affidavit by Palin's husband, Todd. The dossier says that Sarah Palin had been clashing with Monegan since October last year over policy, in particular budgetary issues. He refused the offer of an alternative job and was sacked, the dossier says. </p> <p>It blames the linking of Monegan's sacking to the Wooten dispute on Andrew Halcro, a political rival of Palin. The paper says Halcro met Wooten for drinks over three and a half hours at a bar in Anchorage and, afterwards, Halcro became the first person to link Monegan and Wooten.</p> <p>The dossier runs over claims about Wooten that have already been made public, including that he killed a moose illegally, used a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson and threatened to kill a member of the Palin family. It says: \"Understandably concerned about a pattern of behaviour demonstrated by someone entrusted with the responsibilities of law enforcement, the Palin family reported the behaviour to the appropriate authorities.\"</p> <p>The Palins' complaints about Wooten were investigated by the police. Some were upheld but were regarded as relatively minor, reflected in the police decision in 2006 to allow him to keep his job after a short suspension, later cut in half.</p> <p>With Obama building up significant poll leads all week as a result of the public anxiety over the economic crisis, McCain could do with a weekend free to concentrate on attacking his rival rather than having to deal with Troopergate.</p> <p>The Arizona senator, who was campaigning in Wisconsin yesterday, sought to exploit links between Obama and Bill Ayers, one of the founders of the Weathermen, a radical group responsible for a wave of bombings in the 1970s.</p> <p>Palin originally made an issue of the link last weekend but McCain has now taken up the theme, accusing Obama of bad judgment. His team, sensing a vulnerability, put out an ad yesterday about the relationship between Obama and Ayers, who met in Chicago before Obama became a national figure.</p> <p>Obama, campaigning in Ohio, a key swing state, urged McCain and Palin to stop using negative tactics. \"It's not hard to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division,\" Obama said. </p> <p>If the election were to be held today, polls suggest Obama would win by a landslide, but there are more than three weeks to go and the gap could still narrow. A poll published yesterday gave Obama an 8% lead over McCain in Florida, which was pivotal for the Republicans in 2000 and held by them again in 2004. </p> <p>McCain is resting much of his election hopes on taking Pennsylvania from the Democrats, but polls over the last few days give Obama double-digit leads, including one of 13%. </p> <p>The third of the big three swing states, Ohio, is tighter but Obama has leads of 4-6% in four polls and McCain ahead by 1% in another.</p>",
  "<p>Reports that Washington and Pyongyang may be on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7662686.stm\">brink of a deal</a> to formally delist North Korea as a state sponsor of terror in return for a revised nuclear verification accord have raised international hopes for conflict resolution in north-east Asia and the restarting of the stalled six-party talks.</p> <p>The key catalyst for this breakthrough appears to be have been the tireless, peripatetic diplomacy of Christopher Hill, America's assistant secretary of state for east Asian affairs, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/nuclear.usa\">visited Pyongyang</a> from October 1 to 3 for reportedly \"substantive\" discussions with his North Korean counterpart. </p> <p>Underpinning Hill's efforts have been an understandable sense of urgency at signs of political instability in North Korea \u2013 prompted in part by widely reported <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iO8uXzn9oeFIsgDoE8dq5lDFnA0QD93MDR280\">claims</a> that Kim Jong-il, the North's leader, has been seriously incapacitated since mid-August by a debilitating, possible fatal stroke.</p> <p>Added to this have been the efforts of the North Korean leadership to pursue, in time-honoured fashion, its familiar pattern of diplomatic brinkmanship \u2013 first by restarting its mothballed Yongbyon nuclear reactor in mid-September, second by barring International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from visiting the Yongbyon facility, and most recently by the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Rest_of_World/North_Korea_fires_short-range_missiles/articleshow/3572383.cms\">launching</a> of two short-range missiles in the Yellow Sea to the west of the Korean peninsula, while threatening to follow up these tests with a further 10 missile launches.</p> <p>However destabilising and provocative the North's actions may appear to the international community, judged from Pyongyang's perspective the logic of the North's position seems unassailable. To the North Koreans, the Bush administration's attempt in June to add additional detailed verification requirements to stage two of the nuclear disablement agreement appeared to be a breach of an earlier agreement.</p> <p>Recent press reports that the US and South Korean militaries have been dusting off contingency plans \u2013 most notably <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oplan-5029.htm\">OPLAN 5029</a> \u2013 for an armed conflict on the Korean peninsula have also contributed to a growing sense of distrust between Pyongyang and Washington, undermining much of the confidence-building that has been achieved since early 2007.</p> <p>The terms of Hill's Pyongyang accord remain hazy, but background reports suggest that the US envoy has proposed a lowering of the bar on some of the key verification requirements, limiting inspections to the North's plutonium facilities, leaving out of the equation for now the contentious issue of the North's highly enriched uranium program and wider proliferation concerns, and limiting the number of undeclared facilities that would have to be open to inspection. The proposed plan also may provide a key inspection role for Chinese officials, allaying in the process North Korean fears that US officials would use the cover of inspection to conduct espionage in the North.</p> <p>For now, the Bush administration, in the form of the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and it seems the president himself, appear keen to pursue this negotiated solution. If it holds, it will be sure to attract the strident criticism of hawks such as the former ambassador John Bolton as well as congressional opponents who will label the deal as a sell-out.</p> <p>Yet removing the \"state sponsor of terror\" label will, in principle, provide North Korea with access to vital international financial support and the sort of material incentive that can arguably deliver real and lasting progress in securing a peaceful outcome to the nuclear standoff. </p> <p>However, Washington's problems are not confined to critics at home. Already, the new conservative government of Taro Aso in Japan has signalled its opposition to the deal and has already moved today to renew for a further six months tough economic sanctions against North Korea. </p> <p>As with past critical stages in the nuclear talks, coordination between the different members of the six-party talks is essential, and once again the process appears to be at risk of foundering. Senior diplomats from the US, Japan and South Korea are due to meet next week in Washington for high-level talks on regional security cooperation, opening the door for a resolution of such differences, but the time frame for securing such an accord is perilously tight.</p> <p>South Korean military reports have suggested that the North may be close to developing the capability to deploy a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile and some have speculated that Pyongyang may be considering a second nuclear test, to mark the anniversary of its first test in October 2006. Such a development would almost certainly scupper the six-party talks, perhaps irretrievably. To hawks such as Bolton, who have often made the case for regime change or at the very least regime collapse, this would arguably be no bad thing.</p> <p>The problem with this position is that it represents wishful thinking and an exaggerated belief in the fragility of the North Korean government. Even allowing for the reports of the illness of Kim Jong-il, seasoned observers of the North Korean polity point to the likely stability of a future collective leadership, while recent field reports from South Korean NGOs predict a much improved harvest for North Korea in November and a sharp easing in the North's food shortage crisis \u2013 pointing to a further dampening of internal pressures.</p> <p>History demonstrates clearly that North Korea is nothing if not resilient. It also suggests, as demonstrated by the first nuclear crisis of the mid-1990s, that careful negotiation and close alliance coordination are the best ingredients for conflict avoidance.</p> <p>Imperfect as the current accord may be in delivering full and comprehensive verification, it represents an important step forward. Let us hope that wise counsel and the hard work of seasoned diplomats such as Hill and others may be allowed to prevail and to sustain the momentum of the current critical round of talks with North Korea.</p>",

Facebook has had \"a little bit of a process rolling this out\" because they want to address the privacy concerns.</p> <p>\u2022 The most successful apps have been those that really engage users and pick on recent and relevant activity. That's the best way to highlight the information. Apps that are just a box that sits on your profile have seen a decrease in use. \"We want apps with ongoing sharing, the stuff that gets surfaced in feeds ad apps that produce engagement.\"</p> <p>\u2022 He thinks the growth of sharing information and content is exponential. Over time, people have become more comfortable with sharing more and more information about themselves and that will continue. \"A large part of your identity is who you are connected to...\"</p> <p><br><em>Photograph: <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/briansolis/2321406429/\">b_d_solis</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en_GB\">Some rights reserved</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 Why isn't <strong>Facebook Connect</strong> more open? At the moment, developers have to build for two different systems. \"The feedback we get from developers is that people prefer our interfaces. We have more developers building on our part of the stack than on top of the others,\" he said. \"We're moving in that direction and are physically aligned to it, but think our platform is more mature than the others. The user experience is nicer with Connect.\" He said even the best open systems started closed: \"The <strong>Windows</strong> operating system supported more hardware than Apple but it would have been difficult to build a market before there was a market created by closed systems. Our job is to stay on the right side of trends and that's the way we believe we have to go.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Facebook now has 700 employees and 100 million users; how does he deal with that stress? \"I don't go home that often. My apartment for a while was just a mattress on the floor - now I have a boxspring.\" He retold a <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> interview where the <strong>Apple</strong> chief executive had been asked for advice for entrepreneurs. He said that you have to love what you do, or it would be irrational to spend so much energy doing it. \"People ask why we haven't sold the company but we didn't build the company to sell it. It goes back to caring what you do and focusing on that.\" He made the transition from development to management by building a good team around him but still dabbles with bug fixing from time to time.</p> <p>\u2022 Facebook currently employs a lot of people on operations, looking after the 10,000 machines that run the site. Cloud computing can't scale for companies this large yet, but Zuckerberg said it's an important technology for startups.</p> <p>\u2022 It's important that Facebook defines itself as a technology company and not a media company, like other Silicon Valley firms. Senior management, even those in non-tech roles, mostly have an engineering or computing background. Is that about credibility. \"Credibility is external - DNA is internal. The CFO might have a technical background but it helps him make better decisions,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 Facebook will eventually release APIs for messages, photos, address books - everything. But they aren't rushing it. The redesign was about supporting the growth of sharing (the UK alone shared 100m photos per month) and recognising that activity switching to mobile. That doesn't explain why it's so hard to find stuff now on the site... but giving these kind of figures is a good indication to startups of the volume of content on the site and the most fertile parts of the site to build apps around.</p> <p>\u2022 The economy: is now a good time to be building web apps? \"I don't think it's a bad time,\" said Zuckerberg, in a very well rehearsed response. \"If there's a major recession it will impact everyone but traditionally some of the best companies have been built in down economic times. I've tried to keep people at Facebook focused on companies that have succeeded in providing clear value. If you offer value to end users then that lasts.\"</p> <p>Guardian.co.uk is a silver partner of Future of Web Apps</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kazakhstan\">Kazakhstan</a> manager, Bernd Storck, has warned his players they will not play for the national team again if he catches them exchanging shirts with their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England</a> counterparts after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">World Cup qualifying</a> tie between the sides at Wembley. </p> <p>Despite the 117 places that separate the two in the Fifa world rankings, Storck wants his team to treat the match as a genuine chance to prove their worth and not as an excuse to collect valuable memorabilia. \"If my players try and change shirts straight after the game they will get in big trouble with me,\" said the German, who is taking charge of Kazakhstan for the first time. \"This is not an important thing for them to do, if they really want England shirts I will buy some for them. They must concentrate on the game instead \u2014 the first player to change shirts with [David] Beckham or [Wayne] Rooney never plays for the national team again.\"</p> <p>Storck's bullishness is undermined somewhat by the form of his side going into what will be the former Soviet nation's first meeting with England. Kazakhstan have lost their last two qualifying matches; 3-0 to Croatia and, most recently, 3-1 at home to Ukraine, a sequence of defeats that has left them second from bottom in Group Six and resulted in Arno Pijpers losing his job as manager in September after only 20 months in charge.</p> <p>Storck replaced him on a one-match trial basis and, having previously been in charge of the Kazakhstan Under-21 side, he has brought a host of young, untried players into the squad at the expense of 17 more experienced members who were ditched following the defeat to Ukraine in Almaty. Four debutants will start at Wembley and Storck insists this is their chance to stake a claim for further call-ups.</p> <p>\"The players have nothing to lose against a big team like England,\" he said, agreeing the encounter will be the biggest in Kazakhstan's 14-year footballing history. \"They must play with confidence and without fear, and I hope when they come in the stadium they are happy to play there. They may not get a chance to do so again. We want to play in a forward and aggressive manner, be in good control in defence but then attack when we have the chance. I am not worried about the result, only that we play good football.\"</p> <p>The former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund\">Borussia Dortmund</a> player, who is also currently in charge of FC Almaty, admits this will be difficult against an England side that is brimming with confidence after their 4-1 win in Croatia last month \u2014 no one more so than Theo Walcott following his hat-trick in Zagreb. But despite the danger posed by the Arsenal forward, Storck insists he will not be making any special arrangements for him. \"It's not only about Walcott, we must also stop the player who passes him the ball. England have many other very big names,\" said the 45-year-old. \"I have never seen an England team as good as the one that played in Croatia. But all we can do is try our hardest and play as a team.\"</p> <p>As well as worrying about England, Storck also has to concern himself with the constant references to the comic character Borat, which are made every time Kazakhstan is mentioned in this country. Indeed a man dressed up as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sachabaroncohen\">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>'s factious Kazak resident was seen outside Wembley prior to Storke's pre-match press briefing. \"The Borat thing is nonsense,\" said the national team manager. \"Kazakhstan is a very big country, a very serious county, with nice people, his [Borat] character is not like them. For me this match is a chance to make more supporters interested in football in Kazakhstan as at the moment it is only a small part of life there. I hope people will wake up after [the] match and come to our stadium.\"</p>",
  "<p>Are we about to return to something akin to the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_2546000/2546045.stm\">Cod War</a> of the 1970s? It might seem so from Gordon Brown's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/banking-creditcrunch\">declaration</a> last night that he is prepared to use the terrorism laws against Iceland, not to catch its fish but to seize the assets its companies have in Britain. Now it is true that with the collapse of Iceland's banking system, Britain's local councils, fire authorities, police services, charities and goodness knows who else are facing the loss of millions of pounds which had been invested (at the time, it probably seemed, rather judiciously) in high yield accounts. But Iceland's premier <a href=\"http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/minister/cv\">Geir Haarde</a> is no Nordic Osama bin Laden, and bashing a country for messing up its economy is hardly on a par with the attack on the twin towers.</p> <p>The Treasury has acted to freeze Iceland's Landsbanki's estimated \u00a37bn of UK assets, in an order made under section 4 of the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/security/terrorism-and-the-law/anti-terrorism-crime-security-ac/\">Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001</a>, a piece of legislation hurriedly passed by an enervated parliament in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. This provision authorises an intervention of this sort if \"action to the detriment of the United Kingdom's economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken by a person or persons\", with a further requirement being that such persons (whether a government or individuals) be external to the United Kingdom. Clearly there is nothing here about any prior requirement to designate Iceland as a terrorist state. As its name suggests, however, the 2001 statute was about a lot more than terrorism, though it was the fear of imminent attack that set the tone for discussion of the whole measure, thereby helping to push through powers that might otherwise have proved unpalatably over-broad and draconian - section 4, for example.</p> <p>No doubt Haarde calmed down when all this was explained to him and he realised there was no immediate necessity to hide in one of his country's many deep caves (though he may have other reasons to do a runner, of course). But the whole episode is a reminder of just how perniciously broad ostensibly restrictive anti-terrorism laws can be, how quite different powers can be freeloaded through on their backs, how embedded in the law they can quickly become, and how unexpected can be their application. What will it be next: 42 days detention without charge for city bankers and various \"fat-cats\"? Now there's a novel way to get the public behind an unpopular government measure ...<br></p>",
  "<p>Chelsea have issued a high court claim for \u00a316m against the Norwegian club FC Lyn Oslo and their disgraced former chief executive, Morgan Andersen, over the controversial purchase of John Mikel Obi, though there seems little prospect of the Premier League club being able to recoup all the money they paid for the Nigeria midfielder.</p> <p>Mikel arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2006 in a complicated deal that saw some \u00a34m paid to Lyn Oslo and \u00a312m to Manchester United, who believed they had originally signed the player on professional terms. However, Andersen was convicted in an Oslo court earlier this year of forging contracts relating to Chelsea and Mikel, which enabled the Norwegian club to gain a slice of the player's transfer fee. Chelsea duly informed Lyn that the deal was based on a fraudulent misrepresentation that the player had an employment contract at the Oslo club and that they would seek full repayment.</p> <p>Chelsea have privately stressed that they are not attempting to put Lyn Oslo out of business, and it appears unlikely that the Norwegian club, currently mid-table in their domestic league, would have the funds to pay anything close to the \u00a316m compensation demanded. With that in mind, the two clubs are involved in \"positive discussions\" in a bid to reach some kind of compromise over the case, the pursuit of which has fast become a point of principal for the Premier League leaders.</p> <p>Although Chelsea are technically seeking the return of the entire fee, the most likely result will be an out-of-court settlement between the clubs, given their willingness to maintain dialogue. \"The claim is against FC Lyn Oslo and Morgan Andersen and follows the criminal conviction in Norway of Lyn's former chief executive officer,\" said a Chelsea spokesman. \"It is for the entire \u00a316m fee paid by Chelsea for the player as it is now clear, following Andersen's conviction, that the transfer was based on the fraudulent misrepresentation that Mikel had an employment contract with Lyn.</p> <p>\"Chelsea has written to Lyn to make clear that because the transfer was based on a fraudulent misrepresentation, now proven by a court of law, the settlement previously agreed is not binding. Chelsea is in contact with Lyn and looks forward to working positively with them to resolve the claim promptly. Chelsea would like to make clear that this legal action is against Lyn and Morgan Andersen.\"</p> <p>That reflects the reality that Manchester United, who declined to comment, are not involved in any way in Chelsea's pursuit of the money they paid two years ago. Indeed, Chelsea are not intending to involve their Premier League rivals in the high court case. However, this should prove the final twist in a saga that infuriated Sir Alex Ferguson who, along with United, had been convinced that Mikel was bound for Old Trafford rather than Stamford Bridge some two years ago.</p> <p>Mikel claimed to have signed a youth contract with Lyn in 2005 but, within a week, United announced they had agreed to sign him on professional terms at the end of the Norwegian season in January 2006. The player was even photographed wearing a United shirt, only for Chelsea also to claim to have reached an agreement to sign the player. That prompted United and Lyn to report the London club and the player's agents, John Shittu and Rune Hauge, to Fifa and it was not until June 2006, some 14 months after the saga first flared up, that Chelsea agreed a compromise deal to pay both Lyn and United for the player's services.</p> <p>That decision was made on the basis that Mikel was under contract in Oslo, the reality of which was dispelled when Andersen \u2014 the chief executive at the Norwegian club at the time \u2014 was convicted of making false accusations and fraud over the agreement that apparently existed between his club and the midfielder. He was given a one-year suspended sentence after a court decided the professional contract Mikel subsequently denied ever signing and which committed him to the club actually carried a signature cut out from the amateur agreement to which he had previously been tied.</p>",

  "<p>In these <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business\">tumultuous times</a>, it is essential that we spend some time reflecting on why the global economy is in crisis. Without reflection, a blame game develops that can only lead to bad judgment, the wrong response, and an endless cycle of repeating our mistakes.</p> <p>What is generally agreed is that at the core of the problem is a banking system in which bankers were incentivised on the amount of credit they extended, rather than on any judgment of the quality of the loans they were creating. But the problem does not begin with greed, and the solution is not a lecture on morality. Instead solutions have to begin with a recognition that our current regulatory system was devised in the 1980s for entirely ideological reasons.</p> <p>In the UK, we have used a variety of methods to limit the amount of money that banks can create. In the 19th century, we used gold, and for most of the post-war period until the 1970s there were direct controls on lending. Increasingly, in the face of offshore and globalised money markets, these methods became less effective, but rather than adjusting the control mechanisms we chose instead to abandon all control.</p> <p>From 1979 to 1986, we persistently and continuously deregulated the financial sector. There were to be no reserve requirements, no limits over the use of wholesale markets, and no differentiation between a building society and a bank. Credit which had previously been rationed was to be freed. If an individual wanted to borrow money, then there was to be no limit over what they could borrow, especially and most importantly, because the new Britain was to be a property-owning democracy. This was the way to solve all the economic problems of the 1970s. Ownership would make us all more enterprising.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this led to a huge expansion of the money supply, and a credit-fuelled property boom that caused the recession of the early 1990s. At the time the Bank of England, in its quarterly publications, made it very clear that they understood that ending credit rationing had created an inflationary boom. Nigel Lawson's <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2000/speech82.htm\">mea culpa</a> in his 1992 memoirs attests to his understanding of the dangers of a free-for-all in money.</p> <p>But for some reason, these experiences were soon forgotten. Inflation targeting, which first began in 1993, was cemented by Gordon Brown's <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/framework.htm\">2% target</a> focused only on a small basket of consumer items. As such, it immediately opened up the possibility for the Bank of England to claim for itself great success while totally ignoring the huge increases in money supply in this country that were fuelling a housing price inflationary boom. Inflation targeting showed absolutely no regard to the real issue: the banking sector's ability to create as much credit-money as it liked.</p> <p>The 2% target was a nonsense from the start. We can hardly blame the high street banks when the Bank of England claimed it was doing such a good job, knowing full well from experience what happens when credit is over-extended. Instead, it relied for its prestige on hitting a target that has proved entirely ineffective in maintaining economic stability.</p> <p>New Labour had chosen to continue Thatcherism's work. It also believed that encouraging home ownership was part of its governmental duty. Monetary policy continued to be geared towards the freedom to borrow and to own. Failure to buy now, choosing to save instead, became a financial disaster. The fear of losing out required participation in the property game. Banks were simply playing their role in a political project that thought encouraging desire to own was a great thing, and they were convinced by eminent men, like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/books/18leonhardt.html\">Alan Greenspan</a>, that risks were so well dispersed by the genius of modern mathematical economics, that there was no cause for concern. The bankers themselves did not understand the maths, but someone, somewhere apparently did.</p> <p>So this is where the blame game needs to end. Not with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/banking-executivesalaries\">greedy bankers</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/iceland-gordonbrown\">Icelanders</a>, the 'short sellers', or with <a href=\"http://www.opec.org/home/\">Opec</a>. Neither is this just about financial contagion from the US. Our banks were every bit as over-extended as theirs. Knowledge of our recent history is enough to tell us that giving banks the freedom to lend with no restrictions will cause problems and playing ideological games with money is highly dangerous, as the 1990s recession aptly demonstrated. The fact that the Bank of England knew this, and it is written all too clearly in our recent economic history makes it all the more disgraceful that we are here again.</p>",
  "<p>As the godfather of prudence, Gordon Brown still has an enviable reputation \u2013 even amid current turmoils \u2013 for taking the long view of things. Yet, not for the first time, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4916344.ece\">his article in the Times</a> this morning suggests the often overlooked overhasty side to his character. </p> <p>\"We must lead the world to financial stability,\" says the headline to his article. OK, those are the Times headline writers' words not Brown's \u2013 you won't find them in the actual text. Yet as good headlines often do, these words accurately encapsulate the tone of the piece. The article is full of self-congratulation about the way the British government has responded to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">banking crisis</a> and about how it is a model for a possible global initiative of the sort that George Bush may promote this weekend in Washington. But such self-congraulation is surely premature \u2013 especially as the equity markets have gone on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">sliding so steeply around the world today</a>. If you were wanting to make a cheap point you might say that the government that banned short-selling on the markets is guilty of short-selling in politics.</p> <p>The times are too serious to make too many cheap points. But the plain political fact is that Gordon Brown has form when it comes to inflating his achievements. He also has form when it comes to posing as the Great Leader not just of his own grateful people but sometimes even of the whole world. Demands of the sort he made in the Times this morning calling for coordinated international action to solve common problems are a Brown political stock-in-trade. But they are rarely matched by a record of serious international achievement to go with it.</p> <p>If Brown succeeds in helping to craft a successful global governance response to the effects of the international credit crunch, then that will be a very great achievement indeed and I will be at the front of the line congratulating him. But please note two important words in the previous sentence. The first is \"helping\" \u2013 because in a highly diversified and volatile global economy, it is absurd for any one leader or government, even the United States, to lay down the law for all to follow. The world is more complicated than that. It depends on a give or take that is currently in fairly short supply among national governments (look at the EU's difficulties, look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/banking-creditcrunch\">Iceland</a>). So claims to British leadership and vanguard roles are simply hubris.</p> <p>The second important word is \"successful\". We don't actually know if the much-vaunted British bank rescue package this week has worked. It may do so in time, but it is not working yet. It is a longterm project \u2013 a bulb that has just been planted in the soil without having yet had any time to grow. Brown should not claim the credit for the package until it has been proved one way or the other. The claim to be leading the world to financial stability is even more specious and unproven. There isn't even a global plan in place yet, let alone a plan that is proving that it works. Once again, Brown is grabbing at the glory long before there is glory to be shared out. It is demeaning.</p> <p>Of course, if the British plan works in the domestic market and if the British play a role in getting something workable underway in global markets then these would be great \u2013 even historic \u2013 achievements. But we are nowhere near being able to say whether either of things is the case. Claiming credit for things before they have had time to work is not just stupid. It may also be reckless. If things go belly-up then the claims of mastery look even more absurd. That is, after all, pretty much what has happened to Brown's record as chancellor. He overclaimed and has been proved wrong by events. Given Labour's position in the polls and Brown's long run of unpopularity, you can see why Brown must be tempted to exploit good news. But he would be much wiser to hold off, add patience to prudence, make fewer false claims and secure more real successes before grandstanding in this way.</p>",
  "<p>The teenager accused of shooting Rhys Jones admitted to a friend that he had killed the schoolboy, a court heard today.</p> <p>The 11-year-old was gunned down in a pub car park on his way home from football practice in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, in August last year.</p> <p>It is claimed he was hit by a stray bullet fired by Sean Mercer, 18, intended for members of a rival gang.</p> <p>A 16-year-old defendant, known as Boy M, told police that Mercer had arrived at his house after the shooting and admitted to the killing. </p> <p>According to Boy M, his grandmother had answered the door to Mercer, who told her he had just shot someone and that \"a kid had gone down\". </p> <p>Prosecutor Neil Flewitt told Liverpool Crown Court that Boy M - charged with three counts of assisting an offender \u2013 had admitted most of what was alleged against him. </p> <p>He also told police the bicycle allegedly used by Mercer during the killing was collected from his house after the killing.</p> <p>Flewitt said the satin silver Specialized Hardrock mountain bike, which was found dumped the day after the killing and handed to police six months later following an appeal, can be linked directly to Mercer. </p> <p>The jury heard that Leslie Shimmin, a Liverpool resident, saw the bike on the news and in the local paper and realised he had found the bike frame the day after Rhys's murder. He found it while cycling with his sons less than 250 yards from an industrial unit allegedly visited by Mercer and his co-accused hours after Rhys's murder. </p> <p>Flewitt went on to explain that an insurance company had supplied Mercer with a Specialized Hardrock mountain bike in April last year after his previous bike had been stolen.<br> The serial number of the bike matched the serial number of the silver Specialized Hardrock mountain bike found by Shimmin and DNA swabs taken from the alleged murderer matched DNA on the discovered bicycle, he added. </p> <p>Flewitt said the facts provided \"compelling evidence\" that Mercer was the person who shot Rhys. </p> <p>Earlier today, the jury also heard that the gun allegedly used to kill the schoolboy Rhys Jones replicated the distinctive wounds inflicted in his shooting when fired in tests.</p> <p>According to the prosecution, the bullet - which entered Rhys's back slightly above his left shoulder blade and exited through the front right side of his neck - produced a noticeable \"keyhole effect\" on Rhys's body instead of a neat entry wound.</p> <p>Quoting the scientist who conducted the tests, Flewitt said the resulting wound was consistent with the bullet hitting the 11-year-old \"partially or fully sideways-on\" instead of nose-first.</p> <p>Neil Flewitt QC said a similar wound was created in tests on the .455 Smith and Wesson believed to have been involved in the shooting, using three of the .45 Colt cartridges recovered with the weapon.</p> <p>\"His tests revealed that the bullets produced the same distinctive 'keyhole' effect that he [the scientist] had identified on Rhys Jones's football shirt,\" Flewitt said.</p> <p>He said the unusual wound was the result of the bullet \"tumbling nose-over-base\" in flight rather than flying nose first in a stabilised manner.</p> <p>A bullet tumbling in this way is usually due to an undersized bullet or one discharged from a gun with a smooth-bore barrel or from a barrel with worn rifling. It could also be caused by deflection if the bullet passed through an intermediary target.</p> <p>According to the scientist, the tumbling bullet that killed Rhys was undersized by 0.08mm and the rifling of the revolver was worn.</p>",
  "<p>The white beams sliced through the Paris night, cloaking the north face of the 210 metre (689 ft) Tour Montparnasse, accompanied by a matrix of speakers shooting out a penetrating geometric pattern of sine waves of varying frequencies. </p> <p>Dressed in a padded black, fur-trimmed anorak, Ryoji Ikeda surveyed his work, Spectra (Paris) - 64 floodlights set out on an 8 by 8 grid at intervals of 2m - and smiled. Observers passing through the beams of sound and light heard the sine waves alter according to how they moved. Some used hand mirrors to \"throw\" the searchlights onto neighbouring buildings; this being Paris, others made out beneath the beams. People walking down the Rue de Rennes bumped into each other as they craned their necks to look at the spectacle enhanced by the flurries of insects, dust and rain drops dancing in the air </p> <p>\"The Tour Montparnasse has never looked so good,\" one long-term resident remarked, referring to the building's reputation as a blot on an otherwise stunning urban landscape. Ikeda had salvaged its reputation for one night at least, and as he himself put it \"it's only one night, but you'll never forget it\". Ikeda trained as an economist, but for the past 15 years has been Japan's leading contemporary composer. His project to transform the tower last weekend as part of Paris's Nuit Blanche contemporary arts festival, was, he said, \"the biggest experiment of my life\". </p> <p>It explored his long-term obsession with mathematics. The beams of light, (corresponding to a binary number) which though vertical appeared to disappear into a single vanishing point in the sky around 10 kilometres up, showed, he explained, the juxtaposition of the beautiful and the sublime. <br>\"Beauty is crystal, rationality, precision, simplicity \u2026 The sublime is infinity: infinitesimal, immense, indescribable. Mathematics is beauty in its purest form,\" he said. </p> <p>At the same time as his beams were lighting up the Parisian skyline, across the city the fruits of his flirtation with mathematics were coming together at Le Laboratoire, a less visible but arguably even more ambitious undertaking. Here Ikeda has been able to continue his experiments, in a space that takes the concept of artistic experimentation to an extreme and challenges the theory that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/sep/02/darwinscanopy \">art and science do not mix</a>. Housed in a former printing press and film studio on Rue du Bouloi, between the Louvre and Grand Palais, Le Laboratoire is a unique, innovative and not-for-profit space where artists and scientists are invited to collaborate on projects. </p> <p>Its founder is David Edwards, formerly a biotech researcher and chemical engineer, and now professor of Harvard who made a name for himself through his groundbreaking research on drug delivery and needle-less vaccines. He has channelled his well-earned millions into numerous humanitarian projects. Le Laboratoire, funded from his own pocket as well as private sponsors, is his latest baby, with which he wants to explore the fusion between the creative processes of art and science. \"It's like living at an intersection, and as far as we know, it's unique,\" Edwards, a novelist as well, whose own world appropriately straddles both fields, described it in loving terms as \"the home I will never be asked to leave.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338447989\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/09/la460.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Le Laboratoire, Paris.

Photograph: Bruno Cogez</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno Cogez/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edwards insists the creative process of artists and scientists is similar, which is why he wants to encourage them to move into each others' fields or laboratories. It's a concept that he admits is potentially controversial and not without risk, not least because it's a challenge from which many artists and scientists would run a mile. </p> <p>\"This interface of cultures is traditionally bloody. But from personal experience I can say moving from one lab to another is incredibly refreshing, and rejuvenating and I think on the high-performing level artists and scientists understand each other very well, and want to understand each other even better. Of course as you move down the competence scale that readiness is less evident - we all find comfort and security in saying: 'I don't need or want to understand something'. But at Le Laboratoire we're only interested in doing projects at the cutting edge,\" he said. In short, if artists and scientists conversed more freely, he believes we would gain a better understanding of our world. </p> <p>Ryoji Ikeda and the Harvard professor and number theorist Benedict Gross are two of the first to have signed up to Edwards' brave new world. He invited them round to dinner one night to talk about mathematics. The conversation spun around the topics of orders of infinity, fractional dimension and most specifically, the controversial mathematical theory \"V is not equal to L\". The result of those in-depth conversations - which developed over a year - are several works by 42-year-old Ikeda who was commissioned for the official opening of the institute to be unveiled tomorrow.</p> <p>Central to Ikeda's artworks are two horizontal panels, one a prime number consisting of over 7.23 million digits, the second a random number generated by computer algorithms, also consisting of over 7m digits. From anything but extremely close up, the panels are fuzzy concrete-grey prints. Close up the viewer becomes mesmerised by the mass of 0.8mm-high digits, which are daunting in their vastness and precision, but hint at a common aesthetic language shared by art and maths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338447967\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/09/la346033.jpg\" alt=\"Ryoji Ikeda, V=/L, Commissioned and produced by Le Laboratoire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Number crunching ...

Photograph: Marc Domage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Domage/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Benedict and I argued about it a lot,\" Ikeda explained. \"The random number for him is nothing, because it has no point mathematically, whereas the prime number is like a jewel, a diamond, because it can be reduced to a more compact form, or expanded. Whereas for me the random number is exciting because it does exist mathematically, and we can't know for sure if it's truly random.\" Gross, who also studied the violin, described his meetings with Ikeda as inspiring and a way of releasing some of the \"funny tension\" which exists between science and art. \"He forced me to think about these questions in a way that I never went about before. In some sense he's exploring as an artist exactly the same questions that we are desperately trying to understand as mathematicians and where he's at the border of his art and we're at the border of our mathematics, there's a lot of intersection \u2026 I think we're in a period where there's going to be more interactions between scientists and artists,\" he said. </p> <p>For Ikeda it was revealing to see what he had in common with the mathematician. \"We share many things, not least the obsession with beauty and truth and the way we express ourselves. They talk of beauty as something simple, short, compact, elegant, delicate and sexy, which is the same vocabulary as an artist uses. Neither of us can necessarily define what beauty is, but we can recognise it when we see it.\" There is the comfort zone which Edwards talks about, into which we can easily withdraw and say: \"I don't need to understand\". Le Laboratoire tries to nudge us away from it, by giving us an insight into a beauty we might not otherwise have realised existed. </p> <p>\u0095 The full inauguration of <a href=\"http://www.lelaboratoire.org \">Le Laboratoire</a> takes place on October 11 2008. <a href=\"http://www.ryojiikeda.com\">Ryoji Ikeda's V=/L</a> runs at Le Laboratoire from October 11 until January 12 2009, as part of Festival D'Automne.</p>",
  "<p>Stockmarkets around the world slumped today as fears of a global recession deepened. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/creditcrunch-shortselling\">Wall Street fell to a five-year low</a> last night, the rout started in Asia, where Singapore slid into recession, and quickly spread to Europe. In London, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">FTSE 100 plunged more than 10%</a> in early trading, and the Dow Jones dived nearly 700 points to 7882 shortly after Wall Street opened, a fall of 8%. Both markets later came off their lows, and the FTSE 100 closed almost 9% down and the Dow was seen off almost 2%.</p> <h2>Asia-Pacific</h2> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong><br>New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index fell 4.7%, its biggest one-day fall since October 24 1997, at the height of the Asian financial crisis. The index closed down 139 points at 2805, its worst performance in six consecutive days of declines. Over the past six trading days the market has shed 427 points, or 14%.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong><br>Australian market watchers called it Black Friday. In Sydney, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 plummeted 8.34%, or 360 points, to close at 3960, its biggest ever one-day percentage loss. Together with the 8.2% plunge on the broader All Ordinaries index, today's session wiped A$106bn (\u00a341bn) from the value of stocks. Nearly every stock fell.</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong><br>Tokyo's Nikkei plunged 9.6% to close at its worst week in history. It lost nearly a quarter of its value this week. The index tumbled 881 points to 8276, its lowest level since May 2003. It was the biggest one-day percentage fall since the stockmarket crash of October 1987. At one stage the Nikkei was down more than 11%, and the slump prompted the Tokyo bourse and the Osaka Securities Exchange to briefly suspend some futures and options trading.</p> <p>Yamato Life Insurance went bankrupt, the first major Japanese financial firm to collapse in the wake of the global credit crisis. Cash was king, with even Japanese government bonds being liquidated for funding. The Bank of Japan pumped \u00a54.5 trillion (\u00a326.97bn) into the money markets to ease liquidity. The yen, regarded as a safe-haven currency, jumped to a three-year high against the euro and a seven-year high against the pound.</p> <p><strong>South Korea</strong><br>The Seoul Composite index dropped 4.1% to 1241 points.</p> <p><strong>China</strong><br>The Shanghai Composite index fell 3.6% to 2000. China's central bank said it would make forceful efforts to boost domestic demand, and stressed the country's financial system was safe and stable. Analysts fear exports to the west will be hit hard.</p> <p><strong>Hong Kong</strong><br>The Hong Kong stockmarket closed on a three-year low. The benchmark Hang Seng index was down 1146 points, or 7.2%, to 14,796 after falling by more than 9.5% at one point. It is the first time the index has fallen below the 15,000-level since January 2006.</p> <p><strong>Singapore</strong><br>News that Singapore slid into recession for the first time since 2002 drove the Straits Times index lower by 162 points, or 7.7%, to 1940. The economy shrank 6.3% during the third quarter. Singapore's central bank responded by easing monetary policy for the first time in five years.</p> <p><strong>Taiwan</strong><br>Markets were closed for a national holiday.</p> <p><strong>Indonesia</strong><br>Share trading was suspended for a third day.</p> <p><strong>India </strong><br>India's central bank slashed its cash reserve requirement to free up some $12bn in funds and ease a squeeze that drove overnight rates in money markets to a 19-month high and forced the government to cancel a bond auction. The rupee hit an all-time low and the main stock index plunged more than 9%.</p> <p>India's finance minister said on TV that there was no need to worry about Indian bank deposits and investors should not panic. He said liquidity in the banking sector would improve once parliament gave the nod to providing more.</p> <h2>Middle East</h2> <p><strong>Israel</strong><br>The Tel Aviv stock exchange was shut for the Yom Kippur holiday.</p> <p><strong>Iraq</strong><br>The Baghdad stockmarket is booming, with the general index up by nearly 40% last month. Hotels and banks are among the hottest picks among the exchange's 95 listed companies, as violence has fallen to a four-year low. Saad Jalil, an investor, told Reuters: \"The world banking crisis won't affect us, our market is sealed off from the outside. We don't even have electronic trading.\" </p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p><strong>Egypt</strong><br>The Egyptian stockmarket fell 4.6% to 1993 points, after plunging 16.4% to a two-year low on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong><br>While much of the rest of the world is anxious about plunging stock markets, bank collapses and a looming recession, Zimbabweans would settle for any of that just to be able to find cash and to have it worth something in the face of an official inflation rate of 231 million percent. </p> <p>Independent economists say the real inflation rate is in the trillions, but such numbers have ceased to mean anything to most Zimbabweans, who are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of a few pence a day from their bank accounts because of a drastic shortage of cash notes, with the Zimbabwe dollar in freefall.<br> This week the government legalised the use of US dollars and rand in shops, formalising a part of the extensive foreign currency black market driven by the 3 million Zimbabweans who have left the country in search of work, mostly in South Africa. Everyone else is reduced to scraping by on near worthless salaries, bartering their furniture for food or growing their own to survive. </p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p><strong>Central Europe</strong><br>Russia, Romania and Ukraine suspended their stockmarkets today. The cost of insuring the sovereign debt of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other eastern European countries soared, pricing in a mounting risk of default. Emerging sovereign debt spreads widened over US treasuries to their widest levels since mid-2004.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong><br>The Kremlin admitted it was considering a Brown-style plan to ease Russia's dire banking problems. The Russian government will set up a special fund to buy \"quality\" assets from banks struggling with liquidity. Initially, Russia's central bank would pump in $15bn.</p> <p>Russia's twin leaders, meanwhile, have wasted little time in blaming the US. President Dmitry Medvedev this week memorably accused the US administration of \"economic egoism\". Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister, went further. During a meeting with Russian communists, he said the US's dominant role in economic matters was over. \"Confidence in the United States as the leader of the free world and the free market... has been undermined \u2013 for good \u2013 I think,\" Putin gleefully observed.</p> <p>At the same time, Russia has been keen to understate its own economic difficulties. Although regulators suspended trading again today on Russia's two main stockmarkets, TV news channels have been told not to use the words \"collapse\" or \"crisis\". Apparently there isn't one. There has been little mention on TV of the flight of foreign investors from Russia, or the fact that many Russian oligarchs are struggling to pay their dry cleaning bills.</p> <p><strong>Czech Republic</strong><br>Stocks in Prague fell more than 13%.</p> <p><strong>Hungary</strong><br>Shares in Budapest lost more than 12% and the Hungarian forint hit a two-year low.</p> <p><strong>Poland</strong><br>The Polish deputy finance minister, Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, said the fundamentals of Poland's economy were strong, and blamed the overnight decline of the Polish zloty on the slump in Hungary. The zloty hit an eight-month low.</p> <p><strong>Iceland</strong><br>There was no international trade of the Icelandic crown today after its banking sector, currency and economy crashed. Iceland says it has approached Russia for a loan to cover its banking liabilities, with analysts also speculating over a possible bail-out from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong><br>Share trading was briefly halted in Vienna this morning.</p> <p><strong>France</strong><br>The CAC-40 index in Paris dropped 7.7% to 3176. </p> <p><strong>Germany</strong><br>The Dax closed 7.1% down at 4541 points.</p> <p><strong>Sweden</strong><br>Sweden's stock exchange declared a \"fast market\" until further notice for cash trading and for the Nordic derivatives market. The bourse said a fast market is declared when a financial market is experiencing high volume and increased volatility. The move allows greater flexibility in some trading rules. Shares in Stockholm fell nearly 6% to 196 points this morning.</p> <p><strong>Italy</strong><br>Nearly half of Milan stocks were suspended after excessive losses. Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said the stockmarkets were in a grip of panic and fear, and expected consumption to fall due to fear. He said the government and the Bank of Italy had asked banks not to call in loans and to keep supporting industry. He also said European Union leaders may discuss the \"hypothesis\" of suspending markets temporarily while trying to resolve the global financial crisis.</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong><br>The Madrid stock exchange lost 8.7% to 973 points at the close. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is pushing for an urgent meeting of the 15 eurozone leaders. He asked French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, to call the meeting \"to define a strong, coordinated action among all the countries in the eurozone.\"</p> <p><strong>Switzerland</strong><br>The Swiss market dropped 4.75% to 5523 points.</p> <p><strong>UK</strong><br>A wave of panic selling wiped more than \u00a3100bn off the value of Britain's biggest companies. </p> <p>Dealers in the City dumped shares when trading began, sending the FTSE 100 plummeting by more than 10% in early trading. It closed 8.85% lower at 3932.1 \u2013 a 381.7 point fall, wiping about \u00a389.5bn off the value of Britain's biggest companies. This is the worst daily fall since the crash of 1987, beating Monday's 7.85% decline.</p> <p>Banks and miners led the fallers, along with blue chip firms such as British Airways and BT, as the wider economy was pulled into the deepening financial crisis.</p> <h2>America/South America</h2> <p><strong>United States</strong><br>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 700 points in the first ten minutes of trading to 7882, a fall of 8%.</p> <p><strong>Brazil</strong><br>Brazil's main stock index plummeted more than 10% in early trading. The Ibovespa index fell 10.2% to 33,303 in just the first half-hour after markets opened. Trading was then halted for 30 minutes because of a \"circuit breaker\" rule that kicks in when the Ibovespa loses 10%. Global financial turmoil has wiped out two years of stock market gains in Latin America's biggest economy. Brazil's currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the US dollar.</p> <p><strong>Venezuela</strong><br>President Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year's budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel. </p> <p>The finance minister, Ali Rodriguez, made an unfamiliar call for austerity in government departments. \"Spending on certain types of vehicles, mobile phones and parties will be eliminated,\" he said. </p> <p>Chavez said Venezuela's state-heavy economy was better positioned to weather the financial storm, a \"sinking of neoliberalism\" which he blamed on the International Monetary Fund. He hoped the crisis would prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan to create a \"Bank of the South\" to counter the Washington-dominated World Bank.</p> <p><strong>Cuba</strong><br>Cuba's isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. \"It was expected,\" the former president, Fidel Castro, noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma. </p> <p>Other pro-government commentators blamed the crisis on the US and said \"associates or tributaries of that empire\" were now suffering the consequences. They said the time had come for Latin America to form the pan-regional leftist front which Cuba and Venezuela have espoused.</p> <p>Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated agriculture and infrastructure. President Raul Castro has warned of food shortages and months, if not years, of painful rebuilding. This week, the government started to lease land to private farmers, a cautious but potentially important initiative to loosen communist control and reform the island's moribund agriculture.</p>",
  "<p>Same-sex couples in Connecticut need not be satisfied with civil unions and may marry, the state Supreme Court of Connecticut ruled in a just-released <a href=\"http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR289/289CR152.pdf\">decision</a>.</p> <p>Writing for the majority in the 4-3 decision, Justice Richard Palmer found:</p> <blockquote> <p>We conclude that, in light of the history of pernicious discrimination faced by gay men and lesbians, and because the institution of marriage carries with it a status and significance that the newly created classification of civil unions does not embody, the segregation of heterosexual and homosexual couples into separate institutions constitutes a cognizable harm. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><br><br>The case found in favour of eight same-sex couples who in 2004 were denied marriage licenses by officials in Madison, Connecticut. The couples sued, arguing the ban on same-sex marriage violates the state constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination (because a woman may not marry a woman, though a man may). They also argued the ban discriminates against gays, who are a separate class under state equal-protection law.</p> <p>The defendants, who included the state public health commissioner and the Madison town clerk, argued the same-sex couples had suffered no harm because the state's civil union statute affords them all the rights and privileges of heterosexual married couples. Also, \"The defendants contended that, in light of the universally understood definition of marriage as the union of a man <br>and a woman, the right that the plaintiffs were asserting, namely, the right to marry 'any person of one's choosing,' is not a fundamental right.\"</p> <p>In another election year, say 2004 or 2006, I would fear this would gain traction as a wedge issue for the Republicans, and we would see Republican candidates railing against \"activist judges\" and riling up social conservatives to drive them to the polls. But my sense this year is voters are far too focused on their dwindling retirement portfolios to care whether gays in Connecticut can marry instead of merely civilly uniting. Also, Connecticut is now the third state, after Massachusetts and California, to grant full marriage to same-sex couples. , so The right may by now have expended all of its demagoguing energy on those states and on the 2004 anti-gay marriage amendments in more conservative states.</p>",
  "<p>A funny thing has happened on the way to the forum. As the institutions of super-capitalism continue to implode, a number of conservative commentators have started to <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/162789\">lay blame for the mess on poor people</a>.</p> <p>Now that might seem strange given that poor people control approximately no major financial institutions. And it might seem unfair in light of the unprecedented redistribution of wealth away from the working and middle classes and toward the wealthy these past several years. According to <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/publications/411678.html\">the Urban Institute</a>, 60% of low-income families still don't own homes, despite years of the hard sell designed to get them to buy. More than a third of them don't own cars, which in many instances means they can't get jobs since they have no way of getting to work. Nine out of 10 of them have no retirement savings. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2008/03/05/richest-people-billionaires-billionaires08-cx_lk_0305billie_land.html\">Forbes</a> recently estimated that America's 499 billionaires (a number that has doubled in the past eight years) control $1.4tn in assets - or at least they did until the catastrophic market failures of the past month. </p> <p>It might even seem bizarre given the fact that millions of desperate men and women signed onto utterly manipulative, usurious, \"creative\" mortgages during the sub-prime gold-rush years, and, as a result, ended up losing what little capital they had accumulated over lifetimes of hard work as well as losing the roofs over their heads. To stretch a point, one could even view such a suggestion as offensive, since so many banks got into trouble by bundling mortgage securities that only preserved their value and generated profits so long as enough poor people signed on for the ride and agreed to be screwed.</p> <p>But, apparently, that's because you and I, dear readers, don't understand the intense psychological pull poor people have on rich folks, a pull that can, apparently, make the world's hardest, meanest and most ruthless CEOs - highly educated men and women who've spent years honing the fine arts of profit-making - part with good money on a whim and hand it over to a bunch of irresponsible, check-bouncing layabouts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200809190021\">Fox News's Neil Cavuto</a> went so far as to explicitly link banks' lending to minority customers - a move they only reluctantly agreed to after decades of redlining minority neighbourhoods and effectively removing most African-Americans from the home-ownership society - with the current financial collapse. Thursday night, on Larry King, a conservative spokeswoman accused the community organising group Acorn of \"pressuring\" banks to give mortgage loans to people with no jobs. Barack Obama is supported by Acorn. QED: the whole bloody mess is Obama's fault.</p> <p>Let's forget for a minute about the attempt to blame the collapsing global financial edifice on a man who in one breath the Republicans accuse of having no government experience and in the next try to position as being single-handedly responsible for the creation of trillions of dollars in dubious loans. Let's look at the deeper notion that manipulative poor people are responsible for all of our current pocket-ache.</p> <p>Earlier this year, researchers from <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/page2.cfm\">Demos</a>, the US think-tank of which I am a fellow, published a book on America's escalating personal debt crisis, entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Up-Our-Eyeballs-Hidden-America/dp/1595582118/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223616207&amp;sr=8-1\">Up to Our Eyeballs</a>. Among the findings: starting four or five years back, mortgage brokers were being paid by sub-prime lenders to trawl low-income and minority neighbourhoods looking for marks whom they could hang high-interest rate loans on. The brokers were paid \"yield spread premiums\" for getting borrowers to accept higher interest rate loans than the baseline rate the company would have been prepared to lend them money at. The loans were front-loaded with high fees and adorned with such small-print items as pre-payment penalties. Between 1994 and 2005, the authors found, \"sub-prime home loans increased from $35bn to $665bn.\" </p> <p>Many of these loans were given to people who in fact would have qualified for regular mortgages had they only known where to look and how to go about applying. Had they gotten those regular mortgages, they might not have faced personal ruin when their variable rates kicked in in 2007 and 2008. But then, again, had they got those mortgages, a whole lot of sub-prime middle-men wouldn't have gotten their profits.</p> <p>That unqualified borrowers were given huge loans is, at this point, a given. That these borrowers, en masse, are to blame for the resultant crisis makes no sense. Sure, some people took out huge mortgages they had no intention of paying off simply because they were selfish. But that's not the story experienced by most of the low-income borrowers. </p> <p>Let's get real here. People borrowed because they were presented with offers they couldn't refuse. They were told that home ownership was the path to prosperity, and, like everyone else, they wanted their chance to realise their dreams. When they held back from buying property, they found the decks stacked against them. The same people who urged deregulation of the mortgage industry also lobbied for an end to rent controls and curtailments of government-funded public housing. </p> <p>And for those who still held back, who risked ever-rising rents and ever-greater economic disempowerment, they were bombarded with pre-approval notices regarding mortgage applications from banks and finance companies who thought they could make a few quick bucks. They were repeatedly told, by financial specialists who ought to have known better, that buying, and then refinancing, their homes was a painless way to cushion their lifestyles. After all, the shills said, property values would inevitably keep soaring. And they were misled by brokers who didn't tell them what sub-prime loans really entailed. </p> <p>So I'll say it again: yes, many people made bad bets, didn't read the small print, didn't understand what they were getting into. But these are poor people, most of whom don't have the benefit of years of specialised higher education. When the times were good, conservatives were gleeful at the money liberated by lending to them at inflated rates of interest. How truly shameful that now that the chips are down they're asking the poor to shoulder the moral responsibility for the country's fiscal collapse. It's as stupid a notion as Marie Antoinette telling Paris's starving masses to eat cake when they could no longer afford their daily bread.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Gem Allen (aka Rockfoxx), Stacy Burton (aka Popfoxx), Lizzy Williams (aka Funkyfoxx). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> While the nation waits for Simon, Cheryl, Louis and Dannii, Pop TV's gang of four, to decide what this year's Christmas No 1 is going to be, here come Stonefoxx, a new girl group managed by Kiss 100 presenter James Merritt, who look and sound like X Factor entrants, no more, no less. There are three of them, and they've got aliases that sort of capture the blend of pop, rock and funk they're trying to achieve. Did we say blend? That sounds bland. A collision would be better, but we'll take what we can get. Mind you, forget the rock part; we're not sure what they were thinking there. Stonefoxx's relationship to rock reminds us of the one between Ghandi and guns \u2013 i.e. they don't have one. They're a pop-R&amp;B trio, and they shouldn't be ashamed of that. In fact, they should flaunt it. Girl-group pop-R&amp;B, especially the British variety, accounts for some of our favourite noises of the last 12 months. Sugababes' My Love is Pink? A ravishing rush of sound. Girls Aloud's Can't Speak French, Control of the Knife, Fling and new single The Promise? Sheer brilliance pours from every pore of those records.<br> Of course, the strength of those singles and album tracks lies as much in the songs themselves, the production, the arrangements, the performances of the musicians behind the scenes, as they do in the character of the girls in question and their voices. What can we possibly mean? We mean they're only as good as the people pulling the strings, doing the stuff behind the scenes. That's OK. We're not snobs, and we're not rock authenticists. Not all the time anyway. We don't really care who did what, as long as it sounds good. We acknowledge that the finished product is all.  Stonefoxx would appear right now to be half-finished. A work in progress. They're currently waiting to sign a record deal but they've already got a team of writers responsible for hits by Sugababes, All Saints, Jamelia and Kylie Minogue busily crafting and constructing music for them, including the likes of Shaznay Lewis and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. We'd like to biff him ourselves, to knock some pop sense into him, because he hasn't yet come up with a single memorable tune for the girls. Come Closer is an electro riff in search of a chorus, although their voices sound as pristine as you could want. We like the idea behind Crystal Clear but it doesn't have a hook. Cruel Goodbye and Hot Summer sound like Banaramama song titles all mixed up and in the wrong order, despite the enticing references in the latter to Olivia Newton John's Let's Get Physical and the Beach Boys' Good Vibrations. And Rewind is like a limp Spice Girls ballad. What We Do is probably their strongest \u2013 though most American - effort yet, sounding at best like something the Pussycat Dolls might place strategically halfway through their next album to sustain interest before you get to the next hit single. The schoolteacher in us says: the girls show promise, but they must try harder.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"A pure pop suga rush crossed with deep R&amp;B grooves. <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Stonefoxx have done their bit \u2013 they look the part, their voices synthetic-perfect \u2013 but they need to boot their collaborators up the backside. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> OD on Haribos after they read this. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> End Shaznay Lewis's run of bad luck. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Stonefoxx are currently deal-less. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Girls Aloud, Sugababes, Pussycat Dolls, Spice Girls. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/stonefoxxmusic\">www.myspace.com/stonefoxxmusic</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.stonefoxx.com/ \">www.stonefoxx.com/ </a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/stonefoxxvideos\">www.youtube.com/stonefoxxvideos</a> </p> <p><strong>Monday's new band:</strong> Les Gars. </p>",
  "<p>All customers of authorised financial services firms in the UK are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). It will pay compensation if a firm is unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against it - when this happens the firm falls into default. If a bank collapses and takes your savings with it you will be able to claim compensation from the scheme. </p> <h2>Reclaiming savings</h2> <p>If you have savings with a bank or building society that becomes insolvent, you can reclaim up to 100% of the first \u00a385,000 you hold in each provider with its own banking licence. You should check which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2008/sep/25/savings.providers\">banks and building societies share a licence</a>. </p> <p>You do not need to contact the institution yourself in order to make a claim. You will typically be required to complete a claims application form, which the FSCS will send you after the provider has gone into default. </p> <p>It is advisable that you send the form back as soon as you can - the FSCS aims to process all claims within six months after a declaration of default, although it may take longer depending on the complexity of the claim or whether or not there have been any delays with the liquidator.</p> <p>The FSCS normally issues a cheque for compensation, but says it will consider other alternatives for claimants who do not have a bank or building society account.</p> <h2>Making a claim against an insurer</h2> <p>When it comes to insurance, the FSCS will cover life insurance policies such as pensions, annuities and endowments, as well as motor, home and employers' liability insurance. For these claims you will again have to fill in an application form from the FSCS (not from your insurer) in order for it to consider your claim. </p> <p>If you are making a claim against an insurance company that has gone bust, the FSCS could compensate you for the premiums you have already paid (if the insurer is unable to do so) and will try and help you transfer policies or pay you compensation. </p> <p>Compensation is unlimited under the scheme, but you will not get all your money back unless it is a claim for a compulsory insurance, such as third-party motor cover. The scheme covers 100% of the first \u00a32,000 you have lost, plus 90% of the remainder of the claim.</p> <p>If you have specific questions or concerns about the details of your insurance policy rather than anything to do with compensation, you should speak directly to the insolvency practitioners who will be responsible for the administration of the insurer and the settlement of any claims. They should contact you to explain that your insurance provider has gone under.</p> <h2>Reclaiming investments</h2> <p>If you are making a claim against an investment company that has gone under, you will have to supply the FSCS with specific details about your investment, such as its type, how much you invested and when. If your business with the company was only ever before August 1988 then the FSCS will not be able to help you. </p> <p>The FSCS will usually ask you to send any documents relating to your investments which the company may have sent you. The more information you provide the smoother the claiming process may be.</p> <p>You can contact the FSCS on 020 7892 7300 or visit <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/\">www.fscs.org.u</a>k for more information.</p>",
  "<p>Direct-to-video. There's still a stigma attached to that phrase. Even updating it to the infectious sounding STD (Straight-to-DVD) or trying to make it sound Prince-style cool, D2V, haven't stuck, it's even more of a diss to say a film is heading for a format that doesn't even exist anymore. When the home video revolution hit, DTV releases were seen by many punters as a film that had somehow already failed. In the best case scenario, the film had stiffed so badly at the box office overseas that skipping a theatrical release was a last ditch attempt for the producers to cut their losses. Worst case? It couldn't even get a theatrical release anywhere in the world - not a good sign.</p> <p>Of course, in those days film distribution was a lot different from today. Back then only a few prints of movies were usually produced and they made their way around the country, region to region. So going DTV really was a sign of trouble. Today the landscape has changed dramatically. It's all about the first week, getting as many prints out to as many multiplex screens as possible. Movie distribution today has more in common with carpet bombing than with any carefully thought out marketing strategy. With a movie print costing well north of a grand, hitting 100+ cinemas is a gamble many are unwilling or unprepared to make.</p> <p>Many movies sidestep the DTV tag by playing in as few cinemas as possible (occasionally even just the one). This provides a chance for the movie to get reviewed as a theatrical release, and justifies shelling out for a celluloid print.</p> <p>There are many types of DTV. Most of the films of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/oct/12/artsfeatures1\">Studio Ghibli</a> bypassed the movie houses here, but few would question their quality. DTV isn't just an arena where lower tier Baldwin brothers or the Chris Mitchums and Frank Stallones of this world can build a career on their relatively famous surnames. Or where actors once tipped for stardom like Michael Par\u00e9 can thrive. Or where action heroes in decline, such as the once-mighty Steven Seagal, can create mayhem on the film-maker-friendly streets of Prague. Or even where a studio such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum\">The Asylum</a> can rush out cash-ins that arrive on shelves at the same time as a blockbuster with a similar theme hits the cinemas: movies like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2-6XdiR1iI\">Transmorphers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkSpowTU3YU\">Street Racer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" hi0on\" the shelfkyzmzcvg\">I Am Omega</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLePMOi7Jiw\">AVH: Alien vs Hunter</a> or .</p> <p>This year has seen a raft of releases that never had any intention of hitting a movie screen. Here's a pick of a few, each with their own reasons for going DTV.<br> <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=_woGjV_q8fM\">Starship Troopers 3</a><br>Not great but there's a real sense of everyone putting extra effort in that's quite endearing. Making a film depicting interstellar war with a cast of only around a dozen takes a lot of work. There is some horrendous acting but plenty of action and effects. James Cameron's FX-collaborators the Skotak brothers mix up the CGI with plenty of old school techniques. It may not always look real, but it does always look real cool. First time director Ed Neumeier, writer of Robocop and the first 'Troopers aims for the dumb smarts of the original with nifty ideas on religion, war and politics and nods to Heinlein's novel, but his lack of budget and experience makes one miss the more subtle approach of Verhoeven, which is something I thought I'd never say. <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=IaCSjHfVOFw\">Wake Up Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie</a><br>As making it up as you go along seems to be the way most US comedies are made, there's plenty of footage that doesn't make the final cut. You could stick them on a DVD as extras or, like this, cut them together to feature length and use a voice over to paper over the cracks. It plays like a slightly less funny version of Anchorman, which means it's still funnier than plenty of \"proper\" comedies. <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ib4g-AVmGhQ\">Get Smart's Bruce And Lloyd Out Of Control </a><br>A blockbuster release like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125551/get.smart\">Get Smart</a> uses such a great deal of resources - advertising, sets, merchandise - that it's a shame to waste it all on just one movie. This takes two peripheral characters and gives them their own mildly amusing adventure, with some overlaps to the main feature. It hit the shops the day Get Smart hit cinemas. It's the Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead of DTV. Expect to see more of this sort of thing.<br> <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZFA4tOntfE\">Lost Boys: The Tribe</a><br>Watching this it's hard to see whether they thought they were making a sequel or a remake. The emptily glossy MTV style original could easily stand a decent emo-friendly remake, but this isn't it. Looks the the real drama went on <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=yF4YA8HMsGY&amp;feature=related\">behind the scenes</a>.<br> <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=iXrhcQ7M-K4\">Batman: Gotham Knight</a><br>There's a section of society that will buy anything with Batman in it, so it's nice when a cash-in actually has a little thought behind it. This has six directors, each with their own style and approach, tackling the Dark Knight in short animated instalments. Some are better than others but they all explore the character more effectively than any of the big screen versions. Are you a fan or a hater of DTV? Even been surprised by a good one? Perhaps some of the Disney DTV sequels have charmed you? Will you watch anything with \"Fatal this\" or \"Deadly that\" in the title? Or does online rental now mean that such impulse purchases are now a thing of the past?</p>",
  "<p>The management gurus have been strangely reluctant to come forward with their views about the credit crunch. What could explain their unaccustomed shyness?</p> <p>Back in 2005, London Business School's late Sumantra Ghoshal caused a furore in the groves of academe with a paper called Bad Management Theories Are Destroying Good Management Practices, which excoriated the business schools for their role in helping to create the Enron and WorldCom scandals.</p> <p>Business schools, Ghoshal said, \"do not need to do a great deal more to help prevent future Enrons; they need only to stop doing a lot [that] they currently do. They do not need to create new courses; they need to simply stop teaching some old ones\u2026 It is our theories and ideas that have done much to strengthen the management practices that we are all now so loudly condemning\". In particular, obligingly backed the cult of shareholder value and macho management with ideas that were both self-serving and pseudo-science.</p> <p>Ghoshal should be living at this hour. Managers from Bear Sterns, AIG, Merrill Lynch and others may not have done anything strictly illegal, but they are nonetheless in a direct line of descent from Enron in their devotion to their own cause. </p> <p>In the FT last week, US economist William Lazonick reported that from 2003 to 2007, the top 500 American companies, including all those now in trouble, spent a stunning $1,700bn on buying back their own shares. Major beneficiaries, of course, were senior managers loaded to the gills with stock options. Lehman Brothers bought back $5bn of shares in the three years before it went bankrupt, money that could have come in handy these last few weeks. On his own admission CEO Dick Fuld took home \"between $250m and $350m\" since 2000 \u2013 and, as late as September, the company was seeking authorisation to pay out more than $22m in bonuses to departing executives.</p> <p>Consultants and accountants, likewise deafening in their silence, will also be in the firing line for having lucratively devised and legitimised such schemes.</p> <p>The secret that, understandably, none of the experts wants to admit to is that the heart of today's problems is human behaviour, not impersonal flows of money. Since it's people wot done it, it's there that the remedy has to be applied. What kind of remedy? Step forward two Harvard professors who in this month's Harvard Business Review, the US business bible, propose a radical solution: making management a profession, like medicine or the law, complete with its own Hippocratic oath, covering both personal ethics and wider responsibilities to society as a whole.</p> <p>Ironically, given HBR's leisurely publication lead times, the piece doesn't even mention the financial crisis. But that does nothing to alter its accidental timeliness. The profs have given the game away: we can only avoid further episodes like this by junking the extraordinary and offensive idea that managers' only task is to make money and put responsibility back where it belongs \u2013 as managers' Job One.</p>",
  "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/10/david-gergen-mccainpalin-rallies.html\">Aravosis</a>, David Gergen on Anderson Cooper last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>COOPER: There's also the question of ruling after this and bringing the country together. It's going to be all the more harder to do that whoever wins with all this anger out there.</p> <p>GERGEN: Yes. There is this -- I think one of the most striking things we've seen now in the last few days. We've seen it in the Palin rallies. We saw it at the McCain rally today. And we saw it to a considerable degree during the rescue package legislation.</p> <p>There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence. I think we're not far from that.</p> <p>COOPER: Really?</p> <p>GERGEN: I think it's so -- well, I really worry when we get people -- when you get the kind of rhetoric that you're getting at these rallies now.

  "<p>R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Find out what it means to Dallas Cowboys linebacker Bradie James: \"I come in here on Monday and I'm trying to enjoy my win and people are, like, beating us up.\"</p> <p>\"Even though we say: 'Who cares?', it affects us. Even though we say it doesn't matter, it can.\"</p> <p>\"Everybody expects us to be some kind of superheroes, which in essence we kind of are \u2026\"</p> <p>For a superhero James sure is thin-skinned. Unhappy at a perceived lack of respect for his team's achievements, James wasted no time unburdening himself after <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80b65fe4\">the Cowboys' 33-21 win over the Cincinnati Bengals</a>. By the end he had even informed reporters that they were partly responsible for the Cowboys' defeat to the Giants in last year's playoffs.</p> <p>In doing so, of course, he validated much of the most scathing analysis that has been written about this Cowboys team. That they are talented is beyond doubt. They are also vain, lacking in leadership and completely over-sensitive to outside criticism.</p> <p>When this season began the Cowboys were expected to win the NFC at a canter. They boasted 13 returning Pro Bowlers and were coming off a 13-3 season in which they had outscored everyone except the New England Patriots. When Pats quarterback Tom Brady went down in their season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were immediately installed as favourites for Super Bowl XLIII.</p> <p>But then they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/sep/29/ussport\">were beaten at home by the surprising Washington Redskins</a>, and things began to go awry. Wide receiver Terrell Owens complained about the play-calling, despite having the ball either thrown or handed to him 19 times in that game. Cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones blamed team-mate Pat Watkins for a 12-men on the field penalty that undid a potentially huge third down stop by the Cowboys late in the game.</p> <p>A response was expected against the winless Cincinnati Bengals, but despite a nine-point margin of victory, the Cowboys were unconvincing for the second week running. After leading 17-0 at one point in the first half, the Cowboys allowed the Bengals to close to within a point by early in the fourth quarter. Only a failed two-point conversion prevented the Bengals from tying the score at 24 later in the game.</p> <p>A win is a win, of course, and even the unbeaten New York Giants \u2014 currently top of every major power ranking \u2014 needed overtime to beat those Bengals in week three. But then the Giants didn't ask for a pat on the back afterwards. \"We can't buy into it when they are praising us or they are dogging us,\" reflected Giants quarterback Eli Manning this week after his team's <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=29595&amp;season=2008&amp;displayPage=tab_gamecenter&amp;week=REG5\">44-6 rout of the Seattle Seahawks</a>, carefully avoiding the word \"superhero\".</p> <p>The fact is the Cowboys are still a very strong football team \u2014 they have four wins, rank first in the league for points scored (with 151) and third for total. Their quarterback Tony Romo has the fourth-highest rating in the league and their running game averages 5.0 yards per carry. They will almost certainly be involved in this year's playoffs. Their reaction to recent setbacks, however \u2014 and even more so to press coverage of their setbacks \u2014 raises questions over whether they are mentally strong enough to live up to expectations once they get there.</p> <p>Much comes down to head coach Wade Phillips. Dallas needed a fresh start last season following the departure of Bill Parcells, and Phillips was just that \u2014 a soft-spoken man who believes in the carrot rather than the stick and would never upset the team's bigger egos by calling them out in public. A record of 17 regular season wins and just four defeats suggests he has done a pretty solid job.</p> <p>But a career playoff record of zero wins in four attempts also brings into question whether he is the man the Cowboys need right now as they chase a Super Bowl with an expensively assembled team that can only be kept together for so long. If James is right that the Cowboys are affected by what is written about them, then Phillips is to blame. \"I don't believe bitching is coaching,\" said the coach recently, justifying his refusal to call out players for bad performances, yet he is reported in Dallas to have devoted entire team meetings to doing just that about individual newspaper reports. He may not be at Joe Kinnear's level, but Phillips still felt moved to tell Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Randy Galloway \"I think you stink\" after he slated the team's performance against Cincinnati.</p> <p>Even if criticism has been excessive, Phillips would do well to start focusing his energies on matters he can control. The Cowboys defence has given up 111 points in five games \u2014 third-highest among teams with a winning record, and ranks 14th in the league for total yards surrendered. Romo has been playing excellently, but has also thrown at least one interception in each of the team's last nine games (including their playoff defeat). Opponents have scored 26 points off turnovers by the quarterback already this season. The contrast with the Redskins \u2014 who have given up one special teams turnover and none on offence \u2014 is compelling.</p> <p>And then there's Pacman Jones, who reportedly brawled with one of his own bodyguards at a party hosted by hip-hop artist Ludacris in a Dallas hotel on Tuesday. Pacman has played well for the Cowboys this year, making 20 tackles and breaking up six passes, but this week's news sounds all too familiar for a man who has only just returned from the year-long suspension he was given after being arrested six times in his first two years in the league. No police report has been filed on the incident, but that does not necessarily preclude a further league suspension. Regardless of the NFL's official stance, Phillips may want to consider how the player's on-field value weighs up against the trouble he brings off it. Team owner Jerry Jones has warned Pacman on several occasions already this season to reduce his \"visibility\".</p> <p>In the meantime, the Cowboys face up to an important road game against the Arizona Cardinals (3-2). Nobody considers the Cardinals Super Bowl contenders, but they are the best team in the NFC West right now and have won eight of 10 games at home since Ken Whisenhunt became head coach last year. They have outscored opponents at the University of Phoenix Stadium 72-17 in two games so far this season. The Cardinals boast the third-best passing offence in the league and will test a defensive secondary that is likely to be without cornerback Terence Newman and safety Roy Williams.</p> <p>The real challenges for this Dallas team will come in their remaining divisional games, as the NFC East is currently 10-1 against the rest of the league. But if James and co want a better write-up, a big win in the desert would be a good place to start.</p>",

  "<p>A high court judge today dismissed a claim by the family of the barrister Mark Saunders that the investigation into his shooting by police was unlawful.</p> <p>Saunders, 32, died of multiple bullet wounds after a five-hour siege of his Chelsea flat by police, during which he shot at officers, neighbours and buildings with a legally owned shotgun.<br> Mr Justice Underhill was told at the hearing last month that the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry was flawed because officers involved in the siege were allowed to confer before recording their accounts. </p> <p>Tim Owen QC, representing the deceased divorce lawyer's sister, Charlotte Saunders, said there was a \"substantial risk of collusion and of contamination\" and questioned whether the investigation was compatible with human rights laws.</p> <p>\"There was a delay in providing initial statements. The Metropolitan police commissioner has now admitted that there was, in fact, conferring between the officers,\" Owen said, adding that the IPCC had provided further opportunity to confer by organising meetings attended by groups of officers to put the questions to them. </p> <p>Miss Saunders' lawyers said the judge had found, \"after some hesitation\", that the IPCC was entitled to go along with the police's current practice of conferring because the IPCC claimed that, if it insisted officers did not confer, they might refuse to give any account at all. </p> <p>The IPCC chairman, Nick Hardwick, welcomed the judge's decision, saying the court had recognised the \"uniquely difficult job firearms officers do\". But he supported calls by the IPCC to change the way police officers conferred after a fatal shooting. </p> <p>\"Both families and the IPCC agree that the way officers currently confer after a fatal shooting does not provide best evidence or secure public confidence and should change,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The court recognises that any new post-incident procedure must command public confidence, but also acknowledges the fears of firearms officers about the way they might be treated,\" he said.</p> <p>Hardwick warned new procedures should take care not to treat firearms officers in these circumstances as suspects, \"unless there is evidence to justify doing so\". </p> <p>He added the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) was developing a post-incident procedure to provide \"best evidence\" and urged Acpo to finalise and publish the new procedure quickly. </p> <p>Speaking after the judgment, Miss Saunders said: \"It is encouraging that the judge agrees that this practice might well be unlawful and that he decided that the 'opportunity for collusion is institutionalised'.\"</p> <p>She said she would be writing to the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, urging her to look into the matter before her brother's investigation was completed. \"I hope she will agree that something should be done urgently.\" </p> <p>The judge gave permission to take the case to the court of appeal.</p>",
  "<p>The New York Times has reported how authors, teachers, librarians and publishers are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/books/06games.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin\">embracing video games in order to attract young readers</a>. The Rings of Orbis game, for example, is intricately tied to <a href=\"http://www.pjhaarsma.com/docs/books/books_main.php\">PJ Haarsma's series of science-fiction novels</a>, which players have to read in order to navigate the game. Now the debate has begun about whether games are legitimate teaching tools or just gimmicks that cheapen literature.</p> <p>Defenders of reading are up in arms about the threat to literature that technology supposedly poses, and perhaps for good reason. Commenters on the Times article took exception to the idea that games might one day create fictional worlds as complex as those of literary masterpieces. Commenter Patricia in Pasadena, California wrote: \"The 'fictional universe' of Dostoevsky is shaped by morals, ideas, emotions and religion - things that can't be properly rendered in a video game.\" Another commenter added: \"I'd like to see a single study that shows video games teaching anything more significant than hand-eye coordination. How completely absurd.\"</p> <p>As a reader myself, I agree that it's insulting when the books that have so beautifully described and shaped our culture are compared to educational video games that are, at best, pretty poorly scripted. No one (or at least no reasonable reader of books) expects or hopes for video games to replace literature. However, among those who criticise video games, there's a serious lack of understanding of the games themselves and the people who play them.</p> <p>First, video games can improve basic comprehension in a way that isn't painful for a student who struggles with reading. To see words on screen and engage in the actions associated with that text is a very simple, straightforward way to develop and practice reading skills. In the early 1990s, I played a game called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_Rabbit\">Reader Rabbit</a> on my family's computer. It was fun, and I was good at it, and I grew up to be a writer. That doesn't prove that Reader Rabbit is a great teaching tool - after all, I still rely heavily on spell check, and I learned much more from my parents' reading to me than I did from any video game. But the grammar games did help prepare me for diagramming sentences in the fourth grade.</p> <p>Games can also help players develop other skills. For example, a game like <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/articles/games/call-of-duty-waw-fire-and-destruction-trailer-2008107/\">Call of Duty</a>, which is a hugely popular series, can be viewed on one hand simply as violent because it's a war game. On the other hand, if you've ever actually played the game, you'll notice that it requires a significant amount of strategic know-how and team cooperation, things that are not as simple as they seem. </p> <p>Much like real-life games of capture the flag or paintball, players in Call of Duty split up into offence and defence, and teammates protect one another to achieve goals together. To play well as a team requires not only practice but also strong communication and cooperation, something not many classrooms are teaching these days. Granted, Call of Duty was developed for entertainment, and for mature players, not for teaching the very young to read, but there is simply no doubt that a well-built video game, just like any other challenging pastime, can be <a href=\"http://heraldnet.com/article/20081007/NEWS01/710079892/-1/news01\">intellectually stimulating</a>.</p> <p>We have no reason to think a method of learning is less valid due to it's being in digital format versus print, and if students are developing this digital literacy, then teachers can only fall behind if they <a href=\"http://www.literacyandtechnology.org/volume10/harushimana.pdf\">choose to discredit the digital format</a> (pdf). It's unlikely that anyone will ever hold Haarsma's young-adult books and game up as artistic masterpieces, but if they can help a child learn, then by all means, let the child learn.</p> <p>Now, is a game like Call of Duty likely to inspire readers? Well, with the proper marketing, maybe it could. The Call of Duty series, except for one game, is based on the second world war, and the weapons and scenes are taken from that period. If that game were promoted alongside historical books about the war, I imagine at least a few people would pick them up. The point is not to make light of the war or to trick people into reading but to spark their curiosity. A good game associated with an interesting storyline can encourage a person (child or adult) to pick up a book and find out the rest of the story.</p> <p>At the end of the day, though, quality is the key. Believe it or not, gamers have a pretty well developed palate. They don't fall for every cheesy gimmick, and they hold games to a stringent standard of play, graphic quality and, yes, storyline. If we want to read your book, we'll buy the book. If we want to play a video game, we'll buy the video game. While the combination of two mediums can result in a great product, it's not a given. In the long run, using video games to reach an untapped audience of readers is a great idea, but it's going to take a game that's good enough to play in the first place.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338467615\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The leaders of a long-running campaign to derail the Thai government have been bailed today after surrendering to police following charges of inciting unrest. </p> <p>The move comes as Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the former deputy prime minister, told a Thai newspaper that a military solution was the only way to solve the political crisis. </p> <p>Sondhi Limthongkul, one of nine heads of the People's Alliance for Democracy (Pad), and six others were bailed for inciting unrest and illegal assembly after recent demonstrations in the capital, Bangkok. The charges carry between three and seven years in jail.</p> <p>\"Everything is done. There is no detention,\" Sondhi said. \"It is the final war. We cannot lose. If we lose, the country will be gone.\" </p> <p>Pad is calling for sweeping electoral changes and trying to force the resignation of the new prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, whom it sees as a puppet of his brother-in-law, the deposed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p> <p>The reopening of Thailand's parliament on Tuesday saw the latest in a series of violent clashes between police and anti-government protesters, which left two people dead and more than 400 injured, including one police officer skewered on a flagpole. </p> <p>Protesters also targeted police headquarters and set fire to cars. In a move that Somchai described as the \"international standard\", police used teargas to clear a path for MPs. One protester lost his foot from a teargas grenade and a female demonstrator was killed.</p> <p>The seven men were originally charged with treason in August, the day after Pad protesters stormed a state television station and overran the prime minister's official compound, but the charge was quashed by the Thai court of appeals yesterday. The decision was seen as a major blow to the government and the police who were hoping to lessen Pad's power by weakening its leadership.</p> <p>The court also called for the authorities to use \"soft means\" to deal with demonstrations. It dismissed charges of insurrection, stockpiling of weapons and refusing to disperse. Two other Pad leaders who were arrested on charges of inciting unrest were freed yesterday.</p> <p>In a front-page interview with the Bangkok Post, Yongchaiyudh, the chief negotiator with Pad who resigned as deputy prime minister after the protests on Tuesday, said: \"After the military steps in, power should immediately be returned to the people and an interim government can be formed in which every party takes part.\"</p>",
  "<p>Findings from the so-called Troopergate inquiry could represent an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">October surprise</a> for Sarah Palin, according to an Alaskan Democratic senator, Hollis French, who is running the investigation. </p> <p>It's a complicated tale triggered by a messy family divorce but the main allegation is that Palin dismissed Alaska's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, because he refused to fire state trooper Mike Wooten. Wooten is Palin's ex brother-in-law. </p> <p>Palin says Monegan was asked to step down because of his \"outright insubordination\" and \"rogue mentality\". Monegan says he was fired because he refused to submit to pressure, from Palin's husband, Todd, and other aides, to sack Wooten.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/10/AR2008101000254.html\">Washington Post</a> says the 14-member legislative panel that has conducted the inquiry could recommend that the case be closed, that another committee continues to investigate, or that the matter be referred to criminal investigators. </p> <p>Monegan tells the paper he has not seen the report and does not know what to expect.</p> <blockquote> <p>I just hope that the truth is figured out. That the governor did want me to fire him [Wooten], and I chose to not. You just can't walk up to someone and say, \"I fire you.\" He didn't do anything under my watch to result in termination.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the Post, the report will also focus on Todd Palin, who had \"extraordinary access\" to the governor's office and her top aides. </p> <blockquote> <p>Todd acknowledges calling and meeting over the course of many months with numerous senior government officials about Wooten, whom he described as a dangerous and unstable man who had threatened his family.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the New York Times, there's a lengthy account of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/10trooper.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=safety%20bear&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">the kind of pressure</a> Monegan is alleged to have come under. </p> <p>On one occasion, a senior official is said to have phoned Monegan saying Palin was going to the 2007 state fair and did not want to see Wooten there. Wooten had volunteered for duty at the fairgrounds - in full costume as <a href=\"http://www.dps.state.ak.us/ast/safetybear.aspx\">Safety Bear</a>, the troopers' child-friendly mascot.</p> <p>\"I thought to myself, 'Man, do they have a heavy-duty network and focus on this guy',\" Monegan said. \"You'd call that an obsession.\"</p> <p>The Times says interviews and documents show the governor, her husband and seven administration officials contacted the commissioner and his aides about Wooten three dozen times over 19 months.</p> <p>Wooten also recalls a conversation with Sarah Palin in which she told him that Wooten was \"not the kind of person we should want as a trooper\". He told the governor that there was no new evidence to pursue.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/550229.html\">Anchorage Daily News</a> examines the 25-page statement Todd Palin submitted to the investigation. Palin is unapologetic about his efforts to get Wooten fired, but he says he doesn't think those efforts had anything to do with Monegan's dismissal.</p> <p>\"I have heard criticism that I am too involved in my wife's administration,\" Todd Palin wrote in his statement. \"My wife and I are very close. We are each other's best friend. I have helped her in her career the best I can, and she has helped me.\"</p> <p>\"Todd Palin's statements may help provide the governor some degree of cover in the probe,\" says <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/09/politics/main4511568.shtml\">CBSNews.com's senior political editor, Vaughn Ververs</a>, \"but the level of his involvement here will probably raise even more questions and this continues to be a political distraction to the McCain campaign.\"</p> <p>The estimated 300-page report and 1,000 or more pages of supporting documents produced by the investigation are due to be released later today.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 9 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Stansted</strong></p> <p>The government backed plans to allow expansion of Stansted airport to handle an extra 10 million passengers a year. </p> <p>The transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, granted permission to increase the number of flights from 241,000 to 264,000 and raise passenger numbers from 25 million to 35 million. </p> <p>Planning permission for the expansion was originally refused on grounds of noise and environmental concerns by Uttlesford district council in November 2006, but Hoon overruled it after an appeal by airport operator BAA. </p> <p><strong>Banking bill</strong></p> <p>The Tories pushed for a full debate on the financial crisis next week as it was announced that the banking bill would be debated by MPs on Tuesday. </p> <p>Theresa May, the shadow leader of the Commons, urged ministers to change the business to hold a full day's debate in the house on the financial meltdown. </p> <p>Harriet Harman, the leader of the Commons, agreed that there did need to be \"adequate time\" to debate \"these important issues\". </p> <p>She promised they would be fully debated and that ministers would be held accountable but offered no immediate change to the business. </p> <p><strong>Iceland</strong></p> <p>Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said that ministers were holding talks with council chiefs about the hundreds of millions of pounds invested by British local authorities in Icelandic banks. </p> <p><strong>Big Brother</strong></p> <p>Lord West of Spithead, the security minister, said in the counter-terrorism bill's committee stage debate: \"It is absolutely right that we have to be very careful about not moving towards a Big Brother-type society.\" </p> <p>Harman said that the bill, containing controversial plans to allow the detention of terrorism suspects for up to 42 days, would return to MPs after being considered by peers. </p> <p>Amid claims that ministers have given up hope of getting the proposals through the Lords, she said it would be dealt with in the \"usual way\". </p> <p><strong>Sir Ian Blair</strong></p> <p>Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, threatened to tell the media he had no confidence in Sir Ian Blair, the outgoing commissioner of the Metropolitan police, unless he resigned, Lord West said. </p> <p>He also claimed he had seen a letter from Johnson that contradicted the mayor's claim on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not want a long gap before the appointment of a replacement. </p> <p><strong>Smacking</strong></p> <p>MPs were not able to vote on whether smacking children ought to be banned because the government failed to allow enough time for the issue to be debated in parliament, Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem party president, said. </p> <p>He urged ministers to ensure that in future enough time was given to debate amendments and new clauses so that parliament could \"do its job properly\". </p> <p>Harman sidestepped the issue of smacking but said there had been \"adequate time\" for the controversial human fertilisation and embryology bill to be debated. </p> <p><strong>Peter Mandelson</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown's decision to grant a cabinet return to Peter Mandelson came under fire from David Taylor (Labour, Leicestershire North West). </p> <p>Taylor said the business secretary had \"no mandate\" and would not be accountable to MPs because he would only be allowed to appear in the Lords. </p> <p>Harman said that ministers would be accountable to the Commons and that Mandelson would be accountable to the Lords. \"The work of that department will be fully accountable to both houses.\" </p> <p><strong>Army bullying</strong></p> <p>The government will not tolerate bullying in the armed forces - but training for soldiers must remain \"robust, hard and challenging\", the armed forces minister, Bob Ainsworth, insisted. </p> <p>He said that the issue was whether the armed services could \"eradicate bullying entirely\" without losing the \"rigours of the training regime\". </p> <p><strong>Abortion</strong></p> <p>A bid to change the law on abortion in Northern Ireland by forcing a vote during the passage of the human fertilisation and embryology bill would be \"highly inappropriate\", Nigel Dodds (DUP, Belfast North) warned. </p> <p>Dodds said that the province's political parties were \"united\" in their opposition to any relaxation of the law. </p> <p>Harman replied: \"It is very important the view of the parties is taken into account irrespective of the issue that is being raised. Also it is important that the views of men and also women are taken into account in all parts of the UK when services are being considered.\" </p> <p><strong>Police</strong></p> <p>The Black Police Association is a \"divisive organisation which is stirring up racial tensions\", Philip Davies (Con, Shipley) claimed. </p> <p>He said he could see no difference between the organisation and a \"white police association\" and it should be scrapped. </p> <p>Harman said there had historically been an under-representation of black and Asian officers in the police and this was why there was a Black Police Association and not a \"white police association\". </p> <p><strong>Farepak</strong></p> <p>The fact that thousands of families are still awaiting the results of an official investigation into the collapse of Christmas savings scheme Farepak is \"not acceptable\", Harman said. </p> <p>She promised to \"get some answers\" on why the report by the companies investigations branch of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had not been published. </p> <p><strong>Powergen</strong></p> <p>Brian Iddon (Labour, Bolton South East) accused an energy firm of \"terrible behaviour\" by pushing him into \u00a31,000 of debt. </p> <p>He said that Powergen \"rarely\" sent him an electricity bill, which had led to him getting into debt. </p> <p>Harman said: \"Without pre-empting myself I think the question of how energy companies are operating in this difficult situation looks like a frontrunner for the topical debate next week.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Slumps and slurs</h2> <p>As the Dow Jones index plunged, the candidates continued to focus relentlessly on the economy. John McCain pushed his retooled mortgage buy-up plan, while Barack Obama mocked it and called on the US treasury to implement the bailout agreed last week \"as quickly as possible\". But yesterday was also the day that a subtext of the recent campaign - the increasingly ugly tone of supporters at Republican rallies - became something more than a subtext.</p> <p>McCain and his running-mate, Sarah Palin, continue to raise questions about the extent of Barack Obama's associations with the Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers, because they know it's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain4\"> logically impossible to prove a negative</a>,\" Daniel Nasaw writes on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>. But some supporters are going further. In recent days, audience-members at McCain/Palin events have shouted \"treason!\" and \"terrorist!\" about Obama, and \"kill him!\" about either Obama or Ayers. One reportedly used a racial epithet at a black TV sound engineer, and told him to \"sit down, boy\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama1\">Videos circulating on the internet</a> yesterday showed other rally attendees speaking about Obama's \"terrorist connections\". Rally warm-up speakers have referred to \"Barack Hussein Obama\" at least twice.</p> <p>In a statement, the McCain campaign sought to distance itself from what it calls \"inappropriate rhetoric\", but for the first time the Republican National Committee will today launch ads in Indiana and Wisconsin that mention Ayers's name. And in Wisconsin yesterday, when one man took to the microphone to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccain_supporter_rants_about_h.php\">call the Democratic contender a hooligan and a socialist</a>, McCain replied: \"The gentleman is right.\" The race, it seems, may get much dirtier yet.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Ohio, McCain is in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Today also marks the conclusion of the Troopergate investigation, which could see Sarah Palin censured for abuse of power in the firing of the head of the Alaskan police, allegedly because he refused to become involved in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">a family feud involving her brother-in-law</a>, a state trooper. Palin has said she had other reasons for dismissing the police chief. </p> <p>Palin emerges from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin1\">Ian Cobain's mega-profile</a> in today's Guardian as a rentlessly ambitious climber whose bid for the mayoralty of Wasilla was conducted with an eye to the presidency of the United States. \"She's really pretty insecure,\" her mayoral campaign manager says. \"I was with her before she gave a speech to the people from BP in Anchorage when she was running for governor, and she was terrified. There are real fears there. But every time she goes out and persuades people to like her, it lifts her, it makes her feel better about herself ... She's a brilliant politician, but it's all about getting more and more people to love her.\"</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>One day of post-debate data did little to change the major tracking polls. In Gallup's, for example, the candidates remained in exactly the same position as yesterday \u2014 Obama on 52% and McCain on 41%. Obama continues to surprise in battleground states. In one new poll he leads McCain 51% to 43% in Virginia, a state which hasn't gone Democratic in a presidential election since 1964.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/09/sarahpalin-republicans\">Tomasky talk: Troopergate won't implicate Palin</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/10/barack-obama-tv-ad\">Obama buys 30-minute TV ad</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/10/uselections2008\">Younge America video: 'Race relations ... are abominable'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/afghanistan.johnmccain\">Simon Tisdall: Fighting talk is self-defeating</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama\">Ed Pilkington: McCain has the look of a loser</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-useconomy\">Deadline USA: a housing crisis tour of Riverside</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/debate-may-have-helped-obama.html\">FiveThirtyEight.com: Debate may have helped Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14444.html\">Politico: Hispanics turn cold shoulder to McCain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100902331.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">EJ Dionne, Washington Post: Obama v McCain is FDR v Hoover</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Joe Biden has been off the trail due to the death of his mother-in-law, but yesterday he was back, and cracking wise: \"Sarah Palin says, you know, 'I was in second grade when Joe Biden was elected to the United States senate'.

  "<p>The gun allegedly used to kill the schoolboy Rhys Jones replicated the distinctive wounds inflicted in his shooting when fired in tests, a court heard today. </p> <p>The 11-year-old Liverpool schoolboy was gunned down in a pub car park in Croxteth Park on his way home from football practice in August last year. </p> <p>It is claimed he was hit by a stray bullet fired at members of the north Liverpool gang Nogga Dogs by Sean Mercer, 18, a member of the rival gang Crocky Crew. </p> <p>According to Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, the bullet - which entered Rhys's back slightly above his left shoulder blade and exited through the front right side of his neck - produced a noticeable \"keyhole effect\" on Rhys's body instead of a neat entry wound.</p> <p>Quoting the scientist who conducted the tests, Flewitt said the resulting wound was consistent with the bullet hitting the 11-year-old \"partially or fully sideways-on\" instead of nose-first. </p> <p>Neil Flewitt QC said a similar wound was created in tests on the .455 Smith and Wesson believed to have been involved in the shooting, using three of the .45 Colt cartridges recovered with the weapon.</p> <p>\"His tests revealed that the bullets produced the same distinctive 'keyhole' effect that he [the scientist] had identified on Rhys Jones's football shirt,\" Flewitt said.</p> <p>He said the unusual wound was the result of the bullet \"tumbling nose-over-base\" in flight rather than flying nose first in a stabilised manner.</p> <p>A bullet tumbling in this way is usually due to an undersized bullet or one discharged from a gun with a smooth-bore barrel or from a barrel with worn rifling. It could also be caused by deflection if the bullet passed through an intermediary target.</p> <p>According to the scientist, the tumbling bullet that killed Rhys was undersized by 0.08mm and the rifling of the revolver was worn.</p>",
  "<p>It's all in Kondratiev, people. Forget Nostradamus. The world's current predicament was prophesied in the early 1920s by the Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev. This Marxist student of western economies - who was to die in Stalin's purges - claimed to discern \"Long Waves\" of growth and contraction in the capitalist mode of production. Every 50 to 60 years, he argued, the development of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business\">world market economy</a> seems to hit its buffers. Kondratiev drew this conclusion from looking at economic figures from the 18th century to his own time: he predicted a slump was imminent, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/04/useconomy\">Wall Street Crash in 1929</a> proved him right. The wave may have been longer this time but its down curve seems potentially just as steep. Yet I haven't noticed many references to Kondratiev in coverage of the current crisis. </p> <p>And no wonder. Today's economists and economic journalists are steeped in the culture of the market, and deprived like most of us of the one intellectual tradition that might offer some rational solace in these times. Marxism died as a serious intellectual pursuit in 1989 along with the revolutionary state that had first nurtured, then killed, Kondratiev. Along with the unmourned bathwater of communism went the often civilised and deeply intelligent ideas advanced in the name of Marx - including, above all, the richly textured thought of Marx himself. </p> <p>Neither an authoritarian nor a humourless dogmatist, Marx in reality wrote subversive and witty accounts of the modern world. Read his essay <a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm\">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</a> if you want to get a truly ironic and perceptive handle on the delusions inside which most political life takes place. And read Capital, if you want to grasp the concept of an economic system as something coherent and organic. Of course it will depress you, as things stand, because it's as obvious as Marx's beard that the madness on the markets is not just going to affect banks, but everyone, with the most shocking political consequences. If you want to get primed on that, the sharpest introduction is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Age-Extremes-Twentieth-Century-1914-1991/dp/0349106711\">The Age of Extremes</a> by another great Marxist, Eric Hobsbawm. </p> <p>My God - is capitalism a crock? If so, what bad luck that a bunch of Russian gangsters jumped history's gun in 1917 with their \"dictatorship of the proletariat\". What a joke that communism and all but the mildest socialism were buried before the crisis Marx looked forward to finally came. When Hegel said that history always repeats itself - says Marx in the Eighteenth Brumaire - he forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.</p>",
  "<p>Everybody splashes around up to their ankles in a real lake on the set of young American writer Tarell Alvin McCraney's In the Red and Brown Water - which is running at <a href=\"http://www.youngvic.org/whats-on?action=details&amp;id=2146\">London's Young Vic</a> until November 8. But if water is everywhere in this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">show</a>, so is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jazz\">jazz music</a> and the blues.</p> <p>The lake symbolises the Louisiana bayou, in which McCraney's play is set, but also the primordial element from which the ancient deities of West African Yoruba culture created the land, and then the creatures on it. Oya, the teenage girl the play revolves around, is a potential star sprinter whose dream of freedom from southlands poverty and racism lies in the feel of her pumping feet thumping the solid earth. Oya was also a Yoruban deity (the name means \"wind\" or \"storm\"), so the show turns on whether the earth will indeed support her sprint to fulfilment, or the swamp of history, habit and destitution will suck her down in the end. You ought to check out this vigorously-performed and sporadically very poetic play to find out.</p> <p><a href=\"www.dune-music.com/artist_index.asp?ID=5\">Abram Wilson</a>, the New Orleans-raised trumpeter and singer who has made a big impact on the British jazz scene since he moved to London in 2002, supplies a live soundtrack to the action, and an improvised counterpoint to much of the dialogue. Wilson is just about the perfect musician for this tough task. He emerged from the musical background in the American south that also nurtured trumpeters Wynton Marsalis and Roy Hargrove, he's a sensuously romantic soul singer (as anyone who's heard his accounts of Motown classics with the vivacious Jazz Jamaica band will know) and a selfless collaborator whether as an ensemble member or as a charismatic educationalist. Wilson's New Orleans cultural heritage also tells him plenty about how west African <br>influences came via slavery to the New World, in voodoo ceremonies, religious beliefs, songs, rituals and dances, and in the vocalised instrumental intonations, warped \"blue\" notes and drum-patterns from which jazz blossomed in the late 19th century and early 20th.</p> <p>So the subject-matter and location of In the Red and Brown Water makes jazz a natural accompaniment to the action - natural in the sense that it nurtures and enhances the powerful emotions in the play, without drawing attention to itself. Wilson has not created an elaborately fashioned score, but made a freewheeling place for himself as the \"Egungun\" - the embodiment of ancestral spirits who prowls around the actors playing raunchy trumpet slurs when muscle-men parade their sexual credentials, derisory snorts when women exchange riotous mockeries, and a haunting long cadenza at the end <br>of the first half that's one of the show's most memorable moments.</p> <p>Jazz has often featured in theatre, of course - but mostly in musicals, or in shows that have a jazz-related theme, like Jack Gelber's famous 1950s jazz junkie play The Connection, which the great tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon acted in on occasion, and for which he wrote the music. But jazz has usually found its way on to a theatre stage as a dumbed-down representation of some kind of subcultural exotica, rarely as an integral part of the drama and meaning of the show. Sparingly, but tellingly, Abram Wilson's music makes exactly that contribution to the impact of In The Red And Brown <br>Water.</p>",
  "<p>Should London be picking a fight with Reykjavik, home of Sporticus*, the children's TV hero (of whom more later), at the height of a global financial crisis? I think not. Nationalism, not nationalisation, is the worry that should keep us awake at night now.<br><br>So Whitehall's move - and Gordon Brown's bellicose tone - smack of unnecessary British unilateralism at a time when international cooperation is vital. It also smacks of bullying a small neighbour, its 300,000 population about that of Cardiff. </p> <p>More than that, the use of the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act to freeze \u00a34bn worth of assets of the failed Landsbanki on Wednesday night strikes many lawyers \u2013 diplomats too, I hope \u2013 as wrong, an abuse of process and power. No wonder Iceland's prime minister and new 24/7 TV star, Geir Haarde, is offended.</p> <p>It will probably all be sorted out quickly enough, though anyone old enough to remember Britain's protracted cod wars with Iceland \u2013 they ran for 20 years into the mid-70s \u2013 should not bank (bank?) on an easy resolution. </p> <p>Iceland was determined to extend its territorial waters to 200 miles to protect its fish stocks \u2013 one of its few resources \u2013 and warships became involved on both sides. Nato had to intervene and arbitrate between two member states. Very humbling to us, they basically won their far-sighted strategy.</p> <p>So is the discovery that at least 108 UK local authorities \u2013 25% of the total \u2013 plus charities, the police, universities and housing authorities have placed up to \u00a31bn in Icelandic banks, attracted by high interest rates that should have made the finance officers hesitate, but clearly didn't.</p> <p>It's a reminder that, though the banking sector is mostly to blame for the Great Crash of 2008 now underway and government-plus-regulators were also nodding on the touchline, we all played our modest part. </p> <p>People playing the max-the-multiple-credit-card game as well as card firms offering credit to children, those of us who withdrew all that equity from our homes, and all the other daft options (a 125% mortgage is surely the definition of negative equity?) \u2026 most of us did something silly.</p> <p>And so, it now transpires, did our councils, notwithstanding the nasty cold some of them were similarly embarrassed by in a bank collapse a few years back. One hundred and fifty thousand private UK citizens too. Risky stuff, I'd say. I wonder which newspapers urged their readers to go north and place the nest egg in another (even smaller) currency. I think we should be told - but won't be. Meanwhile ministers, reluctant yesterday, may be forced to bail them out, too.</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/10/banking\">a letter in today's Guardian from Willem Buiter and Anne Sibert</a>, two LSE professors (Buiter once sat on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee) Iceland's banks credit rating has been in serious doubt for at least six months, hence the high interest rates.</p> <p>Of course, the Icelanders have been reckless in expanding their banking sector from such a slender base to what it was until a few days ago. But haven't we all? </p> <p>Icelanders have lived precariously on the edge of the world for thousands of years, mostly in poverty, sustained by their heroic sagas and myths, and by near universal literacy for over 100 years. Such was their sturdy sense of independence that they won autonomy from Denmark in 1904 and steered clear of the EU. </p> <p>That may change now \u2013 just as Scotland's banking disasters in the 1690s steered it towards the Act of Union (1707) with England and may sustain the union in the present one.</p> <p>So Icelanders may be better equipped than most to endure renewed hardship. As with much else we shall see. The US is interested in Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling's rescue plan \u2013 with one of its three prongs as buying bank stock, not toxic debt \u2013 while the EU's France and Germany are sniffy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, our old rivals in Moscow have not been idle. Ponder, if you have not, the news that Russia, awash with petro-cash even if its emerging stock market has unwisely closed (how can they price assets now?), has loaned Reykjavik $4bn to tide it over. Why not? </p> <p>Iceland skilfully used its cold war importance to move away from fishing and farming - too far away, it now transpires - and if Europe and the US are now too preoccupied to help, it will look elsewhere. We can only be grateful it was Russia with its not-very-good navy stirring trouble, not China, that made the loan.</p> <p>But that is how the world now turns. Not very far away is Iceland - <a href=\"http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=56.752723,6.064453&amp;spn=36.537529,79.101563&amp;z=4\">check the map</a>. As we keep repeating here, it's nationalism, not nationalisation, that ought to be keeping us all awake now. </p> <p>Nationalising the banks was a necessary expedient, but a return to nationalisation is not the answer, however tempting to old lefties. If China and Russia have given up, it's no time for us to relaunch a People's Republic of our own. Banks are like the utilities: we need them more than we need most things. </p> <p>If it helps, think of them and their product - money and credit - as a form of sewage. We just have to keep the shit moving or we all die.</p> <p>* Who is Sporticus? You clearly don't watch children's TV. Known in its native Iceland as Latibaer, it is a brilliant show, known in 100 countries as LazyTown or some such variant. Written, devised and starring a former gymnast called Magn\u00fas Scheving, it urges its little viewers to eat better and take exercise. David Cameron is a fan. It's also terrific, one of Iceland's better exports.</p>",
  "<p>As a female diner, with all the requisite ladyparts, one may be able to wear trousers rather than pretty dresses, dine alone, drink hard liquor, or even pay \u2013 but there's something about being in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/restaurants\">restaurant</a> that makes traditional gender roles weirdly firm and bizarrely unshakable, like military velcro or Donald Trump's hair.</p> <p>Reading through <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/08gend.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">one food critic's observations on gender roles in restaurants</a> made me wonder whether this affects the way we enjoy a meal. Ladies have a nice little L marked next to their order, apparently, to make sure their plate gets put down first. Men still get given the wine list and the bill, while women get their wine poured and their chair pulled out from under them (though not while they're sitting on it \u2013 that would be mean).</p> <p>And while that's all very traditional and classy and \"proper\", sometimes the trappings of silver service can lead to the most annoying gender stereotyping. Now I know it's dangerous to rock the boat. If you're paying for good service, why complain when you're treated too well? </p> <p>It's always shaky ground \u2013 questioning good service or nice manners for not being quite right, in case it gets taken the wrong way, as if one would prefer to have a door slammed in one's face or be expected to do the washing up after coffee. But still, there are some points at which I would expect that the better the restaurant, the more capable the staff should be of reading their customers. Women are, if not just as, then at least somewhat likely to pay, to order, to ask to taste the wine, to eat quickly on business or expect to sit there for as long as they like because they're bloody paying for it.</p> <p>A waiter comes to the table, hands two menus to my boyfriend and one to me. My boyfriend hands the wine one to me and looks at the food one. The waiter comes back, asks my boyfriend for the choice of wine, my boyfriend points at me; sitting there holding the drinks menu, I order, he goes away ... He comes back, presents my boyfriend with the bottle \u2013 who then points at me again and watches as the waiter scuttles over and waits, looking at me slightly dismissively while I check the label but refuse a taste (it was a screw top, what's going to be wrong with it?) and then hesitates over whose glass to fill first \u2013 it would usually be the lady, he's just no longer sure who the lady is, apparently.</p> <p>Are we really still expected to act like \"ladies\" in a restaurant? (Especially when just saying that makes me feel like I'm quoting Little Britain and that, quite frankly, cannot be a good thing. Ever.)</p> <p>I've had someone try to order on my behalf just the once, and I had to move to the other end of the table before I lamped them. </p> <p>Yes, there are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/08gend.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">some restaurants</a> giving up the rules of who to ask first and who to serve last (and would it really cost so much just to print wine menus for everyone?) And yes, I know, if I want true egalitarianism, I should get me down to McDonald's, where they'll serve the next in line, whether your genitals are insies or outsies.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong, I love it when someone else is handed the bill but sadly, after that, I am expected to pay my share, if not someone else's as well. I'm not saying that elegance or etiquette should be shot to shit, just that perhaps it would be nice to be treated like equal customers if we're paying an equal share and drinking half the wine.</p> <p>But do you want that? Is it a crazy dream? Or is dining out in a restaurant one of the last places where you get to feel like a real gentleman or a proper \"lady\" and that's part of the experience that you're paying for? Oh, whatever, just leave the bottle on the table, will you?</p>",
  "<p>Feargal Sharkey once said, and I'm paraphrasing: \"When God handed out bullshitters, he gave an extra serving to the music business.\" I tend to agree with him, and at the <a href=\"http://www.inthecity.co.uk/showscreen.php?site_id=30&amp;screentype=site&amp;screenid=30\">In the City music conference</a> this past weekend, there were a few of them lurking around.</p> <p>In the City is a three-day event in Manchester, set up some years ago by Tony Wilson, where people from the music business have panel discussions during the day and spend the evenings checking out showcases by unsigned bands. This year the discussions focused on music's future in a digital world, and as is so often the case in this business, there were few artists present. But one panel centred on the rights of the people without whom the business wouldn't exist, as they discussed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/04/popandrock.tradeunions\">the launch</a> of the <a href=\"http://featuredartistscoalition.com/index.html\">Featured Artists' Coalition</a>. </p> <p>Over the weekend, much of the media reported on this launch (some insinuating that it was to be a union for millionaire rock stars) as Radiohead, Robbie Williams, David Gilmour and the Verve are involved. The truth is, without these big names signed up, the launch would have been largely ignored by the media - and the people who will benefit the most from this organisation will be up-and-coming artists.</p> <p>Young artists who are looking for a record deal are often broke and desperate to get the chance to release a record, get their music to a wider audience, tour and make music full-time, without having to go on the dole. But the majority of them are unaware of the implications of clauses in a record contract. In other words, desperation is not the ideal mindset when signing a deal that may determine the rest of a career. Often these young artists end up signing away ownership of their music and much of the control of what happens to it. If they do question anything, they're often told: \"It's industry standard\".</p> <p>The Featured Artists' Coalition will be run by artists for artists and won't accept such a brush-off. Kate Nash, who was joined by Radiohead manager Brian Message and the Verve's manager Jazz Summers on the ITC panel, pointed out that artists need to get educated and have a responsibility and the right to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7652053.stm\">take charge of their careers</a> and their music. </p> <p>Brian Message spoke of how excited Radiohead were about their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/oct/07/media.digitalmedia\">In Rainbows project</a>, since they were without a label at the time and had a chance to do whatever they wanted. He said: \"I see the FAC as an extension of the In Rainbows project.\"</p> <p>The FAC will advise artists not to sell their rights, but to license their work instead. They will campaign for the right of artists to retain ultimate ownership of their music and for agreements and negotiations to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner. </p> <p>In my blogs about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/oct/02/myspace.music.unfair.on.indies\">MySpace Music</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/sep/25/nokia.comes.with.music\">Nokia Comes With Music</a>, I've pointed out how artists have been completely excluded from negotiations between record labels and corporations. Even though both ventures have been launched, the artists and their managers are still none the wiser about how they will work and how, or even if, they will get a fair share of the revenue. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2783879/Jazz-Summers-invests-andpound10m-in-music-talent.html\">Jazz Summers pointed out</a>, a politician will be much more likely to pay attention if someone like Mick Jagger or Richard Ashcroft sits in on a policy meeting. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nme.com/artists/billy-bragg\">Billy Bragg</a>, who was unable to make it to the launch sent a message relaying how excited he was about this new initiative, saying: \"Together we're much stronger than separately,\" ending his message, \"If it becomes a rich boys' club - I'm off.\"</p> <p>I applaud the efforts of the Music Managers' Forum in setting up the Featured Artists' Coalition. But in the end, it's up to the artists to take the chance offered to make a lasting change in the way their work is treated. As Kate Nash concluded: \"If you care deeply about something, you should work hard to protect it.\"</p>",

  "<p>A delegation of Treasury officials will head to Iceland today in an attempt to resolve the diplomatic stand-off over its banking crisis.</p> <p>As Gordon Brown last night branded the country's failure to guarantee British savings in its defunct banks \"totally unacceptable and illegal\", it emerged that more than 100 local councils, police authorities and fire services have up to \u00a31bn lost in its bankrupted system.</p> <p>Charities, including children's hospices, warned they were at risk of losing \u00a325m.</p> <p>Treasury officials en route to Iceland hope to meet officials to discuss the crisis and find a solution that minimises the impact on UK individuals and councils with money in its banks.</p> <p>In unusually aggressive terms last night, the prime minister said he was willing to use anti-terrorism legislation to freeze the assets of other Icelandic companies operating in Britain in an effort to recoup the lost money. The extent of the potential difficulties for councils and other bodies began to emerge yesterday as more and more said they had invested money in Iceland's high-yielding savers' accounts.</p> <p>By yesterday evening, the Local Government Association (LGA) had accumulated reports showing that 108 councils in England, Scotland and Wales had deposited \u00a3798.95m in Icelandic banks.</p> <p>With no sign of Iceland being able to repay the money and councils lobbying ministers for reassurance that the cash would be recovered, Britain went on the offensive. \"What happened in Iceland is completely unacceptable,\" said Brown. \"I've spoken to the Icelandic prime minister, I have told him this is effectively an illegal action that they have taken. We are freezing the assets of Icelandic companies in the UK where we can. We will take further action against the Icelandic authorities where necessary to recover the money.</p> <p>\"The responsibility for this lies fairly and squarely with the Icelandic authorities, and they cannot simply default. The Icelandic authorities are responsible for this, and we are demanding the money is paid back to the local authorities, and we are prepared to consider all forms of action, including, as we did, attempting to freeze assets.\"</p> <p>Geir Haarde, Iceland's prime minister, said he was surprised by Brown's remarks, and urged him to consider resolving the issue in the courts. The Treasury said it had no imminent plan for a wider move against Icelandic companies operating in the UK saying the only action taken so far was the freezing of the Landsbanki's estimated \u00a37bn of UK assets.</p> <p>The British government invoked the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 to freeze the British assets of Landsbanki, something for which Brown refused to apologise, saying he had a responsibility to recover the assets in the most effective way possible.</p> <p>Referring to the move, Haarde said: \"I told the chancellor that we consider this to be a completely unfriendly act.\"</p> <p>Asked if the financial crisis engulfing Iceland had become a diplomatic crisis with Britain, Haarde added: \"I thought so for a few minutes this morning when I realised that a terrorist law was being applied against us. That was not very pleasant. I'm afraid not many governments would have taken that very kindly, to be put into that category.\"</p> <p>Haarde said Iceland had not decided on whether to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and negotiations to secure a \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.2bn) loan from Russia would not begin until Tuesday.</p> <p>Under Iceland's financial regulations, the government is supposed to pay up to \u00a316,000 compensation per frozen account at a total cost of \u00a32.2bn.</p> <p>Britain is angry since it has received no assurances from the Icelandic government that it would meet this commitment. It is estimated that British investors have a total of \u00a38bn deposited in the Icelandic banks, including \u00a34.6bn in the Icesaver internet bank.</p> <p>In an effort to work out the scale of the potential exposure of public bodies to the Icelandic banking collapse, leaders of local councils met with John Healey, the local government minister, yesterday.</p> <p>At the meeting in London the councils tried to persuade the government to guarantee their savings, in the same way that ministers had guaranteed the savings for individual investors in Landsbanki. But Healey refused to give any such commitment after the meeting. Instead he said the government \"will not leave councils under pressure on their own\". He conceded that the councils had not acted recklessly, and had been following Whitehall advice sent out in 2004 to spread their investments across a wide range of banks.</p> <p>Local councils pointed out that they had been given legal advice that the Icelandic banks had three star credit ratings, and there was no way of predicting this collapse was imminent. \"The local councils are well informed investors. This is not money that is lost, it may be money that is at risk,\" a statement said.</p> <p>After the meeting, the LGA said \"a small number\" of authorities faced specific short-term problems.</p> <p>In a joint statement, the LGA and the government said: \"For those local authorities who are facing severe short-term difficulties government and the LGA will agree an appropriate set of ways to assist. We will judge what's appropriate on a case by case basis.\"</p> <p>However, Ed Welsh, of the LGA, told GMTV today that the money was in the foreign banks to earn interest rather than to be used for current expenditure so the crisis was unlikely to cause immediate problems.</p> <p>\"We are hopeful this will not have an impact on frontline services,\" he said. \"In the long term, there may be an issue but it means deferring payment or tightening our belts.\"</p> <p>Authorities with big investments include Kent county council with \u00a350m; Nottingham city council, \u00a342m; Norfolk county council, \u00a332.5m; Dorset county council, and Hertfordshire county council, both \u00a328m.</p> <p>Fifteen police forces also have investments in Iceland, as does Transport for London (TfL) which revealed it had a \u00a340m deposit with Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, a UK subsidiary of the bankrupt Kaupthing bank.</p> <p>TfL, which runs the London bus and tube services, said it did not know if it would get the money back. But a spokesman said TfL's \u00a37bn budget was big enough to absorb the loss.</p> <p>Stephen Bubb, the chief executive of Acevo, the representative body for charity chief executives, urged the chancellor to guarantee the bank deposits of UK charities. He said the collapse of Icelandic banks had hit charities hard with some losing up to one fifth of their reserves, in sums ranging up to \u00a312m. The total losses reported to Acevo added up to more than \u00a325m. </p> <p>It also emerged yesterday that the 300,000 UK personal savers who had accounts with Icesave would be lucky to get their money back by Christmas.</p>",
  "<p>There are no prizes for guessing which news provoked the biggest response this week.

  "<p>During <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/holiday4.html\">Yom Kippur</a>, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, the port city of Akko erupted into race riots, after a clash between Jewish and Arab residents escalated into a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1027633.html\">battle involving hundreds</a> of willing participants. The initial incident was sparked by a handful of Jews hurling rocks at an Arab man, after they took umbrage at his decision to drive through the Jewish side of town on Yom Kippur, an act that apparently offended their religious sensitivities. </p> <p>When word of their attack spread around the Arab community, the response was swift, and as utterly unacceptable as the initial violence meted out by the Jewish attackers. Mobs of Arab locals went on a rampage, smashing cars and vandalising shops belonging to Jews, until police took control of the streets and forced them to a halt. As soon as the Israeli press got back to work after the Yom Kippur hiatus, the reaction was fast and furious, with both sides rushing to condemn the other via the media. </p> <p>When I likened the wanton destruction I witnessed in Nil'in to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom\">pogrom</a>, I was hauled over the coals by my detractors for the language I employed. A few months on, and it appears that the word is enjoying something of a renaissance: Ehud Olmert using it to describe a wave of settler attacks on Arab villages, and \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017498195&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">last night</a> \u2013 at least three MKs calling the Yom Kippur war in Akko a pogrom, albeit from polar opposite sides of the spectrum. </p> <p>Yuval Steinitz, a firebrand Likud politician took the view that \"Israel has become the only country in the world where pogroms against Jews are taking place\"; hot on his heels came Estherina Tartman's racist outburst, in which she claimed \"The pogrom in Akko is another proof that the Arabs of Israel are the real threat to the state\". Countering these claims was Ahmed Tibi, one of Israel's few Arab parliamentarians, who called the events a \"Jewish pogrom\", accusing the police of discriminating against Arab residents of the city during the disturbances. </p> <p>Last night, a <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017501207&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">second round of clashes</a> brought heavy police intervention, with the mixed city seemingly unwilling or unable to return to its pre-Yom Kippur state of calm and tolerance. While there is little doubt that what took place during the disturbances definitely walked and quacked like a pogrom, focusing on the symptoms rather than the disease is an unhelpful way of addressing the situation. </p> <p>That anyone should feel so affronted by a non-Jewish citizen driving his car on Yom Kippur that they hurl rocks in response is as absurd a reaction as the recently-exposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/21/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast1\">ultra-orthodox vigilantes</a> in Jerusalem, who take the law into their own hands to uphold religious law. For a country so determined to criticise \u2013 rightly \u2013 the Taliban-style behaviour of many Arab states, it is incredible that such practices are not clamped down upon when they occur closer to home. </p> <p>Religious fervour has an alarming way of dragging its followers, and their unfortunate victims, back to Bible times. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7516238.stm\">Stoning women</a> in Iran is matched by stoning Arabs \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 daring to contravene Jewish law in Israel; the violators apparently deserving to be injured or killed for simply exercising the free will that the modern world extends to them. </p> <p>I spent the entirety of Yom Kippur in synagogue, paying no attention whatsoever to what others might or might not be doing while I was fasting and praying. The only way I could have been offended by others' actions would have been if it directly impeded on my ability to carry out my religious obligations: if anyone had played music beneath the synagogue's windows, for example. However, catching sight of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/24/dayofdivision\">hundreds of cyclists</a> who come out of the woodwork every Yom Kippur wasn't offensive in the slightest; their violations of the day being their look-out, and no one else's. </p> <p>The inherent problem with any country fashioned along religious lines is that the moderates get buried under a pile of rocks and a stream of abuse; a state of affairs to which both Israel and Gaza can attest. Jews attack other Jews for daring to contravene the seating arrangements on \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6584661.stm\">modesty buses</a>\"; Palestinians <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gazas-christian-bookseller-killed-396283.html\">do likewise</a> to their non-believing brethren in similar acts of fundamentalist rage. </p> <p>Sceptics will say that Akko was a tinderbox waiting to explode, and that religious sensibilities played little part in the initial outburst of violence, in the same way that Sharon's infamous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_3687000/3687762.stm\">tour of al-Aqsa</a> was dismissed by rightwingers as incidental to the outbreak of the second intifada. However, the fact remains that politicians and commentators alike have been only too quick to jump on the religious bandwagon, claiming to be mortally hurt by the Arab driver's actions, as though Israel's otherwise untainted religious purity was irredeemably stained by his decision to \u2013 quite legally \u2013 drive on Yom Kippur. </p> <p>The local police chief described the incident as a \"deliberate provocation\" by the driver, while saying precious little about the decision by his assailants to resort to hurling rocks and bottles to express their displeasure. But in that case, why don't the police end the nationwide tradition of bike-riding on Yom Kippur, if such acts are deemed to be a provocation to those adhering to religious law? The answer's pretty clear, and gives the lie to any claim that Israel is any more tolerant than its peers in the Arab world. </p> <p>There is much to be said for respecting others' religions and customs, but at the same time \"<a href=\"http://www.grupthink.com/answer/115337\">your freedom ends where my nose begins</a>\" cannot \u2013 and must not \u2013 be allowed to extend to a national scale. When that happens, and when the state apparatus fails to condemn such behaviour, then the game is well and truly up. And all the screams of \"pogrom\" in the world won't cover up who the true Cossacks are in such a case.</p>",
  "<p>Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has finalised a proposal that will commit the future of their international players to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/indianpremierleague\">Indian Premier League</a> at the expense of Test cricket. Most immediately the deal means that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/srilankacricketteam\">Sri Lanka</a>'s two Test tour of England next year will not take place. </p> <p>\"The series is definitely off, since it has not yet been ratified by the ECB and still remains subject to approval,\" commented an SLC official. \"So, there is absolutely no chance they are going to sanction a series against a Sri Lanka A side.\" </p> <p>The SLC has always suggested that its star players would be unavailable for the tour of England because of their IPL commitments, and today's announcement not only confirms that to be the case, but suggests that the IPL will be the Sri Lankan Board's top priority for the next decade. </p> <p>Sri Lankan sports minister Gamini Lokuge is understood to be the man driving the deal with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) through. In return for committing its centrally contracted players to play in both the IPL and the Champions League for the next 10 years, SLC would receive $70m from the BCCI. The BCCI has also offered to include Sri Lanka in two tri-series in 2009 and 2010 as an extra financial incentive. </p> <p>In the place of next summer's Test series against England SLC have offered the ECB a three-match ODI series to be played around May 25. They are also reported to be considering an offer to play in a Stanford tournament next June. </p> <p>The Sri Lankan Cricketer's Association discussed the new deal with Lalit Modi, chairman of the IPL, last two weeks ago. The proposal has not yet been ratified, but representatives of both parties will meet to discuss the fine print of the deal on October 19. It is believed that the deal would include one caveat which would permit Sri Lanka's Test tour of England in 2010 \u2013 scheduled to clash with the IPL \u2013 to take place.</p>",
  "<p>Croatia promotes tourism with the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=jmNZE4MzM3g\">slogan</a>: \"Croatia, the Mediterranean as it once was\". It might be nearer the mark to say: \"Croatia, Central Europe as it was in the 1930s and 1940s\".</p> <p>The postcard beauty that characterises this former Yugoslav republic with its breathtaking landscapes and its unique archipelago often finds itself at odds with another reality, that of its society, haunted by ghosts of the past, ridden by an astonishing intolerance against minorities, in particular the gay one.</p> <p>My own postcard dream was abruptly shattered one evening last year. While walking back home along the central <a href=\"http://www.find-croatia.com/photos-croatia/zagreb/trg-bana-jelacica/zagreb-trg-bana-jelacica9.html\">Jelacic Square</a> in Zagreb, I was chased and beaten by a group of about 10 men. As their insults indicated, I had been deemed not masculine-looking enough. As my screams filled the air, the crowd on the square stayed aloof. And as blood dripped from my head, the two policemen who happened to pass by chose to ignore my assailants and interrogate me, refusing even to offer me protection on my way back home.</p> <p>Such attacks, I was later to learn from gay rights organisations and various witnesses, abound in Croatia. To say that they are under-reported in the international press would be an under-statement. The targets are gays but also black tourists and other minorities. In what seems to have become a national sport, groups of young men, some of them belonging to far-right organisations but also others hastily classified as \"hooligans\", specifically target all manifestations of \"queerness\".</p> <p>Beyond these incidents, an atmosphere of fear reigns among the gay community: a gay caf\u00e9 owner who is paranoid about any patron showing signs of \"gayness\" for fear of having his establishment ransacked by neighbours; a gay activist who lives in constant fear of being recognised on the street after appearing on TV, his mobile stuck to his hand with the police number on hold.</p> <p>Croatia's homophobic tradition appears to be a long-standing one. Under the Yugoslav communist regime, and although homosexuality was de-criminalised in 1977, such physical attacks did occur, if less often than today. And when gays were not abused by the general population, the police took turns. After the emergence of modern Croatia in 1992 and during the ferocious war that ensued, murderous homophobia seemed to peak. This climate endured in the aftermath of the war and culminated in a particularly gruesome murder when a gay Frenchman was found with his skull crushed by the boots of skinheads in a park near the train station. As his relatives recounted, he had fallen in love with the country and wanted to settle in it with his boyfriend. Ever the lure of the postcard ...</p> <p>Later, under leftwing governments, some progressive laws were passed, including one against hate crimes and another allowing civil partnerships. In 2002, Zagreb witnessed its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb_Pride\">first Gay Pride parade</a>, protected by a tight cordon of police and marred by violent Catholic and rightwing protest. Hateful violence showed its head once more during the 2007 parade when six protesters preparing to throw Molotov cocktails at the marchers were arrested at the last second. They were promptly released without charge and it took a persistent campaign from gay activists to have them arrested again and charged. Only <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/30/europe/EU-GEN-Croatia-Hate-Crime.php\">one of them</a> was convicted \u2013 proof once more that legislation, implementation, and general sentiment are in most cases three independent and often conflicting realities ...</p> <p>In the light of this, the Croatian authorities' attempts to appear \"gay-friendly\" look more like lip service to EU standards than sincere and serious instruments of change.</p> <p>The reasons behind such uptight and violent attitudes towards homosexuality in Croatia are complex and deeply rooted. The lack of diversity in a society where around 90% of the population is Croatian and Catholic and where the sighting of a coloured or \"original-looking\" person constitutes an event in itself, is undoubtedly a determining factor. In spite of this present-day homogeneity, Croatia has historically been at the confluence of three different cultural realms: Mediterranean, Balkanic and Central European/Germanic. These diverse influences can be felt in many different areas from language to cuisine to architecture.</p> <p>Although traditions and mentalities vary from one region to another, most Croats take pride in their Austro-Hungarian heritage, and being an industrialised and industrious nation, in contrast to their southern neighbours \u2013 an attitude very similar to that between northern Italy to its southern counterpart. </p> <p>As social history shows, and as abundantly illustrated in the novels of gay French writer Dominique Fernandez, productivity and economic wealth rarely go hand in hand with sexual laxity. In order to sustain productivity, competitiveness and sometimes imperialism, some European nations started strictly regimenting sexuality several centuries ago, with the active assistance of the church. Homosexuality was either outlawed or pathologised, the only legitimate practice being the reproductive, utilitarian one. It was only after the activism of the 1960s that wealthy western nations saw the empowerment of a gay minority who mainly used their economic and political potentials to obtain their basic rights. While the initial \"free love\" ideals were quickly abandoned, at least the essentials were secured.</p> <p>In communist Eastern Europe, things took a different turn. While heterosexual pornography was actively and widely diffused by authorities, a heavy taboo, inherited from centuries past, plagued the gay minority who could neither use economy nor politics to breathe some fresh air. This resulted in an immense discrepancy between hetero- and homosexual visibilities which can be felt to this day.</p> <p>In these circumstances, it is only understandable that some Croatian gay men seek refuge further south, as many northern European men have done in centuries past, including <a href=\"http://vongloedengayhistory.free.fr/\"> Baron von Gloeden</a> or Danish sculptor <a href=\"http://www.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk/page47.aspx\">Thorvaldsen</a>. My own first encounter with the gay realm was Miroslav, a member of the Yugoslav royal family living under a pseudonym in communist-ruled Zagreb. He felt happiest on his trips to a certain Northern African country where, despite a strict facade and repressive laws, sexual boundaries were loose and bisexuality was widespread and accepted. There, the gap between displays of homo-eroticism and hetero-exhibitionism was more balanced. Miroslav joined the far-right royalist party after the creation of modern Croatia, which leaves one pondering about the potential scope of the proverbial \"closet\".</p> <p>If only Croatia could make use of its Mediterranean heritage, not only in terms of architecture, but of attitude. If only it could draw the best of its multiple and rich cultural influences, not the worst. If only it could rise up to the challenges of globalisation not with stiffness and negativity, but with self-assurance and lucidity. Only then would the postcard become reality.</p> <p><em>Diamond Walid is the pen-name of a Lebanese-Croatian TV producer and writer, based in Beirut</em></p>",
  "<p>The failure of schools to address institutional racism and help disaffected black boys has exacerbated the knife crime crisis in the UK, a leading educationalist warned today.</p> <p>Gus John, associate professor at the Institute of Education and the former director of education at Hackney, attacked the role schools have played in the burgeoning violence in the second anniversary lecture to commemorate the death of Liverpool schoolboy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/02/ukcrime.football\">Anthony Walker</a>, who was murdered in a racist attack three years ago.</p> <p>John, who is himself black, said schools fail to equip white and black young people with an understanding of their past and its connection with the present condition of Britain.</p> <p>They also fail to \"equip them with the knowledge, skills and understanding to take control of their own lives, understand the origin and genesis of the hard won rights they now enjoy, safeguard and extend those rights and own their responsibility for making the future they face the future they want for themselves and their children, and not leave that responsibility to the elites that the system creates while they continue to exist on the margins and to implode\", he said.</p> <p>\"We bemoan their conduct and wring our hands when they slay one another, but don't insist on appropriate social conduct from them and demand a respect for other people's rights,\" John warned.</p> <p>A group of 80 disaffected black 12- to 16-year-old school students, with whom John worked in Bristol last year, said what they feared most was being killed and \"chillingly \u2026 one another\", John told the audience.</p> <p>\"When asked whether they felt their school was tackling that fear of violence and of death that worried them so much, most said that it was not the kind of thing on which teachers spent any time,\" he said.</p> <p>According to John, schools are too focused on enhancing school effectiveness, raising achievement and government league tables. This led to \"the destruction of hope, the death of aspiration, limited life chances and a burgeoning of the African presence in the prison population\".</p> <p>He urged schools to \"attend as much to students' self-development needs and to their identity formation as to their SAT, GCSE and A-level grades\".</p> <p>\"Let us demand that schools are organised and funded so that they treat children according to need and give them their entitlement to quality education that is not measured solely by their ability to gain five A* to C grades at GCSE.</p> <p>\"And if that means having class sizes of no more than six, where the children's needs demand it, then so be it.</p> <p>\"It is far cheaper and more societally just in a liberal democracy to do that than to spend billions keeping far too many young people in jail or young offender institutions year on year.\"</p> <p>John called on schools to do more for whole communities by running classes and groups in the evenings.</p> <p>\"It is increasingly the case that schools are not just excluding the young people who are the focus of attention in any response to knife and gun crime, they are excluding whole communities.</p> <p>\"Why not reclaim those publicly funded spaces and alter the image young people have of them, often because of the typically negative experiences with 'authority' they (and their parents before them) would have had within them?\" he said.</p> <p>John accused the education system of being \"institutionally silent for generations\" on the issues of race, inequality and social justice.</p> <p>\"Schooling and education has failed to tackle the issue of racism and its influence in shaping the identity of generations of white British people,\" John argued.</p> <p>\"Although the evidence persists of schools' institutionally racist practices - which lead to adverse educational outcomes for black students - Ofsted's approach is to apply a 'light touch' and not interrogate school's performance as far as eliminating discrimination and upholding the rights and educational entitlement of all students are concerned.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>What's your favourite piece of technology?</strong><br>At the moment mine would be the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipod\">iPod</a> Touch</p> <p><strong>How has it improved your life?</strong><br>It's improved my life in two ways. First of all, after watching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures.dvdreviews1\">Minority Report</a> I wanted something that's very futuristic that I could use with my fingers. Then I realised there was something else I could do with it \u2013 download TV shows off iTunes. Then my 2-year-old son got hold of it and started working it himself. Next thing I knew it became a great device for him, and for me to have lunches, or concentrate on some work while he was sitting in the corner playing with that. Then it became his \u2013 so in a way I lost it, but gained some free time.</p> <p><strong>When was the last time you used it, and what for?</strong><br>I used it about a week ago \u2013 I managed to get it off my son \u2013 and I took it on set with me, on a movie I was shooting. I had a five-hour gap, so I used it to watch some classic TV I had uploaded \u2013 the Andy Griffith show, I think it was. And an episode of Bear Grylls Survival.</p> <p><strong>What additional features would you add if you could?</strong><br>It's got pretty much everything at the moment \u2013 it's got Wi-Fi., so you can check your email etc. If it came with a stylus, like a little pen thing, it would be easier to write notes on it, along the lines of the Nintendo DS Lite. I like to take notes when I've got comedy ideas, and if I could use it to write on the Touch and then plug it in via USB and print it out, that would be perfect.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years' time?</strong><br>Possibly, but then I think most things will be. It could come out in 10 years' time as: \"Hey, it's the Classic iPod Touch!\" So yeah, I think it will be.</p> <p>What one tip would you give to non-iPod Touch users?<br>Get one, and make sure to get a cover for it to protect the screen. And if you really want it for yourself and you have 2-year-old kids, don't show it to them.</p> <p><strong>Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd?</strong><br>I'm not sure what a luddite is, and I'm definitely not a nerd. I guess I'm somewhere in the middle.</p> <p><strong>What's the most expensive piece of technology you've ever owned?</strong><br>My Sony Vaio. It's the first laptop I bought, and it was when they first came out, so it was a big thing. I just went into the shop and said: \"I'll have the biggest one you've got.\" I call it the Battlestar Galactica now \u2013 I've still got it \u2013 but I can't really take it around with me, it's too big.</p> <p><strong>Mac or PC?</strong><br>I'm PC. I think about going Mac, but I'm just a bit too scared; then I look at the PCs and they're really shiny now with lots of extra features, so I'm kinda torn.</p> <p><strong>What song is at the top of your iPod's top 25 most played?</strong><br>That would be The Humans Are Dead, by the Flight of the Conchords \u2013 the robot song.</p> <p><strong>Will robots rule the world?</strong><br>Yes, definitely, I think we're getting closer and closer to that. I'm going to make a prediction: I'd say 18 months' time, it's all over. Humans are slaves; the ones that are lucky to get away are down in the sewers, trying to plot a way to get back. And up above, on the surface of the Earth, robots are walking around, basically farming us.</p> <p><strong>What piece of technology would you most like to own?</strong><br>My own jet pack. I know they're available \u2013 I can't quite afford one yet \u2013 and I'm waiting until the flight time is a little bit more than 35 minutes. That's what I want.</p> <p><em>New Zealand comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2008/mar/13/auckland\">Rhys Darby</a> played Murray Hewitt on the TV series Flight of the Conchords.

At least not yet.</p> <p>Many restaurateurs have remained surprisingly bullish throughout the onset of this so-called recession, and their optimism is backed up by hard facts. Pub company <a href=\"http://www.mbplc.com/index.asp\">Mitchells &amp; Butlers</a>, for instance, has just released <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/item/2330/23/5/3\">positively buoyant new figures</a>. The world might be going to hell in a hand basket, but people still want to eat at a <a href=\"http://www.harvester.co.uk\">Harvester</a>. Insert your own joke here.<br><br>While people are still eating out, however, there is clear evidence that diners, at all levels, are keen to economise. <a href=\"http://www.toptable.co.uk\">Toptable.com</a> recently reported a 40% rise in the number of bookings it had handled in the first six months of this year. It's currently processing 10,000 covers a day. (Who knew? Am I the only person in Britain still using the phone when I want to make a restaurant reservation?). </p> <p>Of those diners, however, some 40-45% are taking advantage of the <a href=\"http://www.toptable.co.uk/offers\">900+ special offers available at the site</a>. The list currently includes a 2-for-1 breakfast offer at <a href=\"http://www.roast-restaurant.com/home.cfm\">Roast</a>; a <a href=\"http://www.gordonramsay.com/thedevonshire/menus/setlunch\">\u00a313.50 two-course lunch</a> at Gordon Ramsay's Devonshire pub; and a <a href=\"http://www.toptable.co.uk/venues/restaurants/?id=55\">\u00a325, four-courses-plus-glass-of-fizz deal</a> at <a href=\"http://www.bentleys.org/home\">Bentley's</a>. </p> <p>Many of these relative bargains aren't exclusive to toptable.com either. For instance, Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.hibiscusrestaurant.co.uk\">Hibiscus's</a> \u00a325 set lunch has long been one of the capital's best offers. All of which, here at Word of Mouth, set us thinking: just what is the best restaurant \"deal\" in the country? </p> <p>Last month, in Guardian Weekend, Simon Hopinkson lavished praise on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/06/restaurants.foodanddrink1\">prix-fixe lunch at Le Gavroche</a>. To recap, that's nibbles, three courses (three choices at each course, including cheese), half-a-bottle of wine per person, water, coffee and petit fours for \u00a348 a head. Yes, at that price, <a href=\"http://www.le-gavroche.co.uk\">Le Gavroche</a> may still be best suited to the gilded rich, but, \u00a3-for-lb, for two star cooking, in a restaurant with such history, this offer is rightly legendary.</p> <p>If you're flexible on times, and have the self-control not to go wild with the wine list, you can eat at many of Britain's best restaurants surprisingly cheaply. For instance, I've heard good things about the \u00a317.50, three-course pre-theatre (5pm-7pm) menu at <a href=\"http://www.arbutusrestaurant.co.uk\">Arbutus</a>; while the new-ish Angelus - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/foodanddrink.restaurants\">much admired</a> by our own Jay Rayner - is currently offering a three course set lunch menu, wine (half-bottle), mineral water, coffee and petits fours for \u00a336pp.</p> <p>Still too rich for your blood? Then how about the express lunch at <a href=\"http://www.sweetmandarin.com/reviews.html\">creditable Manchester Chinese</a>, Sweet Mandarin. \u00a35.50 for two courses sounds like a steal; as does \u00a36 for the Le Complet lunch (main course, tapas dish, salad, coffee) at <a href=\"http://www.list.co.uk/place/103133-chez-pierre\">Chez Pierre</a>, a new venture from <a href=\"http://www.pierrelevicky.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=4\">Pierre Levicky</a>, of Pierre Victoire fame. <br> <br>Personally, I'd have to go for the early bird \"tapas for two\" deal at <a href=\"http://www.elgatonegrotapas.com\">El Gato Negro</a>. You get six dishes, as chosen by chef Simon Shaw, and a bottle of house wine for \u00a335. It might be in West Yorkshire, but, seriously, EGN could hold its own among Barcelona's finest, <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=98374\">as this thread at eGullet attests</a>. </p> <p>But what about you? What are the best deals you've found? Where can we eat like kings for a fraction of the normal a la carte price? And, while we're on the subject, any horror stories? Ever turned up to dine on a voucher and been palmed off with soup and sardines? Been treated like leper because you're eating from the set lunch? People, we need to know ...</p>",
  "<p>Back at the allotment tomorrow, so this the last post from the beach hut for the time being. But, first, I'd like to riff on rosehips. Our beach is covered in rugosa: white and reds in many shades, single and double. So much so that the local authority has taken to attacking them, though suspect it is like trying to eradicate cockroaches in California. Happily, the banks are again quickly covered in green leaf and the heaviest, fattest, globule-like fruit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338458323\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/10/1223626706320/hips2.jpg\" alt=\"hips\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Summer rugosa near the beach hut</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So now, as well as collecting the semi-wild crab apples, the abundant blackberries, the prolific porcini, we find ourselves sitting at the table in the sun, removing all the seed so we can make rosehip jam. When I was a kid it was the other way round. We chucked the flesh in search of 'itching powder' to put down one another's necks. Made me smile when while searching for rosehip recipes on the internet I found an Australian aboriginal <a href=\"http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blrosehips.htm\">warning</a> that 'if ingested the seeds can cause 'itchy bottom disease'.' </p> <p>If you Google '<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=rosehip+recipes&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8\">rosehip recipes</a>' you will meet ZZ Top lookalike and wild food fan Bob Ewing, whose 17th-century <a href=\"http://hubpages.com/hub/Rose-Hip-Recipes\">jam recipe</a> is pretty much the same as ours. Wikibooks (think free, learn free) has a <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Rosehip_Soup\">recipe</a> for a Jewish rosehip soup, and there are also entertaining 'how to use rosehip' <a href=\"http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-use-rose-hip-recipes-205851/\">videos'</a>, but perhaps my favourite has to be Danish <a href=\"http://www.danish-schnapps-recipes.com/rose-hip.html\">rosehip schnapps</a> (dry them for a couple of days, steep in spirit for a month, strain and 'age' for another two months).

Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer until very soft \u2013 about 20 minutes (add more water if necessary). Add 1lb of sugar to 1lb of pulp and simmer. Check the taste and add more sugar if desired. Cook until the mixture has thickened to jam-like consistency.

  "<p>The China Business Post, a weekly financial newspaper published in China by Hong Kong-listed SEEC Media, has been suspended for three months by Chinese authorities after the newspaper ran a negative story on the Agricultural Bank of China, one of China's top four state-owned banks.</p> <p>According to the story published in July, a subsidiary of the Agricultural Bank of China in Hunan province allegedly wrote off 4.61bn yuan (\u00a3387m) bad debt, in breach of regulations, this year. The bank later denied most of the key charges and claimed it reserves the rights of further lawsuits. The newspaper responded by saying the investigation was fair without malicious intent.<br> Then, on September 25, the China Business Post put a statement on its website announcing that a \"superior administration\" <a href=\"http://www.chinafreepress.org/publish/Othernews/China_Business_Post_Caijing_Shibao_Newspaper_Suspended_for_Three_Months_for_Problematic_Reporting.shtml\">had imposed a three-month suspension of publication</a> on the newspaper because the superior administration believed the newspaper had violated several news propaganda protocols, including \"Local newspaper should not conduct cross-region investigation,\" \"News reporting should follow formal interview procedures\" and \"Important and sensitive reports should be presented to and confirmed by the reported side before publication\". </p> <p>\"Cross-region investigation\" is a unique term in China. All of the country's media must affiliate with an authority, a state or provincial governmental organisation. This imposes artificial boundaries on reporting in terms of speciality or region. </p> <p>In recent years this has seldom been observed but it is now being used to penalise the China Business Post. In defiant and discontented tones, the newspaper said it would appeal to the relevant authorities. <br> It is outrageous these rules are being used to suspend the China Business Post. I doubt any newspaper in the world would be able to produce any real investigative reports if they were restricted by these so-called news propaganda protocols.</p> <p>But this is the reality the media in China are facing. Here, all media are either owned or supervised by the Communist party of China. They are in principle only supposed to report on the positive side of the country. Any media daring to publish a negative story would potentially get in some trouble with the administrator.</p> <p>There are exceptions. For example, when the state-run news organisations like <a href=\"http://www.cctv.com/english/index.shtml\">China Central Television</a> (CCTV), <a href=\"http://www.chinaview.cn/\">Xinhua News Agency</a> and the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/\">People's Daily</a> report a negative story, it is usually seen as being officially sanctioned to send out a warning signal to the accused from the highest authority. In China, the media are regarded as the mouthpiece of the party. <br> Despite such strict control, gradual marketisation has fuelled more media openness. Foreign and private capital is now allowed to invest in the media sector. </p> <p>Those investors can help operate the business and share the profits but will have no say on editorial control and personnel appointment. This has created a strange situation in that investors in the media sector could lose everything overnight if superior administrators are not happy to see what is published. <br> Investigative business reporting has been tolerated more and more in China as the journalists keep testing the authorities' boundaries. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/china\">Sanlu milk powder scandal</a> is a good example. Without the media investigation across the country, the public wouldn't be aware of the level of the problem and how widely it had spread.<br> This time, however, the China Business Post got into trouble because the Agricultural Bank is a much more powerful organisation. The bank has a deep connection with all levels of the government. It is believed that, if the bank wishes, it could get the newspaper suspended by asking for help from senior officials in the Communist party's propaganda department.  So media openness in China has proved to be just an illusion and the extent of their freedom depends on whom the media are targeting. So-called propaganda protocols are murky and changeable. Before major political events, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/aug/15/the21edictsofchineseolymp\">media environment</a> usually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.chinathemedia\">gets tougher</a> and then loosens afterwards.</p> <p>It's not surprising that every newspaper editor in China, before running a story, has to assess the potential dangers and decide whether it's worth taking such a risk. A popular motto among Chinese editors is: \"Hit the fly, but stay clear of the tiger.\"<br> The suspension of the China Business Post rang <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9d764c0-8b14-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c.html\">alarm bells</a> among editors and journalists in China. Although Chinese journalists will definitely continue to test the propaganda administration's tolerance in the future, this has already been a setback, at least temporarily, to China's media openness. </p> <p>Journalists and editors will have to rein in investigative reporting for a while. One month after the Olympics and days before the third plenary session of the 17th Communist party central committee, scheduled from October 9 to 12, the media tightening is back.</p>",

This week, we welcome one of the team who made it, Juliette Culver, who's stood under the grill and has answered our tough questions. Keep reading for all kinds of insights into how to build your own (alternate reality) game for just \u00a31000.<br><br><strong>Explain your game to my mum in 140 words.</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.operationsleepercell.com/\">Operation: Sleeper Cell</a> is a game about biscuits, tea (stirred not shaken) and loveliness. It's an online game to raise money for Cancer Research UK and is free to play. You are trained as a special agent by a secret organisation known as The Agency that works to spread loveliness throughout the world. During the course of the game you work together with other agents to accomplish missions, solve puzzles, raise money for Cancer Research UK and eventually uncover enough intelligence to save the word from The Agency's arch-enemies E.V.I.L. You can also follow the inner goings-on at <a href=\"http://www.wearenottheagency.com/\">The Agency</a> and might even find things spilling over into real life...</p> <p><strong>How do players control the game?</strong><br>The game centres around 'the grid'. Some cells on the grid are 'sleeper cells' that give you missions to complete. As you do so, you go up in rank in The Agency and get access to more difficult missions as well as secret intelligence uncovered by the sleeper cells. But before players can access a mission, each cell needs to be unlocked with a donation. Sponsoring a cell in this way, gives the sponsoring team a head start over other players on the mission behind that cell. It's also possible to sponsor other cells on the grid with an image and link.</p> <p><strong>What is your background?</strong><br>Last year, there was a competition called <a href=\"http://www.letschangethegame.org/\">Let's Change Game</a> to design a game to help the work of Cancer Research UK. Our team, Law 37 won that competition and Operation: Sleeper Cell is the result. Everyone working on the game has been volunteering their spare time, so our backgrounds are really varied. Although we're new to making games such as this one, we've all been keen games players of some shape or form and in particular have a strong contigent of former Perplex City players.</p> <p><strong>Name your competitors.</strong><br>Not long after Operation: Sleeper Cell launched, The Red Cross announced a game called <a href=\"http://www.tracesofhope.com/\">Traces of Hope</a>. Also kicking off around now is <a href=\"http://www.superstructgame.org/\">SuperStruct</a>, a game about inventing solutions to future global problems. Both those games are very different from ours though - Operation: Sleeper Cell is far more light-hearted. Another big difference is that we're also trying to raise money for a charity as part of our game.</p> <p><strong>How many players do you have now and what's your target in 12 months?</strong><br>We've got about 200 active players since we launched at the end of September. We'd like to have a lot more by the time the game finishes at the end of November as well as hopefully have raised lots of money for Cancer Research UK! As well as providing some fun and raising money, we also hope that what we're doing will make people in the gaming world think about new ways that games can reach out and do good.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>Trying to fit making the game into our spare time! Everybody on the team has worked amazingly hard to make this game happen and it's incredible what they've achieved in the time. As well as that we've got team members as far apart as Edinburgh and Paris. This has meant that chances to meet and work on the game together in real life have been few and far between and we've had to make the most of what time we've had.</p> <p><strong>What's the weirdest development experience you've had thus far?</strong><br>That would probably be revealing too many secrets as to what is to come in the game!</p> <p><strong>What's your distribution/publishing plan?</strong><br>You can go an play it now. Just go to <a href=\"http://www.operationsleepercell.com/\">www.operationsleepercell.com</a> and sign up.</p> <p><strong>Are indie-developed games the latest killer app?</strong><br>It's been great having the creative freedom that we've had in developing the game. We were given a budget of \u00a31000 to make the game, and that's forced us to be quite imaginative but at the same time has enabled us to do lots of things that we wouldn't be able to without that sum of money. On the other hand, making the game with a household-name charity like Cancer Research UK behind us has also really helpful.</p> <p><strong>Are you the next big thing?</strong><br>It'd be great if it games for social causes such as charities and education did really take off. Games often have a reputation that leaves something to be desired - as timewasters or scapegoats. It'd be really great if we could turn that around and show that games can be a force for good in the world.</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday night the Arctic Monkeys premiered their <a href=\"http://www.arcticmonkeysattheapollo.com/ \">new concert film</a> at a small \"members only\" cinema in Soho (not a porno one). </p> <p>Called Arctic Monkeys at The Apollo, it was directed by The IT Crowd's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/oct/02/comedy.television \">Richard Ayoade</a>, who also did their video for <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=N64QMKEbJQg\">Fluorescent Adolescent</a>. That was a baffling dress-up extravaganza, but this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film\">film</a> - which is touring cinemas from October 13, then coming out on DVD the month after - takes the opposite approach. As the fuss-free title might indicate, it's a document of a single gig last year in which the band simply play their songs. No \"fantasy sequences\" a la <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_o'_the_Times_(film) \">Sign 'O' the Times</a> by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/prince\">Prince</a> or <a href=\"http://ledzeppelin.com/video/song-remains-same-ny-1973\">The Song Remains the Same</a> by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/ledzeppelin\">Led Zeppelin</a>; no <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ9vKKE4tlg\">pilgrimages to Graceland</a> like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/u2\">U2</a> in Rattle and Hum. But neither are there any shots of the crowd.</p> <p>I found this slightly weird. One of the amazing things about early Arctic Monkeys gigs was the fact that their fans roared along word-perfect to songs that hadn't even been released. While all gigs are a communal experience and not just about the band, this is (was?) especially true in the Monkeys' case. You can certainly hear the fans in the film and see them in the background from the vantage point of the cameras on stage, so this decision not to feature them seemed to shear the gig of half its excitement. After the screening, Ayoade said that ignoring the crowd was a conscious decision, that it would be too much like \"watching a party in a Hollywood film, which I think is one of the bleakest things ever\".</p> <p>Ayoade says that Arctic Monkeys at The Apollo is in the tradition of classic concert movies such as Talking Heads' <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/1999/09/16/sense/\">Stop Making Sense</a> and the Band's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=AKl9ZmS0NmQ\">The Last Waltz</a>, neither of which linger over the audience. However, while the Monkeys are musically as tight as a Republican senator faced with a $700bn bailout, as a performance Stop Making Sense is \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=FzEadbTCKDA\">considerably more theatrical</a> than the Monkeys show, while The Last Waltz features interviews and about a million guest stars (not to mention <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/martinscorsese\">Martin Scorsese</a> in the director's chair). Arctic Monkeys at The Apollo boasts Miles Kane from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jun/22/jazz.worldmusic\">the Rascals</a> (and later, of course, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/aug/22/popandrock.festivals\">the Last Shadow Puppets</a>) and a tiny smattering of Super-8 footage featuring the Monkeys faffing about drunkenly on a beach \u2013 while Alex Turner admitted that even he cringes at his diffident repartee (\"I always wish it were a sentence shorter\"). </p> <p>Ultimately, like most concert films, Arctic Monkeys at The Apollo is a fans-only affair. Have any concert films ever transcended that niche? Ponder (and let us know) while you watch what I think is the peak of Monkeys visuals, their awe-inspiring video for The View From the Afternoon. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GF978AgLyaY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GF978AgLyaY&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/GF978AgLyaY&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>It manages to encapsulate what's great about them without featuring the band at all.</p>",

  "<p>Serbia's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7658103.stm\">success</a> in persuading the UN general assembly to support its application for an advisory opinion from the <a href=\"http://www.icj-cij.org/\">international court of justice</a> (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence represents a victory not only for Serbia's diplomatic endeavours in recent months, but for the rule of law and multilateralism more broadly. The decision by many EU member states not to back this initiative, however, further demonstrates the EU's contradictory attitude and approach towards matters of international law. </p> <p>In a bid to deter Serbia's diplomatic efforts, several attempts were made to directly link the issue to the country's European prospects. Britain's ambassador to Serbia, Stephen Wordsworth, <a href=\"http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/12224/\">publicly warned</a> that the resolution would be \"a mistake\" that constituted \"a direct challenge to the EU\"; one that will \"only make cooperation and Serbia's integration into the European Union more difficult\". Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, meanwhile, stated that \"we have reiterated numerous times that Serbia cannot seek to join the European Union while also asking Europe to agree with the initiative\" and labelled the move \"self-destructively isolationist\".</p> <p>Having insisted that disputes in the western Balkans be settled through peaceful means, the EU's failure to support Serbia's initiative at the UN general assembly is fundamentally inconsistent and untenable. As the Serbian president, Boris Tadic, <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=53737\">re-affirmed</a>, \"our intention is not to repeat aggression or confrontation with the world, but to use a different methodology in politics which is not usually seen in the Balkans\".</p> <p>Advisory opinions from the ICJ, though non-binding, offer a powerful alternative for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, with solutions derived from the legal as opposed to political realm. To fail to act to strengthen such institutions of international law and justice at a time when the EU struggles to contend with Russia's recognition of South Ossetia's and Abkhazia's independence will only further undermine its standing in an increasingly unstable international environment. </p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_europes_un_human_rights_problem/\">recent report</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/\">European council on foreign relations</a> revealed, with respect to human rights issues, the EU's influence at the UN continues to decline. One of the explanations given concerns the double standards of European states which continue to oppose discussion of their own human rights problems, such as those concerning the treatment of migrants, and avoid criticism of the United States' persistent violations. Europe's failure to support Serbia's initiative, despite its avowed commitment to the principles of the UN charter, will only further reinforce this growing sense of inconsistency and ambivalence in international affairs.</p> <p>By returning the Kosovo issue to the legal arena, Serbia's resolution is likely to further stem the already sluggish recognition process. In spite of significant diplomatic pressure from the architects of Kosovo's independence declaration, <a href=\"http://www.kosovothanksyou.com/\">recognition</a> has been forthcoming from only 48 of 192 UN member states. Though the ICJ's verdict will not be binding, the decision to seek a ruling will <a href=\"http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/12224/\">very likely</a> \"slow down or halt the wave of recognitions\". With many countries deeply concerned by Russia's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/georgia.russia\">retaliatory recognition</a> of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, Kosovo will continue to struggle for international legitimacy. </p> <p>Should the ICJ decide that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence breaches international law, <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.yu/Officials/jeremic_e.html\">Vuk Jeremic</a>, Serbia's foreign minister, expects several countries, for instance <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=53911\">Costa Rica</a>, to retract their recognition. A ruling of illegality by the ICJ would inevitably reignite debate in several EU countries which were deeply divided domestically over the recognition issue, particularly Poland and the Czech Republic. Indeed, Poland's president, <a href=\"http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=479\">Lech Kaczynski</a>, recently <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=53743\">blocked attempts</a> to establish an embassy in Pristina and condemned the Polish government's decision to recognise Kosovo. </p> <p>The EU's failure to support Serbia's application for an advisory ruling from the ICJ raises important questions about its commitment to strengthening international law and multilateral institutions. The decisions of EU member states themselves cannot and should not be exempt from legal scrutiny; nor should attempts be made to threaten Serbia's European prospects in a cynical bid to deter its recourse to legal means. Instead, respect for international law should be the hallmark of the EU and its burgeoning common foreign and security policy. For it to recapture some of its lost influence at the UN, the EU must no longer persist in applying double standards to matters of international law and justice.</p>",
  "<p>About a month ago I wrote a very <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/15/2\">unflattering article about Ron Howard</a>. Among the things I wrote was that he was \"a middle-brow, middle-of-the-road film-maker who adapts his \"style\" to whatever subject comes his way.\" However, I'm pretty sure that if I had interviewed Howard on a one-to-one basis over lunch, I would most likely have found him witty, intelligent and charming. Therefore I would never have written such an article, although my opinion of his work would remain unchanged. Generally, however, whether charmed by the interviewee or not, I still find it almost impossible to write negatively about someone I have met socially. It's not that any of them would even be aware of what I might write or give a toss if they were, but I would still pull my punches.</p> <p>I often wonder how many critics repress or minimise negative criticism of a film after having met the director. Is it possible to be objective if one is pally with filmmakers as some critics are? (The theatre world, being smaller, is even more incestuous.) I must confess to having been guilty of writing a mainly positive review of a film, contrary to my true feelings. Some years ago, I met Louis Malle with the intention of writing his biography. He was extremely kind and helpful, and allowed me to spend some days watching some of the shooting of Damage. Later, when sent to review the film, I was very disappointed by it. Nevertheless, I wrote a review in which, to slightly paraphrase the Johnny Mercer-Harold Arlen evergreen, I \"accentuated the positive, eliminated the negative, latched on to the affirmative and didn't mess with Mister In-Between.\"</p> <p>It can, of course, work the other way. I know a critic who admitted to me that his aversion to most of Michael Haneke's films probably derives from his having had unpleasant encounters with the man.</p> <p>Ideally, it is better that a review is written by someone who has had no personal contact with the director. If that is not possible, then auto-censorship inevitably comes into play and the review, like so many, could be signed \"Mister In-Between\".</p> <p>On the other hand, I've never been able to resist telling a director what I really thought of their work on the few occasions I have met one. But how frank should one be if one disliked the film? Should one be dishonest by merely joining in the chorus of praise that surrounds the director? One could always emulate Oscar Wilde when asked by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree what he thought of his King Lear, replied, \"My dear Herbert, good is not the word!\"<br> My method is usually to start with the positive and then say, \"But I have a problem with the scene in which ...\" as if I am being obtuse. I recall coming out of a Norwegian film at a festival and meeting a friend in the lobby afterwards. \"What did you think of the movie?\" he asked. I then proceeded to list all the points I felt were wrong with it. \"Oh, really,\" he replied, indicating a young woman standing beside him, \"because this happens to be the director.\" She took it well and said that it was interesting to hear unadorned opinions that she wouldn't normally hear directly. In fact, some directors enjoy having the chance to defend their film verbally as they can't very well reply to a written review.</p> <p>Last year, at the Copenhagen Film Festival, I found myself sitting opposite Kenneth Branagh at a long table in a restaurant after a screening of his dreadfully wrong-headed version of Sleuth. Of course, the conversation turned to the film. Because you couldn't meet a nicer bloke than our Ken, I resisted my natural impulse to tell him what \"my problems\" were with his film. Instead, I brought up The Magic Flute, which I liked, and about which I wrote. Having spent a pleasant evening in Branagh's company, I could never have felt as free as Peter Bradshaw did in his devastating Guardian review of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121237/sleuth\">Sleuth</a>, in which he described the film as \"unendurably boring, stagey, boring, arthritic, misconceived - and did I mention boring\", despite my agreeing with every word.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I consider that it is acceptable to express one's views at a press conference, usually extremely sycophantic affairs. A few years ago, at a press conference in Cannes for Father and Son, a film I admired, I asked Alexander Sokurov, a director whom I hold in high esteem and whom I have interviewed, whether he considered his film homoerotic. Sokurov was apoplectic, and went into a long tirade against decadent western film critics, and their lack of understanding of the traditions of Russian family life and literature. It did not change my view of the film's gay subtext, but I felt chastened.</p> <p>In 2003, at the Venice Film Festival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/georgeclooney\">George Clooney</a> was being gushed over for his performance in the Coen brothers' misfire, Intolerable Cruelty, with someone comparing him favourably to Cary Grant. After a girl in the audience wearing a bridal veil proposed to Clooney, I rose and said pompously, \"May I raise the tone of this conference?\" Clooney replied, \"Why, do you want to marry me?\" \"No, but I'd marry Cary Grant,\" I said, rather wittily I thought. I then asked whether the very mainstream film would not alienate the Coen brothers' fans. \"Is that a question or an insult? I'll take it as an insult,\" Clooney responded angrily. But it opened up a more interesting discussion on what is commercial or not.</p> <p>Ironically, I rather admire Clooney. He's on the right side politically, he makes the most of the material he is given \u2013 he's very good in the Nescaf\u00e9 ad \u2013 and if we had met socially, I'd probably never have written an unkind word about him. It is only when directors or actors are just names on a screen that critics can express themselves completely freely, having no compunction in laying into a film, if they felt it was deserved.</p>",
  "<p>\"Last week's Sunday Express was riddled with appalling, slapdash and lazy writing and subbing. The style sheets handed out were studiously ignored, as can be seen by the list attached to this e-mail.</p> <p>There were also two errors so horrendous they moved one reader to email Martin Townsend to point them out.</p> <p>The kind of bilge submitted last week will not be tolerated any more. The rest of this email is a list of the drivel that made it into the paper but doesn't include the numerous dashes scattered liberally through copy, counties being abbreviated (Hants and Wilts were two that appeared), the headlines that were centred instead of set left, the ignorance about how the word 'but' should be used, the literal in one of the phoneline questions and the inability to grasp the simple idea that companies, organisations and political parties are referred to in the singular. My apologies to anyone who wasn't in last week but look on it as a reminder of how not to do it. So here we go:</p> <p><strong>P2</strong> \u2013 The lead begins with a name but the surname is not capped up. The stupid phrase 'ahead of' appears three times in the copy. We are then told 'fewer than one in five voters were happy with Brown's premiership'. That means none. The GCSEs story said 'almost six in 10 pupils'. So is that five or four? Voters and pupils don't come in fractions.</p> <p><strong>P3</strong> \u2013 Why wasn't there a drop cap start to the story? Those weekly paper staples 'local residents' and a 'local fan' put in an appearance.</p> <p><strong>P4</strong> \u2013 The splash turn says Maddie was kidnapped. Really? I thought nobody knew what happened to her. </p> <p><strong>P5 </strong>\u2013 Someone is described as an 'ex-pat'. At the very least that's amateurish. Look, let's make it really simple; if you don't know what a word means or how it's spelt, don't f***ing use it.</p> <p><strong>P6</strong> \u2013 The caption says 'rail-soaked' instead of rain-soaked. </p> <p><strong>P9</strong> \u2013 The conflict in Georgia provides us with some classic bollocks. What is a 'battle tank'? Does this mean wars now have referees who decide whether or not a tank is allowed to go into battle?</p> <p>Are all other tanks to be described as big metal cars for soldiers with a decorative gun on top? Also, what is a 'ground invasion'? Is that the one that comes after a sky invasion?</p> <p><strong>P11</strong> \u2013 Copy refers to 'heroine addict Boyd'. Disgraceful. This is one of the errors pointed out to the editor. There's also a reference to the LAPD. Not acceptable; do not assume everyone knows what it means.</p> <p><strong>P12</strong> \u2013 The feature about Princess Margaret's party paradise of Mustique says the island 'floats in a blue-green ocean'. No island, not even a super-duper one like Mustique, floats.</p> <p>There are then two examples of that patronising phrase 'of course': 'Colin Tennant knew, of course, that\u2026' and 'The world's press, of course\u2026.' Read the bloody stylebook and what it says about 'of course'. Finally, did we really need to tell readers twice that Margaret was the Queen's sister?</p> <p><strong>P14</strong> \u2013 The Focus starts with a name but again the surname is not capped up while the word taking the second drop cap is all lower case. Ahead of appears again and what the hell is an 'empty dwelling management order' when it's around?<br><strong><br>P16-17</strong> \u2013 The lead intro talks about the murder of a 'newlywed English couple in Antigua'. Since when has South Wales been in England? To make matters worse, the third par says the husband was flown home to Wales! For f***'s sake!</p> <p><strong>P18</strong> \u2013 The Fergie and Andy story says they're in the Scottish Highlands, probably to make clear they're not in the English, Welsh or Lithuanian bloody Highlands.</p> <p><strong>P21</strong> \u2013 The comment standfirst has the nonexistent word 'parenting' and 'spokesperson' in it. It names the piece's author as a bloke and then calls HIM a spokesperson. Utter sh*te.</p> <p><strong>P22</strong> \u2013 In the Ulrika Jonsson quote, what is a 'marrow fat pea'? </p> <p><strong>P23 </strong>\u2013 Virginia's lead talks about women working 'long hours in the office' and later tells us women are 'unhappy both in the office and in the home'. So, tough sh*t to the thousands of women who read our paper and don't work in an office.</p> <p><strong>P25</strong> \u2013 Neil Hamilton says: 'In 1908, the last London Olympics' organising committee\u2026' And there was me thinking the last one was the 1948 committee.</p> <p><strong>P30</strong> \u2013 At the end of the Dando story there's a reference to a 'master assassin' being captured. Earlier we'd been told how he failed to kill someone with FIVE bullets. Not so masterful then.<br><strong><br>P37</strong> \u2013 The game poachers story talks about 'organised' gangs cashing in on the culinary revolution sparked by celebrity chefs. Does that mean all the disorganised gangs are kicking themselves about their lack of a formal hierarchy then?<br><strong><br>P38</strong> \u2013 'Instalment' is spelt wrong. <br></p> <p><strong>P40-41</strong> \u2013 'Leading British male Tim Don.' NO, in the Sunday Express they're men or women. <br><strong><br>P45</strong> \u2013 Wellbeing is NOT hyphenated. What does 'confronted one of the them' mean? There is then a reference to Pope's Tower, where 'Alexander Pope lived and worked for two years'. Oh come on, you must know; that 17th-century poet who everyone is talking about in the pub.</p> <p><strong>P46 </strong>\u2013 The standfirst says: 'When a teenage concert hall worker snapped pictures of visiting bands, he had no idea that, 40 years on, his dusty collection would provide a valuable insight into Britain's musical golden age\u2026' No sh*t, Sherlock. That will be because, like the rest of us, he couldn't tell the sodding future.</p> <p>The copy mentions 'Britain's then vibrant live music scene'. Was that just after Britain's vibrant dead music scene then? Once again an idiotic use of the word live. There is mention of a picture showing the Beatles and Billy J Kramer having a laugh with Susan Maughan yet the picture on the page purports to show the Beatles and Billy J Kramer having a laugh with Elkie Brookes.</p> <p><strong>P48</strong> \u2013 The foreign lead has reopened and re-opened in the space of six pars. It's NOT hyphenated. The copy says Rockefeller's Chichester alias is connected to a double murder in Los Angeles, then says it's his Cross alias and then goes back to his Chichester alias.</p> <p><strong>P49</strong> \u2013 The Putin caption has the last word missing. <br><strong><br>P54</strong> \u2013 There is a reference to a 'stay-at-home mum'. No, it's mother. The copy constantly switches between calling the author by her first name and surname. The main caption names five people but there are six people in the picture.</p> <p><strong>P58</strong> \u2013 In the Eric Idle spread 'of course' rears its useless head yet again. What is this paragraph on about then: \"There's even a Bob Dylan-like character complete with guitar, harmonica and dark glasses who Idle plays himself. He comes in to help Brian talk about individuals,\" Idle explains. Eh?<br><strong><br>P60</strong> \u2013 Rehash is not hyphenated but it is in this copy. Later on we have '\u2026which may tie-in nicely with\u2026' That doesn't need a hyphen.</p> <p><strong>P61</strong> \u2013 Opera copy says 'around 30\u2026' No, it's ABOUT 30. <br><strong><br>P69</strong> \u2013 Copy refers to Liam Finn's dad and Natt Weller's dad but SX style is father. Abigail Hopkins is then quoted thus: \"I didn't have tonnes and tonnes of money.\" Do we know for a fact this woman talks in metric measurements then? F***ing ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>P83</strong> \u2013 The blurb for P86 refers to 'an historical tour'. No, that would be a historical tour.<br><strong><br>P84</strong> \u2013 Neil Hamilton writes: 'See Venice and die, the saying goes.' Er, no it f***ing doesn't, as our angry reader was quick to tell the editor.</p> <p>Stop writing this drivel and subs, stop letting it through.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The mood of excitement around the production staff and crew was palpable. Somebody had finally managed to talk national treasure and greatest living Englishman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/stephenfry\">Stephen Fry</a> into appearing as a relief captain on the whimsical, if spiteful, TV pop quiz Never Mind the Buzzcocks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338460943\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/10/09/jupitus220.jpg\" alt=\"Phill Jupitus\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phill Jupitus. Photograph: BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a treat for me personally as I have appeared on Stephen's panel show QI - another Talkback production - about a dozen times, and as such I'm fully aware of how much he knows about the world of pop music. Not to mention his sense of rhythm or ability to hold a tune. This was going to be fun. I was going to win. Oh yes, I was.</p> <p>My team consisted of Frankie Sandford from female pop group the Saturdays and heart throb du jour Dominic Cooper, still reeking of success from his silver screen turns in The History Boys and Mamma Mia. Stephen's team were the spaced-out Matt Schultz of Kentucky rockers Cage the Elephant and fabulous young comic Josie Long. </p> <p>It was interesting to observe the Fry effect in action. It would be foolish to suggest he's not aware that his Google-like breadth of knowledge isn't just a tad intimidating, so he goes out of his way to make those he works with feel at ease. I've done TV with some showbiz boffins who gleefully use their advanced intellect as a stick to beat you with. </p> <p>We convened for rehearsal, where we watch the video clips we'll be shown later and check that our exciting and trendy clothes don't strobe. Stephen and his team started cracking funnies as we sat there which made host Simon Amstell wheel round with a startled look: \"No, no, save it for the show!\" he yelped, and rightly so. Over the years I've seen an array of performers be fabulous at rehearsals, absolutely hysterical in the team room and positively own the make-up room before the show, only to lose all confidence in front of the cameras. But that wouldn't be happening tonight ...</p> <p>The show was a belter. The audience screeched with joy on discovering Stephen was to be this week's guest captain. We recorded for two-and-a-half hours and the mood stayed buoyant and convivial throughout. Simon had some very nice \"fake brainy banter\" material which Stephen played along with.</p> <p>As I watched, I realised that it's very difficult to have a bad TV show with Fry on board, hence his popularity. He straddles the twin worlds of entertainment and education like a chortling colossus and brings everybody around him and the audience into his singular world. Fry's interplay with the wonderfully dizzy Matt Schultz was priceless. Two men who had practically nothing in common gelled perfectly.</p> <p>As you might imagine, the crowning glory of the evening was when Stephen and Schultz stood up for their intros round. Stephen had written some quite detailed annotations of what he would be singing and his meaty hands pounded out the rhythm as he squeezed his eyes shut and tilted his head with concentration. It was perhaps the first time I ever saw Fry anywhere close to uncertainty in what he was doing, which of course made it compelling. Schultz flailed around hooting the melody, eventually mounting the desk with unbridled joy. </p> <p>As the longest serving member of the panel, it was gratifying to realise that you can be doing a job for 12 years and still be surprised and by what you see. Oh, and I let him win by the way.</p>",
