  "<p>Here is the winner of this week's No Shit Sherlock award: a prime example of the kind of film dead set on telling you what you know already. Like Oliver Hirschbiegel's supremely tiresome Das Experiment (2000), it transposes a real-life case from the United States to modern Germany, and it is fantastically shallow, fatuous, naive and obtuse. A liberal schoolteacher (J\u00fcrgen Vogel) tries to get his kids to understand what \"autocracy\" means with a role-play experiment: they get uniforms, quasi-military discipline, even a salute. Will things get revealingly out of control, do you suppose? The message is simply: gosh, you know, fascism could easily happen again - though this classroom-lab fascism appears to be of the PC sort that includes ethnic minorities - and the idea is insidiously premised on the assumption that fascism is not currently happening. Yet all over the world there are real tyrannies, real autocracies where human rights are trashed, real theocracies whose presidents deny the Holocaust: subjects, in fact, for a real film.</p>",
  "<p>An animator to rival Hayao \"Spirited Away\" Miyazaki, Yasutaka Tsutsui created this lightly bittersweet story of a schoolgirl called Makoto who discovers, if she has a long-enough run-up, that she can go backward in time. Makoto uses the ability as any child would: she resits exams, hunts down stolen puddings, embarks on marathon karaoke sessions. Most importantly, she attempts to hold her friendship with two boys in a status quo, undoing even the slightest sign of romance. The characters are entirely credible and likable, the simply drawn figures highly effective against the lush background artwork. Time travel has rarely seemed so joyous.</p>",
  "<p>The Groanbox Boys are an American folk-roots duo whose sound might be said to have melted down the melting pot. Banjo and guitar player Cory Seznec was born in Brittany and raised in Connecticut; his partner, Michael Ward-Bergman, graduated as a classical accordionist from Berklee College of Music before touring eastern Europe with a band of Romanian Gypsies. The album was written and recorded over the course of a week on a Maryland farm; the band did shifts with the crops and animals in return for permission to record in a barn. The result is an extraordinary mix of European and American folk styles - like Uncle Dave Macon dancing on the tables in a Parisian cafe with Django Reinhardt and Clifton Chenier riffing in the background. All the compositions except for the Appalachian murder ballad Little Sadie are originals, many featuring the \"Freedom Boot\", a large rod covered in bells and bottletops that is the band's signature, home-made rhythm stick.</p>",
  "<p>The blue-and-gold Europe golf bag lettered with the name of Padraig Harrington stood alone at the side of the tee box, awaiting the start of the practice round. No caddies, no coaches, no players. Just the bag. It was there for 10 minutes, sending a silent message to the watching US spectators: your opponents include the winner of the last two major tournaments. Look on his works, you Yanks, and despair.</p> <p>\"There's Paw-drayg,\" said a young man wearing wraparound shades, JB Holmes-lookalike moustache-and-goatee combo and a \"US Embassy, Kabul, Afghanistan\" baseball cap. \"He can hit it a mile,\" he added to a friend after the players finally appeared, before taking a gulp from his plastic beer glass. \"He wins 'em all. He beats Americans! Dammit, we're gonna KICK. HIS. ASS.\" </p> <p>Mind games are the stuff of the Ryder Cup build-up, with every tiny piece of circumstantial evidence endlessly examined for its possible significance. The enforced absence of Tiger Woods, the world's No1 player, thrusts Harrington, noted for his modesty, into a position of pre-eminence: the one on whom all the others keep an eye. It remains to be seen whether Nick Faldo, Europe's captain, can make the most of such a player's presence in his team room, or whether Paul Azinger, his opposite number, will use the absence of Woods to get the rest of the United States players, veterans and rookies alike, to treat the added responsibility as a challenge.</p> <p>Faldo, who is hoping to celebrate a fourth European triumph in a row, looks back to his playing days and remembers the 1981 tournament at Walton Heath, where the crushingly victorious US team contained 11 men who had won majors. Now Azinger is the first American captain in Ryder Cup history to go into battle at the head of a team without a single player who has won a major during the year. The role of favourites, however, can be as burdensome as that of underdogs can be stimulating, and it looks very much as though the tournament will be won by the team whose leader can tune himself in to the internal dynamics of his line-up and elicit the greatest advantage from a complex range of perceptions and expectations.</p> <p>Never in the history of the Ryder Cup has the pre-tournament debate been so dominated by the personalities of the two captains. Their predecessors have often provoked mild debate but this time Faldo and Azinger have virtually monopolised the build-up. Big characters are essential to the dramatic interest of any competition and, in the absence of Woods, the media spotlight has switched away from the players and on to two near-contemporaries with entwined destinies - from their occasional bitter personal rivalry during their playing days to their apparently amicable partnership in the television commentary box.</p> <p>Azinger has had the easier job. His good humour covers the hint of an inferiority complex lingering from his playing days and the US media do not question the motives of an engaging man who, while in his mid-30s, got the better of cancer. His decision to send six rookies to face Europe is applauded as a brave recognition of the need to erase the memory of past defeats, and his tilting of the side towards a kind of blue-collar golfing ethic embodied by the big-hitting Holmes seems calculated to strike a chord with the crowd who will line the course today. Should he fail to lead the side to victory, the reaction will be one of disappointment rather than scorn.</p> <p>His adversary is batting on a very different wicket. For all his late-blooming bonhomie and the arrival in his vocabulary of a Boris Johnson-like set of expostulations, including \"Cripes!\", \"Crumbs!\" and \"Gosh!\", Faldo cannot escape a past in which his great career as a six-times major winner was seen to be founded on an ironclad solipsism. Those who were around during his playing years find it hard to accept that his pursuit of Ryder Cup captaincy - with the \u00a31m or so that it brings - was impelled by anything other than that same self-centredness.</p> <p>A man of his achievements and temperament will always find it hard to sit quietly in the background, and it was tempting to conclude that when he described the make-up of the ideal Ryder Cup player this week - \"big heart, strong in mind and strong in battle\" - he was basing his template on the attributes of the player who is closest to his own heart.</p> <p>Criticised for moulding the team to suit his own needs, he has been teased and tested by the representatives of the British media in the days leading up to the tournament, most obviously when a photographer took a picture of a piece of paper that appeared to contain his pairings for the opening foursomes. As he attempted to laugh it off, his clumsy sarcasm reminded listeners that he is at his least amusing when he is trying to be funny. </p> <p>There are those who believe that, aside from the business of making speeches and supervising the design of the players' uniforms, a Ryder Cup captain's influence is overstated, and the blossoming of the likes of Sergio Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood in this environment certainly seems largely self-generated. But a bunch of individuals on one side or the other will need to perform to spectacular effect if, on Sunday night, the outcome of golf's premier team competition is not to be seen as the result of a straight fight between the minds and wills of two men whose strengths and weaknesses have been so thoroughly examined this week.</p>",
  "<p>If you live by the sword, then you know what to expect. However, after four championships in six years we won't change the way we think about rugby at Wasps. We will remain attack-minded. Some modification to meet the demands of a changed battlefield, however, is another matter.</p> <p>Attacking, with the ball or in defence, has served us well. On the honours board at Acton there are a couple of Heineken Cups and an Anglo-Welsh title to go with those championships. But after two losses in the Guinness Premiership this season, perhaps it's time to toe the line. We are one off the bottom of the table, with only one bonus point to show for 160 minutes of rugby, and when you are the reigning champions it is reasonable for people to ask: \"Why?\" As they say, it comes with the territory.</p> <p>You could argue that we could easily have had five points, which would have seen us handily placed and not far from where we wanted to be, but the real answer is that the game has changed and we possibly haven't changed our mindset enough. After six years of giving players their head, maybe it's time to ask for a bit more patience.</p> <p>You don't have to be a video analyst to see that the experimental law variations - the 13 ELVs - and with them the \"protocol\" issued to referees regarding the tackle and the contact area, have made attacking, particularly from deep, a high-risk game. Hence the amount of kicking everyone is doing.</p> <p>Sides don't want to chance their arm and play from their own half. They would rather kick and kick again, even if that means minutes of aerial ping-pong, until they get into a position to challenge for the high ball and the turnover which can give them control of the next six or eight minutes of the game, providing they don't contravene that protocol I mentioned earlier. </p> <p>It is about not allowing sides to seal off the ball in contact. It used to be a strength of the English game that referees were allowed to use some judgment about the tackle area, and most of them knew enough to know when a player was deliberately off his feet, denying quick ball to the opposition. Now anyone going off their feet, even if they have been pushed off balance by bodies flying into the ruck, gets a blast of the whistle.</p> <p>No matter that the tackler has not rolled away, that the ruck is hardly being contested or that a try may be in the offing - if you are deemed to have sealed off the ball, it's a penalty.</p> <p>The combination of aerial bombardment and stop-start rugby doesn't get the blood coursing through my veins, but in case that sounds like a moan I'll also own up and say that we have been beaten by sides that played better on the day. We have kicked poorly and given away too many penalties.</p> <p>Of course, we have been here before - last year we won one of our first six games and were bouncing along the bottom at Christmas. In part, that was because so many guys were at the World Cup. This time we had hoped for better, because of the agreement between the clubs and Twickenham that keeps our internationals away for nearly half a season, but also means that rest periods are built into their contracts.</p> <p>Still, regardless of all that, the inevitable tales of doom and gloom about Wasps are exaggerated. We simply have to get better, starting tomorrow at Northampton. </p> <p>Our domestic difficulties haven't blinded me to the fact that four men - three internationals and a budding Test player - have got off to a flying start under the new laws.</p> <p>Jonny Wilkinson had a stormer with the boot and in defence against Northampton, while Steve Borthwick has had two games of real authority for Saracens, ruling the lineout (despite its raft of new regulations) against Harlequins and Sale. Tom Croft has been in stand-out form for Leicester. But the back-row player who has really caught the eye is Steffon Armitage. </p> <p>Martin Johnson had already put the London Irish openside in the Saxons squad but he has stepped up this season, when the role of the \"fetcher\" is that much more important. He is no slouch as a ball-carrier either.</p>",
  "<p>The night before I meet Bette Midler I watch Beaches again for the first time in 15 years. There it all is: the smoking under the boardwalk, the seminal photobooth scene, the Christmas carols in the tiny flat, the row at the makeup counter (when Midler says to Barbara Hershey, \"You're jealous of my career\" and Hershey says, \"You only got your husband by default\" and Midler says, \"At least I own my life\"), the reconciliation, the vacation, and the swan song when Hershey, limp in a deckchair, is knocked stone dead by the condescension of Wind Beneath My Wings. Midler, vibrant in yellow, cackles and fluffs out. \"My God, it seems like such a long time ago. People still talk about it. It's either the worst chick flick or the best chick flick. Nothing in between.\"</p> <p>The career prospects of a sixtysomething female performer with professional pride have never been good, but at this point in history they are, says Midler, unprecedentedly awful. Hollywood tastes run to \"so much junk\"; the music industry bows to Disney's teenage \"Mouseketeer clones\". For those who don't want to pose naked under a sheet for Vanity Fair or compete for best supporting stereotype at the Oscars there is, in her opinion, only one course of action: to knock out a greatest hits album and haul ass to Vegas. </p> <p>In February, the 62-year-old started a two-year contract at Caesars Palace, the celebrity gulag where C\u00e9line Dion toiled unrelieved for five years. Midler alternates with Cher and Elton John, performing for 20 weeks a year, but while the others could have been hatched in Vegas, her appeal has always rested on her lack of pretension. Needs must, however, and Midler will go where the work is, just as she will protect her image via the necessary means. A few days before the interview, the Guardian picture desk is sent a set of lighting instructions for her photoshoot that look like the manual for the Hadron Collider. (We decline the shoot.)</p> <p>Her latest movie is a remake of George Cukor's 1939 classic The Women, in which Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell have been replaced by Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Eva Mendes. Midler has only a cameo, just as well since the film was described in the New York Times as a \"witless straining mess\". She doesn't look concerned. She looks like she always does, like someone on the brink of an amusing rebuttal. </p> <p>Midler's part took just two days to film, but the absence of any male actors - the film features only women - was instantly apparent in the atmosphere on set. \"I do love men, but you get that alpha-male, top-dog thing that is so tedious. It's like, 'Ach, go away'. We didn't have that.\" </p> <p>The remake is, she says, \"very funny. But you don't have the wacky perspective that you get from the old one. And Rosalind Russell was genius. Genius.\" (She doesn't speculate on Ryan's genius). I wonder what the all-male equivalent would look like and Midler explodes, \"They make those movies all the time! You just don't think of them that way because it's so common. All men and some robots. Those war movies. Stalag 17. The Bridge on the River Kwai. My God, there were no women in that David Lean film ...\"</p> <p>Lawrence of Arabia?</p> <p>\"Yeah. They always make movies with no women. How'd you like Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man? Walking around serving coffee? I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I said, 'Don't they know who this is?' I ought to be her agent.\"</p> <p>Midler grew up in Hawaii, but is associated with New York, which better suits her temperament. She left one for the other when she was 19 and never looked back, although she stayed in contact with her parents. \"I used to call on a Sunday, but they didn't expect me to come back. That's what you did then. When you left, you never went back. And they used to kick you out. You'd turn 18 and they'd say, 'OK, time's up.' Now they don't kick you out.\" She smiles. When her only daughter Sophie went to university, Midler and her husband kept her room exactly as it was. They hope she might move back. \"Or else we'll move in with her.\"</p> <p>Her parents were more distant - her father a house painter, her mother a housewife - and it's with sadness that Midler associates her own drive with her mother's, a woman whose life was \"small, as women's lives were then\". She was, she says, \"always too quick for the islands. Too busy and too energetic and I got it from her. She was capable of doing a lot of things quickly.\" Midler's mother named her after Bette Davis, and \"loved glamour. She didn't like drama. She didn't really want to be thrilled. She didn't like problems. She had enough problems of her own. She was a moviegoer in the old days, and then when she got to Hawaii they didn't have many movies. She was living on dreams.\"</p> <p>Hawaii is suddenly politically interesting, since it is where Barack Obama was raised. \"Isn't that fantastic?\" says Midler. Fifteen years his senior, her experience of Hawaii would have been very different - it wasn't even a state when she grew up, only a territory. \"I was in the sticks. Even the metropolis when I was a kid was very small and provincial. I remember the day after it became a state the cranes came to throw up the skyscrapers. Before that you weren't allowed to build higher than the Aloha Tower, the tower for the ships. We were in the land that time forgot when I was growing up. You grow up thinking the whole world is like this, and it's such a bring-down when you discover it isn't. Obama has made much better peace with it than I ever have.\"</p> <p>She'd like to campaign for him. \"I think he's smart, that's the key. I think he listens and absorbs and he processes and can come up with solutions. A lot of these people can't do that. A lot of them can't keep all the pieces in their minds.\" I ask what she considers to be the Hawaiian character. \"I think of it in two ways: full of laughter. Lots of laughs. And I think of it as quite violent. In communities where there are no jobs, it can be very violent. Not towards strangers, but towards each other.\"</p> <p>In 1980 Midler won an Oscar nomination for her lead in the Janis Joplin-inspired film The Rose, but she is often uncomfortably confined within roles too small for her. In The Stepford Wives, another terrible remake, she was the comedy ethnic neighbour, and between that and For The Boys, only The First Wives Club gave her any real rein. </p> <p>\"I wish I had had a different career,\" she says. \"I did things that I felt obliged to do at the time and I felt that I needed the security and the parts didn't come so quick and fast. Do I have any regrets? Yes and no. I don't think anyone in my position would have had any better luck than I had. I did about as well as I could have done. As well as they would let me. They are what they are. It's very rigid and nowadays it's even worse than it was.\"</p> <p>She says this with a sort of weary indignation. How are things worse now? \"Look at the movies that they put out. It's so junky. So much junk, it's like the food. No content. Nothing. If you're a performer like me the only thing you can do is [sing] live. They can't own you if you do live. So people of a certain age are back on the road, doing what they do well.\"</p> <p>She says she's over the disappointment. \"I made this picture called Jinxed! It was very hard to make, it was a big bomb and everybody blamed me. And I didn't work again for a couple of years. And that was very frustrating. I used to get upset. But those days are over. Now I look around and I see so few people my age working that I'm lucky,\" she says. \"It's all right to have twinges, but it's not all right to let it rule your life.\"</p> <p>Consequently, she takes a dim view of artists who are in demand and squander it. Amy Winehouse's talent thrills her and she is also appalled by her. She says, \"She has no history. She doesn't know where she could be standing in the continuum of singers. If she did, she wouldn't trash herself so. She'd have a little more self-respect. It's very sad. It really upset a lot of people.\"</p> <p>But it's a tradition in rock to self-destruct, isn't it? \"It's a waste of time. Such a waste. It's also a tradition to do good work up until the day you decide it's time to leave. Picasso worked until the day he died. Why aren't popular artists the same? Why are they so skimpy with their gifts?\" Maybe the demands of celebrity have got worse. She snorts. \"Hogwash.\"</p> <p>Midler's career was helped by the willingness of her husband to stay at home with their daughter. He's German and \"quietly, staunchly in the background. He's tremendous for me. A real rock. Because I had my daughter but I also had this gigantic other child. He took up all the slack.\" They met in a bar in LA where he was appearing as a performance artist and have been married for 23 years. \"I've been the breadwinner since we were married and he doesn't find that appalling. He loves to cook. We ate together every single day of my daughter's life. We took long holidays and tried to show her the world, from our crazy point of view. For a 21-year-old, she's very wise. And she's very kind. Which I think is important.\"</p> <p>Last year the family hired a van with some friends and went on a driving holiday around Britain. They went to garden centres and museums and pubs. \"Oh my God what a time we had. The food has gotten so much better. The food in the pubs? Sensational! You can tell 'em I said that.\" They even went to look around Highgrove. \"The whole bunch of us, all of us in the van. We somehow managed to get some PR person to let us in there. We were in the grove and we look up and there's the biggest, blackest helicopter. It was him. I was flipped out. It was so un-Charles to be in that helicopter.\"</p> <p>Midler is quite taken with royalty, mostly for its theatrical awfulness. She'd like to have met Wallis Simpson. \"Cos she was so wacky. Nutty as a fruitcake. But the whole thing was so nutty. A piece of history that doesn't quite compute. I read all the books. I'd like to have seen the clothes. The two of them were so beautiful, they would have been a great design team. But he probably would have been a terrible king.\"</p> <p>Most of the time Midler and her husband live in New York and lead a relatively quiet life, working on the Restoration Project she founded, which plans to plant a million trees in the city over the next 10 years and has already revitalised scores of community gardens. She is a big fan of the Slow Food movement, reads the New Yorker and then, every so often, disappears to Vegas for four weeks, where C\u00e9line Dion has advised her on how to fix the humidity in her dressing room. \"Very sweet girl. Hyper-emotional, but wonderful.\"</p> <p>There are worse fates in showbiz. \"I'll tell ya something. I like performing and I love making music. It's fun to be with musicians, to be the lead singer in a band. It's playing. I don't know why people have to torture themselves so.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Best Bette, featuring 18 Bette Midler classics, is released on Monday</p>",
  "<p>Greek opposition groups and trade unions promised yesterday to fight the conservative government's decision to liquidate and relaunch the country's national carrier, Olympic Airlines. </p> <p>Announcing a series of sit-ins, demonstrations and legal moves, unions pledged to fight \"a mother of all battles\" to stop the sell-off.</p> <p>Branding the plan a crime against the Greek people, opposition transport spokesman Nikos Sifounakis said: \"It is a huge mistake ... 6,500 employees stand to lose their jobs because the conditions of this scheme are so painful. We will give our support to all these protests.\"</p> <p>The restructuring of Olympic, which has been in the red almost since the shipowner Aristotle Onassis sold it to the Greek state in the 1970s, is seen as the cornerstone of the centre-right government's efforts to modernise one of Europe's most statist economies, and would end years of wrangling with Brussels.</p> <p>As the EU's last wholly state-owned airline, the carrier is believed to lose close to half a billion euros a year. Attempts by successive governments to privatise it have run up against the stiff resistance of employees linked to its 17 unions. </p> <p>Last night, Olympic's 490 pilots vowed to stage action. This year they began reading proclamations to passengers in mid-flight deriding the privatisation plans. </p> <p>Under the plan, Olympic will be closed with some assets being sold to a new private company, codenamed Pantheon, which will keep both its name and symbolic five-ringed Olympic logo. Two further companies will be created to assume control of the carrier's ground-handling and maintenance.</p>",
  "<p>For anyone wishing to get a snapshot of the British at play, The Proms in the Park is a good place to start. The moment the gates are opened, scores of middle-aged men and women make a frantic dash across Hyde Park, heroically refusing to let picnic baskets and magnums of champagne slow them down, in a bid to stake their claim on a patch of grass with a good view of the stage. Comedy jesters' hats adorned with Union Jacks are everywhere. Land of Hope and Glory, Jerusalem and Sir Terry Wogan are guaranteed to turn up sooner or later. But the songs of old England - those songs by forgotten composers once sung in pubs across the land - have been strangely absent from this celebration of all things British, until now. </p> <p>\"A lot of the songs in the English tradition are very sick,\" says Jon Boden, lead singer of 11-piece folk-jazz band Bellowhead, from the confines of the large white tent the band have been allocated backstage. \"We do one called Widow's Curse in which a woman gives herself an abortion by drinking boiling hot wine. English folk songs have a lot in common with Hammer Horror films.\"</p> <p>Despite adding such ghastly tales to their repertoire, the band are doing more to break traditional music out of its ghetto than anyone since Fairport Convention and Pentangle introduced folk songs to rock crowds in the late 60s. Bellowhead had only been together for a matter of months before they started winning awards and filling large venues. Now, five years on from their inception, they are about to perform before 30,000 people in Hyde Park, the vast majority of whom are guaranteed not to be familiar with their songs. Isn't playing the biggest event of the Proms nerve-wracking?</p> <p>\"I get much more nervous playing in pubs,\" says John Spiers, the band's squeezebox player, who took up life as an itinerant folkie soon after completing his masters in genetics at Cambridge. \"My dad is a morris dancer, so I get terrified playing in front of traditional musicians who'll pick me up on any mistake I make - and tell my dad about it.\"</p> <p>\"Some of us have struggled to play classical music and realised it's not for us,\" adds Pete Flood. \"I used to be principal percussionist in the Goldsmiths Orchestra. I was given a week to learn highly complex pieces like Neilson's 5th symphony with a snare drum cadenza, and then shoved on stage and forced to perform it next to Tasmin Little. It was a traumatic experience. After that, being in Bellowhead is nothing but a massive relief.\"</p> <p>Bellowhead came into existence through a pastime as thoroughly British as the Proms: sitting in a traffic jam. \"John Spiers and I were on our way to a gig in Cambridge about five years ago,\" says Jon Boden. \"We had been talking about the idea of forming a band with other musicians we knew for a while, and the longer we sat in the traffic, the more friends we thought of to ask to join the band. Then Oxford Festival asked us to do a gig before the band even had its first rehearsal.\"</p> <p>Spiers and Boden began life as Bellowhead with one rule: the material they performed would be old, mostly anonymously written English folk songs, but the tunes and arrangements would be their own. This decision was heretical to more conservative members of the folk community concerned with maintaining the unchanging purity of tradition, but indicative of a looser, more confident attitude to folk music in its younger enthusiasts. Some members of Bellowhead grew up with traditional English songs - bouzouki player Benji Kirkpatrick's father is the English singer John Kirkpatrick - others discovered them as teenagers, and others knew nothing about folk music until they joined the band. All they had in common was an enthusiasm for the shared experience of playing the songs. </p> <p>\"My background is in world music,\" says trumpet player Andy Mellon. \"I knew all about South African folk songs but I had never heard any of my own until I joined Bellowhead, which is quite odd if you think about it. It's still a huge learning curve for me.\"</p> <p>\"I got into it when I was 16,\" says violin player Paul Sartin. \"I would go to Cecil Sharp House [home of The English Folk Dance and Song Society] and be the only person there under 50. Now you go there on a Friday night and it's full of 18- to 21-year-olds drinking alcopops and trying to snog each other, which is how it should be. There's a new sex appeal to folk music. I'm not talking about Bellowhead, obviously.\"</p> <p>Behind the jollity that emerges when you have 11 musicians playing in a band that audiences can't seem to get enough of, there is one guiding principle: the importance of public ownership. In the liner notes of the band's second album, Matachin, a little bit of history is given on each song - Bruton Town features in Boccaccio's Decameron, Widow's Curse is a 17th-century broadside found in the Bodleian Library in Oxford - but no writing credits. These are songs that belong to everyone. </p> <p>\"Public ownership is a very serious thing to uphold,\" says Jon Boden, who appears to be the most serious-minded member of the group. \"Nobody gets upset if you do a version of a Joni Mitchell song, but in folk music there's this idea of the right way of approaching the material, as if there is such a thing as a definitive version of a song. Yet nobody owns these songs, or really knows how they would have sounded a couple of hundred years ago, or has the right to say how they should be approached. A composer like Vaughan Williams was criticised for writing his own arrangement to a folk song, but he was doing exactly what we're doing, which is to use existing melodies and take them somewhere. That's the prerogative of any musician.\"</p> <p>An hour or so later, the band are on stage before the most mainstream of British audiences, and it's strange to hear an obscure, anonymous song such as Fakenham Fair, about picking up a fortune teller and falling in love with her, just after the crowd have been singing along to Status Quo's Rockin' All Over the World. The band members appear to take it in their stride, though, just as they have the upward trajectory of their career so far. Given that their mission to bring folk songs back into the mainstream has so far been going so well, could the old, anonymous songs of a pre-industrial England be part of the national identity once again? </p> <p>\"Vaughan Williams tried to make that happen, getting folk songs played in schools and so on,\" answers Sartin. \"He was a community composer, and he got criticised for gentrifying this rural, working-class music when actually, he was arranging it in the way he knew for his contemporary culture. He was doing exactly what we are doing now, which is to celebrate music as a shared experience.\"</p> <p>\"If you really want to appreciate and support folk music,\" concludes Jon Boden, \"go to the local folk club. The first time you sit in a pub surrounded by people playing a tune, it's amazing. It's the feel that you get from folk music that counts, and that's the one thing we want to stay true to.\"</p> <p>\"It doesn't get better than standing in a pub with people singing all around you,\" concludes Paul Sartin. \"It sends a shiver up your spine.\"</p>",
  "<p>The drumming out of a man erroneously charged with advocating the teaching of creationism is surely an act of gross injustice (Leaders, September 18). The earlier decision of the Royal Society to distance itself from media misrepresentations of Professor Michael Reiss's clearly worded paper could have terminated a somewhat disreputable episode. Any perceived damage to the society's reputation might quickly have been dispelled if Professor Reiss's detractors had read his paper more carefully.

  "<p>Capitalism is imploding with the credit crunch, just as communism fell with the Berlin Wall in 1989, with both systems morally bankrupt. Successive British governments have sold off public assets and utilities at knockdown prices, leaving us defenceless against massive energy price increases. Politicians have engineered a disastrous housing boom and bust, with parliament allowing Blair-Brown and Bush their murderous $5tn Iraq war. And now corporate socialism is being extended by Brown at vast taxpayer expense to the predatory city bankers whose only value is that \"greed is good\", even while the same bankers are destroying HBOS through speculative short selling. This is a defining historic moment, with the collapse of light-touch, laissez-faire turbo-capitalism. </p> <p>So how can we the people reassert democratic power over our elitist parliamentary shamocracy? Reclaim a people's banking sector that serves society? And will your newspaper give space to inspiring and practical solutions that will help in the revision our democracy, economy and way of life? <br><strong>Martin Large</strong><br>Chair, Stroud Common Wealth Congratulations to Stephen Moss and Jon Henley for presenting the views of eminent people on the left about the current crisis (Crunch time, G2, September 17). But how bad does the collapse of neoliberal capitalism have to get before you bring left analysis out of the features section into the mainstream of news and analysis? For example, what sort of team have you sent to the European Social Forum starting now in Malm\u00f6?<br><strong>Michael Edwards</strong><br>University College London </p> <p>Your various prominent leftwingers trot out the usual tired idea of capitalism having failed and it being \"socialism's turn\" (I seem to recall it had a \"turn\" across much of the world in the last century - how do they think that turned out?). To suggest that we can do without capitalism is clearly ridiculous; you can refuse to recognise or organise markets, but they will come into being wherever there is trade, of even the most modest kind. And the moment you have a market, you will have those who seek to take advantage of it.</p> <p>No, the problems of recent weeks have been caused by a simple lack of regulation, from both governments and the financial industry itself. The basis of power in a capitalist system should lie, unsurprisingly, with whoever has the capital. The trouble is that nobody bothered, until it was too late for most, to check whether AIG, Lehman Brothers et al could actually produce the capital they were playing with when their investors demanded it. Recent administrations on both sides of the Atlantic have trumpeted their deregulation of the financial industries - if they announced they were disbanding the police, would anybody be surprised when crime shot up? </p> <p>A healthy system depends on restoring and maintaining the balance between the industry's drive to make money for its investors, and the regulatory bodies making sure they do not run roughshod over the rest of us. I hope that recent events are enough to motivate us to (re)construct that system.<br><strong>Simon Dennis</strong><br>London </p> <p>I thoroughly agree with the Green New Deal group. A crash programme to make every UK building energy efficient is just what our planet needs. If their green-collared \"carbon army\", recruited to do the job, was employed not by big business, but by local not-for-profit cooperatives, the concept would be far more socially responsible. Much better to regulate the market into funding a reduction in the cost of living for all.<br><strong>Bernard Rickman</strong><br>Purley, Surrey </p> <p>Thatcher's questionable \"privatisation\" of the TSB removed a local, safe and reliable vehicle for savings.

  "<p>The public finances suffered yet another lurch into the red last month amid warnings of a record deficit this year that would force the next government to raise taxes or cut spending - or possibly both.</p> <p>The overall shortfall between tax revenues and spending was \u00a310.2bn in August - the worst figure for that month since such records began in 1993. Economists said the deficit could reach \u00a370bn this financial year, double the 2007/08 figure and way above the \u00a343bn estimate the chancellor, Alistair Darling, made in the budget in March.</p> <p>A deficit of \u00a370bn would easily exceed the previous record of \u00a351bn set by the Conservative government of Sir John Major in 1993. For the April to August period, the deficit was running \u00a312bn higher than in the same period last year - at \u00a328bn. </p> <p>The national debt figures lurched higher as the government's nationalisation of Northern Rock's \u00a387bn debt came onto the books for the first time, pushing debt up to 43.3% of national income, well above the government's self-imposed 40% ceiling.</p> <p>Excluding Northern Rock, the benchmark stood at 38.3%. The Treasury is reviewing its two main fiscal rules - the second being that tax should cover current spending over an economic cycle. Both are likely to be broken even if the impact of Northern Rock is removed.</p> <p>The government's problem will be exacerbated by the downturn in the economy. Figures out on Wednesday showed the biggest rise in unemployment for 16 years in August, which will push down income tax receipts and increase benefit payments, pushing the deficit out still further.</p> <p>The \u00a32.7bn cost of unwinding the 10p tax debacle, the postponement of fuel duty rises and the temporary scrapping of the starting rate of stamp duty for house purchases will all push up the deficit, as will the housing market collapse.</p> <p>This week's 4,500 job losses at Lehman Brothers, added to other City job losses, are particularly bad news for the public finances because bankers pay a lot of income tax, analysts pointed out.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics said: \"The state of the public finances continues to go from dreadful to even worse. If this rate of increase is sustained, borrowing will hit \u00a370bn this year.\"</p> <p>The figures show the government is struggling to control spending growth at a time when tax revenues are weakening.</p> <p>Andrew Goodwin, an economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, said: \"If recent trends are sustained, borrowing would reach \u00a364bn for the year as a whole. And with the economic outlook likely to worsen over the coming months there is a good chance that the out-turn could be even worse.\" </p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said the chancellor's predictions had been \"well and truly blown out of the water\".</p> <p>The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, said: \"Gordon Brown has built our economy on a mountain of public and private debt, leaving Britain poorly prepared in the face of the current economic crisis. His fiscal rules are now totally discredited. </p> <p>\"This is yet more evidence of why we need a new fiscal framework to bring the public finances back under control - and a new government to implement it.\"</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Faced with unprecedented world shocks, it is right that we increase borrowing this year to help support the economy. </p> <p>\"We are cutting taxes by over \u00a34bn for low and middle income families, and maintaining public sector investment to help families and the economy through these tougher times.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Hutton, the business secretary, is to fast-track a change in the law to facilitate the merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS. On October 6, the day parliament returns, he intends to lay an order in the House of Commons to change the wording of section 42 of the 2002 Enterprise Act so the merger need not be referred to the Competition Commission.</p> <p>At present referrals can only be blocked if they affect national security or the plurality of media ownership. The new regulation will extend this on public interest grounds to ensure the stability of the UK financial system.</p> <p>The government, after taking advice from the Treasury, Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, has decided that it does not require a new bill to change the law but can pass an order to alter a section of the act.</p> <p>According to government whips, if no one in parliament objects to the change, it may be possible to get the regulation passed in one day.</p> <p>MPs and peers will be asked to convene a meeting of the Statutory Instruments Committee to debate and scrutinise the order. If the committee agrees to the order, it can be placed before the Commons at the end of the first day and become law immediately.</p> <p>The government has framed the order so it does not even need a vote by MPs to become law but can be nodded through. If an MP objects, however, the change will be delayed and there will have to be a debate on the floor of the Commons.</p> <p>So far David Cameron, the Tory leader, has pledged not to oppose the change in the law - so the government should be able to get the measure through without any problems.</p>",
  "<p>Prisoners in British jails should be allowed to vote and the government should enact legislation to that effect, according to a United Nations report. The call was welcomed yesterday by prison reform groups.</p> <p>In its latest report on civil rights in the UK, the UN human rights committee has expressed concern that British prisoners do not have the vote and stated that \"the general deprivation of the right to vote for convicted prisoners may not meet the requirements\" of the UN's human rights covenant. Now pressure is to be put on the government to come into line with the majority of EU countries that allow inmates to vote.</p> <p>Currently, convicted British prisoners are not entitled to vote, a ban that dates back to the Forfeiture Act of 1870. Many European countries, including Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands, give all their prisoners the right. In some countries, such as France and Spain, judges can impose the loss of voting rights as an additional punishment. Britain is one of only nine European countries, including Russia, Bulgaria and Romania, where all convicted prisoners are banned; in the UK, remand prisoners retain their right to vote.</p> <p>\"The UK ban on prisoners voting is a relic from the 19th century which is neither a deterrent nor an effective punishment,\" said Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, yesterday. \"The right to vote poses no risk to public safety. Giving prisoners the vote would encourage them to take the responsibilities that come with citizenship.\" </p> <p>Lyon added that it would also encourage politicians, particularly those with large prisons in their constituencies, to take more of an interest in penal policies.</p> <p>The European court of human rights ruled in 2004 that a blanket ban was in violation of the European convention on human rights. The ruling followed an action brought by former prisoner John Hirst. \"Until now there have been no votes in jails and so MPs did nothing about penal reform,\" he said at the time, explaining his reasons for mounting the legal challenge.</p> <p>In June this year, Bridget Prentice, the parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Justice, was asked about the extension of voting rights to prisoners but would only say that any changes in the law would have to be \"considered in the context of the wider development of policy on the franchise and the rights that attach to British citizenship\". </p> <p>She added that the government would carry out a \"more detailed public consultation on how voting rights might be granted to serving prisoners\". The MoJ said yesterday that no date had yet been fixed for such a consultation exercise. Lyon accused the government of dragging its feet and said: \"It is disappointing that a government committed to social inclusion has failed to enfranchise all its citizens.\"</p> <p>In terms of numbers, the British prison population of approximately 83,000 constitutes what could be a significant voting bloc. If prisoners were enfranchised, they would either be allowed to vote in their home constituencies, in the same way as students, or in the constituency where their prison was. This would raise the intriguing possibility that in a place such as, for instance, the Isle of Wight, which has a high concentration of prisons, the inmates could actually become a crucial voting bloc, able to swing a seat one way or the other.</p> <p>It is unclear which way the majority would vote or if they would vote at all. The Labour party, which has substantially increased the numbers of inmates since it came to power in 1997, seems an unlikely recipient of votes, although the Conservative plan to provide another 5,000 prison places may not be any more popular. </p> <p>However, the Conservatives could argue that no other party has had two of its most senior members recently behind bars and that they are therefore best able to identify with the problems inmates face.</p>",
  "<p>The government yesterday claimed success in its war on hospital infections with news that cases of the superbug MRSA had halved between 2004 and 2008.</p> <p>While the Tories accused the government of moving the goalposts, Gordon Brown wrote to all healthcare staff to thank them for their efforts. He admitted that some of the imposed initiatives, from the deep-cleaning of wards to the recent bare-below-the-elbows policy had been controversial, but he told staff: \"I am pleased that they have helped you make the progress that you have.\"</p> <p>The official figures came from the Health Protection Agency, which collects reports both of MRSA and Clostridium difficile infections. In the past, both results have been announced together, but for the first time yesterday, the MRSA figures were declared a month ahead of C difficile - a bug which is harder to deal with.</p> <p>The Department of Health denied any spin, saying it had asked the agency to release results as soon as they were available. The C difficile results are expected next month.</p> <p>The HPA's quarterly report on MRSA shows 836 cases between April and June 2008, a 14% decrease on the previous three months and a drop of 36% from the same quarter last year. The government says that since 2004, MRSA infections have now dropped by 57%.</p> <p>Peter Borriello, director of the agency's centre for infections, warned that continued attention was needed. \"The next challenge will be to move to a position of zero tolerance,\" he said.</p> <p>The Healthcare Commission said the figures represented a big success. \"Infections like this are not easy to control and they have had a real hold on hospitals,\" said Anna Walker, the chief executive. \"The personal cost has in too many cases been terrible.\"</p> <p>She said there were still variations in performance among trusts, and MRSA was only one of the hospital infections that could harm patients.</p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Johnson, said he was not complacent. \"Hand hygiene, high standards of cleanliness, bare below the elbows, deep clean of hospitals and screening patients for MRSA are all vital elements of our strategy; so too is sensible use of antibiotics. But now we are looking increasingly towards technology and design in the fight against infection.\"</p> <p>Seven \"showcase\" hospitals were testing innovative products to reduce and prevent infections.</p> <p>The Tory health spokesman, Andrew Lansley, said Labour cared more about spin than rooting out hospital infections. \"It's telling that they changed the publication date of MRSA statistics for political gain, that they have only met their MRSA target by moving the goalposts and that the best they could come up with to tackle this massive problem has been gimmicks like Gordon Brown's deep cleaning programme.\"</p>",
  "<p>President Robert Mugabe and his political rivals have been unable to agree on how to share key cabinet posts, an opposition spokesman said yesterday, in a sign that bitter divisions threaten the power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe. Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change said a meeting of party leaders broke up with no resolution and deputies had been asked to keep negotiating.</p> <p>Mugabe's Zanu-PF \"is claiming all the powerful ministries,\" Chamisa said. \"That is why there couldn't be agreement and it's being referred back to the negotiators.\" He said ministries in contention included home affairs, which directs the police who have been accused of political violence. Mugabe remains military commander-in-chief, so the opposition is likely to insist on control of at least some security forces. Other disputed ministries were foreign affairs, finance and local government.</p> <p>Chamisa said Mugabe, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and the leader of a smaller opposition faction, Arthur Mutambara, would meet again when the president returns from a UN general assembly meeting next week.</p> <p>Yesterday's talks were the first since the signing on Monday of the unity government deal in which Mugabe ceded some power for the first time in 28 years. The agreement provides for 31 ministers, 15 to be nominated by Mugabe, 13 by Tsvangirai and three by Mutambara. </p>",
  "<p>As a sub-prime mortgage lender, Richard Bitner has not done too badly. He lives in a huge mock Tudor house in a wooded suburb on the edge of Dallas, complete with miniature turrets, an oversize fireplace and wood-panelling. But he is a little bit, shall we say, tortured.</p> <p>Bitner was co-founder and president of Kellner Mortgage Investments, a firm which specialised in providing high-risk loans of the sort that triggered America's mortgage meltdown and credit crunch. Now out of the game, he compares himself to a drug dealer, acknowledging that his trade has achieved pariah status in the public eye.</p> <p>\"I almost look at the mortgage industry kind of like the drug trade. Wall Street and the investment banks are the Bolivian drug lords,\" he says. \"You look at this and you go: What were we doing? Who doesn't want the feeling of euphoria? Who doesn't like to get money?\"</p> <p>He continues: \"Wall Street, the drug lords, were creating this product. Lenders and brokers are the street dealers who were largely making it available based on a consumer desire; a want for it.\"</p> <p>A trim, bearded 41-year-old with a small medallion on a chain around his neck, Bitner has lifted the lid on the mortgage industry's excesses in a book called Confessions of a Subprime Lender which is packed with tales of crooked brokers, deceitful customers, avaricious Wall Street banks and all too obliging credit rating agencies. Thanks to appearances on television discussion shows across the US, he is becoming the human face of a loathed industry.</p> <p>He reckons his firm, which peaked with 65 employees, put him at the level of a mid-ranking narcotics fiend: \"I'm probably the guy who is in the city distributing it to all the people on the corners, and it is ultimately going to the consumer - the wholesaler.\"</p> <p>Across the US, an estimated 2.5 million people are in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure this year as a result of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Bitner's description of day-to-day business at Kellner is an eye-watering glimpse of the industry's slide into anarchy. </p> <p>His company was in effect a middle man, taking applications from independent brokers and providing them with loans funded by big finance houses, then selling the finished articles on to Wall Street for securitisation.</p> <p>Bitner bankrolled Kellner's creation by persuading his parents to mortgage their house in 2000 and he stayed in the game for five years, watching the types of loans on offer from financial institutions get steadily riskier.</p> <p>Dishonesty became endemic in loan applications. By the end, Bitner reckons that 70% of submissions to the company from brokers were deceptive. Properties, supposedly objectively appraised, were spectacularly overvalued. He estimates that half of loans were on homes over-egged by up to 10%, a quarter had prices exaggerated by 11% to 20% and the rest were \"so overvalued they defied all logic\".</p> <p><strong>Tricks</strong></p> <p>\"The industry lost its mind,\" says Bitner. \"It went from borderline stupid to downright insane.\" The notion of \"acceptable risk\" simply went out of the window: \"I watched the margins compress in the industry and I realised no one was providing for the risks.\"</p> <p>In his book, Bitner recounts a seemingly endless list of tricks used by brokers to push dubious loans. Many simply withheld information, such as the fact that a homebuyer was getting an additional loan to pay for a deposit or that a couple, buying on the basis of joint income, were actually planning to divorce. Others would manipulate figures by knocking up ersatz payslips using desktop publishing programs.</p> <p>\"I don't want to say I became desensitised to it, but it gets to a point that you feel like you can't trust anybody,\" says Bitner. \"I've always operated from the perspective that I'll give anyone the benefit of the doubt until they prove me wrong, but I've gotten to a point in business where I've become a little more jaded.\"</p> <p>Members of the public were urged to stick to one broker rather than shopping around because each broker would check their credit record, and, through the sheer fact of being officially checked, fragile credit scores often fall. In one case, Bitner recalls that a loan came across his desk for a single family residence, depicted in a blurred long-distance photo. On closer inspection, it turned out to be part of a multi-occupancy office park. </p> <p>The industry was barely regulated: in Texas, mortgage salespeople had to be sponsored by a registered broker. Bitner describes how 250 different loan officers were attached to a single one-man office measuring about 1 square metre, with licences pinned to every surface. </p> <p>\"There was a tremendous amount of ignorance. The entire industry - brokers and lenders - are largely looking to the guidelines that are being brought to us from up above, from Wall Street, to say this is an acceptable level of risk,\" he says. </p> <p>Fast-talking, articulate and animated, Bitner blames the fragmented nature of mortgage lending for the industry's dramatic fall to earth. Like a drug ring, he says a hierarchical structure allowed players to continue passing on risk at a faster and faster pace, without anybody pausing for thought.</p> <p>\"It used to be one bank that did everything [on a loan]: underwrote it, securitised, wrote on it, foreclosed on it,\" he says. \"Securitisation allowed us to break it up into so many components where nobody in the chain really had a strong, vested, monetary interest in how that bond performed over time except for the bondholders.\"</p> <p>He reserves his greatest ire for credit rating agencies that continued to attach high marks to packages of high-risk mortgages until the mortgage market had begun to collapse in 2007. \"The rating agencies were supposed to be the independent arbitrators, the umpires. But the only referee in this entire match is largely dysfunctional; it might as well have been sitting on the sidelines drinking a fifth of gin and tonic.\"</p> <p>As a sub-prime lender, Bitner accepts that he was far from blameless. He was, at times, knowingly marketing unrealistic loans. Bitner viewed one common product, providing 95% finance to people with ultra-low credit scores, as \"absurd\". But he defends the principle of sub-prime lending and maintains that in his five years he did more good than harm. </p> <p><strong>Gratifying</strong></p> <p>\"My job felt amazingly gratifying. I don't think I've ever felt as gratified in work that I did. You are seeing loans that are performing. You are seeing people who would not otherwise qualify.\"</p> <p>Yes, he admits, things ran badly out of control and everybody - from consumers to brokers, lenders, banks and the Federal Reserve - shares responsibility. But he insists that underlying intentions were sound: \"There's something very empowering about this business. It's helping those people who are trying to achieve the dream of home ownership. Or, forget about the dream, they're just trying to get their family into a house. Why is that such a bad thing, if we can manage the risk?\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 41</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Katella high school in Anaheim, California; Northern Arizona University; masters degree in communication from Cornell University</p> <p><strong>Employment </strong>Worked for mortgage, insurance and finance companies including EquityLink Financial, GE Capital and GMAC Residential Funding before co-founding sub-prime lender Kellner Mortgage Investments in 2000; left in 2005 and now works for an online news provider, HousingWire</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married with two sons</p> <p><strong>Hobbies</strong> Scuba diving; supporting the Dallas Cowboys football team</p>",
  "<p>I have had a really jolly week. I know: weird or what? Frankly, if you saw anyone this week with a smile on their face, they had probably just been to a fashion show. While the rest of you have been watching gloomy-faced bankers on the news and wondering whether one of them siphoned off your pension into his 1998 bonus, leaving you to face penniless old age while he purrs into the sunset in the Jag he bought with your cash and whines about no longer having a driver, I have been looking at pretty clothes in lovely colours and listening to feelgood nostalgia classics, from the Jungle Book's I Wan'na Be Like You at Christopher Kane to LL Cool J's I Need Love at David David.</p> <p>The upbeat mood at London fashion week is all the more strange because last time around, in February, it could not have been more different. Then, the designers were into references such as medieval armour or witches or science-fiction horror. Sitting in the front row as the models came marching along, chainmail clanking menacingly against their jutting bones, I felt as if I was witnessing the onslaught of the horsemen of the apocalypse, only these ones travelled on platform spike-heeled gladiator boots rather than horses. Fashion seemed to be knuckling down for gloomy times ahead. But seven months later, in the very week that doom-mongering turned into reality, the mood was all smiles. </p> <p>If there is an overarching theme to be teased out of this week's shows, it is that this season, the mid-1980s to mid-1990s retro trend finally grew up and got wearable. Nostalgia for this era is nothing new in fashion - for the thirtysomethings currently populating London's design studios, these years were their teenage heyday. Hoxton clubbers have been dressing as if for a fashion shoot in a 1986 issue of The Face for years. But this week, the look took on a new commercial gloss. I suspect there is an element of escapism at play here. Now that they are stuck at work frowning over Excel spreadsheets, a generation is beginning to hone and polish its nostalgia for the days of Tetris games, acid house and Ray-Bans.</p> <p>Giles Deacon performed a radical about-turn from last season's portentous capes with a rainbow-coloured collection inspired by the Pacman obsession of his early teens and featuring a tongue-in-cheek double-G logo. Luella meshed 80s high society and pop culture: Tatler bows and pearls worn with Madonna-esque lace gloves and grey marl sweatshirting from the days when Pineapple dance studio was a hip hangout and yoga classes were for old hippies. Luella's cocktail dresses came in Tango orange, lipstick pink, candied violet - or, in some cases, all three. Richard Nicoll, Roksanda Ilincic and Sinha-Stanic all used brilliant colour in a clean, elegant way that somehow made teaming pink with orange or lime seem the height of chic. Temperley zeroed in on pink and electric blue, but orange was the unignorable colour of the season - from Christopher Kane's Flintstones-meets-Raquel Welch chiffon frocks to Jaeger and Betty Jackson's easy summer pieces to Amanda Wakeley's red-carpet looks. Natascha Stolle, a promising newcomer to the London schedule who scored a coveted spot on the Fashion East roster this season for her take-no-prisoners aesthetic of primary stripes against monochrome, was inspired \"by the 1980s glamour of her mother's Honolulu wardrobe\". </p> <p>The must-have shoes for next season? The slick purple patent Bayswater high-heeled loafers and mustard-yellow Roxanne sandals from Mulberry. (In her first collection, new Mulberry designer Emma Hill, alumna of Marc by Marc Jacobs and Gap, has given you shoes to match the spirit of your favourite Mulberry bag.) I think it's safe to say that colour is most definitely happening next summer. So much so, in fact, that even designers who remained aloof from the prevailing trend-silliness embraced colour. Now that bright orange and pink-with-lime are fashion-forward, the lemon-yellow that seemed so daring a year ago has become the summer colour of grown-ups: see the checked coatigan at Paul Smith and the mini-mac at Nicole Farhi. </p> <p>The right mood gets more style points than the right references, though. Louise Goldin, London's avant-garde knitwear star, seemed to mesh Tetris graphics with the Gaultier conical bras of Madonna's 1990 Blonde Ambition tour in this season's body-conscious dresses. And yet in a season that was all about clothes to make you smile, this collection felt a little too clinical. These are sexy dresses that could have been designed with latex gloves on: they lack a little human warmth. </p> <p>Topshop Unique had the right idea. In the past, this has sometimes been an oddly po-faced show, rather conceptual and serious and strangely at odds with the fashion-as-fun philosophy that Topshop is all about. This one brought to mind Kelly McGillis in Top Gun, and Madonna circa Like a Virgin - heart-print jumpsuits, aviators and wonky bows in the hair. Jumpsuits and playsuits will be completely unavoidable next year, from loose, dayglo and short at Marios Schwab to flowing, full-length bird-printed chiffon at Jaeger. The halterneck jumpsuit is next summer's maxidress, mark my words. </p> <p>The vintage-era Madonna influence made itself felt in another micro-trend: dresses on which integral bra-straps were a feature. At Louise Goldin's show, what looked like a dress from the front was a skirt and bra top from the back; at Richard Nicoll, coordinating silk bras were layered under racer-back vests. (Forensic fashion watchers will wonder whether the Sex and the City movie, in which Carrie wore a contrasting bra with a backless dress, played a role in this trend.)</p> <p>The bad news? Cycling shorts are back. But if we can smile through global financial meltdown, surely we can laugh in the face of lycra-clad thighs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>All the latest news, reviews, gossip and pictures from the catwalks of the capital <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/fashion\">theguardian.com/fashion</a> Sign up to Fashion Statement, the Guardian's free new email service, for updates on fashion, catwalks and new trends, and the chance to win a trip to New York.</p> <p><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/fashionstatement\">theguardian.com/fashionstatement</a></p>",
  "<p>The 37th Ryder Cup starts today in Kentucky, and last week, as the world's top golfers made their final preparations, the personal effects of one of the game's most singular talents were briefly on display in Carlisle. At Home With the Flitcrofts told the surreal life story of the late Maurice Flitcroft, self-styled \"Golfer Extraordinary\", and while it is a shame that the show passed completely under the radar before it closed, this somehow seems apt. For Maurice was the golfer who went undetected by officials at the 1976 Open championship, competing in golf's grandest tournament despite never having played a round in his life.</p> <p>Maurice became headline news that day, carding a round of 121, the worst in Open history. His story didn't end there. For the next 14 years, he would engage in a farcical game of cat-and-mouse with Keith Mackenzie, secretary of the R&amp;A, golf's governing body, and a man whose constitution appears to have been 10% flesh, 10% blood and 80% rulebook. The humourless Mackenzie felt humiliated by Flitcroft's antics in 1976 and banned him sine die - so Maurice simply entered again and again, employing ludicrous pseudonyms such as Gerald Hoppy, James Beau Jolly, Count Manfred von Hofmannstal and Gene Paychecki. Usually the denouement would feature Flitcroft being chased from the course, but by the time that happened the battle had already been won.</p> <p>Flitcroft's tale would be amazing as it stands, yet At Home With the Flitcrofts somehow managed to embellish it further by covering the antics of his twin sons, Gene van Flitcroft and James Harlequin Flitcroft, whose scrapes include caddying for Lee Trevino, winning the 1984 World Disco Dancing championship, and becoming proud recipients of the UK's first-ever anti-social behaviour injunction. For swordfighting. Each other. Whatever unfolds at Valhalla this weekend, it will have nothing on this.</p> <p>The show's centrepiece was the battered red armchair from which Maurice wrote his many letters requesting Open entrance forms. \"Gene and James are pleased their dad's chair is in the exhibition,\" artist and photographer Karen Storr, the show's curator, told me. \"They were about to get evicted and were wondering how they were going to move it.\" </p> <p>Gene and James were sadly absent when I arrived, having received their dole money a couple of days before, and and were presumed off enjoying some cold refreshment. They did, however, manage to make the opening of the exhibition the previous week. Just. \"On the way they were thrown off a train for smoking fags and trying to steal other people's packed lunch,\" explains Trevor Kirkwood, who is here to assist Karen, has known the twins since school, and was also a \"dear friend\" of Maurice. \"You know the Gallaghers off Shameless?\" he asks. \"They're very tame compared to those two.\"</p> <p>The red armchair was also where Flitcroft penned his unpublished memoir, which had three working titles: The Golfer Who Tried, The Artful Golfer, and, most deliciously, The Phantom of the Open. It's a hilarious, tinder-dry document of his efforts to become Open champion - for he was not partaking in gonzo pranks like, say, Karl Power, who once famously lined up for a team photo alongside Manchester United against Bayern Munich. \"He totally, absolutely thought he could win the Open,\" says Trevor. \"He was deadly serious. He put his heart and soul into it. He wanted to prove himself as a person.\"</p> <p>By trade Maurice was a crane driver from Barrow-in-Furness, but this did not satisfy his artistic ambitions. He turned his hand to painting, knocking out some half-decent Picasso and Pollock pastiches. He tried songwriting. And at one point he toured with a comedy theatre troupe as an acrobatic stunt diver. But golf would become his true calling. \"In the summer of 1974 I became interested in fell walking,\" he wrote. </p> <p>\"I bought some maps and books on the subject and a compass, suitable walking boots and socks. On one trip to the fells I bought myself a red jungle hat. It wasn't long before I was contemplating taking up mountain climbing. But I took up golf instead, which, in my case and the Open championship, could fairly be said to amount to one and the same thing. \"</p> <p>Flitcroft had fallen in love with the sport after watching the 1974 World Match Play Championship on television. \"They introduced the players individually, showed them teeing off, and there was this exciting theme tune, boom ba de boom, ba de boom. I thought it was great and I remember thinking how marvellous it would be to be a part of it.\" </p> <p>In less than two years he was, taking his inspiration from a Milwaukee postal sorter called Walter Danecki. \"Walter wished to become a professional golfer but was thwarted by the USPGA and their narrow-minded insistence on evidence of playing ability,\" wrote Maurice. Undaunted, Danecki simply announced himself to the R&amp;A as a professional and entered the 1965 Open, shooting a two-round total in qualifying of 221, which Maurice noted \"was 70 too many to earn him a place in the championship field\". Buoyed by this example, Flitcroft followed Danecki's path in 1976, and successfully applied for Open qualifying at Formby.</p> <p>Having got lost on the way to the course, he arrived with no time to practise. \"My drive off the first tee was a real high-flying disappointment,\" he wrote. \"I swung the club mightily and let fly. It was not a total disaster. It could have gone straight up, come down and hit an official on the head, but it didn't, I'm glad to say. It did sail high into the air, in a forward direction, but only for a short distance.\" The pattern of the day set, he put his next shot into a thicket. After another 119 shots plus an argument with an official for slow play, his Open dream was all over: having calculated that he would need to shoot 23 the next day to qualify, he decided to bow out gracefully. Still, Flitcroft's 49-over-par round made him front-page news, sending his nemesis Mackenzie into a funk of such intensity that Flitcroft found himself immediately banned for life from all R&amp;A courses.</p> <p>Refusing to acknowledge defeat, he managed to enter again in 1984 as \"Swiss professional\" Gerald Hoppy, taking 63 shots over nine holes before being hauled off the course, and again in 1990 as Gene Paychecki from the US. Stopped by an official when three over par after two, he was again rumbled, partly because, as Kirkwood explains, \"he couldn't do the accent\". Flitcroft even challenged Mackenzie to a game at St Andrews to prove his worth, but the offer was turned down. \"He loathed Mackenzie, couldn't stand him,\" says Kirkwood. \"But what really rankled was the bad publicity. He thought he was a good golfer. In later years, he acknowledged that he wasn't, but he never thought of himself as a failure.\"</p> <p>Gene and James, meanwhile, were doing their own bit to advance the Flitcroft brand. Dad's name being mud with the R&amp;A, Gene's fledgling career as a caddy was fraught; he claims to have once caddied for Lee Trevino in the mid-1980s, throwing officials off the scent by changing his name to the delightfully understated Troy Atlantis, though it would prove a dead end. James was busy elsewhere, winning the 1984 World Disco Dancing Championship. That success came a good half-decade or so after disco had lost its lustre, but James did his best to inject some glamour back into a dying scene: he triumphed under the pseudonym Paris Ventura.</p> <p>The jumpsuit James wore that day, a central piece of At Home With the Flitcrofts, has a 22-inch waist, but both twins have since gone somewhat to seed in a haze of booze. Having picked up their Asbi prizes for swordfighting, (the powers-that-be having little truck with Gene's claim to have once been a regional fencing champion), their last brush with fame was an appearance in 2007 on the Trisha TV show under the banner \"I Hate My Twin\". On the show, James claimed to have slept with 375 women, then revealed he once had his leg broken in a golf-club duel with Gene. \"I missed him, he was too quick, he's an ex-boxer,\" explained James with sibling pride.</p> <p>\"The lads have tried to outdo Maurice, it's been their downfall,\" says Karen, acknowledging that bleak farce does not obscure personal tragedy. But the legacy of Maurice Gerald Flitcroft, who died last year aged 77, cannot be tainted. In 1988, the Blythefield Country Club in Michigan named a tournament in honour of his efforts, and invited him over to play. His recollection of the round sums up all that is great about the man. \"On the par-three 11th, prizes were being awarded for getting close to the flag,\" wrote Maurice. \"First prize was $50, not an easy prize to win as the elevated green was guarded in front by two huge bunkers separated by a narrow strip of grass. It was on this narrow strip that I put my tee shot. To my surprise I was given a $10 voucher.</p> <p>\"I thought at the time that this gesture of generosity was accorded to me because I was the guest of honour. But on reflection it may have been for landing my ball on the aforementioned strip, no mean achievement as this was a much smaller target than the green.\"</p> <p>In the face of yet another high-flying disappointment, Maurice Flitcroft just kept on trying.</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, now on television in a new adaptation, sprang in part from Hardy's reaction to the case of Martha Brown, hanged in 1856 for the murder of her abusive husband. Novels have often served to fix our image of legal processes: think of Dickens's condemnation of the chancery court in Bleak House, or Fielding's satire on 18th-century criminal justice in novels like Tom Jones. In Tess, Hardy gave us an enduring image of the stereotype of female criminality that pervaded the Victorian era and indeed cast its shadow over 20th-century popular culture and criminology.</p> <p>The image of the female offender has often approached the ultimate stereo- type of conventional femininity: passive; driven by emotion rather than reason; moved by impulses located in the body rather than the mind. Like most female criminals in novels of the Victorian period, Tess's position as a woman underlines her social powerlessness. </p> <p>But does this image of passive, victimised female criminality, tinged with a shade of madness, stretch as far back into law and literature as it stretches forward? Turn to Tess's literary cousin, Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders (1722), who enlivened our TV screens in 1996. Bold, beautiful and brilliantly resourceful, Moll was ideally qualified to be the heroine of one of the first English novels. She did, however, exhibit one unheroic characteristic. For most of the novel she is involved in distinctly unromantic property offences, including shoplifting, swindling and even stealing from children. Born in Newgate jail of a mother who has escaped execution by \"pleading her belly\", Moll uses her beauty and ingenuity to escape poverty through crime. Adding colour to this pattern of thieving and deception, Moll enjoys an active and varied love life, with plentiful instances of fornication and adultery.</p> <p>Ostensibly, Moll Flanders is a tale of sin and repentance. She is eventually caught, convicted and transported to Virginia with one of her five husbands, a convicted highwayman. Awaiting her punishment in Newgate, she renounces her criminal habits. But, her punishment completed, she is rewarded with riches gained by legitimate use of her talents. It is hard for the modern reader entirely to believe in her reformation. For a morality tale, the moments of her regret and punishment are extraordinarily brief. If Defoe's message was that redemption is always available to the penitent, he also conveys very forcefully that wit, courage and enterprise are valuable attributes for a woman. </p> <p>Moll could not be a greater contrast to the stereotype of female criminality embodied in Tess. For Moll is autonomous, brimming with ambitions and strategies for pursuing them. Unlike Tess, she shapes her own destiny. A strong, active and dominant woman, Moll's world is peopled by women similar to herself. The men in this world are often weak, indecisive and passive.</p> <p>Defoe, we must conclude, found it natural to have a sexually active, socially marginal female thief as his protagonist. And the success of Moll implies early readers received her as being entirely plausible; exceptionally, during that period, women constituted half the defendants before London's main criminal court. Moll's supersession by very different models of female criminality, like Tess, serves as a metaphor for fundamental changes in society. Moll's descendants were caught up in a cluster of social developments that contributed to the unthinkability of such a character in Tess's era. As we watch Tess's fate unfold on TV this autumn, it is perhaps worth asking ourselves whether, in 2008, Moll Flanders is thinkable again - and, if so, whether this is a good thing or a bad.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nicola Lacey is author of Women, Crime and Character: From Moll Flanders to Tess of the d'Urbervilles </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:n.lacey@lse.ac.uk\">n.lacey@lse.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>For a growing number of office workers fluorescent lighting and clunky air-conditioning are fast becoming distant memories, as employers realise that not only is a well-designed working environment essential to attract and retain staff, it also reflects how an organisation is perceived by the outside world.</p> <p>This weekend, thanks to an initiative called <a href=\"http://www.openhouse.org.uk/public/london/event.html\">Open House London</a>, more than 650 London buildings will be open to the public, many of which are office spaces. Some, such as the foyer of 120 Fleet Street, formerly the Daily Express building and considered to be one of the best examples of British art deco, are of historic interest, while others demonstrate that a bold, beautiful building can also be a practical and efficient workplace. </p> <h2>A bit of a shock</h2> <p>The surface of the striking Blue Fin building in Southwark, home to IPC Media, is covered by 2,000 aluminium blue fins that not only change and shimmer throughout the day, but keep the building cool. </p> <p>\"Each office around the perimeter of the building has one of these fins outside the window, so it's a significant part of people's daily experience,\" says Alex Wraight, associate director of architect <a href=\"http://www.alliesandmorrison.com/\">Allies and Morrison</a>. \"They give the building an identity and focus, which is important in a large organisation.\"</p> <p>The fa\u00e7ade is all glass, as are most of the internal walls, which means that although the building is flooded with light, there is very little privacy. \"That was a bit of a shock at first,\" says Claudia Lopes, PA to a director of the weekly titles. \"But everyone is much more accessible now, which is way more important than having privacy. But you do have to keep your desk tidy.\" </p> <p>Open plan spaces are flexible and make it easier to communicate with colleagues, but in the past, unless you happened to be by a window, you might not see a ray of natural light all day. Thankfully architects are finding ingenious ways of getting round this. </p> <h2>Change of scene</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337720368\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/10-queen-street220.jpg\" alt=\"Open House: 10 Queen Street\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Queen Street Place</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Law firm S J Berwin is based in 10 Queen Street Place, SE1. \"The original building was constructed during the financial boom in the 1980s with a vast football pitch space suitable for City traders,\" says Festus Moffatt from <a href=\"http://www.jra.co.uk/\">John Robertson Architects</a>. \"Fifteen years later it was obsolete and we had to find a way of turning it into a modern office that people could work in for another 25 years.\"</p> <p>Interestingly the decision was made not to string a row of offices around the edge of the building, which would inevitably be occupied by lawyers and leave the ancillary staff stuck in the middle with no natural light, but to bring the offices into the middle and create a boulevard around the perimeter of the building so that everyone had access to daylight. </p> <p>\"It's fabulous. Everyone really seems to walk around with a bit more of a spring in their step,\" says PA Gerry Thompson. \"We also have a wonderful roof terrace with unparalleled views of the river where we have social functions, and as Wi-Fi is available throughout the building lawyers can escape with their laptops if they feel they need for a change of scene.\" </p> <h2>Local impact</h2> <p>The Willis building is a spectacular 28-storey building in the heart of the City of London. \"We used to be in a very traditional building and this is a much more conducive working environment,\" says Grant Corrigan, executive director of facilities management for the Willis Group. \"Quite apart from it being lighter and more spacious we have far better communication facilities such as Wi-Fi and an auditorium.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337720369\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/Willis-Building220.jpg\" alt=\"Open House: The Willis Building\" width=\"220\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Willis building.

The Inland Revenue centre in Nottingham was a pioneering \"green\" project in the UK when it was completed in 1984. It is comprised of seven separate buildings, all naturally ventilated. \"Linking into the city district heating system as well as the city streetscape by a network of publicly accessible streets, it immediately became a 'good neighbour' to the community around it,\" says Bill Taylor, a partner at Hopkins Architects who designed the building. </p> <p>Revenue employee Andrea Molver-Hunt says she enjoys working in the building, but it does have some quirks - such as the blinds automatically closing at 6 o'clock at night. </p> <p>Environmental sustainability, along with long-term employee relations, were of crucial importance to Wessex Water when it moved to a new building overlooking the rolling countryside just outside Bath. All the rock that was dug up when it was built was crushed and used for the perimeter walls. The car park was designed around the trees rather than cutting them down, and has porous paving so the water drains into tanks to be recycled. And not surprisingly staff are encouraged not to drink bottled water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337755669\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/18/WessexWater220.jpg\" alt=\"Wessex Water\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Control room, Wessex Water</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bennetts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Our old offices seem really old-fashioned now,\" says Lisa Hobbs, PA to the chairman. \"I used to be tucked away in the chairman's suite, which was very isolating, but now the whole company is open-plan.

  "<p>Venezuela's president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has flouted human rights, persecuted opponents and undermined democracy during his decade in power, according to a damning new report. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog, yesterday accused him of betraying a pledge to shore up the rule of law and turn Venezuela into a progressive beacon.</p> <p>It claimed his government had taken over the courts and cowed the media, trade unions and civil society, leaving the South American oil giant dominated by an over-mighty executive. \"Discrimination on political grounds has been a defining feature of the Ch\u00e1vez presidency, [as] has been an open disregard for the principle of separation of powers,\" it said.</p> <p>The Washington-based Venezuela Information Office, which promotes the Ch\u00e1vez government's view, said Human Rights Watch was biased. \"Their reports on Venezuela have typically been politicised. They don't highlight real advances,\" said Olivia Goumbri, a spokeswoman. Lavish spending of oil revenues on social programmes, for instance, had boosted human rights by reducing poverty and illiteracy, she said.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said Venezuela's worst setback in the past decade was a 2002 coup which briefly replaced Ch\u00e1vez, an anti-democratic putsch backed by George Bush's administration. \"Fortunately it lasted only two days. Unfortunately the Ch\u00e1vez government has exploited it ever since to justify policies that have degraded the country's democracy,\" said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the advocacy group's Americas director.</p> <p>The 230-page report, A Decade Under Ch\u00e1vez, accused the government of sacrificing basic guarantees enshrined in a 1999 constitution - which Ch\u00e1vez had championed - to further its political agenda.</p> <p>It had \"neutralised the judiciary\" by packing the supreme court with allies, and undermined freedom of expression by toughening penalties for criminal defamation and bullying private media into softening criticism. Opponents had been blacklisted from state agencies and the national oil company, notably through a database of those who had signed a petition against the president. Trade unions had been emasculated and human rights activists had been harassed.</p> <p>Steve Ellner, a professor at Venezuela's University of the East, said Human Rights Watch overlooked the opposition's role in polarising Venezuela, not least by refusing to accept Ch\u00e1vez's legitimacy and electoral mandates. </p> <p>\"The report is exaggerated. It fails to place events in their context,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Surfers who ride waves through areas reserved for swimmers off a Cornish beach could be taken to court and issued with antisocial behaviour orders, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Lifeguards at Sennen beach, near Land's End, are so fed up with rogue surfers who refuse to follow the rules that they have turned to the police for help. </p> <p>Police are now considering sending a community support officer to patrol the beach and perhaps even the use of asbos to control the surfers. </p> <p>The beach at Sennen is popular with surfers but has a no-go area which is reserved for people, including many families, who use it for swimming. Lifeguards employed by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution patrol the beach but have no powers to enforce the rules. They have asked the police to help them next summer after a series of incidents in which surfers cut through the bathing zone and almost injured swimmers. </p> <p>Devon and Cornwall police have a project called Beach Beat at St Ives, Newquay and Perranporth in Cornwall, where they have worked with the RNLI to try to cut drinking and antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>There are no current plans to formally extend Beach Beat to Sennen, but an officer could be drafted in to patrol the beach next summer if the problems persist. </p> <p>Local constable Andrew Tonkin said: \"The RNLI lifeguards have logged quite a few problems with surfers recently. There have been particular problems with longboarders whose refusal to use leashes could cause injury to swimmers.\" A leash connects the surfer's ankle to the board and stops it zipping off in a fall. </p> <p>Tonkin said an officer on the beach could monitor surfers' behaviour and, if necessary, intervene. </p> <p>A police spokesman said the Beach Beat project was intended to make the environment safer for all users. He said: \"The idea is to provide a high-visibility uniform presence on the beach.\"</p> <p>The RNLI said it had a problem with a few surfers at Sennen. A spokeswoman said: \"Our lifeguards cannot enforce the bylaws. Their remit is to advise.\" </p> <p>Surfer Sam Bleakly said: \"The idea is narrow-minded. It is unsustainable to pay police to patrol the beach when we already have very qualified RNLI lifeguards. </p> <p>\"Surfers are famous for being rebels. It is part of the identity of the sport and the extra bureaucracy will only create strife.\"</p>",
  "<p>The investors corralled together by Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, to keep Alitalia in Italian hands withdrew their offer for the flag-carrier last night after failing to get unanimous backing from the trade unions.</p> <p>Berlusconi's employment minister, Maurizio Sacconi, said: \"For the workers affected and for the country, the road now opens up that leads to the collapse of all the companies in the Alitalia group.\" </p> <p>He confirmed a warning by the prime minister on Wednesday that none of the workers left jobless would benefit from the generous conditions offered as part of the rescue plan that failed last night.</p> <p>\"The situation is dramatic,\" Berlusconi told reporters in central Rome after receiving the news. \"We could be facing an abyss.\" Asked if that meant Alitalia would be liquidated, he replied: \"Let's see. I want more details.\"</p> <p>The bankruptcy commissioner, Augusto Fantozzi, signalled he had no immediate plans to put the firm into liquidation. Asked in a radio interview if Alitalia would continue flying until the money ran out, he replied: \"That is what the law stipulates and I shall respect the law.\"</p> <p>Minutes before the announcement, Berlusconi had fired up speculation of a possible new offer for the loss-making </p> <p>airline when he told reporters: \"I am not worried. I am hoping for a positive solution.\" </p> <p>Fantozzi said: \"I have spoken personally to the presidents of the big European carriers and they said that, at the moment, they are not interested.\" </p> <p>Alitalia was losing \u20ac2.4m (\u00a31.9m) a day even before the crisis slashed bookings and prompted fuel suppliers to demand cash on the nail. A collapse would strand about 15,000 passengers and mean the loss, directly or indirectly, of 30,000 jobs.</p> <p>Yet when news of the consortium's withdrawal reached pilots and flight attendants assembled in Rome and Milan, there was applause and cheering. Some had earlier chanted: \"Better bust than in the hands of bandits.\"</p> <p>Fantozzi said he had begun to transfer the crews of planes already on the ground to a welfare programme. Italy's civil aviation authority said it had called him to a meeting on Monday to decide if Alitalia's temporary licence should be revoked.</p> <p>The consortium of investors unanimously agreed to withdraw their offer after six of the nine unions represented in Alitalia replied to an ultimatum delivered the previous day with a demand for more talks. In a letter faxed to the investors the hold-out unions said that, contrary to what had been claimed by the government and the consortium, the deal on offer did not guarantee the airline's workers unaltered pay in return for longer hours.</p> <p>They said they wanted a \"revision of the pay structure\" and said an improved deal could be negotiated very quickly.</p> <p>Crucially, Italy's biggest trade union federation, the formerly communist CGIL, which had appeared ready to sign the offer, joined the rejectionists. </p> <p>Sacconi said the investors' decision was \"the logical outcome of the absurd, obstructionist position taken by the CGIL, allied to the autonomous unions representing pilots and flight attendants\".</p> <p>The collapse of Alitalia would be a crushing blow for Berlusconi, who helped scotch an earlier offer from Air France-KLM on grounds of national interest. The rebel unions appeared to be gambling that he would now step in to save face.</p> <p>Fabio Berti, the leader of one of two pilots' associations, said: \"Berlusconi will no doubt step in. He has to do so, because there is a problem of national mobility.\"</p> <p>The consortium was pledged to sink \u20ac1bn into a re-shaped, slimmed-down Alitalia. The plan was to merge the potentially profitable parts of the airline with its main domestic rival, Air One, and dump the company's \u20ac1.2bn debts on the state along with the cost of paying for 3,250 redundant workers. Thousands of others were to have been found jobs in other companies, in many cases on lower pay.</p>",
  "<p>Even if Noel Gallagher hadn't decided to treat the nation to another display of the musical broad-mindedness that's made Oasis's output so giddily eclectic, there might still have been controversy over this year's Glastonbury headliners. Rather than Jay-Z's appearance on the Pyramid Stage, which so alarmed Gallagher, questions might have been asked about the Friday night: precisely when did the Kings of Leon become big enough to headline a festival? </p> <p>On arrival in 2003, had they looked any more like a firework band, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents would have insisted you keep their CDs in a biscuit tin and ensure pets were indoors before playing them. They had all the attributes: a perfectly honed sound that drew on classic rock influences, a carefully cultivated image, and an exotic back-story. Five years on, with most of their peers - the Strokes, the Vines and the Hives - in reduced circumstances, Kings of Leon are playing the O2 Arena, mercifully displacing Katy Perry from the top of the singles chart and earning plaudits from unlikely sources: Ed O'Brien of Radiohead has proclaimed them \"the greatest band in the world\". How did this happen? </p> <p>The single that dethroned Katy Perry offers few clues. Sex on Fire's awful title sounds like the name of a sub-Hot Gossip dance troupe, and indeed the song sounds like something they might have done robotics to: an arid AOR march, of the kind that sprang up in the wake of the Police's success. It's very much in the tradition of Soft, from their second album, Aha Shake Heartbreak, on which vocalist Caleb Followill offered to \"pop myself in your body\" - leaving you wondering how four young men who, according to music press reports, have an enormous amount of sex can be so hopeless at writing about it. </p> <p>Nevertheless, much of Only By the Night is unmistakably the work of a band making music with arenas in mind. Sometimes it's intriguing: I Want You takes the Pixies route, a brooding song with a deadpan bassline, while Crawl is trumpeted as their contribution to the ongoing political debate in the United States. Crawl's vague references to \"a crucified USA\" and unnamed persons who \"never went to Sunday mass\" but \"want to see us crawl\" leave you unclear as to whether the band are liberals waving the flag for Barack Obama or religious-minded Southerners convinced that he's out to turn America into the new Soviet Union. </p> <p>You're struck by the sense that the Kings of Leon might currently feel the urge to write songs that Say Something whether or not they have Something to Say. But you can't argue with the music: muscular, distorted bass, a Jane's Addiction-style riff and a fantastic guitar solo. The disembodied bleeps and arcs of feedback on Closer, a song that appears to be about vampires of the non-metaphorical variety, are suitably chilling, which is more than can be said for the words: \"Stranded in this spooky town ... \" Zoinks, Scooby! </p> <p>Occasionally, their desire for widescreen grandiosity leads to some curious decisions, not least on 17, which heralds its arrival with a combination of ringing chimes and descending glam rock chord sequence that, to British ears at least, signifies only one thing: we're rolling back the prices this Christmas at Asda. Most often, however, they go for a kind of sleek AOR, your tolerance for which may depend on how fondly you recall the soundtrack to The Breakfast Club. Certainly, Use Somebody sounds like something you'd hear in the background while Molly Ringwald comes to a realisation about herself: the guitars chime U2-ishly, everything booms with reverb, the chorus goes \"woah-oh\". There's no doubting its efficacy as a stadium-rock anthem, although a cynic might suggest there's something rather gimlet-eyed about its ambition, particularly given that the lyrics concern that perennially engaging topic: how terrible it is being in a successful rock band. </p> <p>But stadium rock audiences are happy to overlook gimlet-eyed ambition and a certain lyrical hollowness: no one ever demanded a refund at a Coldplay gig because the songs were too calculating and the words to Fix You rang a little trite. They want big, streamlined tunes, which is what Only By the Night provides. Occasionally, it provides them in a way that suggests the Kings of Leon could be a more intriguing and characterful band if they wanted, but perhaps they don't want. They're putting plenty of bums on seats as they are.</p>",

  "<p>I have just done the shopping at one of our local supermarkets in the Tarn region of France. At the entrance to the Leclerc car park in Gaillac there is a McDonald's. Today it looked full. It looked full the last time I drove past too, with cars queueing at the outside takeaway hatch. McDonald's. In France. Full. Listen to many politicians and anti-globalisation campaigners in France, and the fast-food choices that so many French families make are collective acts of culinary treason. At the very least, in a country where restaurants serve snails, fast food is clearly culturally aberrant. Much more than that, however, McDonald's represents to these critics all that is worst in globalisation: indeed, it represents all that is worst, full stop. It stands for big, brutal, unethical business, for US imperialism, for environmental despoliation, for loss of jobs and local identity, for the rape of familiar terroir, for the further impoverishment of the downtrodden, and so on ... and on and on. The world is a bad place run by neoliberal ideologues. The state has been overthrown by roistering banks and grasping multinationals. </p> <p>All of which would be more convincing if the French themselves weren't such effective globalists. French businesses are globally very successful. Carrefour comes second only to Wal-Mart in size as a mass-market retailer. Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy owns New Zealand's Cloudy Bay wine. How's that for respect of <em>terroir</em>?</p> <p>As a colonial power, France inculcated its territories with Frenchness - the food, the language, the education, the urban planning. In parts of Hanoi even today, there is a thoroughly French feel with its squares and boulevards. The croissant is as widely travelled as the burger. So it is not commercial or cultural imperialism that the French political class abhors, but the stamp not bearing the words \"Made in France\". </p> <p>But perhaps it's unfair to single out the French for their ability to demonise certain manifestations of the free flow in people, business and culture while happily accepting others. The anti-globalisation movement, in its many forms, is a tangle of incompatible attitudes. The romantic right argues that globalisation destroys community, erodes custom, and brings lots of strange people into our country - wherever it may be - who eat the wrong food, worship the wrong gods, speak the wrong language and cannot be trusted to root for the national team. The romantic left argues that globalisation makes the strong stronger and the weak weaker, undermining individual freedoms by chipping away at the welfare state in the developed world, leaving individuals everywhere exposed to the remorseless exploitative force of capital. What both groups share is their opposition to liberal principles that open up countries to do more business with one another, while governments allow markets to operate with the minimum of interference under the rule of law. </p> <p>With international banks failing and stock markets crashing, this is not the easiest of times to make the case for globalisation. Yet this is a cause that is worth fighting for. Those who defend globalisation stake out the territory of liberalism, the liberalism of free choice and expression, the liberalism that believes that individuals will usually make sensible choices within an open market that benefit both themselves and their societies. Globalisation is ultimately about choices exercised on a global level: economic choices, lifestyle choices and identity choices. </p> <p>What defines the anti-globalisation radicals, by contrast, is an extraordinary lack of faith in human beings. The movement of people from one country to another will apparently destroy national cohesion and integrity. Individuals will be ground down, along with their local identity, by an impersonal global capitalist machine. Consumer choice will be distorted by and subjugated to the marketing of brands. The \"comparative advantage\" of poverty will lead to the export of jobs from rich countries, impoverishing white-collar as well as blue-collar workers. </p> <p>Globalisation is something \"out there\", a pitiless, inexorable process, or else a shadowy, threatening conspiracy. The irony of anti-globalisation, even at the extremes of ecological Druidism, Islamic radicalism, skinhead isolationism or Marxist irredentism, is that all the activists are more than happy to use the means of globalisation - cheap air fares, internet communication, blogging, money transfers - even as they damn them. I once saw someone at a demonstration in London holding a poster announcing the presence of \"The World-Wide Movement against Globalisation\". </p> <p>This may be one of the ironies of globalisation, that the foundation of a truly global civil society will begin in the organisations and charities of the anti-globalisation movement. They can certainly use the technologies and methods of globalisation to try to change the choices people make. For all the talk about powerlessness, those who reject globalisation have the power to shut it down if they build up a sufficiently large critical mass, if they are able to put themselves in control of the right levers of power. It is salutary to remember that those who came so close in Europe to shattering belief in democracy and the values of reason and liberalism in the 1930s and 40s began life as bands of extremists. Lenin, Stalin and Hitler all rose out of the wreckage of liberalism. </p> <p>Extremism is not the only \"ism\" that we need to worry about among the anti-globalists. There is also much ill-informed anti-Americanism. As Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye point out in Governance in a Globalising World, \"Globalism is not intrinsically American, even if its current phase is heavily influenced by what happens in the United States.\"</p> <p>We should beware, in other words, of overstating the case that global civilisation is American civilisation. David Beckham may be a global sporting superstar, known from Birmingham to Beijing to Borneo, but in Baltimore he is \"David who?\" The Italian culinary magazine Gambero Rosso asserts that while there may be 17,000 McDonald's outside the US, there are 54,000 decent Italian restaurants outside Italy. Even those loathed symbols of American cultural expansion, the hamburger and the frankfurter, testify to earlier German influence. </p> <p>What the US does contribute is as much a distinctive and successfully competitive way of doing things as a distinctive civilisation: how to combine, for instance, several cuisines on a miniature assembly line (miniature, so that it can be called handmade), operating from a corner franchise, financed by a multinational corporation that also handles strategy and advertising, while outsourcing cleaning to the lowest bidder and data entry to a firm in Mumbai. Such is the genius of the US. The export of the McDonald's model is a much greater component of globalisation than the export of actual McDonald's, while the uptake of both the model and the McDonald's is about choice within the free market. There is nothing imposed or imperial about this aspect of American culture, any more than there is in the spread of Italian restaurants. Neither the burger nor pasta manifests a colonial hegemony. </p> <p>The greatest threat to globalisation comes from the rich and powerful states failing to make the corrections in the system that would benefit all. Better government and different policies, for example, would have prevented the mortgage crisis and the resulting credit crunch. What created mayhem in the financial markets was not the inherent weakness of globalisation but the greedy incompetence of the banks and other credit institutions, whose precise level of exposure to bad debts seemed sometimes to be obfuscated by the technology they employed. I remember a banker once trying to explain to me how the mortgage of, say, an unemployed single parent in St Louis could be morphed into a triple-A rated financial investment in London, New York or Paris. Magically, impoverishment became a \"special investment vehicle\". Try as hard as the banker did to get me to comprehend the beautiful simplicities of the whole process, I remained baffled. It was, I suppose, some sort of relief later on to discover that it was not me who was stupid. </p> <p>Governments, central banks and other regulators do not want to react too heavy-handedly to the crash. They can hope not only that in the short term American and European banks will be bailed out by Middle East and Asian investors, but that growth in Asia will help avoid a global economic crash. Some changes, however, will have to be made. Regulators need to take a beady look at the way banks pay their staff: the bonus culture needs to change. It is not self-evidently in the interests of the shareholders who own a bank that its executives are paid more for taking ever greater risks. Bank lending should also be constrained during periods when asset prices are booming - when the froth is piling up.</p> <p>We must not, however, allow the current turmoil in the financial markets to blind us to what globalisation has achieved, above all for developing countries. The growth in world trade in the last century was substantial. It doubled as a proportion of world output in that period. More trade means more economic activity, more jobs, more investment and more prosperity. By the last decade, a quarter to a third of the growth in trade was between the 60,000 multinational corporations and their 820,000 foreign subsidiaries. In less than four decades, the exports of manufactured goods from developing to developed countries rose 12-fold.</p> <p>Most of the international investment by rich countries - the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - goes to about 30 newly industrialising economies. As a result Sao Paolo, for example, has been described as one of Germany's largest industrial cities, home to more German industrial firms than any other foreign city in the world. </p> <p>Increases in trade and investment have triggered growth that has lifted unprecedented numbers of people out of poverty, especially in Asia. The number of people in east Asia in extreme poverty (that is, living on less than a dollar a day) fell during the 1990s from 486 million to 275 million; in China itself the decline was from 376 million to 222 million.</p> <p>Globalisation, then, has not been an impoverishing conspiracy by the rich against the poor. If it has not helped every country, that is because some countries have excluded themselves by accident or design from the whole liberal project, some have been excluded by its imperfections, and others still have governments too weak or incompetent to take advantage of it. </p> <p>India, for example, would be much more prosperous if reform had been pushed further and faster. As it is, that country's fractured political system has made it particularly easy for interest groups to block radical changes in public spending. It is generally reckoned that 10% of India's GDP - roughly 40% of all public spending - goes into subsidies to cut the food, water and power bills of the relatively prosperous. </p> <p>Within the US and Europe, hostility to free trade is on the rise, largely because it is seen as a threat to jobs and livelihoods. Switch on Lou Dobbs' news programme on CNN and you hear about the hollowing-out of the American middle class. Not only have blue-collar workers lost their jobs to foreign competition, but now white-collar jobs are threatened mainly by outsourcing. Moreover, while all this is happening, immigrants are allegedly streaming into the US, partly at the behest of big business, to keep the labour market weak. Figures for the first quarter of 2004, however, suggested that less than 2% of layoffs in the US were the result of relocation overseas. A survey for McKinsey showed that every dollar spent on outsourcing in India led to a larger benefit back home. Others suggest that jobs are not on the whole lost to India or China - they disappear because technologies change. Protectionism is invariably about protecting the losers from this process, pinning labour down in low value-added, low-paid jobs at a high cost to consumers and taxpayers.</p> <p>This is not how it seems, of course, nor how it is portrayed. The result is that globalisation is viewed a lot more favourably in poor countries than in rich ones. A survey for the Financial Times in July 2007, measuring views on globalisation in the US and Europe, showed that in none of these countries was it believed that globalisation had a more positive than negative effect. In Spain, Britain and the US less than a fifth of respondents thought that globalisation had been beneficial to them; they were plainly affected by resentment at growing income disparities and low regard for company bosses. That, someone should have pointed out, is the result not of rampant globalisation but of poor domestic government. A chief executive in Japan typically earns 11 times as much as one of his average workers; his typical American counterpart earns 170 times as much. You do not have to be a socialist to regard this as pretty grotesque.</p> <p>The growing protectionist sentiment in the US and Europe is particularly noisome because it reeks of so much hypocrisy. We preach free trade to the poor while shutting their own goods out of our markets, or slapping prohibitive tariffs on them. The most notorious examples of this are in agriculture. I was privy to the row at a European Council meeting in 2002 when Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac went head-to-head over the impact of agricultural protectionism on poor African countries. In response to a rather mild critique by Blair of the disjuncture between French expressions of concern about the poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and French support for agricultural protectionism, Chirac blew a Gallic gasket. Presidential rage was excited by the observation, as it were, that the vicar was committing adultery behind the presbytery. But the story about agricultural protection in the US, Europe and Japan is true. At the beginning of the new century the EU provided in subsidies more than 100 times as much money for each Union cow as for each sub-Saharan African human being - $913 in contrast to $8. Japanese cows enjoyed an even bigger, almost 2,000-fold advantage. Subsidies in rich countries, which invariably go to the better-off farmers, disrupt global markets and cut back the exporting prospects of poor farmers in poor countries. As Martin Wolf noted in his book Why Globalisation Works, the world's least-developed countries face tariffs that are four to five times higher than those faced by the richest economies.</p> <p>European politicians talk more and more about protecting their industries against Asian competition, and occasionally do so. The debate in the US, however, is much louder and more aggressive. Americans have already used spurious security arguments to block the sale of six port-management businesses in the country to a Dubai-based company. Opponents of the deal in 2006 included senators John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. There is growing protectionist sentiment even in those parts of the Democratic party that piloted the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) through Congress. There is a general feeling, especially in Asia, that a change of administration in Washington should bring a more sensitive multilateral approach to security issues, but might lead also to a ham-fisted and unilateralist policy on international economic affairs. American politicians might recall the impact of the protectionist Smoot-Hawley legislation in 1930, which helped to tip the US and the world over the edge into depression and a slump in world trade. </p> <p>The increase in the number of multinational corporations, which account for more than 20% of world production and 70% of world trade, has not, surprisingly, attracted the wrath of the anti-globalisation movement. This has been aggravated by the growth of investment instruments such as hedge funds and private equity companies. Private equity companies now employ through their investments in Europe about the same number of people as the population of the Netherlands. There are serious issues about the role of these new financial instruments, touching on transparency, the taxation of profits, the driving down in the past of the price of risk and the driving up of the amount of credit in the marketplace. But these questions, which ignore the fact that the main investors in these vehicles tend to be the organisations that manage pensions for you and me, do not really add to or subtract from the rage about big capitalism. </p> <p>Part of the argument against capitalism is unanswerable. Money often confers power - market power, political power. Is life fair? No. Have collective attempts to make it more fair been successful? No - unless equality of misery and oppression is regarded as desirable. Can the rich enjoy themselves more than the rest of us? Well, they can spend more money, that's for sure, but quite why they choose to do this in places such as Monte Carlo has always puzzled me. Can a lower tax bill ever make it worth living somewhere so expensively tacky? Yet it is not simply envy and resentment about money that drags the corporate world into the centre of the debate about globalisation. After all, there would be rich people even if we lived in a world where there was widescale protectionism, and as we saw in China and the Soviet Union, socialism often generates both poverty and extreme inequality. </p> <p>The two other charges that need to be answered are, first, that globalisation leads to a race to the bottom in the conditions of workers and environmental quality and regulation and, second, that the economics of globalisation threaten the end of the nation-state. Concern about the race to the bottom was not the reason for labour unions joining the demonstrations in Seattle. They were not concerned principally about the conditions experienced by workers in poor countries. They wanted to protect their own jobs in a rich country. Wages are lower and working conditions usually worse in poor countries. Growth raises pay levels and improves conditions. There is scant evidence that wages are driven down by multinationals, nor that they help perpetuate indefinitely bad working conditions. As growth accelerates, child labour falls. Any multinational, if it is sensible, will try to ensure that its factories everywhere meet high standards, something that makes good business sense, not least since the consumers and the workforce in their countries of origin increasingly demand it. While there are many things wrong with China, it is not obvious that the lack of a strong trade union movement is the biggest of them. Strong trade unions would represent a welcome development of civil society in that country, but they might also have held back economic development, as has happened in India. Trade unions there have been all too effective in imposing conditions on governments and employers that inhibit growth and give too many people the privilege of continuing joblessness and poverty. </p> <p>There are terrible examples of corporate capitalist recklessness in developing countries; the chemical leak in the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, is an often-cited instance. But capitalists are not always wrong, as was shown in 1995 when Shell and the British government, under pressure from Greenpeace activists, gave up a perfectly sensible plan to dump the Brent Spar oil platform at sea in favour of a more expensive and less environmentally friendly disposal on shore. Nor does the record of central planning suggest that it offers benefits to living conditions or the environment. A visit to central Asia - to the shrinking and polluted Aral Sea, for example - provides evidence of that. It is true that growth affects the environment; that is not a problem to lay at the door of globalisation, unless we embrace the full eco-totalitarian position that everyone - everyone else, that is - has an inalienable right to live in a primitive state of nature. A World Bank study in 2003 showed that with very few exceptions companies did not choose to invest in poorer countries in order to avoid the costs of pollution abatement in richer ones. </p> <p>So what about the charge that globalisation kills off the state? Does economic globalisation mean the end of sovereignty and the creation of new kinds of governance, perhaps by global corporations, with what the essayist John Ralston Saul describes as their own royal court, their own fool, at Davos, the annual World Economic Forum? When discussing globalisation, the greatest danger time and again is in letting the word itself run far ahead of the thing it is supposed to describe. We know that a central feature is greater trade between more open economies brought closer together by technology. But global corporations such as Exxon Mobil, General Motors and Wal-Mart are still operating within structures that influence and constrain what they do. They have to be aware, for a start, of a network of other firms and businesses, producers and customers. </p> <p>The principal regulator of any production line or enterprise remains the nation-state, though there are other supranational institutions, such as the IMF , the WTO, or regional groupings such as the EU or Nafta, that also contribute to regulating companies. States have set up an expanding number of suprastate organisations with their own growing jurisdiction. Shipping laws are written by the International Maritime Organisation; air-safety laws by the International Civil Aviation Organisation; many food standards are set by the Food and Agriculture Organisation. There are expanding networks of influence and control from banking and accountancy to health and water. Many corporations inevitably try to shop around for lighter regulation; many states seek to provide it. The fact remains that all big corporations continue to operate within national and international regulatory frameworks, even if some are ingenious in manipulating them to reduce their tax burden. From an economic standpoint, globalisation is defined not by the obsolescence of the state, nor by the rise of new \"megacorporations\" with greater value than the GDPs of many states. What really defines what has been happening are the new interactions between corporations and national and international regulatory regimes. </p> <p>It is an awful thing when states die, as the world saw in China in the 1920s and 30s and the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. But whatever the scaremongers might tell you, it is not what we are witnessing today.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Extracted from What Next?: Surviving the Twenty-first Century by Chris Patten, to be published by Allen Lane on October 2, price \u00a325.

  "<p>The Bush administration last night accused the Kremlin of aggression and authoritarianism and said Moscow's main aim in invading Georgia last month was to overthrow the country's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. In the strongest attack since Russian forces routed Georgia's military in a five-day war last month, the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said President Dmitri Medvedev and his prime minister, Vladimir Putin, had launched Russia on a path to pariah status.</p> <p>The US broadside came as attempts to deploy scores of military monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Georgia's conflict zones collapsed yesterday when Russia refused to allow them to patrol in South Ossetia, the breakaway region of northern Georgia bordering Russia that Moscow has recognised as an independent state.</p> <p>Weeks of negotiations at the OSCE's headquarters in Vienna ended in failure when the Russians stiffened the terms for the proposed deployments to rule out any international presence in South Ossetia, western diplomats said. The OSCE already had an agreement to send 100 military observers to Georgia, but negotiations over their mandate were gridlocked when the US and European allies rejected Russia's new terms. \"There was no basis for consensus,\" said the OSCE's Finnish presidency. \"There is no point in continuing negotiations.\"</p> <p>The OSCE has eight military monitors in Georgia who are mandated to operate in South Ossetia, but the Russians have not allowed them to enter the contested region since the war ended last month. </p> <p>The invasion of Georgia was but one element in growing Russian aggression beyond its borders, Rice said in Washington, citing Moscow's exploitation of its energy resources as a political weapon, its threats to target Poland and the Czech republic with nuclear weapons, and its backing away from international arms control treaties.</p> <p>\"Our strategic goal now is to make it clear to Russia's leaders that their choices are putting Russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance,\" she said. \"The picture emerging from this pattern of behaviour is that of a Russia increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad.\" Moscow's \"primary war aim\" in Georgia was to overthrow Saakashvili's government, an aim that would not succeed, she pledged.</p> <p>The failure in Vienna yesterday means that the EU will play the main international role in Georgia.</p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has agreed with the Kremlin on the dispatch of at least 200 EU monitors to Georgia. They are to be operational by the end of the month, but will be concentrated in the Russia-proclaimed \"buffer zone\" outside the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - which Moscow has also recognised as independent - and will not be allowed into the two regions that the Russians are garrisoning with almost 8,000 troops.</p> <p>The Sarkozy peace plan has attracted muted criticism from Washington and Nato officials for being too lenient on the Russians. EU officials dismissed the jibes. \"Without the EU, you don't get the Russians out [of Georgia]. There is no alternative. The Americans cannot be part of the solution here,\" said an EU official.</p> <p>The EU mission in Georgia is to be headed by French and German diplomats. France, Germany and Italy, which all tend towards a pro-Russia stance in the conflict, are contributing 140 of the 200 personnel. Britain is contributing 20 observers.</p>",
  "<p>Barring an improbable Kent collapse on a pitch now playing far fewer tricks, Lancashire will lose this game, and therefore slip into the relegation zone ahead of a trip to title-challenging Somerset in next week's last round of fixtures. But thanks largely to their increasingly beleaguered captain, Stuart Law, they will at least have gone down with a fight.</p> <p>Law, whose future with the county remains in doubt after his fierce criticism of the committee's decision to release Dominic Cork, emerged from an unusually lean month - 42 runs from six innings in all cricket - by grafting to 79 from 127 balls, his highest championship score in 11 innings since his only century of the season, at Hove in July.</p> <p>With Karl Brown, a youngster from Atherton who failed to score in his only previous championship innings, showing promise in a supporting role, Law first averted the danger of an embarrassing innings defeat. He might even have been starting to think of setting Kent a challenging fourth-innings target when he lost concentration and upper-cut Ryan McLaren to third man, where Amjad Khan took a good low catch.</p> <p>As it is, despite a few lusty blows by Glen Chapple, the lead is only 131, so Kent remain firmly on course for a 19-point victory that would leave them six clear of the current First Division leaders Hampshire, but, most probably, 12 behind Nottinghamshire. A first championship title since 1978, to make amends for this summer's succession of one-day near-misses, would remain a tantalising possibility.</p> <p>Justin Kemp claimed most of the credit for extending their overnight first-innings lead of 40 to 126. The tall South African played with impressive restraint and was unbeaten on 56 when Steven Croft won the seventh lbw decision of the innings.</p> <p>Amjad was again the pick of Kent's bowlers on a ground where he took eight wickets as a 21-year-old, having Brown and Paul Horton caught behind playing loose shots, and removing Luke Sutton's middle stump with an inswinger.</p>",
  "<p>'We've always felt like we are quite alone - we're Mercury Rev, we don't sound like anyone else,\" says Jonathan Donahue, the band's singer and guitarist. \"And while at times that's a very respectable medal to wear, at other times it can be very difficult to accept. It's like seeing everyone else ushered into this other room that says 'rock'n'roll' and you're left standing outside with everyone else, saying, 'Oh it's so cool to be you.'\"</p> <p>The group's new album, Snowflake Midnight, will, if anything, make that distinction even greater. It's unlike anything they have done before, and sees their idiosyncratic guitar music - which achieved its widest exposure with their 1998 album, Deserter's Songs - radically reinvented. And it could hardly be described as rock'n'roll. Mercury Rev have used programmed beats and electronics before, but Snowflake Midnight is an unexpected and potent melding of rock, ambient and post-techno styles. Despite this change of tack, with Donahue's plaintive man-child voice and the songs' melodic shapes, it's still recognisably a Mercury Rev album.</p> <p>Snowflake Midnight took its shape from hours of playing and trying out ideas. \"We just played, expressing ourselves for the joy of it,\" says Donahue. \"If it had a parallel, in that respect, it would be at the beginning of Yerself Is Steam.\" </p> <p>However, Yerself Is Steam, their 1991 debut album, was a far more feral affair. Of all the American groups who were attracting UK press attention at the time - Dinosaur Jr, Mudhoney, Nirvana, Superchunk - Mercury Rev were the most original. Theirs was a sort of toxic psychedelia consisting of pop tunes decorated by pretty flute lines, which were then buffeted by monstrous guitars. They were also the most unstable of bands, with a reputation for fractiousness and live shows that skirted the edge of chaos. It was usually only a matter of time before the chaos took over completely: sometimes David Baker, the original vocalist, would disappear into the audience or even the bar. </p> <p>\"I think we were doing our best individually to keep it together, but it was bigger than all of us in some intangible way,\" offers Donahue. \"But that element of chaos was something that was very prominent in America from the 80s. If you'd ever seen the Replacements play, you weren't even sure they were going to make it through to the third song. Or Sonic Youth, who would go off on tangents. That's how we were cast in a way. We were experimental and there was always an element of risk.\"</p> <p>When I first interviewed Mercury Rev in 1992, they wound me up relentlessly. Baker told me he thought I was sexy - \"but not much\" - before insisting I play drums with them for the encore at their show that night at the Clapham Grand. The interview culminated in an argument between him and the rest of the group on behalf of their absent drummer. I was relieved to get away from them, as well as to escape any onstage duties.</p> <p>Today, Donahue and the other extant founder member, laconic guitarist, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Sean \"Grasshopper\" Mackowiak, laugh at the memory of that encounter. Having come out the other side of band fights, drug addiction and breakdowns, they look back on their past with amusement and some discomfort: really, it's a wonder they ever got here from there. </p> <p>Mercury Rev formed in 1984 when Donahue, Grasshopper and Baker met at high school in Buffalo, New York, and made some primitive home recordings backing Baker's improvised vocal raps. A more disciplined but still loosely agglomerated six-piece group recorded Yerself Is Steam, initially as an experiment in sound, to give to their friends on cassette. But word of Mercury Rev's extraordinary music spread quickly. They played their first gig in a small bar in Fredonia, New York, to about 70 people in 1991. But their second, in one of the most spectacularly anomalous misbillings of all time, found the inexperienced group supporting Bob Dylan. They came off stage unable to make out what proportion of their noisy reception was jeering and what cheering. Grasshopper remembers being scrutinised by a mysterious figure during their set. \"I looked over and saw someone at the side of the stage watching, and he had a sweatshirt with the hood up. I realised it was Dylan and I just got really scared.</p> <p>\"Then it was the Reading festival, with 20,000 people,\" Donahue continues. \"We didn't realise it was going so fast. We hadn't planned on being a band. No one had planned on taking time off from work; we'd never been away from home; we'd never been around each other for more than three days in a row. When there was unity, we were an unstoppable force. When there wasn't, it was more like the big bang - the arguments were instantaneous, almost without a cause.\" </p> <p>Fanciful tales of lunacy began to circulate, and it was even rumoured that the group had taken an analyst on tour with them. \"The analyst was heavily suggested by our lawyer at the time,\" nods Donahue. \"He said, 'Yeah, I can do these record deals for you, but I don't see you guys lasting more than a year.'\"</p> <p>The group's second album, Boces, came out in 1993. Remarkably inventive, and featuring a children's chorus, a scratch jazz ensemble and field recordings, its fractured, convulsive content mirrored the uneasy complexity of the relationships within the group. Ultimately, Baker was asked to leave. \"It was just getting too crazy,\" says Grasshopper. Donahue adds: \"He would have killed us, or we him.\" Mercury Rev's music subsequently took on a sunnier, more melodic disposition on 1995's See You On the Other Side. </p> <p>Donahue's assertion that the group felt \"quite alone\" was true even on their most commercially successful album, Deserter's Songs. By this time, Donahue and Grasshopper - ostensibly the only full-time group members - had decamped to the Catskill mountains. Their new songs had a more relaxed, rootsier feel - Garth Hudson and Levon Helm from the Band, who were staying nearby, guested - with sweeping strings, bowed saw and the odd dance groove, while those big guitars occasionally loomed into the picture. It was also the first album featuring contributions from drummer and keyboard player Jeff Mercel, now a full-time member.</p> <p>Although the music may have sounded more relaxed, if somewhat melancholy, in fact Donahue was battling heroin addiction, something he declines to talk about now. Grasshopper, meanwhile, retreated to a Jesuit monastery in Spain during a lull in the album's recording to sort himself out.</p> <p>\"I was pretty scrambled up inside and it just helped me to reflect and to bring some brakes on certain things in my life that were spinning out of control,\" he says. \"For anybody who wants to go there, it's highly recommended. Just step out of reality for a second, empty yourself out, all the baggage.\"</p> <p>By the time of 2005's The Secret Migration, it felt as though Mercury Rev might be getting a little foursquare, a little grandiose in a sub-Pink Floyd kind of way. But their reinvention through Snowflake Midnight has changed all that. \"It is still us and there are things that run like a time-space continuum through all the albums, like the layering of sounds,\" says Donahue. \"But we didn't premeditate it, like: now it's time to go into electronics. It wouldn't be sincere. You'd get the impression that there's a band changing for the sake of change.\" </p> <p>Snowflake Midnight is more a bold step forward than a band flailing around for a new direction. And after consistently turning themselves inside out on record, as they put it, maybe they have at last found some kind of peace. The main lyrical themes are transcendence and transience, exemplified by Snowflake in a Hot World. The songs carry a wide-eyed innocence and wonder at the world that is peculiarly affecting. And, as ever, it doesn't sound like anyone else. Saxophone, clarinet and oboe are used alongside percussion, guitars and drums, and a collection of custom-built synths that have been lying around unused for more than a decade. Just occasionally the rock-like momentum of their matrix of beats invites comparisons with the Chemical Brothers - for whom Donahue played guitar on Dig Your Own Hole - but Mercury Rev's music is more song-based, episodic and texturally diverse. </p> <p>In fact, Donahue and Grasshopper were not approaching their album with dance music in mind - they had been listening to 20th-century minimalist and avant garde composers. They cite Philip Glass's trademark rippling arpeggios, the still-life drones of La Monte Young and Tony Conrad, and the hall-of-mirrors patterns of Terry Riley's echo-delay saxophone pieces as principal influences.</p> <p>\"For some reason, the transformation was in us and coming out of us. What we were conscious of was not to stand in its way. Your first inclination is to say, 'Let's erase it - don't let anybody know we did this.' Or, 'This sounds really weird - let's try to corral this wild horse, fellas.' The real consciousness came with thinking, let's see where this leads. We've got nothing to lose. For us, that process is quite natural. It is nature. Things are in flux.\"</p> <p>This has been one of the most productive phases of Mercury Rev's career, with around 70 pieces of music in various stages of completion and an instrumental sister album, Strange Attractor, available for free download. </p> <p>Speaking to Donahue, it's obvious he is delighted where Mercury Rev are at this point in their long and difficult journey. \"Yeah, you are walking away from that conflict in the mind that's comparing what you are doing to what you've done,\" he confirms. \"And when you walk away from that, you totally negate it. And that's liberation.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Strange Attractor is available for download on on September 29 from <a href=\"http://www.mercuryrev.com\">mercuryrev.com</a></p>",
  "<p>FBI officials and secret service investigators were trying yesterday to track down hackers who broke into an email account belonging to US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Information from the account, including her emails, digital photos and online address book, was posted on the internet on Tuesday, after an unidentified individual guessed the password to the Alaska governor's personal email account.</p> <p>Screenshots and information were made available on the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, which defended its decision saying the hack proved Palin was violating rules on keeping public records by sending official emails through her private Yahoo account.</p> <p>\"Governor Palin has come under criticism for using private email accounts to conduct government business and in the process avoid transparency laws,\" the website said. \"The list of correspondence, together with the account name, appears to reinforce the criticism.\"</p> <p>Although some of the emails, from an account held at gov.palin@yahoo.com, appeared to be private, other screenshots showed messages to state government aides, as well as a draft letter to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p> <p>The hack was initially attributed to an activist group known as Anonymous, a group of internet vigilantes and anarchists which has previously locked horns with scientologists and internet paedophiles. However, yesterday an individual claiming to speak for the group said that Anonymous would never break the law by hacking into somebody else's email account.</p> <p>Federal investigators are examining details of the hack to determine the identities of those responsible. The Wikileaks website became unavailable soon after the incident, though it remains unclear why.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Republican presidential campaign said the attack was invasive and unwarranted. \"We hope that anyone in possession of the emails will destroy them,\" he added.</p> <p>The use of non-government email services to conduct official business has been criticised in the past. Official government communications are required to be preserved under federal law. Without using official communications channels, it remains unclear whether emails from private accounts are being correctly kept.</p> <p>Last year the issue came to the fore after it emerged that the Bush administration had been using private accounts to conduct White House business.</p> <p>A number of senior Bush advisers, including former political strategist Karl Rove, were discovered to have been using private accounts. Documents lost as a result included email conversations about the controversial dismissal of a number of United States attorneys.</p> <p>The attack on Palin's account is likely to have stemmed from recent speculation about her decision to fire the Alaska public safety commissioner in July. An independent investigation is under way to examine allegations that the governor sacked Walter Monegan because of his refusal to dismiss a state trooper, Mike Wooten - who happened to be locked in a custody battle with Palin's sister. </p> <p>The trooper row is due to come to a head today when Alaskan legislators are scheduled to open a hearing. Subpoenas have been issued to 13 witnesses, including Sarah Palin's husband, Todd. </p> <p>The owner of the software used by the hacker or hackers to protect their identity said that he believed it would be possible to identify the culprit. Gabriel Ramuglia told news website The Register: \"Since they were dumb enough to post a full screenshot that showed most of the URL I should be able to find that in my log.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ben Stiller lopes into the hotel suite, his shoulders around his ears, his gaze set to freeze. He's on his guard and I'm on mine. In the days before our interview I run into three separate people who have met him before. Away from the cameras, I am warned, Hollywood's court jester is no jester at all. He is, they tell me, a clenched, complicated individual; an unwitting comedy superstar and possibly an unwilling one, too. Stiller allows this, up to a point. \"I totally get why people see me as the comedy guy,\" he sighs. \"That doesn't mean I don't have different ideas of where I want to go.\"</p> <p>At the age of 42, he has found a lucrative run of form as the ultimate anti-star of American cinema; Hollywood's outsider on the inside; the frustrated everyman (in Meet the Parents, Flirting With Disaster) or the ludicrous buffoon (Zoolander, Dodgeball). And he is not knocking this success, exactly. It just isn't quite how it was meant to be.</p> <p>So what is he to do? Tropic Thunder, his latest film as a director, hardly signals a U-turn. It is a big, loud, fitfully hilarious blockbuster about a bunch of preening megastars who get lost in the jungle while shooting a Vietnam war epic. Stiller headlines as a fading action hero named Tugg Speedman, while Robert Downey Jr co-stars, in blackface, as an Australian method actor, who may (or may not) be based on Russell Crowe. \"I don't read the script,\" Downey Jr mutters at one stage. \"The script reads me.\" </p> <p>Stiller explains that he actually had the idea for the film 20 years ago. In the late 1980s, he had a small part (billed 12th) in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun and auditioned (unsuccessfully) for a role in Oliver Stone's Platoon. This was the era of Hamburger Hill and Full Metal Jacket, when Hollywood pups were getting packed off to actor's boot camp and then insisting that it was, y'know, just like the real thing, man. \"There's something funny about actors who take themselves too seriously,\" Stiller says. \"It's a strange job, acting in a war movie. It's about pretending to be a tough guy from a very pampered position.\" At the time he envisaged Tropic Thunder as a short three-minute skit. He's come a long way since then. </p> <p>Oddly enough, the spectacle of a white actor in blackface caused barely a ripple when Tropic Thunder was released in the US. Instead, the controversy was sparked elsewhere. Stiller's movie contains a film-within-a-film called Simple Jack, in which Tugg Speedman makes a blatant bid for an Oscar by going \"full retard\". Simple Jack is a stammering village idiot who coos winsomely over his mother's deathbed and tells the local beauty that she \"m-m-makes his pee-pee-maker tingle\". I found this funny; others did not. At the film's premiere, a coalition of disability advocacy groups organised a picket, insisting that \"the R-word is hate speak\".</p> <p>\"I didn't see it coming,\" Stiller confesses. \"I mean, we had hundreds of test screenings and we handed out questionnaires afterwards. And the issue never came up until a week and a half before the film came out - and that was because someone saw the marketing material and took it out of context,\" he shrugs. \"If you take it out of context then of course you're going to have a problem. But I stand by the movie 100%. To me it's very clear that the joke is at the expense of the actors.\"</p> <p>All right then, let's look at the actors - and one actor in particular. Among its gallery of grotesques, Tropic Thunder makes room for a jaw-dropping cameo from none other than Tom Cruise. He plays a bald, boorish studio boss; a monstrous alpha dog who orders underlings to punch directors in the face and celebrates each success by dancing exuberantly in his office. It's hard not to be shocked by Cruise's physical transformation, this clownish change of gears, but Stiller insists it's not really so surprising. Good actors are good actors, whatever genre they're working in. Just look at Robert De Niro in Meet the Parents. \"Even someone really serious like Daniel Day-Lewis has a vein of humour in his work,\" he points out. \"That's what makes it human.\"</p> <p>Even so, the Cruise connection strikes me as significant, in part because the two actors have a long and intertwined history. Back when he was acting for Spielberg and auditioning for Stone, Stiller took time out to shoot a brief parody of Cruise's performance in The Color of Money. More recently he played the star's fawning body-double in another comedy short, Mission: Improbable. \"Yeah, that's right,\" he says. \"And fortunately, Tom saw those films the way they were intended. They were never mean-spirited. They were always affectionate because I've always been a fan.\"</p> <p>Judged on face value, these spoofs are funny because they feature a nerdish schlub who dares to impersonate a Hollywood heartthrob. But they're actually more sophisticated than that. In terms of looks, Cruise and Stiller are not wildly dissimilar. Both men stand a reported 5'7\" in their stockinged feet. They share the same gleaming white overbite, the same radioactive stare. Perhaps they even share a precarious sense of their own dignity - a quality that one man strives to protect and the other opts to play for laughs.</p> <p>What can this mean? I think back to Stiller's remark about good actors and different genres. But for a fork in the road, it's not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine a parallel universe, in which Stiller starred in Born on the Fourth of July and Cruise caught his dick in his zip on There's Something About Mary.</p> <p>I tell Stiller that he looks like Cruise, and he barks with laughter. I can't tell whether he's embarrassed or delighted. \"Right,\" he says. \"Right. I don't think so. I mean, I understand there's some area where it crosses over. But he's in a very different place from me. Whatever connection we have is based on my admiration for his career.\" By now he's practically spluttering. Cruise, he enthuses, is so smart, so committed. \"When he was coming on the scene he was sort of like a matinee idol, this sex symbol. But he chose to work with really interesting directors, and that's why his career has had that longevity. It's a hard business. You have to make choices. And I really admire these people who made their choices early on, who had that instinctual sense of where they wanted their careers to go.\"</p> <p>Was that what he did himself? \"No!\" says Stiller. \"That's what I'm talking about. No! I've had a trial-and-error career.\"</p> <p>He was born to a showbiz family, the son of the stand-up duo Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller. You could say that comedy is in his blood except that he has always seen himself, first and foremost, as a director. In the early days he bobbed between jobs and genres. He made a sketch show for MTV, directed Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy and played dramatic roles in the likes of Next of Kin, Permanent Midnight and Your Friends and Neighbors. </p> <p>\"It was a weird development process, and I was just trying to figure it out. Then all of a sudden you do a couple of comedies, and that's that. It defines who you are and how people see you. But I have to accept it,\" he shrugs. \"Even if that wasn't my plan. Even if I wish people didn't see me like that.\" He pauses to take a gulp of coffee; another hit to keep him buzzing.</p> <p>Maybe it's this tension that keeps him compelling. In later years, Stiller Sr enjoyed a grand Indian summer playing George Costanza's splenetic, hair-trigger dad in 28 episodes of Seinfeld. On-screen (and off it too), his son seems harried by the same barely contained irritation. Ben Stiller gives the impression of being a reluctant butt of the joke. His clown suit pinches and the jester bells ring infernally in his ears. Perversely, this makes him seem all the more funny. </p> <p>\"Darkness,\" Stiller muses. \"That's the direction I want to go in right now - both as a director and as an actor. I mean, I'll always go back to comedy because it's part of what I like to do. But there's this whole other side of me that I'm drawn to and that I just haven't been able to do. I have to get the balance right,\" he says. \"And it's hard. It's really hard.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"The business of Wall Street appears to be the cream of villainy,\" this paper declared in October 1929, as boom turned to bust. Such anger is necessary again today. The financial markets have been exposed as a vortex of artifice, a land of mirrors in which nothing was real and now everything is shattered. Government stands between citizens and disaster.</p> <p>The state is meeting the immediate crisis, here and in America, by bulldozing firebreaks in the firestorm - yesterday's move against short selling by the Financial Services Authority being one of the boldest examples to date. Threatened bodies, such as HBOS, have been nationalised or married off, while the Federal Reserve has been pumping money into the markets. But if that was the sum total of the response, progressive politicians would have missed an extraordinary opportunity to improve the world rather than simply manage it. As the Guardian reports today, there are grounds for thinking that the chancellor, Alistair Darling, now understands this. The current chaos will be followed by a chance to assert strength against a financial system that has abandoned the people it was created to serve. This is a moment that could define the difference between Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative - David Cameron exposing his colours this week by warning that overreaction could \"wreck\" the financial markets, as if they had not already been wrecked by indulgent underreaction and a lack of control.</p> <p><strong>Protection</strong></p> <p>The aim must be to rebalance the relationship between the City and society, not out of revenge or a disavowal of all markets, but to protect people, which is surely the basic duty of the state. There is a near unity of opinion that rules must be changed; that regulation has been weak; that the supposed masters of the universe in New York and London have been exposed as enfeebled spivs. The price of trusting too much in financial markets has been an intolerable volatility. Reform must aim to put in its place greater security. The knocking down of old barriers - on credit, on speculation, on what City firms are allowed to do - produced an artificial enrichment. Not all the consequences were bad. But finance has been indulged as other sectors of the normal economy have not been. It should not exist as a world in itself.</p> <p>The purpose of finance should be to finance real activities. The addiction to making a fast buck went beyond the City, of course - not least into Britain's housing market, where homeowners were transformed into speculators by a national cult of property. That has been encouraged by chancellors from Barber to Brown, and should now stop. But the much greater fault was to let the City rip. The impulse to hit back at the moneylenders in the temple is understandable. The truth is that there is no pain-free revenge to be had. The newly redundant money men at Lehman Brothers are already being joined by bank clerks from the Halifax, who played no part in bringing the crisis about.</p> <p>Most money is never printed as currency, but is created by private banks. When banks get nervous and lend less - as they are at the moment - the effect is the same as taking cash out of the economy. The disastrous contradictory spiral set in train by the collapse of the New York Bank of the United States in 1930 marked the real start of the Great Depression - a slump that saw one in four Americans out of a job. Galling as it may be to see the same bankers who were reckless in the good times benefiting from the official funds today, the only alternative would be to allow the current collapse to play out in the same disastrous manner. Likewise, the continuation of the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme - which, for a price, allows banks to swap their assets for rock-solid Treasury bonds - is unavoidable. The Bank's governor, Mervyn King, was wrong to resist this. The authorities must - and in the end will - do what is required to avoid monetary contraction. </p> <p><strong>Slump</strong></p> <p>What is much less clear, however, is whether central bankers and finance ministries have grasped the lessons of the less acute but more protracted Japanese slump that began in 1991 and, arguably, continues to this day. The trigger, then as now, was the bursting of a property bubble which had, some said, made the square mile of land underneath Tokyo's Imperial Palace more valuable than the entire state of California. Understandably concerned to avoid re-creating the speculative madness, the Bank of Japan dithered before cutting rates. By the time it acted, prices were sliding down so fast that families and firms could not be persuaded to stop hoarding cash.</p> <p>There is a parallel here with the Bank of England's preoccupation with the current blip in consumer inflation. Wednesday's sharp rise in unemployment confirmed that the real economy is now slowing so fast that inflation will soon start to dive - and especially so when, at 3.5%, the rise in earnings continues to lag behind that in prices. The Bank must seize the initiative and cut rates sharply and soon. </p> <p>Looking ahead, it will also be necessary to refashion the framework for policy - in both monetary and fiscal terms. Suddenly revising the Bank's 2% inflation target in the midst of today's market mayhem would signal that the government had dispensed with all discipline, and so could trigger a run on the pound. But ministers must revisit the target when calm returns, replacing it with one which would stop discretion from being hampered by world commodity prices which the Bank cannot control. </p> <p><strong>Embarrassing</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown will also need to rewrite his fiscal rules, embarrassing as he will find it. Yesterday's 70% year-on-year rise in the August deficit confirms that he is already on course to break this self-imposed overdraft limit. He can only comply with it by tightening policy in a dangerous manner. His overriding duty is instead to rewrite the arbitrary rules.</p> <p>Alongside cure we must have prevention, so financial hubris cannot precipitate nemesis again. First, as the FSA has rightly recognised, it is time to tame short selling - the practice of borrowing shares and selling them on, in the hope of buying them back at a profit after they have taken a dive. By allowing investors to target failing firms, it can work to discipline failing management. But it can also drive frenzied nosedives in valuation, apropos of not very much. As of last night, and until January at least, the FSA has banned the shorting of financial stocks. This welcome move will discourage speculation in banks - speculation that events have shown is often at the expense of the taxpayer. Following the American lead, there will also be new rules to force investors taking short positions to come clean about them more quickly. </p> <p>Second, in the light of the uncertainties created by the unwinding of the vast Lehman balance sheet, a compulsory insurance scheme should be introduced to ensure that transactions entered into are honoured; at the same time anonymous trading should be banned.</p> <p>Third, there needs to be limits on the piling of debt on top of dodgy derivatives - a 50% minimum margin should do the trick. And there would be wisdom in making capital requirements on banks countercyclical - forcing them to put more money away in the good times, while freeing them up to lend more liberally in downturns. Achieving this would require an international deal that would be difficult to broker. But overturning a regulatory race to the bottom is a prize worth fighting for.</p> <p><strong>Dogmatic delusions</strong></p> <p>Cultural changes are just as important as this shopping list of specifics. Criminal inquiries have already been launched in the US, and could usefully clarify ideas about financiers' responsibilities in the UK. Maintaining opacity about who will get bailed out is essential to ensuring banks cannot assume that the authorities will always pick them back up if a frenzied debt dance leads to collapse. Businesses need to be more focused on their core expertise. Banks, such as Northern Rock, and insurers, such as AIG, got distracted from what they were good at. It was hard not to in a climate where pushing latter-day Ponzi schemes was more profitable. </p> <p>Avoiding boom and bust is important, but it is not the only issue. Society must invest in activities more productive than temporarily profitable games of financial pass-the-parcel-bomb. A shift away from snapshot market-based accountancy standards - which make the strength of balance sheets entirely dependent on shifting spirits in the marketplace - could foster a saner investment climate. </p> <p>No menu of instant prescriptions can fix everything that has gone wrong - not least because it is only after the current series of tidal waves has stopped and retreated that we will be able to assess the full damage. But already it is clear that what lies behind them is the dogmatic delusion that the invisible hand of the market reliably transforms private greed into public good. The crisis has exposed the reality that much less is truly private than is often assumed - from Northern Rock to Freddie Mac, the crisis has transformed private liabilities into public debt. The reality is that in a modern market economy, as in every society, the prosperity of each is interconnected with the prosperity of others. No man is an island, and - it turns out - no bank is either. From innovation to pollution, the private decisions of private firms affect the public good - whether for good or ill. Interdependence is a hard fact of economic life, and economic governance needs to be revolutionised to respect it.</p>",
  "<p>There was one major difference between the Captain Quint played by Robert Shaw in Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster Jaws, and Frank Mundus, the shark fisherman on whom the character was thought to be based. Mundus, who has died aged 82, was far more flamboyant.</p> <p>Sporting a diamond-stud earring, shark-tooth dagger and matching necklace, often with the nails of his big toes painted red and green, for port and starboard, Mundus was a fixture in the Long Island port of Montauk, a self-promoter whose role as the \"Monster Man\" did not always endear him to his fellow fishermen, but whose reputation as the world's foremost catcher of sharks attracted hordes of tourists to the once-sleepy town.</p> <p>Born in Long Branch, New Jersey, Mundus contracted a marrow infection in a broken arm which left it stunted. When his father, a steamfitter, moved the family to Brooklyn, doctors encouraged his parents to take him to the beach to exercise by swimming. He fell in love with the ocean and, when he was old enough, left school to work as a freight handler, and then as a crewman on charter fishing boats. </p> <p>In 1951 he bought his own boat, the 42ft Cricket, named because friends thought he resembled Jiminy Cricket in Disney's Pinocchio. Bluefish were the prize sport off Long Island, but when Mundus caught one of the many sharks swarming around, someone called it \"a monster\", and he began a new business. \"I started shark fishing as a joke,\" he recalled. \"I called it 'monster fishing' to attract customers. It was poor man's big-game fishing.\"</p> <p>His notoriety grew when, in 1961, he harpooned a great white just off the popular beach at Amagansett, watched by hundreds of beach-goers. He caught another, but claimed that \"the local chamber of commerce kept it hush-hush because they didn't want to scare the tourists\". Three years later, with two sharks already brought in, he was battling a third on a reel when he harpooned a fourth, another great white that weighed more than 2,000kg (around 4,500lb). The publicity attracted Peter Benchley to Mundus, and the novelist, who published Jaws in 1974 and co-wrote the screenplay for the movie, made many trips on the Cricket. </p> <p>Although Benchley praised Mundus's skill, calling him \"one of the last, great colourful fishermen\", he always insisted Mundus was not the inspiration for Quint, who was a composite character. In the sense that Quint drew on Melville's Captain Ahab from Moby-Dick, and Herman Wouk's Captain Queeg from The Caine Mutiny, Benchley was, of course, correct. But any number of Montauk locals testified that Mundus's influence on Quint was obvious, not least his habit of tying empty barrels to the harpoons he launched at the sharks.</p> <p>Mundus offended much of the Montauk fleet by shooting sharks to finish them off, or harpooning whales to use their blubber in the chum he spread to attract sharks. But as sport fishing became more ecological, Mundus began to use more shark-friendly circle hooks, participated in tagging, and started catch and release excursions. In 1986 he made his greatest catch, using rod and reel to capture a record 17ft great white, weighing 1,554kg (3,427lb). But after the US coastguard established written exams for fishing captains, Mundus refused to be tested. In 1991 he retired to a lemon farm in Hawaii, where he raised pigs and sheep with his second wife, an Englishwoman, Jeanette Hughes, whom he had met through correspondence and married in 1988.</p> <p>He returned to Montauk each summer as a celebrity host on boats skippered by others, billed as the world's greatest shark fisherman. His boat, Cricket II, had been refurbished by film producers interested in shooting a documentary, and last year he captured a shark whose tail had knocked him to the deck, using his gaff to hook it and lift it aboard. </p> <p>Mundus suffered two heart attacks and died in Hawaii soon after returning from his annual trip to Montauk. He is survived by his wife and three children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. </p> <p>He always regretted not being acknowledged by the creators of Jaws. \"All I ever wanted was a thank you,\" he said. \"If [Benchley] just would have thanked me, my business would have increased. Everything he wrote was true, except I didn't get eaten by the big shark. I dragged him in.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Frank Louis Mundus, fisherman, born October 21 1925; died September 10 2008</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of children are watching TV adverts for food high in fat, salt and sugar despite measures designed to prevent them doing so, the consumer watchdog Which? says today. </p> <p>In a spot check on children's viewing, it found that just four of the 20 programmes with the largest under-16 audiences were covered by rules from broadcasting regulator Ofcom. This was because the rules are based on the proportion of child viewers for each programme, not actual numbers, meaning that series such as The Simpsons and SpongeBob SquarePants are covered but shows like Beat the Star and Emmerdale are not, despite being watched by far more children, according to Which?</p> <p>The Ofcom rules, which are under review, apply to the main TV channels, with commercial children's channels having to comply by January 1 next year. Programmes of particular appeal to children are defined as those watched by 20% more children than the proportion of four- to 16-year-olds that make up the general viewing public.

  "<h2>Call for emergency reform of food aid programmes</h2> <p>The number of people without food is increasing despite rich countries spending billions of pounds a year on emergency feeding programmes, one of the world's largest humanitarian groups has reported. Care International calls for a radical reform of the UN's international food aid system. By 2015 nearly \u00a3100bn will have been spent on emergencies since world leaders pledged to halve world hunger in 1999. The current system of countries waiting to act until food shortages become crises risks increasing malnutrition. \"Donors are failing to fund preventative action adequately,\" the report says. <br><strong>John Vidal </strong></p> <h2>Second riot at Tijuana prison leaves 19 dead</h2> <p>A second riot in three days at an infamous Tijuana prison has left 19 people dead and 12 injured, officials say. Baja California's public safety secretary, Daniel de la Rosa, said soldiers and federal police regained control of the overcrowded La Mesa prison, just across the US border from San Diego, on Wednesday. He added that authorities were transferring 200 inmates to other state prisons and were increasing security. Family members say the inmates rioted again because they have not been given food or water since Sunday, when a separate riot led to the deaths of at least three inmates. <br><strong>Associated Press in Tijuana</strong></p> <h2>US soldier jailed over killings of four Iraqis</h2> <p>A US soldier was sentenced to seven months in prison yesterday after pleading guilty to conspiracy to murder in the killing of four Iraqi prisoners who were bound, blindfolded, shot and dumped in a Baghdad canal last year. The relatively lenient sentence for Specialist Belmor Ramos was part of a deal in which he will testify against others alleged to have been involved in the killings. Prosecutors said the killings were in retribution for casualties in Ramos's unit. Ramos, 23, of Clearfield, Utah, told a judge at his court martial in Germany that he stood guard as the men were killed. <br><strong>Associated Press in Vilseck</strong></p> <h2>Dairy recall after territory finds banned chemical</h2> <p>Hong Kong has recalled a Chinese dairy's products after tests discovered the same chemical found in tainted baby milk that killed and sickened thousands in China. The government found the banned industrial chemical melamine in eight of 30 samples from Yili Industrial Group, said the territory's food safety centre, including milk powder that has killed up to four babies and sickened 6,200 others in mainland China.

Families of other victims have asked a judge to rule on opening the grave, in southern Spain. The family of the poet, who was 38 when he died, had always opposed a search. Laura Garc\u00eda Lorca, the poet's niece, said the family would prefer to leave the grave untouched but \"will accept whatever decision is taken without objection\". <br><strong>Associated Press in Madrid</strong></p>",
  "<p>At least seven African countries or regions have reduced malaria deaths by half following a drive to protect people through the use of bed nets, treat those who fall sick and eliminate mosquitoes, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.</p> <p>The success stories include Eritrea, Rwanda and the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe, which are not only managing to prevent and treat malaria but also have good data on cases and deaths. In a report on the global burden of the disease, published yesterday, the WHO says more countries may be reducing death rates, but do not yet have the statistics to prove it.</p> <p>\"With dramatic increases in funding and intense momentum towards reducing the malaria burden in recent years we have a greater need for reliable information and analysis,\" said WHO director general Margaret Chan. \"Progress in malaria control has accelerated dramatically since 2006, especially in the wake of the UN secretary general's call for universal malaria control coverage by the end of 2010.\"</p> <p>But the report, which covers the years 2004 to 2006, estimates that there were 247m cases in 2006 and an estimated 881,000 deaths. Nearly all who died (91%) were in Africa and 85% were under five.</p> <p>There is now general agreement on measures to fight malaria but, particularly in the worst-hit areas of Africa, drugs, bed nets and sprays are slow to get to where they are needed and far short of the 80% target for coverage set by the WHO.</p> <p>Surveys in 18 African countries show that 34% of households own an insecticide-treated bed net, but even in those homes that have them they are not always used to protect the most vulnerable - only 23% of children and 27% of pregnant women slept under a net.</p>",
  "<p>The success of the Motown \"hit factory\", founded in the 1960s by Berry Gordy, was built on the creative contributions of a large team of songwriters, musicians and producers - of which Norman Whitfield, who has died aged 67 of complications associated with diabetes, was arguably among the half-dozen most vital members. He co-wrote such classics as I Heard It Through the Grapevine, War, and Papa Was a Rollin' Stone, and among those whose records he produced were Gladys Knight, Marvin Gaye and the Temptations.</p> <p>Whitfield was born in Harlem, where his main achievement was to become a skilled pool player. He told later interviewers that his family had settled in Detroit after their car broke down there while returning from an aunt's funeral in California. After high school, he exchanged pool for music and produced records for the small Thelma Records label, including one by Richard Street, a future member of the Temptations. He also hung around the Motown studios, observing the production process until Gordy was persuaded to give him a job. </p> <p>A former car worker, Gordy borrowed the idea of a quality control department from the automobile industry, and in 1961 Whitfield became its first head. He was paid $15 a week to lend a critical ear to new recordings by Motown staff, a job he said \"consisted of being totally honest about what records you were listening to\". He graded the tracks for Gordy's monthly staff meeting, where decisions were made on which should be released.</p> <p>Soon dissatisfied with quality control, Whitfield fought to be allowed to create records himself. This involved competing with such established figures as Smokey Robinson, but he got his first opportunities in 1964 with lesser Motown groups, co-writing and producing Needle in a Haystack by the Velvelettes and Too Many Fish in the Sea by the Marvelettes. These records brought him the chance to work with the Temptations, already one of Motown's elite groups. After one of Robinson's productions flopped, Whitfield took over for Ain't Too Proud to Beg, a No 1 R&amp;B hit in 1966 that was later recorded by the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>For the next couple of years, he and Robinson shared production duties until Whitfield became the Temptations' sole producer in 1968. This heralded a six-year run of scintillating records with the group, many written with Barrett Strong, whose 1960 hit Money was covered by the Beatles in 1963.</p> <p>Strong and Whitfield skilfully merged newer soul and psychedelic influences with Motown's traditional instrumental and vocal strengths. Although Whitfield had his overall concept of each song, it would be created as a studio recording through controlled experimentation and improvisation by the musicians under the producer's guidance. \"It took a lot of research and I really consider myself somewhat of a perfectionist,\" he told writer Nelson George. \"I don't like to speculate and I don't like to take chances with my guys.\"</p> <p>A typical example of Whitfield's Motown-soul approach was I Wish It Would Rain, a 1968 Temptations hit, which found the group's Jimmy Ruffin emoting like a southern soul virtuoso with seagull and thunderstorm sound effects added by Whitfield. But the greatest of Whitfield and Strong's songs was undoubtedly I Heard It Through the Grapevine, first released by Gladys Knight and the Pips in a tambourine-driven version in 1967 and recreated in equally dynamic versions in 1968 with Marvin Gaye and the Temptations.</p> <p>The psychedelic Cloud Nine in 1968 (Motown's first Grammy-winning record) was in many ways a homage to Sly Stone, who Whitfield said showed him that record production was \"the science of sound\". This was followed by Psychedelic Shack and Ball of Confusion (both 1970) and Papa Was a Rollin' Stone (1972). The lyrics of these songs concerned social and political issues of the day, though not always so coherently as War, the Whitfield-Strong protest anthem memorably sung with strategic grunts by Edwin Starr in 1970.</p> <p>By the mid-1970s, Motown had moved its operations to California and many of its leading figures had left. In 1974, Whitfield joined the exodus after Warner Bros offered to finance his own record label. He took with him his last Motown \"acid-soul\" group, the Undisputed Truth, but the Whitfield label initially yielded few hits. His greatest post-Motown success came when he was asked to create the soundtrack for the 1976 film Car Wash. He wrote the lyrics of the disco-styled title song on a Kentucky Fried Chicken wrapper after watching a basketball game and used Rose Royce, a group of former Motown singers and musicians, to perform it. Both song and film were massive hits, and Whitfield produced several more hits for the group.</p> <p>In the 1980s, he went into semi-retirement, occasionally appearing at music industry functions. He returned to the spotlight in 2005 when he pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges. The case revealed that even in the late 1990s he had been earning more than $500,000 a year from royalties as his songs were reissued, re-recorded and used in more than 50 film soundtracks. He was sentenced to six months in prison and fined $25,000, but was spared jail in favour of home detention on account of his failing health.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Norman Jesse Whitfield, songwriter and record producer, born May 12 1941; died September 16 2008</p>",
  "<p>The big mystery is about to be solved. We will soon discover whether those dastardly short-sellers and hedge funds contributed to the big falls in banks' share prices.</p> <p>The deal for the short-sellers is this: new short positions in financial stocks are now banned in the UK. You can either remove existing positions today, or you can leave them in place and reveal them to the world next Tuesday. If you choose the latter, you will be a tabloid villain on Wednesday.</p> <p>It should be excellent sport. An almighty \"bear squeeze\" - forcing the sellers to close their bets - is almost guaranteed today. At 11pm last night, unofficial prices suggested the FTSE 100 index would open up 200 points, thanks also to a late rally on Wall Street last night which, in turn, was partly inspired by the Financial Services Authority's clampdown.</p> <p>Today could be painful for many hedge funds. Few tears will be shed for the shorters, of course. Profiting from falling prices is often regarded as unsportsmanlike behaviour in normal times. In the past few weeks, it has come to be viewed as damaging to the health of the financial system.</p> <p>Short-sellers will protest that they have merely been making informed investment decisions about the rotten state of the financial system, but they can't doubt that the mood has turned against them. They have been demonised not only in newspapers, but in the City. Senior voices have warned that the temple is being torn down from within, never mind the fact some of the pillars look fundamentally weak.</p> <p>Will a temporary ban on short-selling work? Well, something similar did in the crash of 1907, and it's worth telling the tale for the parallels with today's panicky markets. The story is told in Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, the classic portrayal of the life of Jesse Livermore, perhaps the greatest stock market speculator. Livermore earned his nickname, the \"Boy Plunger\", for his ability to profit from falling prices. In 1907, he was running up huge profits by betting on a plunge. He was in control of the market.</p> <p>\"I had enormous paper profits and the certainty that all that I had to do smash prices still more was to send in orders to sell ten thousand shares each of Union Pacific [a big railroad company] and of a half dozen other good dividend-paying stocks, and what would follow would be simply hell. It seemed to me that the panic that would be precipitated would be of such intensity and character that the board of governors would deem it advisable to close the [Stock] Exchange.\"</p> <p>Sound familiar? This week we saw opinions voiced that the even the mighty houses of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs could be brought down by panic.</p> <p>In 1907 John Pierpont Morgan - who, in the days before the Federal Reserve, in effect controlled the US banking system - sent a message to Livermore via a friend: \"The market can't stand much more pressure. As it is, it will be an immensely difficult task to avert a devastating panic. Appeal to your friend's patriotism. This is a case where a man has to work for the benefit of all.\"</p> <p>That also sounds familiar. The FSA chairman, Callum McCarthy, also appealed to the common good when announcing the probation on short-selling last night: \"It is designed to have a calming effect - something which the equity markets for financial firms badly need. I hope practitioners will support both the ambition and the chosen means of achieving it.\"</p> <p>Livermore did lay off, although his motives weren't purely altruistic. He was worried that the \"blood-letting\" would damage his chances of making profits on the way back up. But the market recovered and confidence returned. The psychology changed for the better.</p> <p>The parallel with 1907 may be complete nonsense. Today's markets are different. Banks are not collapsing purely because of panic. There are genuine concerns about solvency and liquidity in many cases. Many banks have been run irresponsibly and some do not deserve to survive.</p> <p>It's also possible that banning short-selling could back-fire. It could send a message that the authorities are so panicked by events that everybody else should panic too. So the FSA is taking a risk.</p> <p>Maybe its hand was swayed after it saw the 15% fall in Lloyds TSB's share price yesterday, a day after the bank agreed to buy HBOS. Perhaps it was the plunge in HBOS shares on Monday, just before news of the deal broke. Either way, the FSA and the government will know the measure will be popular. Taking shots at short-sellers is bound to be applauded by the crowd, as Livermore would have known: he also got a terrible press.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The model Elle Macpherson was this week pilloried by the tabloids for bicycling in a London street without a helmet and with her (helmeted) son on her handlebars. \"Elle on wheels,\" cried the Mail. \"What the Elle are you doing?\" screamed the Mirror with an editorial titled \"Elle to pay\". Even the Times demanded a response to her behaviour from the gods of health and safety. The answer from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents was a predictable howl: \"Illegal and dangerous!\"</p> <p>The truth is the opposite. Macpherson was probably the safest cyclist in London that day. Like the mayor, Boris Johnson, she is signed up (I guess by instinct) to the Wilde-Adams theory of compensatory risk assessment. By not wearing a helmet, she lowers her risk threshold and thus rides more carefully. She commendably cycles rather than drives a car and protects her child, who cannot manage his own risk. The society should give her a medal, not insult her. The press were idiots.</p> <p>By chance, this week sees the publication of another tome in the mountain of evidence that Britain's safety culture is making us increasingly unsafe. Tom Vanderbilt's Traffic collates a mass of evidence about how we drive cars and use roads. It demonstrates the extent of mendacious brain-washing inflicted on the public by health-and-safety lawyers, bureaucrats and sellers of expensive equipment.</p> <p>Vanderbilt, like Gerald Wilde, Hans Monderman and John Adams before him, rests his case on the thesis that stripping people of responsibility for safety makes them take more risks, not fewer. Traffic safety is concerned not with dehumanised automatons but with people, and is a balance between authority and personal freedom.</p> <p>Adams's \"theory of risk compensation\" states that people push their behaviour to a given level of danger. If they are made to feel safer - through driving a big car, wearing a harness or riding a motorbike in a helmet - they shift their risk threshold to a higher level of danger. The old experiment still works: increase your speed to 80mph, undo your seat belt and see what you do next. You brake. Likewise mobile phone users instinctively slow to a crawl, dangerous but less so than driving at 80mph.</p> <p>The accumulation of statistics is overwhelming. Helmets, like seat belts, somehow do not seem to reduce accidents. Last year Norway's centre for transport research, in rejecting compulsory helmets, noted the \"increased risk per cycling kilometre for cyclists wearing helmets, in Australia and New Zealand at around 14%\". It also noted a consequent reduction in cycling use of 22%.</p> <p>A British study showed that motorists instinctively give cyclists without a helmet a wider berth. Drivers are no more stupid than riders. Eye contact makes driving more intelligent, which is why convertibles reportedly have fewer accidents. For every cyclist who claims \"my helmet saved my life\", there are two for whom wearing a helmet led them to risk it.</p> <p>The world's most celebrated cycling country, the Netherlands, has just 1% helmet use and has the safest cycling record anywhere. It has one third the cycling death rate of Western Australia, which has the most draconian law. The Dutch Cycling Council declares that helmets \"increase cycling speeds and encourage riskier cycling behaviour ...They also reduce the care motorists give to cyclists\". The dispatch rider careering through a red light may think his helmet makes him safer than the unguarded old lady on a sit-up-and-beg style bicycle, but he is wrong.</p> <p>Ever since the government suppressed the 1981 Isles report for suggesting that compulsory seats belts might cost lives by encouraging speeding, the psychology of road use has been treated as anathema. The idea that signs, lights, cameras and \"controlled\" pedestrian crossings might distract driving vision and decrease safety is intolerable to those who love regimenting others. A mother nosing her way on a bike through the traffic must be more dangerous than if she were careering at twice the speed in an armoured buggy - whatever the facts may say.</p> <p>Traffic engineers regard cars as crazed robots to be freed from human frailty. Theirs is a Fritz Lang metropolis in which tiny pods move silently through three dimensions and people are ants. They have cocooned us in super-safe cars that we drive too fast. They think they are reducing congestion with parking restrictions, lanes, roundabouts and gyratories, but cancel any such benefit by making journeys twice as long as they need be with one-way streets and traffic lights. The latter waste road space, increase travel time and burn millions of tonnes of unnecessary carbon.</p> <p>Traffic management must be the most uneconomic, anti-human and carbon-guzzling regulation on earth. Pedestrians are corralled and confined by fences. Streets are polluted by forests of signs, preventing drivers from their prime task of watching and showing consideration to other road users. We put up with this nonsense in the naive belief that it must be doing us good. It is not.</p> <p>Vanderbilt is a follower of the \"shared space movement\" pioneered by the Dutch engineer, Monderman, whose work is now near standard across mainland Europe. There are 4,000 \"naked street\" schemes in Germany alone, where lights and restrictions are minimal and pedestrians, cyclists and cars tolerate each other at all but the most difficult crossings.</p> <p>Rather than accelerating and braking down a regulated street, cars tend to move at under 20mph, informally policed by pavement design and the uncertainty of sharing space with pedestrians and cyclists. That eyes are the best traffic policemen was a Monderman maxim. In shared space, accidents fall and journey times actually improve, often by extraordinary amounts.</p> <p>At Monderman's much-publicised Drachten intersection in the Netherlands, where fountains replace posts, fences, lights and kerbstones, the chief menace is said to be visiting traffic engineers repeating the master's trick of walking blindfold and backwards through the streaming traffic, which somehow gives way but never stops. Naked streets have even proved safer for the disabled.</p> <p>The one English example is the \"half-naked\" Kensington high street. Cleared of barriers and safety clutter, its accident rate has fallen by 44% in two years. Only in Britain would such a boon be \"experimental\", fought tooth and nail by safety engineers in league with contractors and, I must assume, undertakers. There is hardly a street in Britain not being upheaved for some pedestrian segregation scheme, each aimed at reducing personal risk and thus increasing the chance of an accident.</p> <p>All vehicles are people in disguise, negotiating the use of common space with each other. They must never be induced to delegate that obligation to signs and machines. They certainly must not think themselves safer than others, or they will behave with less consideration for others as a result.</p> <p>Most people with whom I discuss these ideas look at me with blank amazement. It just cannot be true. The control of \"the driving experience\" must surely make it safer and not more dangerous. If the facts suggest otherwise, they must be wrong. Control always has the best tunes.</p> <p>Galileo had the same trouble with the Inquisition. I say give Elle Macpherson a Galileo medal.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Any philosopher will tell you that revenge isn't sweet - it's ruinous. But how often do the wounded, jealous, downtrodden or plain infuriated find succour in philosophy, rather than in dreams and acts of vengeance? Writers are in a better position to retaliate against slings and arrows than the rest of us, by attacking their enemies in prose or song: it's bloodless, and earns cash to boot. In a study of revenge tragedy, the critic John Kerrigan even declared, \"Vengeance is at the root of what many people now think they are doing when they write, or sing, or just strive for 'achievement'.\"</p> <p>There has already been a playlist dedicated to hatchet jobs, songs that are themselves acts of revenge. This week's list is inspired more by Jacobean drama, those maniacal bloodfests in which injured characters brood, plot and finally throttle the law with their bare hands. Kate Bush, no stranger to theatricality, sets the stage thrillingly, depicting a woman who marries the man who killed her lover, so she can slaughter him on their wedding night.</p> <p>Buenas Tardes Amigo may be an absurd mariachi pastiche, but its tale of a son revenging his brother's murder is gripping - especially when he reveals his real motive. The Triffids never tell us what prompted their protagonist's killing spree, but as flames consume his home town, they make mass murder sound unnervingly romantic.</p> <p>Ice-T expounds a seemingly straightforward \"eye for an eye\" manifesto, but underlying his declaration of revenge's necessity is an understanding of its dangerous cyclical nature. If only more people would follow the lead of Waylon Jennings, who revels in nothing more than a \"sweet mental revenge\", imagining the downfall of his ex-love and the ex-friend who stole her away. Or, perhaps, the abused wife in Maddy Prior's elegant version of Stitch in Time: she merely beats her drunken husband with a frying pan, making him a better man in the process.</p> <p>Thankfully, few singers go to the extremes of the blues artist Pat Hare, who, having recorded this slithery threat to do away with his no-good woman, went ahead and did just that. In 1962, he killed his girlfriend, as well as the policeman sent to investigate, earning himself 16 years in prison. In case that doesn't convince you that revenge doesn't pay, here come the Beatles with the cautionary tale of Rocky Raccoon: he pulls a gun on his rival in love, only to be shot himself. Then there is the experience of the teenager in Nightmare, doomed to be haunted for ever by the screams of the girl she accidentally kills in a fight. The song is as electrifying and outrageous as 1960s girl-group melodrama gets.</p> <p>There is only one conclusion to draw from all this. The best revenge anyone can have is to rise above their adversary. That's what Beyonc\u00e9 does, stylishly, commandingly, witheringly, on Survivor. Vengeance as achievement, it seems, really does taste sweet.</p> <h2>This week's playlist </h2> <p><strong>1. The Wedding List </strong>Kate Bush <br><strong>2.

  "<p>Man, Timothy Egan of the NY Times is good. Check him out <a href=\"http://egan.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/moo/\">today</a>, in a post pithily and acerbically called \"Moo\":</p> <blockquote> <p>What [Palin's] critics don't understand is that crony capitalism is how things are done in Alaska. They reward failure in the Last Frontier<br>state. In that sense, it's not unlike like Wall Street's treatment of<br>C.E.O.'s who run companies into the ground.</p> <p>Look at Carly Fiorina, John McCain's top economic surrogate \u2014 if you can<br>find her this week, after the news and her narrative fused in a negative<br>way. Dismissed as head of Hewlett-Packard after the company's stock<br>plunged and nearly 20,000 workers were let go, she was rewarded with $44<br>million in compensation. Sweet!</p> </blockquote> <p>And this:</p> <blockquote> <p>As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, Governor Palin overturned a decision to shutter a money-losing, state-run creamery \u2014 Matanuska Maid \u2014 when her friends in Wasilla complained about losing their subsidies. She fired the board that recommended closure, and replaced it with one run by a childhood friend. After six months, and nearly $1 million in fresh losses, the board came to the same conclusion as the earlier one: Matanuska Maid could not operate without being a perpetual burden on the taxpayers.</p> <p>This is Heckuva-Job-Brownie government, Far North version...</p> <p>...And let's not talk about voodoo infrastructure without one more mention<br>of the bridge that Palin has yet to tell the truth about. The plan was<br>to get American taxpayers to pay for a span that would be 80 feet higher<br>than the Brooklyn Bridge, and about 20 feet short of the Golden Gate \u2014<br>all to serve a tiny airport with a half-dozen or so flights a day and a<br>perfectly good five-minute ferry.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well done. Slowly, the bill of fraudery is coming due...<br></p>",
  "<p>Venezuela's president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has flouted human rights, persecuted opponents and undermined democracy during his decade in power, according to a damning new report.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog, today accused the socialist revolutionary of betraying a promise to shore up the rule of law and turn Venezuela into a progressive beacon.</p> <p>The report claimed Ch\u00e1vez's government had taken over the courts and cowed the media, trade unions and civil society, leaving the South American oil giant dominated by an overmighty executive. \"Discrimination on political grounds has been a defining feature of the Ch\u00e1vez presidency.. (as) has been an open disregard for the principle of separation of powers.\"</p> <p>The 230-page report, titled A Decade Under Ch\u00e1vez: Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela, is likely to fuel Caracas's suspicion that the United States is waging a campaign against it.</p> <p>Government officials were not immediately available to rebut the allegations but the Washington-based Venezuela Information Office, which promotes the government's view, said Human Rights Watch was biased.</p> <p>\"Their reports on Venezuela have typically been politicised. They don't highlight real advances,\" said Olivia Goumbri, a spokeswoman. Lavish spending of oil revenues on social programmes, for instance, had boosted human rights by reducing poverty and illiteracy.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said Venezuela's worst setback in the past decade was a 2002 coup that briefly replaced Ch\u00e1vez, an anti-democratic putsch backed by the Bush administration. \"Fortunately it lasted only two days. Unfortunately the Ch\u00e1vez government has exploited it ever since to justify policies that have degraded the country's democracy,\" said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the advocacy group's Americas director.</p> <p>The report accused the government of sacrificing basic guarantees enshrined in a 1999 constitution - which Ch\u00e1vez had championed - to further its political agenda. It allegedly \"neutralised the judiciary\" by packing the supreme court with allies and undermined freedom of expression by toughening penalties for criminal defamation and bullying private media into softening criticism.</p> <p>The report also accused the government of blacklisting opponents from state agencies and the national oil company, notably through a database of those who signed a petition against the president. It alleged that trade unions had been emasculated and that human rights activists had been harassed.</p> <p>\"Ch\u00e1vez has actively sought to project himself as a champion of democracy (but) Venezuela will not achieve real and sustained progress toward strengthening its democracy\u2026so long as its government continues to flout the human rights principles enshrined in its own constitution.\"</p> <p>The watchdog has issued more scathing reports about human rights abuses in Venezuela's neighbour, Colombia, which is waging a US-backed crackdown on leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers. Steve Ellner, a professor at Venezuela's University of the East, said Human Rights Watch overlooked the opposition's role in polarising Venezuela, not least by refusing to accept the president's legitimacy and electoral mandates.</p> <p>\"I would say the report is exaggerated. It fails to place events in their context,\" said the author of Rethinking Venezuelan Politics: class conflict and the Ch\u00e1vez phenomenon. \"Put yourself in the shoes of Ch\u00e1vistas. They are convinced the opposition will stop short of nothing to get rid of Ch\u00e1vez.\"<br></p>",

  "<p>Aston Villa made a stuttering start to their Uefa Cup campaign before limping to a 3-1 win over Bulgarian side Litex Lovech. Martin O'Neill's side had to come from behind after trailing for most of the first half and even when the Bulgarians had two men sent off in the second Villa never looked completely in control of the match.</p> <p>Ivelin Popov scored for Litex after just ten minutes, curling a free-kick around the Villa wall and a static Brad Friedel.

  "<p>A mixture of messages is being recieved from the two men now most publicly identified with the 2012 Games and their prospects for success. Seb Coe, the face of Games evangelism, has <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4765181.ece\">declared</a> himself not cowed by China's imperious announcement of its global power: \"Beijing has delivered a spectacular games and we will also deliver a spectacular games.\" By contrast, Boris Johnson has spoken of a \"more intimate\" Games - the \"language of estate agents,\" he calls this - and, in keeping with his unofficial role as financial good housekeeper, made a firm pledge about sticking to the budget. </p> <p>Can London 2012 be intimate and spectacular at the same time? I suppose it can, though given the deepening economic gloom it might prove necessary to draw on the long British history of ingenuity if the next Games are to leave a mark on Olympic history. In this respect, Boris and Seb could do worse than learn some lessons from the two previous London Olympics, in 1908 and 1948. Both were staged under difficult circumstances. The former were held at a hurriedly-built White City because Italy, the intended host, was forced to concentrate instead on rebuilding Naples following an eruption by Mount Vesuvius. The latter took place at Wembley in the harsh aftermath of the war. </p> <p>A feature of the London Olympiad a century ago was the inventiveness of the powers that be. After <a href=\"http://www.dorandopietri.it/biografia_en.asp\">Dorando Pietri</a> was deprived of victory in the marathon because officials helped him cross the finish line, Edward VII's consort Queen Alexandra gave him a special gold cup to make up for it. The marathon's length too was adjusted in light of circumstances: it was lengthened at one end so it would start at Windsor Castle and at the other so it would end in front of <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon59.html\">the king</a>. Here, surely, are precedents that could be called on should events in Stratford start to disappoint. Why not award our own prizes? Why not invent our own rules? Such interventions might not add to the spectacle, but they'd certainly be memorable. </p> <p>By 1948 there was less scope for such creative tampering, and not much cash to throw around either. We mustered a 35-foot flagpole, a Royal Artillery gun salute and 2,500 pigeons to release, but it wasn't much of a show compared with the Games preceding it. Still, those were Hitler's in 1936, and I know which of the two I feel fondest towards.

  "<p>The Bush administration today accused Russia of aggression and authoritarianism, claiming its main aim in invading Georgia last month was to overthrow the country's president, Mikheil Saakashvili.</p> <p>In the strongest attack on a resurgent Moscow since it routed the Georgian military in a five-day war last month, the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin, had launched Moscow on a path to pariah status.</p> <p>The US broadside came as attempts to deploy scores of international military monitors in Georgian conflict zones collapsed when Russia refused to allow the observers, from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to patrol in South Ossetia, the breakaway region of northern Georgia bordering Russia.</p> <p>Weeks of negotiations at the OSCE's headquarters in Vienna ended in failure when the Russians stiffened the terms for the proposed deployments to rule out any international presence in South Ossetia, western diplomats said.</p> <p>The OSCE already had agreement to send 100 military observers to Georgia. Talks over their mandate were gridlocked when the US and European allies rejected the Russian terms.</p> <p>Finland, the president of the OSCE, said the negotiations \"have not brought any result. There was no basis for consensus ... there is no point in continuing negotiations in Vienna.\"</p> <p>The OSCE has eight military monitors in Georgia who are mandated to operate in South Ossetia, but the Russians have not allowed them to enter the contested region since the conflict ended last month.</p> <p>Apart from visiting the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, shortly after the war ended, Rice - a former Russia scholar - has kept a low profile on the Caucasus crisis in recent weeks, leaving diplomacy to the Europeans and spurning contact with her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.</p> <p>Her speech in Washington was seen as the strongest denunciation yet of the Kremlin.</p> <p>The invasion of Georgia was just one element in growing Russian aggression beyond its borders, she said, citing Moscow's exploitation of its energy resources as a political weapon, threats to target Poland and the Czech republic with nuclear weapons and backing away from international arms control treaties.</p> <p>\"Our strategic goal now is to make it clear to Russia's leaders that their choices are putting Russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The picture emerging from this pattern of behaviour is that of a Russia increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad.\"</p> <p>Moscow's \"primary war aim\" in Georgia had been to overthrow the Saakashvili government, she said, calling it an aim that would not succeed.</p> <p>The failure in Vienna means the EU will play the main international role in Georgia, although OSCE officials said there could be further talks at the UN in New York over the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has agreed with the Kremlin on the dispatch of at least 200 EU monitors, who will be operational by the end of the month, to Georgia. </p> <p>However, the Europeans have accepted Russian terms that they will be concentrated in the Russia-proclaimed \"buffer zone\" outside the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and will not be allowed into the two regions the Russians are garrisoning with almost 8,000 troops.</p> <p>The Sarkozy peace plan has attracted muted criticism from the US and Nato officials for being too lenient on the Russians, but EU officials dismissed the jibes.</p> <p>\"Without the EU, you don't get the Russians out [of Georgia]. There is no alternative. The Americans cannot be part of the solution here,\" an EU official said.</p> <p>The EU mission in Georgia is to be headed by French and German diplomats, while France, Germany, and Italy - all tending towards a pro-Russia stance in the conflict - are putting up most of the personnel, 140 out of 200. Britain is contributing 20 observers.</p>",
  "<p>If 20% of the milk producers in one country are producing poisonous milk, how can consumers trust any others? This is what's happening now in China.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/18/china2\">Sanlu group</a>, one of China's largest baby milk powder manufacturers, revealed last week its products had been contaminated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melamine\">melamine</a>. An industrial chemical used to make plastics and fertilisers, melamine is rich in nitrogen. When added to milk, it can make the milk's protein level appear higher than it actually is. In 2007 the US authorities found that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/06/AR2007050601034.html\">pet food</a> which had caused widespread illnesses was contaminated with the chemical. This time, kidney stones were found in babies who drank the milk provided by Sanlu. By this week, 6,244 babies had fallen ill, while 158 have acute kidney failure. Three babies have died. </p> <p>The Chinese authorities arrested two dairy farmers who supplied Sanlu this week, accusing them of watering down milk and adding melamine to fool quality control checkers testing protein levels. However, the Chinese media reports that Sanlu first received complaints in March that its products were making babies ill. Public complaints to China's general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine (AQSIQ), were made as early as June. Sanlu's New Zealand shareholder Fonterra warned of the risks on August 2, but nothing happened until New Zealand's ambassador contacted senior Chinese officials. This has led some to conclude that the Sanlu Group and local officials tried to cover up the scandal.</p> <p>Sanlu is not an isolated case. A nationwide investigation has found that 22 of the 109 milk producers have batches of products contaminated with the same compound. The Chinese media and public are now pointing the finger at senior officials within AQSIQ, believing they are also in some way responsible.</p> <p>But this is a systemic problem. The dairy farmers added melamine in order to make more money. Manufacturers turned a blind eye during quality control, only caring about pushing down costs. Local officials covered up the scandal, keeping up appearances in order to protect their own careers.</p> <p>There are other cases that demonstrate the interweaving of interests between manufacturers and local officials. Almost at the same time as the Sanlu scandal, a mudslide happened in Shanxi, killing 259 people. Local officials were accused of helping a mining company to cover up the real reason for the mudslide, the collapse of a mining dump belonging to the company. This is not rare phenomenon in China. Manufacturers and local officials collude to cheat the central government and the media. </p> <p>The only victims are the consumers.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that most of the milk powder brands contaminated with melamine are at the lower end of the price range. For example, Sanlu's baby milk powder is priced at 18 yuan (\u00a31.20) per 400g bag (400g). Most are sold in rural areas or less\u2013developed provinces, where income is low and market supervision is lacking. Manufacturers assume the poorer consumers can't afford to care much about food quality, and even if they do, it's easier to silence them because of their lower awareness of consumer rights. The same applies with the Shanxi <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-09/17/content_7032492.htm\">mudslide</a>. Most of those who lost their lives were mineworkers and local farmers. It's really hard for them to seek justice in the local judicial system. So, when accidents happen, a small amount of compensation will keep them silent.</p> <p>One consequence of such criminal acts is that people gradually lose confidence in the manufacturers as well as the local authorities. And this is already happening. Chinese people are now questioning why this country has become so unsafe that even infants can be killed by their only food. When the manufacturers and the local officials don't care about basic ethics, things are bad indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Police have arrested 19 people in connection with a deadly suicide bomb attack on the US embassy in Yemen, authorities said today.</p> <p>Sixteen people were killed when a series of explosions rocked the country's capital, Sana'a, yesterday.</p> <p>A group calling itself Islamic Jihad - unrelated to the Palestinian group of a similar name - claimed responsibility for the attack.</p> <p>It has threatened other embassies including those of Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>The suspects are believed to have links with al-Qaida, which maintains an active presence in the country.</p> <p>Heavy security around the US embassy meant the victims of yesterday's blast were mostly Yemeni troops guarding the perimeter of the site's compound. </p> <p>Non-essential staff were evacuated earlier this year after a less serious incident. </p> <p>Six of the dead were the attackers. One young American woman and her Yemeni husband, who were outside the embassy waiting to complete paperwork, died in the explosions.</p> <p>The attack, involving a double car bombing and machine gun and rocket fire, bore the hallmarks of al-Qaida, whose growing strength in the Arab world's poorest country is alarming western governments and intelligence agencies at a time when the organisation is seen as being on the defensive elsewhere in the Middle East.</p> <p>In a statement to the Agence France-Presse news agency, Islamic Jihad in Yemen said it had carried out the attack, which took place in the middle of the holy month of Ramadan. </p> <p>It also threatened to attack the British embassy and the missions of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates unless an unspecified number of prisoners were freed from Yemeni jails.</p> <p>The US and Britain have helped to train Yemeni security forces.<br>The Saudis, who have all but crushed al-Qaida groups in their country, are concerned about a route for arms, men and money developing across the long desert border with their neighbour, as well as a possible link with lawless Somalia, just across the Red Sea.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Yemeni jihadis are in direct contact with al-Qaida leaders on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but they have identifiable leaders and have recently been producing internet propaganda and focusing on hitting oil infrastructure and foreign interests in the country.</p> <p>The Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Salih, who has been in power since 1978, has been an ally of the US in its \"war on terror\" since the bombing attack on the USS Cole, in Aden harbour in 2000, in which 17 US sailors died. </p> <p>However, his government has been accused of taking a lax approach to extremists, especially after 23 prisoners tunnelled their way out of a Sana'a prison in 2006 amid reports of collusion between officials and militants.</p> <p>Western diplomats say Salih had quiet agreements with al-Qaida that it would be left alone to recruit fighters for the Iraq war if it did not attack inside Yemen. </p> <p>He has pursued a programme under which jihadis are allowed to go free if they promise to mend their ways.</p> <p>\"This attack is a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives,\" the US president, George Bush, said.</p> <p>The US was angered when a Yemeni-American, Jaber Elbaneh, convicted in Yemen of planning attacks, was freed as he appealed against a 10-year prison sentence. </p> <p>Elbaneh was taken back into custody, but Sana'a rejected requests that he be handed over to the US for trial. </p> <p>American officials were alarmed when Yemeni courts commuted a death sentence for Jamal al-Badawi, convicted of masterminding the USS Cole attack. He was given 15 years' jail instead.</p>",
  "<p>In the current financial turmoil, companies are falling like ninepins. Lehman Brothers is in administration. Northern Rock, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been bailed out and the list of <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4412948.ece\">vulnerable banks</a> is growing. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch have been sold at knockdown prices and HBOS has merged with Lloyds TSB. Governments are pouring vast amounts of money to bail out financial institutions. Amidst the mayhem, we need to ask questions about the role of auditors, who have been paid millions of pounds to give opinions on company financial statements. Yet companies are sinking within weeks of getting a clean bill of health.</p> <p>Ever since the 1998 collapse of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management\">Long Term Capital Management</a> (LTCM) and its rescue by the US Federal Reserve, it has been acknowledged that derivatives are very difficult to value. In this case Nobel prize winners in economics could not work out the value of such financial instruments. Derivatives are central to the demise of Lehman. Its annual accounts mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.wallstreet\">derivatives contracts</a> with a face value of $738bn and fair value of $36.8bn.</p> <p>Lehman Brothers, incorporated in the tax haven of Delaware, was audited by the New York office of Ernst &amp; Young. On January 28 2008, the firm gave a clean bill of health to <a href=\"http://www.lehman.com/annual/2007/download/LBAR07.pdf\">Lehman accounts</a> for the year to November 30 2007. The auditor's report (page 75 of the accounts) says, \"Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances\". Lehman Brothers filed <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/806085/000110465908045115/a08-18147_110q.htm\">quarterly accounts</a> with the SEC for the period of May 31 2008 and on July 10 2008 and these (see page 52) too received a clean bill of health. Despite the deepening financial crisis, auditors did not express any reservations about the value of the derivatives or any scenarios under which company may be unable to honour its obligations. Just two months later, Lehman collapsed. </p> <p>During 2007, Ernst &amp; Young collected <a href=\"http://www.lehman.com/shareholder/proxy/2008proxy.pdf\">fees</a> (see page 43) of $31,307,000 from Lehman Brothers, compared to $29,451,000 for 2006. The <a href=\"http://sec.edgar-online.com/2006/02/27/0001047469-06-002510/Section16.asp\">fees for 2005</a> and 2004 were $25,324,000 and $24,748,000 respectively. Over the last four years, Ernst &amp; Young collected over $110m in fees, of which nearly $14m is for advice on tax and other consultancy services.</p> <p>The scale of fees raises questions about auditor independence. By providing other services auditors begin to perform quasi management functions and cannot objectively evaluate the outcome of the transactions they themselves have helped to create. The fee of $110m for the New York office of Ernst &amp; Young is likely to be significant in influencing the financial rewards of local partners and managers. The fee dependency exerts pressure on auditors to acquiesce with management. Such concerns were raised during the demise of WorldCom, Maxwell, Enron and more recently in the insolvency examiner's report on the collapse of <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/Final_Report_New_Century.pdf\">New Century</a>. </p> <p>Audit opinions are akin to financial mirages. In recent weeks, within a short period of receiving clean bills of health <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article3553519.ece\">Bear Stearns</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/16/equities.banking\">Carlyle Capital Corporation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_weil&amp;sid=aZZvWmy4wp3k\">Thornburg Mortgage</a> hit the financial buffers, closely followed by Lehman Brothers. </p> <p>Time and time again it has been shown that the basic audit model is faulty. Private sector auditors cannot be independent of the companies that they audit. This fundamental faultline has not been addressed by the post Enron reforms. In addition, the ex-post financial audits are too late and cannot alert financial regulators of problems. The financial regulators have a wider remit and are also concerned with the financial health of the whole system. These shortcomings were recognised after the 1929 stock market crash. The <a href=\"http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/turner021407.htm\">draft legislation</a> that created the SEC in the 1930s contained a provision making the SEC the auditor for public companies, but under pressure from corporate interests, legislation was diluted. </p> <p>It is time to go back to the future and ensure that audits of major companies, at least banks and financial institutions, are carried out directly by the regulators. These audits should be on a real-time basis. Audits by regulators have the advantage of independence and can address regulatory issues. Accounting firms and companies used to softer audits will no doubt fight tooth-and-nail to retain their privileges, but we can't continue to indulge accounting firms and pay billions to rescue banks.</p>",

  "<p>Lloyds TSB has given the government a pledge that it will keep lending to first-time buyers, in return for assurances that its \u00a312bn bid for HBOS, announced today, would escape the scrutiny of the competition authorities.</p> <p>Sir Victor Blank, the chairman of Lloyds TSB, revealed that he struck the deal with Gordon Brown at a City drinks party on Monday. The prime minister promised that the deal would not be investigated if the enlarged bank continued to provide funds to would-be homeowners. HBOS owns the Halifax and is Britain's biggest mortgage lender. </p> <p>Blank, who is to chair the combined bank following the deal, was speaking after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a> confirmed that it was taking over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbosbusiness\">HBOS </a>in a \"landmark day in financial services history\" that is intended to create one of the strongest banks in the UK but will cause thousands of job losses and branch closures.</p> <p>In an attempt to calm concerns about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">the health of the banking system</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators\">the Financial Services Authority</a> made it clear that it believed the deal would \"enhance finance stability\".</p> <p>In a statement rushed out immediately after the 7am merger news, the FSA said it was \"satisfied that HBOS is a well-capitalised bank that continues to fund its business in a satisfactory way. The announcement of the proposed merger with Lloyds TSB is a welcome move as it is likely to enhance stability within financial markets and improve confidence among customers and investors in the UK financial sector.\"</p> <p>The secretary of state for business, John Hutton, confirmed that the government would override competition law on public interest grounds to \"ensure the stability of the UK financial system\".</p> <p>Blank said it would have \"impossible to contemplate\" launching a takeover bid for HBOS which then would have been subjected to a 12-month competition investigation. The share prices of both companies would likely have fluctuated widely and the deal may have fallen apart.</p> <p>The deal was met with a cautious reception in the City. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a>'s shares fell 8% to 255p on concerns about the future capital strength of the combined bank and the realisation that future dividends may not be as generous. Lloyds intends to pay its final dividend in shares rather than cash to preserve capital.</p> <p>Fitch Ratings placed HBOS's long-term default rating on \"AA\" and Lloyds TSB long-term \"AA+\" rating on \"Rating Watch Negative\". The ratings agency said: \"Fitch considers Lloyds TSB, the smaller party in the merger in terms of consolidated assets, to be a very conservatively managed bank that has been relatively unaffected by the credit crisis.</p> <p>\"While the equity-funded nature of the transaction is supportive of current ratings, the rating watch in respect of Lloyds TSB reflects Fitch's concerns over the potential impact on the group's credit profile of owning lower-rated HBOS. HBOS' existing ratings reflect its high exposure to the deteriorating UK property market and relatively greater reliance on the stressed wholesale funding markets to finance its customer lending. The Rating Watch in respect of Lloyds TSB also reflects the integration risks in undertaking such a substantial transaction at a time of extraordinary financial market turbulence.\"</p> <p>It went on: \"The rating actions in respect of HBOS reflect primarily the execution risk of such a substantial transaction in volatile and unpredictable markets.\"</p> <p>After barely 36 hours of intense negotiations in the wake of a dramatic collapse in the share price of HBOS, the deal was agreed that will see the combined group run by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/hbosbusiness.lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB chief executive, Eric Daniels.</a> </p> <p>Shareholders in HBOS will receive 0.83 Lloyds TSB shares for every one HBOS share, which could to lead wide fluctuations in the value of the deal before it completes early next year. At last night's closing prices, this valued HBOS shares at 232p. Its shares jumped more than 20% to 191p, while Lloyds were 8% lower at 255p. This reduces the value of the bid terms to around 212p.</p> <p>To pay for the deal and preserve capital, Lloyds will need to pay its final dividend in shares rather than cash.</p> <p>In an indication of how hastily the deal had been hatched, there was no specific information on which of the brands would survive from a group that will own names ranging from Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical to Halifax and Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>Nor were there details of board structures, job cuts or branch closures.</p> <p>Despite the move by the government to scrap competition rules to allow the transaction to take place, Daniels insisted the deal was not a \"rescue\" of HBOS and tried to calm fears of 40,000 job losses from the combined workforce of more than 130,000. \"There should not be any impression that that this is a shotgun marriage,\" Daniels said.</p> <p>Daniels said Lloyds and HBOS had been in touch about possible deals since as long ago as 2001 and admitted that in the past competition issues would have prevented the transaction, which he said was now being \"expedited\" by the government.</p> <p>Acknowledging that the group was aiming for \u00a31bn of annual cost savings from 2011, Daniels said that \"ultimately there would be some job losses\". </p> <p>He gave no figures. The combined business will be headquartered on Edinburgh's The Mound, the main base of HBOS, and will focus on increasing demanding for bank deposits, savings and investments.</p> <p>Sir Peter Burt, the former chief executive of Bank of Scotland, which merged with Halifax to form HBOS seven years ago, today said HBOS was a \"victim\" of speculators after a sustained and dramatic fall in shares to as low as 88p yesterday. This deal puts a value of 232p on each Halifax share, well below the 774p at which they floated on the stockmarket in 1997.</p> <p>Andy Hornby, the HBOS chief executive, who is to stay on at the combined bank in an undefined role, acknowledged these has been \"turbulent times\" for the bank.</p> <p>Lord Stevenson, the chairman of HBOS, said: \"This is the right transaction for HBOS and its shareholders. Against the backdrop of the very high levels of volatility our industry is experiencing, the combined group will be one of the strongest players in the UK financial services sector. In addition, the combined group will have excellent brands and a very powerful franchise. We are recommending our shareholders vote for this transaction.\"</p> <p>It was \"a good deal for customers and shareholders,\" Blank said. \"I think we are creating a great British bank.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's leaders today failed to agree on how to divide up the cabinet under a power-sharing agreement that was supposed to end the country's political crisis.</p> <p>\"The meeting was inconclusive, it was a deadlock and has been referred to the negotiating teams for further work to try and find common ground,\" said Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.</p> <p>President Robert Mugabe and the leaders of the two MDC factions - the would-be prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara - left the talks today without agreement. Negotiations are to resume on Saturday.</p> <p>The three men signed up on Tuesday to split a 31-member cabinet between the three parties. Zanu-PF was to have 15 ministries, while the two factions of the MDC would hold 16.</p> <p>Ahead of the meeting, state media quoted Mugabe as describing power-sharing as a humiliation. \"Anyhow, here we are, still in a dominant position which will enable us to gather more strength as we move into the future. We remain in the driving seat,\" he was reported as saying.</p> <p>The deal followed weeks of negotiations to end a political crisis following disputed presidential elections in March, when the MDC won more seats than the ruling Zanu-PF party. Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the presidential vote but the state-appointed electoral commission said he did not have the more than 50% needed to avoid a second round. Tsvangirai boycotted the runoff because of violence against his supporters.</p> <p>Under this week's complex deal, Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980, will retain the presidency, head the cabinet and keep control of the army. The police are expected to fall under the opposition's remit.</p> <p>Western governments have welcomed the deal, brokered by Thabo Mbeki, the South African president, but have said they will wait to see whether a unity government is committed to political and economic reforms before they provide aid for the ruined economy.</p> <p>Once one of Africa's brightest hopes, Zimbabwe is now an economic shambles. Inflation has rocketed to over 11 million per cent and millions have fled to neighbouring countries.</p>",
  "<p>George Bush today defended the US central bank's decision to bail out giant insurer AIG and sought to reassure markets that his administration was intent on confronting the growing crisis.</p> <p>The crisis also shaped the day's talk on the campaign trail, with both candidates seeking to grab the economic situation for their advantage. The economic troubles have shifted the tone of the presidential race, with Barack Obama enjoying a slight resurgence in polling as voters deem him better equipped to manage the ailing economy than Republican John McCain.</p> <p>Under pressure to respond forcefully to the grim economic news, McCain said today that if he were in power he would the nation's top securities regulator and a former Republican congressman, Christopher Cox.</p> <p>\"The chairman of the [Securities and Exchange Commission] serves at the appointment of the president and, in my view, has betrayed the public's trust,\" McCain told supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \"If I were president today, I would fire him.\"</p> <p>Obama, campaigning in Espanola, New Mexico, mocked McCain's threat.</p> <p>\"I think that's all fine and good but here's what I think,\" Obama said. \"In the next 47 days you can fire the whole trickle-down, on-your-own, look-the-other way crowd in Washington who has led us down this disastrous path. Don't just get rid of one guy. Get rid of this administration. Get rid of this philosophy. Get rid of the do-nothing approach to our economic problem and put somebody in there who's going to fight for you.\"</p> <p>Cox, a Bush appointee, attributed McCain's comments to the heat of the campaign. He said the financial crisis was \"presenting new challenges on an hourly basis\" and that \"steadiness and reduction of uncertainty\" is what the US and the world needed.</p> <p>\"History will judge the quality of our response to this economic crisis, but now is not the time for those of us in the trenches to be distracted by the ebb and flow of the current election campaign,\" Cox said in a statement. \"And it is precisely the wrong moment for a change in leadership.\"</p> <p>As stocks in New York rallied in early trading, partly in response to a coordinated series of moves by central banks around the world to pump money into credit markets, Bush said AIG's failure \"could have caused a severe disruption in our financial markets and threatened other sectors of our economy\".</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve seized control of AIG with an $85bn emergency loan in exchange for 80% of the company's stock.</p> <p>Overnight, the US central bank, known as the Fed, joined central banks across the world in coordinated efforts to maintain liquidity in world credit markets, together making almost $200bn available to lenders.</p> <p>\"The markets are adjusting to them,\" Bush said at the White House. \"Our financial markets continue deal with serious challenges. As our recent actions demonstrate, my administration is focused on meeting these challenges. The American people can be assured we will continue to act to strengthen and stabilise our financial markets and to reassure investor confidence.\"</p> <p>Bush said he spoke this morning with the US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, and said the two will meet later today. The president, who had not addressed the nation since Monday, said he had cancelled travel plans in order to monitor the markets and consult with advisers. He was to head to Alabama and Florida to raise money for the Republican party and talk energy policy.</p> <p>The AIG rescue was the fourth taxpayer-funded bailout of the year by the Bush administration, although it is at odds with Bush's free-market ideology and economic policies. Critics of the recent bailouts have said taxpayers should not foot the bill for investors' bad business decisions, and have wondered aloud why AIG and government sponsored mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won massive government rescues while investment bank Lehman Brothers was allowed to crumble on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>Those old computers Americans discard often end up in developing countries, bridging the so-called digital divide - when they work.</p> <p>But there's a dark side to computer exports in which children are threatened by open-air burning of hazardous metals and the \"acid baths\" used to recover bits of gold, a report from the US government accountability office report said yesterday.</p> <p>The report put the blame on the US environmental protection agency, saying the anti-pollution agency has done little to stem illegal exports of old computers and other e-waste by unscrupulous \"recyclers\" to places like China and west Africa.</p> <p>The scathing report by Congress's investigative arm - which the EPA disputes - was initiated after complaints by advocacy groups and a series by the St Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper in 2006 detailing the activities of some e-waste brokers and exporters.</p> <p>Despite evidence of harm, the government report said, the EPA has all but ignored its own 2007 rule clamping down on computer-monitor exports, refusing even to set a timetable to develop an enforcement program.</p> <p>\"To date, the agency has established no enforcement targets, done no monitoring, conducted only preliminary follow-up of suspected violations and taken only one enforcement action\" - five months after the GAO told the agency about the case, the report found.</p> <p>As part of the newspaper series, the Post-Dispatch reported from Nigeria that roughly three-fourths of the thousands of discarded computers arriving monthly in that west African nation are in bad shape or beyond repair, creating messes that pollute the air and land in one of the world's poorest countries. E-waste contains mercury, lead, cadmium and dangerous flame retardants.</p> <p>The series also showed how Americans can become victims at the hands of identity thieves in foreign lands who retrieve social security numbers and other personal information from discarded computers.</p> <p>The GAO report focused primarily on dumping in Asian countries, with its investigators posing as foreign buyers of broken computer terminals. </p> <p>Responding to fictitious e-mails, 43 US companies expressed willingness to export the non-working computers in apparent violation of EPA rules - including companies \"that publicly tout their exemplary environmental practices\", the investigators reported.</p> <p>Unlike European nations, the US allows export of most e-waste, such as computer hard drives, printers and old cell phones. The government has estimated that as much as 80% of electronic garbage collected for recycling ends up in foreign lands.</p> <p>Starting in January of 2007, a new EPA rule applying only to computer monitors which contain about four pounds of lead \u2014 required notification of EPA by exporters and consent of receiving countries.</p> <p>The GAO report noted that since the rule went into effect, Hong Kong officials alone intercepted and returned 26 containers of illegally exported computer monitors but that the EPA had fined just one exporter, a California company.</p> <p>The EPA contested the GAO report, even the title: EPA Needs to Better Control Harmful US Exports Through Stronger Enforcement and More Comprehensive Regulation. </p> <p>In a letter to the GAO, the EPA defended its use of voluntary and \"non-regulatory approaches\" to controlling e-waste exports, arguing that broader rules could take years to take effect.</p> <p>EPA spokesman Tim Lyons added yesterday that his agency had opened 20 investigations in 18 months since the computer-monitor rule went into effect. </p> <p>\"We're certainly committed to improving the compliance and improving the enforcement,\" he said.</p> <p>The report is expected to hasten broader export controls in Congress but perhaps not soon.<br>Noting \"implications for international health problems\", Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, introduced legislation yesterday that would impose an outright ban on e-waste exports.</p> <p>But Representative Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, who heads the House environment subcommittee on hazardous materials and who has proposed similar legislation, told reporters that such efforts this late in Congress amount to \"laying down markers\" and that he doesn't expect serious congressional efforts until 2009.</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street's last standalone investment banks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a>, anxiously tried to reassure staff and clients as their shares collapsed for a second consecutive day, fuelling doubts about their future as independent businesses.</p> <p>Under increasingly urgent pressure to do a deal, Morgan Stanley pursued advanced merger negotiations with the US commercial banking firm Wachovia and held discussions with China's CIC about a possible capital infusion.</p> <p>But Wall Street sources said Morgan Stanley had rebuffed an approach from <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/citigroup\">Citigroup</a> for a tie-up. Such a deal would have involved a great deal of overlap, potentially putting many thousands of jobs at risk.</p> <p>At a hastily arranged \"town hall meeting\" in New York, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, John Mack, tonight told staff that although he would prefer the firm to remain independent, all options were on the table.</p> <p>Amid increasing signs of panic among investors, Morgan Stanley's shares were down 28% by lunchtime in New York and Goldman's stock dived by 14%. Since the beginning of the week, Morgan Stanley's market value has halved, losing $17bn in value, while Goldman's has dropped by 35%, dropping by $21bn.</p> <p>Senior executives at both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs believe the collapse in confidence is nonsensical. They argue that it is driven by short sellers out to make a quick buck. Both banks are profitable and insist that they have nothing like the liabilities held by their erstwhile rivals Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>At Morgan Stanley, insiders said the firm was still prospering, picking up 16 new client mandates in Europe this week of which half were from defunct Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>\"We're dealing with a completely irrational market reaction,\" said a source at one major bank. \"But if you live by the market, you have to accept that markets can occasionally be irrational.\"</p> <p>Founded in 1935, Morgan Stanley employs 48,000 people in 33 countries. Its board of directors includes Howard Davies, the former head of the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley was originally an investment banking breakaway from the commercial banking network JP Morgan. Critics are now questioning whether a Wall Street bank can survive without a high-street network, pushing it into the arms of Wachovia which has 3,300 branches across America.</p> <p>But there was scepticism among analysts about the logic of a deal with Wachovia, which has had its own problems with sub-prime security liabilities at a homeloans company, Golden West Financial, which it bought two years ago.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch's banking analyst, Guy Moszkowski, described the combination as a \"potential mismatch\" which would saddle Morgan Stanley with credit risk: \"It is difficult for us to perceive a strategic benefit for Morgan Stanley, which would be merging with the weakest of the five major US banks.\"</p> <p>China's CIC is Morgan Stanley's biggest shareholder with a stake of 9.9% and another option pursued by Mack was to sell up to 49% to the state-controlled fund - stopping just short of handing the Chinese government control of a major US bank.</p> <p>Although Goldman Sachs was under slightly less pressure than Morgan Stanley, sources said it, too, was opening up channels of communication with sovereign wealth funds. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein offered assurances to staff that Goldman's relatively strong trading performance would see it through.</p> <p>Experts said that a herd mentality was setting in. In a research note, Citigroup's chief US equity strategist, Tobias Levkovich, wrote: \"Fear seems to be overtaking any rational discourse with the credit crunch slipping into crisis proportions and the desire to be in cash overwhelming any willingness to remain invested in equities.\"</p> <p>The index of market volatility, known as VIX, reached its highest level since 2002. Levkovich said that after a 25% fall from their peak, stocks are down by more than the average slump for an entire recession.</p> <p>Several US money market funds, usually seen as ultra-safe, shut down after struggling with Lehman Brothers debt which had been viewed as low risk until this week.</p> <p>An auction began for the troubled Seattle-based bank Washington Mutual, which has 2,200 branches across the US. It has called in Goldman Sachs to find a buyer. There has been speculation that Britain's HSBC could be interested. Others mentioned include JP Morgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be twiddling his thumbs here from 7.50pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>Oh hi, thanks for coming. Sit yourself down and prepare to be amused by Tottenham's latest attempt to out-farce Newcastle and West Ham. Luka Modric, Roman Pavlyuchneko and Vedran Corluka can't join us unfortunately, and Michael Dawson and Tom Huddlestone have been dropped like faulty bombs, but wonky crosser Aaron Lennon will still be on hand to entertain, as will Tottenham's always hilarious defence. So hold your sides, readers \u2026 </p> <p>Wisla Krakow, since you ask, have won six of the last ten Polish titles and were knocked out of the Champions League last month despite beating Barcelona 1-0 at home (after sinking 4-0 away). </p> <p><strong>The bit where we begin a campaign to re-appropriate the definition of wags</strong><br>\"Are Spurs the lowest ranked team in this tournament?\" dribbles Ray Rayburn, who's so convinced I'm a dullard that he feels the need to elaborate. :What I mean is, are any of the other 47,327 clubs in this round currently sitting dead last in their league with only a point to show for four games?\" I don't know, Rob _ I intended checking but didn't get further than the Finnish team who are taking on Racing Santander \u2013 truly, FC Honka is one of football's great team names. The fact that they're from a city called Espoo makes me like them even more. </p> <p>Anyone know any better team names (real teams, that is, not Fantasy Football ones)? My favourites includes Dutch low-fliers Go Ahead Eagles, Bolivia's The Strongest (who in 1930 lived up to their name by winning the league without conceding a single goal!), Swazi chancers Eleven Men in Flight and Ghanaian duo Cape Coast Venomous Vipers and Cape Coat Mysterious Dwarfs. </p> <p><strong>Teams: </strong><br><strong>Spurs:</strong> Gomes, Gunter, Woodgate, King, Bale, Bentley, Jenas, Zokora, Lennon, Giovani, Bent. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cesar, Huddlestone, Gilberto, Campbell, Dawson, O'Hara, Assou-Ekotto.</p> <p><strong>Not Spurs</strong>: Pawelek, Singlar, Baszczynski, Cleber, Diaz, Boguski, Sobolewski, Cantoro, Zienczuk, Pawel Brozek, Jirsak.<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Juszczyk, Guedes Filho, Glowacki, Niedzielan, Malecki, Lobodzinski, Barreto.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Lucilio Cardoso Cortez Batista (Portugal, where people aren't too lazy to give their kids as many names as seems right)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>8pm</strong> Wisla have over 3,000 fans in the ground tonight and they're creating a superb atmosphere despite the empty seats in the Spurs section. Pole dancing always puts people in a good mood ...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>8:05pm:</strong> My inbox remains sadly unmolested ... fortunately the teams have just taken to the pitch, giving me something to say. Such as \"the teams have just taken to the pitch\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>8:08pm:</strong> Speaking of splendid atmospheres, get a load of this: \"When living in Ghana in 2000 I once went to see the Mysterious Dwarves play Accra Hearts of Oak,\" recalls Hugh Rees. \"It as brilliant fun.\" Oh, well that's good.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We have kick-off.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Chaos in the Polish box already after the keeper fumbled a Bentley cross from the right. His defenders managed to scramble it to safety, however.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> After the frantic opening, Krakow has successfully calmed thigns down, stroking the ball around aimlessly but effectively.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Lennon, on whom, in a moment of madness, I put money to score tonight, shanks a cross into the stands. As usual. \"I was going to suggest The Strongest, so I'm glad you had them in your original list of great team names,\" blurts David Mooney. \"Then there's Joe Public, who are<br>Trinidad and Tobago's representatives in the CONCACAF Champions League.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Krakow are starting to look dangerous now. There's a cohesion to them that Spurs sorely lack. Sobolewski in midfield is bursting forward ominously, and jsut went close with a shot from 20 yards. \"Am sitting on a crowded train to Wimbledon after work, refreshing your minute by minute report on my painfully slow Blackberry,\" weeps Richard Simkins. \"I can't help thinking that as a Spurs fan this will be about as exciting as my season gets.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> As news filters through that Everton have fallen a goal down at home to Standard Liege, Spurs win a corner. Bentley's delivery is flicked on at the near post by King ... and flashes well wide on the other side. \"Botswana Meat Commission FC was always my favourite team name,\" rejoices Apur Patel.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Wisla are comfortable, Spurs failing to apply any sort of sustained pressure. \"Hi Kevin, Finnish side FC Honka do indeed come from the city of Espoo - its relation to Helsinki being in every sense like Luton's to London. But sadly it's not pronounced s-poo but s-paw,\" lectures Elliot, who seems to think he's writing to Reading's top scorer.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>16 min: </strong> Nothing much doing on the pitch as Spurs lack shape and inspiration. Their fans are decidedly quiet, only the merry chanting of Wisla's army is keeping them awake. \"I took my nephew to see Spurs' limp performance on Monday night as a treat for getting 11 As at GCSE,\" brags Daniel Bernstein. \"Next time he does well at exams I'll take him to a museum - at least the atmosphere will be better!\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> At least some cohesion from Tottenham - Gunter raided forward to exchange passes with Jenas and then fire a ball towards Bent, who was just beaten to it by his marker. Yes, that's pretty much as good as it's good for Spurs so far.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Tasty work by Bale down the left, but his low cross is slashed away at the near post by another valiant defender. \"Your inbox remains unmolested?\" kisses Sarah Lawton. \"I bet the Spurs defence would love to be able to say the same.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Pawelek punches a Bentley corner almost as far as the half-way line! That should dissuade any Spur from challenging him for the ball tonight ...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Bentley curls in another corner and Woodgate rises well to meet it, but he heads the ball straight into the ground, and by the time it bounces back up the keeper has adjusted his position and gathers it easily. \"Teams from the various top level Oceanian leagues have some of the best names,\" roars Harry Shave, who has a pretty fine name himself. \"Cook Island's Sokattack Nikao, American Samoa's Flame On, Wild Bills of the Northern Marianas' top league, the Solomon Islander's Lagoon Brothers FC. When the credit crunch hits properly and Setanta have to sell their fixture's package to ESPN to stay afloat, maybe we'll see them buy the rights to broadcast this high level football. They'd be better than Spurs.\" Flame On! That definitely makes the three names in the world. Thanks for alerting me to their existence , Harry.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Wisla launch a long ball into the Tottenham box and it breaks to Boguski, whose piledriver is well bocked by King.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Without truly clicking into gear yet, Spurs have certainly found a degree of slickness and are regularly threatening down the wings \u2026 now if only they could cross accurately they might actually create some genuine chances. But whenever Wisla venture forward, Spurs's trademark defensive brittleness is still there. \"You suggest that Spurs are in a farce mini-league with Newcastle and West Ham,\" guffs Steve Mitchell. \"How come Man City have dropped out of this prestigious competition? I would have thought that the Arabian millions would have offered the possibility of hitherto unimagined Man City farcical hilarity.\" It's fair point, Steve, and something for us all to look forward to.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Gunter lofts a long ball forward and Cleber completely misses his kick, allowing Bent to scamper after it \u2026 but Pawelek sprints out of his box to hoof it clear. And for his troubles cops a face-full of Bent, who collided with him while attempting to get there first.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spurs 1-0 Wisla (Bentley 33')</strong></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Giovani rolled the ball out left to Lennon, who scurried into the box before cutting it back - accurately! - to Bentley, who was left with the simple task of slotting it into the empty net.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spurs 1-1 Wisla 1 (Jirsak 34')</strong></p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Did someone say farce? 67 seconds after taking the lead (for the first time this season), Spurs perform their traditional defensive implosion, allowing Boguski to saunter into the box down the right and pick out a team-mate in the centre. With some Spurs calling for a non-existent offside and others spinning dizzily, Jirsak slammed the ball past Gomes and into the net!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> See that photo above? That's <em>exactly</em> how Ramos looks right now. Except much, much more angry.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> A decent response from Spurs, in fairness. Bale clipped a lovely ball to the back stick from the left. Wisla cleared as far as Bent, who from an acute angle rocketed it into the side-netting.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>40 min: </strong>Bentley wafts a 25-yard free-kick over the bar. \"Why aren't the dangerous three with us: Modirc , Pavlyuchenko and <br>Corluka,\" blubs Stig Anderson. \"Are they cup tied or have been dropped due to being 'out of focus'?\" The Russians's cup-tied and the other two are injured.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Oooh! Spurs nearly concede another! They really are shambolic at the back, a fact that's being aggravataed by the central midfielders unwillingness/inability to track runners from deep, one of whom (Brozek) turned up at the edge of the box to poke a shot towards the top corner. Gomes did well to tip it behind.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Bentley danced past two defenders and reached the by-line, where he sized up his options and then - you've guessed it - whacked the ball into the dancing Polish throngs.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> A swerving Beckhamesque cross by Bale is butted clear by Baszcczynski. And with that, the ref blows for half-time. And with <em>that</em>, Jeff Kavanagh quips: \"Tottenham Hotspur is looking a pretty decent nomination for the most comical name for a football team.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> The toilet awaits. For me, and possibly Tottenham's Uefa Cup hopes too.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Out trot Tottenham for the second half and, encouragingly, none of them fell over in comical fashion. Ramos has resisted the temptation to make changes, possibly because the transfer window's closed. In other news, I can't quite believe that I forgot the best team name in the world. Fortunately Stephen Peake is here to reveal it: \"It's surely South Africa's Dangerous Darkies,\" he trumpets correctly. We should note that South Africa is also home, of course, to the Black Leopards, Black Bees, Ukhamba Black Aces, the Giant Aces, Publican Brothers, Mighty FC, Mother City FC and, er, Leeds United.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>49 min: </strong>As Led Zeppelin put it, the song remains the same. No change in personnel and no change in Tottenham's performance so far. Giovani should be removed for he has been plod, and so should Lennon for making me look like an idiot for backing him to score. \"Richard Simkins (7 min.) surely doesn't have to worry that reading the MBM on a dodgy Blackberry is going to be the most exciting part of the season as a Spurs fan,\" chortles Gordon Burns. \"What could be more exciting than a nail-biting drive to avoid relegation?\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> A shoddy pass by Junior Diaz gifts Bentley the chance to have a crack from 25 yards, and Pawelek touches it over the bar for a corner, which is wasted.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Spurs actually open Wisla up thanks to a tidy pass from Jenas but Giovani, betraying his lack of confidence, spurned a clear shooting opportunity from eight yards and instead tried to feed Bent instead. His pass was misdirected and the chance is lost.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Spurs substitution - Frazier Campbell comes on for Lennon to make his debut. Jamie O'Hara also replaces Gunter. Amazing that Giovani is being allowed to continue.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Neat build-up play by Wisla culminates with a stinging low shot from distance by Zienczuk. Gomes held it well.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min: </strong>Tottenham think they've scored a good goal - and they have! But the linesman puts up his flag anyway, ruling out Bent effort after another astute pass from Jenas. As the saying goes, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to laugh ...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> With Spurs piling men into the box Bentley goes and serves up a cross so bad it wouldn't even scare Dracula.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Campbell is looking sprightly since his introduction, and darn near created a goal just there, chipping a dainty cross towards bent. But a heroic Polish defender got his head in the way.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Zokora is now playing at right-back. Elsewhere I see that Bellinzona have been beaten 3-4 at home by Galatasaray, their pain being intensified by the fact that that Milan Baros and ... Harry Kewell both managed to score against them!</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Sobalewski saunters through the middle and has a whack form 20 yards. It flew just wide but Ramos will be peeved at how easy it was for the Pole to splice his midfield.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>68 min: </strong> Zokora surges down the right and smashes a dangerous cross towards the near post, but Wisla continue to defend well. Another result of note tonight - Schteve McClaren's FC Twente were - would you believe? - beaten. 2-1 in Rennes, as if you needed to be told.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Bent barges towards the box and unleashes a shot that takes a deflection before fizzing behind. Before the corner can be taken, Spurs make their final substitution, Giovani finally coming off, to be replaced by Assou-Ekotto, who'll presumably go to left-back so that Bale can push forward.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Bentley wastes the corner. Again.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> bad, but somewhat predictable news for Spurs: Ledley King appears to be limping. Which means he is limping, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>75 min: </strong>Wisla change - Malecki replaces Boguski.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spurs 2-1 Wisla (Bent 75')</strong></p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Campbell has made the difference! He collected a long ball from the back with a beautiful first touch, beat his man and chipped a dinky ball across to Bent, who leaped above Cleber to nod it into the net from seven yards. Expect a Wisla equaliser any second now ...</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> After Woodgate heads a Wisla free-kick clear, Tottenham break rapidly. Bale has Bent lurking in the box but prefers to have a bash himself, and his low shot from the left is diverted out for a corner. Which is wasted, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Wisla are lumping balls into the box but King and Woodgate have dealt with them handily so far. \"Earlier I had resolved to keep drinking wine until Spurs scored,\" reveals Sandra Forte. \"But now that they've finally done it I'm too slaughtered to stop!\" I hope you're not expecting sympathy, Sandra? All I've got here is a cardboard cup of cold coffee. Boo and, indeed, hoo.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Though 2-1 away is far from a poor result for Wisla, they're showing plenty of ambition to equalise and their nimble interplay is starting to trouble Spurs again. Meanwhile, the moral of the story so far, accordingto Seth Levine, is the following: \"What does that second goal say about Levy's obsession with the 'continental' system? The only decent performance of the season comes from the loan player foisted upon Spurs as a make-weight for Berbatov, whilst Commoli's signings continue to struggle. Kind of like Caf\u00e9 Rouge - you can imitate what works on the continent, but you can't replicate it.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> A lull. Wisla's aforementioned ambition didn't last long, and Spurs can't muster much more either.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> After King fluffed an attempted interception, Niedzielan was presented with the chance to race through on goal from the half-way line. Woodgate sprinted after him and slid in to dispossess him jsut as he was about to shoot form the edge of the box.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Jenas twists into the box and then generously returns the ball for Wisla. Apparently he was trying to tee up Bale, who was a good 10 yards away.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> O'Hara is booked for time-wasting. Oh yes, the glory, glory nights are back at White Hart Lane.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Full-time</strong> That's your lot. But do come back for the second leg, because this tie is far from over. Likewise Tottenham are still far from coherent despite this victory. Frazier Campbell, however, showed enough to suggest he just might be their best signing of the summer. Bye, and thanks</p>",
  "<p>The public finances suffered yet another lurch into the red last month amid warnings of a record deficit this year that would force the next government to raise taxes or cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/taxandspending\">spending</a>, or both.</p> <p>There was an overall shortfall of tax revenues relative to spending of \u00a310.2bn in August - the worst August figure since monthly records began in 1993. Economists said the speed of the deterioration, if continued, could push the deficit to \u00a370bn this fiscal year, double the 2007/08 figure and way above the \u00a343bn estimate the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, made in the budget in March.</p> <p>A deficit of \u00a370bn would easily exceed the previous record of \u00a351bn set by the Conservative government of John Major in 1993.</p> <p>For the April to August period, the deficit was running \u00a312bn worse than in the same period last year at a deficit of \u00a328bn. And the national debt figures lurched higher as the government's nationalisation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a>'s \u00a387bn of debt came on to the books for the first time, pushing debt up to 43.3% of national income, well above the government's self-imposed 40% ceiling.</p> <p>Excluding Northern Rock, the benchmark stood at 38.3%, although the Treasury is currently reviewing its two main fiscal rules as both are likely to be broken.</p> <p>The government's problem is set to be exacerbated by the downturn in the economy. Figures out on Wednesday showed the biggest rise in unemployment for 16 years in August, which will push down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/incometax\">income tax</a> receipts and increase benefit payments to the unemployed, pushing the deficit out still further.</p> <p>The government's \u00a32.7bn cost of unwinding the 10p tax debacle, the postponement of fuel duty rises and the temporary scrapping of the starting rate of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">stamp duty</a> for house purchases will all push up the deficit, as will the housing market collapse.</p> <p>This week's 4,500 job losses at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>, combined with other City job losses, are particularly bad news for the public finances because bankers are highly paid and therefore pay a lot of income tax, analysts pointed out.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics, said: \"The state of the public finances continues to go from dreadful to even worse. If this rate of increase is sustained, borrowing will hit \u00a370bn this year.\"</p> <p>The figures show the government is struggling to bring spending growth under control at a time when tax revenues are weakening. </p> <p>\"If recent trends are sustained, borrowing would reach \u00a364bn for the year as a whole. And with the economic outlook likely to worsen over the coming months there is a good chance that the outturn could be even worse,\" said Andrew Goodwin, an economist at the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club. </p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said the chancellor's predictions had been \"well and truly blown out of the water\".</p> <p>The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, said: \"Gordon Brown has built our economy on a mountain of public and private debt, leaving Britain poorly prepared in the face of the current economic crisis. His fiscal rules are now totally discredited. This is yet more evidence of why we need a new fiscal framework to bring the public finances back under control - and a new government to implement it.\"</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Faced with unprecedented world shocks, it is right that we increase <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/governmentborrowing\">borrowing</a> this year to help support the economy. We are cutting taxes by over \u00a34bn for low and middle income families, and maintaining public sector investment to help families and the economy through these tougher times.\"</p>",
  "<p>Some time after dinner this evening, <strong><a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo</a></strong> will switch on the first incarnation of its new and slightly personalisable homepage design.

Yahoo pulls in 35 million unique users on its homepage each month in Europe alone, it claims, and 300 million worldwide. So this is no small undertaking - and the first redesign since 1996.</p> <p>Senior vice-president of front doors and network services <strong>Tapan Bhat</strong> explained the thinking for the new site; to help people sort the huge volume of information online, bring in the \"best of breed\" niche sites that they already use, and to deal with information in a time-efficient way. The key to that, he said, is relevance. And that means a personalisable homepage, or what Yahoo describes as \"a personally relevant starting point\".</p> <p><strong>The new design</strong></p> <p>The new design is a three-column split: application on the left, news in the large centre column and ads and links on the right.</p> <p>There are two big trends here. The first is the application box on the left which, expanding from the sidebar, lets users add modules from their favourite social networking sites. Bhat was a little unclear about which services would be added and when but the prototype panel I saw included the usual suspects: <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>MySpace</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> et al. Bhat said Yahoo recognised that this kind of feature (which has more than a few echoes of FreindFeed-style aggregation) needs to be as simple as possible. Aggregation is well enough, but can we all be bothered to set up multiple versions of multiple services in multiple places? And if this is Yahoo as an application platform, will they, at some point, open up to external developers through <strong>Open Social</strong>?</p> <p>Part of the applications column is email though, which includes AOL mail and even Google Mail as well as Yahoo. The range of applications will be gradually expanded.</p> <p><strong>The news bit</strong></p> <p>Next - the middle column. Yahoo has done UK deals with the <strong>Guardian</strong>, <strong>Telegraph</strong> and the <strong>Sun</strong>, initially to feature their comment under branded tabs on the news box here. In France, Yahoo has worked with <strong>Le Monde</strong>, <strong>Lib\u00e9ration</strong> and <strong>Le Figaro</strong>. Above that, individual stories are pulled out by headline with about four featured at any one time. Bhat said these will become more personalised the more you used the site; this is using Yahoo's Content Optimisation Knowledge Engine which asses things like your search and browsing history.</p> <p><strong>Janine Shaw</strong>, director for Front Page and My Yahoo at Yahoo! Europe, said a period of focus and research groups had confirmed that news content is one of the strongest drivers of traffic to the Yahoo site, but that people want new from a variety of sources.</p> <p>\"Yahoo has a significant reach into the UK population and the benefit for publishers is in driving traffic to their site,\" she said. \"The benefit for users is that they can get content form a variety of sources an we're looking at a variety of different ways of increasing that appeal to users.\"</p> <p>She wouldn't say any more on that, but it very much sounds like there are plans to introduce more heavily promoted an possibly paid-for features for news publishers to reach this audience. One to watch.</p> <p>That third column has access to the rest of Yahoo's services, plus a more prominent ad box, also tied to the relevancy algorithms.</p> <p><strong>Automated personalisation</strong></p> <p>One of the keys here, and no small point, is that Yahoo has recognised that personalisation needs to be automated. We just can't bothered to spend time, even five minutes, customising our home pages or adding our feeds. Only 15% of Yahoo's userbase have bothered to set up a My Yahoo account, which offers a highly customisable homepage.</p> <p>So from tonight, this will be available to one million randomly chosen users in the US, UK, India and France. Why that strategy for roll out? People are resistant to change, \" said Bhat. \"There are people who love change but most don't like to try new things. Yahoo is a mainstream site so we need to make sure that whatever sites we're working on will work for mainstream users.\"</p> <p>You could try clicking refresh all night, and try your luck?</p>",
  "<p>I may be the last person on earth to have discovered this, but I was completely unaware that Bruce Dickinson, the singer of Iron Maiden, was a commercial airline pilot. I know several musicians who fly (producer <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ron+St.+Germain\">Ron St Germain</a> flies his own plane to almost all of his out-of-town production gigs), but Bruce Dickinson is the only one who flies commercially as a parallel career. When quizzed about it he said: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/oct/15/theairlineindustry.g2\">Put it this way: I'm not quite sure whether I want to be wandering around in spandex at 60</a>\". </p> <p>Many musicians are not as forward-thinking as Dickinson, and are forced to change careers for financial reasons. The music industry is youth-oriented and fickle, and for musicians there is no safety net. When compiling their CV, they may find that qualifications gained as an artist may not count for much in most other professions. Hence, many end up working behind the scenes in the same business. </p> <p>Most songwriters I know started out as artists. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/max%20martin\">Max Martin</a>, who's had hits with almost every pop mega-star in the past decade (his latest one being Katy Perry's No 1, single I Kissed a Girl), started out as a singer in Swedish metal band It's Alive.</p> <p>Feargal Sharkey put his experience as the singer of the Undertones to good use by <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/bmr_feargal_sharkey/\">campaigning for other artists</a>, once he put his music career on the backburner. He's now chief executive of British Music Rights and even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jun/17/illegaldownloadsthesolution\">writes for theguardian.com</a>.</p> <p>Craig Logan - the guy in Bros who wasn't related to the others - left the band after their first album. Even back then he showed business savvy by suing the band for unpaid royalties and gaining himself $1m, leaving the Goss brothers in debt. That came in handy when he became the manager of Pink and <a href=\"http://www.sonybmgmusic.co.uk/company_news/5248/\">managing director of RCA Records</a>.</p> <p>Unlike Bruce Dickinson, many artists move into other areas just to make some extra pocket money on the side - and, possibly, out of boredom. Roger Daltrey owns a trout fishery, which is slightly less rock'n'roll than flying jet planes. Others like Britney, P Diddy, Bill Wyman and BB King have opened restaurants. </p> <p>Becoming a children's author seems like a natural progression to numerous artists. Madonna, Paul McCartney, Gloria Estefan - they've all had a crack at it. Louise Wener, the singer of 90s act Sleeper, has gone beyond dabbling and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/news/louisewener_300702.shtml\">restyled herself as a full-fledged novelist</a>. </p> <p>Wener, like the majority of former recording artists, wouldn't have been able to survive on royalties for long, after her group disbanded. So, what happened to other stars of the 80s, 90s - hell, even the ones from a few years ago? What do you do if you don't want to go on Celebrity Big Brother in an attempt to reboot your career?</p> <p>Well, Freedom Williams (remember him? He was the rapper on C+C Music Factory's Things That Make You Go Hmmmm...) is, according to Wikipedia, the majority owner of the Continental Basketball Association's Atlanta Krunk franchise. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/mar/11/behindthemusichowduffysav\">In a previous blogpost I mentioned</a> how a songwriter I know got into a mini-cab only to realise that the driver had been in a band - signed to a major label - with him, years earlier. And <a href=\"http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,869259,00.html\">Peter Green</a>, former guitarist with Fleetwood Mac, ended up working as a gravedigger for a while. </p> <p>It always makes me feel uneasy when X Factor contestants say they expect to have a lifelong career in music (or, as they put it, \"conquer the world\"). They could learn a valuable lesson from Bruce Dickinson, who has obviously not been completely seduced by the trappings of rock stardom. He's decided to take control of his own destiny - and flying jet planes must be the closest to rock'n'roll you can get without picking up an instrument.</p>",
  "<p>First there were faint scratchings and then some serious, badass clawing at the door. At least, it sounded like the door \u2013 the kitchen sink unit cupboard door \u2013 so that was what I kicked to make the evil creature go away. Too scared to open it, I swore a lot instead: \"Shit, what a big bastard that must be.\" Such is the effect that rats can have. They turn socialised urban humans into inflamed yet cowering beasts. And when I spotted a damaged baby of the species crawling unsteadily across the floor my horror was complete. Fortunately, my six year-old was with me. \"Oh look, Daddy!\" she cried. \"A baby mouse!\"</p> <p>Not a mouse, actually, sweetheart. I soon learned, though, that my younger kids are not yet immersed in the dark lore of the rat, whose ability to unnerve adult homosapiens is rivalled only by crocodiles, hyenas and wasps. Soon my daughter and her brother, aged 10 (formerly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/29/thegreatnessofeightness\">eight</a>) had provided the ailing infant with a piece of cheese, some soft bedding and a home in the vogue-ish form of a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-Microwave-Plate-Cover/dp/B00004W4UQ\">microwave plate cover</a>. There was a moulded plastic anteater for company. \"Wash your hands properly,\" I said edgily as the children prepared for sleep. They'd been warned that our guest would be ejected before dawn. \"It needs to find its mummy,\" I explained, glancing fearfully at the sink unit once more.</p> <p>Talk about spooked. Only days earlier I'd <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2008/sep/10/blogpost\">blogged</a> about <a href=\"http://transpont.blogspot.com/2008/09/rats-london-and-folklore.html\">a talk to be given</a> by the South-East London Folklore Society on the subject of rats, how they have been \"used to represent the Other\" and what we Londoners' view of them might reveal of our relationships with our city. The coincidence seemed forbidding. Had I brought this rodent colonisation on myself merely by pondering the subject? Were sinister forces \u2013 or maybe just the internet \u2013 at work in the metropolitan sewers? </p> <p>Such reveries may be far-fetched, but I doubt I'm alone in my susceptibility to them. Reports over <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2164999.stm\">several years</a> of massive increases in Britain's rat population have generated in London the common saying, \"You're never more than a few feet from a rat\". The proliferation of compost bins and bird feeders, neglect of sewage pipes, reductions in local Councils providing pest control for free and, of course, junk food being discarded in the streets are the main culprits. It took a massive fire to end the <a href=\"http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/GreatPlague.htm\">last public health disaster</a> caused in London by rats, in which tens of thousands died. Perhaps there would be more public alarm now were it not that London rats today mostly dwell beneath our feet, meaning that most citizens <a href=\"http://www.derelictlondon.com/rats_and_pigeons.htm\">don't ever see them</a>. If the National Rodent Survey (available via <a href=\"http://www.npta.org.uk/\">here</a>) is any guide, that may soon change. It's already changed for me.</p> <p>As I type, the builder who installed my new kitchen last year is hard at work repelling the invaders. Confident that the problem began with an unsealed junction between waste pipe and drain, he's filling the gap with concrete. There is a grim resolve about his labours, stirred by a close encounter with the monster behind the cupboard door. In fact, it wasn't in the actual cupboard but the low space beneath it, created by the wooden plinth it stands on. The builder removed the plinth's front panel and made brief eye contact with the feral inhabitant before it scurried, reluctantly, back down the drain. \"Big motherfucker,\" he exclaimed, likening its length to the distance between his fingertips and wrist. \"Huge evil bastard.\"</p> <p>We've peered around in the basement, our trouser bottoms tucked into our socks. Finding no signs of infestation, we're confident that the baby rat squeezed out through a narrow gap at the back of the plinth (which might explain its disabled state) and that fixing the drain will fix the whole problem. The concrete takes three hours to dry. The builder has set a trap beside it, just in case. But I am not complacent. This morning, just before dawn, I saw a fox defecating in the middle of my garden. The expression \"urban jungle\" may soon cease to be a metaphor. The city has dropped its defences. The wild is closing in.</p>",
  "<p>The possibility that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/18/tzipi.livni.kadima.election\">Tzipi Livni</a> will become Israel's next prime minister has re-ignited hopes of a breakthrough in the peace process, but chances are we are probably in for yet another false dawn.</p> <p>Since the 1990s, efforts to reach a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been going round and round in vicious circles, while the situation on the ground has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/aweekingaza\">deteriorating</a> constantly.</p> <p>There is no shortage of thorny practical issues \u2013 from the question of Palestinian refugees to final borders \u2013 standing in the way of a deal, not to mention the power disparity between the two sides, but what role does rigid religious or pseudo-religious ideology play in perpetuating the struggle?</p> <p>To get an idea, we need to rewind to the most hopeful period of the Oslo years. Finally at ease in his role as a dove, Yitzhak Rabin, the one-time hawk, soared on the wings of the biggest mass demonstration in Israeli history. \"This rally must send a message to the Israeli public, to the Jews of the world, to the multitudes in the Arab lands and in the world at large,\" he urged the 150,000-strong crowd that had turned out to hear him speak in Tel Aviv, \"that the nation of Israel wants peace\".</p> <p>The message was apparently all too clear to the hawks that had been circling around him ever since he had decided to talk directly to his former arch-enemies, Yasser Arafat and the PLO. On that autumn night, November 4, 1995, Rabin paid for his \"betrayal\" with his life. His <a href=\"http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3463405,00.html\">assassination</a> sent shockwaves across the country, the region and the world, with that rare spectacle of Arabs expressing grief for a slain Israeli politician.</p> <p>The killer was Yigal Amir, a university student who was a far-right religious Zionist. After his arrest, he told police he had acted on \"the orders of God\". Reflecting the distrust and hate elicited among the settler movement, Amir confessed to a later commission of inquiry: \"I felt as if I was shooting a terrorist.\" </p> <p>Although religious and revisionist Zionists quickly distanced themselves from the murder, many Israelis are convinced that, even if Amir pulled the trigger, the extremists provided him with the ideological ammo. The settler movement had accused Rabin of planning to withdraw to \"Auschwitz borders\" and Orthodox rabbis had called on soldiers to disobey any orders to evacuate any part of the West Bank.</p> <p>Rabin's grieving widow, Leah, refused to shake hands with the Likud's Binyamin Netanyahu, one of the staunchest and most vitriolic opponents of Rabin's peace overtures, but shook Arafat's hand. \"I feel that we can find a common language with the Arabs more easily than we can with the Jewish extremists,\" she said.</p> <p>The Likud and other revisionist Zionists, the right-wing religious parties and the settler movement oppose the peace process because they advocate the annexation and settlement of the whole of Eretz Israel (Land of Israel), the vaguely-defined Biblical territory which God \"promised\" to Abraham. \"Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel,\" reads the <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm\">Likud party's platform</a>.</p> <p>Even the ostensibly more pragmatic religious party, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shas\">Shas</a>, which is vaguely in favour of making some concessions to the Palestinians, advocates the \"Greater Israel\" enterprise. Despite his \"fatwa\" that the sanctity of human lives is more important than that of the land, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's spiritual leader, instructed his men to leave Rabin's government in protest against the Oslo accords and, again in July 2000, the rabbi withdrew Shas from Ehud Barak's government to undermine the Camp David summit.</p> <p>But it is not just extremist Israelis who believe they own a divine deed to the land, Palestinian Islamists, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad possess the inverse view. According to Hamas's <a href=\"http://www.palestinecenter.org/cpap/documents/charter.html\">1988 charter</a>, \"Palestine has been an Islamic Waqf (endowment) throughout the generations and until the Day of Resurrection, no one can renounce it or part of it, or abandon it or part of it.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly then, Hamas \u2013 created during the first intifada as a reaction to the increasingly oppressive Israeli occupation and the increasing willingness of Palestinian secularists to reach an accommodation with Israel \u2013 was incensed by Oslo and started a suicide bombing campaign to undermine the process. This, coupled with the death toll and humiliation inflicted by the Israeli military on the Palestinian population, sought to chip away at public confidence in the peace process on both sides and to restore mutual distrust.</p> <p>An Arabic proverb talks of people who kill and then lead the funeral procession. And that is what the extremists seem to be on the verge of doing with the two-state solution. On the Israeli side, Rabin's murder marked the beginning of the end for the moderates and pragmatists. A shaken Shimon Peres was unable to regain momentum and shot himself in the foot with his Grapes of Wrath invasion of Lebanon, and the election of Binyamin Netanyahu sounded the final death knell for the Oslo process.</p> <p>On the Palestinian side, the continued failure of the Palestinian Authority to deliver an independent state, as well as its endemic corruption, strengthened the hand of the extremists, propelling Hamas to a series of local election victories, crowned by their success in the 2006 parliamentary elections.</p> <p>Israeli and Palestinian extremists achieved this by having the unshakable drive and conviction \u2013 one could say \"delusion\" --\u2013 to take advantage of the fractured political landscape, by preying on the fear and distrust of the enemy, and by hoodwinking the electorate. For instance, Hamas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/12/israel\">dropped the call</a> for the destruction of Israel from its election manifesto prior to the 2006 election, while Netanyahu promised to respect the peace process and deliver \"peace with security\".</p> <p>What the extremists have been unable to answer is what to do with the elephant in the room: the millions from the \"enemy camp\"? How do they achieve their fantasies of territorial maximalism without having to oppress an entire people permanently, which is impossible?</p> <p>Neither Jewish nor Palestinian extremists are likely to abandon their ultimate dreams easily, but there are signs that they can be pushed to become more practical and pragmatic. Ariel Sharon, the die-hard warhorse, broke away from the Likud he founded to take a somewhat more pragmatic path with his new Kadima party. The responsibilities of office have shown that Hamas can be more accommodating than its past suggests, with the Islamist party indicating its willingness to end its armed struggle with Israel in return for a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 borders. Unfortunately, the Israelis and international community have failed to engage with Hamas.</p> <p>Despite the best efforts of the extremists, the Israeli and Palestinian public still crave peace, as poll after poll confirms, but agreeing a fair price for it is the challenge. The Oslo process had many faults: its fixation on Israel's short-term security and its vagueness on the shape and form of a Palestinian state; accelerated settlement building, as well as the deferral of all the thorny issues to the final status talks. However, given the current hopeless mess, one cannot help feel a window of opportunity closed with Rabin's assassination.</p> <p>Had Rabin lived, the final status talks which were due to start on May 4, 1996, may have led somewhere, rather becoming an empty shell. After all, six months earlier, with Rabin and Arafat's blessing, a <a href=\"http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/beilinmazen.html\">blueprint</a> for a mutually acceptable deal was hammered out in secret talks under the auspices of Yossi Beilin and Mahmoud Abbas. </p> <p>The two-state solution is on life-support and if it is to be saved, the passive majority must mobilise in opposition to those who continuously veto the quest for peace by invoking God. As any just deity would know, it is the sanctity of people, not land, that matters.</p>",
  "<p>At least seven African countries or regions have cut the number of malaria deaths by half following an intensive drive to protect people from the disease, the World Health Organisation said today.</p> <p>Measures to combat malaria included bed nets, the treatment of those who fall sick and the elimination of malaria-carrying mosquitos, the WHO said.</p> <p>The success stories include Eritrea, Rwanda and the island of Sao Tome and Principe, which are not only managing to prevent and treat malaria but also have good data on cases and deaths. </p> <p>In a report on the global burden of the disease, published today, the WHO says more countries may be bringing death rates down but do not yet have statistical proof.</p> <p>\"With dramatic increases in funding and intense momentum towards reducing the malaria burden in recent years, we have a greater need for reliable information and analysis,\" said the WHO director general, Margaret Chan. </p> <p>\"Progress in malaria control has accelerated dramatically since 2006, especially in the wake of the UN secretary general's call for universal malaria control coverage by the end of 2010.

Nearly all who died (91%) were in Africa, and 85% were children under the age of five.</p> <p>There is now general agreement on a package of measures to fight malaria.</p> <p>But drugs, bed nets and sprays are slow to get to where they are needed, particularly in the worst-hit areas of Africa.

  "<p>Until <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2008/09/18/20080918death0918whitfield.html \">yesterday</a> I was still holding out the slenderest hope of somehow securing an interview with Norman Whitfield, the reclusive genius of psychedelic soul. I knew that this was extremely unlikely given his ongoing struggles with a) illness and b) the IRS, not to mention a longstanding reluctance to talk to the press. In 2005, he was sentenced to six months house arrest for tax evasion, avoiding imprisonment only because of diabetes and other health problems. He spent the last few months at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles. Yesterday I heard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyA_DNw2vyg\">through the grapevine</a> that he passed away on Tuesday afternoon.<br> Following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/aug/12/popandrock.jazz \">the death of Isaac Hayes last month</a>, it's been a bad year for fans of heavily orchestrated, epic soul. Hayes and Whitfield were two of my heroes for the way they redrew the boundaries of soul, letting songs thunder and swirl far beyond the traditional pop song format. But while Hayes was a famously charming and outgoing character \u2013 hence those frustratingly reductive obits that mentioned Shaft and South Park and left it at that \u2013 Whitfield was always a mystery.<br> He was born in Harlem in 1943. In his memoir <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Be-Loved-Music-Memories-Motown/dp/0446602361 \">To Be Loved</a>, Motown founder Berry Gordy remembers the young Whitfield as a tall, shy man who earned a living in his teens as a hotshot pool player. A junior figure at Hitsville, hungry for his big break, he hung around the studio watching more established producers such as <a href=\"http://www.hollanddozierholland.com/\">Holland-Dozier-Holland</a> at work. After writing hits for Marvin Gaye, the Marvelettes and the Velvelettes, he wrested creative control of the Temptations from Smokey Robinson in 1966 with the success of Ain't Too Proud to Beg.<br> Whitfield's big chance came when Holland-Dozier-Holland stormed out of Motown in early 1968 in a row over profit-sharing. Inspired by Sly and the Family Stone's wild arrangements, he wrote the hard-driving, socially aware <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBxFTzxc0Bo\">Cloud Nine</a> with lyricist Barrett Strong (who is himself currently recovering from a stroke) for the Temptations. Despite Gordy's reservations over its perceived pro-drug message, it changed Motown overnight. Suddenly, topical comment and audacious psychedelic arrangements were on the agenda, and Whitfield-Strong were on a roll: Ball of Confusion, Papa Was a Rollin' Stone, War and Smilin' Faces Sometimes all smouldered with tension and paranoia befitting the era of Vietnam, Nixon and the Black Panthers. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d8C4AIFgUg\">War</a> actually <em>sounds</em> like war; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BJOXopGW8g\">Ball of Confusion</a> is indeed a ball of confusion.<br> Whitfield's rise was down to a cocktail of talent, ego, luck and, most of all, persistence. If he thought something was a hit, he would keep pushing until it was. Gordy refused to release versions of I Heard It Through the Grapevine by the Miracles, the Isley Brothers and Marvin Gaye. Undeterred,<br>Whitfield gave the song to Gladys Knight and the Pips, who made it Motown's best-selling single to date. The following year, Gordy finally succumbed and Gaye's version was even bigger. This was a classic Whitfield strategy. War was recorded by the Temptations before Edwin Starr, and Papa Was a Rollin' Stone was tried out on Whitfield's pet group the Undisputed Truth prior to the Temptations.<br> <br>But success corrupted the once-shy outsider. A demanding egotist in the studio, he worked the Temptations into the ground. On the cover of their last album together, 1973's Masterpiece, his own picture loomed larger than the band's. That year he left Motown to set up Whitfield Records but his only subsequent major success was Rose Royce, who released the likes of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvAhDDqqHls\">Car Wash</a> and Wishing on a Star, and he retired from music in the early 80s.<br> <br>Whitfield's motives are still unclear - was he truly passionate about social change or just a canny hitmaker who sensed the mood of the times and catered to it? Either way, he changed the landscape of soul. Thanks to him, songs could pass the 10-minute mark, use every studio trick available and speak to the concerns of a tougher, angrier black America. He paved the way for classics such as What Going On and Innervisions within Motown, plus hard-hitting political statements by the likes of the O'Jays and the Isley Brothers outside of it.</p> <p>The critic Greil Marcus remembers friends who pulled their cars over the first time they heard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwUS9yjFYy8\">Papa Was a Rollin' Stone</a> and sat \"waiting, shivering, as the song crept out of the box and filled up the night\". I'll be doing something similar tonight.</p>",

  "<p>The Chinese tainted milk scare spread to ice cream and yoghurt today as health investigators found further traces of the chemical that has killed at least three infants and left more than 6,000 ill.</p> <p>Thousands of parents took their children to hospital for health checks after unconfirmed reports that the chemical melamine had claimed a fourth victim. </p> <p>An independent food watchdog in Hong Kong found eight out of the 30 dairy products they tested contained traces of the chemical, normally used in plastics. Hong Kong authorities immediately ordered the withdrawal of the latest goods, produced by the Chinese firm Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group.</p> <p>Constance Chan, the controller of Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety, told Reuters: \"We are recalling the Yili products and the importer is also recalling all Yili products from the Yili brand.</p> <p>\"That would involve milk, milk beverages, yoghurt, ice cream and ice bar. Eight out of 30 products of Yili company contain melamine.\"</p> <p>China had previously identified melamine only in milk powder.</p> <p>\"In the next few days we will test all other mainland Chinese (dairy) products,\" Chan said. \"Any Chinese milk powder no matter where it is made on the mainland will be tested.\"</p> <p>Police in China today arrested 12 more people as part of their investigation. There were already 18 suspects being held and another 87 summoned for questioning.</p> <p>News of the contamination first began with reports that dozens of babies in Gansu province had developed kidney stones after drinking milk formula.</p> <p>Officials said subsequent tests found melamine in batches at 22 of China's 109 milk powder manufacturers, including its two biggest dairies, Mengniu and Yili Industrial Group.</p> <p>The health minister, Chen Zhu, said that 6,244 babies had fallen ill, 1,327 were in hospital and 158 had acute kidney failure. He expected the number of cases to rise.</p> <p>Chen said that so far all the sick infants had consumed milk powder made by the Sanlu group, the country's biggest formula producer. Li Changjiang, the head of China's quality control agency, said 5,000 inspectors would monitor companies and all dairy products would be tested for melamine.</p> <p>The chemical is banned from use in food, but adding it to watered-down milk makes it appear higher in protein when tested.</p> <p>China has tried to tighten food safety after repeated scares. In 2004, more than 200 infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed formula containing no nutrients. An estimated 1,500 dogs and cats died in the US last year from a melamine-tainted pet food ingredient made in China.</p> <p>The Sanlu case is particularly alarming because the recall took so long and apparently required the intervention of the New Zealand government, which was alerted by Sanlu's New Zealand-based partner, Fonterra. New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, said on Monday that she ordered her officials to leapfrog regional authorities and tell Beijing directly.</p> <p>Today, Shi Guizhong, a spokesman for the Hebei provincial police, said government officials were starting a 10-day campaign to focus on the melamine contamination.</p> <p>Officers had confiscated 300kg (660lb) of suspected chemicals, including 490lb of melamine, he said.</p> <p>Shi said one suspect, surnamed Su, told police that from February 2007 to July 2008 he bought 200 sacks each containing 20kg of melamine and sold them all to milk suppliers.</p> <p>Yang Chongyong, the deputy governor of Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, said the firm received customer complaints from March but waited until August 2 before telling the city government of Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. Officials there waited more than a month, until September 9, to tell the provincial government.</p> <p>The Hebei authorities took the problem to central government the following day and Sanlu finally ordered a recall.</p> <p>Andrew Ferrier, the chief executive of Fonterra, which owns 43% of Sanlu, said it had urged disclosure \"from day one\".</p> <p>The state news agency Xinhua reported that the mayor and four other city officials of Shijiazhuang had been fired. Sanlu's general manager, Tian Wenhua, was arrested, along with milk suppliers who were either arrested or questioned.</p> <p>China is the world's second largest market for infant formula. Ding Bing, the China coordinator for the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, said: \"The milk powder companies do advertisements which exaggerate the effects of their products and make the mothers doubt [the quality of] their own milk.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Additional research by Chen Shi</p>",

Or let's look at this another way: hurrah! Any residual guilt about letting those spin and Power Plate classes fall at the wayside can be ditched. This is because next season it is all about tents. That bikini diet (cheers Grazia) really can be kicked to the corner this time round. Like it was, um, last year. And the year before. And \u2013 oh, whatever.</p> <p>The oversized clothing trend has been building up for some time and when I say \"some time\" I actually mean \"this current autumn/winter season\" \u2013 but then, two seasons in a row is a downright eternity. Last week in New York and now in London we saw some full on sack-shaped clothes coming down the runways. Yesterday's Betty Jackson show featured dresses so voluminous at least one member of the audience was planning to buy one to live in at the Glastonbury festival next summer. Jackson has always been a fan of the baggy \u2013 hence her appeal among the All Saints, who have never knowingly turned down a slouchy trouser \u2013 but in recent seasons she seems to have crossed the line from 'baggy clothes' to just 'big bit of fabric.' Similar, I grant you, but different. </p> <p>And while on the one hand I long to applaud a trend that positively encourages bloated stomachs (and, you know, me), on the other I can't help but wonder\u2026 is there not a middle ground between structured body con and burlap sacks?</p> <p><strong>Quote of the day</strong></p> <p>\"Oh my God, I just stepped on a royal!\" <br>As heard at Anya Hindmarch, when a fashion editor got too close to Hindmarch fan, Lady Helen Taylor</p> <p><strong>Trendwatch</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337719621\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/KaneshoeAP2.jpg\" alt=\"Statement shoes on model at Christopher Kane's show\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Brightly coloured accessories:</strong> Drab clothes at Betty Jackson were teamed with fluro strappy footwear.

  "<p>With the nationalisation of Fannie and Freddie, comrades Bush, Paulson and Bernanke started transforming the US into the USSRA (United Socialist State Republic of America). </p> <p>This transformation of the US into a country where there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/wallstreet.useconomy\">socialism for the rich</a>, the well-connected and Wall Street (ie, where profits are privatised and losses are socialised) continues today with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">nationalisation of AIG</a>.</p> <p>This latest action on AIG follows a variety of many other policy actions that imply a massive \u2013 and often flawed \u2013 government intervention in the financial markets and the economy: the bail-out of the Bear Stearns creditors; the bail-out of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/07/freddiemacfanniemae\">Fannie and Freddie</a>; the use of the Fed balance sheet (hundreds of billions of safe US Treasuries swapped for junk, toxic, illiquid private securities); the use of the other GSEs (the <a href=\"http://www.fhlbanks.com/\">Federal Home Loan Bank</a> system) to provide hundreds of billions of dollars of \"liquidity\" to distressed, illiquid and insolvent mortgage lenders; the use of the SEC to manipulate the stock market (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/regulators.stockmarkets\">through restrictions on short sales</a>). </p> <p>Then there's the use of the US Treasury to manipulate the mortgage market, the creation of a whole host of new bail-out facilities to prop and rescue banks and, for the first time since the Great Depression, to bail out non-bank financial institutions. </p> <p>This is the biggest and most socialist government intervention in economic affairs since the formation of the Soviet Union and Communist China. So foreign investors are now welcome to the USSRA (the United Socialist State Republic of America) where they can earn fat spreads relative to Treasuries on agency debt and never face any credit risks (not even the subordinated debt-holders who made a fortune yesterday as those claims were also made whole).</p> <p>Like scores of evangelists and hypocrites and moralists who spew and praise family values and pretend to be holier than thou and are then regularly caught cheating or found to be perverts, these Bush hypocrites who spewed for years the glory of unfettered Wild West laissez-faire jungle capitalism allowed the biggest debt bubble ever to fester without any control, and have caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. </p> <p>They are are now forced to perform the biggest government intervention and nationalisations in the recent history of humanity, all for the benefit of the rich and the well connected. So Comrades Bush and Paulson and Bernanke will rightly pass to the history books as a troika of Bolsheviks who turned the USA into the USSRA. </p> <p>Zealots of any religion are always pests that cause havoc with their inflexible fanaticism \u2013 but they usually don't run the biggest economy in the world. These laissez faire voodoo-economics zealots in charge of the USA have now caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression and the nastiest economic crisis in decades. </p> <p><em>This article first appeared on <a href=\"http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini\">Nouriel Roubini's blog</a> and is edited and cross-posted here with the permission of the author. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html\">Nicknamed \"Dr Doom\"</a>, Professor Roubini is now widely acknowledged as having accurately predicted the present crises in financial markets.</em></p> <p><em>This blog was amended at 17.00 on Thursday 18 September, to include more of Nouriel Roubini's original post.</em></p>",
  "<p>Also at the Grand Rapids forum, Palin was asked by a former Hillary supporter about her plans to empower women.</p> <p>Of course again the answer was completely vapid, with nothing about equal pay or help with child care and medical leave or any of the stuff that the GOP flatly opposes because of its corporate sponsors but always lies about at election time trying to fool people into thinking they're for.</p> <p>Instead, Palin said this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Now, I was a product of Title IX where legislation allowed that equal opportunity. Now if we have to still keep going down that road to create more legislation, to get with it in the 21st century, to make sure that women do have equality especially in the work place, then we're there because we understand that in this age we have all got to be working together,\" Palin said. \"But yup, equality for women, for all, that's going to be part of the agenda and I thank you for that question.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, for you Brits, Title IX, explained <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_ix\">here</a>, is a 1970s federal law that required colleges and universities to put a lot more money into women's athletics. The result has been as intended: an explosion in women's sports, a great thing. But also not as intended: Because athletic departments have finite resources, they've had to get rid of something. </p> <p>And since they're under federal mandate to keep women's programs, men's teams of various sorts have been eliminated or cut back all across the country. In non-revenue-producing sports like wrestling and tennis and gymnastic and so on, the fellas have suffered adversely. </p> <p>My alma mater in my home state, West Virginia University, has the best college men's rifle team in the country (we <em>are </em>the Mountaineers, after all!). We're the UCLA, the Man United, the New York Yankees of rifelry. I think 13 national championships. A few years ago, they had to eliminate the team. Some creative financing brought it back, but the point is that Title IX is extremely unpopular with a lot of red-blooded, middle-American males.</p> <p>Palin, as has been explained lately, is actually <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/08/women_more_skeptical_of_palin_than_men.php\">more popular (has higher approval ratings) with men than with women</a>. If I were a devious Democratic consultant, I'd make sure via under-the-radar means like fliers and so forth that the red-blooded males of Ohio, Florida and other swing states with lots of colleges knew that Sarah Palin's only idea about women's equality was an idea that has come at the direct expense of male college athletes across the country! Chip, chip, chip, chip away. Every bit matters.<br></p>",
  "<p>There are some things we were never meant to see. Now, thanks to high definition technology, we can see them only too clearly. The <a href=\"http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tv3.htm\">cathode ray tube</a> has, sometime in the last year or so, vanished from TV showrooms. Nobody mourns its passing; it was basically a gun firing radiation at goggle-eyed viewers. Besides, you go out to buy a TV now and there's a sea of gorgeous, shiny new flat-screen LCDs and plasmas to wade through, most bearing a sticker claiming they are, as you should be by now, \"<a href=\"http://www.hdready.org.uk/\">HD Ready</a>\".</p> <p>When we eventually join this century by getting the fibre optic phone lines we deserve, pretty much everything we watch will be in some form of HD. At the moment, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/may/02/blurayplayersarestillaflo\">Blu-ray</a> is the frontline for getting these close-to-perfect, four-times-clearer-than-DVD images into our homes. But unless you have a PlayStation 3 or have invested in a stand-alone player, HD is still something from the future.</p> <p>Now, I watch a lot of films. Loads of them, for work and pleasure, on a variety of formats. From small screening rooms to large West End cinemas and IMAX screens; from DVDs to downloads. The variety in terms of picture quality can be staggering, but it's all infinitely better than the virtually unwatchable <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2003/jan/25/comment.comment\">VHS bootlegs</a> of A Clockwork Orange and Last House On The Left I happily endured in my youth. I love a good picture, so I thought the precision offered by HD would give my straining eyes a rest, cleansing the palette of bad prints, poorly mastered and full of grain. Far from it. You can see everything. Everything.</p> <p>Films suddenly become more detailed, more textured to a distracting level. Pages of dialogue fly by, important plotlines and revelations go unnoticed as you spend minutes staring at the fabric of costumes, the wallpaper, even the hair. Try watching any of the remastered Star Trek original series without having your eyes continually locked on Shatner's dubious hairline. The camera may add a few pounds but under HD it adds a few years as well. I watched the standard DVD of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/118400/no.country.for.old.men\">No Country For Old Men</a> then saw Tommy Lee Jones again in the Blu-ray of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119598/in.the.valley.of.elah\">In The Valley Of Elah</a>, two films made in the same year. In the first, Jones looked merely craggy, in the second, it was as if putrefaction had set in. On a big enough screen, HD offers a dizzying level of detail. It's hard to know what you are supposed to be looking at when everything looks so wonderful. </p> <p>Check out any HD forums and you'll find plenty of voices bemoaning the fate of older films under such scrutiny. Outmoded tricks such as backdrops, <a href=\"http://mattepainting.org/\">matte paintings</a> and miniatures reveal their fakery instantly. Personally, I don't find this too serious a problem; I'd much rather see an unconvincing model or painting where you can see the work that went into it over an unconvincing slice of CGI. I'd even go so far as to say that older films is where HD should be concentrating - it makes them look almost modern while still preserving, accentuating even, the film-makers' original intentions. Errol Flynn's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029843/\">The Adventures Of Robin Hood</a> on HD looks far closer to the original Technicolor style than any transfer I've seen before; John Ford's The Searchers shows off the carefully composed, deep-focus, large format Vista-vision images more dramatically than ever; the curved letterboxing aping the original Cinerama on How The West Was Won is highly effective; and Casablanca is almost like looking through a black and white window into the past. Stunning.</p> <p>If anything, it's harsher on modern films. Without the illumination and slight diffusion offered by movie screens, stars look far less stellar. Skin blemishes and hairpieces vie for unwanted attention. HD is particularly merciless on reflections. Any surface with even a slight kick to it reveals camera crews, bystanders, movie equipment. You might think these are occupational hazards but check out the HD versions of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner. These two films are faultless no matter how many times you view them and still reveal new details to the viewer \u2013 I've seen both countless times but never before spotted the country of origin markings on the first spaceships you see in 2001 or the Spinner police cars parked atop the buildings in Blade Runner.</p> <p>Have you been bitten by the HD bug? Do you find it too expensive with too poor a selection of movies currently available to take the plunge? Maybe you just wish display screens showed something other than the fabulous-on-any-format Pixar CGI movies? Am I just experiencing teething troubles or have I entered a world where movies have had their magic stripped away?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> King's Cliffe, Northamptonshire.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Ben Duffy (vocals, keyboards), Ross Duffy (guitar), Dan Soler (bass, keyboards).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Of the 50 groups performing at this year's In The City unsigned-band-fest taking place in Manchester in early October, Fenech-Soler would appear, to these ears anyway, to be the best, the most promising, the ones bursting with techno-pop potential. Still only in their late teens, they're a synth-bass-guitar outfit from a tiny village near Peterborough but they sound as though they've just stepped out of a hi-tech recording palace in LA, Paris or London with someone expensive at the controls. Although they cite Michael Jackson circa Dangerous as their sole influence on their MySpace, they sound more like Italian-French pure electronic artist Vitalic, Aussie synth-pop crew Cut Copy or one of those Franco-funk pop troupes with an 80s fetish like Daft Punk or Phoenix. <br> With a firm grasp of club dynamics combined with an acute pop sensibility, Fenech-Soler have managed to create a big, thick sound on a strict budget, all magisterial, fizzing keyboards, buoyant bass and treated, delay-drenched guitars, topped off with disco cowbells, computer FX and attractive teen-boy vocals that sound as though they could have come from anywhere but the middle of nowhere in the middle of the UK. The trio might be currently without a record deal, but if and when they do get signed, inevitably their debut single will be The Cult of Romance, a flawless performance with a fabulous melody, lush chords and synth-handclaps that you could easily imagine being a hit. It has even been compared to a Justin Timberlake track, with the same lightness of touch and effortless commercial appeal without sounding remotely forced. The lyric \"I just want to get with you someday/I don't want to let you down, baby\" is just made for maximum daytime radio hummability and gig chantability. They may be electro wonder kids who know their way round a studio, but they can cut it live, too, and have accrued a sizable live following after performances at London's Clapham Grand and the Ministry of Sound, where they proved they can incorporate \"real\" instruments alongside their laptops and assorted gadgetry.  Basically, Magistrates and Boy Crisis, those other highly touted new white funk troupes, have a serious rival. Fenech-Soler, who are based around the Duffy brothers and their equally handsome mate Dan Soler, are set to start work on a debut EP with producer Mark Brydon of Moloko fame, and if they don't become huge stars or cult-cred dance-pop heroes by the start of next year we'll eat our hat, which fortunately is made of delicious scented rice paper so it doesn't really matter to us either way. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Sounds bigger than anything currently recorded by the likes of Klaxons, Friendly Fires et al.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Mark our words \u2013 the ITC shebang is as good as theirs. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Raise the roof in Manchester. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Become professional roofers in Manchester \u2013 not while the credit crunch lasts anyway. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The single The Cult of Romance, we confidently predict, will be released as soon as the band get signed. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Phoenix, Vitalic, Cut Copy, Das Pop. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/fenechsoler\">www.myspace.com/fenechsoler</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Fort Knox Five. <br> </p>",
  "<p>Instead of sipping martinis from cocktail glasses, socialites at this month's New York Fashion Week were paying to spit into test tubes. The <a href=\" http://spittoon.23andme.com/tag/spit-party/\">'Spit Party' was held by 23andMe</a>, an American genetic testing company that recently made headlines by slashing the price of its genetic analyses to $399 (\u00a3220).<br><br>While 23andMe's customers usually sign up from home, the Spit Party seems to be part of its strategy of turning genetic testing into a social activity. Once online customers have sent off their samples and have received their results (<a href=\" https://www.23andme.com/health/all/\">for everything from risk of lung cancer and cardiac disease, to restless legs syndrome and the ability to detect particular odours</a>) they can join various communities on the company's website.</p> <p>People shown to be slow caffeine metabolisers could unite in their trait, while people at risk of suffering psoriasis might share coping tips.</p> <p>According to Anne Wojcicki, co-founder of 23andMe and wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipbUmTKmicQ5LdPpdoX67PYx7FqAD932VHIO0\">the company's mission is to \"enable anyone to be able to get access to their genetic information\"</a>. Telling people about their own genes might sound morally straightforward, but is there a risk that by making the whole process socially glamorous, consumers could be coralled into doing it for the wrong reasons?</p> <p>Nilesh Samani, a cardiologist at the University of Leicester, recently joined <a href=\"http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/news/0105/91.htm\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/health/08diab.html\">experts</a> in warning against the proliferation of commercial DNA testing, claiming that trying to predict someone's risk of suffering strokes or heart attacks could cause them <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5ghc-3bJ8pNOgyVV9VARdw4Lk0E3g\">unecessary anxiety if the results are not properly interpreted</a>.</p> <p>The problem arises from perceptions of risk. For instance, a test might reveal that someone is three times as likely to develop coeliac disease as the average person, but their risk of becoming diabetic is only half of the general population average. </p> <h2>Misleading statistics?</h2> <p>Of course, the absolute figures for risk tell a different story. Regardless of your personal, genetically confirmed, relative risk of diabetes, you should probably be far more concerned about watching your sugar intake than about a condition in your guts that often doesn't even produce any symptoms. </p> <p>The statistics are misleading because it's your absolute personal risk that makes a difference to your health, rather than your risk relative to other people.</p> <p>23andMe, and their competitors such as <a href=\"http://www.genetic-health.co.uk/\">GeneticHealth</a>, <a href=\" http://www.decodeme.com/\">deCODEme</a> and <a href=\"http://www.navigenics.com/\">Navigenics</a> , all say that they ensure customers receive the correct genetic counselling so they can make sense of their results. But how engaged with the process can someone be when they're dropping their saliva samples off at a fashion party? </p> <p>It would be sad, and ironic, if someone's results stressed them enough to exacerbate a health problem, or lulled them into a false sense of security. And will people really have thought through the implications of finding out they're at high risk of developing a brain disorder like CJD as they get older?</p> <p>Impacts on health and risk perception are only some of the consequences that need to be thought through before going ahead with a genetic test. There is currently <a href=\" http://www.phgfoundation.org/news/4249/\">a moratorium on UK insurers' use of genetic testing data to set premiums</a>, but that only lasts until 2014. It's not inconceivable that, while you might not be forced to be profiled, any tests that you have taken could be used to judge your health risks. After all, insurers already discriminate over one obvious bit of genetic information: whether you have a Y chromosome or not.</p> <p>Although New Yorkers seem happy to host Spit Parties, the genetic testing industry faces opposition on the other side of America, 23andMe's home state of California. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/19/genetics.usa\">The state's department of public health issued cease-and-desist orders to 13 companies</a> over concerns that they weren't competent enough to offer the kind of advice they were trying to.</p> <p>Genetic profiling can give you the chance to control your own health better, or even lead to more effective personalised treatments. But the information it gives isn't simple, nor are the long-term implications clear yet. By all means, people should have the choice to pay for it, but is giving them the opportunity to join genetic clubs the right way to entice them?</p>",
  "<p>For the past month, women in Georgia who were displaced from Abkhazia during the 1993 conflict have witnessed history moving backwards; everything they lived through 15 years ago is repeating itself. These women are now hosting a new flood of displaced civilians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia after Russia's aggression in those regions, as well as within the Georgian territories that Russian forces have occupied since the invasion. In Tbilisi alone, there are more than 500 camps for internally displaced people, many of them women and children living with shortages of food and <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=0ED335E8-15C5-F00A-253368F3F9A64E9D&amp;component=toolkit.article&amp;method=full_html\">medical supplies</a>.</p> <p>Georgians today hardly feel supportive of their president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who, in a foolish attempt to regain control over South Ossetia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/georgia.russia\">turn its full military might</a> Russia to drop its peacekeeping mission in the region and to pushing Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and then to occupying much of Georgia. The Russians bombed numerous strategic and civilian targets in Georgia, destroying infrastructure resulting in shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. </p> <p>People are in despair; they are angry at Russia for its aggression and at their own government for provoking this uneven conflict. People of different nationalities and ethnicities have been living in this region side by side for centuries, sharing customs, traditions, bread and wine, and mutual respect for each another's cultures and languages. But, going back to the Russian, British, and Ottoman Empires that once battled here, they have been continually exploited by politicians and generals. </p> <p>Women and children suffer the most in times of conflict. Add to this centuries-old patriarchal traditions, 15-year-old post-war traumas, a 20-year economic crisis, and current Russian aggression, and you may begin to grasp what women in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Georgia are enduring these days. </p> <p>Besides the general devastation that modern warfare brings, impoverished and angry Russian soldiers were wreaking havoc on civilians by stealing belongings left behind and raping women. In addition, lawlessness was enticing bandits to cross the border and vandalise and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/georgia.russia\">rob properties</a> left by fleeing refugees. News reports and \"analysis\" by state-controlled channels in both Russia and Georgia that promote negative images of \"the enemy\" serve only to widen the gap between ethnic groups. </p> <p>Over the past month, concerned citizens in both Russia and Georgia have started to make attempts to build alliances and reach out to each other outside of the government-controlled media and structures. There have been action calls and statements circulated on the web calling on the people of the region to unite and not allow governments to build bigger walls between them. </p> <p>Despite government propaganda, the region's people must remember that Russians are not superior to Georgians, Georgians to Ossetians or Abkhazians, and so on. We need to stop these territorial battles based on national pride and desire to control and rule. Saakashvili must be pressured to abandon his effort to wield full control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. At the same time, the Russian government must be pressured to pull out of the Caucasus and let people there decide their future for themselves. </p> <p>Now is the time for Georgian, Russian, Abkazian, and Ossetian civilians who are bearing the brunt of the conflict to come together to stop imperial chess games that kill thousands of people and leave thousands more displaced and emotionally wounded. It is time to help civil society in this area build a world where peace, not warfare, is the rule. </p> <p>Women's rights activists in the region should not fall into a brainwashing trap of nationalism and territorial disputes, becoming another tool in the hands of politicians. They should demonstrate to their governments that they will not succumb to divisive ideology. </p> <p><em> Angelika Arutyunova is programme officer for Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at the Global Fund for Women.</em></p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

  "<p><strong>10.30am</strong> A prompt start and a lovely autumn morning, although there are headaches for both Lancashire and Kent, <em>writes Andy Wilson at Aigburth</em>. Lancashire's are obvious enough - after being skittled for 107 inside 39 overs yesterday, they are odds-on to slump to a three-point defeat in this match which would leave them with one foot in the second division. They are also in theoretical danger of a points deduction as Chris Broad, the ECB's pitch liaison officer, is here for a second day, although he has already hinted that Lancashire will not be punished. For Kent, meanwhile, some of the satisfaction after seizing control of the game yesterday may have been dented by fresh reports linking their former South Africa coach Graham Ford with the New Zealand job that will become vacant when John Bracewell joins Gloucestershire early next year.</p> <p><strong>10.50am</strong> It's an upliftingly beautiful morning in Scarborough, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. Yorkshire awarded county caps to Adil Rashid and Andrew Gale before play got under way - not before time in the case of the former, and perhaps prematurely in the case of the latter. Rashid is straight into the attack, from the Peasholme Park End of the ground, but while his first ball bit and turned, it's Matthew Hoggard who has made an early breakthrough, Arul Suppiah driving loosely at a widish delivery to edge a catch behind. Somerset 167-4.</p> <p><strong>11.55am</strong> Chester-le-Street is no longer the most unwanted lake in Durham, it is once again a cricket ground, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. The wading birds are no more, dragonfly hunters must look elsewhere and -- half an hour late on the second morning - we have cricket. It's a vital game, too, with Durham desperate for victory against Sussex to press their claims to a first championship title.</p> <p>Durham have sprung a surprise, too. Calculating that they must bowl out Sussex twice in a shortened match, they have called up a second spinner, Gareth Breese, for his first championship match of the season. Mark Stoneman, the young opener, has been dropped and Ben Harmison opens the batting despite a championship average this season of 15.</p> <p>Durham are batting after losing the toss, Harmison has survived the shock well enough in the first 40 minutes and Durham are 39-0. It's an odd ground this, excellent new Test venue in some regards, and yet look the other way and it remains strangely pot-holed behind the large popular stand. With Lumley Castle in the distance, one half expects a serf to appear through the puddles swigging a glass of mead and singing an ancient north-eastern ditty.</p> <p><strong>12.10pm</strong> Kent have just been bowled out for 233, a decent effort by the Lancashire seamers, but still earning the title hopefuls a first innings lead of 126, which should prove decisive in a low-scoring match. The pitch has continued to play the odd trick although Justin Kemp followed the example of Steven Croft yesterday by showing the value of application, reaching a 75-ball half century only to be left unbeaten on 56. Seven of the 10 Kent wickets went lbw, with both Robbie Joseph and Joe Denly - batting at no.8 after yesterday's migraine - given the finger this morning. Oliver Newby claimed a season's best four-wicket haul for Lancashire with Croft, Tom Smith and Glen Chapple sharing the other wickets. Lancs now have a tricky 10-minute session before lunch. Nobody here is confident of their openers surviving, and a two-day finish seems highly possible.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> It's over, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at The Oval</em>. When Lancashire's Tom Smith had Kent's Yasir Arafat caught by Paul Horton up in Liverpool to secure Lancashire's third bowling point, Surrey were officially relegated. Their demise was only a matter of time, of course, and there are those who will regard the bizarre events here this morning as characteristic of a self-destructive season. </p> <p>Surrey's problems began when Shoaib Akhtar top-edged Andre Adams into his neck, staggered around for a bit, then fell to the ground, where he lay for at least five minutes. Only belatedly did everyone realise he had hit his wicket in the process, so fans were treated to the tragic-comedy of the groundsmen sweeping the pitch ahead of the Nottinghamshire reply as Shoaib lay poleaxed. He eventually struggled to his feet and there was a smattering of applause from the Surrey members as he walked off. The suggestion that they were relieved he might not have to bowl was unkind. </p> <p>Matters took a turn for the worse as Notts set off in reply to Surrey's 267. In the second over, Stuart Meaker's first in championship cricket, the Surrey keeper Jon Batty was flummoxed by a ball that bounced awkwardly in front of him and rolled away in agony. The middle finger of his left hand had been dislocated and he was rushed to hospital to determine whether it was broken. Not for the first time this season Alan Butcher scratched his head and Mark Ramprakash looked disconsolate. </p> <p>And so the gloves were handed to Scott Newman. He was quickly in the thick of the action as Will Jefferson threw the bat at Meaker and got a thick edge in Newman's general direction. The ball popped out of his gloves and looped gently to Usman Afzaal at second slip: Notts 15 for one. Shoaib, meanwhile, had made a miraculous recovery, and was bowling again by the ninth over. But the game is now all about whether Nottinghamshire can press home their advantage. With 10 minutes to go before lunch, they were 46 for one.</p> <p><strong>12.45pm </strong>The sun came out here today and Worcestershire must have regretted their decision to bat first on the opening day when there was plenty of help for the bowlers, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Kidderminister</em>. Andrew Strauss and Owais Shah, who owe Middlesex a few runs, looked in no trouble at all as they took their second wicket stand to 129. But then they lost four wickets for 10 runs in the space of 6 overs. Strauss had just completed his first championship century since the beginning of last season when he turned a delivery from Gareth Batty straight into the hands of Stephen Moore at leg-slip.</p> <p>Eoin Morgan was then well caught low down at slip by Vikram Solanki off Gareth Andrew and the same bowler then had Dawid Malan caught behind. In the next over, the 52nd, Batty knocked back Ben Scott's off stump as the batsman played back defensively and was surprised by a ball that didn't turn. At lunch Middlesex are 240-5 but Shah is till there for 67.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm: </strong>Ben Harmison has achieved his first task as Durham's emergency opener by batting through a shortened morning session against Sussex, <em>writes David Hopps at Chester-le-Street</em>. The Lesser Harmison is 19 not out at lunch, from 52 balls, and Durham are 55-1. They will be reasonably happy with that after losing the toss in helpful bowling conditions. Harmison's most fortunate shot got him off the mark - a squirt past the slips off Mohammad Sami - but a straight drive against Sami as lunch approached told that he was beginning to get the hang of it. Who knows: if he gets a score, it might just stir his career to go up a notch.</p> <p>Much of the talk up here is of Surrey's relegation. Do father and son partnerships ever work? Or are they doomed to failure? There again, my Dad retired the very day I made my village cricket debut - and that never did me any good.</p> <p><strong>3.25pm: </strong>Carnage, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at The Oval</em>. Yesterday, the session between lunch and tea brought Surrey 59 runs in 33 overs. Nottinghamshire have just managed 187 off 37; to describe Surrey as a shambles would be halfway towards the truth. After Bilal Shafayat was caught for 44, cutting at Murtaza Hussain to provide a catch for the stand-in wicketkeeper Dan Euston - a 24-year-old called up from Malden Wanderers in the Surrey league following Jon Batty's finger dislocation - Notts moved into a different gear thanks to Mark Wagh and in particular Samit Patel. By tea, the pair had added 131 in 23 overs and taken their side to the brink of a first-innings lead.</p> <p>If Wagh was typically elegant, Patel was brutal, especially against the spinners. Hussain disappeared over long-off, and Afzaal was slog-swept for two sixes, the second of them almost intercepted by a back-pedalling Shoaib Akhtar at deep midwicket. Shoaib being Shoaib, he landed dramatically on his back and, for the second time in the day, looked rather dazed. Since he had spent most of the afternoon session in the dressing room \"not feeling great\" (the words of a club spokesman), there was little sympathy from the small crowd, but we mustn't be too cynical: the blow he took in the morning while batting against Andre Adams looked nasty.</p> <p>Anyway, this game isn't all about Shoaib, believe it or not. With Wagh on 93 and Patel 85 off 80 balls, Nottinghamshire have the ideal platform to hammer nails in coffins after tea and set themselves up for the victory that would encourage dreams of the county championship. We could be in for more fun after the break.</p> <p><strong>3.45pm: </strong>Worcestershire are 13-1 in their second innings at tea here on the second day so good progress is being made in this match, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Kidderminster</em>. Not that that suits Worcestershire, particularly. At this point, with five points from the game, they need just one more to clinch promotion. Draw points would be more than enough but with the weather set fair there should be a result.</p> <p>Middlesex had a first innings lead of 56 after making 321. They would have wanted more than that but they lost their last nine wickets for 106 runs in 33 overs. After lunch, Shah was sixth out at 267 when he edged one from Gareth Andrew after reaching 81. After that the only meaningful resistance came from Shaun Udal (31) and Steve Finn (26 not out). Andrew, the former Somerset man, finished with 5-58, the first five-wicket return of his career.</p> <p>Just before tea, Moore was bowled by Alan Richardson. He appeared to get an inside edge to one that kept a low but he should probably have been on the front foot. Perhaps that's being a little picky because Moore, after all, has finished the season with the little matter of 1,451 runs.</p> <p>Communications are getting better here. We are just a few miles away from the Black Country and it has felt as if we have been in some huge black hole for the first day or so. Some mobiles haven't worked, power has been on and off and wifi access has been more off than on. So if you don't here from me again you know why. Worcestershire County Cricket Club must be the only folk in the country who don't realise that it occasionally rains in Worcester and that they have to make alternative arrangements!</p> <p><strong>3.50pm: </strong>The tone of this game has changed, <em>writes Andy Wilson at Aigburth</em>, with yesterday's dampness long gone, and Lancashire's batsmen making enough of an improvement on their first-innings performance to persuade Kent captain Rob Key to turn to his spinners for the last few overs before tea. But Kent are still well on top, with Lancashire effectively 26 for four. </p> <p>They suffered the anticipated pre-lunch blow, Mark Chilton gloving Yasir Arafat's third ball down the leg-side, and although Paul Horton made some amends for his shocking first-innings dismissal with 29 in a second-wicket stand of 62 with Karl Brown, he was out driving loosely again, this time at Amjad Khan. Brown, a 20-year-old right-hander from Atherton who has been knocking on the first-team door for some time, showed promise in making 40 from 73 balls only to give Amjad another wicket with an ugly flat-batted shot. And Key's decision to give James Tredwell a twirl paid off when Francois du Plessis was caught off bat and pad just before tea. Stuart Law, apparently carrying a finger injury after a couple of slip-fielding mishaps yesterday, is still there on 40, but a much longer captain's knock is required to save Lancashire.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm: </strong>It is a difficult psychological challenge for Durham at the moment, <em>writes David Hopps at Chester-le-Street.</em> Around the country, they see their championship rivals beginning to prosper: Nottinghamshire have almost overhauled Surrey's first innings by tea on the second day; Somerset's 300 at Scarborough, initially at least, will unnerve a Yorkshire side with relegation fears; Kent might be the wicket of Stuart Law away from forcing a quick victory against Lancashire at Liverpool.</p> <p>And at The Riverside, with the first day, lost to rain, Durham's match against Sussex is only slowly taking shape. The temptation is to dash and hope, desperate for the game to develop before its time. The need is to remain methodical, convince themselves there is still time a plenty, to build a position of strength and control the game from there.</p> <p>At tea, Durham are 192-4 from 58 overs. The pitch has lacked life since lunch, a surprise after weeks of rain, and that will unnerve them because it suggests that this game will be a prolonged affair. Their chief hopes of acceleration in the final session rests with Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 48 not out at tea. A mix-up with Dale Benkenstein should have caused one of them to be run out early in their innings, as both ended up at the wicketkeeper's end, only for Chris Nash and Rory Hamilton-Brown between them to mess up the run-out.<br> \"How can Chanderpaul be ICC Cricketer of the Year?'' asked one dyed-in-the-wool Durham soul. \"He's only got 50 runs in seven knocks at Chester-le-Street this season.'' It is fair to assume that the ICC is unlikely to go into emergency session. And, anyway, Shiv will probably have a lot more by the close.</p>",
  "<p>In typically kneejerk, crowd-pleasing fashion, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/sec-stiffens-rules-naked-short/story.aspx?guid=%7B7789308F-FFD1-40A3-A845-4B99F863CE0C%7D&amp;dist=msr_1\">last night announced</a> a toughening-up of the rules regarding \"naked short-selling\" of US securities, heralding what some see as the beginning of a process to outlaw all forms of short-selling. The practice is commonly cited as having exacerbated the current slump in global stock markets, with Lehman's CEO Dick Fuld apparently <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/darling-faces-call-for-shortselling-crackdown-after-hbos-plunge-933053.html\">threatening</a> to rip the arms off those shorting his company's stock and sending its share price crashing through the floor. However, as any honest trader would assert, short-selling is an entirely legitimate strategy in the jungle that is today's market. </p> <p>Shorting (<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/03/21/nhedgie321.xml\">selling stocks</a> the trader doesn't own in the expectation that they can buy them back cheaper later on) has acquired a reputation as the evil twin of \"going long\" on shares in the hope that they will rise in price; however, there is nothing illicit about the technique. </p> <p>There is no fundamental difference between going long or short, since both types of trade are financed on assets being lent: either money or stock. Shorting involves borrowing shares until the settlement period has expired, at which point the shares must be returned; going long involves borrowing money to pay for the shares, which is only repayable at the end of the agreed timeframe. Given their parity, and given that the stock market is heavily driven by the psychological whims of those buying and selling, if someone decides that the share price of a company is about to fall, they have as much right to act on that impulse as anyone anticipating a sudden rise.</p> <p>What is most duplicitous about the proclamations of the SEC, Fuld, and even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7618096.stm\">Alistair Darling</a>, is the way in which they have chosen to scapegoat short-sellers, purely to deflect attention from their own failure to contain the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+business/marketturmoil\">financial hurricane</a> currently engulfing bourses. If the mirror situation were in play, with a major bull market in effect, there is little to no chance that they would be complaining that \"naked long\" positions were driving the market higher. </p> <p>During the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble\">dotcom boom</a> of the late 1990s, the years of so-called \"<a href=\"http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Irrational-exuberance\">irrational exuberance</a>\", shares doubled, tripled and even quadrupled in price over the course of a few hours' trading; and while the going was good, the regulators smiled benignly upon the market players from on high. Restrictions on client borrowing were relaxed, customers were encouraged to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)\">margin</a> to take out far larger positions and thus increase brokers' commission rates, and no one batted an eyelid until things turned sour. </p> <p>Anyone caught short during the wild surges of the dotcom years was in danger of losing all their money and more, thanks to the theoretical unlimited downside risk in shorting shares. Despite their losses, they had no one to blame but themselves; it was they who called the market wrong, and they who had to pay the price when the time came to settle their debts. </p> <p>Nowadays, however, there is the absurd demand being made in some quarters that people long of stock who have lost out during this prolonged bear market should be able to lay the blame squarely at the feet of their more savvy peers who bet the other way. Because, to be honest, that is all that trading in today's market boils down to; making bets one way or another on the direction of share prices, index values, oil futures, and any other tradable commodity. As in the world of bookmaking, so in the stock market: for every backer, there is someone out there laying the price; if there wasn't, there wouldn't be a market at all. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/17/mbas.highereducation1\">Simon Cawkwell</a>, the most famous short-seller in the City, and the man who first exposed the fraud within <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1249739.stm\">Robert Maxwell's empire</a>, launched a typically scathing attack on the regulators when we spoke after the closing bell yesterday. \"[The proposed rules] are infantile; they are the emotional reaction of children\", he said mockingly.</p> <blockquote> <p>They will have no effect on the market whatsoever, [since] they have nothing to do with real life at all. They are a raft of propositions offered by very silly fools to even sillier fools.</p> </blockquote> <p>Warming to his theme, he suggested that disgruntled investors and taxpayers swivel the barrels of their guns well away from the City, and towards Westminster instead. \"The problem is not short-selling\", he assured me. </p> <blockquote> <p>The problem is the electorate who voted in a <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm/biography\">socialist</a> who thought he could run the economy. He talked about 'prudent stability' just to [ensure he became] prime minister; he's a fucking nuisance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cawkwell's ire is understandable, given that the regulators' anti-shorting overtures threaten the foundations upon which his, and thousands of other short-sellers', business is based. Darling's comment that he is \"extremely anxious that we avoid a situation where people can manipulate markets, causing huge harm that is totally unjustified\" is the stock-market equivalent of anti-immigrant racism; tarring an entire section of society with one brush, in order to unite the hordes of embittered investors in a witchhunt against their undeserving peers. </p> <p>The bottom line is that had the heads of the banking behemoths and their watchdog counterparts exerted more control over the extent of firms' exposure to high-risk debt, there wouldn't have been this degree of bear market (from which short-sellers could profit) in the first place. That no one saw it coming is a tragedy \u2013 for employees, shareholders and everyone else caught up in the crisis \u2013 but to set up straw men in a desperate attempt to play the blame game is wholly disingenuous. </p> <p>Bear raiders like Cawkwell and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chanos\">James Chanos</a> are as vulnerable to the risks they take as any other investor. They are entitled to make their money in the best way they know how, and to milk as much out of the markets as they can, based on the strength of their instinct and nous. To deny them that opportunity, based on spurious reasoning and political opportunism, is simply shutting the door of the stable five along from the one out of which the horse actually bolted. </p> <p>Furthermore, action such as the SEC has taken, rather than calming the jitters running through the market, actually threatens its stability. But that won't stop them doing it all the same, since in the current climate of fear and loathing, any points that can be scored at all are worth their weight in gold (though perhaps not at <a href=\"http://www.smartmoney.com/breaking-news/smw/index.cfm?story=20080917022355\">this week</a>'s prices), regardless of how cheap or \"childish\" they are.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, today criticised the government for not doing enough to devolve power into the hands of ordinary people.</p> <p>In a pamphlet written for <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/index.asp\">Progress,</a> Milburn said that although Gordon Brown has committed himself to putting more power into the hands of citizens, \"a splurge of Whitehall initiatives seem to point in the opposite direction\".</p> <p>Milburn, a leading Blairite and a longstanding critic of Brown, claimed \"this half-in, half-out approach won't work. Uncertainty has to make way for clarity.\"</p> <p>He argued that to win the next election, Labour has to embrace further change.</p> <p>\"One of New Labour's key strengths has been its preparedness to face the future challenge, rather than taking comfort in the past achievement. The willingness to change is what has made New Labour so dominant in British politics and forced even our most strident opponents into contemplating once again changes they once thought abhorrent. Now change beckons again.\"</p> <p> The MP was particularly critical of Labour's record on social mobility. He said that although the government has taken steps to halt the decline in social mobility, it has not done enough to break the \"glass ceiling\" that continues to hold people back if they come from a disadvantaged background.</p> <p>He said Labour can only achieve this if it shifts the focus \"beyond the traditional welfare state solution of correcting the symptoms of inequality retrospectively \u2013 such as low wages and family poverty \u2013 towards an approach that proactively deals with the roots of disadvantage before they become entrenched.\"</p> <p>Milburn also suggested various policies which he said could help improve social mobility and devolve power into the hands of ordinary people.</p> <p>\u2022 Cutting taxes for the low paid.</p> <p>\u2022 Making the police and health services accountable to local people through elections.</p> <p>\u2022 Allowing communities to determine local tax rates through referendums.</p> <p>\u2022 Allowing elected bodies freedom to borrow.</p> <p>\u2022 Giving communities the legal right to have failing services replaced.</p> <p>\u2022 Encouraging more use of community courts and restorative justice.</p> <p>\u2022 Allowing community-run organisations to take over services like children's centres.</p> <p>\u2022 Giving patients with long-term conditions, families with disabled children and people in training control over the budgets for their support.</p> <p>Milburn said neither Thatcherism nor Blairism \"moved power from the state to the individual or to the community\". He went on to claim that \"victory in the battle of ideas over the next decade will go to the party which can facilitate a paradigm shift in the relationship between state and citizen.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today, we reach the nadir of Moore's Xbox career \u2013 the Red Ring of Death scandal. Rumour has it, the controversy ended his tenure at Microsoft, but in the background there were other forces at play. Here's his definitive account...<br><br><strong>Nintendo got back into the market by reaching the demographics \u2013 the children and the women \u2013 that Microsoft had been unable to reach, because Xbox culture is still very much male-orientated\u2026 Why is that?</strong><br>Well, it all goes back to the original premise of what Microsoft felt that at that time they needed to do be successful \u2013 to even get into the conversation. And so to launch the Xbox it needed to be very clear that this was not going to be PC games ported over \u2013 Flight Sim, Age of Empires, things like that. They needed to win the hearts and minds of the hardcore gamers, and there's no better way to do that than with blood, guts and bullets. That was the idea \u2013 it was hardcore. </p> <p>And remember the ad in the UK \u2013 Champagne \u2013 which again was only shown once before it was banned, which was the baby being born, being catapulted through the air and ending up as the old guy in the grave\u2026 that set the tone. The theory was, rightly or wrongly, that if you win the hardcore gamer, then you can grow from the core \u2013 you can never go the other way. You hold your core but then you bring in the masses. But we were so good at what we did the first time around that it was difficult, then, to evolve.</p> <p><strong>And then Wii came along\u2026</strong><br>The GameCube had pretty much failed. I was in Tokyo when Iwata-san brought the controller out and said, 'here it is!' and we were all going, 'what the hell is that?''. I was with Robbie and I remember going 'I don't know\u2026 it's different'. But we knew that they were too good a company to lose twice in a row. But even then it was all about Sony, it was not about Nintendo, because they were so down and out \u2013 it's very difficult to think now, it was four years ago. You just couldn't picture that four or five years ago. GameCube was just\u2026 dying. The Revolution as it was called, we knew it couldn't be anything powerful. It was in the days when Sony and ourselves were saying it's all about hi-def, it's all about 5.1 sound, it's all about 1080i, and they said it's about a GameCube 1.5 and you're going to wave this stick around and have a lot of fun.</p> <p><strong>Is it strange to be the face of a corporation? Were you always aware of representing Microsoft or did you just say what you wanted to say?</strong><br>No, I never said what I <em>wanted</em> to say. Within whatever I say, there's a messaging framework, I might say it in a more flamboyant way but there's a messaging framework that I'm <em>usually</em> very careful to adhere to otherwise my handlers would roll over me. </p> <p>But there are times when, we probably\u2026 a year and a half ago we had a very difficult time with Xbox 360, with the hardware issues, and there are things that I've said that have been immortalized, and you try to say, well that's not what I meant\u2026 Infamously, a guy called Mike Antonucci of the San Jose Mercury news interviewed me and was really pushing hard, and of course when you're dealing with something as sensitive as defective hardware, you've got to be very careful what you say, not only about messaging but it's about legal issues. If you say things out of line on behalf of a company, you're exposing the company to lawsuits, people will take what you say and use it in a court of law - and Microsoft knows that very well. </p> <p>But I was focused at that time on trying to get customer service up and running to take care of some hardware problems, and I said, 'You know, things break', and then I was called Marie Antoinette \u2013 let them eat cake. But the context I was using wasn't flippant, the sentence was, 'things break, but our job is to go fix it for you'. So what I said was twisted to that it looked like I didn't care. </p> <p><strong>Do you think bloggers genuinely are representative of consumers? You're a blogger yourself now, for EA Sports\u2026</strong><br>The reason I blog is that I think our brand needs more of a conversation with its consumers. I think over the years we haven't evolved the brand \u2013 you know 'It's in the game' barked at you buy an American voice - it makes us who we are, but who we are has to evolve. I actually enjoy blogging, I like people, despite the ones that want to kill me. The idea of having this unique tool to speak to people and listen to people is appealing to me. It's dangerous, because one word out of place, particularly if you're prolific and you do it in a more casual style \u2013 it's not a polished press release that PR folks will read then wordsmith, it's just a lad from Liverpool who really can't type, just saying, this is what I think. But I'm still the president of the label, so even though it's just a blog, it's the official blog \u2013 what I say in there is indicative of what I think as the president of EA Sports. It's a fine line that you tread. </p> <p><strong>So how did EA come for you?</strong><br>John Riccitiello had taken a run at me before I went to Microsoft, and the night before I said yes to Robbie, John Riccitiello and the head of HR at that time had hauled me out for dinner to try to convince me to say no to Microsoft and to join EA \u2013 it was too late as I'd made a commitment to Robbie. Then Riccitiello came back and introduced the new label structure \u2013 I wouldn't have come to EA in the previous structure, it would make no sense. But my combination of sports experience with Reebok and Patrick and then obviously the ability to leverage that with my branding\u2026 and I love brands, and I love brands that are powerful, and linking the two \u2013 videogames and sports \u2013 together was an obvious attraction for me; as was getting back to the Bay area which I love.</p> <p>So it became a very emotional six weeks, because we've got to sell the house, I've got to tell Robbie, I've got to tell Bill Gates, I've got to tell Ballmer, Xbox is firing on all cylinders \u2013 and I just kept saying no, it's not going to work, and in the end Riccitiello to his credit really painted a compelling picture of where the company was going, what I could do \u2013 what I'd be <em>allowed</em> to do with EA Sports and I decided okay, I'm going to do it.</p> <p>It was unfortunate because as this was going on the Red Ring of Death story broke and so for better or worse the belief was that I'd been pushed out because of the hardware problems \u2013 that was not the case at all. But it was unfortunate timing. And then\u2026 I said yes in mid-June and still had E3 to get through, and in fairness to Microsoft I was already an EA employee while on stage with Rockband as head of Xbox \u2013 I wasn't an official EA employee, but I'd said yes to EA. Microsoft knew I was leaving and we made an agreement that my movement would be a material event to both companies, so we kept it all under wraps, didn't tell anybody. The only people who knew were Bill Gates, Robbie and Steve Ballmer at the Microsoft end. I did the press conference for Microsoft, I did three solid days of PR - the last interview was N'Gai Croal, he didn't know it then. The plan all along, which we'd worked with Microsoft and EA PR was to announce the following Monday \u2013 and that was kind of a bomb shell for Monday morning \u2013 I'm out of there. </p> <p>And I look back now \u2013 it's only ten months ago, it seems like a lifetime ago. It was a tough time, it was hard to leave, it always ends up being much more difficult than you ever thought it would be \u2013 because I knew, literally, a thousand people by name, I was the face of the platform, then all of a sudden I'm gone. And I felt bad because a) I didn't want people to think I was fired, because I wasn't and b) I didn't want my team there to think I was jumping ship because of the hardware problems, which I wasn't. It was for personal and family reasons and the fact that I really relished the opportunity to get back into the sports side of things and then be able to apply videogame experience\u2026 it was the only job, no other job would have tempted me.</p>",

  "<p>The Halifax owner <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbosbusiness\">HBOS</a></strong> - which has confirmed its \u00a312bn takeover by <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a></strong> - was not the only bank on the slide yesterday on credit crunch worries.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a></strong> was under the cosh yesterday, and today its shares are still in a volatile state. One of the bank's lawyers reportedly told a US bankruptcy court yesterday that it faced claims of between $1.5bn and $1.8bn against the collapsed <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a></strong>, in the form of an unsecured guarantee and trading losses. These are way down on the list of funds likely to be recovered.</p> <p>At the moment RBS is up 12.6p at 182p, having fallen as low as 161.4p earlier this morning.</p> <p>HBOS has climbed 36.9p to 184p after Lloyds offered 0.83 shares for each share in the mortgage bank. Lloyds has fallen 21p to 258.75p, valuing the offer at around 215p per HBOS share.</p> <p>Overall the market is still nervy, despite the news of the HBOS deal. Investors have realised the contagion has not finished spreading yet, with the prospect of more big financial names disappearing or being taken over. Morgan Stanley is said to be in merger talks with US regional banking group Wachovia, but other names mentioned as possible saviours for the US investment bank - HSBC and China's Citic - seem to be ruling themselves out. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a></strong> is up 5.25p to 806.25p.</p> <p>After falling to 4883.3, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is now 49.1 points higher at 4961.5. Traders were not sure how to react to news that the world's central banks - including the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve - would pump billions of dollars into the global money markets to ease a dollar funding squeeze. Either it was a good move which would help restore confidence, or it was a panicky measure which would have little effect.</p> <p>Simon Denham of Capital Spreads commented: \"Lloyds shotgun wedding with reluctant bride HBOS shows once again that the short sellers were correct, and that the protestations of solidity from the board, the FSA, and the Bank of England were straw in the wind. Who do we believe now? The authorities, who have claimed time and again, both here and across the pond that this bank or another is as safe as houses only for them to be proved wrong? Or the markets, who have searched out weakness wherever they can?</p> <p>\"Morgan Stanley is now in the sights of the pack, as anything even remotely weakened by current events seems fair game for the predators. The problem is that as soon as the whispers and rumours begin, the afflicted bank finds it impossible to rollover inter-bank loans, as counterparties insist on repayment. Any normal bank will have billions of dollars/pounds requiring rollover each and every day, and not only this, but many longer term loans can have early redemption if requested by the lender. </p> <p>\"Money desks quickly become swamped with withdrawal requests and are unable to replace the hole in the finances quickly enough to 'flatten' their books. Even banks must have matched books at the end of each and every business day. For every pound out in loans they must have a pound of deposit. So Morgan Stanley is now rumoured to be in talks with Wachovia and several other major banks, and it must now be feared that yet another investment bank will go the way of Merrill.\" </p> <p>Away from the immediate credit crunch, DIY group <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/kingfisher\">Kingfisher</a></strong> is up 10.2p at 130p after better than expected first half profits, and plans to cut costs to cope with the present difficult trading environment. </p> <p>Kaupthing analysts said there was \"some scope to reduce the debt for example via a disposal of [Germany subsidiary] Hornbach, and working capital control.

  "<p>FBI investigators are examining an email account belonging to the vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, after hackers broke into it and posted contents on the internet.</p> <p>Screenshots and photographs taken from the account \u2014 which was hosted by Yahoo \u2014 were put online yesterday after being sent to the whistleblowing website Wikileaks. </p> <p>The images showed a sequence of messages between Palin \u2014 the governor of Alaska and surprise choice as Republican vice-presidential nominee \u2014 and her state government aides, as well as a draft letter to the California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p> <p>Although some of the emails \u2014 from the address gov.palin@yahoo.com \u2014 appeared to be private, Wikileaks defended its decision by saying that Palin was violating standards on keeping public records by sending official emails through a private account.</p> <p>\"Governor Palin has come under criticism for using private email accounts to conduct government business and in the process avoid transparency laws,\" the website said. \"The list of correspondence, together with the account name, appears to reinforce the criticism.\"</p> <p>The hack has been attributed to an activist group known as Anonymous, a loose grouping of internet pranksters, vigilantes and anarchists that has previously locked horns with scientologists and internet paedophiles.</p> <p>Federal investigators are believed to be examining details of the hack to determine the identities of those responsible \u2014 though forensic experts have said this could take some time. Last night the Wikileaks website appeared to have gone down, though the reason was unclear. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Republican presidential campaign said the attack was invasive and unwarranted. \"This is a shocking invasion of the governor's privacy and a violation of law,\" said Rick Davis, the McCain-Palin campaign manager, in a statement. </p> <p>\"The matter has been turned over to the appropriate authorities and we hope that anyone in possession of these emails will destroy them. We will have no further comment.\"</p> <p>The use of non-government email services to conduct official business has been strongly criticised in the past. Official government communications are required to be preserved under federal law, but without using official communications channels, it remains unclear whether emails from private accounts are being correctly preserved.</p> <p>Last year the issue came to the fore after it emerged that the Bush administration had been using private accounts to conduct White House business.</p> <p>Some senior Bush advisers \u2014 including the former political strategist Karl Rove \u2014 had used private accounts, contrary to accepted practice. Documentation lost as a result included email conversations discussing the controversial dismissal of a number of United States attorneys, which critics claim was done because they were unsympathetic to the Republican cause.</p> <p>The attack by Anonymous is also reported to have stemmed from recent speculation about Palin's decision to fire the Alaska public safety commissioner in July. An independent investigation is under way to examine allegations that she governor sacked Walter Monegan because of his refusal to dismiss a state trooper, Mike Wooten \u2014 who was locked in a custody battle with Palin's sister at the time. </p> <p>\"Where you've got a governor apparently using a Yahoo account for state business, that's kind of a complete inversion of what ought to be happening in terms of public records,\" Charles Davis, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition, told the Anchorage Daily News this week.</p>",
  "<p>Police in China arrested 12 more people today as investigations continue into a milk powder scandal that has killed three babies.</p> <p>More than 6,000 infants in the country have been taken ill since being fed batches of contaminated milk formula last week. Local officials knew about the problem for more than a month before they alerted central authorities, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>So far, 18 suspects have been arrested in connection with the health scare, while a further 87 people have been summoned for questioning.</p> <p>News of the contamination first began with reports that dozens of babies in Gansu province had developed kidney stones after drinking a milk formula that contained melamine, a chemical normally used in plastics. </p> <p>Officials said that subsequent tests found affected batches at 22 of China's 109 milk powder manufacturers, including its two biggest dairies, Mengniu and Yili Industrial Group.</p> <p>The number of affected infants has soared. The health minister, Chen Zhu, said that 6,244 babies had fallen ill, 1,327 were in hospital and 158 were suffering from acute kidney failure. He expected the number of cases to rise.</p> <p>Chen said that so far all the sick infants had consumed milk powder made by the Sanlu group, the country's biggest formula producer. Li Changjiang, the head of China's quality control agency, said that 5,000 inspectors would monitor companies and all dairy products would be tested for melamine.</p> <p>The chemical is banned from use in food, but adding it to watered-down milk makes the liquid appear higher in protein when tested.</p> <p>China has sought to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scares. In 2004, more than 200 infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed formula containing no nutrients, and an estimated 1,500 dogs and cats died in the US last year after they consumed a melamine-tainted pet food ingredient manufactured in China.</p> <p>The Sanlu case is particularly alarming because the recall took so long, and apparently required the intervention of the New Zealand government, which was alerted by Sanlu's New Zealand-based partner Fonterra. New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, said on Monday that she ordered her officials to leapfrog regional authorities and inform Beijing directly.</p> <p>Today, Shi Guizhong, a spokesman for the Hebei provincial police, said government officials were starting a 10-day campaign to focus on the melamine contamination. </p> <p>Officers had also confiscated 300kg (660lb) of suspected chemicals, including 490 pounds of melamine, he said. </p> <p>One suspect, surnamed Su, told police that from February 2007 to July 2008 he bought 200 20kg sacks of melamine, and sold them all to milk suppliers, Shi told a news conference.</p> <p>Yang Chongyong, the deputy governor of Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, said the firm received customer complaints from March. But it was not until August 2 that it informed the city government of Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. Officials there waited more than a month, until September 9, to inform their bosses in the provincial government. </p> <p>The Hebei authorities took the problem to central government the following day. Sanlu finally ordered a recall.</p> <p>Andrew Ferrier, the chief executive of Fonterra, which owns 43% of Sanlu, said it had urged disclosure \"from day one\".</p> <p>The state news agency Xinhua reported that the mayor and four other city officials of Shijiazhuang had been fired. Sanlu's general manager, Tian Wenhua, was arrested. Four milk suppliers have been arrested and 22 detained.</p> <p>China is the world's second largest market for infant formula. Ding Bing, the China coordinator for the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, said: \"The milk powder companies do advertisements which exaggerate the effects of their products and make the mothers doubt [the quality of] their own milk.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Additional research by Chen Shi</p>",

  "<p>To lose one prime minister may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two in one year looks like carelessness. That paraphrase of Oscar Wilde aptly sums up the current state of Japanese politics, given the serial resignations of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6990967.stm\">Shinzo Abe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja-ZZoWEe-k&amp;eurl=http://news.google.com/news?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=resign%20shinzo&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;sa=Niurl=http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Ja-ZZoWEe-k/default.jpg\">Yasuo Fukuda</a>. </p> <p>Japan is once again saddled with a caretaker government as the ruling Liberal Democrat party (LDP) scrambles for a new leader with an election to the lower house of the Diet looming. The question is: who or what has been careless? The LDP? The constitution? The voters? </p> <p>For the last two years, the ruling LDP-Komei party coalition has dominated the powerful Lower House with a two-thirds majority. For a year, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and other mini-parties has controlled the Upper House, which can veto legislation. Political instability and gridlock have been the inevitable result. The problem is that another election won't fix this political mess, but will likely only ensure continuing paralysis. Japan's political system requires the same sort of structural reform that its economy has long needed. And, as with the economy, its politicians don't appear ready to deliver anything that daring. </p> <p>The LDP and the DPJ are now debating how to manage rising inflation at a time of falling living standards and deepening economic polarisation within society \u2013 the latter a legacy of former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's market-oriented reforms of 2001-2005. The debate is centred on whether to increase the consumption tax in order to sustain the country's severely strained social security system. Only occasionally does the issue of administrative and governmental reform sneak to the centre of policy debates. </p> <p>The LDP has tried to placate public wrath about a series of political scandals and policy mistakes over the last two years, while the DPJ has attempted to capitalise on these. </p> <p>The LDP is now staging a party leadership election in the hope of gaining a temporary boost in popular support before the Lower House election. The five contenders, all of whom served in Koizumi's cabinet, are actively debating major policy issues, but appear to be offering only more of the similar, because they are not equipped with Koizumi's charisma and boldness. </p> <p>The frontrunner is <a href=\"http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/hq/profile/aso.html\">Taro Aso</a>, the LDP secretary general, who wants economic pump-priming. One of his major challengers is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuriko_Koike\">Yuriko Koike</a>, Japan's first female defense minister, who is committed to restarting Koizumi's market-oriented reforms and has his backing. The other three have some charm and ability, but have offered nothing like a remedy to Japan's deep structural problems, mostly because they all have not made tackling these problems their priority. </p> <p>Given Japan's huge accumulated national debts, the LDP can no longer appease the electorate through pork-barrel spending. In essence, Koizumi's reforms effectively dismantled the LDP's vote-getting machine, which relied on buying off vested interests. </p> <p>One consequence of this is that most Japanese voters nowadays are swing voters with no party loyalty. The maverick Koizumi had the personal attractiveness and ideological appeal needed to galvanise a majority behind his plans for a \"fair\" distribution of the pain of reform. His charisma dissipated public resistance, as his battle cry \u2013 \"Demolish the LDP\" \u2013 seemed to promise that politicians would also pay a price for change. </p> <p>Koizumi did, of course, revive Japan's economy after a decade of stagnation. Yet even he did not touch the economy's gargantuan quasi-governmental sector \u2013 the source of the most horrendous waste and misspending. The public blames the LDP's inability to control the bureaucracy, if not its complicity with it. Yet the LDP's position is not hopeless, because the public remains highly skeptical that the amateurish DPJ can control the bureaucracy, either. </p> <p>So Japan's choice comes down to one between a distrusted LDP and an incompetent DPJ. Given voters' vacillation, neither the LDP nor the DPJ is likely to gain an absolute majority. Should the LDP win a simple majority, the new administration would still face a hung Diet, owing to the DPJ's control of the Upper House. So any new LDP-led coalition government will be just as precarious as the last two pathetic administrations. </p> <p>Conversely, should the DPJ gain a simple majority, its inexperienced government will immediately have to cope with the same intractable policy issues that the LDP failed to confront. Should the DPJ gain a plurality and forge a coalition with the country's far-left parties, the outcome would be ceaseless instability. </p> <p>The core of Japan's political inertia consists in the current pseudo-two-party system comprising the LDP and the DPJ, because the parties' divisions are actually devoid of any consistent ideological and policy differences. Both parties include conservatives and liberals, defense hawks and doves. The DPJ's president, Ichiro Ozawa, who once served as an LDP secretary general, is exemplar of this confused legacy. </p> <p>Sadly, the chances that the LDP will reform, or that the DPJ will evolve into a responsible party of government in the foreseeable future, are slim. Japan seems condemned to endure chronic and pointless political trench warfare until some crisis forces a realignment of political parties along ideological and policy lines. </p> <p>Only when that happens will Japan be ready to play the responsible international leadership role that the world's second largest economy should play. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
