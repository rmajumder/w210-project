  "<p>Can Israel be criticised? Jewish American academic Norman Finkelstein, author of The Holocaust Industry, argues that legitimate criticism of Israeli policy is possible, although, as he discovered, it may mean losing your job and being labelled a \"Jewish anti-Semite\". Finkelstein rejects the view that the Israel-Palestine conflict is impossibly complex as a mystification, insists that the Palestinians were ethnically cleansed in 1948, and exposes Israel's damning human rights record. But most of all Beyond Chutzpah is a sustained attack on Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz's bestselling The Case for Israel, which Finkelstein calls one of \"the most spectacular academic frauds ever published on the Israel-Palestine conflict\". First published in 2005, this revised edition has a lengthy preface detailing the book's reception, while an epilogue by Frank J Menetrez concludes that Dershowitz destroyed Finkelstein's career. It's an academic spat of epic proportions, but while Finkelstein wins the moral argument, his combative tone, born of exasperation, is unlikely to calm the debate.</p>",
  "<p>Putrid, smelly, overcrowded Victorian Lambeth; the Necropolitan railway rumbling away in the background; prestigious bookbinding business under threat from tyrannical husband's arthritic fingers; angelic girl child's epilepsy getting worse; debt-collectors breathing down her neck - it seems it's the workhouse or the whorehouse for Dora Damage. Luckily, she's a thoroughly modern, feisty sort and, despite being a woman, takes responsibility for the family business upon herself. Thus begins a Dickensian web of intrigue and lies involving black ex-slaves with workmanship to die for, erotic books with descriptions that would make your eyes water, ex-working girls with hearts of gold and sex-slave parties for Victorian nobility. All the elements are there to make Belinda Starling's posthumously published debut an entertaining addition to the trend for Victorian-era literature. But for me her London never came to life, her feminist message was delivered as subtly as a whip at an orgy and the narrative confused without gripping.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter from America No 2571, May 22 1998 </strong></p> <p>It's not hard to imagine as the theme of a James Bond movie that a man acquires the power to control the internet worldwide. He could, before long, control the world's economies, knowledge, food, transport, all the services that more and more will be done over the internet.</p> <p>Well, such a monster is inconceivable in life, but the United States government is acting as if the lives of nations, as well as you and me, would be disturbingly affected if one man controlled everybody's access to the internet. </p> <p>This week the government - the cavalry division, namely the department of justice - came down like a wolf on the fold of one famous young man way off there in Seattle, on the Pacific coast, in the far west. The name of the case on the docket is USA v Microsoft Corp. Riding alongside were the supporting troops of 20 states, each bringing its own charge, against Mr Bill Gates's corporation, of monopoly.</p> <p>Mr Gates is 42 years old, has a baby face and large wire-framed glasses (don't let them fool you), and, it is generally admitted, is a genius of an innovator with computers to whom millions owe their livelihood. He is the king of software manufacturers; some say the dictator. One of his struggling competitors said he is \"the most dangerous and powerful industrialist of our age\". </p> <p>At Mr Gates's Senate hearing, there were several heads of rival computer companies present, very angry men I can tell you. When Mr Gates was disputing the use of the word \"monopoly\", one of them swivelled round and put a question to the astonished audience at the hearing, \"How many people own personal computers?\" About three-quarters of those present. \"How many have a computer that's not fitted with Microsoft's Explorer?\" Not a hand raised. \"That,\" shouted the rival, \"is a monopoly.\"</p> <p>... The last big business monopoly case that the government brought spent 17 years in the courts before an outside settlement was reached. So, don't expect this mighty case to be done with tomorrow, next week, or even perhaps by 2100. If you're around then, please tell me the result in an email, sent to Cooke. Dot com. Valhalla.</p>",
  "<p>I sported a series of eye-catching hairstyles at university, including electric-blue dreadlocks. But I went back to being a natural brunette before graduation, in case potential employers thought I would clash with more than just the office colour scheme.</p> <p>Other graduates aren't so keen to conform. Further education art lecturer Faye-Michelle Turner has a pierced nose and lip, and tattoos on her wrist and forearm. \"I've always gone to interviews with my piercings in,\" says Turner, who completed her teacher training at the University of Plymouth. \"I don't want to work for someone who won't employ me because of them. I've been asked to take them out in interviews before and haven't got the job after saying no.\"</p> <p>Don't assume it's illegal for employers to reject you on these grounds. Joan Pettingill, an employment partner at commercial law firm HLW, says discrimination law applies to matters concerning your sex, race, nationality, religion or belief and sexual orientation, but not your fashion sense.<br>\"If an employer turns you down because of a piercing you have for reasons to do with religion and belief, that may not be something the law would allow,\" says Pettingill. \"But the general rule is you can ensure people look satisfactory for business requirements, subject to anti-discrimination legislation. You can't ask someone about their religious background at interview stage, so employers have to make reasonably informed judgments.\"</p> <p>Turner says her appearance helps her relate to her students. \"Looking young and funky helps me build a relationship with them,\" she explains. \"I did feel I had to ease into it, because I'm a new professional and people I work with may not be so accepting. I wore smaller studs and covered my tattoos when I started teaching, but I got more funky looking as time went by.\"</p> <p>It's not just arts-based roles where body decoration may be acceptable. Bryony Beynon is a business-to-business technology consultant at Rainier PR. She has tattoos on her arms, back and feet, as well as a pierced top lip and nasal septum.</p> <p>\"I sing in a punk band, the Sceptres, so how I look is quite personality-critical,\" says Beynon, who studied English and cultural studies at the University of Sussex. \"I had a punk haircut and I let that grow out, but I think if you can't present yourself as someone with a personality, that's not good.\"</p> <p>That said, Beynon dresses more conservatively for interviews. \"First impressions are important, so it's worth toning it down,\" she advises. \"I always wore long sleeves to cover my tattoos, but mentioned them to test the water if I was getting on well with an interviewer.\"</p> <p>Hayley Gullen graduated from Cambridge University in 2006 with a degree in Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. While working as a street fundraiser for the charity Greenpeace, she put her hair in dreadlocks to match her boss.<br>\"It was my work that persuaded me to do it,\" says Gullen, who now works in business development. \"But I got rid of them when I quit because I didn't want to limit my chances. I did see that people viewed me differently when I had them.\"</p> <p>According to Sarah Evans, a director at graduate recruitment service Discovery Recruitment and Training, it's important to understand that you'll be representing your employer. \"You're being paid to reflect their values and culture, potentially in front of other businesses looking to buy their services,\" she explains. \"That's why some companies are quite particular about personal appearance.\"</p> <p>\"First impressions count,\" agrees Ruth Stokes, head of recruitment at accounting firm KPMG. \"We expect our people to look professional. We would hope applicants recognise what is appropriate and are prepared to adapt accordingly.\"</p> <p>Nick Ridout joined broadcasting company Sky's technical graduate scheme after studying economics and politics at the University of Manchester. He has two lip piercings and wears see-through studs at work so they won't heal over. \"They're not noticeable unless I point them out,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I play in a metal band called Zangryus, and they help in terms of stage presence and the band's overall look,\" says Ridout. \"I think you can never be too smart for interviews, so I take them out to give myself the best shot.\"<br>Helen Williamson manages graduate recruitment at Sky and believes it's short-sighted to judge by appearance. \"It's a rare employer now that can afford to miss out on talent,\" she says. \"For me, it doesn't make a positive or negative impression at interview stage.\"</p> <p>Sky abolished its dress code six months ago. \"We used to have guidelines, but we got rid of them,\" says Williamson. \"We want people to enjoy working here, and the freedom to choose how you look at work is part of that.\"<br>Graduate recruitment adviser Evans says it's important to understand why some employers don't share this outlook. \"Think about it from the company's point of view,\" she says. \"They're not trying to stifle your individuality, but the way you represent yourself affects how you represent them. Once you get a feel for a company's culture, then you can see what's appropriate.\"<br>One graduate who changed her appearance to maximise her employment prospects is Jane Bradley. Now an account executive at JBA Public Relations, she stopped dying her hair bright red after being made redundant due to the credit crunch.</p> <p>\"I didn't want to shut any doors,\" says the Leeds graduate, who studied creative writing with English literature and has eight piercings, including a tongue stud. \"Being able to display your personality is important, but I didn't want to exclude myself from anything.</p> <p>\"I take my tongue piercing out for interviews because I don't mind doing that every day. It's integral to my identity, but it's not the end of the world if I can only wear it after half past five.\"</p>",
  "<h2>I have the will, but is there a way to become a probate researcher?</h2> <p><strong>I'm a history graduate, considering options for my next career move. Having watched BBC1's Heir Hunters, I'm really interested in becoming a probate researcher but have no idea how I might get into this line of work. I contacted some firms but they all say that most of their staff are ex-police. Can you tell me if it is possible to pursue this career with my academic background?</strong></p> <p>The programme you mention sparked huge interest in careers in probate research but opportunities are very limited. There are only a handful of companies who specialise in tracing missing heirs or the heirs of people who died intestate; they generally work against the clock competing with<br>others to find missing relatives. It's an expensive business with uncertain returns. However, if you're determined and persistent its still possible to get in as a trainee. The largest company, Fraser Fraser (<a href=\"http://www.fraserandfraser.com\">fraserandfraser.com</a>) employs 50 people and recruits up to three trainees a year. Neil Fraser says he looks for candidates with a good knowledge of history and geography plus lots of common sense. He's not keen on genealogical research qualifications as the company prefers to provide its own training. Frasers has taken graduates in the past but is now targeting those with A-levels as it found graduates became frustrated by the lack of promotion opportunities. So your background is fine but you would need to convince a potential employer that you'd be content with a junior role.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about the subject for its own sake, the Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies and the Society of Genealogists offers a range of courses, as do the Universities of Central Lancaster, Strathclyde and Dundee. Genealogists can do similar work to probate researchers but in different contexts. The Association of Genealogists and Researchers (<a href=\"http://www.agra.org.uk\">www.agra.org.uk</a>) represents those who charge a fee for such services. Full members have to demonstrate competence and experience but there is an affiliate scheme to encourage those thinking about starting up.</p> <h2>Is it worth applying for a job if it has not been advertised?</h2> <p><strong>The feedback from my job applications has been that I was one of many strong candidates. Would I have more chance with speculative applications?</strong></p> <p>A well-crafted letter to an employer you've researched thoroughly can be extremely effective. They may not have a vacancy right now but if you make a strong impression they will remember you. Make sure the emphasis is on what you can do for them, rather than what they can do for you. Make each recipient feel you understand their business and can contribute to it.</p>",
  "<p>Monday sees the launch of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week, an awareness drive fronted by BBC TV presenter Adrian Chiles aimed at helping people protect themselves against one of the UK's fastest-growing crimes.</p> <p>But just how scared should we be that our personal information will be used by someone else to fraudulently obtain credit, goods or other services? Is ID fraud really such a massively growing danger?</p> <p>Research by American Express in July showed that it has apparently overtaken being mugged or attacked as the nations top safety fear.</p> <p>In fact, the number of ID fraud cases has actually gone down over the past couple of years. According to figures from the UK's fraud prevention service Cifas, there were 65,043 victims in 2007 down from 67,406 in 2006. That's a 3.5% decrease. And in the first half of this year the trend has continued, with 28,500 ID fraud victims filed by Cifas members for January to June 2008 compared with 33,466 in the same period last year.</p> <p>A Cifas spokesperson says: No one should be complacent, as the number of victims is still far too high.</p> <p>Fair comment. While panicking is, perhaps, a waste of energy, denying that any problem exists and being careless with our personal data is foolhardy. There is plenty of advice available on the best ways to protect yourself. This includes a new website <a href=\"http://stop-idfraud.co.uk\">stop-idfraud.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>You can download a guide to protecting your identity and find out how at risk you are.</p> <p>Top protection tips include:</p> <p>\u2022 Think twice before giving any personal details to callers, charity collectors or researchers in the street. Be just as careful with telephone calls.</p> <p>\u2022 Guard your credit and debit cards, and never write down or tell anyone your pin numbers. If you lose a card, report it immediately. If you apply for a new card and it doesn't arrive in a reasonable time, contact the issuer. Sign new cards in permanent ink and activate immediately.</p> <p>\u2022 Dispose of documents securely. Shred credit card and bank statements, receipts, letters from doctors and employers, and anything bearing your full name and address or signature.</p> <p>\u2022 Keep personal documents safely locked away at home. Burglars increasingly search for them rather than TVs and computers, says Cifas.</p> <p>\u2022 Check bank and credit card statements and query any unidentified transactions.</p> <p>\u2022 When buying online, keep passwords secure at all times and regularly change them. Make sure that you have Check your credit file regularly for unfamiliar items and take prompt action if you spot anything strange.</p> <p>\u2022 You may be tempted to buy identity theft insurance offered by many banks and other companies to help protect you. The cover, which isn't cheap, typically includes early-warning alerts to let people know of any credit applications have been made in their name and help towards the cost of clearing your name.</p> <p>\u2022 If you do become a victim try not to panic. Tell any organisations involved immediately, report the crime to the police and get a copy of your credit file. You will not normally be liable for debts accrued by a fraudster using your identity. But it is down to you, as the victim, to sort out the mess caused by them.</p>",
  "<p>Let me ask you a question: You hear that a poet is coming into your workplace next week. Do you a) Think, great, I can't wait! b) Think, hmmm, intriguing, I wonder how this will impact upon performance and job satisfaction? c) Nod wryly and arrange to take off days in lieu or, d) Resign and sue for constructive dismissal?</p> <p>Me? I'd tick a). I really would. But I can understand the c) and d) tickers. English poet Adrian Mitchell famously said, \"Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people.\" Which led another poet, John Hegley, to observe that most penguins ignore most putty for similar reasons. At best, most people's experience of poetry is of something dry and difficult, precious and twee. At worst it's akin to Vogon poetry from The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy brain-scrapingly dull dross forced on you by aliens.</p> <p>But I have a theory that gives me a warm, happy feeling. My theory is that most people like poetry. Really.</p> <p>A man approached me at a recent festival. I'd just come offstage and I thought he wanted to congratulate me or buy a book. He leaned in close, excited; he had something he really wanted to tell me. For a grim second I thought he was going to recite poetry. I steeled myself for a Vogon moment. No, he wanted me to know that a few month's ago he'd put a poem up on the board at work an unprecedented, unheard-of act. No one said anything, but no one took it down, and a few day's later someone put a poem up beside it. He took his down and put another up. People began to talk about the poems. More went up. In an office where no-one had previously mentioned the P-word, they created a cherished and jealously guarded Poetry Corner. He shook my hand as if I was personally responsible.</p> <p>It's clear to him, as it is to me, that poetry in the workplace is a good, good thing. But not the Vogon stuff. In my Poetry Writers' Yearbook, Hungarian poet Georges Szirtes points out that when someone does something wonderful, we often say, \"Sheer poetry!\" or \"Poetry in motion!\" The P-word is a compliment, except when it refers to its inky, wordy self. the same way they like some food. But they need to eat. We all do.</p> <p>Poetry's not life and death, of course. But it is quality of life and death. Soul food. If there are five portions of non-material nourishment we need in a day, poetry provides three of them. And where better to get your five portions than the workplace where, apparently, we spend more time than with our families.</p> <p>Thursday is National Poetry Day and the theme of this year's celebration is work. In workplaces up and down the country there'll be all kinds of cunning poetry stunts. A City law firm plans to hold a board meeting in which only verse will be spoken. HSBC will host a reading by a Kazakh poet at its Canary Wharf headquarters. Shop workers at the Co-op in Penzance will offer poems in a tin to customers.</p> <p>Seamus Heaney's Digging will be dusted down in schools and colleges, as will Philip Larkin's Toads: \"Why should I let the toad work/ Squat on my life?\" And its recanting sequel, Toads Revisited, which ends: \"Give me your arm, old toad;/ Help me down Cemetery Road.\" Maybe Marge Piercy's The Secretary Chant will get an airing too. Great poems. Good stuff.</p> <p>It's the one day in the year when poetry, and working poets like me, get invited through the front door. But if poetry is to infiltrate the workplace as I would like it to, it'll be through the eccentric, unilateral actions of people like the protagonist of John Osborne's Simon Armitage poem (see below) or my man at the festival. Or through the Poetry Trust putting up poster-poems in the loos and cafes of Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.</p> <p>However, its one thing to get poetry read in the workplace. Another to generate poems of the workplace. Where will the professional and trade poems come from?</p> <p>An excellent role model can be found in the form of cowboy poetry. You heard me right, stranger. And I laughed, too, first time. But it does what it says on the hide. It gets lonesome on the trail, and thinkin' and reflectin' leads to writin' and to rhymin'. The results are gritty, witty, crafty and grafty. Dont believe me? Go to <a href=\"http://cowboypoetry.com\">cowboypoetry.com</a> and click on a lariat laureate. But when will we find plumbers', doctors', builders' or IT technicians' poetry? The latter already exists in the form of haiku error messages that grace the viral cyber byways:</p> <p>\"Your file was so big./ It might be very useful./ But now it is gone.<br>A crash reduces/ Your expensive computer/ To a simple stone.\"</p> <p>Maybe along with the annual splash of National Poetry Day we could have a weekly local ripple. Some workplaces have a dress-down Friday. We could call it wordy Wednesday, or talky Tuesday.</p> <p>The other week our builder, Duncan, came in whistling a happy tune. \"It's my favourite day today\", he said. \"Poets day\". My ears pricked up. \"What does that involve? Bringing in a poem?\" \"No.\" \"Writing one?\" \"No\", he said, \"P.O.E.T. day. Piss off early today\".

  "<p>I'd never really given Jimmy Greaves's maxim, \"It's a funny ol' game\", the contemplation it deserved; foolishly, I'd taken it to be a kind of idiomatic twitch, an unconsidered exhalation merely filling time till Ian St John could up the gravitas with some furrow-browed analysis. On reflection, and from the vantage point of 2008, through my retrospect-ulars I see that it is a line worthy of Lao-Tse, for the game is indeed both funny ha ha and funny peculiar. Not to mention \"ol'\".</p> <p>I have already, necessarily, addressed the difficulty of communicating the preposterous complexities of this season's high farce to Americans - Saudi takeovers, Geordie messiahs, millionaire footballers hidden under blankets and \"Profanity\" Joe Kinnear. Now I must endeavour to comprehend the madness of Hull's victory and Sol Campbell's lyrical character assassination, but primarily Joe's (my brilliant \"Joke in 'ere\" nickname has not garnered the support I would've liked - I'd assumed it'd be the new X Factor or iPod) carnival of cursing is the most arresting of the week's events.</p> <p>The raw humanity of the cussing is what makes it interesting, Joe has truly stripped all subterfuge and mystery from communication - his press conference breakdown has exposed the tension at the heart of the relationship between the press and those who they write about. Naturally I shall be cautious as the incident has revealed Kinnear to be deeply confrontational and suggests he may be litigious - also I've had personal experience of media acrimony and know that it can be bloody annoying when the press coat you off, or misrepresent you or simply don't like you - but judging from the transcripts the journalists present were perfectly reasonable, unless their measured contributions were delivered in mocking, sarcastic voices...</p> <p><strong>Journalist</strong> Have you read the copy? It doesn't say the players won't turn up.</p> <p><strong>JK</strong> You're a cunt ... also you're doing a cruel \"mong\" voice. Pack it in.</p> <p>Obviously I'm paraphrasing and the idea that the reporters present were doing silly voices is pure conjecture. What this press conference and Kinnear's agitation reveal is that he failed to anticipate the kind of environment he was going into. He can't have thought that managing Newcastle for a brief period at a time of crisis when the fans are demanding either Christ, Shearer or Keegan would be the footballing equivalent of a Chas &amp; Dave record; surely he must've expected scrutiny and pressure? </p> <p>I identify with the craving to lash out at journalists, though. Just yesterday some snooty prig was straining out weak humour in a telephone interview I'd agreed to and I thought, 'Why am I tolerating this when I could simply find out their place of residence and dash out their brain with an onyx lamp?' But that would achieve nothing.</p> <p>Kinnear's authenticity in this instance is comparable to Kevin Keegan's famous \"I'd love it\" moment where he, brimming with passion and indignation, allowed Alex Ferguson to psychologically topple his side from the Premiership summit. But this occurred at a time when he was already treasured; Kinnear only turned up a week ago. It's like finding out that, against your wishes, a lodger is moving in, then learning on the first night that he's a flatulent drunk who won't let anyone else use the remote control.</p> <p>After a good 20 minutes of what must've been a very difficult situation a Newcastle press officer tried to salvage something by insisting that they \"talk football\", but by then the damage had been done and the pungent stink of swearwords and conflict must've been stifling - only a lapdance, a firework or a spontaneous romance could've rescued the situation and what was offered instead was the question: \"How's training going?\"</p> <p>I had car journeys like that as a child - after monumental tiffs with loathed step-parents some cove would try and resurrect the atmosphere with a pleasantry. But there's little that can be done. What I would dispute is Kinnear's insistence that Newcastle United are disliked. I think people feel great affection for Newcastle, accepting that they have special significance in the hearts of their fans and generally wishing them well.</p> <p>I think the same is true of Kinnear: people don't dislike him, it's just the situation seems a bit daft. If you're reading this Joe, heed Greavsie's wisdom and lighten up. And don't Google yourself for a while.</p>",
  "<p>Benny Sithole can be forgiven for thinking himself unlucky. Four years ago, he left his home in southern Mozambique with the clothes on his back and the cellphone number of a childhood friend in his pocket. He was heading for Johannesburg, South Africa, to find work and money. Within two years, he had created a stable business - a fruit and vegetable stall just a few hundred yards from the shack he had made his home. It was a modest enterprise, but he was earning enough to support a mother and two sisters back home. He had also married a South African woman, a Xhosa-speaker named Kate Ntsaluba, and had a wide circle of South African friends.</p> <p>On the afternoon of May 18 2008, some of Sithole's neighbours, among them young men he'd known quite well, drove from their homes him and his wife and every other foreign national in the settlement. After the couple had gone, the invaders looted their shack, distributing its furniture among themselves. Next, they tore down Sithole's fruit and vegetable stall to use for firewood.</p> <p>\"I received no warning,\" Sithole said. \"On the Saturday night, they were the same people they had been since the day I met them. By the time the sun set on Sunday, they had told me I must either leave or die.\" Neither Sithole nor his wife has returned, he for fear of being killed because he is foreign, she because she suspects she will be raped for sharing her bed with a Mozambican.</p> <p>Benny and Kate Sithole are among the tens of thousands of victims of a pogrom, the first to take place in Nelson Mandela's rainbow nation. Several million foreign nationals have poured across South Africa's borders since the end of apartheid, most of them illegally. They have received a mixed welcome from ordinary South Africans and state officials alike. This May, South Africans in shantytowns across the country decided to throw them out.</p> <p>Exactly a week before the Sitholes fled their home, trouble had begun 30 or so miles away in Alexandra, a densely populated township in northern Johannesburg. At the time, it seemed to have come from nowhere. On the afternoon of May 11, a crowd of South Africans gathered on the outskirts of the township and attacked the occupants of an abandoned factory said to be inhabited primarily by Zimbabweans. By the following morning, the crowd had grown and was moving through Alexandra's shack settlements, driving foreigners from their homes, looting some and burning others.</p> <p>During the next few days, the violence spread from Alexandra as if by contagion. The following week there was looting and killing in shantytowns as far away as Durban and Cape Town. Three weeks after it began, it was all but over, having been doused by the army and police, who made more than 1,000 arrests. More than 60 people were dead, and tens of thousands had had to flee their homes.</p> <p>Few South Africans would deny that what happened is both a catastrophe and turning point in their country's history. Mandela's South Africa was not long ago the world's most celebrated young democracy. Johannesburg's inner-city neighbourhoods were among the most cosmopolitan places on the continent. Many dreamed that it was on these streets that a new African identity might emerge. At the very least, the May riots herald the end of a young nation's innocence.</p> <p>For the violence takes its place in a long sequence of bad news. The ruling ANC, long considered the most sober and unflappable of Africa's liberation movements, seems in recent times to have drifted from its moorings. Over the past two years, it has been roiled by the bitterest and most unseemly of conflicts between rival factions. Now, little more than four months after the riots, the battle for power has reached a dramatic climax; South African President Thabo Mbeki has resigned after a palace coup in his own party. His probable successor, Jacob Zuma, is a wild card, a populist figure whose supporters have launched ominous and cynical attacks on the judiciary in an attempt to scupper an impending corruption trial against him. The party is turning into a new creature, one that is as yet unknowable.</p> <p>And so there is trouble among South Africa's elite and in its shantytowns. It is tempting to draw a comparison between the two. The chilling acquisitiveness with which mobs have looted and burned the homes of foreigners bears comparison with the thuggery and naked hunger for power recently displayed in the ranks of the ruling party. Some of Zuma's supporters have threatened to kill those who would obstruct their man's ascendancy. And the battle within the ANC has had other destructive results. South Africa has faced one crisis after another. Serial electricity blackouts hit much of the country this January. It emerged that poor government planning had left the country short of power for years to come, handicapping future investment in mining and manufacturing, a dire prospect for a country desperate to get the unemployed into work.</p> <p>This was the backdrop to the attacks that began in Alexandra on May 11. There hasn't been a nationwide outbreak of social unrest like it since the dying days of apartheid. South Africa's defeated former president has himself been prone to talk in apocalyptic terms of the cost of failing to deliver on the South African dream. Mbeki is fond of misquoting a poem by Langston Hughes: \"What happens to a dream deferred?\" he has asked. \"It explodes.\"</p> <p>In South Africa it is the season to denounce Mbeki, and many have blamed him for the xenophobic riots. He is gone now, but the makings of a conflict, more far-reaching than the one we saw in May, remain.</p> <p>The decisions Benny Sithole made during the first days of trouble could have cost him his life. He listens avidly to radio news, so he knew by the morning of May 13 that thousands of foreigners were fleeing Alexandra. Yet as the violence spread to within striking distance of his own home, he had no thoughts of moving. \"I just didn't believe it was possible,\" he said. \"Four years is a long time to live in one place. You are settled. You know many people by name. Maybe in other places, I thought. But not here.\"</p> <p>The Sitholes lived in Ramaphosa, a shantytown of some 30,000 people about 20 miles from Johannesburg - in an area called Dark City, the last part of the settlement to remain unelectrified. Like dozens of other settlements around Johannesburg, it emerged overnight, when recent immigrants erected shacks on municipal land. Over the years, the government has steadily provided it with one service after another, first water, then electricity, then several hundred brick-and-mortar houses. A cross-section of southern Africa lived there: South Africans from all over the country with their many languages, Zimbabweans, Mozambicans, Malawians, small minorities of Angolans and Congolese. All are first-generation Johannesburgers, and almost none regards the city as home.</p> <p>\"The trouble started far from Dark City,\" Sithole said, \"in the centre of Ramaphosa, where the non-South Africans have set up rows and rows of stalls. They sell everything from vegetables to live chickens. A group of young men came to steal the chickens, knock over the vegetables and kick the stalls down.\" The next day, the crowd worked its way through Ramaphosa, gathering numbers as it moved. By the Sunday morning, the crowd was close enough for Sithole to hear them. Those who had gathered to loot and kill were singing freedom songs composed during the struggle against apartheid. Only now, they no longer sang of white minority rule, but of foreigners, and of the jobs, houses and women the foreigners had stolen.</p> <p>\"With the singing in our ears,\" Sithole said, \"something happened. The young unemployed South African men of Dark City - people I know very well, people who sit and play dice all day long - started to take things from our stalls. They took handfuls of tomatoes and cabbages. Some of the older people came and called the younger ones to task, then went back to playing dice.</p> <p>\"There is this committee in Dark City. It is composed of the South Africans who live among us. It called an emergency meeting; the idea was to form a defence unit to keep the crowd away from our homes. But halfway through the meeting, the committee changed its mind. It decided, no, we are not going to stop them. Some South African neighbours came to me and said, 'You must go. If you stay, you will die.'</p> <p>\"I ran to the shack of a South African friend at the other side of Dark City,\" Sithole continued. \"He has been a customer of mine every day for four years. He let me in. I phoned my wife. She was out working. I told her not to come home. My friend sheltered me for four days and nights. I did not dare to come out in case I was recognised. I must have been the last Mozambican left in the whole of Ramaphosa.</p> <p>\"On the fifth night, my host came to me looking upset. He said, 'Listen, this place is not the same, it is run by thugs now, and there is talk that I am hiding foreigners. You must go.' \"</p> <p>Sithole stole out of Ramaphosa at 2am the following morning the same way he had arrived - with the clothes on his back. When we met, he was living in the back of a truck with several other refugees outside Reiger Park police station, less than a mile from Dark City. \"My South African customers have come out of Ramaphosa one by one to pay their respects to me,\" he said. \"They tell me they are so embarrassed by what has happened.\"</p> <p>Sithole is adamant he will stay in South Africa. \"My wife is here. I will not find work in Mozambique. There are plenty of places here in Johannesburg where the foreigners are still accepted. I have friends from home in Soweto. Things are peaceful there. It is not yet time for us to run.\"</p> <p>Sithole is right. South Africa's several million foreign nationals have not been expelled, and most of urban South Africa remained quiet during the two weeks of trouble. There were rumblings for a night or two in parts of Soweto, but the violence did not explode there. In the massive shack settlement of Diepsloot, west of Johannesburg, the trouble lasted one night. The next day, the local branch of the ANC began a campaign charmingly dubbed Shit On The Criminals. Looted property was confiscated and several dozen young men arrested. Ramaphosa is among the few places to which foreign nationals have been unable return to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>And yet, looking at the origins of the violence and how it spread, the question remains - when and in what form will it come back, and who will be the target next time?</p> <p>Alexandra township, where the violence began, occupies little more than a square mile of northern Johannesburg. Built to accommodate 60,000 people, it is now home to about 400,000. Those who flock there have laid claim to every conceivable space. What were once the playing fields of a local high school are now occupied by 1,200 shacks. The backyards of houses in the heart of the original township are lined with tin shacks: some tenants pay rent to the family in the main house; some don't.</p> <p>Were the troubles simply a case of a vastly overpopulated place finally snapping? It is not as simple as that. There was forewarning of the violence. It was advocated in public forums in the days before it began. \"It happened in the middle of our regular weekly forum at the police station on May 6,\" said Thomas Sithole (no relation to Benny), chairman of the Alexandra Community Policing Forum. South Africa's constitution mandates every police station commander to establish such a forum to consult with the civilians in his jurisdiction. \"Out of nowhere, the representative from the Beirut section of the township stood up and said that the people in his area were sick and tired of crime, and that the police were doing nothing about it. He said they were ready to gather arms and retaliate. Then, four days later, on the Saturday, a meeting of the residents' association in that area was held at a church on Third Avenue. It ended with a resolution to chase out the foreigners. The violence began, in that sector, the following day.\"</p> <p>The area has been dubbed \"Beirut\" because it is no stranger to urban warfare. In 1996, conflict in Alexandra erupted between the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the ANC in the run-up to municipal government elections. Zulu-speaking IFP supporters were chased from their homes and resettled in Beirut. Non-Zulu speakers fled Beirut. That the area is Zulu is largely a result of violence.</p> <p>The troubles of this May were concentrated in Beirut. When foreign nationals began returning to Alexandra after the violence subsided, those whose homes were outside Beirut went back to their original shacks. Those from Beirut did not. Non-Zulu-speaking South Africans in Beirut reportedly lost their homes, too. Joe Sikwale, a veteran civic leader in Alexandra, told us, \"The Venda speakers who were chased away were told their homeland is so close to Zimbabwe that they are not South Africans. Shangaans were told that, because they share the same language as Mozambicans, they must run away with their Mozambican brothers.\"</p> <p>Local party politics may be at the root of the violence. The IFP once controlled the municipal ward that incorporates Beirut. It lost it in 2006, when ward boundaries were redrawn to include a large bloc of ANC supporters. It is conceivable that local party activists, stung by the loss of influence that comes with control of a ward, wanted to change the composition of the electorate.</p> <p>Yet if the first days of unrest strongly echoed a fight that took place 12 years earlier, there were marked differences. In 1996, the violence remained party political, and it stayed in Alexandra. This time, the troubles spread quickly, and as they did so they lost much of their ethnic character. In Ramaphosa, where Benny and Kate Sithole fled their home, the IFP has little or no presence. \"The people marching and singing through Ramaphosa were Zulu, Xhosa, Pedi, South Sotho: they were all South Africans mixed,\" Sithole said. Of the scores of refugees we interviewed who had taken refuge at police stations and town halls, most said they had run from \"thugs\", \"young ruffians\" and \"drunks\", all speaking a mixture of languages.</p> <p>Victim after victim told us that the violence took them by surprise. And yet, clearly, the news from Alexandra that mobs had turned upon foreigners stirred a powerful current, inspiring people around the city and the country to do the same. The mobs sang of foreigners stealing houses, women and work. Behind their choice of words lies much of the explanation of the violence.</p> <p>\"People say there is a struggle for resources going on between South Africans and foreigners,\" a senior Johannesburg bureaucrat, who asked not to be named, told us. \"Actually, the struggle is long over. The foreigners have won hands down.\"</p> <p>He is exaggerating, but a study recently conducted by the authoritative Centre for Development and Enterprise found that the unemployment rate among foreign nationals in Johannesburg was 20%. The roughly equivalent figure for South Africans in Johannesburg is 33%. In that large difference lies an important story. Of the 80% of foreign nationals who work, more than half are self-employed. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that most arrived here illegally, without benefit of venture capital or even a bank account. Many are what development economists call survivalists, working long and difficult hours to earn the equivalent of an unskilled labourer's wage.</p> <p>Many, though, are much more than that. The study found that foreign nationals employ 100,000 South Africans across Johannesburg. This entrepreneurship is the face of immigration in the poor neighbourhoods. From sidewalk barbers to fresh produce traders, their work is conducted on the streets and in roadside stalls. As for wage labour, anecdotal evidence suggests that employers are recruiting foreigners over South Africans in construction, security and domestic work, according to Professor Lawrence Schlemmer, who managed the Centre for Development and Enterprise study.</p> <p>In housing, there is a parallel story. Since coming to power, the ANC government has built more than two million homes, known as RDP houses, for the poor. Walk into any shantytown, and people will show you the document proving that they have been on a waiting list for a house for five or 10 years. A common complaint among those waiting is that many RDP homes are occupied by foreigners who have acquired them by corrupting government officials. There are other explanations.</p> <p>\"What an unemployed person needs above all,\" said Julian Baskin, of the Alexandra Renewal Project, \"is income. Give an unemployed person a house and she will be tempted to sell it. The banks won't underwrite the sale. It must be cash. So it's cheap. Foreigners in South Africa working or running a business will have cash. It figures that they'll be well represented among secondary buyers of RDP homes.\"</p> <p>Of the 50 or so refugees we interviewed, almost all worked, either as wage labourers or as entrepreneurs. Most said that a great many of the South Africans they encountered every day were unemployed. When we asked why they appeared to find work more easily than South Africans did, many answered by disparaging their South African neighbours. \"To be selling fresh vegetables by seven in the morning,\" Benny Sithole told us, \"I must start making my way to the fresh produce market at 3am. I can say that there is not a single South African awake at that time. The people on the street preparing for work are foreigners, every last one of them. For the South African, 3am is too cold. He must sleep until eight.\"</p> <p>A Mozambican we met, who identified himself as Alberto, had run a construction business in South Africa for the past five years. He employed eight people, all recruited from his village in Mozambique. \"We arrived in this country without tools,\" he said. \"At first we accepted any job, even if it paid R40 ($5) a day. A South African will not work for that amount, especially not for a white man. As we worked, so we saved. We bought tools. When we started the business, we offered to build for very little money. Business picked up. We charged more. As we gained success, so we bought televisions and stereos and other nice things. The South Africans got angry and wanted to steal our nice things. From their point of view, what they saw was foreigners coming to do work they refused to do and then buying things they could not afford.\"</p> <p>Refugees we spoke to believed that South Africans were workshy because they looked to the state for their salvation. A Malawian named Napier Banda, who, until the troubles, lived in a small shack settlement on the outskirts of Boksburg, said, \"Many of my South African neighbours were unemployed. Most of them were Zulu. They complained that the reason they had no work was that Thabo Mbeki was a Xhosa. They said that when Jacob Zuma [who is Zulu] comes to power, he will deliver for them.\"</p> <p>As we toured one site of violence after another, it became apparent how overwhelmingly local politics are consumed by struggles over state patronage. In Alexandra, a building contractor constructing RDP homes on the eastern rim of the township complained he was forced to source his labour through a local ANC man, who skimmed off the top of everyone's wage. Those squatting in abandoned factories to the north of Alexandra were required to pay rent to an executive member of the South African National Civics Organisation, a body aligned to the ANC.</p> <p>In a shantytown called Jerusalem, a few minutes' drive from Ramaphosa, we met a South African woman named Grace Obose, who ran a police-sanctioned citizen's patrol group. We asked if anyone had ever threatened her. \"The only time they tried to kill me,\" she said, \"was before the 2006 municipal election. There was a fellow in the ANC who very much wanted to stand as a councillor in this ward. But someone else was already standing. So he and his backers joined the Pan African Congress. I have a big following in this community. They told me I must come with them to the PAC so they could win. I kept saying no. One night they threw petrol on my shack and lit a match. Thank God I was awake and escaped.\" In Jerusalem, who had access to the local government budget was clearly a matter of life and death.</p> <p>At a workers' hostel in south Johannesburg, inhabited primarily by networks of Zulu migrants from KwaZulu-Natal, we interviewed the local IFP leader, Boy Simelani. \"The ANC has sewn up the 2009 elections,\" he complained, \"because of the World Cup in 2010. All the construction for the World Cup is controlled by the ANC. They will be handing out the jobs. Our chance to win votes will come only after the World Cup is finished.\"</p> <p>Those who believe that income derives primarily from state patronage essentially view the national economy as one great barrel around which everyone gathers to feed. You jostle with your neighbours for access to it. You fight for your share. And if this is how you see things, the presence of several million foreigners becomes both a special provocation and a source of confusion. For with their stalls and businesses and incessant work, they seem to be taking something that ought to have been given to you, the patrimony owed to you as a person who survived apartheid and voted into power a democratic government.</p> <p>This is how those who admitted to us that they had taken part in the violence justified what they had done. Two weeks after an immigrant was burned to death in Ramaphosa, the ANC Women's League held a prayer meeting on the spot where the mob had set him alight. Outside the meeting a group of sullen young men gathered to express their discontent. One of them, who identified himself as David, told us he had joined the crowd and driven out foreign nationals because they were stealing chunks of South Africa's economy. \"This entire country is leaking into the pockets of Mozambicans,\" he said. One of his companions joined in: \"They have flooded this country like water, but they are leaving our land dry.\"</p> <p>And the hostility is not simply directed at foreigners. Grace Obose told us that while the mob that ran riot in Jerusalem targeted foreigners, \"it also attacked the two biggest shebeens [drinking dens]. Both are owned by South Africans.\" The mob had formed to loot and it no longer cared for the distinction between being foreign and being relatively wealthy. The two had become the same.</p> <p>Why have many South Africans come to see their democracy as a battle for state patronage? Moeletsi Mbeki, an outspoken critic of his brother Thabo's former government, and the only South African commentator whose opinions make headline news, tells a withering tale. When it was clear that apartheid was dying, he says, South Africa's captains of industry asked themselves what to do to prevent the country's liberation movement from nationalising the banks and mines, as promised. Their solution was to offer to buy off the new political elite: to offer it large chunks of equity across South Africa's economy. The new elite said yes, and the pact was sealed.</p> <p>The government has called the programme Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). The rationale of BEE is to \"transform the white-owned economy to be representative of the demographic make-up of the country as a whole\". Yet Mbeki is fond of pointing out that the major beneficiaries of large equity transfers are all individuals connected to the ANC. For that is precisely the point: what is being traded is political influence.</p> <p>The ANC, Mbeki argues, is behaving precisely the way the first generation of post-independent African elites did in the 60s, using the state power it has captured to enrich itself. Perhaps the struggles for state patronage witnessed at the sites of the recent violence were a case of a people doing just as their leaders have done.</p> <p>Worryingly, South Africans appear unable to talk much about any of the major ingredients of May's violence. Ethnic differences, clearly an important subtext during the troubles, are a taboo subject. Nor can South Africans talk with much freedom about the resentment they feel for having to share their country with several million foreign nationals. \"Our country belongs to all Africans,\" is a phrase government officials and ANC functionaries have repeated over and again since the troubles. Nor are political corruption and kickbacks subjects for polite conversation. South Africans find themselves in the midst of a very serious impasse about which they cannot speak.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonny Steinberg's new book, Three-Letter Plague, is published by Vintage in January</p>",
  "<p>I'm standing on the terrace of a house on top of a cliff high above Tarifa on Spain's Costa de la Luz. I'm hoping it's El Cancho, the house I'm supposed to be staying in. But I can't be sure. Seconds after arriving, and with my hand poised on the handle of the large glass doors, the lights went out. So now I am standing in the pitch black of a moonless night. The wind has picked up. The house is being flagellated by unseen branches, and the rain is spraying across like machine-gun fire. El Cancho or not, I'm going in.</p> <p>Groping around using my cigarette lighter, I discover a bottle of wine and a note saying Welcome to El Cancho. There's a booklet explaining where everything is: a torch in the drawer (there isn't) and loads of candles in the cupboard (there are). I light a dozen tea lights and scatter them around the room. It's the most romantic place I've ever been on my own. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338257532\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/02/ElCancho220.jpg\" alt=\"El Cancho\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view from El Cancho</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I put my face against the window. Over the water, Africa is ablaze with lights, while I'm on the Coast of Light, in darkness. </p> <p>\"Sorry about that. It'll probably be the battery not charging properly,\" says Tom, the next morning. Tom, the owner, from London, is having a late-season break with his family at the house across the way (El Cancho consists of two properties). \"It's usually working fine but we're solar-powered here and these things can happen.\"</p> <p>Power restored, Tom invites me over to the other house for coffee. There I meet his wife, Sara, who is nursing a new-born baby Nicholas, and Pablo, their 14-month-old son. </p> <p>We walk on to the terrace. Surrounded by lemon trees and nestling in an amphitheatre of rock topped with jagged pinnacles and high above the Strait of Gibraltar, it is a truly spectacular setting. Only 14km away, the minarets of Tangiers twinkle in the sunlight.</p> <p>Tom gives me the tour of the single-storey house. With the Moorish influences of Africa so close, the surrounding Andaluc\u00edan landscape and the accompanying cicada and goat-bell soundtrack, it is somewhat disconcerting to walk into an Ikea showhome, a fusion of Scandinavian, Japanese and modern.</p> <p>Tom explains that, five years before, he'd bought the plot of land and was keen to build a house that was both eco-friendly and cheap. He'd remembered reading about a house Wallpaper* magazine had commissioned renowned Swedish architect Thomas Sandell to build for an exhibition in Milan. Tom called the magazine to ask if they still had the plans, and was surprised when they told him the house was flat-packed, still in storage in Birmingham and, if he collected it, he could have it for the knock-down price of \u00a37,000.</p> <p>\"It took eight days to build for the Milan architecture show, and eight months to build here,\" says Tom. \"There were few instructions and they were in Swedish. I got the Swedish translated into Spanish so the carpenters could at least try to guess how it all went together.\"</p> <p>The \"insideouthouse\", as Sandell calls it, \"blurs the boundaries between indoors and outdoors\", or some such architectural idiom, and it is a gift on the Coast of Light, allowing sunshine to stream through glass sliding doors and screen walls of opalescent plastic. The white-painted pine floors extend up the walls and across the ceilings. The furniture is beech and stainless steel and just like you imagine your house might look after you return from Ikea but, somehow, never does.</p> <p>In one of the bedrooms, the low ceiling is entirely covered in a photograph of a Swedish birch forest, while following the U-shape of the house to its end, past three couchette-style bunks, brings you into an enclosed empty courtyard which Sandell intended as an open-air \"Zen bathroom\", but which Tom and family and guests tend to use for parties. </p> <p>\"We knew nothing about architecture,\" says Tom. \"But when we told friends in the know that we'd bought a Sandell house, they whispered the name back reverentially, like we'd bought an original work of art. He's considered the Scandinavian Richard Rogers.\"</p> <p>The smaller house I'm staying in was bought two years ago from a firm in Boston, which specialises in flat-pack cabins that Americans, pursuing their dreams of Walden, can plonk by a lake or up in the mountains. Like the big house, it is furnished basically, but stylishly, and is almost totally self-sufficient. </p> <p>\"For now, the fridge and hot water are powered by butane, but we are looking to run those off the solar panels as well. The water comes from a spring and we're looking into buying Segway scooters and electric cars that guests can take to the beach or into town. We want to be totally off-grid.\"</p> <p>I walk down the steep hillside from El Cancho, zigzagging through the eucalyptus trees, dodging the cattle, and across the main coast road to the beach. The breeze has completely died now - autumn brings the end of the perfect levante winds - and the kite surfers, for whom Tarifa is the centre of the universe, sit dolefully, staring at the limp flags. I had planned to rent a kite myself, but settle instead for a glass of iced white sherry and a plate of serrano ham and manchego cheese at the beach-front terrace of La Pena del Torres, a laid-back kind of place. </p> <p>Later, I stroll a few kilometres west to Valdevaqueros. These are the beaches of childhood memories. </p> <p>Wide, sandy, where people ride horses, cows roam and dogs are welcome. Campervans sit in car parks bearing Free Tibet stickers. There are no sun loungers for hire, no music blaring from bars; no bars at all, save for the odd surfer shack. If I'd been frustrated at not being able to kitesurf, I wasn't anymore. This place slows the pulse, makes you feel happy doing nothing at all. </p> <p>There's a wildness here, a sense that it doesn't belong to anybody, or rather belongs to everybody. The developers who have concreted over much of the rest of the Spanish coastline seem to have forgotten to peek their heads over the mountains west of Algeciras. It's amazing really, that Tarifa, the most perfect of coastlines, has been spared.</p> <p>At sunset, Tom brought a torch (a wind-up one, naturally) to the small house and we sat on the deck drinking a beer. I asked him why he thought Tarifa had escaped the developers.</p> <p>\"Did you notice all the cranes over Tarifa town and the half-built industrial estate on the outskirts?\" Tom said. \"Well, the developers arrived and there were plans to build a motorway and golf courses and big resorts. The council was ready to push the button. Then Spain was hit hard by the recession and all the plans were shelved. For now, anyway.\"</p> <p>As Tom wandered back to his family, the lights clunked off again, and I was sitting in the dark once more. Cruise ships ghosted silently through the Strait, brilliantly ablaze. The goats came past, sounding like some crazed Hare Krishna parade. The cicadas were in full cry. They say, on some nights, when the wind is right, you can hear the sound of the muezzin drifting across the water from Tangiers. I thought about flicking the trip switch that Tom had shown me.

I'm not a particularly heavy sleeper and I'm used to being woken at odd times of the night. But this was different. It was the muffled sound of a woman's sobs coming from somewhere outside. I thought it could be in the street and got up to look out of the window but it was too dark to see. By now the crying was more despairing - it sounded like a woman being attacked. </p> <p>I can't explain what motivated me to rush downstairs and confront whatever was out there. I felt a flood of adrenaline, as if I was overwhelmed by a driving force and viewing myself from above. I ran out of the front door and there in our garden was a semi-naked man lying on the ground, silhouetted in the moonlight. Pinned underneath him was the woman I had just heard. Their bodies were hidden between my car and the garden hedge where he had dragged her from the street. The contents of her handbag were strewn across our path - bank cards, address book, make-up. I could see her underpants were torn and her ripped tights were round her ankles.</p> <p>My only thought was that I had to stop him. I screamed, \"I'm going to get you, you bastard!\" and dashed to shut the gate to stop him escaping. </p> <p>The woman stood up. Her hair was matted with blood from where he'd hit her head on the ground. She was in her 20s, someone's daughter; I wanted to protect her, put my arms around her. I also wanted to call the police but I knew that would mean running back inside the house and I didn't want the man to escape. </p> <p>I started screaming and begging for someone to call the police. No one came to help, but by this time my husband had woken up and, hearing the screams, had followed me down and was right behind me. The man stood up, calmly pulling up his trousers. I remember thinking how cold and calculated he seemed. Usually you can tell if someone is out of it, drunk or glazed, but he didn't seem like that. Instead he calmly said, \"Call the police then.\" The four of us stood facing each other in a bizarre standoff, but then he ran to the six foot-high gates and tried to sprint over them. He fell backwards and my husband managed to grab him and force him into a headlock. I ran inside and called the police. </p> <p>It seemed to take ages for them to arrive. I kept thinking, \"Why aren't they flooding the area?\" Suddenly, the woman grabbed her mobile phone and tried to take a picture of the man. He went berserk, struggled free from my husband and catapulted over the wall. We couldn't believe he'd escaped. </p> <p>While we waited for the police, I comforted the woman and she told me how relieved she'd felt when she'd seen me. She said she had been walking home along the main road at the end of our street when the man had come up behind her and dragged her into the nearest garden he could find.</p> <p>The police eventually arrived and for the next 24 hours our house was wrapped in crime scene tape. All my husband's clothes were sent away for forensic tests. Even the gate the man had tried to climb over was taken away. It was a horribly unnerving time. The reality of what had happened sunk in and we felt we were being watched. We knew he was still out there.</p> <p>Several weeks later, the police caught him. We found out he had been on a rampage that night, attempting to rape four women. Each attack was more violent than the last, the final assault in our garden being the worst. Thankfully the youngest victim, 16 years old, had come forward and told the police how she'd been attacked that night near a train station, close to where we live. They had caught the man chasing her on CCTV. </p> <p>The police told us something much worse could have happened if we hadn't intervened that night, but I don't feel particularly proud or brave. In some ways it was a foolish risk; he could have had a knife or even a gun. I just feel lucky he didn't attack me or my husband.</p> <p>The case came to court last December. We sat there facing the attacker's parents and girlfriend. She had his baby while he was on remand. There was no statement from him to say he felt remorse. The defence maintained he was high on drugs that night. He got an eight-year sentence. He'll be out in four.</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have an experience to share?

  "<h2>Any solution for a sticky problem?</h2> <p><strong>I spilled superglue on an antique desk. How do I remove the marks?</strong></p> <p>Acetone (the main ingredient in nail polish remover) removes superglue - but it may damage the surface. If anything can work without having to sand and revarnish, it's probably Super Solvent glue remover (\u00a37.33, from <a href=\"http://www.theglueguy.com\">theglueguy.com</a>). The Glue Guy, antiques restorer Jim Landis, confirms that this safely removes nearly all types of superglue spills from all sorts of surfaces, but stresses that it is very important to test on a hidden area first. 'If, in testing, you find that our remover removes or dulls the finish, you'll need to be more cautious. In most cases you can simply put a little remover on a cotton bud and carefully dab it on the superglue only. When it becomes soft, lift off the glue with a soft rag before doing a final cleanup with furniture polish or lemon oil.' </p> <h2>Can our cooking range be restored?</h2> <p><strong>We have an old cooking range that is covered in layers of black paint.

You could use a product such as Nitromors All Purpose Paint &amp; Varnish Remover (from DIY stores and decorating shops), but it would be less hazardous to opt for an eco-friendly paint stripper such as Home Strip (<a href=\"http://www.ecosolutions.co.uk\">ecosolutions.co.uk</a>, 01934 844484). This requires time and patience, and maybe several applications. When all the paint is removed, rub down using fine wire wool before applying a product such as Stovax Black Grate Polish (01392 474000, <a href=\"http://www.stovax.com\">stovax.com</a>), which, with elbow grease, should give you the finish you are after. </p> <p>If you can't face doing it yourself, you could get it sandblasted by a specialist such as The Cast Iron Reclamation Company (020-8977 5977, <a href=\"http://www.perfect-irony.com\">perfect-irony.com</a>), which will charge around \u00a3600 for doing it in situ, or \u00a3400 if the range can be taken away.

Where can I get stylish labels? </strong></p> <p>The world of storage jar labels is a chintzy one, but we have tracked down a couple of more contemporary options that may suit you. The cheapest are the blue-bordered Not Simply Storage Jar Labels (code AWLSC), from Cookability (01453 521368, <a href=\"http://www.cookability.biz\">cookability.biz</a>). They measure 69mm x 22mm and come in packs of 32 - half blank and half pre-printed - at \u00a31.95 a pack. Velvet Brown's ceramic jar labels are a contemporary (if pricey) alternative to the standard sticker. Pre-printed in English, French and Italian with store cupboard basics such as flour and salt, they are tied around the rim of storage jars; \u00a327.50 for a set of six (01844 278866, <a href=\"http://www.velvetbrown.co.uk\">velvetbrown.co.uk</a>). You can get a similar look for a fraction of the price with luggage tags: simply label in your best handwriting and tie to your jar.</p> <h2>Wanted: wooden clotheshorse</h2> <p><strong>I have recently installed an Aga and want an old-fashioned wooden clotheshorse to go around the front of it.

  "<p>Britain's baffling collection of ungrammatical, misspelt, out of date and plain wrong public signs is to have a national audit, with the public recruited as error spotters.</p> <p>Starting with Leeds, local authorities hope to eradicate signs which point both ways at once, publicise closed attractions or demolished landmarks, and omit aids to clarity such as capital letters and apostrophes.</p> <p>The move follows years of piecemeal campaigning which has led to minor successes.

It is never acceptable to create a situation where children might stumble across pornography.

  "<p>On my 18th birthday, the marketing department of the Gillette Company sent me a surprise gift: a SensorExcel razor. Back then, in the mesozoic era of razor blade development (circa 1995), the SensorExcel was the latest in state-of-the-art swizziness, with its five \"soft, flexible microfins\" which stretched the skin and caused the beard hairs to perk up like so many unwary soldiers poking their heads over the parapet, all the easier to be mown down by the two spring-mounted blades following fast behind. These days, the SensorExcel is a quaint museum piece, having been superseded by razors with first three, then four and now five blades, not to mention all the other add-ons: lubricating strips, pivoting heads, low-friction blade coatings, battery-powered vibrations, trimmers and even microchips.</p> <p>The three-bladed Gillette Mach3 was introduced in 1998; Wilkinson Sword (Schick in the US) upped the ante with the four-bladed Quattro in 2003. In February 2004, the satirical online newspaper the Onion ran a spoof article, supposedly by the CEO of Gillette, under the headline Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades. Sure enough, a couple of years later, they did: the Fusion. The Economist, a magazine not normally inclined to scoff at those cornerstones of market capitalism, innovation and growth, took a leaf out of the Onion's book and ran a semi-humorous article suggesting that, if current trends continue, \"blade hyperdrive will be reached in the next few years\". A pseudoscientific graph showed the number of blades shooting hyperbolically off the chart before 2020.</p> <p>But just what is it about adding blades that makes a razor better? And is it simply a question of adding blades? If so, how hard can it be? Do the companies already have six-, seven-, eight-, nine- and 10-bladed razors ready and waiting to be rolled off the production line whenever they feel they're slipping behind in the arms race? Shaving is serious business: in the UK alone, men spend more than a quarter of a billion pounds a year on razors and blades. That market is dominated by Gillette, which claims a 79.8% value share. That's 79.8% of the money, rather than of the number of razors: one reason for the disparity is that Fusion blades cost twice as much as Quattro refills.</p> <p>Neither Gillette nor Wilkinson Sword would reveal the size of their annual research and development budget. But in 2005, Peter Hoffman, then the president of Gillette's blades and razors division, told BusinessWeek that the development of the Fusion cost slightly less than the $680m they'd spent on creating the Mach3 a decade earlier. Whether this is a lot more than, a lot less than or about the same as Procter &amp; Gamble spend on developing a new line of Always sanitary towels or Olay face creams is a secret they're keeping to themselves.</p> <p>The company was founded by the American entrepreneur King Camp Gillette in 1901 to mass-produce the disposable-blade safety razors he'd invented, for which he obtained a patent in 1904. Gillette is often credited as the inventor of the safety razor, though it had actually been around in various forms since the mid-19th century. His real innovation was the \"razor and blades business model\", also less politely known as \"freebie marketing\": give away the durable handles, flog the disposable blades (or \"cartridges\", as the modern multibladed razor heads are called in the trade). The company still relies on the model, as evidenced by my 18th birthday present. It's highly effective, and seems almost insultingly simple. The catch is that it also depends on technical innovation: freebie marketing wouldn't have worked for King Gillette if he hadn't come up with an affordable way to manufacture the blades.</p> <p>Since the days of its founder, Gillette's headquarters have been in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2005, the company was bought for $57bn by Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods behemoth based in Cincinnati, Ohio. (Wilkinson Sword gets passed around a bit, too: in 2003, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sold it to the battery manufacturer Energizer Holdings.) The Gillette Technology Centre, however, is tucked away on an industrial estate between the A33 and the Old Basingstoke Road in Reading, Berkshire. It's an overcast morning in late summer when I pull into the visitors' car park, opposite the dozen or so spaces reserved for \"shave test panellists\", for a tour.</p> <p>\"I'm going to challenge you as you walk around,\" says the friendly, enthusiastic and clean-shaven lab director, Kevin Powell, \"to find the group that is actually tasked with adding blades.\" He laughs. \"That's the first question I normally get when I go to a cocktail party. Ho ho ho. Did you add some more blades today?\" He shows me a patent from the 30s for an unwieldy, five-bladed razor that looks as if it wouldn't have been out of place in a medieval torture chamber. \"It must have been excruciatingly uncomfortable,\" he says. \"Just adding blades most certainly doesn't do it.\" He prefers to talk about the shaving \"surface\", a term Gillette trademarked, though it's hard not to see that as a semantic dodge to flummox the cocktail-party piss-takers. The surface does, after all, consist of a (growing) number of blades.</p> <p>Anne Stewart, the centre's director for science, explains the thinking behind multiblade razors. It's all down to \"a phenomenon we refer to as hysteresis\". According to the Chambers Dictionary, hysteresis is \"the retardation or lagging of an effect behind the cause of the effect\", or \"the influence of earlier treatment of a body on its subsequent reaction\". In shaving terms, this means that when a razor blade encounters a hair, it doesn't only cut through it, it also pulls it a little way out of its follicle. So if there's another blade following close behind, it will slice into the hair lower down the shaft, before it has had time to retract into the follicle. \"You've actually shaved below the skin level,\" Stewart says. \"Can you ever get a closer shave with a single-edge cut-throat razor? In a stroke, no.\" Wilkinson Sword agree that the benefit of several blades is \"closeness - in the case of Quattro with no compromise on safety\".</p> <p>In the high-speed filming lab, I watch magnified, slow-motion footage of a five-bladed Fusion cartridge sliding down a few millimetres of anonymous cheek. The first blade strikes a hair, slices into it, tugs it out; the second blade hits, slices again, drags the hair out even farther; the third blade strikes, then the fourth, then the fifth, each nicking off a chunk of the hair, though a smaller fraction each time. Adding blades, then, does lead to a closer shave, if with diminishing returns. But it's not simply a question of how many blades you have in your cartridge.</p> <p>\"The spacing between the blades is critically important,\" Stewart says. Too close together and you could get two blades in the hair at the same time, which would apply too much force to the hair and be painful. There also wouldn't be enough room between the blades for the debris to be rinsed through and the cartridge would get clogged. Too far apart and the hair will have retracted into the follicle before the second blade gets its chance to bite. There's also the danger that the skin will fold into too big a bulge between the blades: \"And that causes skin discomfort and irritation as you come through.\" Finally, the larger the surface, the greater the drag, which again leads to discomfort. So the challenge was to fit five sharp enough, strong enough blades, with enough space between them, into a small enough area, to give a noticeably closer, more comfortable shave. \"In terms of pushing the technology,\" Stewart says, \"being able to weld the blades on the small blade supports was a real key enabler.\" </p> <p>The prototypical five-bladed surface - codename: Surf - was \"tested on literally thousands of men,\" Powell says. \"Did that surface wow them? Unequivocally, yes.\"</p> <p>There's more to the Fusion, however, than the five-bladed shaving surfaceTM. On the back of the cartridge there's a sixth blade, a single \"precision trimmer\", for doing trickier areas, such as under the nose, and to get nice, straight edges on your sideburns or goatee. The Wilkinson Sword Quattro Titanium, a jazzed-up version of the Quattro introduced last year, in part, no doubt, as a response to Gillette's Fusion, has an edging blade on the back, too. With the Mach3, \"there was a very low level consumer complaint\", Stewart says, \"with a high level of frustration, about being able to trim.\" This is the downside of adding blades and creating surfaces: it's hard to cut a straight line with a plane rather than an edge. And once they've experienced the simple joys of an unpivoted single blade - ironically enough, the same principle as the cheapest kind of disposable razor - there's no going back for Gillette's guinea pigs. When making a prototype, Powell says, \"sometimes it's easier for us to try to do it without putting a trimmer on the back. It's a revolt. They go: 'I can't do that!' \"</p> <p>\"They\" are the shave test panellists, the 80 men who go to the technology centre five mornings a week, 50 weeks a year, to have their daily shave with one of Gillette's experimental prototypes. The \"consumer testing facility\" is in a separate building from the research and development labs. As we walk from one to the other, Powell says, \"We are very much on lockdown because, let's face it, there's a huge amount of commercial potential locked up in there.\" He pointed back at the main building. \"But a lot of these ideas, although clearly we prosecute for patents - you know, we apply for patents - but nonetheless a lot of those things haven't even started yet. So there's a complete lockdown.\" The Fusion system has more than 70 patents registered on it; the Wilkinson Sword Quattro range has more than 100.</p> <p>The consumer testing facility smells strongly of shaving foam. When the panellists arrive, they have to check in - there's a \"pin verification system\" to exclude interlopers - then each is given his \"shave box\" with the day's razor in it and a barcode that has to be scanned, to make sure everyone gets the right box. \"The one thing you want absolutely to ensure is there's never an opportunity for somebody to shave somebody else's razor, from a cross-contamination point of view.\" (Powell talks about \"shaving a razor\", rather than \"shaving with a razor\", so that, grammatically speaking, the direct object of the verb is the razor, not the face. Though it probably wouldn't be fair to read too much into the idiom.) The panellists are closely observed as they shave and afterwards fill out questionnaires. I ask if they're paid. \"Yes, they are,\" Stewart says. \"Incentivised,\" interjects Jennie Larby, who's in charge of the facility. They don't tell me the size of the incentives.</p> <p>One of the panellists has volunteered to give a shaving demonstration. I watch him through a two-way mirror, video cameras trained on him over my shoulders. It's a strange, unsettling experience to look into a mirror and see another man shaving. He leans in close, turns his face this way, then that, stretches the skin of his cheek with his left hand while scraping at it with the razor in his right, pulls clownish expressions to tighten the muscles, seems to be peering intently into my eyes. I want to look away, but I can't. I make a joke about putting the videos on YouTube. Powell laughs politely, and says they take the panellists' privacy very seriously.</p> <p>\"It was only when I came here that I realised I'd been married to my husband for so long and I'd never watched him shaving,\" says Kristina Vanoosthuyze, one of Gillette's senior scientists. \"I stood next to him. 'How are you shaving exactly?' \"</p> <p>Stewart, too, takes a professional interest in her other half's grooming habits: \"After a while, he says, 'Do you know what? Can I just shave without you asking?' \" Vanoosthuyze's husband eventually told her to \"Go away and leave me alone!\" she jokes.</p> <p>Powell brings the conversation back to the matter in hand. \"You can never spend too much time with consumers,\" he says. \"It's amazing what you will learn from them.\"</p> <p>Down the hall from the high-speed video lab is the room where they do three-dimensional motion analysis using infrared cameras: \"It's the same system they use in some of the latest blockbusters, like Spider-Man or Lord Of The Rings.\" The changing positions of markers that reflect infrared light are triangulated by the cameras, so the movements of the razor and the shaver's arm can be recreated in a virtual 3D space on a computer. \"The way in which you hold that handle and you rotate that handle, if you watch men do it, it's quite amazing. You think they could all be cheerleaders,\" Stewart says. High-speed infrared cameras, running at around 2,000 frames a second, are also used to measure skin deformation and strain. A similar technique is used in the car and aeroplane industries, though Gillette have patented it for shaving research. Next door, sensors in a specially adapted razor measure the forces different men put on it while shaving.</p> <p>Analysis of all the data from all the different studies gives the researchers an idea of where there might be room for improvement, so the next stage is to build a new prototype the panellists can try out to see if it's any better. The razors are built virtually at first, using computer-aided design. These models are then turned into physical ones downstairs in the rapid prototyping area. The models are made by building up very, very thin layers of plastic, one on top of another. Dom Piff points to the work going on in one of his machines. \"That's a very large part for us,\" he says. \"It's like trying to cut Wembley football turf with an eight-inch blade.\" His fastest machine is the 3D printer, \"which is kind of like precision bombing\". Eight printheads, with 97 nozzles on each, pass from left to right, spitting out a liquid polymer that is instantly solidified by the ultraviolet light following behind. It makes a noise like a desktop computer printer, only louder. Piff gives me a souvenir: a blown-up plastic model of a Fusion cartridge with my name engraved on it.</p> <p>The machines that cut the metal parts in the working prototypes are accurate to within plus or minus 1.5 microns (thousandths of a millimetre). \"This is levels of accuracy greater than the watch-making industry,\" Stewart shouts over the noise of the equipment. \"More in among the medical industry.\" The incredible levels of precision have been emphasised all the way round the facility. Presumably that's the subtext of using Roger Federer, Tiger Woods and Thierry Henry in the Fusion ad campaign: here's a combination of more precision and accuracy than you know what to do with. \"If you take away only the one thing,\" Powell says, \"that's precision. And the consumer. That's it.\"</p> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking magnification was a major theme, too. Using a device called a micro-watcher, I was able to inspect my chin at 200 times lifesize. I hadn't shaved for a couple of days. The hairs looked revolting, the black ones like great greasy sticks of liquorice, the pale ones like shards of dirty glass. In the electron microscope area, there are pictures on the wall of various blade edges enlarged thousands of times: kitchen scissors, a kitchen knife, a surgical scalpel, a Fusion blade. Guess which is the sharpest. \"To be fair, the surgical scalpel is being asked to do a different task,\" Powell says.</p> <p>Each blade in a Fusion cartridge consists of a stainless steel core, coated with very thin layers of diamond-like carbon, for strength, and a Teflon-like polymer to reduce friction. I ask about planned obsolescence: a razor blade that never went blunt would be bad news for the industry. Stewart's answer implies that the idea of an unbluntable razor is a fantasy. \"You clearly don't want something that's fantastic but lasts one shave, because clearly that's not great for the shaver.\" I think this means you can't have both maximum sharpness and maximum durability, so you need to find a compromise.</p> <p>\"The only reason anything ever is in that razor is because it delights guys,\" Powell says. \"There is not one thing more in there than is needed to delight them. There are no gimmicks, no funny things, it's all about performance,\" he adds, though, when pressed, he does admit \"there's a cool toy factor built into it\". </p> <p>According to Gillette's own research, two out of three men prefer the Fusion to the Mach3. \"It's what guys seek,\" Powell says. </p> <p>They give me a Fusion Power Stealth to take home - more freebie marketing; I'd never have bought one - and I have to admit it is nicer to shave with, and gives a smoother result, than my old Mach3 (I reluctantly traded up from the SensorExcel a few years ago because Sainsbury's didn't have replacement blades). The single blade on the back is particularly handy. I can't say the friction-reducing vibrations do much for me - around the mouth, they feel as if you're having your teeth scaled and polished. The electric beard-trimmer on the end of the Wilkinson Sword Quattro Titanium Precision makes more sense (or would, if I had a beard that needed trimming).</p> <p>The point of the microchip in the Power models, incidentally, is threefold: to control the electrical discharge from the battery, so vibration levels are constant across the battery's life, rather than gradually weakening as it drains; to switch the motor off after eight minutes, in the event that it has been switched on accidentally; and to control the low-battery indicator light. It also allows the researchers to \"do things in terms of learning things about the consumer,\" Powell says, hastily adding: \"In our prototypes, clearly not in the product, in our research.\" </p> <p>Both firms are unsurprisingly cagey about where that research is taking them. I ask Wilkinson Sword if they have a six-bladed successor in the pipeline. \"RD&amp;E [research, development and engineering] is working consistently on upgrading our products,\" they say, \"and is evaluating all opportunities that our technologies are offering us.\" That's a resounding \"maybe\", then.</p> <p>I was more than persuaded by both firms that the technology isn't some kind of con: the researchers I met were all gifted, dedicated people, responding with infectious enthusiasm and flair to the real technical and intellectual problems with which they were presented. So, yes, the business is about fulfilling the consumers' desire for a better shave. But it's also about creating that desire: if the two out of three men who prefer the Fusion to the Mach3 had never been offered the Fusion, they'd never have known what they were missing. Still, that's capitalism for you. If you wanted an allegorical portrait of modern western capitalist society, you could do a lot worse than a man alone at a shaving mirror, intent on his own reflection, while from the other side of the glass a vast global corporation is watching, recording and planning what to sell him next.</p>",

The FSA also said it would consider changes to the rules about whether deposits were covered on a legal entity, \"brand\" or \"account\" basis.</p> <p>The existing compensation scheme is complex and limited and does not cover multiple accounts held by the same person in one bank, or deposits in several banks with the same ownership.</p> <p>Gordon Brown has been reluctant to introduce full guarantees for all bank deposits similar to the move announced by Ireland. It is estimated that offering protection to all UK deposits, including those held by businesses, would cost a staggering \u00a39tn. Ministers have also been wary of raising the guarantee threshold as this could add to banks' financial difficulties since it would involve them having to pay more into the compensation scheme which is funded by the industry.</p> <p>Sants said: \"There has been extensive debate about the compensation levels. In the interests of providing clarity over the minimum level for the long term we have now decided to implement the move to a \u00a350,000 limit from Tuesday.</p> <p>\"This change ties in with the introduction of the government's banking bill in parliament which is due next week, and is also appropriate given the consolidation that has taken place in the banking sector.\"</p> <p>\"In addition, the chancellor has made clear that the authorities will do whatever is necessary to maintain financial stability and protect depositors.\"</p> <p>The British Bankers Association said: \"The increase in the deposit guarantee limit to \u00a350,000 will bring welcome certainty for customers, 96% of whom were already covered under the existing deposit guarantee scheme\".</p> <p>The authorities are thought to have been concerned about heavy marketing by Irish banks aimed at small businesses which were attracted by the government guarantee. They hope that the extension to \u00a350,000 would help to address some of those concerns and make small businesses less likely to move their accounts.</p> <p>Ministers also believe that introducing a blanket deposit guarantee could send a signal to the market that they are extremely worried about the health of the British banking industry, adding to the crisis of confidence among the public. But a pan-European plan to issue the same level of guarantee across all EU countries is likely to be on the agenda at today's meeting of government leaders in Paris.</p> <p>City analysts expressed concern last night that large corporations were preparing to shift their cash out of Britain's big four clearing banks after a further deterioration in the international money markets.</p> <p>An exodus of corporate cash would deny the banks vital funds needed to shore up their ailing finances.</p> <p>Analysts said Irish banks would not be the only port of call for companies seeking a safe haven. They said government bonds were becoming popular on the basis that governments were the only organisations many companies believed to be immune from the threat of going bust. Almost 90% of small and medium-sized firms hold their savings with the big high street banks and many are facing a sharp increase in lending charges.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said one of its members had complained that Barclays increased its overdraft rate from 11% to 15% in the past week. Stephen Alambritis, an FSB spokesman, said he was concerned that banks were adopting lending practices \"that hark back to the bad old days of the early 1990s\". He said his members were funding themselves from savings in response to rising interest rates. Firms running down their savings would have the same effect on the banks as if they made a switch to safer deposit schemes.</p> <p>Brown made it clear at his news conference yesterday that he was concerned about the plight of smaller firms. He said support for companies should be part of a pan-European initiative and should be backed by EU ministers at a meeting convened by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, in Paris today.</p> <p>He said: \"One of the most important things that we will be active on is proposing a new initiative to help funding of small business in Britain and across Europe ... this is where governments have to step in. I'm talking about billions to be made available.\"</p> <h2>Backgrounder: Deposit protection scheme</h2> <p>Chancellor <strong>Alistair Darling, </strong>yesterday said the new <strong>\u00a350,000</strong> deposit guarantee will cover <strong>98%</strong> of all savings when its takes effect next Tuesday. Yet official data shows that British banks remain vulnerable to an exodus of cash if worries intensify about the stability of the banking system. </p> <p>While the vast majority of savers hold modest amounts of cash in deposit savings accounts and will be covered by the <strong>Financial Services Compensation Scheme</strong>, a wealthy elite accounting for only <strong>4%</strong> of savers holds <strong>45% </strong>of all savings by value. These wealthy individuals and small businesses have vast sums on deposit and bank sources report they are already moving their cash to safer havens.</p> <p>According to data compiled by the investment bank Credit Suisse, <strong>40% </strong>of all savings are above the \u00a350,000 limit.</p> <p>Banks are concerned that this group is already unnerved by reports of further turmoil and greater numbers will now seek a safer home for their funds. Businesses are also becoming nervous and shifting their cash deposits away from the big four banks to <strong>government bonds</strong> and other guaranteed products. Small and medium sized enterprises have about <strong>\u00a354bn</strong> on deposit with banks. The Federation of Small Businesses said its members were running down savings as they used the cash to prop up their struggling businesses.</p>",
  "<p>For those who think they know Henry Moore, there are still surprises. Last year's hugely successful exhibition in Kew Gardens countered the stolid image of predictable monumentality. Kew's splendid exotic plants, glass and cast-iron palaces and cranky 18th-century chinoiserie set up a kind of dialogue of playfulness and mystery that emphasised the innate surrealism in Moore's work. The current exhibition of the artist's textiles in the gallery adjoining his home, Hoglands, at Perry Green in Hertfordshire, is equally revealing. Here is Moore, the artist who said \"I am by nature a stonecarving sculptor, I like the resistance of hard stone\", working in the realms of the flimsy and ephemeral, and in zingy cold war colours - shocking pinks, lime greens and acid yellows - too.</p> <p>Many of these textiles designs emanated from a headscarf design project. Zika Ascher, a Czech textile manufacturer who had fled the Nazis in 1939, commissioned Moore, among other well-known artists - Graham Sutherland, Picasso, Matisse, Derain - to make designs for silk or rayon women's scarves, an indispensable fashion accessory in those days for all social classes, from the princess to the mill girl. By the time the first scarves were launched in 1946, Moore had filled four textile sketchbooks with his careful annotations and a free flow of ideas.</p> <p>The sketchbooks have only recently been rediscovered, and the designs show a domestic side of Moore still largely unrecognised. One of four Moore headscarf designs Ascher put into production was Three Standing Figures, the elongated shrouded shapes of which echo the carvings of that period. But the scale and technique are different. These figures were designed to be screen-printed on to parachute nylon and worn by actual women as they walked along the street. Art in motion, art subservient to human whim. The Ascher scarves were publicised as usable, adaptable - \"designed to fold, to throw on a table, to carry crumpled in the hand\".</p> <p>There is a lightness, wit and humanism in Moore's outburst of designs for textiles in the middle of the war. Some of his sketchbook ideas for curtain fabrics, with their draped and huddled human forms, have a tendresse reminiscent of his wartime shelter drawings. He was always intrigued by the fluidity of folds. Repeat patterns based on clock faces, insect wings and safety pins, caterpillars, watering cans and piano keys: this is consciously the imagery of everyday life, postwar art for the people, dealing in shared memories. These motifs were intended both for mass production and for popular consumption. Moore's fabric featuring barbed wire was used to make the dressing gown worn by Sally Gray in the Alberto Cavalcanti movie They Made Me a Fugitive (1947). </p> <p>\"Can Painters Design Textiles?\" In an article published in 1946, the critic Nikolaus Pevsner raised the question of whether artists demeaned themselves by association with the non-unique artefact. Moore, like others of his socialist artistic generation - Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, for example - disagreed with such an arrogant, elitist view of art. One of the delights of the current exhibition is following Moore's fabric designs beyond the gallery and into the domestic setting of the house in which he lived for more than 40 years.</p> <p>He and his wife, Irina, moved to Perry Green in 1940, during the early weeks of the blitz, having been bombed out of his Hampstead studio. Recently restored, Hoglands is now open to the public and Moore's textiles can be seen convincingly in situ. One of these is Heads, a frieze pattern based on a line of mask-like warriors, which the Moores used as curtains in the sitting room, office and kitchen. Opposite Heads in the kitchen hung Picasso's etching Sue\u00f1o y mentira de Franco (Dreams and Lies of Franco, 1937), acknowledging how indebted Moore's design was to Picasso, whom he had first met in Paris that year. A photograph in the Moore archive shows Irina sitting in an armchair stitching a rayon curtain in another of his beautiful 1940s fabrics, Horse's Head and Boomerang.</p> <p>Hoglands is a small timber-framed farmhouse in the countryside, partly medieval in origin. When the Moores first arrived, they rented only half the house. They later acquired the freehold of the whole. Gradually they bought more land around the house and built a small group of working studios. No doubt Hoglands appeared spacious in comparison with the Yorkshire miner's terrace house in Castleford in which Moore was brought up, three or four children crammed into a bedroom. But the house often struck visitors, and will no doubt still strike them, as a peculiarly modest habitat for an artist of such large-scale imaginative vision. Was this really the house of a sculptor who, by the time of his 1972 exhibition in Florence, was being solemnly compared with Michelangelo?</p> <p>In relation to other artists' houses open to the public, Hoglands lacks obvious charisma. And it isn't just the name, with its Monty Python overtones. In comparison with Red House at Bexleyheath, a romantic flowing building designed by Philip Webb for William Morris and described by a contemporary as \"more of a poem than a house\", the Moores' Hertfordshire home appears constricted and prosaic. Alongside the generosity of surface decoration and brilliant spurts of colour at Charleston in Sussex, the home of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Hoglands looks subdued. With its Scandinavian modern furniture and striped tweed curtains, the formal yellow sitting room at Hoglands, built as an extension in 1960, seems more like that of a successful country doctor or solicitor than Britain's best-known contemporary sculptor. </p> <p>You need to look quite closely to see the point of Hoglands, such a poignant illustration of Roger Fry's proposal: \"What if people were just to let their houses be the direct outcome of their actual needs, and of their actual way of life, and allow other people to think what they like.\" As a young man, Moore was greatly influenced by Fry, whose Omega Workshops produced a range of artists' textiles that were in many ways the forerunners of Moore's. The fascination of Hoglands is this muted quality, the sense of inner rhythms, of the \"actual way of life\" the family evolved there as the background to Moore's prodigious productivity. </p> <p>When Walter Gropius designed his ideal Masters' Houses for the artists of the Bauhaus - Moholy-Nagy, Feininger, Kandinsky, Klee - these were semi-detached houses with atelier included. Moore would have found this way of life a nightmare. To make art, he needed a departure from the house to the sculpture workshop or the maquette studio, his own creative domain where, as he once described it, he experienced utter serenity, the happiness of being \"fully engaged\". But he needed the house as the place of coming back to, for morning elevenses, four o'clock tea, a whisky in the evening before Hancock's Half-Hour or The Brains Trust on the black-and-white TV. Of course, Moore travelled - to America, to Greece, to Forte dei Marmi, where he had a summer house near the Carrara marble quarries. But when he returned to Hoglands, the even tenor of domestic routine was immutable.</p> <p>When the Tate took over Barbara Hepworth's Trewyn Studio in 1980, five years after her death, the living spaces were turned into a gallery. They kept the art but expunged the traces of her admirable terse, committed personality. This was surely a mistake. The only point of conserving an artist's house is to show how that artist lived in it and used it, bringing out the subtle interplay of art and daily life.</p> <p>At Hoglands, these connections and relationships are tangible. Alongside creating such monumental carvings as Family Group for Harlow New Town, Moore was constantly responding to domestic events, his own family minutiae, recorded in his sketchbooks. Mother and child images and tiny heads of babies proliferated after the birth of the Moores' only child, Mary, in 1946. Later, he made drawings of the schoolgirl doing homework. He drew his sister knitting. There are numerous portraits of the family dog Fawkes. It is striking how the public and private interact. </p> <p>In a recent book on Hoglands edited by David Mitchinson, Andrew Causey makes the point that Moore's identity was \"connected with the place, the ground under his feet, the flints, bones and driftwood that inspired him and which he kept lining his studio walls\". These objets trouv\u00e9s entered the house too, arranged to make a crowded still life on the coffee table in the yellow sitting room, juxtaposed with the Dubonnet bottle, soda syphon, ancient carvings, small-scale modern sculptures, including Moore's own alabaster Head of 1923. Visiting children were encouraged to examine the gnarled bones and stones with holes, and quizzed on which were the accidents of nature and which the Henry Moores. </p> <p>The sense of nature close around Moore was essential. Near the house there were the fruit trees and garden planted by Irina, a great lover of bright colours, with peonies, brilliant red tulips and geraniums, deep blue gentians. It was after moving to Hoglands, from the shelter drawings onwards, that colour became more important to Moore's work, burgeoning in the postwar textiles he designed for David Whitehead, as well as Ascher, and the figurative wall panels printed on to linen or woven cotton. These large-scale panels, some of which are on show in the current exhibition, make one sorry the artist had not been more involved with stage design.</p> <p>Eventually Moore owned 70 acres of Hertfordshire. Sheep grazed in fields around him. They became a fascination. He watched them from the window, stalked them through the grass. He came to love them and described how he \"began to think also about their immensely strong biblical associations\". As he observed them, the sheep that had at first seemed merely big balls of wool with a head and four legs took a precise form, so that in the end he could identify individual animals - the ones he had already drawn, and those that still awaited him.</p> <p>The sheep in turn adopted a Moore sculpture, the large two-part bronze known as Sheep Piece (still at Hoglands), nibbling at the grass around it, sheltering beneath it. Sheep were the right scale, he felt, beside his sculpture. A horse would be all wrong. Moore came to feel so easy in his close relationship with his environment that he was able to reshape it, constructing the low grassy hillock now surmounted by his Large Reclining Figure (1984), outlined so dramatically against the sky.</p> <p>Moore died in 1986, Irina three years later. Through the 1990s, Hoglands lay neglected and deteriorating. This was a decade of acrimonious dispute over ownership of works between the Moore family and the Henry Moore Foundation, eventually taken to the Court of Appeal in 1996. Hoglands was bought from the family by the foundation in 2004, and its subsequent careful restoration can be seen as an act of reconciliation.</p> <p>Many of the works of art Moore and his wife collected have now returned to the house. In the large yellow sitting room, for example, there is the Romanesque marble carving of a mourning angel attributed to Tino di Camaino, the great wooden Luba mask from the Congo, Courbet's La Grotte de la Loue; in the smaller sitting room, a maternal scene by Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re. It is this sense of artistic continuity, Moore's generosity of spirit in acknowledging the work of other artists, that gives the house its particular luminosity.</p> <p>The French have a stronger tradition than the British of restoring artists' houses. This country has tended to do better by its writers. The closest parallel to Hoglands I know is the house at Giverny, near Vernon, where Monet decided to settle in 1883. The pale salmon-pink house with its sage-green doors and shutters. The fields, the trees, the river Seine, those water-lily pools. Giverny, like Hoglands, is a place not of ostentatious \"artiness\", but of discreeter beauties. Monet's work, like Moore's, was rooted in those intimate surroundings and the settled rituals of a pleasant bourgeois life. </p> <p>It is easy to be snide about cultural tourism. Yet Moore had a great gift for transforming the mundane into the mythological, and exploring the setting of his day-to-day existence helps us to comprehend the art.</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Moore Textiles is at Perry Green, Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, until October 19 (visits by appointment on 01279 843333 or email <a href=\"mailto:visits@henry-moore-fdn.co.uk\">visits@henry-moore-fdn.co.uk</a>), then transfers to Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh, on November 14.

  "<h2>Countdown to America's first earth orbit</h2> <p><strong>The Guardian, February 22 1962</strong></p> <p>The morning of Colonel John Glenn's 11th date with an orbit dawned without clouds over Cape Canaveral and without high waves off Bermuda. And so at last the 18 tracking stations around the globe, the recovery ships, the 1,500 expert watchers were alerted for a \"Go\", the syllable the American people have been waiting to exhale since the middle of December.</p> <p>Twenty seconds from the word, the umbilical cord dropped away and Mercury Control intoned the countdown in seconds. There was the deep low-frequency rumble modulating to an enormous whoosh of sound and a vicious tongue of flame. Soon the Atlas rocket was a fiery keyhole, and then an acorn and then a snowflake. Within a minute or so the army of workers at Canaveral and the 500-odd reporters had lost all visible connection with their personal project and were at one with the silent crowds on the Florida beaches, in railroad stations and airports from New York to Seattle: gaping in extraordinary silence at giant television screens and hearing the elated exchange between Glenn and Mercury Control: \"On trajectory ... booster engines off ... tower gone ... go, baby, go ...\"</p> <h2>Explosion of the Challenger space shuttle</h2> <p><strong>Letter No 1928, January 31 1986 </strong></p> <p>I doubt that many of us would have been watching this launch if the schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe, had not been aboard. There have been 56 planned missions, and in the past few years, only the manned flights have been televised, and then not always live: the lift-off is taped at the launching and then replayed briefly on the evening news. For several years now, the work of NASA - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - has been no big deal to the ordinary citizen. The missions have become so routine that I suspect only space buffs could call off many names, or any names, of the astronauts of the past few years. To most people, John Glenn, who has long been Senator John Glenn, is the one unforgettable name: the first American to orbit the earth, and that's coming up 24 years ago in February.</p> <p>But, it was the president's idea of putting a schoolteacher in space that galvanised anew the popular interest. When the invitation went out over a year ago, there were more than 11,000 applicants. The selection committee, which combined a national council of school officers with a half dozen experts from NASA, went quickly through those 11,000 letters and chose only 114 teachers to interview. All of them first submitted to thorough physical examinations and psychiatric screening and were reduced to 10 finalists. </p> <p>Christa McAuliffe was 12 years old when Alan Shepard launched America's manned space programme in May 1961, with a 15-minute sub-orbital flight. That was inspiring stuff at the time, but was dimmed nine months later by Glenn's complete orbit of the earth. Christa McAuliffe watched the Shepard liftoff, and in her letter of application she wrote to NASA: \"I watched the Space Age being born, and I would like to participate.\" </p> <p>If not the space star of the crew, she became the vivid human link with all of us. For while the senator who had completed a space mission was a veteran fighterpilot in Vietnam, Christa McAuliffe was the first ordinary citizen to go into space.</p> <p>To me, when the nightmare sharpness of the horror has blessedly blurred with time, there will be, I'm afraid, one picture that will retain its piercing clarity. It is the picture of an inquisitive, innocent, middle-aged woman and her affable, granity husband - Christa McAuliffe's parents - craning their necks and squinting into the Florida sky, and watching the sudden fireball and looking a little puzzled as first-time spectators might, as if this were part of the show, part of the unexpected magic.</p>",
  "<p>One has to salute the Machiavellian genius of whoever it was at Penguin who had the idea of taking a chapter out of a book and reissuing it on its own. Whether more people will buy this than bought The Stuff of Thought, whence it originates, one cannot foresee; but I for one, having once run head-on into some very challenging sentences in his previous work (\"The double dissociation gives neural reality to a distinction we might have guessed on purely computational grounds, and it challenges connectionist models,\" and so on), am now a bit scared of him, however well he means and however clever he is. I gather that he has become more readable lately, but pulling out a chapter on rude words, giving it a striking and witty cover, may well be a shrewd move.</p> <p>At this point I had better warn you that this review is going to contain some rude words, and if you are offended by them, now is the time to move on. You never know who is going to take offence. As Steven Pinker informs us, there is an aboriginal language in which every word is taboo if spoken in front of your mother-in-law, \"and certain cousins\". </p> <p>But such taboos make a fascinating subject. The Daily and Sunday Telegraph will not be able to review Martin Rowson's excellent new book of cartoons, because it cannot print its title, which is Fuck!. The comic magazine Viz periodically refreshes its coffers by reissuing ever-expanded versions of its dictionary of rudeness, the Profanisaurus (highly recommended, by the way, and often painfully funny); the taboo is popular because it is taboo. Linguists such as Pinker have pondered on the unusual grammatical properties of the word \"fucking\" in sentences such as \"drown the fucking cat\" - it's not an adjective (you can't say \"drown the cat which is fucking\") - it's not an adverb, even when you say \"fucking brilliant\", for you cannot have a dialogue which goes \"How brilliant was it?\" \"Fucking.\" And you may remember the bit in Bill Bryson's Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way, where he ponders how odd it is that \"get fucked\" is such an insult when it appears to be an invitation to extreme pleasure. </p> <p>As to that last point, the linguist Quang Fuc Dong (yes, you read that right; he's a creation of the irreverent linguist Jim McCawley) pointed out that the \"fuck\" in \"fuck you\" is not a true imperative; you can conjoin two imperatives with a common object, as in \"clean and press these trousers\", but you can't say \"describe and fuck communism\". Also, he notes that all the taboo words for the act of sex are transitive; all the polite terms intransitive.</p> <p>We learn of the sly humour of his profession. Is \"bloody\" a contraction of \"by our lady\"? \"Not bloody likely,\" say the historians. You may be interested to learn that the reason you swear when you drop a car battery on your foot is that an electro-physiological response emanates from the anterior cingulate cortex; as Pinker informs us, \"in public, cognitive neuroscientists call this response the Error-Related Negativity; in private they call it the Oh-Shit Wave.\" (And common to all mammals is the Rage circuit, which runs from the amygdala, the hypothalamus and the midbrain, and makes your cat go nuts when you sit on it by mistake.)</p> <p>The great thing about Pinker's writing here is that he manages not only to communicate his own ideas with complete clarity (yes, he really is getting more readable), but he is capable of generating tangential thoughts in the reader. I would have liked to know what's going on in other languages; as when Collins, in its 1978 English-French dictionary, translates one of its many deadpan entries under the word \"fuck\", \"there's fuck-all to drink in this house\", as \"il n'y a pas une goutte \u00e0 boire dans cette putain de baraque\"; or why the line from Withnail and I, \"Monty, you terrible cunt\" is so oddly hilarious, or why Kingsley Amis's \"fuck off. No - fuck off a lot\" is so wounding. You can't have everything in 80-odd pages. But you do get an awful lot, and it's both instructive and great fun. How often do you get such a combination?</p>",
  "<p>Consumers poorly treated by their energy supplier, or indeed any other private company, have a new official organisation they can complain to.</p> <p>Formed by merging the National Consumer Council, Energywatch and Postwatch, Consumer Focus was born last Wednesday, with stronger teeth than its predecessors.</p> <p>For the first time, a UK consumer body will have the ability to demand information from companies.</p> <p>Energy and post companies will also have to take more responsibility for resolving complaints. </p> <p>The separate industry regulators, Ofgem and Postcomm, will now be able to fine companies that fail to meet tough new standards. </p> <p>Consumer Focus said it will be compiling and publishing data on how well companies are handling complaints. Under the scheme, to be headed by former NCC boss Ed Mayo, telephone helpline Consumer Direct has been handed a larger role.</p> <p>The new body will have 170 staff and an annual budget of some \u00a315m. Its powers will include the right to investigate any consumer complaint if it believes this to have a wider public interest, the right to demand information from the supplying company, the power to conduct research and the ability to make an official super-complaint about failing services.</p> <p>More significantly, the arrival of Consumer Focus has been accompanied by a tougher new regime for the energy suppliers.</p> <p>Any consumer whose complaint to their gas or electricity supplier is not dealt with in eight weeks will be able to take it to a new ombudsman, at <a href=\"http://energy-ombudsman.org.uk\">energy-ombudsman.org.uk</a> or on 0330 4401624 or 01925 530263. The service will be free to consumers but will cost the energy supplier several hundred pounds for each case.</p> <p>Consumer Focus said it intends to make fuel poverty its number one issue - vulnerable customers being threatened with disconnection by an energy supplier should contact it immediately. Its arrival was hailed by business secretary John Hutton. He said: \"One single body, rather than three, means a stronger voice holding business and government to account. It means a more joined-up approach to tackling problems. Energy and post companies will have to take greater responsibility for handling complaints or face significant fines. And where complaints can't be resolved voluntarily, new redress schemes give the system teeth.\"</p> <p>Ed Mayo, chief executive of Consumer Focus, said: \"We will campaign for a fair deal for consumers, because if consumers are confident then everybody - including families, business and the economy - benefits.\"</p> <p>However, the new entity has not been universally welcomed.</p> <p>Last month, the Commons business and enterprise committee said the demise of Energywatch was a \"spectacularly bad idea\" and put consumer protection at risk at a time when utility bills are shooting up.</p> <p>Other changes to business regulations coming into force require landlords to obtain energy performance certificates, costing up to \u00a380, for rented properties.</p> <p>\u2022 If you have a general consumer issue, contact Consumer Direct on <a href=\"http://consumerdirect.gov.uk\">consumerdirect.gov.uk</a> or 0845 04 05 06.

  "<p>We are winning in Iraq, John McCain declared in the presidential debate last week, \"and we will come home with victory and with honour.\" This may sound like some perfunctory keep-the-pecker-up stuff from a former military man. But the Republican candidate, who believes that the \"surge\" has succeeded in Iraq, also possesses the fanatical conviction that heavier bombing and more ground troops could have saved the United States from disgrace in Vietnam. </p> <p>On the same occasion, Barack Obama, who seems more aware of the costs of American honour to the American economy, claimed he would divert troops from Iraq to Afghanistan and, if necessary, order them to assault \"safe havens\" for terrorists in Pakistan's wild west. Both candidates sought the imprimatur of Henry Kissinger, the co-alchemist, with Richard Nixon, of the \"peace with honour\" formula in Vietnam, which turned out to include the destruction of neighbouring Cambodia. </p> <p>An ominously similar escalation of the \"war on terror\" has ensured that the next American president will receive a septic chalice from George Bush in January 2009. In July, Bush sanctioned raids into Pakistan, pre-empting Obama's tough-sounding strategy of widening the war in Afghanistan, where resurgent Taliban this year account for Nato's highest death toll since 2001. Pakistan's army chief vowed to defend his country \"at all costs\", and his soldiers now clash with US troops almost daily. Obscured by the American economy's slow-motion train wreck, the war on terror has already stumbled into its most treacherous phase with the invasion of fiercely nationalistic and nuclear-armed Pakistan. </p> <p>Most of the recent disasters of geopolitical machismo could have been foretold. In late 2003, when the occupation of Iraq was beginning to go badly wrong, the American journalist Dexter Filkins came across a village called Abu Hishma in the Sunni triangle. Rubble-strewn and \"encased in razor wire\", Abu Hishma resembled, Filkins writes in The Forever War: Dispatches from the War on Terror (Bodley Head), \"a town in the West Bank\". Its terrified residents told him about the local American commander Nathan Sassaman, who bulldozed homes and called in air strikes, and who was fond of proclaiming that \"there is no God - I am god here\". </p> <p>Sassaman sounds like something out of Conrad, the white man in the tropics driven to lunacy by absolute power and extreme isolation. But, according to Filkins, he is a bright man, even the \"embodiment of the best that America could offer\" in his desire to bring democracy to Iraqis. A serious reader of history and anthropology, Sassaman, along with fellow officers, is very impressed by a book entitled The Arab Mind, by Raphael Patai, a Hungarian-Israeli-American academic. Apparently, it makes clear that the \"only thing\" the denizens of the Middle East \"understand is force - force, pride and saving face\", and Sassaman believes that, \"with a heavy dose of fear and violence, and a lot of money for projects ... we can convince these people that we are here to help them\".</p> <p>Filkins doesn't mention that The Arab Mind, originally published in 1973, was the bible of neocon commentators in Washington and New York cheerleading the Bush administration's audacious venture: what Condoleezza Rice in the new book by Bob Woodward, The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008 (Simon &amp; Schuster), describes as shifting the \"epicentre of American power\" from Europe, where it had rested since the second world war, to the Middle East. Widely read in the US military, The Arab Mind later inspired the modus operandi of the jailers of Abu Ghraib. </p> <p>More surprisingly, respectable intellectuals, journalists and academics echoed its generalisations. Among these people was the historian Bernard Lewis, who assured Dick Cheney, one of his most devoted readers, that \"in that part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force\". The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman (who is on Sassaman's reading list) exhorted the US to act \"just a little bit crazy\", since \"the more frightened our enemies are today, the fewer we will have to fight tomorrow\". Accordingly, Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of state and a relative moderate among the Bush administration's hawks, told Pakistani diplomats that the US would bomb their country \"back to the stone age\" if it did not withdraw its support for the Taliban. </p> <p>The idea that the natives would recognise superior firepower when they saw it seemed to be validated by Pakistani acquiescence, followed by the Taliban's swift capitulation. Iraq was logically the next setting for shock-and-awe tactics - Donald Rumsfeld was complaining even before the aerial bombing of the Taliban had finished that Afghanistan had run out of targets. The Bush administration claimed that Saddam Hussein had to be disarmed to make the Middle East safe for democracy. But invading Iraq was also an image-making exercise - what Hannah Arendt, commenting on the absence of clear military goals in America's previous war of choice in Vietnam, described as the attempt by \"a superpower to create for itself an image which would convince the world that it was indeed 'the mightiest power on earth'\".</p> <p>Busy unleashing his awesome firepower on Iraq, Rumsfeld had no idea what to do after his streamlined army reached Baghdad, apart from letting stuff happen. Wiser in Battle, the memoir of the US lieutenant general Ricardo Sanchez (HarperCollins), reveals that, as the Iraqi resistance unexpectedly intensified, the defeat in Vietnam began to prey on Bush's mind, unravelling his syntax as he harangued his commanders in Iraq:</p> <p>Kick ass! ... We must be tougher than hell! This Vietnam stuff, this is not even close. It is a mind-set. We can't send that message. It's an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal ... There is a series of moments and this is one of them. Our will is being tested, but we are resolute. We have a better way. Stay strong! Stay the course! Kill them! Be confident! Prevail! We are going to wipe them out! We are not blinking!</p> <p>Thomas Ricks, the Washington Post's Pentagon correspondent, describes in his book Fiasco (Penguin) how, after a mob ambushed and killed four American military contractors in Falluja, the commanders were ordered to \"go in and clobber\". Citing strategic and logistical reasons, the military chiefs pleaded for restraint, but they were overruled by the White House: the destruction of Falluja was as essential to the image-making exercise as the carpet-bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia. </p> <p>The geopolitical consequences as well as the \"collateral\" damage of the exhibition of US might are succinctly outlined by the titles of recent books - The Forever War, Fiasco and Ahmed Rashid's Descent into Chaos (Allen Lane). Rashid is clearly the most despairing among the journalists accompanying the march of folly, even though, as a Pakistani long accustomed to the pretensions and limits of US power in south Asia, he didn't start off with many illusions. His previous book described how a combination of selfish motives and reckless actions by the US facilitated the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan and Afghanistan. \"Outsiders like me,\" he writes in Descent into Chaos, \"found it remarkable that a US president could live in such an unreal world, where the entire military and intelligence establishments were so gullible, the media so complacent, Congress so unquestioning - all of them involved in feeding half-truths to the American public.\"</p> <p>The habitual deceivers are often, in the end, the most deceived. According to Rashid, Pervez Musharraf's regime in Pakistan may have pulled off one of the biggest swindles in recent history by persuading the Bush administration to part with $10bn in exchange for mostly empty promises of support for its \"war on terror\". Most Pakistanis feel a mix of contempt and distrust for the US, which abandoned their country after enlisting it in a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Confronted with a choice between regressing to the stone age and meeting crazy Uncle Sam's demands, Musharraf's regime adopted a policy of dissembling that the then foreign minister outlined as \"First say yes, and later say but\". Since 9/11, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan's rogue spy agency, which has long considered Afghanistan as its backyard, has continued to provide sanctuary and military support for the Taliban while occasionally arresting some al-Qaida militants to appease Washington. Mullah Omar and the original Afghan Taliban Shura, Rashid claims, are serenely resident in Pakistan's borderlands, along with \"a plethora of Asian and Arab terrorist groups who are now expanding their reach into Europe and the United States\". </p> <p>\"I'm not,\" Bush said soon after 9/11, \"going to fire a $2m missile at a $10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt.\" Hitting camels in the butt may have been more useful than disbursing $70m in bribes to warlords such as Abdul Rashid Dostum, whom Rashid revealed in his previous book to be fond of driving tanks over his opponents. The US coaxed many of Afghanistan's old villains out of retirement to defeat the Taliban with minimum use of US troops, and then lost interest in the country.</p> <p>Rashid believes that the US could have done more to help \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan or at least prop up Hamid Karzai, who last week was reduced to plaintively asking Mullah Omar to return to Afghanistan for the sake of \"peace\". But as Tariq Ali bluntly clarifies in his new book The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power (Simon &amp; Schuster), the post-9/11 project of \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan, which prioritised western interests over all others, was always doomed. It was \"a top-down process\", trying to create \"an army constituted not to defend the nation but to impose order on its own people, on behalf of outside powers; a civil administration that will have no control over planning, health, education etc, all of which will be run by NGOs, whose employees will be far better paid than the locals, and answerable not to the population but to their overseas sponsors; and a government whose foreign policy is identical to Washington's.\"</p> <p>American bombing raids, which have killed hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan, further unite fractious Afghans against foreign usurpers. Tariq Ali correctly prescribes scepticism against strategists and journalists who blame Pakistan for increasing attacks on western forces in Afghanistan while disregarding the fact that \"many Afghans who detest the Taliban are so angered by the failures of Nato and the behaviour of its troops that they will support any opposition.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, too, public anger against the US is fuelled largely by the \"knowledge that Washington has backed every military dictator who has squatted on top of the country\". Contemptuously dismissing the alarmist clich\u00e9 that jihadis are very close to getting their grubby fingers on the country's nuclear button, Ali points to the deep and persistent unpopularity of religious parties in Pakistan. The jihadis would only get that far, he asserts, if \"the army wanted them to\", which is virtually impossible unless, as may be beginning to happen now, American assaults on the country's hard-won sovereignty causes deep ideological ruptures within the country's strongest institution.</p> <p>Filkins doesn't set out any future trajectory for the venture in Iraq. He reported from the country for the New York Times, but the first-person narrator of The Forever War is less a journalist than an existential hero, eloquent with the pathos of Sisyphean striving, impotence and failure. Composed in short, often lyrical, sections, Filkins's book often seems aimed at literary posterity, where it would join such modern classics of war literature as Ernst Junger's Storm of Steel, Andr\u00e9 Malraux's La Condition Humaine and Michael Herr's Dispatches</p> <p>Unlike the war in Vietnam, which exercised some of the keenest literary sensibilities in America (Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag), the entanglement in Iraq and Afghanistan has produced, so far at least, a meagre crop of quality journalism. The Forever War, which generally eschews historical overviews and extended analysis, succeeds more than most recent books in making cinematically vivid and imaginatively coherent the many places of horror and bewilderment that Americans have stumbled into during the \"war on terror\". This is what it is like - its brief confessions of doubt, confusion, panic and weariness seem to say - for an American young man witnessing the terrible violence of places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>Filkins has the exasperation of the well-travelled and atrocity-hardened journalist with his sheltered compatriots back home. The attack on the twin towers in New York makes him think that \"I was back in the third world ... My countrymen are going to think this is the end of the world, the worst thing that ever happened. In the third world this sort of thing happens every day.\" After the cyclone in Orissa, Filkins writes, \"the dead were piled so high and for so long that the dogs couldn't eat any more\". But as he strives to share with us the cruelty and tragedy of the world outside the west, he inadvertently reveals his historical innocence as well as hinting at a wider incomprehension of the postcolonial world and the decolonised mind. </p> <p>\"Do Americans imagine,\" Jonathan Schell once wrote, \"that the people of the world, having overthrown the territorial empires, are ready to bend the knee to an American overlord in the 21st?\" Even at his most tormented, Filkins doesn't really ask this crucial question, though he cannot help but be aware of the Iraqi people's eagerness to see the back of their \"liberators\" - to \"tell the Americans what they want to hear and they will go away, and we can carry on the way we want\". In a brilliantly paced account of Falluja, Filkins describes Iraqi children recoiling from American candy as if it were \"radioactive\" and remarks that the city \"was like that from the start, even before the big battle in November 2004. Anything the Americans tried there turned to dust.\" This may convey well to an American audience the frustration of their do-gooding representatives in Iraq who alternate bombs with candy. But Filkins would have advanced a greater appreciation of national or tribal feeling in Iraq if he had explained that residents of Falluja were equally intransigent in 1920, when the British imperial army had to destroy the city in order to save it. </p> <p>As perplexed as the British once were about Iraq (\"so complex, its ways so labyrinthine\"), Filkins writes with obvious fascination about Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi expatriate who managed to deceive some of the shrewdest politicians and journalists in America. In many ways, Chalabi, a chronic conspirator with mysterious allies in Iran, vindicates John Quincy Adams's warning to his young nation in 1821 against European-style imperialist adventures: by going \"abroad\", Adams wrote, \"in search of monsters to destroy\", America would \"involve herself beyond the power of extraction in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition\". But Chalabi, for Filkins, embodies Iraq's vexations rather than American blundering. \"When I looked,\" he writes, \"into Chalabi's eyes and saw the mirrors and doors closing, I knew that I was seeing not just the essence of the man but of the country to which he'd returned. L'etat c'est lui. Chalabi was Iraq.\" </p> <p>Whatever may be said about this amiable fraud, he was certainly not Iraq - the country he had barely set foot in for more than 40 years before the US invasion. Though easily the most original and intense American book yet on the war in Iraq, The Forever War is far from matching the stupendous achievement of Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie, which expresses more resonantly the American reporter's angst while ruthlessly investigating specific national flaws - racism, cold war paranoia, belief in technology - that entrapped the US in Vietnam. By abandoning the tasks of analysis and introspection, Filkins's book makes us suspect that the \"forever war\" might make a new generation of can-do Americans weary, but not wiser. </p> <p>\"I'd gotten caught up,\" he writes at one point, \"in the trappings and the pronouncements of officialdom, Iraqi and American.\" It is an admirably honest confession, but not one that the best US journalists covering their country's last big war would have made. Arriving in Vietnam in the early 1960s to report what was then a covert US operation, Homer Bigart, David Halberstam, Charley Mohr and Sheehan spent only a few weeks in the fog of official bluster. Their boldness was especially remarkable because the US media in the 1950s had largely shared a consensus about the dangers of communism with the White House and State Department, which regarded even newspapers such as the New York Times as extensions of foreign policy. </p> <p>Ignoring the adversarial standard set by Halberstam and Sheehan, many US journalists and commentators in the post-cold-war era have been too eager to uphold their government's claims. It is not clear if Filkins was one of the liberal interventionists with a naive faith in the Bush administration's promise to promote democracy through war. Certainly his frequent laments about the inept handling of the invasion and occupation of Iraq do not lead him to conclude that an intrinsically bad idea could have been handled much differently. He can also permit himself the belief that \"perhaps in the hideous present some larger good was being born\".</p> <p>This has the unfortunate echo of Condoleezza Rice's assertion, as Israel devastated Lebanon in 2006, that we were witnessing the \"birth pangs of a new Middle East\": that is, the Lebanese, bombed into a revolt against Hizbullah, would make their country safe for pro-Israeli and pro-American democracy. Totalitarian regimes and terrorist groups commonly use violence as a means to large-scale political engineering; it is more remarkable when democratic countries such as Israel and America do so, usually in flagrant disregard of the lessons of contemporary history. In A Choice of Enemies: America Confronts the Middle East (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), Lawrence Freedman describes in detail the awful results - the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, the rise of Hizbullah - of Israel's previous attempt in 1982 to redraw the map of the Middle East by assaulting Lebanon. </p> <p>It is one thing for a small country with a perennial existential crisis to believe that, as the Israeli general Moshe Dayan once put it, \"it was in our power to set a high price on our blood, a price too high for the Arab community, the Arab army or the Arab governments to think it worth paying\". But how did the US let its foreign policy become hostage to a strategy of pre-emptive war and brutal retaliation? \"How,\" Freedman asks, \"had the United States gotten itself in this position, entangled in the confusing and often violent geopolitics of the Middle East and beset by enemies on all sides.\"</p> <p>This is a bigger story than anyone can tell in one book, and the 600 pages of A Choice of Enemies cover only US foreign policy decisions from 1979, with the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Freedman is forced to skim some important details of the relationship between the US and Israel, whose continuing expansion into the occupied West Bank is probably the greatest source of the so-called Arab rage. The State Department in 1948 argued passionately against supporting a Jewish state in Palestine. The Eisenhower administration, which saw Israel as an irritant, undermining the US alliance with anti-Soviet regimes in the Middle East, ensured that the joint Anglo-French-Israeli attack on Egypt would fail. John F Kennedy sent feelers to Egypt's fiercely anti-Zionist president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Lyndon B Johnson was the first US president to manipulate foreign policy in order to bolster Jewish-American support for the Democratic party; but even he was not able to build his \"special relationship\" with Israel without encountering strong opposition from American diplomats. </p> <p>\"I could not believe what I was hearing,\" Jimmy Carter wrote in his diary after Menachem Begin confided in him his desire to reduce Palestinians on the West Bank to a minority. Even Ronald Reagan, who believed that God fixed the Middle East as the site of Armageddon, stuck to a cold war policy of close relations with reliably anti-Soviet and oil-rich Arab regimes. Friendly to Saudi Arabia, Bush Sr was actively hostile to Israeli expansionism. His secretary of state, James Baker, had only blunt wisdom (\"Forswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Reach out to Palestinians as neighbours who deserve political rights\") to impart to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful lobbying outfit for Israel, to which even Obama must now genuflect.</p> <p>Israel played a very small role in the blunders US administrations made in the late 1970s: to support the Shah of Iran long after his rule became widely despised and unsustainable, and, more fatefully, to mobilise a global Islamic jihad against Soviet communism. Trying to turn Afghanistan, as Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, exulted, into the \"Soviet Union's own Vietnam\", the CIA chose Pakistan as a logistical base for its anti-communist jihad. It funnelled money and arms to the ISI, which in turn passed on some of them to its own Islamist prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (some of whom are now fighting US and Nato troops in Afghanistan). Radicals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria and other Arab countries flocked to Pakistan to contribute to the holy war against atheistic communism. Freedman's statistics are a grim reminder of how the blowback from this first global jihad wrecked Pakistan long before it crashed into the west on September 11 2001. Pakistan, which had 900 religious schools in 1971, had \"about 8,000 official and as many as 25,000 unregistered madrassas\" by 1988. </p> <p>But if US officials noticed their indirect sponsorship of radical Islam, they did not care. As Freedman writes, \"the Reagan administration associated terrorism with leftist, secular groups linked to nationalist movements, whether the Irish, Basques or Palestinians ... Arab militants coming to support the jihad were seen at most as the equivalent of the idealists of the 1930s who joined the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war.\" </p> <p>Freedman recalls, too, some of the other political machinations that have come to haunt present generations: US support for Iraq in the latter's long war against Iran, which emboldened Saddam Hussein all through the 1980s, and the deliberate indifference to the victims of Iraq's chemical warfare. At least in these and other cynical moves, the US could claim the sanction of realpolitik. Great powers often have to make unpleasant choices to protect their interests; they have also been known occasionally to thrash (Reagan in Grenada, Putin in Georgia) a pesky neighbour or two. What is startlingly new is the Bush administration's experiment of intimidating entire peoples as well as governments in the Middle East into accepting America's worldwide hegemony. </p> <p>Seven years on, hundreds of thousands are dead, and millions of refugees on the move, while the US seems only to have boosted its old enemies in Afghanistan, Iran and Lebanon, and created formidable new ones in Iraq and Pakistan. In The War Within, Woodward shows the US president slipping deeper into his own world. \"We're killin' 'em! We're killin' 'em all!\" But not even the Bush administration, which has proved ready to do unspeakable things to its perceived enemies, can kill them all. It can continue to stage elaborate shock-and-awe spectacles, but if, as is increasingly evident, the target audience refuses to be impressed by them, they are rendered utterly futile - even dangerously counterproductive. \"Force,\" as James Baldwin pointed out in the early 1970s during the US bombing of Indochina, \"does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does. It does not, for instance, reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary and this revelation invests the victim with patience.\"</p> <p>Apparently routed by heavy B-52 bombing in 2001, the Taliban are resurgent, straining the military resources of the US and Nato in Afghanistan to the limit. In Iraq the strategy based on overwhelming force has proved to be a catastrophic failure, and had to be replaced by General David Petraeus's new counter-insurgency doctrine that emphasises political over military tactics. Nevertheless, McCain pledges \"victory\" in Iraq, whatever that takes, including a 100-year-long military presence in the country; threatening Russia, he also seems ready to bomb Iran. Obama, though keen to withdraw troops from Iraq, upholds the complacently bipartisan consensus about Afghanistan. But more US troops in the Pashtun heartland may merely underscore the lesson learned at a terrible cost by the British army in 1839-42 and 1878-80, and the Soviet army in 1979-89. \"A troop increase,\" Rory Stewart recently reiterated in Time magazine, \"is likely to inflame Afghan nationalism because Afghans are more anti-foreign than we acknowledge, and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining.\" The violation of Pakistan's sovereignty threatens to be the most calamitous of recent US misadventures. </p> <p>A gracious acceptance of the limits of US firepower may not be forthcoming from the next administration, which will face the hard choice to get out or fight on. Indeed, failure may make it even more determined to maintain the pride of US arms and the image of the mightiest power on earth. The prospect of humiliation in Vietnam was what prompted Nixon's devastation of Cambodia, setting the stage for the genocidal Pol Pot. As Hannah Arendt wrote, \"when all signs pointed to defeat\", the goal was \"no longer one of avoiding humiliating defeat but of finding ways and means to avoid admitting it and 'save face'.\" </p> <p>Could smashing up Iran or invading Pakistan become the face-saving formula for the exponents of \"shock and awe\"? Certainly, they see US force impressing the Persian and the Pakistani mind as it apparently has the Arab mind. And such is the crazy logic of a wounded militarism that, notwithstanding its battered economy, the US may soon be embattled on many more fronts in what is already its most damaging war.</p>",

He said it was \"inevitable\" more firms would run into trouble. \"This past week has been about as bad as it could get,\" he said. \"People are very worried and have no real idea what the future might look like\".</p> <p>The combined assets of Iceland's big three banks are nine times the country's GDP.

  "<p>Andy Dawson will take a deep breath in the White Hart Lane tunnel tomorrow and then glance to one side. He has visualised the scenario countless times, particularly since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity\">Hull City</a>'s promotion to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, but when he sets eyes on his younger brother Michael, in the white of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, the emotions will churn. \"It's the sort of thing that we'll look back on more fondly afterwards but, of course, it will be a very proud moment,\" he said. \"I was saying to my wife, though, that when I shake hands with Mike, I won't know what to say.\" </p> <p>The memories will flash before him, freeze frames from their childhood in Leyburn, north Yorkshire; the time that they spent together at Nottingham Forest, along with their middle brother Kevin; the highs and lows from their careers that they have shared with each other. </p> <p>For a split second, Andy will be transported back to the family home and those endless kickabouts in the back garden. Michael will be, too. \"I remember one Christmas, we had goals bought for us,\" smiled Andy. \"We'd play for hours. One of us crossing, one finishing and one in goal. It would be Kev crossing, me smacking shots into the top corner and Mike in net. The youngest always gets stuck in goal.\" </p> <p>The age of innocence contrasts sharply with the world that they now inhabit, one of big bucks and stifling pressure. Their boyhood dreams of cracking English football's top flight did not factor in the gargantuan excesses of the Premier League. Yet the Dawsons have retained both exuberance and gravitas. </p> <p>Michael has the \u00a34m transfer from Forest to one of London's glamour clubs behind him, he almost forced his way into Sven-Goran Eriksson's England squad for the last World Cup and he is widely recognisable but you will never hear him acting the big-shot. \"It's the way we've been brought up,\" said Andy. \"He wouldn't be allowed to get away with that.\" </p> <p>Andy, meanwhile, has taken a more circuitous route to the top division. Having spent the majority of his 11-season career in the lower leagues with Scunthorpe United and Hull, after making only one first-team appearance for Forest, the 29-year-old readily admits that he is living the dream. There have been high points already, not least his visit to north London last weekend, when the left-back subdued Theo Walcott and crossed for Daniel Cousin to head the winner that rocked Arsenal and the Emirates Stadium. </p> <p>If few people foresaw Tottenham's dire start to the season, which has them bottom of the league without a victory, then Hull's surge to 11 points and sixth place has confounded all expectations. Andy describes the club's three promotions in five seasons as the stuff of \"fairytale\" yet he always believed that they were destined for great things.</p> <p>\"I will never forget the day I signed from Scunthorpe [in the summer of 2003],\" he said. \"I walked around the KC Stadium, which had been completed six months previously, with the manager Peter Taylor and he talked about the massive ambitions that the club had. He said that they had to get out of League Two that season and keep going, and it went as he planned.\"</p> <p>Andy also knew that Michael, from an early age, was destined for the top. Although he had left Forest by the time that Michael, who is five years his junior, started to establish himself at centre-half, he heard the reports about his brother's swift progress from old friends. \"Me and Kev went to watch him play at Stoke, he would have been 18, but he was spraying balls everywhere,\" Andy said. \"From then, you think 'He has got a chance'.\" </p> <p>The brothers have travelled in support of each other whenever they can. \"When I was nine years old and playing for Leyburn,\" said Andy, \"Kev and Mike would be trailing behind. When Kev started playing, it would be Mike trailing behind.\" </p> <p>Kevin, 27, and Michael were at Wembley in May 1999, when Andy's Scunthorpe team beat Leyton Orient in the League Two play-off final and they were back there last May, for Hull's Championship play-off triumph over Bristol City. The boys credit their father Stuart, a former player who had trials for Manchester United, with being a great influence on their careers and with their mother Yvonne, he will take his seat at White Hart Lane. So will Kevin, who played for Chesterfield after leaving Forest and now turns out for Worksop Town in the UniBond Premier Division, while working as a community coach for Middlesbrough. Andy's wife Lisa and their two young sons will be there as well. </p> <p>\"We're a close family,\" said Andy, who can recall fraternal dust-ups but always felt protective towards his younger brothers. \"Mind you,\" he continued, \"they're protective of me now they are bigger. I stand behind them on nights out.\" </p> <p>The summer before last, the brothers went for a drink in Scunthorpe to celebrate the birth of Andy's second son. Michael had to oblige the autograph hunters. \"It must be difficult for him,\" said Andy, \"but he takes things in his stride.\" </p> <p>On what promises to be a slightly surreal occasion tomorrow, that will be the challenge for both of them.</p> <h2>When one tribe goes to war</h2> <p><strong>Bobby and Jack Charlton</strong></p> <p>The World Cup-winning siblings added spice to many a Manchester United v Leeds encounter in the 1960s and 70s, overshadowing the other family rivalry on show in many of those matches, as Johnny Giles came up against his brother-in-law, Nobby Stiles.</p> <p><strong>Alan and Gary Kelly</strong></p> <p>When Preston beat Bury 2-1 in the old Third Division in 1990 both teams had a Kelly in goal while another, their father Alan Sr, watched from the stands.

She is a humble 18-year-old with a devastating sprint and a million dollars in the bank.</p> <p>In the two weeks since returning home from a season where she not only won the 800m Olympic title but also scooped all the lucrative Golden League athletics jackpot, Pamela Jelimo has met the president and been flown by helicopter to a huge homecoming parade. In a first for a Kenyan runner, she has received a diplomatic passport and even had a street named after her.</p> <p>In Kapsabet, the nearest town to her Rift Valley village, the government has erected a giant billboard. Newspapers track her every move, on the front page and the back. But while the Olympic victory, remarkably the first by a Kenyan woman, is being lauded, the $1m (\u00a3560,000) prize for remaining unbeaten in European competition appears to have attracted as much attention - and caused controversy. </p> <p>At least three coaches are claiming credit for nurturing Jelimo's career. Several men are claiming to be Jelimo's father, breaking cultural norms and enraging her mother. And others in the lush, tea-growing area that has produced so many athletics greats, from 1960s Olympian Kip Keino to current London marathon champion Martin Lel, are dreaming of wedding bells.</p> <p>Marcel Kipkorir, a 21-year-old man who went to primary school with Jelimo in Koyo village, said: \"Guys want her now because of her fat wallet.\"</p> <p>The fascination with her prize has grown so acute that Jelimo, who a year ago was struggling to pay off her school fees, has appeared overwhelmed. \"Don't ask about the money,\" she told journalists last week in one of her few public statements.</p> <p><strong>'Married at home'</strong></p> <p>Her rags-to-riches tale is even more remarkable considering her family's background. Her running genes come from her mother, Esther Cheptoo Keter, a once-promising athlete whose path in life was dictated by the customs of her Nandi ethnic group.</p> <p>As the last-born daughter, Keter was not allowed to take a husband. Deemed \"married at home\", she was required to look after her parents as they got old - although she was allowed to have children by different men. Essentially a single mother, she always struggled to educate her children, including Jelimo, the third of nine siblings.</p> <p>By secondary school in 2003, the \"shy girl\" was showing great potential as an athlete. Her games teacher, Philip N'geno, said she excelled at sprinting and pushed herself by training with boys. \"I was afraid to run alongside her, because for a boy to be beaten by a girl is very shameful,\" said Eric Rugut in Koyo this week.</p> <p>The family's money problems meant that she was regularly sent home from school for failing to pay fees but was always allowed back because of her prowess at athletics. Daniel Maru, the headteacher at Koyo secondary school, who permitted Jelimo to graduate while still owing more than a year's fees, said that her mother had had to sell her last cow to enable Jelimo to sit her exams. </p> <p>It was a risky investment, as the mother acknowledged to Maru, for there was no guarantee that Jelimo would find a job after school - and there seemed little likelihood of a lucrative running career. Even a 400m win at the African junior championships last year caused no great interest, for while Kenyan girls have often won world titles they have never translated that dominance at senior level - unlike Ethiopia, the country's main rival on the track. </p> <p>But Jelimo, who has an unusually powerful build for a middle-distance runner, proved spectacularly different. In April she ran her first 800m and went on to win all 12 events she entered this year, including all six Golden League events - something no Kenyan man has done. In Zurich in August, she ran the third-fastest 800m ever, coming within a second of breaking the 25-year-old world record. Her rivals rarely finished within a few metres of her.</p> <p>Mike Kosgei, a former national team coach, said he had seen a sharp rise in the number of local girls training since Jelimo's win in Beijing and described her achievements as akin to winning the Nobel prize. \"Olympic champion and jackpot winner! It's amazing!\"</p> <p>Jelimo has built her mother a brick house, near the family's old round hut. The state power company has promised to connect it to the national grid. But her mother's proud moment has been somewhat ruined by reports of different men claiming to be Jelimo's father. One of them, John Busienei, told reporters: \"She [Jelimo] is my daughter and I love her so much\". He was speaking at her parade, where men held up \"Marry me\" placards. Another alleged father, Charles Kibiwott Bungei, a 62-year-old former teacher, said: \"She is my true girl.\"</p> <p>When the Guardian went to her home this week, her mother exclaimed angrily: \"I am the mother and father of Jelimo!\"</p> <p>Success, it seems, always has its price.</p>",
  "<p>Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9, the trainer of Zarkava, the unbeaten favourite for tomorrow's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, said yesterday that he has no concerns about her draw in stall one in a 16-strong field.</p> <p>In France, horses are installed in numerical order, which means Zarkava, who was very slowly away last time out, will have to stand and wait while the rest of the field goes in.</p> <p>However, de Royer-Dupr\u00e9 does not believe this will diminish her chance. \"There is no problem with that draw,\" he said yesterday. \"Inside is usually the best in the Arc, and she has never been a filly who is difficult at the stalls. It was strange that she was left in the stalls in the Vermeille because she had never done that before, at home or on a racecourse.</p> <p>\"The good thing was that she did it in her prep race and not in the Arc. She looks very well and worked well in the week. All we can hope for now is a bit of luck and not too much rain, that is the main thing.\"</p> <p>Rain is also a concern to the connections of Duke Of Marmalade, who is drawn in stall 14, two from the outside. \"At the moment, we want to run the two of them [Duke Of Marmalade and Soldier Of Fortune],\" John Magnier, the owner of Coolmore Stud, said yesterday. \"We want to run, but we won't decide until closer to the time,\" he added.</p> <p>Magnier has another ball to juggle in the big juvenile championship races after the comprehensive success of Bushranger in the Group One Middle Park Stakes here yesterday. Johnny Murtagh was always going well on the winner, who quickened well to beat Sayif nearly two lengths.</p> <p>Unlike most of the Coolmore operation's horses, Bushranger is trained by David Wachman, Magnier's son-in-law. \"There's a lot of horses that need to run, so we'll have to see how things work out, but there's plenty of options for him,\" Wachman said.</p> <p>The wealth of options available to the Irish operation is demonstrated by the fact that Bushranger is unchanged at 16-1 with Hill's for next year's 2,000 Guineas. Only two horses, Mastercraftsman at 5-1 and Rip Van Winkle at 6-1, are in single figures, and both are Coolmore-owned.</p> <p>The Group One Cheveley Park Stakes looked very open on paper, with 16 fillies going to post and the favourite trading at 4-1. It was the market leader that obliged, though, as Rae Guest's Serious Attitude travelled smoothly through the first five furlongs before quickening to lead along the far rail.</p> <p>Jimmy Fortune, Serious Attitude's jockey, kept punching through the closing stages and the winner ran on bravely in response. Aspen Darling and Pursuit Of Glory made little impression on her lead in the closing stages and she went on to win by half a length and three quarters.</p> <p>Coral took the most aggressive approach to her 1,000 Guineas odds, and cut Serious Attitude to 10-1, second only to Rainbow View, the 5-2 favourite. VCBet, though, offer 20-1 (from 33-1) and there is plenty of 16-1 available with high-street bookies.</p> <p>\"This is what you do it for, it's what you get up in the morning for,\" Guest said. \"My Emma won the Vermeille and the Yorkshire Oaks about 10 years ago, and that's a long time to go without a Group One winner, but not when you only have 15 yearlings each year.\"</p> <p>Aidan O'Brien is rightly regarded as a trainer who gets the best from his horses, but even he can let the odd one slip by. Eagle Mountain, who finished second to Authorized in the Derby last year, left Ballydoyle to join Mike de Kock, and won the Group Three Joel Stakes on his first run for the South African trainer.</p> <p>Eagle Mountain beat the old track record for the Rowley Mile by nearly half a second, coming with an impeccably timed run under Kevin Shea. \"That was more than I expected after being out for a year,\" Shea said. \"I'm excited by him.\"</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <p><strong>Kasbah Bliss</strong> 2.55 Longchamp</p> <p>The Prix du Cadran, one of three Longchamp races shown live on BBC2, provided an upset last year when Yeats was beaten at odds-on. His chance may be better this year, as connections bypassed the Irish St Leger this time, but Kasbah Bliss will be no pushover. Francois Doumen's smart hurdler impressed when winning last month's Prix Gladiateur here by six lengths.</p>",
  "<p>A week in, there seems to be consensus over what Joe Kinnear can hope to bring to Newcastle United during his six-game spell of New Deal Senior Jobseeker workplace experience. \"Joe can give us a thing or two,\" Michael Owen said. \"The first thing I would suggest is confidence.\" For Harry Redknapp \"self-belief is the key\" and \"one thing Joe is good at is motivating players\". So there you have it. Much like the violently convulsing global economy, it's all about confidence. Newcastle don't have any. Can Kinnear get them some? And if so, how quickly?</p> <p>This is a question football has wrestled with for some time, usually in relation to scoring goals. The most common theory is that a player low on confidence \"just needs one to go in off his backside\". The mechanics of this are not entirely clear. Neurological research has suggested sudden impact to the backside may affect the part of the brain that controls the vital weak-dink-at-the-keeper reflex. Others maintain this is a purely sensual response to the comforting slap of ball on buttock.</p> <p>There are also complications. We are told that success breeds confidence. At the same time, confidence breeds success. Confidence also breeds confidence. And of course, nothing breeds success like success. In football circles this kind of reasoning is usually described as ontologically reductive - or, in plain philosophy-speak, a right load of tosh. For the time being, Kinnear simply doesn't have time to unravel these kind of semantic conundrums. </p> <p>Luckily, some believe confidence can be produced in other ways - mainly by employing a \"big personality\". </p> <p>Managers with big personalities radiate confidence. Terry Venables can \"lift a club just by walking through the door\", smiling, waving and wearing a tracksuit. Graham Taylor did it by appearing on the touchline, revolving his arms and blowing out his chest like an excited gorilla. The results spoke for themselves. </p> <p>Does Kinnear have a big personality? At Wimbledon he found a niche as a straight-talking, get-it-in-the-mixer-early-doors sergeant major type. Almost a decade on, it's hard to remember specifically what brand of edgy, maverick charisma he might bring to the St James' Park dressing room. </p> <p>In the interests of journalistic rigour, then, a cursory flick through Hunter Davies's 1972 book The Glory Game, in which Kinnear appears as a Tottenham player, provides the following profile. His interests were \"tennis, clothes and pop music\". His pre-match superstition involved not putting his shorts on until the last moment - \"until then I walk around in my jock strap\". And after retiring he thought he might do \"something in fashion\". </p> <p>Plenty to work on there, you'd have thought. And if, on this occasion, getting someone in to stroll about in his jockstrap, listening to Rod Stewart, waving a tennis racket and talking about opening a boutique doesn't quite do the job confidence-wise, the club can always fall back on the emergency tactic currently being put to good use by the convulsing global economy: the massive, non-refundable cash injection. </p> <p>Come to think of it, maybe it would be best just to have a check of the exact figures with those Nigerian chaps.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 David Cameron told the Tory conference: \"Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first-aid officer.\" The image of an urchin suffering while a heartless, bureaucracy-gone-mad nanny state makes him wait for help sent shudders through the conference. Except it's not true. There is no rule or law that says any such thing. No doubt there are guidelines - a teacher may need to know if the child is allergic - but any responsible adult can clean a cut and pop a plaster on it without being sued for malpractice or suspected of child molestation. You can check out similar myths on <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk\">hse.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>We all get caught by these yarns (Punch and Judy banned; no Christmas lights) especially if we're told by people we trust. Or even see them in newspapers. But you'd think a party leader would check before including it in his main speech of the year. I suppose it could have been worse. At least he didn't tell us that the EU wants to ban British sausages, or to demand straight cucumbers.</p> <p>\u2022 It was fun to go back to Birmingham where I lived, ages ago. Like many cities once sniggered at but now more highly esteemed, it is, perhaps, not quite as exciting and throbbingly up to date as it imagines. Yes, the centre with its open spaces and superb municipal buildings are wonderful, but many of the modern buildings are so hideous that Stalin would have rejected them - ghastly, life-destroying rectangles of stained concrete. And the parts that aren't pedestrianised are trafficised, so you can spend hours trying to get to somewhere as visible but inaccessible as the moon. I spoke to a man who was almost in tears. He had tried every way he could to get his hotel, just across the street, but failed each time. In the end he bravely set off in exactly the opposite direction, since that was the only route he hadn't tried.</p> <p>In the square they had built an artificial beach for the public to enjoy. It was about half the size of a football pitch, with 100 deckchairs, a bar and sponsors' branding. In the four days of the conference, including two sunny ones, I saw not one single person sitting there. It was sad rather than surreal. Someone must have once thought it was a really good idea.</p> <p>But the pre-Raphaelites in the art gallery are worth the price of the train fare alone. Alongside The Last of England, The Blind Girl and other great works, it has interesting lesser paintings. One I'd never seen was The Boer War by John Byam Shaw, painted in 1901. At first it's a puzzle, because instead of pounding horses and blood-soaked veldt, it shows a sunlit English meadow. A handsome woman stands by a pond. Her hand is up to her mouth, indicating sorrow. Her husband or fiance has been killed, so the title has a bitter rather than heroic resonance. Presumably she has returned to one of their favourite places. It's deeply sentimental, but I'm a sucker for all that.</p> <p>Yet there is a harsher edge. It's as if the artist has said: \"Look, I know she's grieving, but look how beautifully I've done these daisies, and haven't the reeds come up a treat!\" In the same way the landscape behind Millais's girl is so improbably gorgeous the painting seems cruel rather than just poignant. She wouldn't have missed half as much if he'd stuck her by New Street station.</p> <p>\u2022 Great to hear one of my favourite cartoonists, Bill Tidy, on the radio this week, and to see some of his work in the huge new collection The Best of Punch Cartoons (Prion, \u00a330 - not bad for 2,000 jokes.) Some of his classics are sadly missing: I loved the stationmaster in his top hat inspecting a wrecked railway carriage, all slashed seats and broken windows. \"That does it. No more royal trains!\" Or the operating theatre. The patient is fleeing in panic as policemen dash in through another door. \"Don't worry, officer,\" says the surgeon. \"He won't get far without a heart.\" There was always conflict on the old Punch between the writers, who regarded cartoons as frivolous decorations, and the artists, who believed their drawings were the only reason people bought the magazine.</p> <p>The last, pre-Fayed editor, tried to get the cartoonists onside with a piss-up. It didn't work. Bill fixed him with a ferocious pair of eyes, and an even more ferocious moustache, and growled contemptuously: \"You! Yer cartoon-blind!\"</p>",
  "<h2>The first president of the USA</h2> <p>Have you heard anyone recently talking about Barack Obama and John McCain?</p> <p>They are currently running to be elected as president of the United States of America. Americans \"run\" for elections. The British \"stand\" for elections. I wonder why that is.</p> <p>The election is going to take place at the beginning of November.</p> <p>Barack Obama is the first African American to be a presidential nominee [NOM-EE-KNEE] for a major party. </p> <p>The first president of the USA was George Washington. Ask your teacher if they remember George Washington.</p> <h2>The last state to join the Union</h2> <p>America is made up of 50 states. That's why it's called the United States of America. States have their own governments.</p> <p>Here is an alphabetical list of the first 10 states of America: Alabama; Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Florida; Georgia.</p> <p>Can you find out the names of the other 40 states of the USA?</p> <p>The last state to join the Union was Hawaii, in 1959. Hawaii is an archipelago (an ARK-E-PEL-AGO). An archipelago is a group of islands.</p> <p>Hawaii is not even in North America. It's in the Pacific Ocean. So, as they say in America - go figure.</p> <h2>The biggest state in America</h2> <p>The biggest state in America is absolutely huge. And freezing cold. It's Alaska.</p> <p>Alaska is massively massive. It covers more than 650,000 square miles. Which is twice the size of Texas, which is also massive.</p> <p>According to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Alaska has 3m lakes! But not many people: only 700,000.</p> <p>Alaska exports mostly oil, gas, salmon, cod and crab. And politicians.</p> <p>John McCain - remember him up in \"the first\"? - is running for the presidential election with someone called Sarah Palin (she's his \"running mate\"). Sarah Palin is the first woman to be chosen as a presidential running mate. She's from Alaska.</p> <h2>The smallest state in America</h2> <p>The smallest state in America is Rhode Island. It's not an island, but it does contains islands. Rhode Island is tiny. It covers just 1,545 square miles.</p> <p>Even though it's small it has the longest name of all the states of the USA. Its official name is The State of Rhode Island and the Providence Plantations. It's sometimes called the Ocean State (it's by the ocean). Or Little Rhody.</p> <p>Rhode Island is famous for its gangsters and also for its special hot dogs, called \"Hot Wieners\" or \"New York System Wieners\", which are basically mini-hot dogs covered with a meat sauce and onions. Delicious! (Unless you're an American vegetarian).</p> <h2>The best thing about America</h2> <p>It's difficult to judge what's absolutely the best thing about America - I'm not American.</p> <p>But here are some pretty good things about America: Thanksgiving, the New York Public Library, drive-in cinemas, baseball, The Simpsons, hamburgers, cheeseburgers (not if you're a vegetarian, obviously).</p> <p>Are you an actual real live American? Were you born in America? Have you lived in America? Is your mum, your dad, your brother, your sister, your uncle, your aunt, or your granny or your grandad American?</p> <p>If so, email <a href=\"mailto:extreme.facts@theguardian.com\">extreme.facts@theguardian.com</a> and tell us what you think the best thing is.</p> <h2>The worst thing about America</h2> <p>This is even trickier than deciding what's the best thing about America. </p> <p>I mean, how would you like it if someone came to your town, or your street, or your house and said \"I don't like this. I don't like that.\" You'd be annoyed and upset, right?</p> <p>Well, it's the same with someone else's country. So I'm not even going to begin to say what's the worst thing about America. Although I must admit I don't like guns and, unlike in the UK, in America it's quite legal to own a gun.</p>",
  "<p>When I began interviewing manual, clerical and sales workers in the 1970s, what most struck me was how much they personalise their experiences on the job, in contrast to their European equivalents. Americans view where they stand in society as a barometer of who they are as individuals, while Europeans tend to put more distance between their personal life and the circumstances of their jobs. This difference has remained throughout all the changes in the economy, patterns of migration and the loss of many American jobs overseas in the past 30 years.</p> <p>Taking class personally has positive and negative sides. On the positive side it means taking responsibility for how you live, even for conditions beyond your control; thus working-class Americans tend to dislike the welfare state much more than Europeans; self-respect comes through taking care of yourself. The negative side is that the people I've lived with and studied are subject to strong feelings of shame when they do in fact need help. </p> <p>As inequality increased in the United States over the past decade, it was still possible to consume your way into the sense of holding your own as an equal to more affluent people, particularly by buying a house. But today the economic meltdown has put an end to that. More deeply rooted in our history, American workers have been super-sensitive to \"elitism\". It is a code word not for the stinking rich but for the self-sufficient; for people with the education, social contacts, tastes and manners that make them not only self-sufficient but also apparently self-satisfied. What I've tried to show in my books is that, while working-class people seldom speak openly about being left out or left behind, they feel invidious comparison and personal exclusion deeply - and this is where politics enters the picture.</p> <p>The problem Senator Obama faces is that everything about his life story - his origins as an outsider, his academic achievements, his decision to eschew making money in order to lend a helping hand to the poor - reads as a positive to working-class negatives. His life story seems to put ordinary people to shame, and the more he repeats this story, the more they manage shame - as we all do - through anger and resentment.</p> <p>One thing I've learned about political messages targeted at the working class is that declaring \"the system has screwed you\" is likely to backfire. It casts the listener into the role of victim, a role which workers find demeaning. Better crafted political language is more impersonal, as in \"there's something wrong with the system\"; such messages treat everyone as in the same boat.</p> <p>One issue the Obama campaign needs to think through is that the mantra of \"change you can believe in\" runs up against a streak of fatalism in the American working class. This fatalism has a particular cast. Lower-level workers tend to be treated on the job as invisible. The centre-left agenda for reform has seldom focused on such bread-and-butter issues as better vocational schools, insurance against industrial accidents, or skills-development programmes for salesmen, secretaries and clerks; these issues don't register on the political radar just because they are so ordinary, so boring, so unexciting. The fatalism of American workers emerges as a result: those who say they are on your side don't see you.</p> <p>The right has done nothing more substantial for these workers, but it has offered two cultural substitutes: nationalism and nostalgia. To make \"change you can believe in\" credible, the changes have to be more concrete.</p> <p>I've left for last the issue of race. Working-class racism is a complex issue, in large part today because the poles of white and black no longer chart it - \"non-white\" has become a very mixed category. Many white and Latino workers certainly harbour negative feelings about African Americans, but these are different sorts of negatives. The familiar story is that many whites believe that the dramatic claims blacks have made on the American upper-middle class have gained them unfair privileges; what's perhaps less apparent is that many Latino Americans reproach blacks for a supposed lack of family solidarity. However, these prejudices do not reign over the behaviour of working-class people when on the job; for instance, there are far fewer racial incidents at work than there were a generation ago. </p> <p>Which may be of little comfort to Senator Obama. Prejudice in America certainly exists, and it will be hard for him to remove the public's mask of not caring about race. It's for this reason that he ought deal with race in the same way as with class, focusing on what workers do, rather than on who they are.</p> <p><em>Richard Sennett is Centennial professor of sociology at LSE and author of The Craftsman</em></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338274269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The White House's $700bn bail-out for the banking industry became law last night after a week of persuasion, negotiation and horse-trading prompted Congress to reverse its opposition to the plan.</p> <p>In a vote watched anxiously by Wall Street, the House of Representatives backed the rescue plan by a comfortable margin of 263 to 171. The vote overturned Monday's shock result in which lawmakers opposed it 228 to 205. </p> <p>The bill, which allows the US treasury to clean up banks' balance sheets by purchasing distressed mortgage-backed securities, was signed by George Bush within hours of congressional approval. But the vote failed to prevent the worst week on Wall Street for seven years which ended with a slide in stocks as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 157 points to 10,325 amid dire economic news.</p> <p>Bush said it had been a tough week. \"There were moments this week when some thought the federal government could not rise to the challenge,\" he said.</p> <p>Thanking leaders of both parties for rallying support, he said: \"By coming together on this legislation, we have acted boldly to prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country.\" Business leaders hope the rescue package will thaw frozen credit markets and restore confidence in struggling banks. It includes measures to limit pay for senior banking executives and to increase the insured limit of US bank balances from $100,000 to $250,000. The treasury is likely to begin buying banks' assets this week.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve's chairman, welcomed the plan's approval. \"The legislation is a critical step toward stabilizing our financial markets and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of credit to households and businesses,\" he said.</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents business leaders, said: \"With the American economy on life support, Congress took the necessary step to stop the bleeding.\"</p> <p>About 40 members of the House of Representatives changed their vote to support the plan, alarmed by jittery markets and by deteriorating economic conditions. Official figures released yesterday showed the worst drop in US employment for five years as 159,000 people disappeared from payrolls last month. </p> <p>John Lewis, a Democrat who switched sides, said: \"I have decided that the cost of doing nothing is greater than the cost of doing something.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama and John McCain supported the package despite an estimated $100bn of tax credits added to win support from waverers. These included aid for special interests including Hollywood film studios and for the manufacturers of children's wooden arrows.</p> <p>Steny Hoyer, the Democratic leader in the House, said: \"The American people expected us to act, to respond to the best extent we could, to stop the downward flow in the markets .\"</p> <p>There has been a dismal flow of negative financial news throughout the week including a slump in factory orders and a steady decline in house prices. John Silvia, chief US economist at the banking group Wachovia, said all the indicators pointed to a likely shrinking in the US economy in the final quarter of the year. \"You put the whole package together and basically, we're in a recession. What more can you say?\" he said.</p> <p>Wall Street's eye on Congress has caused difficulties in recent days. The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, caused a sell-off in insurance shares by suggesting that an unnamed \"major insurance company\" was \"on the verge of going bankrupt\" because of delays to the bail-out, which is designed to aid the financial sector by mopping up toxic securities from struggling banks.</p> <p>Critics of the bail-out still have reservations. Some have pounced on an apparent admission by the treasury that the figure of $700bn to buy up securities was arbitrary. Forbes magazine quoted a treasury spokeswoman saying that it was not based on any particular data point: \"We just wanted to choose a really large number.\"</p> <p>Such is the freeze on funding that the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his state may need a loan of up to $7bn from the federal government to plug a gap caused by the credit crunch. \"California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury ...\" he said.</p>",

When the market reaches bottom, it won't head back up immediately; instead, it will move sideways for a number of months before a gradual recovery starts.<br>(Alvin Hall is the author of a new book, Show Me The Money)</p> <h2>Michael Coogan - Director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338261193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/10/03/coogan220.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Coogan of the CML\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>Continuing to invest normally for the long term, but cutting back on discretionary spending. In reality, it is my wife who controls the spending. She loves to help M&amp;S buck the retail trend.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>No regrets, but my investment in timeshares has had less of a return as holidays abroad have been curtailed this year. I am glad we invested in the very large plasma TV with HD. It brings Robert Peston's ties to life.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>In the spring, I suggested that sticking cash in the mattress would help to firm it up and provide a good night's sleep. Now it would be investing in any institution with a government guarantee for its deposits. Having cash readily available is the key now.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Michael Jackson could write a song about it. But, with cross political party peace breaking out, and the tripartite authorities speaking with a single voice, we should avoid the chaos that has beset the United States.</p> <h2>Andrew Verity - Presenter BBC Radio 5 Live Wake Up to Money</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>I sold my maisonette nearly four years ago, deciding to wait and rent until prices came off so we would eventually be able to afford a bigger place. We put the money on deposit to generate interest and help pay the rent on a new place. I can afford much more space for the same money renting than I would have done if I'd bought. Initially the money was all with one institution. But after Northern Rock last year I decided it would be better to spread it out between different accounts. The other reason renting can be a good idea is that you save a fortune on repairs to boilers, walls, roofs and the like.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>No. Apart from the \u00a3750 I spent fixing my car, a Skoda Octavia, which I bought because I thought it would have a reliable VW engine. I suppose it was a worthwhile investment. But spending the money felt horrible.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>If it were last year - and this is just a personal view - I would have said sell your house, put your money on deposit and rent for a while. Apart from the safety, the psychological benefit of having money on deposit is huge. You are also much more flexible if you need to move. But my top investment tip is actually rather boring. Pay off your debts. It's one of very few investments that is totally tax exempt and you also get a guaranteed rate of return.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Why bad? If you're talking about unemployment, that's bad - the most devastating thing that can happen to you financially, apart from divorce or serious illness. But if you stay in work, there are lots of things that are good financially. House prices are coming down. That's good for anyone who either has never been able to afford one or who wants to trade up. It's only bad for those who've been wrongly relying on their house price as an index of wealth. Where else do we talk about prices coming down as \"bad\"? Clothes are getting cheaper, so's technology. And with the slowdown now underway across the world, petrol should get cheaper. On the other hand, taxes may have to go up sharply to pay for tax credits for all those people who are going to become reliant on them to get by. That could be serious.</p> <h2>David Hollingworth - Head of communications at London &amp; Country</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338260982\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/02/29/david-hollingworthc.jpg\" alt=\"David Hollingworth\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>My money has stayed exactly where it was. I am, however, concentrating on putting more money towards my mortgage, having taken on a new one last summer before the bedlam commenced. I'm therefore keen to put as much towards it to capitalise on the attractive rate and ease the situation when the rate inevitably lifts.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>I have no regrets other than perhaps not bagging a load of HBOS shares when they hit 88p! Having bought a new property last summer, I could fret about the fact that prices have been on the decline since, but I'm actually very happy with the purchase as a home for the long term. The fact that I was a seller too meant I also sold at the top of the market, and any equity gain on the sale was shifted into the purchase.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>Make sure you shop across the mortgage market and if possible reduce your mortgage debt rather than increase it. When remortgaging, be realistic on the value of your property. We see regular down-valuations, and that can have a big impact on the best product available.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Mortgage rates available now are already substantially higher than only a year or so ago. With continuing turmoil it's hard to see an end in sight, and with funding costs still unstable, I'm afraid the market could well get tougher before it improves. However, I believe most people will still be able to get a mortgage - it's all a question of at what rate.</p> <h2>Paul Lewis - Presenter of Money Box on BBC Radio 4</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>Paying off debt.

But if I were to write about it, I would say \"cash\".</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Worse. Perhaps much worse.</p> <h2>Karren Brady - Managing director of Birmingham City FC</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>My money is evenly spread in relatively low-risk investments. But who would have thought that of all the things we have to worry about in this world, we'd lie awake at night wondering if our money is safe in the bank! I cannot perceive a situation where one of the high street retail banks like NatWest or HSBC goes under. I think there would be rioting on the streets, so I am not moving my money out of NatWest. I've had the same bank account for 23 years! However, I think the government should do exactly what the Irish government has done for their banks and announce that all deposits in all major UK banks are underwritten. People say this would cost trillions but the reality is that it would cost nothing. Banks trade on confidence, and confidence would be restored.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>I bought some Tesco and Next shares - both have taken a dip, but I am a long-term holder. The most shares I have are in Mothercare where I am on the board, and I recently bought more.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>I believe high street banks are fine for savings, although with the current unlimited guarantee of your savings from Irish banks, it must be worth considering. For smaller cash holdings (up to \u00a330,000), premium bonds are good and very safe. In terms of shares I would buy the main bank shares as I really don't think they can go any lower - although I did think that three months ago!</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>A lot depends on the government. They really need to guarantee everyone's deposits at all the major banks and then the problem is solved. If they don't do this, things will get worse before they get better.</p> <h2>Sarah Beeny - TV presenter and property expert</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>Most of our assets are in property and always have been, as that's what I know about. I've not done anything differently lately. Lloyds TSB has got any money I have left over. I don't really understand stocks and shares but I'd really like to!</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>No. I tend to be one of those people - I move on very, very fast, and I make it a policy not to regret things I've done or not done.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>People always talk to me about property, and I tend to talk about <a href=\"http://completingchains.com\">completingchains.com</a>, a website I've recently got involved in, which is a very simple but clever tool that matches up people who want to sell one house and buy another - meaning that all those frustrated homeowners can move house without having to drop their prices massively.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>It feels like the whole country is holding their breath and at some point they are going to have to breathe. And with that, things will continue moving. Is it going to get worse? I think if everybody can be a bit more sensible and grown-up, then it should not last too long. It's not as bad as everyone says. People are still buying things in shops. Are the bars empty because everyone is broke? No. We were in a period of unsustainable gluttony, and now is a much more realistic place to be.</p> <h2>Mark Dampier - Head of research at IFA firm Hargreaves Lansdown</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338260808\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/02/07/Mark-Dampier220.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown\" width=\"220\" height=\"180\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>I am now in my early 50s so pension planning has become a big focus for me. In fact, savings generally has, and I use an Isa and Sipp (self-invested personal pension) for this. I am highly geared to the market because, first, I work in financial services, so my salary comes directly from this. And second, I have a large part of my wealth tied up in Hargreaves Lansdown shares, which means I am very geared to the stock market. Therefore within both my Sipp and Isa I have become gradually more defensive. However there are some exceptions to this!</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>Given the state of the stockmarket, I suppose any regret might be that I invested any money at all. Even in corporate bonds there have been disappointments because, despite the fund managers suggesting there was such compelling value in financials, corporate bonds have, with the exception of M&amp;G Optimal - which I have in my portfolio - done poorly. The risk-reward characteristics have been turned on their head, as high yield has done better than investment-grade corporate bonds because they have no exposure to financials. Other than that, I have been placing more money into Neptune Russia as the stockmarket there has continued to fall. Frankly, on about four times earnings, it looks the cheapest market in the world. I have also placed more money in our own HL Income and Growth Portfolio. Despite the performance of UK income funds in 2007 and early 2008, with yields of between 4% and 6% net and my view that interest rates are going to fall extremely sharply, I think this is one sector of the market that is well worth accumulating on the poor days. </p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>The repayment of debt is the major one. I think we will see a very different environment whereby people won't instantly be able to get what they want and will now have to save up for it. I would also suggest that people build up an emergency fund of money. I am amazed at how few people have three to six months salary behind them. Apart from cash, I believe regular savings plans into pensions and Isas should be continued and increased, allowing investors to pick up cheap units and iron out the market moves.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>I do think you need to divorce the stockmarket from the economy. The stockmarket is a discounting mechanism, so will bottom well before the economy. When I look at the FTSE, there is certainly plenty of good value at a level between 4000 and 5000. At around 4800 the FTSE is yielding more than the 10-year gilt and below 4500 will be yielding more than cash. While I know there will be dividend cuts, I do believe good fund managers will avoid the worst of these. The economy, on the other hand, looks dreadful and I see 2009 being a recessionary year. House prices will continue to fall with a total drop in excess of 25% and unemployment will continue to rise. The deleveraging process will be painful and consumer spending will be drastically reduced, but savings rates will at last increase.</p> <h2>Martin Lewis - Financial expert and founder of <a href=\"http://MoneySavingExpert.com\">MoneySavingExpert.com</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338261334\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/06/12/MartinLewis.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lewis, the money saving expert\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Nell Freeman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nell Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>My \"savings safety\" article has been read 800,000 times in the last fortnight. I'm following that strategy - I have my money spread about in a number of top savings accounts, and some in the various nationalised savings institutions.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>No, not really. I tend to practise what I preach. Before I buy anything, I always ask myself: 1) will I use it? 2) is it worth it? 3) can I find it cheaper anywhere else? When it comes to investing, the nature of my job means I don't invest in any individual shares because I don't feel it's appropriate with what I do. However, on the night that HBOS was wobbling and its share price was rock-bottom, the day before the Lloyds announcement, I remember saying to friends, \"I wish I could buy, I'd pile in right now!\"</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>The biggest tip I can give is that more people are impacted by inflation than the credit crunch - the price of food, gas and electricity and petrol are all hitting home very hard. Simply take a day at a weekend to systematically work through your finances. The average person in the UK is throwing away 20% of their salary by spending too much on products.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>At this time, the vote in the US hasn't happened yet. For me, that is a defining moment of our financial generation. If the bail-out happens, I think we will have a recession, with unemployment rising up to the two million level and house prices continuing to drop, and a period of substantial belt-tightening. If they don't vote in favour of the bail-out, then I think we will have a recession that makes the early 80s look like a walk in the park.</p> <h2>Deborah Hargreaves - Business editor, the Guardian</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing? </strong><br>I have recently topped up my savings in the Post Office Instant Saver account which is run by Bank of Ireland and so now benefits from a blanket guarantee for two years.</p> <p><strong>Regrets? </strong><br>At the beginning of this year, I sold half of my shares in Pearson that I had accumulated from previous share savings schemes. I should have sold them all. I invested my pension AVC in a balanced half-shares, half-bond fund when I should have opted for the safer all bonds and cash option.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>I always give people the same advice. The only safe investments are National Savings - I have saved for all of my children's university fees through their products. Of course, Northern Rock is now protected too. I have been arguing with friends about why buy-to-let is not a great option for years.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get? </strong><br>I am worried that it could get a lot worse. Credit will become much more expensive. It is not a time to be thinking of taking on a big mortgage.</p> <h2>Tom McPhail - Head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>Counting it carefully, though this doesn't take quite as long as it used to. My cash is spread across more than one account, and my long-term investments are still predominantly in UK and overseas shares. I'm committing new money to the markets when appropriate - on a long-term view this is still the best strategy.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>Could have followed my instinct and gone overweight in gold, but this is balanced up by the rash bets that I didn't take. So no, I have few regrets.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>Don't stop investing. Investors have an amazing capacity to buy high and sell low - don't make that mistake now.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>The financial fallout into the real economy over the next year is going to be painful; job losses and mortgage payment shocks are going to hurt.

What crystallised the problems that had been below the surface was a fall in house prices in the US, and so house prices need to stabilise for the situation to improve significantly. How quickly that happens will depend to a large extent on government action. The situation in the UK could nevertheless be helped by decisive government action rather than dithering most of the time. For example, I suspect the flow of funds to Irish banks will before long force the government to offer a 100% guarantee on UK bank deposits. However, I think UK house prices will stabilise by the middle of next year on the back of sharply lower interest rates.</p> <h2>Ian Marsh - Professor of finance, Cass Business School</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>Cash holdings diversified across banks and currencies. Keep exposure to any one institution below \u00a335,000. </p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>Yeah, I should have bought a Nikon camera, not a Sony.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>Know exactly how much money you have, where it is, what security you have and who is managing it. Most people I talk to have a vague idea of their savings - the \u00a335,000 guaranteed limit is not that much for some people. Make sure you are taking advantage of the insurance out there. You are paying for it because the government will use taxes if necessary to fund this. Also, be very careful with big payments. Should you by some miracle sell your house, the cash you deposit is not covered.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Potentially way worse. All this has been caused by losses in the subprime US housing market. Had you heard of that market three years ago? Me neither. Just wait until real losses start in prime mortgages or corporate credit markets. Main Street is holding up surprisingly well given the meltdown on Wall Street. But this won't last forever. Wall Street banks have taken capital from sources they would not have considered two years back. It is clear they are in panic. </p> <h2>Toby Young - Author of How To Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>I don't have any money.

  "<p>I am astonished afresh each time I'm reminded that there are people who don't use to-do lists. They get up, do things all day, then go to bed. At no point in this process do they cross off tasks in a notebook, fill in timetables with coloured felt-tip pens or organise complex systems of Post-its. They just do things. The notion of dedicating time to time-management strikes them as perverse, so presumably the idea of weighing the pros and cons of different kinds of to-do lists, as I've been doing recently, would trigger paroxysms of horror. Obviously these people are freaks and should be shunned. This week's column isn't for them.</p> <p>For those of us who do keep a to-do list, whether sporadically or religiously, it's often a cause of mixed feelings. Writing a list provides a sense of control. But if you fail to complete it - or even end the day with a longer list than you started with - the feeling is one of defeat and of losing control. We use lists to help us focus but, then again, we value spontaneity; we don't want to feel governed by the list. We're also dimly aware that making lists can be a form of procrastination: you feel as if you're taking constructive action when you're not. </p> <p>Is there a way to use to-do lists happily, without adding stress or killing spontaneity? There's an absurd amount of writing on the topic, but only a handful of key points:</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Don't use one list for multiple purposes: are you using a single list both as a reminder of everything you're committed to doing, and as a menu of tasks for one specific day? That's a recipe for stress - plus you'll never get the buzz of crossing the last item off a list, which all anal-retentives treasure. So keep two: a \"master list\", which you should never expect to \"finish\", and a daily list, created by selecting tasks from the master list.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Use \"will-do\", not \"to-do\" lists: When making the daily list, don't pick 20 things you hope to do and that you think will add up to one day's work: you'll overestimate your capacities. Instead, pick the three or four most important things, and really commit to doing them, even if you think they'll take you only a couple of hours, suggests Luciano Passuello at litemind.com. Keeping promises to yourself like this is exhilarating; if you find you have time to spare, pick more items from the master list.</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>The daily list should be a \"closed list\": new work floods in constantly, but don't add it to the current day's list unless it's an emergency: keep that list \"closed\" and add the incoming items to the master list. (Mark Forster takes this principle much further in his absorbing book Do It Tomorrow, but that's the gist.) Oh, and you know how you sometimes add a task to a list even though you've already completed it, just for the thrill of crossing it out? (Admit it: you do.) That's allowed. We tragic list-makers must take our pleasures where we can.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Ryanair is facing its first group legal action from passengers battling to force the low-cost airline to stand by EU compensation rules. The action is being led by Dutch company EUclaim, and initially involves at least 36 complaints. </p> <p>Critics accuse the Dublin-based no-frills carrier of abandoning passengers to fend for themselves when it cancels flights, and subsequently ignoring their claims for compensation. </p> <p>However, this week a number of passengers began a fightback through EUclaim. The company said it has passed at least 36 claims to Dublin-based law firm Lavelle Coleman with a view to bringing a legal action. All have had claims against the airline denied or ignored. Ryanair says the claims are \"greedy ambulance chasing\".</p> <p>Since 2005 passengers who have suffered long delays after cancellations, or those denied boarding, have been entitled under EU rules to compensation of between \u20ac250 (\u00a3200) and \u20ac600, depending on the length of the flight. </p> <p>Since the European Commission introduced the rules, airlines have tried to minimise payouts. For example, if a cancellation is caused by \"extraordinary circumstances\" or for \"safety reasons\", the airline is not required to compensate. But critics say they use this as a get-out when they are liable. </p> <p>EUclaim has received a \"rapidly growing\" number of claims from Ryanair passengers who have suffered delays or cancellations, including some left several hundred miles from their destination without further assistance. </p> <p>In recent years, Guardian Money has featured numerous cases of air passengers forced to go to the small claims court to recover their losses in such instances. Many have been successful.</p> <p>EUclaim chief executive Hendrik Noorderhaven says: \"Sadly, the EU rules have not been effective in the UK and Ireland, where it appears the law and its requirement that passengers receive compensation is being blatantly ignored by this low-cost carrier. We have submitted dozens of claims to Ryanair, and there are more in the pipeline, but as yet we have not had a proper response from them. That is why we made the decision to take legal action. Ryanair is not above the law - it had an agreement with these consumers and failed to meet its obligations.\"</p> <p>His company, featured in Money this year, has built a giant database which tracks every commercial airliner as it flies round the globe. It combines airport departure information with the departure and expected arrival time data provided between the airlines to build a picture of where each plane is at any time. The result, he says, enables the company to check whether the excuse passengers are given for not being offered compensation is correct.</p> <p>\"Most flights are withdrawn in the summer when the weather is fine. In most cases it is because the airline hasn't got enough planes, so they cancel the flight that will cause them the fewest headaches. They tell passengers it's due to extraordinary circumstances, but really they are making a business decision.\"</p> <p>He says EUclaim has won compensation for some 5,000 people, collecting an average of \u00a3865 per filed claim. His company takes 27% of the money on a no-win no-fee basis.</p> <p>The Air Transport Users Council admits carriers have been reluctant to pay out even when passengers are entitled to compensation. Airlines have cited crew shortages as a reason for cancelling flights and tried to claim it was for technical reasons, when in fact they failed to roster staff properly, it said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Lavelle Coleman says the legal firm wrote to Ryanair several weeks ago asking it to respond to the passengers' claims. \"If we don't get a satisfactory response, the next step will be to begin proceedings in the courts to recover what is rightfully owed to these passengers, \" she says.</p> <p>On behalf of chief executive Michael O'Leary, a spokesman said: \"We will never deal with greedy, ambulance-chasing organisations who promote a compensation culture where people claim for anything and everything.</p> <p>\"Ryanair will carry over 58 million passengers this year, have the best on-time performance of any European airline at 88%, lose just 0.5 bags per 1,000 passenger and cancel fewer flights than any other major European airline.</p> <p>\"From time to time a small number of passengers may feel disgruntled. They should contact Ryanair customer services in writing as set out on our website and can expect to have a reply within seven working days.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Passengers whose compensation claims are wrongly denied can sue through the small claims court, or use a company such as <a href=\"http://EUclaim.co.uk\">EUclaim.co.uk</a>.<br><a href=\"http://m.brignall@theguardian.com\"><br>m.brignall@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>The title tells it like it is. Sherman Alexie was born a Spokane Indian. He grew up where the book is set, on a reservation - the \"rez\" - in Wellpinit, Washington state. He was, like his central character, hydrocephalic at birth, \"with too much grease inside my skull\". And in his teens he attended Reardan High School, off the reservation, near the rich farm town, where all the other students were white. Many authors hum and ha when asked if their fiction is in any way autobiographical. This one makes no bones about it and yet skilfully manages to transform his actual experience into a novel. True fiction. Absolutely.</p> <p>Arnold Spirit Jnr, known simply as Junior on the rez, speaks directly to the reader and is both narrator and illustrator, a cartoonist. He feels like rubbish, gets beaten up as a matter of course because he lisps, stutters and looks like a freak, but with a pen in his hand he finds a sense of being \"important\". He can at least express what it's like living his life. For example, he describes on one page how it \"sucks to be poor\", and on the next sketches portraits of his parents as they might have been if someone had paid attention to their dreams. His could-have-been mother is smart in her suit, a community college teacher. His another-life father is hip, a professional saxophonist. He doesn't draw what they actually are. He just uses a couple of words for that. She is an ex-drunk. He is a drunk. In fact Junior only knows five Indians who have never drunk alcohol, one of them being his bandana-wearing grandmother: \"Drinking would shut down my seeing and my hearing and my feeling.\" </p> <p>Junior might have brain damage from surgery and seizures but he is following in grandmother's footsteps, engaged with the world, full of anger and energy. Too full. When he sees his mother's name in a geometry textbook in class, he just cannot bear that his generation are still studying from the same books as the last. There is a graphic illustration of boy throwing a book at his white teacher and breaking his nose. Suspension follows. But then the wounded teacher comes to visit. He isn't happy about Junior's assault but he's also brimful of guilt, as his job has been to educate their culture out of his Indian students. And he has some advice for Junior: \"You have to take your hope and go somewhere where other people have hope.\" And the most hope belongs to white people. So Junior makes the bold decision to leave his home turf and go to Reardan. No matter that he has to walk more than 20 miles to get there each day because there isn't enough money for gas. </p> <p>He finds friendship with a geek, Rowdy, who teaches him the art of reading. He gets to be the semi-boyfriend of the beautiful, milky Penelope, who wears her bulimia like a badge of honour. Even the jocks learn to respect him, especially when he emerges as a whizz on the basketball court. The only problem is that the league schedule inevitably includes on-court battles against the team from his old school, whose star player used to be his best friend, who sees him as a traitor. And so he must be warrior enough to face his people and defeat them. In his own words, this is \"really weird\". </p> <p>Some books are like living organisms. They seem to breathe, laugh, weep, joke, confront, meet you eye to eye. Maybe it's the combination of drawings, pithy turns of phrase, candour, tragedy, despair and hope that makes this more than an entertaining read, more than an engaging story about a North American Indian kid who makes it out of a poor, dead-end background without losing his connection with who he is and where he's from. The writing occasionally relies too heavily on the cartoonesque quip, but mostly it is muscular and snappy with a knack for capturing the detail and overview with wrenching spareness. One chapter is a gem of love and heartbreak. \"And a Partridge in a Pear Tree\" covers barely two pages and yet it evokes so much as it describes Junior's dad's return from a drunken binge over the holiday period, then the offer to his son of a five-dollar bill scrunched in his boot: \"Man that thing smelled like booze and fear and failure.\" Opening this book is like meeting a friend you'd never make in your actual life and being given a piece of his world, inner and outer. It's humane, authentic and, most of all, it speaks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Diane Samuels's plays include Kindertransport and The True-Life Fiction of Mata Hari</p>",
  "<p>Alaa Al Aswany, the Egyptian novelist, became famous overnight in the Arab world with the publication of his first novel, The Yacoubian Building, in 2002. That compulsively readable book, which became a massive bestseller in Arabic, focused on a once grand but now decaying building in central Cairo; it was set during the 1990 Gulf war and offered a microcosm of Egyptian society. Al Aswany wrote in a fearless manner, especially when it came to sexual and political matters. In the mix of characters living in the building one found, for instance, an extravagant playboy, a gay intellectual, and a devout Islamic fundamentalist. The author drew each portrait with a bravado that was something new under the Middle Eastern sun.</p> <p>Chicago, his eagerly awaited second novel, is not as interesting or fully realised as the first, but has undeniable charms of its own. Al Aswany has a Dickensian sense of character, and one will not easily forget the ghastly Ahmad Danana, who runs the Egyptian Students' Union in Chicago, where the book is set. Like many of the diverse group of Egyptian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the novel, he is studying medicine (Al Aswany was himself trained in dentistry in Chicago); but Danana hopes to become a prominent figure when he returns to Egypt, and so he works as a government spy. As his new wife soon discovers, he has miserly and selfish tendencies. And it's even worse than that: \"To put it bluntly, she hated the way her husband had intercourse with her.\" There is no seduction, no care for her feelings. </p> <p>Danana stands in contrast to an appealing mathematician, Nagi Abd al-Samad, who reveals himself wonderfully in his journal, as when he writes: \"The soldier fights his enemies ferociously, wishing to annihilate them all. But if he were destined, just once, to cross to the other side and to walk among them, he would see one of them writing letters to his wife, another looking at his children's photos, and a third shaving and humming a tune.\" This idealistic young man has his heart set on transforming Egypt into a western-style democracy, and thus he becomes a threat to the current government back home, which keeps a sharp eye on its citizens abroad. </p> <p>Among Al Aswany's other memorable characters is Shaymaa Muhammadi, who is \"over thirty, still unmarried because her position as instructor in the College of Medicine has greatly reduced her chances, since Eastern men usually prefer that their wives be less educated than they\". Her story is told with special poignancy. There is also Dr Muhammad Salah, who has adapted fairly well to life in the United States, although he pines for a lost love in Egypt; indeed, he yearns for Egypt itself. </p> <p>The cast of characters is a large one, and Chicago weaves together their various stories - too many of them, perhaps. An impending visit by the president of Egypt produces all sorts of plot possibilities, setting off a good deal of subterfuge. The spectre of an embarrassing political protest, for example, excites the \"arrogant and suspicious\" Safwat Shakir, a sleazy government agent with a military background and one of the least likeable actors in Al Aswany's motley troupe. </p> <p>To these Egyptians abroad the novelist adds a small group of Americans, mostly professors in the department of histology. But the American characters are scarcely believable, being thinly drawn caricatures who speak in a wooden manner, representing competing points of view and nothing more. </p> <p>This is a shrewdly conceived novel: by isolating his Egyptians in an alien culture, Al Aswany finds the pressure points in their personalities, as each undergoes cultural traumas of one kind or another. There are profound, often chilling, moments of self-realisation along the way, as when the unhappy Dr Salah descends one morning into the basement of his house and uncovers an old suitcase that contains the clothes he had brought to America from Egypt 30 years before: \"He thought at the time they were elegant but discovered immediately that they were not suitable for America; wearing them he looked as if he had come from another planet or as if he were a character that had stepped out of a period play.\" Now he empties the suitcase, and strips to his underwear in the damp basement, a creature hovering between two worlds, between past and present. \"It occurred to him that he had actually gone crazy,\" writes Al Aswany, in this moving scene.</p> <p>Alaa Al Aswany is among the best writers in the Middle East today, a suitable heir to the mantle worn by Naguib Mahfouz, his great predecessor, whose influence is felt on every page. Yet Al Aswany has his own magic. His remarkable gift for narrative momentum sustains Chicago. It may not reach the heights of The Yacoubian Building, but it reveals a gifted novelist in mid-flight.</p> <p>\u2022 Jay Parini's most recent book is The Last Station (Canongate)</p>",
  "<p>While most people know that Barbara Vine is the pseudonym of Ruth Rendell, the much-garlanded \"queen of crime\" and Labour peer, many do not understand how Rendell's Vine novels differ from those written under her own name. They are often characterised as darker, more psychologically complex and so on, but it is easier to think of them as murder mysteries in reverse: everything seems clear at the start, but mysteries emerge and tensions rise until the revelation of a violent or shocking act, often committed far in the past and hidden from the light. There is no detective, and often no real perpetrator; Vine is so good at sweeping us into the minds of ordinary people that she can make us react with horror to acts that, out of context, might not seem all that bad.</p> <p>The Birthday Present is full of context - perhaps too full. It follows Ivor Tesham, a breezy but ambitious young Tory politician in the last days of Margaret Thatcher's government. As he confesses to his brother-in-law, Rob, one of the book's two narrators, he is having an affair with a married woman, Hebe. You can glean all you need to know about Ivor's character from the fact that he proudly tells Rob he is thinking of asking Hebe to leave her husband and two-year-old son - not to move in with him, of course, but to set her up in a flat in Mayfair. Rob, who is devoted to his own family, says that Hebe would at least want to bring her toddler along. \"That would be a bit of a drawback,\" says Ivor.</p> <p>So when Ivor conceives a plan to pay two minicab drivers \u00a3500 to stage a birthday \"adventure\" for Hebe, involving handcuffs, a blindfold and a mock kidnapping, you can't help but feel it is bound to go wrong. As Vine points out several times, this was the era of Tory sleaze and political arrogance, when a Labour victory seemed a laughable prospect. </p> <p>Indeed, the time and place are so much stressed that the story seems secondary. It is not giving too much away to reveal that the car used in the kidnap collides with a lorry, leaving Hebe and one man dead and the driver comatose in hospital. A gun is found in the wreckage - a real one. Ivor, of course, is terrified that his role may leak to the press. The question of what steps he will take to stop this happening - notably in the case of the injured survivor, who may wake up at any moment - drives his half of the book. How far, in private, is this respected public figure prepared to go? </p> <p>There is another major player in the drama: Jane, the friend Hebe used to say she was meeting when she was seeing Ivor. Jane's diary makes up the other half of the book, and it is by far the more interesting. She exemplifies that type which Vine, and her counterpart, PD James, do so well: the solitary adult, lonely for too long - bitter, emotionally stunted, swinging between self-deception and self-pity. Jane is spiteful and callous yet pathetic, and we feel for her. There is a marvellously evocative description of her bedsit, with its \"minute fridge, baby oven and mini electric kettle\". Her involvement as the \"alibi lady\" adds a further touch of suspense, since she is unbalanced from the start and seems to be getting worse.</p> <p>The sad truth, however, is that all these promising sparks do not result in fireworks. There are plenty of dark hints and false leads, but the twist in the tale leaves most of the loose ends hanging. What's more, the suspense worked up so potently in earlier Vine novels is not in evidence. </p> <p>Perhaps that is because her favourite theme, obsession, never comes into play. Ivor is ruthless but pragmatic and there is not much that is ominous about that, even in a politician. Or is there? Rendell spends a lot of time in the House of Lords - perhaps she knows something we don't.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Madeley straddles his chair, Christine Keeler-like, looks me in the eye and embarks on a family history that could be lifted straight from a Thomas Hardy novel. We begin in the early 20th century with his great-grandfather, Henry Madeley.</p> <p>The impoverished Henry was desperate to emigrate from England to Canada with his wife and seven children, and make a new start, but they did not have the money. In 1907, Henry approached his brother William, a farmer, for financial help. William, who was unmarried, told him he would give him the money on one condition - Henry should give him his 10-year-old son, Geoffrey, to work on the farm in Shawbury, just outside Shrewsbury. When Geoffrey woke up one morning, his parents and six brothers and sisters were nowhere to be seen. They had left for Canada without a word. And thus, says Richard Madeley, journalist, television presenter and most famously the adolescent half of Richard and Judy, were the men of his family shaped for generations to come.</p> <p>In 1917, Geoffrey enlisted and was sent to the trenches. On the way to the south coast, his train pulled up at Crewe alongside a train full of Canadian soldiers. He wondered whether his brothers, whom he'd not seen for a decade, could be on the train, scoffed at the idea, but went to look anyway. Of course, he found them. When the war was over, he went to join the rest of his family in Canada. He planned to spend the rest of his days in his adopted country, but then he received a letter from his uncle telling him he must return - if he did, he would inherit the farm. Geoffrey did not particularly want the farm, but he felt the pull of duty. He returned and ran the farm. When his uncle died, he left him nothing, bequeathing the farm to Geoffrey's brothers and sisters in Canada. </p> <p>Richard Madeley's surprising book, Fathers &amp; Sons, traces his family tree through the male line - the silent betrayal of his great-grandfather Henry, the quietly repressed Geoffrey, his own loving but violent father, and finally Richard the journalist and television presenter who could talk for England and for whom nothing is a no-go area. As much as anything, the book is a reflection of how times have changed, from a Britain that bordered on the feudal, to the buttoned-up 50s, to the emotional incontinence of today.</p> <p>We meet at Cactus TV, the studios where Richard &amp; Judy is recorded. Madeley is 52 now, and looks like a 40-year-old trying to pass as a 30-year-old - skinny jeans, green T-shirt, shades and thick brown hair with just a leaf of silver at the back. He has often been compared to the fictional TV presenter Alan Partridge - a gaffe-prone, cringe-inducing egomaniac who drowns out his guests in a torrent of bad puns and me-me-me interruptions. And there is something of that in him. But he's also a compelling presenter, skilled and intimate and engaging. Partridge is a perennial loser; Madeley, alongside his wife Judy Finnigan, reinvented daytime television and then the late-afternoon slot. With their phenomenal book club, they became two of the most powerful players in British publishing. </p> <p>Their USP has always been that they are the genuine article. When they break down in hysterics or when Judy shoots him an I'll-kill-you-when-we-get-home scowl, we assume there is no element of calculation, that there is no gap between the private and public Richard and Judy. TV couples have been created (Anne Diamond and Nick Owen, Fern Britton and Philip Schofield), but they have lacked the crucial R&amp;J ingredient - they are not real. </p> <p>Seven years after moving to Channel 4, Richard and Judy are heading off to a new digital television station as a team again, but at the same time Madeley is striking out by himself, notably with this book. He's noticed, he says, they have a history of working in seven-year cycles. Isn't there something biblical about the number seven, I say. \"There is. And seven years is supposed to be one of the luckiest numbers in China. After eight.\" It's a classic Madeleyism - a little bit know-all and a little bit wrong (seven is often regarded as an unlucky number by the Chinese).</p> <p>He explains why he wrote the book. Again, it's classic Madeley. There is no pretence of being tortured by his family history, or a need to unburden himself. He was simply talking families with his agent, mentioned his grandad, and the agent stopped him there and said, \"There's your book.\" Madeley has always had an eye for the angle. At the same time, there's something engagingly ingenuous about him. The only difference between real-life Madeley and telly Madeley is the swearing.</p> <p>It was when he was writing the book that he realised quite how shocking his story was. And the more he wrote, the more a theme emerged. \"It's about how rejection can breed rejection.\" Does he think his great-grandfather Henry's rejection of his son was a conscious act of cruelty? \"No, I think that was a purely commercial issue for him. He was broke, needed help, and that was the only help that was on offer. That, to me, is where the damage begins.\"</p> <p>The real cruelty, he says, is in the manner Geoffrey was betrayed by his uncle William. If he didn't want to leave the farm to Geoffrey, Madeley asks, why didn't he leave it to, say, the local cattery, or to his sister, instead of to Geoffrey's siblings whom he barely knew? \"I don't think William could bear to give up the control he'd established over this human being. He'd lured him back to the farm with this false promise, and then he reneged on it. For William, as he was lying on his deathbed, the next best thing to hanging on to control of Geoffrey was to hand it on to somebody else rather than give him back control of his life.\" Blimey, it is twisted, I say. </p> <p>\"The whole story is twisted,\" Madeley says. \"Could you imagine saying to your brother, 'Yes, I'll advance you the money, but I want one of your kids. And not because I'm childless or can give them a better life than you, but because I want them to work on my farm for nothing, effectively.' Jesus, it's an extraordinary mindset.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Geoffrey Madeley grew up troubled. He was almost pathologically introverted. He did not know how to take pleasure from life. He beat his son Christopher. One day, without warning, Geoffrey sent him away from home to a remote boarding school, a gothic horror of a building, 50 miles away. Christopher was lonely, unhappy and bewildered. He felt he must have wronged his father in some terrible way but didn't know how. Madeley is convinced it was simply the sins of the fathers being visited on the son; another perverse form of vengeance. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Christopher also grew up troubled: bright, handsome, but emotionally inhibited to the point of petrification. He went to work in Canada as a journalist, returned to Britain a married man, and had two children. And yet there was still the brooding silence, the anger. </p> <p>Whereas Madeley had to rely on his mother's memories for much of the family history, now his recollections become first-hand and painful. His father's rage was expressed savagely, all too often in his beating young Richard, usually on a Saturday when his wife was away working.</p> <p>There was a horrible symmetry to it all. Years earlier, Geoffrey had beaten Christopher for crumbling a chocolate biscuit into soil in the garden in the belief that he could grow a chocolate biscuit tree. When Richard was 10, he was beaten for the last and most vicious time, after chomping his way through a pack of Rolos. Perhaps it was a postwar thing - the Madeley family could not tolerate waste or extravagance. His father asked him to remove his shirt and then hit him repeatedly, dementedly, with a stick. In the end, Richard started fighting back, pinching and grabbing at his father. The cuts and bruises he suffered kept him off school. It's funny, he says, how when you start writing it all down, so much more returns. \"It freezes the frame, and you start to remember all sorts of detail that I hadn't remembered since the day it happened. For example, I was made to face that picture on the wall of the lake in Canada painted by my grandmother with grey rocks in water, and I was wondering whether that would be the punishment - counting them. And next thing, whack, I'm being hit. That last beating, I'd remembered I'd been very badly beaten and chased round the room, but I'd forgotten I'd had to take my shirt off and I'd forgotten I'd fought with him. I'd forgotten I'd thrown the stick at him, all sorts of things. And that's emblematic of the book, really. Writing about the past, you see it in hologram form. Writing about it is really to stick your fingers into the memory.\"</p> <p>He thinks he was beaten maybe 25 times over the space of a year or two. \"The beatings varied in how long they went on for, but they never varied in the strength with which he delivered these blows, which was fucking hard. But it was quite a thin stick, so it wasn't going to break anything except the skin.\"</p> <p>None of his classmates experienced anything as bad. \"Dad just lost it. He'd boil over, go out, get his fucking stick, come back in and hit me till he stopped feeling angry. I'm no psychiatrist, but I think he was expelling this poison that had seeped into his life. I was in the way and I got hit.\"</p> <p>His mother heard the final beating from downstairs. She was terrified and appalled, threatened to call the police, and told Christopher if he did that again she would leave him. Madeley's sister was never beaten by his father. He says it was a strictly father-son thing. For all that, he never stopped loving his father. He insists the beatings were an aberration; that he was a caring man, a good man, an inspiration. A few days after the Rolo incident, his father did something that was to change their relationship for good. He apologised, and promised he would never hit him again. \"He told me how ashamed he was. And to make that promise and see me accept it at face value was his way out of that dark valley he'd stumbled into.\" Christopher Madeley never did hit his son again. </p> <p>At 16, Richard Madeley left school and followed his father into journalism. He'd been expected to go on to A-levels and then university, but he had itchy feet and wanted out. He worked on a local newspaper, and by the age of 19 he had risen to assistant editor and joined the BBC. But he felt like a little boy, exposed and inadequate. He was self-conscious about his limited education, unworldly and had nothing to contribute to the conversation. So he bluffed his way through life. \"Early on I developed this carapace of confidence, because it was the only way for me to survive. And it sort of lingered. But I was terrified. Totally different breed of people. I'd sit with them at lunch time with a pint in the Hilltop Heights hotel and I felt so diminished. I used to make an excuse and go and sit on the loo. I just couldn't hold my own. So, yes, it was very much a carapace, and to some extent it still is.\" He stops and thinks about it. Well, actually, he says, after so many years, perhaps it becomes the real thing.</p> <p>He moved on to ITV and Granada Reports, where he worked with the brilliant maverick presenter and impresario Tony Wilson and Judy Finnigan. Madeley was there as the straight man, to curb Wilson's excesses. Wilson, he says, taught him one of life's most important lessons. \"There was graffiti all over Manchester saying, 'Tony Wilson is a wanker' and I'd been at Granada Reports for about a week, and someone was joking with him about it, and I said, 'Don't you mind?' and he said, 'What should I mind for? It's fuckin' funny. I am a fuckin' wanker and you're a fuckin' wanker. We're on the fuckin' telly. If you're on the telly, you're a wanker.' \" </p> <p>Did he understand what Wilson meant? \"Totally. Totally got it. What I understood was it was absolutely crucial as a human being, let alone a human being who'd gone into telly, not to take yourself remotely seriously. Because so many people take the industry and themselves terribly seriously, and it's horrible to behold.\"</p> <p>It could be said that since Wilson put him straight, Madeley has made a career out of being a wanker. He says things the rest of us would like to but are too polite to do so. You can be incredibly rude to guests, I say. For instance, there was the time Nick Mason from Pink Floyd was on the show and you repeatedly told him he looked like an accountant, and Judy was giving you the stare. \"Some of that is theatre, you know. I'm not saying it's pretend television - it's not - but there is an element of the theatrical in some of her reprimands to me, or mine to her. I can't imagine that Judy would give a flying fuck that I described Nick Mason as an accountant. But she might, like you, pick up on the innate rudeness of the comment.\" </p> <p>At times, his lack of inhibition teeters on exhibitionism. Think of the Madeley who does ridiculous Ali G impressions, chases flies around the studio, and tells the nation about his daughter's periods and his and Judy's experiment with Viagra. </p> <p>We're more than an hour into the interview, and he's still straddling his chair energetically. Is it true he likes to go commando, I ask. \"Always,\" he says incisively. \"Always.\" Is it a family tradition? \"No, I think it might have started when Jack [his son] nicked my socks and underwear. And I think one day I thought, fuck it, and couldn't be arsed to have a row looking for them, and I found it quite comfortable.\" </p> <p>Does Judy go commando? \"No. Certainly not. She wears knickers. No, I just find it comfortable. It's like not smoking for some people.\" Another classic Madeleyism. He is famous for them: gaffes, statements that don't quite make sense or are inappropriate. For the first time he is slightly defensive. People talk about Madeleyisms, he says, but it's mostly bollocks, they're apocryphal. Such as? \" 'So tell me about the autobiography, what it's about.' I have got this comet's tail of gaffes behind me, most of which are not true. But, hey, I'm still here! I supremely don't care.\"</p> <p>When Richard and Judy moved to 5pm, the doom-mongers said it couldn't work. And for a time it looked as if it wouldn't. What would have happened to them if it had failed? \"Well, fuck, it's not brain surgery, we would have ended up doing something else. But that terrible expression 'the brand' would have undoubtedly taken a dent.\"</p> <p>Would that have been a worry? \"Well, I don't really think of us as a brand, but I know people do talk about the Richard and Judy brand and the book club and all that. That's how it's perceived in a cold, professional way. But it's not as if we're getting divorced. We could still live together.\" </p> <p>What is more important, the brand or the marriage? \"Oh, the marriage.\"</p> <p>Do they merge? \"Well, obviously they do merge. We worked together before we were married, so television presenting has always been interwoven into the fabric of our relationship. But we didn't work together for the first two years of our marriage. People like yourself on the outside say, 'Ooh, if they stopped working together, would that spell the end of the whole relationship?' Honestly, absolutely not.\"</p> <p>Perhaps, I suggest, there could be a time when they don't want to work together in order to refresh their relationship. He looks at me as if I'm bonkers. \"I don't feel, and nor does Judy, the need to refresh our life. Honestly, it's fine. Everybody looks for the serpent in paradise, the looming crisis. You're married yourself, are you? Well, you know what it's like... You knock the corners off each other and you learn by looking around you... To have a good, lasting relationship, it's a matter of luck. I know there's work involved, but fundamentally it's about having the good fortune to come across the right person at the right time. So, no, it's never crossed our mind whether we'd still be happy together if we didn't work together.\"</p> <p>He concedes that it's not surprising people like to talk about their marriage - in a way, they have encouraged it. If they are in a bad mood with each other, they do not attempt to hide it. After the programme, Madeley says, one of the most common conversations on the web forums is whether they rowed last night and what about. Meanwhile, Richard and Judy themselves have often drawn attention to their age difference, and given it their own little Freudian frisson. The first time they met at Granada Reports, Judy introduced herself to him with, \"Hello, I'm your mummy.\" Ah, yes, Madeley says, but context is all. \"It wasn't, 'I'm seven years and eight months older than you, therefore you can call me Mummy.' Granada Television had a parenting policy, when somebody new came into the newsroom. That parent could be younger than them - it was always the opposite sex - showing them where the toilets were, where the canteen was, etc. It was a light-hearted way of welcoming you aboard.\"</p> <p>How would he react if producers told him he needed a younger, more glamorous partner? \"I'd say you're talking to the wrong guy. But they wouldn't say that. I think the viewers would be really fucked off if that were to happen. It's not going to happen. And if I were to cede to that, which I wouldn't, I'd never work again. It's unthinkable.\" He pauses. \"Of course, we can't go on for ever, I'll be 53 next birthday, Judy's just turned 60...\"</p> <p>When I tell friends that I am going to see Madeley, most want to know one of two things: whether the marriage is for real - he's answered that - and whether Judy has got a drink problem.</p> <p>That, he says, was a rumour, and he knows exactly when it was started, why and by whom. \"We'd gone away for a week to Cornwall with our children, and the mobile went in the car. It was our bosses at Granada saying a terrible rumour was being put around that you're in a self-help institution for men who batter their wives because you've beaten Judy, that Judy's in a drying-out clinic and that the children are in care. We were in the fucking car. We tracked it to the source... A particularly poisonous person. He'd leaked these smears and they were never published because we would have cleaned up in a libel case. But the one thing that lingered like a piece of floating sewage is this thing that Judy drinks. And she doesn't.\"</p> <p>Who drinks more, him or her? \"Oh, me. I think this is to do with misogyny. Somehow it's a better story, a nastier thing to say, that a woman drinks. It's more scandalous. It's completely untrue. Judy's pretty much given up even reacting to it now.\"</p> <p>I say I'll set the record straight: he's the drinker. He smiles. \"I am. I'm the only person on the team who has wine with their lunch. Quite often after the show, Judy will have tonic water and I'll have a drink. I always have drunk more than her... I just invite you to look at her fucking work record.\"</p> <p>What does he think his so buttoned-up father would have made of his career? \"Dad was becoming quite modern as the years went by. He was 49 when he died. I like to think by the time he was in his 60s, he'd have been a very chilled-out guy. I think he would have been quite proud of me, proud of my marriage, my family and what I've achieved.\" And the show? \"I think he would have been amused by this nonsense.\"</p> <p>A few years ago, Richard and Judy wrote their autobiography, and even though his father had been dead for a quarter of a century, Madeley still felt the subject of the beatings was too raw. How does he think Christopher would have reacted to the book? \"If he was alive, the book would have a very different feel to it. I would have gone to him and said, 'Can we talk about that period?' - it was only two years. 'You were a great dad to me' - and he was. I loved him dearly, even in that period. 'It was such an aberration, Dad, what d'you think?' I think he would have probably said, 'Richard, if you don't mind, I'm very ashamed of what happened, as you know, and I made that pledge to you, please don't put it in the book' - and therefore I wouldn't have done it.\"</p> <p>The main difference, he says, between the two of them is confidence. His father so lacked it, whereas he reckons he has too much - even if it did start out as a front. In 1994, Madeley was charged with shoplifting champagne from Tesco, and he says this was a typical example of his overconfidence. The family were going away that day, they had 1,001 things to do, and he was convinced he could squeeze the shopping in, too. In short, he paid for the food in the trolley, forgot to pay for the champagne. \"I was just not concentrating. I put the food through the till, I forgot to take the champagne out. It was, I can handle anything, I can juggle eight balls in the air, and actually I came a horrible cropper. I can joke about it now.\" He was eventually cleared in the crown court. \"But that year was horrible. The publicity was mortifying. If I'd been accused of robbing a bank, at least it's got a bit of glamour to it, but fucking shoplifting... It's like wanking in a public toilet. Just horrible.\"</p> <p>Fathers &amp; Sons ends with Madeley himself as a dad. When he and Judy got together, both had been married and she already had twin boys. They then had a boy and girl together. Did he worry that history would repeat itself, that he would end up rejecting or beating his sons, as had happened repeatedly in his family? No, Madeley says, he was so different from the previous generation - he had none of that poison to get rid of.</p> <p>All the children are now grown up, with three of the four working in the media. Judy had worried that they would suffer empty-nest syndrome, but the children have ended up moving back home in one form or another. Madeley loves the fact that the house pulses with young people, and that they can all sit down together, talk, cook for each other and chat.</p> <p>The epilogue to Fathers &amp; Sons is written by Madeley's son, Jack. He talks about how close he and Madeley are, how alike they are and how both have a quick temper. Well, it's more a petulance and irritability, Madeley says. One of his favourite hobbies is fishing, and he looked forward to the day he would be able to take his kids with him, and they would spend languorous days together by the river. It wasn't to be. \"First time, I thought, great - Jack was about 13 - it was real 'My boy' stuff. We start casting, and of course we're fucking useless. He is casting into shallow water and keeps losing his tackle. And I'm saying, 'Jack, come on, you're losing it' and he's like, 'Well, you're losing it as well, fuck off' and we're shouting at each other and in the end we stamp off home after half an hour. We tried on a few more occasions, with the same results - within 30 minutes we were spitting nails at each other, getting our lines tangled up, just ridiculous. We laugh about it now. But we were incredibly irritated.\"</p> <p>Jack seems to have few complaints about his father. There have been no beatings, and there certainly hasn't been a lack of communication. If his children have any criticism, it's that their father is too unbuttoned.</p> <p>It's strange that all those repressed men - great-grandfather, grandfather, father - who retreated so totally into themselves produced a compulsive communicator. He laughs. \"Yes, maybe that's another consequence. On some fundamental level, I could be compensating for all that silence with all this talking.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Fathers &amp; Sons is published on Monday by Simon &amp; Schuster at \u00a318.99.

  "<p>Sheila Hancock's The Two of Us, about her life with the actor John Thaw and her convulsive grief at his death, sold more than 700,000 copies in hardback and won her the 2005 Author of the Year award. Now comes Just Me, which deals with the years since Thaw's death and her various strategies for moving on. </p> <p>Once again it has the passionate appeal of their love story and is infused with humanity, self-perception and honesty. The thousands of people - many of them widows - who wrote to her following the earlier book will again find solace and comfort in what she has to tell them. But so will many others - those who warm to her gift for directly communicating the open-heartedness and spirit of adventure with which she confronts her life. </p> <p>This time there is less of Thaw, though \"Mr Um Er\", as he was known because of his dithering, remains the touchstone for her sorrow and is always in the background, with his \"bah humbug\" attitude to Christmas. He is the man, she writes, who \"thought she was beautiful and never stopped saying so\". But he is gone and she must move on. She does so through travel, both as a tourist to a multitude of destinations and into her own character and past. She is also determined to make something positive of life as a woman of 75 living alone.</p> <p>Since she had few holidays as a child, and few as an actor, many places are new and fresh to her eyes. And she is no passive traveller. She joins a Solo tour group to Budapest and gets into a fine old row with the guide - \"a plump, rather dour little woman\" - who insists that a certain bridge across the Danube is a copy of Barnes Bridge, when Hancock knows it is Hammersmith. She is arrested in Bangkok because her two names, Thaw and Hancock, strike the authorities as suspicious. She rides an elephant, and kicks off her shoes to nuzzle its skin - \"he acknowledges this with a backward swing of his trunk\". She visits Venice and tackles the art, favouring the paintings of Carpaccio and falling for his little white dog, then heads to Milan in pursuit of Bellini. When snooty guides put her down she bounces back: \"Stuff that. I am a novice and enjoy the pictures on my own terms.\" And we are cheering her on.</p> <p>Most movingly, and in the book's finest descriptive passage, she writes of tracing her roots to Germany, a country for which she retains a visceral hatred born of a wartime childhood. Taking part in BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are? has revealed an ancestral family of Germans, the Zurhorsts, and she goes in search. In the strange silent farmlands of Westphalia she trudges through ploughed fields and arrives at \"a place that seemed to be a restaurant\", where a surly waiter serves bad food and shows her a letter that concludes \"Heil Hitler\". Finally, as she crosses an area where workmen are demolishing a building, one of them makes a deliberate run at her with his digger. She stands her ground. \"It dawned on me that in rural Germany I am still the enemy.\" This calls for a total rethink of her own attitudes, and by the end her blind hatred has been swept away.</p> <p>She is a woman of easy and impulsive reactions, given to immediate impressions and thankful to see good in other people. She speaks of her Quaker background and its injunction to \"live adventurously\". But there is something else that makes her story so appealing to so many. And she herself spots it. \"An actor like me is inclined to overdo the empathy because it is part of our job to put ourselves in other people's shoes.\" It's an empathy that extends to all sorts and conditions of people. </p> <p>She does it for me when she talks of life as an older woman. At an Italian spa for the beautiful people, she slinks to a lounger away from the pool and lies down \"very quickly, because when you lie flat the slack of your skin drops back and you look smoother than when you're standing up\". Not that anyone notices. As she says: \"It is a proven fact that after 50 women do dissolve.\" Later, another spa and a more resigned attitude: \"I neither expect nor hope to be noticed.\" Women need to be noticed in restaurants, though, and there is a caustic account of trying to catch the eye of gossiping waiters in one of London's most famous fish restaurants. \"Hello, I'm here. I thought I was invisible.\" </p> <p>Sheila Hancock is not invisible at all: she is still acting - last year she won an Olivier award for her role as Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider in Cabaret - she mentors a child through the charity Kids Company, and is chancellor of Portsmouth University. She is also strangely self-deprecating - \"most of my achievements are mediocre\" - and given to Shakespearean musings: \"What a piece of work is man\"; \"Lord, what fools these mortals be!\" But she has an ability, shared with Tracey Emin, to spill her ideas, thoughts and feelings directly on to the page. It is the stuff of bestsellers. </p> <p>\u2022 Joan Bakewell's The View from Here: Life at Seventy is published by Guardian Books.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday October 7 2008. Sheila Hancock is chancellor of Portsmouth University, not Southampton University as we said in this review. This has been corrected.</p>",

He is MP for Barrow and Furness, where Britain's Trident nuclear missile fleet and nuclear-powered submarines are built.

He has been a big Labour party donor and was made a life peer by Tony Blair in 2004, within weeks of donating \u00a3505,000 to the party.

At this point McBride made the transition over into Labour politics.</p> <p>Accusations of bullying by the ruddy-cheeked Arsenal fan are probably too simple. </p> <p>He may just have become a punchbag for an unpopular government.</p> <p>Further changes to the press team see the former head of Ofcom, Stephen Carter, who had been brought in to spruce up the No 10 press operation, moved.

  "<p>Russia and Georgia traded accusations last night over the deadliest attack in South Ossetia since the war two months ago, a car bombing that killed seven Russian troops. Russia's defence ministry blamed Tbilisi for the \"deliberately planned terrorist attack\" and said the explosion was designed to derail an EU-brokered ceasefire deal. </p> <p>But Georgia hit back saying Russian intelligence agencies had plotted the attack outside the headquarters of Russian peacekeeping forces inside the breakaway republic as a pretext for Moscow to keep its troops inside the country.</p> <p>Under the agreement between Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev, Moscow is to pull its troops out over the next six days from the so-called buffer zones next to South Ossetia and Georgia's second breakaway territory of Abkhazia. </p> <p>EU leaders have expressed doubts that Russia intends to abide by the October 10 deadline. They have also said that Moscow's plan to site permanent garrisons inside both territories is a breach of an earlier commitment to return Russian forces to their positions before August's war.</p> <p>Georgia denied Russia's claims last night that it was responsible for the blasts. \"If provocations and tensions are in the interest of anyone, it's the Russians,\" the interior ministry told Reuters. \"They are doing everything not to pull out troops within the set term.\"</p> <p>According to Russian officials, Russian troops detained two cars yesterday afternoon in the ethnic Georgian village of Ditsa about three miles from South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali. They arrested four Georgians and seized light firearms and two grenades, they claimed.</p> <p>\"The cars and the detained people were escorted to Tskhinvali. During the search of one of the cars, an explosive device equivalent to some 20kg of TNT went off,\" a military spokesman told Interfax. The explosion caused devastation, shattering windows 350ft away and sending black smoke into the sky.</p> <p>But it was not clear how a car packed with explosives managed to penetrate an area controlled by Russian troops. The village lies deep inside the buffer zone occupied by the Russian military.</p> <p>Most ethnic Georgians have already fled the area, which has been subjected to looting, killing and ethnic cleansing by South Ossetian militias. The militias have also stolen all the cars, residents say. Additionally, Russian soldiers check all vehicles entering the zone at a series of checkpoints.</p> <p>On Thursday they turned back a European parliamentary convoy.</p> <p>The explosion came three days after unarmed EU observers in light armoured vehicles began patrols in the buffer zone. Under the Sarkozy-Medvedev plan, some 200 European observers are meant to replace Russian forces. </p> <p>But last night South Ossetia's president, Eduard Kokoity, said he had \"no doubt\" that Georgian special forces had carried out the blasts.</p> <p>\"The latest terrorist acts in South Ossetia prove that Georgia has not abandoned its policy of state terrorism,\" he said. \"These actions undermine the efforts of the international community to stabilise the situation in the region and torpedo the Medvedev-Sarkozy peace plan.\"</p>",

  "<p>At some point during the summer of 2000, I had an idea of writing a novel about a love affair between a woman teacher and her teenaged pupil. The infamous Mary Kay Letourneau case had recently been in the US news, and a lot of things about that story had intrigued me - not least the amount of journalistic cant it inspired on the subject of female sexuality and \"appropriate\" sexual relationships. The line that I had in mind when I began writing - the motto for the book, in a way - was one of WH Auden's: \"the desires of the heart are as crooked as corkscrews\".</p> <p>I made a number of false starts with the book - writing it from the teacher's point of view, from an omniscient, third-person perspective and so on - until, a couple of months in, it occurred to me to tell the story in the voice of Barbara, an older colleague and friend of the badly behaved teacher. Philip Roth once described novel-writing as a process of \"problem-solving\", and for me, the discovery of Barbara offered a solution to several problems all at once. It was a great \"aha!\" moment. I felt straight away that I knew Barbara inside out, that I \"had\" her voice. It was one of those rare instances in my writing life when I was positively eager to get to the computer and start work every day. Perhaps the most useful thing that Barbara gave me was a way of opening the book up and complicating things. Suddenly I had a new way of showing love's crooked ways, but I also had a weird, charismatic narrator, and a new range of Barbara-related subjects - childlessness, loneliness, old age - to write about.</p> <p>One often hears critics praise particular novelists for being \"in control\" of their material - by which they mean, I suppose, that the novelists in question have marshalled their themes and characters and so on, in a confident, surefooted way. As a writer, though, I am wary of feeling too in control. If I know exactly what I'm doing and what a book is \"saying\" at any given moment, the chances are the thing I'm writing will be dead on the page. Ideally, I want to feel as if I'm overseeing a big, unruly classroom and only just managing to keep order.</p> <p>It took me two years to finish Notes - I am a pathetically slow writer - and during that time, I showed it to no one but my husband. When I finally sent it out to publishers, I received what is politely known as a \"mixed\" response. My loyal editor at Viking, Juliet Annan, made an offer on it, but seven or eight publishers in the US rejected it. And I received an awful reader's report from somewhere that ended with the heartbreaking line: \"With a lot of work, this could be a quite interesting book - but only quite.\" </p> <p>Many of the first readers objected to what they saw as Barbara's unmitigated unpleasantness. Several people expressed the view that \"there was no one to like\" in the book. I was then - and I remain - unsure how to answer these complaints. Part of me feels that I have failed if I have not managed to conjure any sympathy for my flawed, difficult characters. And part of me feels that the complaining readers are the ones at fault for bringing to fiction misplaced expectations of finding \"nice people\".</p> <p>Happily, Notes went on to find a publisher in the US, although, rather maddeningly, it ended up being published under another title: What Was She Thinking? (I hated the idea of giving the book two different English-language titles, but the Americans were adamant that Notes on a Scandal sounded like a non-fiction book about the Clinton presidency.) </p> <p>Looking back now on some of the early, unfavourable responses to the book, I suspect that they had a rather salutary effect on me. Having your work occasionally rejected - or poorly reviewed - is not a bad thing for a writer. Naturally, it's horrid at the time, but it does toughen you up. It also forces you to decide whether you're in the game for the long haul or not.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter from America No 2627, June 18 1999 </strong></p> <p>When you see on television some protest rally, I mean a spontaneous protest - people suddenly taking to the streets, brandishing fists, howling insults, waving posters - do you ever wonder who planned the spontaneousness of it all. </p> <p>This struck me with new force this week when we saw everywhere - on television, the front pages of every newspaper, the cover stories on magazines - the face of a sweet old lady with golden spectacles, her white hair swept up and topped off with a ropey knot, sitting alongside the President of the United States and speaker of the House. She is the heroine of a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, where, before an audience of about a thousand and the Congress (including a senator in his 90s who, 44 years ago, was the old lady's bitterest enemy), Miss Rosa Parks was awarded a rare honour, the Congressional Gold Medal, as a \"living icon for freedom in America\". </p> <p>Let us, to use the Victorian novelists' fancy phrase, turn back the pages of history to see how and when and why this old black lady, now 86, earned this singular honour. </p> <p>By the grace of my beloved, long-gone editor there is on my shelves a little pamphlet, brown-edged with age, a collection of reprinted daily dispatches of mine from the south, written from various towns in the spring of 1956 - two years after the supreme court abolished the segregation of the races and one year after a bus boycott in the capital city, Montgomery, state of Alabama. If you don't already know the facts of that famous boycott, they are simply told. </p> <p>On a December day in 1955, four blacks went aboard a city bus and sat where they'd never sat before, in the forward section reserved always for whites. The bus driver, following the city law, asked them to move to the back. The three men complied. The fourth, a woman, refused. </p> <p>A firm, upright little woman of 42, she was asked again, and once more said no. If the bus driver had decided to make nothing of it, he could have been prosecuted for flouting the city law, and the company could lose its licence. This was well understood on both sides. </p> <p>The bus driver called two policemen, and still refusing to budge, she was arrested and taken off, charged and released. I put this down just as flatly as that in my piece. I didn't even print her name. It was, of course, Rosa Parks. And the legend has grown and shone and blazed, of one coloured woman who took it upon herself on a whim to stand out at last against the separation of blacks and whites on a southern bus. </p> <p>In that original piece, and right after that humdrum recital of the facts, I find this sentence: \"That same afternoon, thousands of printed handbills mysteriously dropped on the doorsteps of the coloured homes in the neighborhood urging a boycott of the bus line, to begin two days later.\" And so it did, and went on for over a year, till the blacks got more reforms than they had protested and sued for. </p> <p>In shorter words, Miss Rosa Parks's decision to stay in a forward seat was the first move in a planned boycott of the bus company and the city law, a campaign organised long before by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and run by a young, bland, handsome black parson, name of Martin Luther King Jr, who while I was in Montgomery, flew in from Atlanta twice a week to buy little vans for use by the boycotters. </p> <p>We could leave it there, having made the seemingly mean point that Miss Rosa Parks just happened to be chosen as the cat's-paw or dupe of a boycott campaign well planned beforehand. Well, it's not so. She did the choosing. She was not just another bus rider. She was the secretary of a city chapter of the NAACP 12 years before she stood, or sat, her ground in 1955. The first time she was thrown off a bus was for using the white entrance - at the front. That takes us back to 1943, the middle of the second world war, in which her brother had served both in Europe and in the Pacific. He came home unhurt, but she watched in disgust, helpless disgust, to see her brother, in uniform, picked out by rednecks, or white trash, for especially bigoted treatment. From that time on, she was a prominent civil rights activist (this is all, remember, 10 or more years before the supreme court's ruling abolishing segregation). May 1954 is always given, and rightly, as the Bastille Day - the day that started the revolution for equal black rights. </p> <p>Well, only a couple of months before Rosa Parks chose to be the cat's-paw on that bus, she heard the sickening news (it sickened this country) of a black teenage boy from Chicago who had been murdered just for being found, a northerner, walking through a town in Mississippi. The white men who killed him on a lark were acquitted by an all-white jury. Rosa Parks, the 86-year-old lady, so belatedly honoured, now recalls: \"It was not that I was just fed up in December 1955. I'd been fed up my whole life, as far back as I can remember, with being treated as less than a free person.\" So, she stayed put on that bus, knowing there'd be unpleasant treatment, and nasty telephone calls. She didn't know she and her husband would receive death threats for another 12 years, which forced them, eventually, to move to the middle west, to Detroit. It wasn't the end of her activism. She joined the 1963 March on Washington, was on the frightening but now famous march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the city of her notoriety and her persecution and, now, her glory. </p> <p>So, after all, Rosa Parks was no accidental heroine. For her, December 1955 was not the start of anything. It was the end of her rope, the last straw of her tolerance of harassment and shaming and white beastliness. That gold medal and that resolution of Congress passed in April were little enough compensation for a lifetime's crime - of being black.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter from America No 1781, April 1 1983</strong></p> <p>One day he's the screaming eagle, the next he's a purring dove. These quick-change roles can best be illustrated by two speeches the president made in the past week or two, which express a puzzling or maybe two puzzling sides of his character. </p> <p>First, let me say that whatever else he is, Mr Reagan is nothing remotely as shivery and calculating as he appears in the puppet shows and horrendous caricatures paraded by the unilateralists and others who claim a monopoly on sincerity and peace-mongering. He is so amiable, so genial and thoughtful, that there are Democrats who've resolved not to accept social invitations to the White House for fear of being infected and debauched by the president's sunny and beguiling manner. </p> <p>But between one day and the next, between a happy morning meeting in the White House and an evening speech somewhere off in the country, Mr Reagan, having given everybody the idea that he's going to play it cool on this policy or that, then appears in Florida or Texas and starts to exhale fire and brimstone.</p> <p>The \"Star Wars\" speech and the \"Darth Vader\" speech are rather frightening examples. The Darth Vader speech - and that's what, for convenient filing, the White House calls it - was the one the president gave before that throbbing audience of evangelicals in Florida, in which he called the Soviet Union \"the evil empire run by Godless men\". After he'd left Florida, with the applause still tingling in his ears, Mr Reagan was astonished to read and hear that the speech, and most of all the characterisation of the Soviet Union, was deplored of course abroad, but all around the United States as well. </p> <p>Then whether by accident or design, but I'd guess by the natural trend of his character to make impulsive amends, he made what they call his \"Star Wars\" speech. That was the one in which he foresaw, and even proposed, an anti-ballistic system that would have laser beams exploding, way up in the sky, any missiles the enemy cared to launch. There's no doubt, I think, that the president thought of this as a friendly suggestion. He went so far as to say that once the thing was perfected, he'd be happy to share it with the Soviets, provided, </p> <p>I imagine, they are prepared to wait so long. The president says it may take till the end of the century, or beyond, before we've got this trick in perfect shape.</p> <p>The Russians - Mr General Secretary Yuri Andropov, that is to say - responded to both speeches, the nasty one and the nice one, in one breath, which is not surprising. Call a man the leader of an evil empire, of a country also described as \"the focus of evil\" in the world, and you shouldn't be surprised if he comes back and calls you a liar and a lunatic.</p> <p>Then, having vented his proper spleen, Mr Andropov got down to the substance of the Star Wars proposal. He said it violated the 1972 Soviet-American anti-ballistic missile treaty. Not so, Mr Reagan said. The United States was not testing or manufacturing such things yet. You may wonder, as I did, whether this treaty is distinct and separate from the first Salt (strategic arms limitation) treaty of the same year. No matter. </p> <p>I finally dug out the text, and this is what that Salt treaty says: \"Each party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy anti-ballistic missile systems or components, which are sea-based, air-based, space-based, or mobile land-based.\" Well, Mr Reagan is offering to develop, at least, an anti-ballistic missile system, assuming a laser is a missile that is space-based. Clearly, wouldn't you say Mr Andropov is correct? A conclusion we shouldn't be hesitant about, even if Mr Andropov is Darth Vader.</p> <h2>Playing chess</h2> <p><strong>Letter No 1991, April 17 1987</strong></p> <p>I was sitting down to lunch in New York with a man of venerable years and a great range of interests ... He is also, you might say, a professional talker.</p> <p>I asked my companion how he felt about the general line or drift of the arms control talks so far; that means after the summit in Reykjavik between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. The old man looked at the slice of lime bobbing like a lifeboat amid the icebergs of his tomato juice, and he shot me a sly smile. \"Did I ever tell you,\" he asked, \"about my first encounter with the Canadian chess player?\" </p> <p>The required answer is, \"Of course not, please do tell.\" I gave it.</p> <p>\"Well,\" he said, \"I'd just arrived as a young American student at the London School of Economics. I soon discovered that there was a permanent group of maniacal chess players. One day, a young-middle-aged pleasant man came up to me. He asked me if I'd like to play a game. I beat him easily. Next day, we played again. This time, I beat him in a dozen moves. </p> <p>I went off to drinks with some other students, and they greeted me as if I'd been Alekhine or Capablanca. 'Is it true,' they asked, 'that you twice slaughtered the Canadian?' They were aghast and agog. He was the Canadian chess champion.</p> <p>\"When I ran into him again, he offered me a game. From then on, we played certainly once a week for the next three years. Every time I was massacred.\" </p> <p>The old man neatly rescued the lime, squeezed it, and looked at me sideways, expecting me to say, \"How come?\" I said, \"How come?\"</p> <p>\"Well, the first two times, the Canadian assumed he was playing with, if not a champion, with somebody within hailing distance of his standard. He noticed a rather startling move or two of mine and decided I was a bold but calculating player. Because he was attributing to me this sophistication, his expertise was fatal. Evidently, he talked later with some of the boys and discovered he'd been beaten by a tyro. After that, the three-year blitz.\" </p> <p>I said, \"You know, I wrote a piece years ago ... if I had a thesis, it was that Russians are the best chess players in the world, and we always interpret their motives as if they were playing draughts.\" \"That's it,\" the old man said. </p> <p>\"At Reykjavik, Ronald Reagan was me, and Mikhail Gorbachev was the champion of all the Russias. He must have been totally thrown when Reagan blurted out, 'Why not abolish all nuclear weapons?' What was this cunning move? Reagan, of course, had never dreamed of offering to abolish all nuclear weapons. He got carried away.\"</p> <p>Since then, Mr Gorbachev has seen that Mr Reagan was carried away not by cunning but by ideology. Mr Gorbachev has accordingly been able to go back to his own game.</p>",
  "<p>Tarsem Dhandwar Singh eyes the machine whirring on the table. In the modern world, MP3 recorders are taking over, but some still prefer the comfort of a big, chunky cassette recorder. \"It's safer,\" he nods. \"It's like making a movie: when you're using film, it can be OK. But with digital, it's either there or it's all just zeroes and ones; it's gone. You don't get bad quality, you get nothing!\" It's fitting, then, that Singh's new film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125867/fall\">The Fall</a>, is rooted in olden times, a film that's set in the early days of cinema but, in an unexpected way, goes way further.</p> <p>Singh, known professionally just as Tarsem, has crafted a dazzling, funny and surprisingly emotional fantasy about a little girl named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru, then six) who befriends a bedridden stuntman named Roy (Lee Pace) in a 1920s California hospital. Roy is suicidal after a love affair has gone wrong, and to cajole the little girl into stealing deadly morphine for him he spins her a long-winded yarn about an evil governor and the five mythic heroes (including a masked bandit, Charles Darwin and a freed slave) who pursue him. \"It's one hell of a tearjerker if you run with it,\" says Singh, \"because Catinca is so amazing. But if you don't fall in love with her then you'll be so alienated that everything else just looks like a visual wank!\"</p> <p>He laughs, as well he might, because it's finally his turn to shine. Until recently, Singh was a bit of a joke, a one-name director, like McG and Pitof (remember Catwoman?), with just one film under his belt - the critically derided Jenifer Lopez serial killer flick, The Cell, at that. \"People always think it didn't do well,\" he says, \"but it was the popcorn film of the year. It's eye candy. One question I had at the time was: 'Is there anything that doesn't feel real to you in this movie?' I said, 'You tell me, because if there's anything real in this film I'll take it out! It's got J.Lo as a fucking shrink!'\"</p> <p>Those people probably thought that The Cell's drubbing threw the 47-year-old Punjab-born director out of the game, but what they didn't know was that, for Singh, it was the other way round. As far as he was concerned he'd opted in for a while, taking a respite from his dream project, The Fall, a film that had already been over a decade and a half in the planning and was being shot piecemeal in over 24 countries, with money from the director's own pocket. Originally, he'd had meetings with producers, but after turning up with no script and no timespan, just a box of nick-nacks like the one Alexandria carries in the film, Singh realised he couldn't honestly expect them to part with any cash. \"It was quite ridiculous,\" he admits. </p> <p>He wound up making the film in instalments while shooting for ads for Nike, Levi's and Coca-Cola, jobs he landed after a short but impressive run of music videos for the likes of En Vogue, Vanessa Paradis and, most notably, REM (Losing My Religion). </p> <p>Loosely based on a 1981 Bulgarian film Singh had seen only once called Yo Ho Ho, to which he bought the remake rights and never watched again, The Fall is a labour of love that's taken him from Brazil to Cambodia, from Fiji to Uttar Pradesh, and everywhere in between. \"There are no parking lots where I shoot,\" he grins. \"I had this idea close to 23 years ago now. I thought of it as a story from before cinema, even before recorded music. From a time when the story that you told, or the music you played, was so much dependent on the person in front of you - not like a painting, or a film, where you put something out and people come to see it. Storytelling was always about who you told it to. If they were leaning forward, making eye contact, you milked it: you knew what they liked. And if they started to lean back, you knew what they didn't like.\" </p> <p>From what you might have read about Singh, you could be forgiven for thinking he's some Ray-Banned Hollywood tosser, but he's not. He's a wiry, candid and frequently hilarious raconteur who has kept every lovely sing-song cadence of his Indian accent. \"I came to film very late,\" he says. \"I was at a boarding school in the Himalayas. My dad was in Iran, he was an engineer, and at our school we had three months holiday because the school would be snowed in. I travelled a lot as a child because he was in the airlines. But when I said I wanted to study film he was furious. I was 19 or 20, and I'd seen a book called Film Schools In America. I was shocked because I thought you only went to school to study something you hated and your parents loved!</p> <p>\"My father said, 'There's no way you're going abroad until you've got a degree!'\" he recalls. \"So I got a degree in business. Never went to college; I lied, cheated, had other people sit through my exams ... everything! In those days you couldn't see film that much in India because there wasn't much VHS, but in the meantime I read up everything I could on cinema from libraries. I was familiar with practically every film ever made without having seen them, so I was dying to get abroad so I could see them and figure out the physics of the camera. Then one year I went to Vancouver for a holiday, and I called up my father and said, 'I'm going to study film.' He just said, 'You don't exist any more.' So I went down to LA, started three jobs while putting myself through college, and I loved it. It took a stick and shovel to get me out of there. I wouldn't leave! I didn't want to go out and work - I just wanted to see movies every day.\"</p> <p>Singh's devotion to the moving image - in the US, he went to one regional film school with an unlikely fake ID as \"Randy Marsh\" to qualify - is obvious in The Fall, which attracted Hollywood mavericks David Fincher and Spike Jonze as executive producers (\"We started out in commercials and music videos together,\" he explains). </p> <p>But, though Singh claims there is no CGI in his breathtakingly visual film, he is more reluctant to give up the secrets that went into creating the heartbreaking performance by little Catinca, a Romanian girl whose discovery rushed the film into production. </p> <p>He has been asked whether he used the old Hollywood trick used on child stars: telling them their dog has died, which amuses him no end. \"This film is beyond killing dogs!\" he roars. \"If you think you can get a performance out of a child just by telling them their dog is dead, you're much mistaken! If I told you all the [tricks] I had to [play],\" he jokes, \"I would probably be sued like mad! But I loved that girl, and she and her mother are still very close to me. It's just that in the west, I think, the pendulum has swung too far the wrong way. People think that children are so vulnerable. When they cry after you take something away from them, that's the equivalent to you of your house burning down. But then 10 minutes later they're like, 'OK, what's for lunch?' It's only the adults that can't handle it, and I had that conversation with her mother.\"</p> <p>Catinca's performance will be uncomfortable for many western audiences, but Singh thinks it's time the cosy Hollywood supremacy was challenged. \"Anybody in Europe who tries to compete directly with Hollywood will die,\" he says, \"because they'll just spend more money on it. But things like Hindi cinema have evolved from a different angle, and they've survived because of it. </p> <p>\"In the west, for example, you don't mix opera and film. If someone is 44 he won't play himself as a 12 or 14-year-old, but he will in a Hindi movie. If he's fat and ugly, people will still call him beautiful. In opera you'd accept that, but you don't accept it in cinema. In the middle of a really serious situation, a dog can have a flashback in a Hindi movie. It is still played seriously, but in the west you wouldn't. So I decided that if I went far back enough, and found a time where all rules were open to me, I could evolve a language in the storytelling that was completely free.\"</p> <p>The result is one of the most beguiling and rewarding follies ever made. Sadly, Singh's estranged father, who died three years ago, never saw his son's masterwork, but the director remains upbeat, even though he has yet to be completely vindicated. \"There are people who say, 'It's the best thing since fucking sliced bread,'\" he says, \"and others are going, 'It's absolute pretentious crap!' Me, I'm just thinking, 'Well, that's OK.'\" He grins: \"As long as it's not, 'Comme ci, comme \u00e7a!'\"</p> <p>\u2022 The Fall is out now</p>",

  "<p>The cartoonist Boris Yefimov, who has died at 108, could count himself lucky, both physically and politically, to have survived to such an age. As a satirist who drew political cartoons for the Communist party daily Izvestia, the satirical magazine Krokodil, and Pravda, he risked falling prey to the shifting allegiances and paranoid volte-faces of Josef Stalin's rule, but he remained astutely uninvolved in Communist party politics and, like Stalin, who once personally amended one of his drawings, understood that cartoons \"to a certain extent were weapons\", and ones that he was happy to deploy in the service of the Soviet Union, during the second world war and the subsequent cold war.</p> <p>It was Yefimov's brutal depictions of a battered German army, held back at the gates of Moscow, and a shrunken, cowering Hitler, for which he will probably be best remembered. In one cartoon, published in 1941, wounded soldiers carry a coffin, inscribed Myth of the Invincibility of the German Army, through the snow as they retreat. Another shows a shrunken Hitler reduced to playing a barrel organ on the street. Cartoons urging German soldiers to surrender were also dropped behind enemy lines. He was granted a ringside seat at the Nuremburg war crimes trials and then turned his satirical eye on the Soviet Union's new enemies, the US.</p> <p>Stalin personally commissioned a cartoon of a triumphalist Dwight Eisenhower laying claim to the north pole, and then took a red pen to it to add his own amendments. The picture was the centrepiece of Yefimov's many mementoes of his professional life in the central Moscow flat from where he watched the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Much of his biography suggests he was lucky to have played such a central role under Stalin. He survived a brutal regime that made his brother and many acquaintances enemies of the people, subject to imprisonment, deportation or execution.</p> <p>Yefimov was born Boris Fridland, the second son of a Jewish shoemaker in Kiev, though the family moved west to Bialystok (now in Poland). Drawing was a hobby, and he intended to become a lawyer until the first world war and Bolshevik revolution of 1917 intervened. Caught up in the turmoil of revolutionary Kiev, which saw power change 12 times, he began to draw political cartoons to vent his frustration at the chaos. It was in Kiev that he witnessed the fiery oratory of Leon Trotsky, the creator of the Red Army.</p> <p>Like his brother, Mikhail, he became a follower of the Bolshevik cause. When Mikhail moved to Moscow to work as a journalist, he encouraged his younger brother to join him and got him a job as an agitprop cartoonist working for Pravda, producing propaganda posters for the new regime. He changed his name to Yefimov to conceal his Jewish background.</p> <p>He met Vladimir Illitch Lenin, but it was to Trotsky, then effectively Lenin's number two, that he was drawn. In 1924 his first book of caricatures was published, with a foreword by Trotsky, the man who was about to be excised from Soviet history and later murdered at Stalin's behest. Though the book's publisher was subsequently executed for his political mistakes, Yefimov survived. In the 1930s, the era of Stalin's great terror and the purges, he portrayed \"enemies of the people\", attended show trials in the Hall of Columns in Moscow and watched as many of his acquaintances and later his brother, then a prominent editor, were denounced and later shot by Stalin's secret police.</p> <p>The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 made Yefimov's work in many ways easier. In a country where many were illiterate and images were deployed as the most straightforward propaganda, it was through his front-page cartoons of the Nazi hierarchy that many ordinary Soviet citizens became familiar with their enemies. Interviewed for his 100th birthday, he underlined the aesthetic value of his work: \"A truly artistic caricature conveys the character and conduct of the person it depicts,\" adding later: \"A cartoon instantaneously gives you both the event and the commentary about that event. That is the nature of a cartoon; fast, funny and persuasive.\"</p> <p>As the cold war intensified, Yefimov turned his sights on the west, portraying Winston Churchill and Harry Truman as aggressors, a change of outlook that he adapted to philosophically, although he retained respect for Churchill as a statesman - and never put him in the same league as Hitler or Goebbels.</p> <p>He saw his role as simply performing a task for the political hierarchy while the \"simple people ... didn't do politics\", obeying orders for fear of being \"brushed away like pawns\". In another interview he spoke of his attitude to Stalin: \"He was a villain. He murdered many innocent people, a dreadful man. But still, a certain human logic wins out. He is also the person who granted me my life, my freedom, my work.\"</p> <p>In later life, Yefimov enjoyed his role as eyewitness to 20th-century Russian history. He recalled the figures he saw and met: as a child he saw Tsar Nicholas II, and later met the Bolshevik theorist Nikolai Bukharin - also executed at the behest of Stalin - and the writer Maxim Gorky. And he talked of his relationship to Stalin. </p> <p>He continued to produce gently humorous cartoons into his last years. On his 107th birthday he was given the title of chief cartoonist of Izvestia in recognition of 80 years work for the paper. Questioned once on the role of the propaganda that he had produced, he said he saw it as one of the definitive forces that had shaped ordinary Soviet citizens' attitudes to their country. \"Propaganda was born together with the Soviet regime in 1917, and through all 70 years of its existence, propaganda helped to consolidate society, held it in some kind of unified, strong community. And when the Soviet Union disappeared and propaganda disappeared with it, there was left a sort of emptiness.\"</p> <p>He was married twice and had one son. </p> <p>\u2022 Boris Yefimov, cartoonist, born September 28 1900; died October 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>I had gone to hear a lecture at a museum - a sedate affair you might think - but, as I took my place in the auditorium, I had no idea of the insane micro-drama about to unfold. It was only when the curator stepped up to the podium that the truth about the evening began to unfold. </p> <p><strong>Curator</strong> (stern look on his face suggesting antiquities in peril) \"After the talk there will be a 10-minute comfort break, during which refreshments will not be available. But I must ask those of you here with children to keep them under control. Two children have already been found loose in the museum shop this evening, and that is unacceptable.\"</p> <p>There was a pause while people tried to gauge how serious he was.</p> <p><strong>Curator</strong> (looking the entire room in the eye) \"Theft is theft.\"</p> <p>Some people started laughing at this point. </p> <p><strong>Curator</strong> (somewhere between pity and disdain) \"You might think this is funny, but I can assure you it isn't. This isn't funny. We have CCTV and if anything else happens, then I can promise you that appropriate action will be taken.\" </p> <p>During the \"comfort break\" I made a point of seeking out the curator, who was being confronted by the accused kids' father.</p> <p><strong>Dad</strong> \"Do you think this an appropriate way to react? Is this what's in your training?\"</p> <p><strong>Curator</strong> \"What about your training as a parent. What about that?\" </p> <p>The dad just stood there, open-mouthed while the curator stared at him with a look that suggested that he would stab anyone else who came near the shop to death with a souvenir pencil.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities in the United States are reeling from a sudden spate of children being abandoned by their parents and guardians under a new law that allows caregivers to leave any child up to the age of 19 at hospitals without fear of prosecution.</p> <p>In Nebraska in September alone, 14 children were abandoned in hospitals and another was mistakenly taken to a police station, which is not covered under the law. In a further case, an 18-year-old presented himself for safe keeping, but was not placed in foster care because he was too old.</p> <p>The case that has caused most attention has been that of a father who handed over nine of his 10 children aged 20 months to 17 years to hospital carers. They have been placed with two sets of relatives before their fate is decided.</p> <p>In July Nebraska became the last of the 50 states to pass legislation designed to take criminality out of the abandonment of babies and infants, following a reported rise in such incidents. The process began with Texas, which enacted the law in 1999, and since then about 2,000 babies are thought to have been handed over nationwide.</p> <p>The Nebraska law, however, went further than that of any other state in keeping loose the definition of those who could be relinquished by their carers. In most states, it was restricted to the early months of life, but in Nebraska it has been left open as any age up to 19.</p> <p>The first to make use of the law was a woman in Omaha who tried on September 1 to part company with her 14-year-old son, saying she did not want to care for him any more. She made the mistake, under the terms of the legislation, of presenting him at Omaha police department.</p> <p>On September 13 a woman took her 11-year-old grandson to a hospital in Omaha complaining he was violent and destructive and saying he would be better off in a group home. The boy is now in foster care. The same day a boy aged 15 was abandoned in Lincoln by his aunt, who said he was disobedient and a possible gang member. \"I didn't abandon him,\" she told the Omaha World Herald. \"I wanted help for him so when he hits 18 he's not a menace to society.\"</p> <p>Two further cases occurred on September 20 and 23 involving a girl aged 13 and the 18-year-old who presented himself. The next day, in two incidents, relatives walked away from a boy aged 11 and another of 15.</p> <p>The same day Gary Staton turned up at Creighton University medical centre with all but the eldest of his 10 children.

  "<h2>Nobel author dismisses protests by blind people</h2> <p>Nobel laureate Jos\u00e9 Saramago yesterday dismissed a threat by a US association of blind people to picket cinemas showing a film version of his book Blindness as \"a display of meanness based on nothing at all\". The Portuguese writer said his 1995 novel, which depicts an epidemic that causes people to see nothing but white light, resulting in a collapse of social order, was an allegory depicting \"a blindness of rationality\". Marc Maurer, president of the Baltimore-based National Federation of the Blind, said the film, released yesterday, \"portrays blind people as monsters, and I believe it to be a lie\".<br><strong>Associated Press in Lisbon</strong></p> <h2>Boy, 7, feeds zoo lizards to crocodile in killing spree</h2> <p>A seven-year-old boy broke into the Alice Springs Reptile Centre in central Australia, fed animals to the resident crocodile and beat several lizards to death with a rock, the zoo's director, Rex Neindorf, said yesterday. The boy, who was caught on security cameras, killed three lizards, including the zoo's 20-year-old goanna, which he then fed to a 3.3-metre (11ft) saltwater crocodile known as Terry. He also threw live animals to the crocodile. The boy, who killed 13 animals worth about A$7,000 (\u00a33,065) in the 30-minute attack, has been identified but cannot be charged under local law because of his age.<br><strong>Associated Press in Sydney</strong></p> <h2>Wreckage confirmed as wartime submarine</h2> <p>The US navy has confirmed that the wreckage of a submarine found last year off the Aleutian Islands is that of the USS Grunion, which disappeared during the second world war. Underwater footage and pictures captured by a team hired by sons of the commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Mannert Abele, confirmed the discovery, the navy said. Seventy crew were aboard the Grunion, which was last heard of on July 30 1942, when it reported anti-submarine activity near the island of Kiska.

  "<p>What's green, economical and reduces congestion? The answer is cyber hitching \u2013 websites, such as <a href=\"http://www.carshare.com\">carshare.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.liftshare.org\">liftshare.org</a>, that put travellers in touch with car drivers to share journeys and petrol costs. And in these times of financial uncertainty, they are racking up a huge global following. </p> <p>Hitchhiking has long been a cheap but unreliable mode of travel, but the advantage of finding a lift online is that, rather than just sticking out your thumb and hoping for the best, you can find out about your driver in advance, consider compatibility, and check references left by other travellers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Avego.com\">Avego.com</a> is the latest site to emerge and looks set to be the most hi-tech. Their service, which is currently recruiting beta testers, allows drivers to use GPS-enabled Apple iPhones to register their location/destination and be matched with like-minded passengers, who can use any \"common cell phone\" to send lift requests via text. </p> <p>Traditional hitching also appears to be undergoing an internet-fuelled revival.

With a little planning, travellers should be able to share lifts safely, rather than taking the chance of traditional hitchhiking.\"</p> <p>Broom recommends asking for references, swapping identity documents before getting in the car, and adds, \"If a situation feels wrong, don't get in.\" </p> <p>The current rising star in online ridesharing is <a href=\"http://www.PickupPal.com\">PickupPal.com</a>, described by its founders as an \"eBay for transportation\", where passengers request a lift and drivers set a fee.

  "<p>What should we do about Dr Fredrick T\u00f6ben, detained at Heathrow this week under a fast-track EU arrest warrant issued by the district court in Mannheim? <br><br>Dr who? I know, it's been a busy week, and I hadn't heard of him either until he popped up to be remanded in custody by Westminster magistrates. By the time you read this he may be on a plane to Germany \u2013 or home to Australia.</p> <p>T\u00f6ben is a 64-year-old German-born historian who runs something called the Adelaide Institute. He denies frequent accusations that he is a Holocaust denier, but judging by some of the things he says and writes he makes a pretty good job of passing himself off as one. Phrases like \"Holocaust racketeers, the corpse peddlers and the Shoah business merchants\" characterise some of his scholarship.</p> <p>In other words he believes that the six-million-dead German Holocaust which took place during the 1933-45 Hitler regime, a well-documented narrative accepted by most historians, did not occur, or did so on a much smaller scale. If you challenge the Holocaust you must expect persecution and abuse, he says.</p> <p>Well, plenty of people, not all of them Jewish, have pursued him during a teaching career on three continents \u2013 from New Zealand to Nigeria. In 1999 he served nine months in a German prison for breaching the Holocaust law there that forbids the \"defaming of the dead\" in this way. Needless to add, T\u00f6ben attended the Holocaust revisionist conference held in Tehran in 2006.</p> <p>A nasty piece of work by the sound of it, and some nasty websites are exercised on T\u00f6ben's behalf. </p> <p>Why should we care? Two strands of the affair trouble me. One is the restriction on free speech inherent in the laws that some countries \u2013 not Britain \u2013 have against Holocaust denial. We have broader laws against racial incitement in general, which seems acceptable to me, though not to those who believe that older public order laws would have proved sufficient.</p> <p>I can see why the Germans felt the need to enact such specific legislation. After all, they did it, and have an obligation to discharge the historic debt, something, incidentally, they have done pretty well \u2013 at least in the old West Germany \u2013 over the years. </p> <p>In other countries, several across Europe, such law smacks of \"exceptionalism\", special pleading in a world where diverse historic injustices abound. In Turkey you can get into trouble for saying there was a holocaust against the Armenians in 1915. In Iran they call us hypocrites for being selective in our championship of free speech.</p> <p>The other problem I have with this is process. When the European Arrest Warrant came into force in 2004 to help police fight cross border crime - and post 9/11 terrorism - more effectively it abolished the \"dual criminality\" principle.</p> <p>That had meant that a suspect could not be extradited for an alleged offence that was not an offence in the country where he/she had been detained. When Britain joined the new procedure ministers assured critics who feared Kafkaesque possibilities that no one would be extradited for actions legal in Britain, let alone crimes they didn't know existed.</p> <p>But here we have it: T\u00f6ben taken off a plane at Heathrow and quick to protest that he is the victim of a legal ambush, an abuse of process in a country which has not - yet - succumbed to Germany's \"witch-hunt mentality\" in this matter. Food for thought there that makes me uncomfortable. </p> <p>I am also aware of German courts, in cases involving disputed custody cases where one parent is German, behaving pretty badly towards the claims of a non-German spouse. Catherine Meyer, wife of Chris Meyer, former British ambassador to both Bonn and Washington, did not see her \"kidnapped' children for years.</p> <p>Holocaust denial is a lesser offence than involvement in war crimes themselves. Britain has a different problem here in that, in the chaos after 1945 when it was often hard to sort victim from persecutor, a lot of bad people slipped into this country and led quiet, guilty lives. </p> <p>In 1991 Margaret Thatcher used the parliament acts to override the House of Lords, which had thrown out her war crimes bill, passed by the Commons. The average age of current MPs in 1939 was six, one peer remarked during the debate: let it go. But some 300 suspects live on in the UK, countered the bill's supporters.</p> <p>At the time I sympathised with the critics. It was all a long time ago, witnesses and accused were old, far away or even dead, their memories faulty at best. We should not forget, but it smacked of retrospective legislation, pandering again. </p> <p>Last time I looked there had not been a single successful prosecution. Other more recent war crimes dominate the headlines. Who's right?</p>",

  "<p>The company that introduced the concept of buy-to-let hotel rooms, boasting that investors could \"earn money while others sleep\", fell into administration yesterday. </p> <p>GuestInvest owned Blakes Hotel in London's Mayfair and was developing a string of other hotels, including one on the site of the former Whitbread Brewery in the City of London. HBOS owned 19.9% of the company.</p> <p>Hundreds of investors paid upwards of \u00a3250,000 for a GuestInvest hotel room where they earned 50% of the room rate plus the right to stay for 52 nights a year. The rooms at Blakes were on sale for \u00a31m each but were rumoured to have found few buyers. </p> <p>Its advertisements were plastered across London's transport network and initially, while hotel occupancy rates were buzzing and finance was cheap, investors earned returns of about 10% a year. </p> <p>In 2006, founder Johnny Sandelson entered into a \u00a3140m joint venture with HBOS to finance new acquisitions, and brought in financier Sir Mark Weinberg as a non-executive director.

  "<p>A few weeks ago, I walked into a fabulous, gilt-trimmed room in the heart of Manhattan and had tea with Sex And The City's very own Samantha. It's hard to have a more New York experience than that ... Except the woman who greets me in the Edison Ballroom - looking the very spit of Samantha, with blond bob, one-shouldered red dress and matching high heels - talks with a Midlands accent and, far from being a sharp-shooting, fast-talking PR (as Samantha was), she is, in fact, Kate Bostock, executive director of fashion at Marks &amp; Spencer. It's hard to get more British than that.</p> <p>The spectre of Sex And The City should come as no surprise: Bostock is clad in an eye-catching number from the forthcoming Patricia Field at Marks &amp; Spencer collection, designed by the show's fashion stylist. What is surprising is that the dress is from Marks &amp; Sparks and that this high street behemoth, associated more with the British basics look of David Cameron than the over-the-top fabulousness of Sarah Jessica Parker, should have joined forces with Field.</p> <p>Bostock had for some time been after a celebrity/designer alliance, similar to the one Topshop has with Kate Moss and H&amp;M had with Stella McCartney. Those collaborations make sense - every Topshop girl wants to dress like Moss - but wouldn't Judi Dench or Sandra Howard have been more obvious choices for M&amp;S? Bostock disagrees, saying, \"Sex And The City is definitely an interest of our customers\" - just as well, seeing how similar many of the clothes in the collection are to those in the film, from the corsages to the slinky disco dresses. \"Just as I hoped,\" Bostock says.</p> <p>It was, in fact, Field who approached M&amp;S, not the other way round. \"The whole idea behind the collection was to make fashion accessible to the mass market,\" says Andreas Brill, the man in charge of Field's production and marketing. But why M&amp;S? \"Well, it has superior production quality.\"</p> <p>When Field, who has been preparing for her fashion show that evening, joins Bostock on the sofa - a scarlet-haired sixtysomething, an impressive three hours late and wearing a sparkly blue minidress - she says \"of course\" she'd heard of M&amp;S: \"People told me, if you go to London, you've got to buy some Marks &amp; Spencer underwear.\" Bostock shifts a little awkwardly in her chair.</p> <p>Field has been on the fringes of the fashion business since 1966, when she opened her now infamous store, a mix of vintage finds and camp clubwear, so central to the downtown New York scene of the era that it hosted Jean-Michel Basquiat's debut exhibition. Reminiscing about the days of disco, when she danced all night at legendary clubs such as Studio 54, Field smiles and leans back. \"I loved the energy of the disco era. Everyone so up and happy.\"</p> <p>Despite wearing a disco outfit and tottering Dior heels in the middle of the day, Field, who was raised in New York by \"my grandmother, my aunts, my mother\", was never really interested in fashion and got into the business only \"because I found it easy\". After graduating with a liberal arts degree, she saw an advert for \"college graduate trainee junior whatever\" at a New York department store and thought, \"I can do that.\" So she did.</p> <p>She started designing in 1970, when she couldn't find the clothes she wanted to sell in her store. Today, stocked with her own designs and those of smaller labels, it is like the fantasy of an 80s-obsessed teenager, with frilly ruffled dresses as far as the eye can see, costing between $100 and $400, sequined miniskirts for $38, little silver necklaces with the words \"Old School\" as a nameplate. Best of all are the kitsch touches, such as a statue of a dog in one corner, each of its paws shoved into yellow heels. </p> <p>It is a niche out of which Field was pushed only when she was hired as the stylist on Sex And The City - and it was as a stylist that her talents really came to the fore. Such was the strength of the clothes in SATC that they became one of the focuses of the show, as important as the women's relationships with each other and with men - and despite the fact that, in the newspaper columns by Candace Bushnell on which the show was based, they find barely a mention. </p> <p>Field's skill at mixing couture with kitsch, treating fashion in a way that was fun as opposed to reverential, made designer clothes look cool instead of stuffy. Names such as Chlo\u00e9, Gucci and Manolo Blahnik suddenly became as familiar to a new generation as the names of celebrities. Field's ability to evoke the characters through their wardrobes - preppy Charlotte in Moschino tea dresses, offbeat Carrie in vintage prom frocks - showed an individuality rarely found in style magazines, homogenised by their reliance on industry advertising, and made Field an international fashion icon, described by one newspaper as having \"more power than Vogue\".</p> <p>The parodic extravagance of the clothes on Sex And The City - peaking in the final episode when Carrie wears an Oscar de la Renta ballgown (starting price $75,000) for a date - has meant Field is often associated with expensive designer fashion. She has even been blamed for the ridiculous prices of high-fashion handbags and shoes, due to their prominence in the show and the desire they provoked. Yet her real aim is to make fashion available to everyone, whatever their bank balance or gender, which explains previous collaborations with brands such as Candie's, a cheap US shoe line, and Barbie. </p> <p>She is canny, business-minded and at times brusque. After she mentions that she worked on the early series of SATC with her now ex-girlfriend, I ask why she thinks there are so many gay men working in womenswear but relatively few gay women. She replies sharply, \"I know plenty of gay women in fashion. Maybe you just don't think they're gay because they're fashionable.\" As for when she realised how influential her styles on the show were becoming, \"On October 5 1995\" comes the biting reply.</p> <p>She is, however, pleasingly unprecious. When asked if she felt she needed to temper her natural style for M&amp;S, she says, \"I come from retail and I have saleability in my blood. The only way [the collection] will sell is if a lot of people can wear it, afford it and enjoy it. So, yes, I tempered it for the M&amp;S customer, just as I tempered it for the wider population. But it still has my essence.\"</p> <p>She has a similar shrugged-shoulders attitude to styling, saying simply, \"It's easy, it pays well and you don't have to worry about inventory [as you do when running a store]. For me, it was like a windfall, because in retail you have to work very long hours and often don't make much money. But [with styling] they're paying you all this money to put clothes on a few people. I was like, wow!\"</p> <p>This clear-sightedness has no doubt helped Field stay slightly outside the fashion world. Notably, she also did the styling for two of the best-known parodies of that world, The Devil Wears Prada and Ugly Betty, an experience she describes as \"fantastic\".</p> <p>Despite having been heavily courted during the making of SATC, with designers desperate for Field to feature their wares, she has stayed loyal to her downtown clientele. At her show later that night, instead of the usual rent-a-celeb front row, there are wildly made-up transvestites who bow to her when she takes to the catwalk. Field, still in her sparkly minidress, dances down the runway, eyes shut in bliss, surrounded by clapping models and clubbers, and looking very much as if, at the end of a long day, she has found her place.</p> <p>The Patricia Field at Marks &amp; Spencer Destination Style New York range is available from October 16, 0845 302 1234 (<a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/patriciafield\">marksandspencer.com/patriciafield</a>)</p>",

  "<p>We are also perplexed by the allegation that the Malaysian government is a repressive regime (In praise of... Raja Petra Raja Kamarudin, September 24). Does this mean that countries like the UK, Singapore, Brunei, and the US that have similar safeguards and preventive laws like Malaysia's internal security act are also repressive regimes? For Malaysia, maintaining public order and the interest of the majority is of paramount importance. The ISA is a preventive law consonant with the constitution, to provide for the national interest and internal security of the country. It is not designed to curtail freedom of expression, but to protect the public's right to live in comfort without fearing for their lives. Malaysia strongly believes that the exercise of freedom of expression comes with a responsibility, especially in a multicultural and multireligious society like Malaysia. </p> <p>As for the detention of Raja Petra under, it is in accordance with Malaysian law. He was detained under the ISA after he refused to heed the advice of the police not to continue with his insulting and degrading articles on Islam. Police found articles posted by him on his web portal that would incite racial and religious tension and disrupt peace in the country. Malaysia does not tolerate racially provocative remarks as they would cause tension and conflict and disrupt the balance among its racially diverse community. Malaysia practices democracy without fear or favour.

  "<p>Four men were convicted yesterday of being part of a robbery gang that stole \u00a3500,000 in an 18-month crime spree targeting security vans. It ended when the mastermind and an accomplice were shot dead by police. </p> <p>Terence Wallace, Adrian Johnson, Leroy Wilkinson and Victor Iniodu, all from south London, are facing lengthy jail terms for their involvement in the gang, which carried out raids in Oxford, Swindon, Bristol, Bath, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Reading, Ipswich and Gloucestershire between April 2006 and September last year. </p> <p>Their run of successful raids ended abruptly when flying squad officers worked out where the gang would strike next and lay in wait.</p> <p>When Mark Nunes, the ringleader, held a pistol to the head of a security guard near the HSBC in the village of Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, his \"luck ran out\", the trial heard, and he was shot dead by a police marksman. Fellow robber Andrew Markland suffered the same fate when he tried to pick up the weapon and a second officer shot him twice.</p> <p>Yesterday the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said there was no evidence the marksmen had committed any criminal offences or misconduct, but investigators had found \"issues\" around the implementation of the operation. </p> <p>Getaway driver Wallace, 26, Johnson, 28, Wilkinson, 29, and Iniodu, 34, were found guilty of conspiracy to rob after a jury at Kingston crown court deliberated for more than 15 hours. They had denied the charges. The court heard that a series of reconnaissance trips were carried out before each raid, to choose locations next to alleyways for fast getaways and to pinpoint areas where vehicles could be switched. Often two or three stolen cars with false number plates were used and one would be dumped 100 yards down the road to throw police off the scent. </p> <p>They targeted Group 4 Security vans as guards were transferring money to high street outlets, selecting only vehicles on low-security routes because they knew they were not equipped with cash boxes that belch out coloured smoke or dye. </p> <p>Guns were used in some of the raids and guards were punched, kicked and knocked to the ground. In May 2006 the gang escaped with \u00a3165,000, their biggest single sum, after pistol-whipping a guard outside a Lloyds TSB in Bristol. </p> <p>Detectives used cell-site analysis - where a position is traced to a mobile phone - to place conspirators at the scenes in the weeks before the robberies. By last summer they had Nunes, who had previously served eight and a half years for armed robbery, and his accomplices under surveillance and were waiting for them in Chandlers Ford, near Southampton, on the morning of September 13.</p> <p>Surveillance footage seen by the jury showed the security van pulling up next to the bank and a guard getting out. As Nunes, 35, runs towards him a police officer says: \"Robbery, robbery, strike, strike, strike. He has a gun to his head.\" A shot is heard as Nunes slumps to the floor. Markland, 36, then runs into view and attempts to pick up the weapon dropped by Nunes. He too is shot and falls to the ground. </p> <p>Detective Inspector Terry Wilson, of the Metropolitan police's flying squad, said the deaths of the two men remained \"deeply regrettable\". Inquests into their deaths are to open shortly. Johnson was also convicted of a separate robbery last November, but was acquitted of possessing a gas canister. Sentencing on all the men will take place at a later date.</p>",
  "<h2>Are all football managers really like Kinnear?</h2> <p>Football seemed to hit yet another new nadir on Thursday when Joe Kinnear, Newcastle United's manager, swore at reporters 52 times during the opening five minutes of a press conference. </p> <p>The Guardian's decision to publish a transcript provokes an intriguing debate as to whether the national game's slick marketing men are merely camouflaging its brutish, old school realities.</p> <p>Yet while the sport is frequently far less politically correct than the sanitised images portrayed by television interviews, Kinnear's tirade was exceptional. Indeed, the 61-year-old, who had been unemployed for four years before recently becoming Kevin Keegan's interim successor, merely confirmed suspicions that he is yesterday's man. </p> <p>Which is not to say that his behaviour was ever commonplace. Today's managers largely operate a double standard whereby they treat their players to volleys of \"industrial\" language behind closed doors while appearing impeccably mannered in public. Personal attacks on individual journalists did, and do, take place. But they have always tended to be private bollockings.</p> <p>With their job security inherently fragile, managers know they can do without making unnecessary enemies and appreciate that compliant writers can prove extremely useful when it comes to communicating their side of things to supporters and chairmen. Kinnear's north-east neighbours, Sunderland's Roy Keane and Middlesbrough's Gareth Southgate, are particularly skilled, expletive-free operators.</p> <p>While it would be wrong to say that modern football bosses never swear at reporters, most are, publicly at least, minding their language more than ever before. Self-preservation plays a big part. They know that any off-colour remark is likely to be picked up by omnipresent microphones and relayed, almost instantly, to the wider world.<br><strong>Louise Taylor </strong></p> <h2>How can piracy be stopped?</h2> <p>Once after hoards of gold and silver in the Caribbean, pirates are now claiming millions of dollars in ransom money as they take advantage of failed and weak states - in particular Somalia and Yemen around the Gulf of Aden.</p> <p>Somali pirates yesterday were still holding a Ukrainian ship with tanks and heavy weapons bound for Kenya or Sudan on board. They have said they had no idea what the cargo was and are not linked to any insurgent or terrorist group. They were just in it for the money - a $20m (\u00a311m) ransom.</p> <p>True or not, there is little doubt that piracy is fuelling a conflict between a weak Somali government and Islamic insurgents. About 26 ships have been hijacked in the region so far this year. This week Chatham House, the London-based foreign policy thinktank, said piracy could trigger a humanitarian and environmental disaster in the Horn of Africa and cut off the Suez canal. Now, a number of EU countries have offered to form a new naval force to protect the shipping lanes off Somalia.</p> <p>Combating piracy is an ideal mission for an international force, one that could enable the EU to project its \"soft power\" as well as one which the Russians could join. Indeed, every state would have an interest in countering an activity hostile to international law and protecting the freedom of the seas and important trade routes.</p> <p>But as Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated, it all depends on what weapons you use. Tanks and bombers have not beaten the insurgents in either country. An effective naval force must be able to stop modern pirates who generally operate in fast but small boats. A counter force would have to include flexible craft able to respond rapidly. </p> <p>But in the end, good governance and economic stability in countries such as Somalia would provide a more lasting solution.<br><strong>Richard Norton-Taylor</strong></p> <h2>Why is the US embassy moving?</h2> <p>The Americans are abandoning Mayfair, London, and retreating south of the river for one simple reason - security.</p> <p>The US state department spent $15m (\u00a38.5m) last year trying to upgrade security at the Grosvenor Square embassy, erecting high fences and concrete barriers and generally offending the aesthetic sensibilities of the neighbours. But the building remained a relatively easy target for a determined truck-bomber. </p> <p>It was opened in 1960, at the start of the Kennedy era, and its wide glass expanses reflect a more innocent age. Now they are a security nightmare. Efforts to have all the surrounding roads closed failed due to opposition from the local council. Some local residents, fearing they were living next door to one of the world's most enticing terrorist targets, sold up and moved out.</p> <p>The new embassy will be on a more spacious site at Wandsworth's Nine Elms \"opportunity area\" between Battersea power station and the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. Not quite as glamorous an address as Mayfair, where John Adams, America's first envoy to Britain and its second president, set up house in 1785. But as the current ambassador, Robert Tuttle pointed out, the new site will actually be closer to the heart of British government, with views of parliament.</p> <p>Most importantly, moving to Nine Elms will provide room for the high walls and layers of security that have turned US embassies around the world into imposing fortresses over the past 10 years.</p> <p>The fortifications began immediately after the 1998 al-Qaida attacks on the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Since then, over 60 new embassies and other diplomatic outposts have been built to new specifications. According to reports from Washington, it would cost $600 million to upgrade the existing embassy and its defences would still be second-best to a new building. </p> <p>But the American diplomats may yet have to make do with second best. They have to wait for congressional approval, which is likely, and for planning approval, which is uncertain as always.<br><strong>Julian Borger</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Jon Henley</h2> <p>I don't know where she is now, Lorna Sanders, or what she's doing, but it's fair to say that without her, this whole relationship would never have got off the ground. \"You were,\" says my mum, whose memories of the occasion are somewhat sharper than my own, \"three days old. Lorna was a member of the Pinner Occasional Players, of which your father was at that time one of the leading lights. She was your first visitor. He was your first gift.\"</p> <p>I can't imagine I took much notice of Blue Ted when he first arrived. I take my mother's word for it that he was an unusually handsome bear, beady-eyed, solidly stuffed, and - as the name might imply - bright blue. But as a host of other rivals for my affections gradually appeared on the scene, I religiously spurned them all, until by the time I was walking, Blue Ted and I were, indisputably, an item. </p> <p>There exists an embarrassing series of black-and-white photographs of me gambolling in a park in about 1962, Blue Ted clamped firmly under one arm as if no force on earth could ever pry him loose. \"You were absolutely inseparable,\" says Mum. \"You carried him everywhere. Along with an empty jar of Marmite. You loved that, too. You wouldn't go anywhere without them.\"</p> <p>We've had our ups and downs since those heady early days, Blue Ted and I, as is the nature of all relationships. Our moments of complicity, and of seeming indifference. For some time, I'm told, a small plastic tortoise supplanted him in my heart and hot little hand, followed by a succession of Dinky and Corgi toys (including that gold Aston Martin DB5 with the pop-out machine guns, spring-up bullet-proof rear window shield and ejector seat).</p> <p>But Blue Ted must have been special. You only have to look at him now - limp, threadbare, battered, darned, the stuffing literally knocked right out of him, to see how much he must have been hugged. The spark went out of our physical relations, I would imagine, some time in the mid-60s, but Blue Ted continued to sit somewhere in my bedroom throughout my childhood and adolescence, a largely forgotten but still comforting presence amid the hormonal turmoil. An emblem of innocence, perhaps, as I set resolutely about the business of losing mine. </p> <p>We grew ever more distant with adulthood. Still, Blue Ted came with me - albeit, as far as I can remember, in a shoebox - to university. He accompanied me on a 20-year European tour that took in Amsterdam, Helsinki and Paris. Intriguingly, around the time I had children of my own, he seems to have emerged from his hibernation. In fact he's lying in a corner of the bedroom now, though not so as anyone would ever notice him. </p> <p>I haven't a clue what all this says about me, of course; this must be the first time I've consciously devoted more than about two seconds' thought to the scraggy old bugger in about 45 years. But Blue Ted is the only object from my earliest childhood that I still possess. He's still there, and that is, undeniably, a thought that kind of pleases me. So, um, thanks, Lorna. </p> <h2>William Leith</h2> <p>When I was asked if I had a childhood teddy bear, I began to feel distinctly odd. Well, yes, I did have a teddy bear. And this bear was in a cupboard in my house. On a shelf, actually, behind some bags of stuff that I want to sort through, but never do. I knew where the bear was. I had not thrown the bear away. But it was definitely out of sight, and when somebody asked me about the bear, I felt very slightly queasy.</p> <p>What was the bear called? I also felt strange thinking about this. The bear was - or, rather, had been - called Ted. For a while, after my little brother got a smaller bear, my bear was Big Ted, and my brother's was Little Ted. At primary school, my brother was asked to write a story about his teddy bear. This story, it turned out, was some of the most potent ammunition I ever had in my armoury. Just mentioning it - or, in the end, anything to do with it - would draw unimaginable amounts of shame and embarrassment. </p> <p>\"Hey, what was that you wrote about your teddy bear?\"</p> <p>And: \"Don't worry, mate - there's nothing weird or strange about a guy who writes about his teddy bear.\"</p> <p>And: \"If you feel that strongly about it.\"</p> <p>And: \"No, I'm just saying.\"</p> <p>And: \"Ow!\"</p> <p>And: \"Mum, he's out of control!\"</p> <p>And now it's my turn, I suppose. It's all because of Sebastian Flyte and his bear in Brideshead Revisited. Now, I do have a theory about this. But first: taking your teddy bear to university? Dear me. I wouldn't have even taken mine to school. I slept in a dormitory with loads of other boys and a bear would have signalled vulnerability. A bear would have been a sign saying \"hit me\". Anyway, Flyte's bear was Evelyn Waugh's symbolism at work. Flyte would not let go of his bear because he did not want to let go of his childhood; he was the aristocracy on its last legs, not wanting the future to happen.</p> <p>So: my bear. It was given to my mother, by the members of a class she was teaching, when she went on maternity leave. It's a nice story. I've heard it told many times. It's the sort of story that gets told again and again - the sort of heart-warming story that, somehow, becomes hard to listen to. I heard it again, quite recently, after I had had my son. The bear resurfaced. My mother suggested that I give it to my son. I felt conflicted. Why? I'm sure a psychiatrist could unravel the whole thing - the fact that I hate, and yet am drawn to, sentimentality, my relationships with the bear, the dormitory, my empty bedroom with the bear in it, and so on.</p> <p>So I gave the bear to my son. I said, \"Do you want it?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" he said. \"I want the other bears.\"</p> <p>\"Right,\" I said, relieved. That's when I put the bear in the cupboard.</p> <h2>Andrew Martin </h2> <p>I can't remember when or where I came by The Panda. I've just always had him. I never went so far as to name him, but a strong bond was formed between us when he survived a terrible attack.</p> <p>When I was a boy, it was the task of whoever made my bed (which was certainly not me) to prop The Panda on top of the pillows. One day, when I was nine, a friend of mine - a rather rough friend - came up into my bedroom. The first thing he did was to pick my goldfish out of its bowl, saying he wanted to \"stroke\" him. Lobbing the fish back into the water, he then turned his attentions towards my bed, and a moment later he was holding The Panda in one hand and a purple marker pen, snatched from my desk, in the other. As I hurled myself at him, he scrawled a drawing of a stick man on The Panda's chest, which was at that time coloured white. </p> <p>It was class war. I was being punished for a) having a panda and b) having a desk, with pens neatly arrayed. I was angry rather than upset at this, but when I saw that my mother was upset, I became likewise. It was impossible to clean off the drawing; I would have to banish The Panda, otherwise I would be reminded of his assailant every time I looked at him. But then my mother set about sowing a black patch over The Panda's white chest. The sheer brilliance of this solution left me stunned: the only requirement of a panda was that it be black and white; it didn't matter which bits were black or white.</p> <p>I also had a golliwog (but we won't talk about him), and a long-snouted Clanger that was made of an old brown sock, as indeed, as far as I could see, were the ones in the animated television series that popularised these creatures. This pair fell by the wayside during my itinerant 20s, but I've always found house room for The Panda in memory of my mother, who died about a year after performing that rescue operation.</p> <p>The Panda is accommodated in my youngest son's bedroom, where for years he's been kept out of the fray, sitting on top of a bookshelf. My son, a dutiful host but not emotionally involved, recently reported that The Panda's black patch is beginning to come off, and I'm still furious when I peek at the stick man lurking underneath. I will not let the patch fall off entirely and, since it sends all the wrong signals for a man to ask his wife to repair his teddy bear, I suppose I will have to sew it back on myself.</p> <p>\u2022 How To Get Things Really Flat: A Man's Guide to Ironing, Dusting and Other Household Arts by Andrew Martin is published this week by Short Books, priced \u00a312.99</p> <h2>Guy Browning</h2> <p>We call them cuddlies in our house. I believe the proper word for them is familiars but to my mind that doesn't really communicate our intense feelings for them. We have five cuddlies in our household. My wife has a panda called Nosewhiskers, a name that may sound cute when you're a child but begins to sound quite unpleasant when you're a middle-aged man. My eldest daughter has a sleepy rabbit called Snoozly, my eldest son a dog called Dougie and my youngest son a rabbit with unusually erect ears called Real Rabbit. It's called that because one night, when we'd searched for him for about 17 hours, we tried to palm our son off with another similar rabbit with floppy ears. He knew immediately that this was an imposter, and when we eventually found the genuine article (stuffed in the back of a lorry like an illegal immigrant rabbit) he became Real Rabbit so we wouldn't be confused in future. </p> <p>My cuddly is a donkey called Burro. He's from El Salvador, which is where I was when I was a baby and in need of something cuddly to alleviate possible home sickness. Sadly, cuddly toys didn't exist in El Salvador in those days, and the closest thing to it was Burro, a rather touristy donkey sold in airports to desperate business travellers wanting last-minute gifts for home. Without wishing to be in any way disloyal, Burro is not cuddly. As he is made out of some kind of industrial-strength sacking material, I would have to say that he is actually quite rough. </p> <p>In his defence, Burro is a donkey and is therefore a hardworking beast of burden. Although he wasn't terribly good in the cuddling department, he did have saddlebags on either side of his sturdy little body. In these bags you could stow things of vital importance to a young boy, principally pieces of biscuit and the key to my secret treasure chest. In the treasure chest were things of absolutely vitally vital importance, such as Opal Fruits. </p> <p>A brilliant design feature on Burro is that you could adjust the whites of his eyes. If you rotate them to the top of his eyes he looks rather happy, as if you'd just relieved him of a great burden. My favourite position is one eye up and one eye down, which makes little Burro look like the Mad Donkey of the Pampas. </p> <p>The other good thing about Burro is that he stood on his own four legs. This means he is rubbish in bed because he won't lie down, but it does mean he can tirelessly stand guard on my bedside table. One of the reasons I still have Burro is because he isn't very cuddly, so, like a prickly old aunt, he suffered very little in the way of emotional wear and tear. He still stands guard with his mad eyes and I find that comfortingly familiar. </p> <h2>Oliver James</h2> <p>Whether I chose Koaly, my koala, I do not know. I suspect that he (for it is a he, I feel sure, absence of genitalia notwithstanding) was a present from a relative at a loss for something better to give. </p> <p>I think his principal role for me was as a mummy substitute. I can distinctly recall clinging on to him and feeling safer as a result. This is interesting in theoretical and personal terms.</p> <p>Both my parents were psychoanalysts who were quite close friends with Donald Winnicott, the creator of the concept of the transitional object. By this he meant the infant or toddler's \"first possession\", an object that could be experienced at times as being part of me; at others, not part of me. He maintained that it was able to occupy the space between me and not-me where play occurs, where we are neither trying to impose ourselves on our environment, nor being dictated by it. Play is not goal-directed or purposeful, not about trying to fulfil an instinct, as in sexual intercourse (versus flirting). Rather, like much of art or sport or fun, it is done for its own sake. </p> <p>Winnicott argued that infants do not start life with very clear boundaries between inner and outer. They use transitional objects to play with this distinction, so that if you observe infants with their object they will sometimes treat it as a separate entity to be bossed about or stroked, and sometimes cling to it, as part of themselves.</p> <p>One of Winnicott's key points was that the transitional object is not a mummy substitute or what his contemporary, John Bowlby, would have called an attachment figure. That is why I find it interesting to reflect that my Koaly was both a transitional object and could stand in for my mum. While I definitely played with him (probably incredibly violent games in which he destroyed other soft toys), he was also my safe haven when the ghouls and wolves gathered after the lights went out.</p> <p>As the third of four children under five, I definitely needed something. My mum was run off her feet, having had a pretty tricky childhood herself. Now a parent myself, I can see all too clearly how helpful soft toys are for keeping wolves at the door as well as for helping us to enter imaginary worlds. </p> <p>\u2022 See <a href=\"http://www.selfishcapitalist.com\">selfishcapitalist.com</a> for Oliver James's writings and broadcasting</p> <h2>Will Self</h2> <p>My children ask me about the toys I had when I was a child all the time - the subject fascinates them. They never tire of hearing about the Secret Sam briefcase, complete with automatic pistol, and the Moon Probe (I was eight in 1969 and moon toys were in vogue). But these hi-tech toys, while lusted after, were never much played with. </p> <p>What I tend to be a little quieter about - at least with the boys - is the extent to which I adored cuddly toys. I had bears I hung on to until they rotted and the amount of imaginative effort I put into giving them interior lives far surpasses anything I've ever done with the characters in my books. </p> <p>There were glove puppets that wouldn't leave my hand for weeks at a time, as they developed sinister sub-personalities of their own. </p> <p>I do 'fess up to the cuddly toys with my daughter - since she's had the same passion. Together we've visited \"bear factories\", and acquired bears you can put in the microwave and ones that have artificial voice boxes on which you can record your own voice (her bear speaks in my angry tones, saying, \"Buck up, Maddie!\"); but while I've brought her bears back from as far afield as Los Angeles and Lima, the sad fact is that she - unlike me - has outgrown them. There they sit, abandoned in her bedroom, and if it wasn't for me going in from time to time to give them a cuddle, I think they might pine away altogether.</p> <p>\u2022 Liver, by Will Self, is published by Viking at \u00a318.99</p> <p>\u2022 Brideshead Revisited (12A) is now on general release</p>",
  "<h2>Follow the Big Mac Index</h2> <p>For most of us macro-economics are about as intelligible as Swahili. But Big Macs? Possibly. The Economist's yearly <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=\" 11793125\" \">Big Mac Index</a> compares the price of the ubiquitous burger around the world. This year's list sees a number of beach destinations showing encouraging signs of monetary weakness, which a quick cross-check on flights and hotels prices will corroborate. Take the <strong>Philippines</strong>, with a \"currency valuation\" of -45 (Norway is +121), for example: flights over the winter can be had for just over \u00a3500 with Qatar or Kuwait Airways, and great beach hotels near Manila, such as the <strong>Coco Beach Island Resort</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.cocobeach.com\">cocobeach.com</a>), can be bagged for less that \u00a340 per night for a double. </p> <h2>South America's budget flipside</h2> <p>Flights to South America have been going through the roof, so think about avoiding expensive Brazil and its overvalued currency and heading for <strong>Ecuador</strong> and the beaches of northern <strong>Peru</strong> - a perfect budget alternative to the Rio to Buenos Aires Atlantic route. In Ecuador, the coastal village of <strong>Montanita</strong>, long a favourite with Ecuadorian surfers, has become something of a nouveau backpacker haven over the last few years, with beachfront cabanas starting from $6 per night (<a href=\"http://www.pakaloro.com\">pakaloro.com</a>). In Peru, the popular Loki hostel group (<a href=\"http://www.lokihostel.com\">lokihostel.com</a>) is about to open its first seaside venture in <strong>Mancora</strong>, another surfing mecca, with doubles from \u00a335 per night. </p> <p>\u2022 STA Travel (<a href=\"http://www.statravel.co.uk\">statravel.co.uk</a>) have London-Lima return fares from \u00a3589 return over the winter months.</p> <h2>Go the Mid-haul</h2> <p>According to Thomson and First Choice's new Trends Report, this year's travel phenomenon is to be found somewhere in the middle distance. It's hardly Nostradamian prophecy, really, more simple maths. Long-haul involves big air fares (especially flights exceeding nine hours, which are burdened with fuel surcharges of up to 30% more than those below) and short-haul often involves the Euro, which has been whopping the pound's proverbial for a while now. </p> <p>The survey pointed towards the <strong>Middle East</strong> and <strong>North Africa</strong> as classic mid-haul routes, but the <strong>Cape Verde</strong> islands are another destination whose budget status derives from its in-betweenness. <a href=\"http://www.Holidayoptions.co.uk\">Holidayoptions.co.uk</a> has a great selection of properties across the islands around the \u00a3600 all-in mark, and with new flights operating from Gatwick this winter opening up a direct route to the island of Boa Vista, the beachfront bungalows of the <strong>Hotel Parque das Dunas</strong> are now less than six hours away.</p> <h2>Look for the competition</h2> <p>If there's one economic rule we understand, it's that competition drives prices down. This applies to flights, and since the Indian government relaxed restrictions on the number of UK flights a few years ago, fares to India have dropped considerably. Virgin and BA regularly try to out-cheap each other on the <strong>London-Mumbai</strong> route, so fares can be well under \u00a3400 return over the winter. Once there, head to some of the deserted beaches south of the city, such as Alibaug, Murud or Kashid. The latter is particularly undeveloped, spanning three kilometres of sand buffering a tiny village from the Arabian Sea, and during the week, you can have most of it to yourself. </p> <p>\u2022 Visitors can find cheap bungalow accommodation upon arrival for as little as \u00a310pn, but if you want to book ahead, nivalink.com has a list of options.</p>",
  "<h2>I can't afford the mortgage. How many payments can I miss before I lose my home?</h2> <p>Mortgage lenders are nothing if not jumpy right now, and some subprime operators are taking action to hassle borrowers to get back on track \"almost immediately after the first month's missed payment\" a Citizens Advice Bureau spokeswoman says. High street lenders, preferring that you keep up some sort of repayment, are fortunately taking a lot longer. </p> <p>Much depends on your relationship with the mortgage company, a spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders says. \"For a few months, you could arrange to take a payment holiday - especially if you have equity in the property; extend the loan to make payments cheaper or switch to interest-only.\" You won't lose your house without first going to court, though. And take heart from these figures: only 0.16% of home loans are more than 12 months in arrears, up by 3,900 over the past 18 months. </p> <h2>I've absolutely no money left to pay the water bill that's just landed. Will I be cut off if I don't pay? </h2> <p>Absolutely not, because it's illegal. Water regulator Ofwat ruled it out for residential homes in England and Wales nearly a decade ago as part of the Water Industry Act 1999, and a different - but equally protective law - covers you in Scotland. Different rules apply for commercial premises. </p> <p>Tell your supplier immediately you have a problem, and choose to pay your bill in weekly or fortnightly chunks instead. But ignore payment, and your provider can use bailiffs or take you to court.</p> <h2>Can my gas and electricity be cut off if I don't pay my bills? </h2> <p>Technically, yes, and power suppliers don't need to go to court to do so. However, much depends on your attitude. In theory, disconnection can take place 28 days after a final bill demand including a hand-delivered notice of intent to cut you off, says a spokesman for Consumer Focus, the newly merged consumer watchdog. But as a rule it will only happen if you've also refused to allow a prepayment meter to be installed or defaulted on an agreed payment arrangement. And if you're on a \"social tariff\", the provider will follow more lenient rules too. </p> <p>\"Don't worry, it's an absolute last resort, and companies come to a 'pay back' plan with nearly all customers,\" says a spokeswoman for the National Debtline charity. \"They'd much rather have you paying off small amounts than no money at all.\"</p> <h2>Will I go to jail if I don't pay my council tax bill? </h2> <p>You could end up behind bars, but, in the process, you'd have scooped an award for being an uncooperative and pigheaded taxpayer. If you anticipate a struggle to pay, your council will usually find a way to help you - setting up a different timetable for payments, offering a discount for a \"second adult rebate\" or seeing if you qualify for council tax benefit. Simply call and request to pay less for a temporary period, a CAB spokeswoman says. Only if a council has tried every other method - including bailiffs and a charging order on your home - to get its money will it resort to jail.</p> <h2>I'm heavily overdrawn and pick up penalty fines regularly. Can my bank ditch me as a customer and make me repay all my debts? </h2> <p>Undoubtedly. Banks are free to pick and choose their customers, a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association warns, and if it's had enough of you, you'll be forced to look elsewhere. \"You've got 30 days, under normal circumstances, to find somewhere else. A bank decides its own customer base make-up.\" </p> <p>That's not to say it'll be a swift sayonara: keep your bank in the loop with everything you're struggling with, and it'll do its best to work with you. \"Banks hate surprises,\" the spokesman adds. \"So keep it up to date and you should be able to hammer out a deal.\"</p> <h2>How soon will the firm take my credit card off me after missing a payment? </h2> <p>There's no straightforward protocol here. It's most likely down to your existing card history, says Sandra Quinn at payments body Apacs. \"If you're an average customer who misses one payment, you'll just get a fine; miss two months on the trot and the lender will be in touch straightaway to help out.\" </p> <p>However, if you have a track record of irresponsible spending, you face a much quicker exit. Barclaycard, the UK's biggest credit card provider, says it would first try to \"rehabilitate\" customers - \"perhaps a payment holiday, or to [temporarily] suspend interest\" before closing down your account. </p> <p><strong>We can save \u00a3800 by ditching our home buildings and contents insurance. Should we risk it? </strong></p> <p>Are you mad? Any incident - a fire, storm damage, freak flooding - could wipe out what is probably your most valuable asset. </p> <p>As with car insurance, which is compulsory, home cover is never worth cutting a corner for, according to the consumer group Which? Essential Guide for Consumers. Bin your mobile cover or ID fraud cover instead.</p> <p>\"Cutting out home insurance premiums in order to save money is hugely risky and could result in financial ruin if your home is damaged or destroyed through fire, flood or subsidence,\" a More Than spokeswoman warns. </p> <h2>We're tempted to pawn jewellery to make ends meet. Should we do it? </h2> <p>Pawnbrokers have a terrible reputation, and it's no surprise with annual interest at between 50% and 100%. They're a last resort for anyone who needs ready cash in a flash but can't get finance at their bank. Try a credit union first (<a href=\"http://www.abcul.org\">abcul.org</a>) where more flexible new rules allow easier credit. As a rule of thumb, expect only half the value of your goods and expect to pay at least 8% interest a month with a minimum six-month contract.</p> <h2>The TV licence is up for renewal, could we get away with not paying? </h2> <p>You could follow Noel Edmonds in his recent threat to withhold payment in protest at what he called heavy-handed TV adverts for non-payment, but be under no illusion: the \u00a3139.50 for a colour licence (or \u00a347 for black and white) will be infinitely more affordable than the maximum \u00a31,000 fine for avoidance.</p> <p>If you're over 75, or live with someone who is, place the TV licence in their name and it's free. Short of a handy septuagenarian, though, you could offer to pay weekly in a cash plan charging you \u00a35.50 per instalment, and you'll be clear after six months.</p> <p>Pay monthly by direct debit to ease the burden, but don't offer to pay quarterly by direct debit: there's a \u00a31.25 premium each quarter to do so.</p>",
  "<p>The thing about Dr Stephen Briers, a child psychologist, is that he really wants us to become child psychologists too. \"It's not a mystical art,\" he says. \"A lot of people could have a stab at it.\" Moreover, it's important we have a go, he says, and not just because the statistics are so alarming - 10% of children under the age of 16 have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Rather, psychology is the key to good parenting. That is why he's written Superpowers for Parents: The Psychology of Great Parenting and Happy Children, a handy guide to therapy techniques. If you understand your children and, most importantly, if your children understand themselves, they will grow up to be happy, well-adjusted adults, says Briers. \"We've got very obsessed with the idea that the hallmark of excellent parenting is to have immaculately behaved children,\" he says. \"We've forgotten that one of the points of being a parent is to try and equip your children for life and give them the skills they need.\" </p> <p>Aimed at parents with children of any age, his book tells you how to become an \"emotional coach\" and not let sentences such as \"Because I say so, that's why,\" fall from your lips. It advises you to draw stick figures with thought bubbles to show the connection between thought and feelings and tells you what to do if your child has a 3am freak out about their piano exam. (Probe their anxiety about failure with questions such as \"What would be the worst thing about that?\") But best of all it doesn't mention the naughty step. Or not much. Because if you use Briers' techniques, the need for the naughty step won't arise in the first place. </p> <p>Briers, 43, lives in Brighton with his wife, Melanie, a former midwife and now school nurse, and his two sons, aged 12 and eight. An English and theology graduate from Cambridge University, Briers came to mental health via a PhD in the sociology of religion. He now works for a private practice in Brighton doing a mixture of clinical work with children and adults and \"dabbles\" in the media. \"I want to shift the parenting agenda away from control,\" he says, firing a broadside against Gina Ford, the author of childcare books based on strict routine. \"We are very influenced by the behaviourist tradition,\" he explains. This is the theory that goes back to the 1930s and John Watson, the American baby expert who believed that parents should break the spirit of their infants in the same way trainers tame a horse. Claire Verity's series Bringing Up Baby for Channel 4, with her ration of 10 minutes of cuddling per day, followed the same model. \"The idea is that by reinforcing behaviours you want and producing an aversive condition in response to behaviour you don't want (the naughty step), you shape what happens.\" Behaviourism has a place, he says, \"but I think there's a lot more to children than that, and more to parenting, too\". </p> <p>Briers' priority is \"emotional intelligence\": \"Children who are emotionally literate, who demonstrate a high capacity for empathy and have social problem-solving skills, tend to be protected from all manner of mental health problems,\" he says. Moreover, he believes that emotional intelligence isn't only the key to future happiness, it's as important as intellectual attainment. So a parent's job isn't just to teach children how to say \"please\" and \"thank you\", and to know their multiplication tables, they must also expand their child's emotional vocabulary. \"Read to your child and discuss how characters might be feeling,\" says Briers. \"Do you think he's feeling scared/cross/happy/upset?\" He also recommends that parents teach their children about famously altruistic people such as Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King and ensure they become proficient at interpreting body language. It's all fascinating, not least because it all goes against our buttoned-up national psyche. But isn't it all a bit wet? \"It is very un-British,\" Briers admits. \"The danger is that because of that stereotype, people see the opposite as being rather touchy-feely, liberal wishy-washy,\" he says. \"The irony is that if you have an emotionally literate, skilled child they are much less likely to get beaten up in the playground and have problems. </p> <p>\"To be a kind person doesn't mean you have to be a pushover and if we think about what we actually value in people we love, it's not normally their incomes or their IQs.\"</p> <p>The purpose of getting your child to be more in touch with their emotions (and those of others) is to help them manage them. Briers takes the view (as do those who subscribe to this cognitive behavioural approach) that there is a connection between thoughts, feelings and behaviour. \"Scratch below the surface of a badly behaved child's defiance and we probably find ... a soul in some degree of torment,\" he writes. \"Behaviour will at some level be a communication,\" he explains, \"it has meaning, it has context.\" A parent's job is to show the child how to join the dots. \"How you interpret a situation is going to determine how you feel about it and what you do about it,\" he explains. </p> <p>Shakespeare subscribed to something similar: \"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\" (Hamlet, act II, scene II). And pointing out unhelpful ways of thinking -\"think traps\", says Briers - is something you can teach children from a young age. For instance, next time your child gets something wrong in class and comes home saying, \"I've made a complete fool of myself. I won't ever be able to show my face in there again ...\" you'll be able to point out that she is \"catastrophising\" - assuming the worst and seeing the consequences as more terrible than they need be. </p> <p>But helping your child to maintain healthy mental habits is a rather long-winded process, not least because it involves asking so many questions, such as \"Why do you think ...?\" and \"How did that make you/him feel?\" Do we have time for this? \"This is about developing a different kind of relationship with your child that is integrated into your daily interactions,\" says Briers. \"If we don't invest the time and energy we have only ourselves to blame if we produce a generation of children who are struggling and prone to problems.\" </p> <p>In fact, he says, if there's one thing we can all do to make a difference, it's to listen. \"Spending time really listening to children helps develop their capacity for empathy, makes them feel contained and supported and puts them in a good place.\" In the book, Briers even gives tips on how to be a good listener: \"Maintain a good level of eye contact - usually a third of the time, as a rough guide.\" </p> <p>Showing attentiveness bordering on suffocation isn't the answer. Neither is \"blanket praise\", telling your children you love every painting they have ever done. \"Praise can easily become devalued if children just feel you are paying lip-service,\" Briers warns. Be specific: \"I love the way you made that girl look as though she's running.\"</p> <p>Clearly, it's all a fine balancing act. Not least in the way you approach meaningful conversations in the first place. Leaning forward and saying, \"So, tell me how you feel,\" will make a child recoil. \"The emphasis needs to be on making these conversations spontaneous,\" says Briers, who often talks to his younger son when he's putting him to bed, whereas his older son is happier to chat over the crossword. </p> <p>Briers' methods also expect high levels of self-control from parents. \"Children will take their cues as much from what they observe in your behaviour as from the content of your words,\" he cautions. This requires you not to yell at your child to calm down when you are evidently not calm yourself. As a result, says Briers, you should probably be the one who goes to your room and only come back when you're feeling better. </p> <p>But there is something else eating at Briers. One gets the sense that he is not a big fan of the modern world. Behind his enthusiasm for stamp collecting (encourages absorption and focus) and assembling a special box of treasures, plus his horrified acknowledgement that growing numbers of children just want to be celebrities, there is another subject skulking away: \"The pace of life is phenomenally fast and children now have many opportunities for rapid gratification through computer games. My instincts tell me that our environment a few decades ago, when there were fewer distractions, less stimulus, required people to develop a different consciousness and I suspect there was something a lot healthier about that.\" </p> <p>Moreover, Briers may be the first psychologist in a long while whose aim is to write himself out of a job. What happens if parents become so expert they no longer need him? \"Frankly, who cares,\" he says. \"If psychologists become redundant that is an index of positive social change and I would be very happy to retrain as a carpenter.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Superpowers for Parents: The Psychology of Great Parenting and Happy Children by Stephen Briers is published by Prentice Hall Life, \u00a39.99</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Guardian, January 8 1953 </strong></p> <p>This year has been a harrowing one in America in many ways, but in one respect it shook off at least an infamous if waning habit. It was the first year on record that there was no lynching in the United States. The good word was reported last night by the Tuskegee Institute, the negro college established by the state of Alabama in 1881, which has kept records of all lynchings and race riots since the year after its founding.</p> <p>In the intervening 70 years only the six states of New England have never lynched anybody. Thirty-seven states have at some time or another lynched a negro. But in this century the annual incidence of lynching has declined <br>steeply. In the last 10 years of the nineteenth century the annual average was 154. From 1920 to 1930 it was 30, and 15 for the next 10 years. In 1945, 1947, and 1951 there was only one American death by lynching. </p> <p>The word, which has the strict meaning of illegal execution by a mob, has no proved origin. It has been variously derived from Lydford in England to the Lynches of South Carolina. The writer and lexicographer HL Mencken says that the likeliest claim is that of \"Captain Charles Lynch of Virginia, a primeval 100% American who devoted himself to harassing Loyalists before and during the Revolution.\"</p> <p>By any other name, the practice of lynching got off to a brisk start during the sittings of the popular tribunals that looked for and found disloyalty to the new Republic rampant throughout the victorious colonies. But lynching came to be thought of as a peculiar American institution during the period of westward expansion, when desperadoes of every sort preyed on the frail civil governments of the shifting western frontier.</p> <p>Yet it is not the righteous vigilantes of the west that come to mind when the word is mentioned: it is the negro. And the record of lynchings since the late 1880s has been overwhelmingly the record of negroes taken out of a local gaol and hanged or shot by a mob for proved or alleged rape or homicide. Three-quarters of the victims in the Tuskegee records have been negroes. And since the numbers dwindled, more than 91% of them have been negroes. </p> <p>The institute, however, tempers its pride in the new record by warning about \"other patterns of violence\" that are replacing lynch law. The most marked since the last war is the practice of bombing private homes, especially 'where members of the race have moved into what were considered white neighbourhoods.' Occasionally, the report says, the victims are \"negro leaders who were thought to be too active in improving the status of their people.\"</p> <p>From the ghastly race riot in Detroit in 1943 to the bombing of a negro's home in Florida last year, it is plain that the most inflammable places are urban areas where negroes have spilled over districts traditionally inhabited by poor whites. The poorer the white the tighter is the social tension when negroes rent houses nearby. The day after the Detroit riot nine years ago I remember one shabby, raddled white man confessing in a corner saloon: \"I may be low and poor but I ain't as low as a nigger - not yet\".</p> <p>It is a text for sociologists and housing experts. And little good will be done unless they discover some methods of easing the housing conditions of poor whites whose only hold on dignity is their pale face.</p>",
  "<p>In 1941 the British film-maker Thorold Dickinson, then 38, received one of David O Selznick's famous cables - \"2,500 words, it was\" - inviting him to Hollywood. It was a chance to follow in the footsteps of his fellow countryman and acquaintance Alfred Hitchcock, who had gone before, and it was a turning point in Dickinson's career. Or could have been. \"I simply replied: 'Sorry ... there's a war on.' But it was an open-sesame to Hollywood. Had I gone, everything would have been utterly different.\"</p> <p>What earned Dickinson Selznick's \"open-sesame\" was the brilliance of his 1940 film Gaslight, based on the play by Patrick Hamilton, an oppressively claustrophobic period thriller exposing what Dickinson called \"the worst side of the Victorian male's attitude to women\". This tale of murder, insane greed and extreme mental torture starred Anton Walbrook and Diana Wynyard, and was something special. As Dickinson said, \"Something happened on that film, we had a close-knit intensity.\" </p> <p>Gaslight has a sharp awareness of the pressures of English class and manners, which heightens the cruelty. The servants are always present as an audience for the persecuting husband to play to, sharpening the wife's humiliation as he deliberately drives her mad. Dickinson, who was brought on to the project at three weeks' notice, introduced details he remembered from the Victorian households in which he'd grown up, and insisted on shooting in sequence on a closed set. Among the film's admirers is Stephen Fry, who recently singled it out as a favourite: \"Human angst, madness, evil - true evil, love, disappointment: all the great emotions are there - but constrained, which makes them all the more powerful.\"</p> <p>It's a great British film; but it's typical of Dickinson's luck that - quite apart from the bad timing of Selznick's offer - things went wrong. The success of the Broadway production of the Hamilton play, and the excellence of Dickinson's own film (which had not yet been released in the US), persuaded MGM to buy the rights from British National. George Cukor went on to make a grander version under the same title with Ingrid Bergman (who won an Oscar for her performance) and Charles Boyer. All prints of the Dickinson version were destroyed - bar one, surreptitiously struck by Dickinson himself before the negative was removed. He was not allowed to show it to anyone, even though it was the ideal film industry calling card.</p> <p>He must have felt the fates were against him. His career was beset by unlucky accidents, with many openings quickly closing and projects folding. Influential friends went off to Hollywood; the British film industry repeatedly plunged into crisis; a world war broke out; Technicolor location footage was ruined; he fell seriously ill; India (where he was planning a film) dissolved into civil unrest; Hollywood censored a script about Machiavelli and Cesare Borgia, based on Somerset Maugham's Then and Now (to have starred Trevor Howard and George Sanders); British penny-pinching nixed what might have been a tremendous Mayor of Casterbridge (the script is brilliant) with Ralph Richardson as Henchard.</p> <p>Still, he had more chances than many, and on the two occasions when he was brought in at the last minute (both times by Walbrook) he made his greatest films, evidently liberated by the situation to show his skill as an improviser. His highest achievement is The Queen of Spades (1949), based on Pushkin's 1834 story and judged by Martin Scorsese \"a masterpiece, one of the very best films of the 40s\". Brought in to direct at only five days' notice, Dickinson persuasively recreated St Petersburg in 1815 on a shoestring, and all in a tiny old studio in Welwyn Garden City, next door to the Shredded Wheat factory. It's an astonishing piece of work, an intense study of desire, ruthless ambition and madness, with great performances from Walbrook as the obsessed Suvorin and Edith Evans as the Old Countess who has sold her soul to the devil. Dickinson weaves a hallucinatory vision from Oliver Messel's magnificent sets, Otto Heller's fluid cinematography and Georges Auric's richly various, atmospheric score.</p> <p>By the time he started to direct in the mid-1930s, Dickinson had been in films a long time. In 1925 he'd interrupted his studies at Oxford to work in France with the British director George Pearson, the father of an Oxford friend. Like his near-contemporary Michael Powell, he picked up an all-round training in that free-and-easy milieu - as well as managing to watch Abel Gance shooting Napol\u00e9on next door. In the late 1920s he went to New York to examine the competing systems in the transition to sound, and on his return to London became involved with the Film Society, set up not long before by George Bernard Shaw and HG Wells and attended by Virginia Woolf among others. In the spare time left him by his editing work, he programmed foreign films, and met visiting directors including Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov. A lifetime supporter of the film society movement, he proselytised tirelessly for what he called \"cinematic literacy\" in a Britain that undervalued film. </p> <p>Politics - especially international politics - played a great part in Dickinson's life. His work took him to France, America, East and West Africa, the Soviet Union, India on the eve of partition, Italy not long after Mussolini and Israel, where he made the remarkable Hill 24 Doesn't Answer (1955), set during the war of 1948. As the artist, film-maker and curator Lutz Becker recalls, \"Thorold, who stated that he was totally non-political, expressed his political views very forcefully and was a founding member and lifelong supporter of ACT, the film trade union.\" Dickinson was a man of the left, though not the hard left. Indignant at the mainstream media portrayals of the Spanish civil war, he endured the air raids of Barcelona in 1938 to make the subtle short film Spanish ABC. Back in England, he was officially labelled a \"premature anti-fascist\", as he subsequently found when he became involved in wartime propaganda work - making The Prime Minister (1941), with John Gielgud as Disraeli, and the impressive \"Careless Talk Costs Lives\" thriller The Next of Kin (1942). And as part of his contribution to the war effort, Dickinson gave the sympathetic leading role to a black actor, Robert Adams, in a thoughtful, liberal colonial drama - with a troubled production history - about the future of African civilisation, Men of Two Worlds (1946).</p> <p>A supporter of the Popular Front in the 1930s, Dickinson, like many others, turned against the USSR at the time of the Nazi-Soviet pact; and Secret People (1952), his film about political violence, was a commercial disaster partly because the Communist party organised demonstrations against it. As he put it, \"To . . . find oneself associated with the right wing is just bloody comic.\" Secret People, featuring a young Audrey Hepburn alongside Serge Reggiani and Valentina Cortese, is a moving story, set in the 1930s, about the moral and emotional costs of political violence. Its heroine is persuaded to help with what Auden notoriously called \"the necessary murder\" - of a dictator who has had her father killed - but the film's heartfelt motto is the same poet's wiser line, \"We must love one another or die.\"</p> <p>In two decades of directing, Dickinson made only nine films, each strikingly different from the others. Despite his small output, he has eminent admirers. Graham Greene praised his second film, the low-budget, breezily inventive comedy-thriller The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939), calling it \"as good to watch as either of the Thin Man films: [Dickinson] gives us wit instead of facetiousness - wit of cutting and wit of angle\". For Scorsese, whose regard for Dickinson's achievement has been crucial in the effort to bring him back to wider attention, \"he belongs in the first rank of British film-makers\", while for John Boorman, he had \"Michael Powell's daring, David Lean's taut editing and Carol Reed's emotional tension\".</p> <p>Above all, Dickinson's films are swift, often exhilarating, with a mobile camera and a great dramatic instinct for shifting compositions. The years he spent editing before directing gave him a keen sense of how cinema worked. \"To edit films efficiently,\" he wrote in 1935, \"takes all the nerve, power of concentration and courage that a man possesses.\" Four decades later, he declared: \"When you're working in these divisions of a second, you realise what cinema is.\" </p> <p>He was in the technical vanguard during the transition to sound, and his experience in sound-editing left its mark in his often thrilling handling of the relation between sound and image, as well as his Powell-like sensitivity to music (his scores were composed by, among others, Richard Addinsell, William Walton, Arthur Bliss, Georges Auric and the Catalan exile Roberto Gerhard). There's a dry, understated irony in his films, too - the delicately weighed style conveys the quiet presence of a controlling sensibility, compassionate and emotionally involved, aware of human cruelty, but not without humour. Dickinson's best movies, and the best scenes in all his movies, flow in a way that is extremely unusual in British cinema - which makes it all the more frustrating that he had such a difficult career.</p> <p>He gave up directing at 52, and became head of film production at the United Nations in New York, where he supervised many enterprising films. In 1960 he returned to London and set up Britain's first university department of film studies at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London; in 1967 he became the country's first professor of film studies. Tall, bespectacled, toothy, giggly, open to new ideas, charismatic, he was an inspiring figure. One of his students, Gavin Millar, recalls Karel Reisz talking about why Dickinson hadn't made more films: \"I think that Thorold was too good for the business. People just didn't understand him. He wanted to make great films, and he didn't believe in making artistic compromises just to make money. And he believed that people were as idealistic and good-hearted as he was.\" </p> <p>Looking back, Dickinson commented: \"I was so fed up with the British film situation all through the 1950s. So humdrum. I couldn't find anything that I wanted to do and that any distributor wanted to distribute.\" He wouldn't compromise. In his book A Discovery of Cinema (1971), there's an unsurprising acerbity about producers and studios: \"It is the incomprehension of these men, who hold us all enmeshed in their bank balances, which inhibits and imprisons the artists and strangles ideas at birth.\" The driven Selznick, who also, in his own way, cared passionately about the work, might have been an exception.</p> <p>\u2022 Tharald Dickinson: A World of Film, edited by Philip Horne and Peter Swaab, is published by Manchester University Press.

  "<p>Important and timely news from the Journal of Medical Hypotheses this week: ejaculating could be \"a potential treatment of nasal congestion in mature males\". My reason for bothering you with this will become clear later. The first thing to note is that this is not an entirely ludicrous idea, but it is a tenuous one. </p> <p>Most decongestant pills work by increasing the activity in the \"sympathetic nervous system\", which is involved in lots of largely automatic things in the body, such as sweating, blood pressure, and pupil size, as well as the \"fight or flight\" mechanism. More activitity in the sympathetic system causes the vessels of the nasal mucosa to constrict, reducing their volume, so clearing the blockage.</p> <p>The argument from Dr Sina Zarrintan runs: \"The emission phase of ejaculation is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system ... ejaculation will stimulate adrenergic receptors ... and stimulation of your adrenergic receptors gives you relief from your cold.\" </p> <p>It's a chain of reasoning that would make a nutritionist blush, and has already been responded to in a letter, entitled Ejaculation as a treatment for nasal congestion in men is inconvenient, unreliable and potentially hazardous. The letter explains that ejaculation increases blood pressure and heart rate, increases androgens, which could increase prostate cancer, and so on.</p> <p>Now I genuinely love the Journal of Medical Hypotheses (published by Elsevier). Last year, you will remember, they carried an almost surreally crass paper in which two Italian doctors argued that \"mongoloid\" really was an appropriate term for people with Down's syndrome, because such people shared many characteristics with oriental populations (including sitting cross-legged, eating different types of food containing MSG [monosodium glutamate], and enjoying handicrafts). The journal's articles are routinely quoted with great authority in the output of antivaccination conspiracy theorists, miracle-cure marketeers, and other interesting characters. The periodical can also print some interesting stuff. But it also acts as an extreme example of something we should all be aware of: you're not supposed to take everything in an academic journal as read, final and valid.</p> <p>The editor of this journal, Bruce Charlton, once gave me two excellent reasons for publishing loopy papers (my phraseology). The first was that academics had to be free to just get on and publish things that outsiders might find weird or misinterpret, without worrying about what the wider public thinks. The Down's syndrome paper was simply uninformative and offensive, pushing this line to the limit. But excepting such cases, this is a view I heartily endorse.</p> <p>Academics should be free to write tenuous papers, and the infamous 1998 MMR Lancet paper is a perfect example: it covered 12 children who had autism and some bowel problems, and had been given the MMR vaccine. It didn't tell us much about MMR causing autism, but no one should censor themselves from publishing such work on the off-chance it might trigger a 10-year epic scare story from mischievous journalists.</p> <p>Charlton also raises a more interesting point. He feels that the ideas market needs a diverse range of outlets, so his journal is deliberately not \"peer-reviewed\" - the process whereby the great and the good decide if your paper is worth publishing, or, indeed, if it is methodologically flawed. Peer review has worked OK-ish - stopping utter nonsense appearing in high-quality journals - but it acts as no bar to nonsense getting in to obscure peer-reviewed journals (where the bar's lower), and is vulnerable to bullying and corruption.</p> <p>Two weeks ago we saw that only one in four cancer trials were published. There are widespread demands that all negative findings be published, so that at least they are accessible. But this will often mean that inadequately analysed data from less competent studies gets published in journals that will take poor quality papers. The signal-to-noise ratio in the scientific literature is getting ever lower, and the simple fact that something has been \"published\" is becoming as meaningless as it always should have been: ideas are there to be read and critically appraised. Science is not about arguing from authority, and the era of \"it's published so it must be true\" is mercifully drawing to a close.</p> <p>Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",

She is not acting like someone who could be president of the United States and John McCain is one heart attack away,\" said Priscilla Glascock, a 26-year-old nurse who is supporting Barack Obama. \"The men are going to love it,\" she sneered.</p> <p>Not just the men. \"I think it's hysterical,\" said Amanda Day, 36, a business consultant who is voting Republican. \"I think women can relate with being in a situation where it's very serious, you kind of have to step back and add that humour, whether it's a wink or it's a shrug.\"</p> <p>But for the host Kit Pepper, 52, a member of the non-partisan League of Women Voters, Palin's winking was an affront to the years she spent trying to build up her own political consultancy firm in a male-dominated world.</p> <p>\"She winked at us,\" Pepper said in disbelief. \"All the claims that the media is sexist and the Democrats are being sexist are out the window. The fact that this woman as a vice-presidential candidate stood on national TV and winked at me completely insults me.\"</p> <p>Pepper's home in Winter Park, just outside Orlando, is in the politically volatile swath of central Florida - the main battlefield in a battleground state.</p> <p>Half of her neighbours have McCain lawn signs, the rest are with Obama. When the guests started arriving with bottles of red wine labelled \"Bitch\" and \"Red Truck\" and McCain dancing dolls, they too evenly divided along party lines, choosing colour-coded name tags: red for Republicans, blue for Democrats, and gold for Undecided.</p> <p>But while the partisan loyalties were established well in advance, the Palin-Biden show soon moved into unfamiliar terrain as the first vice-presidential debate between a male and a female candidate in a generation. For the two dozen women guests, ranging in age from late teens to their 60s, it was impossible to overlook Palin's use of her femininity and Biden's efforts to avoid making gender-related gaffes.</p> <p>The guests whooped when the CNN reaction meter consistently showed Palin getting a more enthusiastic response from male viewers than women. Biden, in contrast, was a bigger hit with women.</p> <p>But their own reactions also mixed up the dividing lines of politics and gender. Some of the staunchest Democrats had a sneaking admiration for Palin's audacity - even while handing the debate to Biden on substance. \"She is owning it now. Look at her,\" said Margaret Nolan, a management consultant. \"You go girl.\"</p> <p>Some of the Republicans could not help disassociating themselves from Palin - even while praising her skill at using winks and a folksy turn of phrase to connect with middle America.</p> <p>\"I can't imagine myself doing that wink,\" said Lydia Gardner, a Republican local government official first elected in 1987. \"I lived in Boston. I lived in Washington and I went to a very cosmopolitan and very sophisticated university where that wink maybe would not have been done. But for her, and for where she is from and for her background it's perfectly appropriate.\"</p> <p>Pepper had organised her party half-expecting Palin to self-destruct. Day, on the opposite end of the political spectrum, admitted she had switched off the television set this week during Palin's now notorious interview with CBS. \"It was just too embarrassing,\" she said.</p> <p>By the end of the night, most of the party agreed Palin had made no significant stumbles. But even as Palin's little flourishes became an Alaskan blizzard of doggone its, bless their hearts, darn rights, hecks, and you betchas, she did not inspire confidence either.</p> <p>From the depths of the overstuffed sofa, Day gave Biden much higher marks on substance. \"He walked all over her on foreign policy,\" she said, but then argued that Americans don't vote on international issues anyway.</p> <p>Palin also failed to dispel the impression that she had been fed her lines by Republican handlers and was dutifully spitting them out again. \"If I hear her say the word 'maverick' one more time I am going to shoot somebody - and I am a Republican,\" said Lisa Romine.</p> <p>If Biden felt a similar frustration, he hid it fairly well from the women in the room, but Barbara Nelen, 52, a massage therapist who wore an \"undecided\" name tag, thought she picked up some condescension. \"At certain times, he just let out a big sigh,\" she said. \"It was pretty clear he looked down on her.\"</p> <p>Her daughter, Alexa, a student voting for the first time, did not feel for Palin. \"I think she is trying to be more of a motivational speaker than telling us what she would do in the government.\"</p> <p>When it was over, Day clenched both fists in the air like a prize fighter and screamed. \"She survived, she survived.\"</p> <p>Even the Democrats had to agree. Palin had survived - doggone it.</p>",
  "<p>While the talking heads were nattering on about Sarah Palin's debate, I can promise you that the real political professionals were obsessing about something else entirely on Thursday evening.</p> <p>The news that John McCain was pulling out of Michigan - closing offices and dispersing his staff to other states - was in reality the biggest US political news of the week now ending. Let's look closely at why.</p> <p>An American presidential election is won on a state-by-state basis. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes, based on the number of seats the state has in the lower federal house, the House of Representatives, plus two (because each state has two senators). Representation in the lower house is decided by population.</p> <p>For example, Ohio, with a population of 11.5 million, has 20 electoral votes - 18 congressional districts plus two seats in the Senate. Wyoming, population 520,000, has three - one congressional district plus two Senate seats. Add them all up and the total comes to 538 electoral votes. A majority of 538 - half plus one - is 270, and that's what a candidate needs to win.</p> <p>A good way to think of a presidential contest is to picture the two candidates as a political version of Karpov and Kasparov, and the United States as their giant chessboard, around which they must strategically move their pieces to win the combination of states that will get them to 270. </p> <p>Remember that competing in the various states costs money. The campaigns have to calculate everything from the cost of driving voters to the polls on election day to the price of 30 seconds of television advertising time in Orlando, Florida versus Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p> <p>So there's your background. Now, what's the current situation, and what are the ramifications of McCain running up the white flag in Michigan?</p> <p>Michigan is a \"blue\" state, having voted for Al Gore and John Kerry. But it didn't do so by wide margins, and it's one that McCain's people had very much been hoping to pick off and turn red. It has 17 electoral votes. Only seven states have more. McCain winning Michigan would have been a very big deal. But that's seemingly off the table now, barring some shocking development.</p> <p>Meanwhile, let's look at the other battleground states. The list is roughly as follows: Florida (27 electoral votes), Ohio (20), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), Indiana (11), Colorado (nine), Iowa (seven), New Mexico (five) and New Hampshire (four). That's nine states worth a total of 111 electoral votes.</p> <p>Here's the interesting thing about those nine states: eight of them voted for George Bush in 2004. Only the smallest one - New Hampshire - went for Kerry. This means that the battle is taking place on what used to be almost entirely red territory but is now up for grabs.</p> <p>By contrast, aside from New Hampshire, there isn't a single Kerry state where McCain currently has more-or-less even footing in the polls. A few are close-ish - a margin for Barack Obama of five points or fewer - notably Pennsylvania (21) and Minnesota (10). But in none would you say today that McCain is poised to capture it.</p> <p>In other words, Obama's pawns and knights are advancing across the board. That he will no longer have to fight over Michigan means he can redeploy the troops to, say, Indiana. If he can pick off that state, which hasn't voted Democratic since 1964: checkmate.</p> <p>Here's the matter as straightforwardly as I can put it. Kerry won 251 electoral votes. Assume that Obama can hold those - by no means a given, but something he seems positioned today to do. Add Iowa, which Kerry lost but where Obama is comfortably ahead. That's 258. </p> <p>Taking Iowa off the board means that eight battleground states remain, totalling 104 electoral votes. Obama needs to win only 12 of those 104 - one or at most two states. And today, he is currently leading or tied in six of them.</p> <p>McCain will push extra-hard into Pennsylvania. Two more debates will arrive. And who knows what new national or international crisis looms that might completely change the dynamic of the race. But with a month to go, the chessboard is assuming shape. White's king is exposed.</p>",
  "<p>This is the first time in the history of the United States that the president has sought to provoke a financial panic to <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/BUSINESS07/81002056\">get legislation passed</a> through Congress. While this has proven to be a successful political strategy - after the House of Representatives finally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy2\">passed the bank bail-out plan</a> today - it marks yet another low point in American politics.</p> <p>It was incredibly irresponsible for George Bush to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/07448d80-8aab-11dd-a76a-0000779fd18c.html\">tell the American people on national television</a> that the country could be facing another Great Depression. By contrast, when we actually were in the Great Depression, <a href=\"http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrfirstinaugural.html\">President Roosevelt</a> said: \"We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.\" </p> <p>It was even more irresponsible for President Bush to seize on the decline in the stock market five days later as evidence that his bailout was needed for the economy. President Bush must surely understand, as all economists know, that the daily swings in the stock market are driven by mass psychology and have almost nothing to do with the underlying strength in the economy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/29/us.economy.wall.street\">scare tactics</a> of President Bush, Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, and Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, created sufficient panic, so that by the time of the first vote on the emergency package in Congress, much of the public believed that the defeat of the bail-out may actually have had serious consequences for the economy. Millions of people have changed their behaviour because of this fear, with many pulling money out of bank and money market accounts, and adjusting their financial plans in other ways. </p> <p>This effort to promote panic is especially striking since the country's dire economic situation is almost entirely the result of the Bush administration's policy failures. First and foremost, the decision of Paulson and Bernanke (and previously Alan Greenspan) to ignore the housing bubble, allowed for the growth of an $8tn bubble, which is now collapsing. </p> <p>It is the collapse of this bubble - which has already destroyed more than $4tn in housing wealth, and is likely to destroy another $4tn over the next year - that is at the root of the economy's problems. While competent economists were warning of the bubble and the dire consequences of its collapse, the top officials in the Bush administration were celebrating the rise in homeownership rates.</p> <p>The Bush administration made the crisis even worse by deregulating Wall Street. This led to the huge over-leveraging of financial institutions, which has vastly complicated the country's economic policies. It is especially disturbing that Secretary Paulson personally profited from these policies, earning millions of dollars in compensation from Goldman Sachs during his years there as its chief executive.</p> <p>The collapse of the housing bubble, while falling short of the magnitude of the Great Depression, is likely to lead to the worst recession since the second world war. Repairing the damage caused by this bubble will be a long and difficult process. Cleaning up the damage to the political system from President Bush's unprecedented fear campaign may prove to be even more difficult.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/02/ian.blair.resigns\">resignation of Sir Ian Blair</a> from his job as chief of the Metropolitan police is a tragic story in the full Aristotelian sense: \"presenting a reversal of fortune, involving persons renowned and of superior attainments\". </p> <p>Few chief officers have started with so much promise. When I studied chief constables for a book in the late 1980s only 25% had degrees, and none had entered the police as graduates. Sir Ian entered the met in 1974 with an Oxford degree in English. In 1985 he published a book <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;id=8gYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Investigating+Rape&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fOdBtasQkZ&amp;sig=CgqQV1ONTfLHbHrwaFFzdO1Z3mw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result\">Investigating Rape</a> that played a significant role in improving procedures for dealing with rape victims. He became chief constable of Surrey in 1998 at the age of 44 (the typical age of appointment to chief constable I found in my study was 52). He is a visiting fellow of Nuffield College Oxford, and of New York University, and many of his speeches advocating a more diverse police force had attracted significant public attention before he became commissioner in 2005. He was only the second commissioner to be invited by the BBC to deliver the distinguished <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4443386.stm\">Dimbleby lecture</a>. He deserves the sobriquet \"Descartes of Dock Green\" every bit as much as its recipient <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/11/brian.paddick.profile\">Brian Paddick</a>, another distinguished \"thinking person's copper\" with whom Blair acrimoniously fell out. </p> <p>Blair has been hounded by the right-wing press, especially the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1066305/Met-chief-Sir-Ian-Blair-paid-friend-figure-sum-help-sharpen-image.html\">Daily Mail</a>, throughout his years at the met, loathed and lampooned as the \"pc PC\". </p> <p>Mystery and paradox surround his fall. How did the champion of diversity come to clash so publicly and poisonously with Paddick, the first openly gay senior officer? Why has he fallen out so disastrously with two senior minority ethnic officers and the <a href=\"http://www.nationalbpa.com/\">Black Police Association</a>, who should have been his natural allies? How could a chief officer celebrated for communication skills be caught out with so many gaffes in handling the media? The moral cesspit that the tabloid press have largely become is a crucial cause, but Blair often mishandled matters. He was right, for example, to attack the pattern of media crime coverage as institutionally racist, but to illustrate this by wondering why the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/sep/30/soham.uknews\">Soham murders</a> attracted so much concern was both insensitive and naive. The most serious issues surround his handling of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/23/london\">mistaken killing on July 22 2005 of the innocent Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes</a> at Stockwell tube station during the hunt for the terrorists responsible for the abortive bombings the previous day. </p> <p>The crucial question was how Blair gave the media false information. On the Friday afternoon and evening of the shooting a growing number in the commissioner's inner circle realised the Met had killed a completely innocent man. Yet Sir Ian was telling the media that they had no identification of the victim, and went home that night apparently not knowing what had happened. Blair's account is that he was only informed an innocent man had been shot at 10.30am the next morning. </p> <p>This leaves an unpalatable dilemma. Did the commissioner knowingly lie to the public? Or was he misled? The <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/\">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> (IPCC) cleared the commissioner of issuing deliberate falsehoods. But they did \"find it somewhat surprising ... that nobody sought to inform the commissioner of the evidence of error that was in the hands of his closest colleagues as early as the mid-afternoon on the day of the shooting\". Despite the long IPCC investigation and report who-knew-what-when on that fatal Friday remains shrouded in mystery. </p> <p>Most of the debate so far has concentrated on the culpability or achievements of Blair as an individual. The blogosphere has mainly followed the right-wing press in celebrating his departure: to them he was both knave and buffoon, an over-promoted puppet of New Labour. To a few he is the victim of the conservative resurgence encapsulated above all by Boris Johnson's election as London mayor, and his hounding by the Mail masks his achievements in bringing down crime through the successful spread of <a href=\"http://www.neighbourhoodpolicing.co.uk/\">Neighbourhood Policing.</a> But his fall raises much more fundamental questions about the politics of policing today.<br> An immediate question is whether a liberal intellectual can succeed as a chief officer in the face of today's predominantly right-wing, know-nothing media. It seems to me no coincidence that the only other chief officer forced out in recent times was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/03/ukcrime.rebeccaallison\">Paul Whitehouse of Sussex</a>, also a notably liberal and cerebral commander, and also because of misleading statements in the wake of a wrongful shooting by detectives. </p> <p>The most successful reformers seem to be those such as <a href=\"http://greaterlondonlieutenancy.org.uk/about-us/the-lord-imbert.cfm\">Peter (now Lord) Imbert</a>, who carry credibility with the rank-and-file as coppers with hard-end street experience, together with formidable intelligence lightly worn. </p> <p>But the Blair debacle dramatically illustrates some even more fundamental issues about the contemporary politics of law and order. The police today are caught in a trap of impossible demands. The prime culprit is the neoliberalism launched by Reaganomics and Thatcherism. This generated enormous criminogenic pressures, because of the social tsunami flowing from unemployment and inequality, and the egoistic amoral culture with which it went hand-in-hand: economic and moral laissez-faire. </p> <p>The destruction of the informal social controls that held crime in check placed the whole burden of maintaining order on policing and punishment. The fatal embrace of the neoliberal settlement by New Labour and Clintonian Democrats in the early 1990s locked into place a new law and order consensus, in which crime was not only seen as public enemy No 1, but as controllable by tough law and order solutions. To talk of social roots of crime other than individual moral failings was to be \"soft\" on it, a fatal political liability. Crime did indeed fall in the 1990s and 2000s, largely because of the benign economic climate. Home Office calculations themselves attributed 80% of the crime drop to economic factors, but this was a success that dared not speak its name, and New Labour claim it for their tougher policing and penal policies. </p> <p>The problems facing chief officers and indeed all police have multiplied dramatically. The toughest, and even the smartest, policing can at best only offer temporary first-aid for these problems. But contemporary discourse about crime occludes its real sources in the political economy and culture of neoliberalism. The primary responsibility for delivering security is now placed on the police, while at the same time the law and order framework that dominates media and political discourse martyrs chief officers and policymakers like Ian Blair who seek smart solutions.</p>",
  "<p>I still cringe at the thought of autumn, 2004. That fall, two contests took place that would decide the fate of America for the near future. One was an <a href=\"http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20041027&amp;content_id=906996&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos\">epic disaster</a>, a result that set the US on a terrible path. In the other, George Bush was re-elected as president.</p> <p>Yes, as a New York native, I place the <a href=\"http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos\">Boston Red Sox</a> winning the World Series for the first time since 1918 as a worse happenstance than the worst president of all time gaining a second term. And as the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp\">Major League Baseball</a> playoffs get underway again this week, let's hope we avoid a similar fate.</p> <p>That autumn four years ago was supposed to be different. John Kerry was the Massachusetts icon who was to be victorious, and <a href=\"http://americanhistory.about.com/od/elections/a/baseballpres.htm\">history suggested</a> that this did not bode well for the American League Red Sox. There was a long stretch, from 1952 to 1976, when the World Series accurately predicted the presidential election, with an AL victory in the Fall Classic presaging a Republican in the Oval Office. But that fell away until 2000, when the <a href=\"http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nyy\">Yankees</a> swept the <a href=\"http://mrudolf.tripod.com/subway/\">crosstown</a> <a href=\"http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nym\">Mets</a> and George Bush stole the election from Al Gore. 2004 made it two in a row. At least the team Bush used to own, the Texas Rangers, has never sniffed a championship, which likely <a href=\"http://austin.about.com/cs/bushbiographies/a/bush_background.htm\">hurts</a> Bush more than any failure as president.</p> <p>So as a Barack Obama supporter, it behoves me to root for the National League, which has been inferior, it should be said, in the last few years (the AL has won eight of the last 12 series). That could mean the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc\">Chicago Cubs</a>, who had the best record in the league this season. And check it out - Barack is from the Windy City. Trouble is, he is a stated <a href=\"http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cws\">White Sox</a> fan and celebrated in 2005 when they won their first World Series since 1917.</p> <p>If he's superstitious, he might look at the history books and ease away from the Sox, which are in the AL. And he is a politician, after all, so if the Cubs manage to climb out of the current two-games-to-none hole they are in and advance, don't be surprised if he starts making speeches wearing a blue Cubs hat. Perhaps it's best if someone else wins, just to prevent any taunting from the same media that made \"lipstick on a pig\" a breaking news event. Anyone but Boston, that is.</p> <p>As for John McCain, his home state <a href=\"http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=ari\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, in which his wife Cindy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93567413\">owns a stake</a>, held a secure lead in the NL West division for much of the season, until those coastal elites from Hollywood brought in Palinesque innocent Manny Ramirez, who led the <a href=\"http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=la\">Dodgers</a> on a surge past the Snakes. It can be argued persuasively that McCain's true home team is the Washington Nationals, as he has been a creature of the capital for decades. That doesn't bode well for the aged senator, either - the Nats finished 59-102, 32.5 games behind the winners from the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the <a href=\"http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=phi\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.</p> <p>It is, of course, asinine to tie together the World Series and the election, as I found out to my horror last cycle. Still, with the breakdown in the economy, the rhythms of the national pastime are comforting. It's why FDR kept the leagues going during the second world war and play resumed rapidly after 9/11. But if Obama loses and the Red Sox win again, I may just move to a cricket-playing country.</p>",
  "<p>State authorities in Nebraska are reeling from a sudden spate of children being abandoned by their parents and guardians under a new law that allows caregivers to leave any child up to the age of 19 at hospitals without fear of prosecution.</p> <p>In September alone, 14 children were abandoned in hospitals and another mistakenly taken to a police station that is not covered under the law.</p> <p>In a further case, an 18-year-old presented himself for safe keeping, but was not placed in foster care because he was too old.</p> <p>The single case that has caused most attention was that of a father who handed over nine of his 10 children aged 20 months to 17 years over to hospital carers. They have been placed with two sets of relatives before their fate is decided.</p> <p>In July Nebraska became the last of the 50 states to pass legislation designed to take criminality out of the abandonment of babies and infants, following a reported rise in such incidents. </p> <p>The process began with Texas, which enacted the law in 1999, and since then there are thought to have been about 2,000 babies handed over nationwide.</p> <p>The Nebraska law, however, went much further than any other state in keeping the definition of those who could be relinquished by their carers very loose. In most states, it was restricted to the early months of life, but in Nebraska it has been left open as \"child\" of any age up to 19.</p> <p>The first to make use of the law was a woman in Omaha who attempted on September 1 to part company with her 14-year-old son saying she did not want to care for him anymore. </p> <p>She made the mistake, under the terms of the legislation, of presenting him at Omaha police department.</p> <p>On September 13 a grandmother took her 11-year-old grandson to a hospital in Omaha complaining he was violent and destructive and saying he would be better off in a group home. The boy is now in foster care.</p> <p>The same day a boy aged 15 was abandoned in Lincoln by his aunt who said he was disobedient and a possible gang member. \"I didn't abandon him,\" she told the Omaha World Herald. \"I wanted help for him so when he hits 18 he's not a menace to society.\"</p> <p>Two further cases occurred on the 20th and 23rd involving a girl aged 13 and the 18-year-old who presented himself. The next day, in two separate incidents, relatives walked away from a boy aged 11 and another 15.</p> <p>The same day Gary Staton turned up at Creighton University medical centre with all but the eldest of his 10 children. The children's mother, his wife, had died from complications in child birth in February 2007.</p> <p>Staton said that he felt overwhelmed and unable to cope with looking after the children since his wife's death.</p> <p>Nebraska residents have been shocked by the surge of abandonments.</p> <p>Corie Russell, a columnist with the local Papillion Times, wrote: \"Birth certificates aren't receipts. This isn't a store refund. And I'm definitely not giving these parents any credit for their irrational and cruel decisions.\"</p> <p>The safe haven law has also been heavily criticised by the courts. </p> <p>One judge presiding over some of the cases lambasted it as \"state-sanctioned abandonment\".</p> <p>The state's assembly members are now considering revising the legislation to narrow the definition of those children that can be given away.<br></p>",

  "<p>Brazil's minister for human rights, Paulo Vannuchi, has <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u451751.shtml\">rejected claims</a> by its armed forces that they do not have any information about the fate of up to 170 people who disappeared during the military dictatorship but whose bodies have never been found.</p> <p>Last week President Lula formally apologised, on behalf of the Brazilian state, to 13 victims of the dictatorship that governed the country between 1964 and 1985 in a public ceremony that was also attended by Brazil's leading Roman Catholic bishops. This was the first high-profile apology to the hundreds who were murdered and thousands who were tortured by the Brazilian military and follows growing calls within his government to bring some of those involved in perpetrating these crimes to justice.</p> <p>Unlike Argentina and Chile, Brazil has never put anyone on trial for the murder and widespread torture of political dissidents during its dictatorship, despite the fact many members of the present government suffered under it. Lula was, himself, imprisoned for leading strikes, and his chief of staff and potential successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/liesandvalues1\">Dilma Rouseff</a>, was viciously tortured after being arrested as a suspected guerrilla. </p> <p>In 1979 the army pushed an amnesty law through Brazil's Congress, which they controlled, to shield themselves from future prosecutions, but Brazil's minister for justice, Tarso Genro, has argued that this does not apply to crimes of torture. The Brazilian military have responded furiously to this argument, saying that it is necessary to draw a line under the past. </p> <p>Lula last week emphasized the need for reconciliation and forgiveness. However, Vannuchi responded: \"Judges must decide whether the amnesty law can cover up torture, sexual violence, decapitation and dismemberment. The law is not all encompassing and it does not cover violent crimes, assaults or terrorism.\"</p> <p>Last May a prosecutor in S\u00e3o Paulo charged former members of the military with crimes of torture. The Organisation of American States is also due to debate the compatibility of Brazil's amnesty law with international human rights norms. Similar laws have been <a href=\"3. http://www.conectas.org/en/index.php\">struck down</a> in Argentina and Chile. </p> <p>Brazil's government has also begun opening secret files, revealing some of the human rights violations carried out during the dictatorship, and may investigate officers suspected of destroying archives to hide evidence. Last month the existence of photographs showing officers posing beside the corpses of two former Communist party members was revealed in the newspaper <a href=\"4. http://www.folha.uol.com.br/\">Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo</a>. A number of Brazil's courts have also ordered the army to provide information about the whereabouts of former guerrillas, who are believed to have been buried in secret. </p> <p>Vannuchi this week again appealed to the army to come clean about the killings. He said: \"I never tire of praising the professionalism of the army that we have today. Brazil is a solid democracy, but we must have the maturity to come to terms with our past, without stigma or prejudice. Crimes that have been committed should be investigated and the individuals responsible should be brought to justice, otherwise it shames the honour of the whole force.\"</p> <p>Glenda Mezarobba, a Brazilian human rights activist who has recently completed her doctoral research on the issue, said that the establishment of the truth about what happened in the past is not just important for the victims but for the whole of Brazilian society. \"There needs to be a decisive break between the culture of impunity that existed under the dictatorship in which violence against prisoners was permitted in the name of national security and a culture based on respect for democracy and human rights.\"</p> <p>Although Brazil's dictatorship is now becoming a distant memory, the issue remains sensitive because of the continued violence within Brazilian society. Torture is widespread and systematic in Brazil, according to the UN, and its police are regularly accused of carrying out summary and arbitrary executions. Reopening the debate about what happened under the dictatorship will be controversial, particularly if Rouseff is a candidate in Brazil's next presidential election, but it is a vital part of helping the country to come to terms with its past.</p>",
  "<p>Never before perhaps has such an infinitesimally small gesture assumed such outsize importance in a presidential election as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's</a> wink.</p> <p>Because while as the cliche would have it the eyes are the window of the soul, Palin's use of her eyes was a window to the views of women voters in one of the most hotly contested bits of real estate in this election.<br>Palin's battery of eyelash batting got underway from the opening moments of Thursday night's contest against the Democrats' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> -- and so did the parsing of its significance at a debate watching party in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>. </p> <p>\"She is trying to act like a southern belle. She is not acting like someone who could be president of the United States and John McCain is one heart attack away,\" said Priscilla Glascock, 26, and a nurse who is supporting Barack Obama. \"The men are going to love it,\" she sneered.</p> <p>Not just the men. \"I think it's hysterical,\" said Amanda Day, 36, and a business consultant who is voting Republican. \"I think women can relate with being in a situation where it's very serious you kind of have to step back and add that humour whether it's a wink, or it's a shrug.\"</p> <p>But For Kit Pepper, 52, the host and a committed Democrat, Palin's winking was an affront to the years she spent trying to build up her own political consultancy firm in a male dominated world. \"She winked at us,\" Pepper said in a state of near disbelief. \"All the claims that the media is sexist and the Democrats are being sexist are out the window. The fact that this woman as a vice-presidential candidate stood on national TV and winked at me completely insults me.\"</p> <p>Pepper's home in Winter Park, just outside Orlando, is in the politically volatile swathe of central Florida -- the main battlefield in a battleground state. Half of her neighbours have McCain lawn signs, the rest are with Obama. When the guests started arriving with bottles of red wine labelled \"Bitch\" and \"Red Truck\" and McCain dancing dolls, they too evenly divided along party lines, choosing colour-coded name tags: red for Republicans, blue for Democrats, and gold for Undecided.</p> <p>But while the partisan loyalties were established well in advance, the Palin-Biden show soon moved into unfamiliar terrain as the first vice-presidential debate between a male and a female candidate in a generation.</p> <p>For the two dozen women guests, ranging in age from late teens to their sixties, it was impossible to overlook Palin's use of her feminity, and Biden's efforts to avoid making gender-related gaffes.<br>The guests whooped when the CNN reaction meter consistently showed Palin getting a more enthusiastic response from male viewers than women. Biden, in contrast, was a bigger hit with women.</p> <p>But their own reactions also mixed up the dividing lines of politics and gender. Some of the staunchest Democrats had a sneaking admiration for Palin's audacity -- even while handing the debate to Biden on substance. \"She is owning it now. Look at her,\" said Margaret Nolan, a management consultant. \"You go girl.\"</p> <p>Some of the Republicans could not help disassociating themselves from Palin -- even while praising her skill at using winks and a folksy turn of phrase to connect with middle America. \"I can't imagine myself doing that wink,\" said Lydia Gardner, a Republican local government official who was first elected in 1987. \"I lived in Boston. I lived in Washington and I went to a very cosmopolitan and very sophisticated university where that wink maybe would not have been done. But for her, and for where she is from and for her background it's perfectly appropriate.\"</p> <p>Pepper had organised her party half-expecting Palin to self-destruct. Day, on the opposite end of the political spectrum, admitted she had switched off the television set this week during Palin's now notorious interview with CBS. \"It was just too embarrassing,\" she said.</p> <p>By the end of the night, most of the party agreed Palin had made no significant stumbles. But even as Palin's folksy little flourishes became an Alaska blizzard of doggone its, bless their hearts, darn rights, hecks, and you betchas, she did not inspire confidence either.</p> <p>From the depths of the overstuffed sofa, Day gave Biden much higher marks on substance. \"He walked all over her on foreign policy,\" she said but then argued that Americans don't vote on international issues anyway.</p> <p>Palin also failed to dispel the impression that she had been fed her lines by Republican handlers and was dutifully spitting them out again. \"If I hear her say the word 'maverick' one more time I am going to shoot somebody -- and I am a Republican,\" said Lisa Romine.</p> <p>If Biden felt a similar frustration, he hid it fairly well from the women in the room, but Barbara Nelen, 52, a massage therapist who wore a gold, or neutral, name tag thought she picked up some condescension. \"At certain times, he just let out a big sigh like a bull in the field,\" she said. \"From anyone who was really watching, it was pretty clear he looked down on her.\"</p> <p>Her daughter, Alexa, a first year university student voting for the first time, did not feel for Palin. \"Personally I think she is trying to be more of a motivational speaker than telling us what she would do in the government.\"</p> <p>When it was over, Day clenched both fists in the air like a triumphant prize-fighter and screamed. \"She survived, she survived.\" Even the Democrats in the room had to agree. Palin had survived -- doggone it.</p>",
  "<p>Palin said last night and <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/?iid=redirect-thepage\">is apparently repeating today</a> that Obama should be ashamed for saying that Western forces in Afghanistan are killing civilians. She called the comment \"reckless\" and said that the remarks \"in my world disqualify someone from consideration as the next commander in chief.\"</p> <p>This goes back to something Obama said in 2007. In a non-campaign context then, it was pretty common knowledge and non especially controversial that the stepped-up air strikes at the time were indeed resulting in more civilian casualties that wasn't exactly winning the hearts and minds. Here's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081400950.html\">an Associated Press fact-check</a> that appeared in the WashPost in August 2007:</p> <blockquote> <p>A check of the facts shows that Western forces have been killing civilians at a faster rate than the insurgents have been killing civilians.</p> <p>The U.S. and NATO say they don't have civilian casualty figures, but The Associated Press has been keeping count based on figures from Afghan and international officials. Tracking civilian deaths is a difficult task because they often occur in remote and dangerous areas that are difficult to reach and verify.</p> <p>As of Aug. 1, the AP count shows that while militants killed 231 civilians in attacks in 2007, Western forces killed 286. Another 20 were killed in crossfire that can't be attributed to one party.</p> <p>Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed his concern about the civilian deaths during a meeting last week with President Bush.</p> <p>Bush said he understands the agony that Afghans feel over the loss of innocent lives and that he is doing everything he can to protect them. He said the Taliban are using civilians as human shields and have no regard for their lives.</p> <p>\"The president rightly expressed his concerns about civilian casualty,\" Bush said of Karzai. \"And I assured him that we share those concerns.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That Bush himself acknowledged the situation would seem to me a pretty effective return of serve that ought to shut this line of attack down. We shall see.<br></p>",

The vote overturned Monday's shock result in which lawmakers opposed it 228 to 205. </p> <p>The bill, which allows the US treasury to clean up banks' balance sheets by purchasing distressed mortgage-backed securities, was signed by President Bush within hours of congressional approval. </p> <p>But it came too late to prevent the worst week on Wall Street for seven years which ended with a fresh slide in stocks as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 157 points to 10,325.</p> <p>President Bush acknowledged that it had been a tough week: \"There were moments this week when some thought the federal government could not rise to the challenge.\"</p> <p>Thanking leaders of both parties for rallying support, Bush said: \"By coming together on this legislation, we have acted boldly to prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country.\"</p> <p>Business leaders hope that the rescue package will thaw out the frozen credit markets and restore confidence in struggling banks. It includes measures to limit pay for senior banking executives and to increaser the insured limit of US bank balances from $100,000 to $250,000. The treasury is likely to begin buying banks' assets this week.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben Bernanke, welcomed the plan's approval: \"The legislation is a critical step toward stabilizing our financial markets and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of credit to households and businesses.\"</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents business leaders, said: \"With the American economy on life support, Congress took the necessary step to stop the bleeding.\"</p> <p>About 40 members of the House of Representatives changed their vote to support the plan, alarmed by jittery markets and by deteriorating economic conditions. Official figures released today showed the worst drop in US employment for five years as 159,000 people disappeared from payrolls during September.</p> <p>John Lewis, a Democrat who switched sides, said: \"I have decided that the cost of doing nothing is greater than the cost of doing something.\"</p> <p>Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - expressed support for the package in spite of an estimated $100bn of controversial tax credits added to win support from waverers. These included aid for special interests including Hollywood film studios and for the manufacturers of children's wooden arrows.</p> <p>The Democratic leader in the House, Steny Hoyer, said: \"The American people expected us to act, to respond to the best extent we could, to stop the downward flow in the markets and to restore the flow of credit in the economy.\"</p> <p>There has been a dismal flow of negative financial news throughout the week including a slump in factory orders and a steady decline in house prices. John Silvia, chief US economist at the banking group Wachovia, said all the indicators pointed to a likely shrinking in the US economy in the final quarter of the year: \"You put the whole package together and basically, we're in a recession. What more can you say?\"</p> <p>Wall Street's close eye on Congress has caused difficulties in recent days. The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, caused a sell-off in insurance shares by suggesting that an unnamed \"major insurance company\" was \"on the verge of going bankrupt\" because of delays to the bail-out, which is designed to aid the financial sector by mopping up toxic securities from struggling banks.</p> <p>Critics of the bail-out still have strong reservations - some have pounced on an apparent admission by the Treasury that the figure of $700bn to buy up securities was arbitrary. Forbes magazine quoted a treasury spokeswoman saying that it was not based on any particular data point: \"We just wanted to choose a really large number.\"</p> <p>Such is the freeze on funding that the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his state may need a loan of up to $7bn from the federal government to plug a short-term financial gap caused by the credit crunch.</p> <p>\"California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short-term financing,\" said Schwarzenegger in a letter to the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p>",
  "<p>The government intervention in Belgian/Dutch financial services group <a href=\"http://www.fortis.com/general/brief.asp\">Fortis</a> came too late. The company has been facing problems for months \u2013 and the crucial difference between a financial institution and an ordinary company is that a bank cannot be given time. It deals in liquidity and can easily slip through your fingers. If this is the case, you need to come down hard. Half measures are not enough.</p> <p>There were two options: intervene by injecting capital and taking complete control of the bank. Or, what is almost always preferable, let the bank be taken over straight away by a stronger player.</p> <p>The half-hearted solution put together last weekend might have secured the Netherlands' interests in Fortis, but it has damaged the Fortis Group in Brussels. But national sensitivities in Belgium made tough moves there impossible.</p> <p>A capital injection from the government is not enough for Fortis because the lack of action over the past few months has led to lack of trust in the bank and particularly in its management. </p> <p>One manager was swapped for another on Friday and the word is that further changes are on the cards. This is all so vague and impossible to follow that confidence is far from being restored. Concrete action is the only thing that counts.</p> <p>A few months ago there was more room to manoeuvre but at that time there was not enough recognition that confidence was eroding. Immediate action would have helped then, but by last weekend, it had become irrelevant.<br>What was apparent was that Fortis' business activities were on the verge of collapse. Every company which was still doing business with the bank and had money in it had to justify itself, so everyone was running for the exit. Last week the Belgian government focused on protecting savers, but it was the company's corporate business where confidence was eroding.</p> <p>Confidence remains a problem and Fortis risks being dismantled by the market. A takeover would have stopped this. So if Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos says that <a href=\"http://bank.bnpparibas.com/en/pid496/in-brief.html\">BNP Paribas</a> offered very little for Fortis, this is only half the story. <br>What is more important: retaining Fortis' real functions and jobs or the interests of shareholders? The half-and-half solution adopted means that both sides will be worse off.</p> <p>On the Belgian market, Fortis can perhaps continue as a marginalised local player.</p> <p>And in the Netherlands? The Netherlands has voted to give a sort of solidarity levy of \u20ac4bn to Fortis Bank Nederland, which does not include <a href=\"http://www.abnamro.com/en/home.cfm\">ABN Amro</a>. Hopefully this will work, but the logic is not completely clear. Perhaps it is a political compromise.</p> <p>Compromises between national governments have to compete with increasingly elusive financial institutions, which operate far beyond their borders. Bos now has the virtually impossible task of making sure that the money in Fortis Bank Nederland does not disappear in the direction of Brussels.</p> <p>There is hope on the horizon. The damage to ABN Amro has been limited. Fortis is now being forced to sell ABN Amro. Bos and Dutch central bank president Nout Wellink have kept a cool head about ABN Amro's Dutch activities.</p> <p>ABN Amro could not be integrated into Fortis and that has is positive. It is also extremely sensible to allow the sale of ABN Amro to proceed in an orderly fashion and not to have forced it through last weekend. Speed is, however, of the essence. A too-long period of uncertainty will not benefit ABN Amro.</p> <p><em>This article first appeared in the Dutch evening paper, <a href=\"http://www.nrc.nl/international/Opinion/article2003531.ece\">NRC Handelsblad</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The French premier, Francois Fillon, today warned that the world was \"on the edge of the abyss\" as his country moved into an official recession.</p> <p>Fillon's comments, blaming an \"irresponsible\" financial system, came as the Dutch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europeanbanks\">government seized control of bancassurer Fortis's Netherlands operations</a> in a \u20ac16.8bn (\u00a313.06bn) deal greed with the Belgian and Luxembourg authorities.</p> <p>The effective nationalisation, forced upon the governments by the scale of the financial meltdown, includes Fortis's interests in Dutch bank ABN Amro.</p> <p>The shock decision came just days after the three governments injected \u20ac11.2bn into Fortis, Belgium's biggest bank, to keep it afloat.</p> <p>Fillon was speaking on the eve of today's emergency summit of EU leaders in Paris to try to find collective ways of restoring confidence.</p> <p>He said that the president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who called the talks, would propose that Europe \"make its banking systems secure, unfreeze credit and co-ordinate its economic and monetary strategy\".</p> <p>\"We do not rule out any option to guarantee that no banking institution will be forced into bankruptcy. The state will intervene each time it's necessary to secure our banking system,\" he said. However, opposition from other governments has ruled out a US-style bail-out plan.</p> <p>European governments have this week mounted rescue operations for several banks. But Gordon Brown, Germany's Angela Merkel, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi and Sarkozy are expected, at most, to agree to set aside national reserves to help ailing banks.</p> <p>The four leaders are to discuss the option of a harmonised approach to raising guarantees for bank deposits after Ireland's controversial go-it-alone decision to offer a limitless guarantee for individual savings and business deposits at six main banks.</p> <p>European commission officials indicated that the Irish government, which failed to consult it and has not yet formally notified its scheme, could be forced to rescind it under EU competition rules. Experts warned that the Irish decision could trigger a fragmentation of Europe's cross-border banks.</p> <p>The Greek government, under pressure from Brussels rowed back from its decision to mimic the Irish. Current EU laws set the minimum deposit guarantee at \u20ac20,000, but pressure is on to increase this to prevent a run on banks.</p> <p>Today's meeting is also due to discuss changes to accounting standards to avoid under-valuing banks' risky assets and curbs on executive pay in the financial sector.</p> <p>Official data said the French economy will probably contract by 0.1% in both the third and fourth quarters of 2008, following a 0.3% contraction between April and June. But the government said the economy would still register 0.9% growth for the year.</p>",
  "<p>A British mine-clearing expert who was murdered in Cambodia and his remains burned to hide the evidence was killed on the orders of the Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, a court heard today.</p> <p>The trial of five former Khmer Rouge cadres accused of the kidnap and murder of Christopher Howes, 37, more than 12 years ago, heard that the communist leader had a blanket policy to murder foreigners on the grounds that they supported the Cambodian government.</p> <p>Howes was shot within days of his capture while leading a mine-clearance team north of Siem Reap - home to the Angkor Wat temple complex - after his abductors lulled him into a false sense of security by laying out a sleeping mattress for the night and giving him fruit.</p> <p>His interpreter, Huon Houth, who was among the 30-strong team from British-based Mines Advisory Group (MAG), was murdered a day earlier when his captors deemed him \"no longer necessary\" because one of the alleged killers spoke English.</p> <p>The disappearance of the former British army engineer from Backwell, near Bristol, and Hourth remained a mystery for more than two years as Cambodia's civil war ground on in its death throes.</p> <p>Investigations by a Scotland Yard team working with the Cambodian police eventually unravelled Howes' fate, declaring he was murdered after forensic tests on bone fragments found in a fire.</p> <p>The evidence collected from witness statements in the two years after Howes' disappearance was presented at the Phnom Penh court today by former Metropolitan police anti-terrorism officer, Mike Dickson, now an advisor to the UN-backed Khmer Rouge genocide tribunal.</p> <p>The men in the dock had lived freely in the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng until their arrest a year ago despite suspicions of their involvement in the killings. A deal to end the civil war in 1998 pardoned many Khmer Rouge cadres.</p> <p>One of the accused, Khem Ngoun, 59, the former chief-of-staff of the one-legged Khmer Rouge army commander, Ta Mok, was a brigadier-general in the Cambodian army until his arrest.</p> <p>Along with the others, Loch Mao, 54, a Khmer Rouge officer who became a civil servant, Cheath Chet, 34, Puth Lim, 58, and Sin Dorn, 52, the frail Ngoun faces life imprisonment for murder and illegal detention when the investigating judge, Iv Kimsry, delivers his verdict in 10 days' time.</p> <p>In a marathon session the court heard today of the chilling last days of Howes and Hourth after their abduction on March 26 1996. Some of the de-mining team escaped almost immediately while all the others were released after Howes declined to abandon his staff to fetch ransom money.</p> <p>Howes and Hourth were taken towards Anlong Veng. But in an interview with the British detectives, Khieu Sampan, the Khmer Rouge's nominal head of state, said that Hourth was killed in Kul village after Ngoun said the interpreter was unnecessary.</p> <p>Howes was held in a school where Ngoun interrogated him, before he was taken out into the countryside to a road near the house of Mok, who passed the order to \"solve the problem\" and kill him.</p> <p>Howes was taken in a white Toyota pickup truck driven by Lim, accompanied by four guards including Ngoun, Mao, and two others, Khem Tem and Soeun Rim, who subsequently died. In a statement to police before his death, Rim said Mao killed Howes with two bullets from an AK-59 rifle provided by Ngoun.</p> <p>Both Ngoun and Mao changed earlier statements they made and maintained only Rim, who died in 2004, fired the fatal shots. Mao is adamant his weapon jammed and he could not fire.</p> <p>All the accused argued they acted on orders of the Khmer Rouge's brutal \"brother number one\" and that failure to do so would have meant certain death.</p> <p>But Lou McGrath, MAG chief executive who was present at the hearing, dismissed the defence.</p> <p>\"It's good to see this trial,\" he said. \"But I think the defence that if you don't kill others you will be killed yourself is what leads to genocide.

  "<p>I just watched a beautiful and very powerful <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/1709110?pg=embed&amp;sec=1709110\">short film about climate change</a>, written and animated by Leo Murray. It's left me with a strong sense that we need to do something really big in response to this threat. So of course that translates into writing a blog. But a blog about a big idea at least. </p> <p>Pretty much everyone seems to be in agreement that the UN meeting of parties to discuss climate change, in Copenhagen in 2009, is the last chance saloon. If the world can't agree to a global deal to bend the curve in global emissions at this meeting, then we may as well just man the metaphorical life rafts and start preparing for the worst. </p> <p>But what might a deal in Copenhagen look like? What should we be calling for? It has to have all the key countries involved \u2013 it can't go backwards from where we are now, with most developed countries (with one notable exception) now accepting a cap on their emissions. And must actually deliver something on the ground. </p> <p>My favourite idea is something I was discussing with Ann Pettifor over coffee the other day. Ann ran the Jubilee 2000 campaign and whilst she is still doing amazing work on the issue of international finance and debt, she has also now turned her attention to the problem of climate change and has kindly agreed to act as an adviser to the <a href=\"http://sandbag.org.uk/\">Sandbag</a> campaign. </p> <p>We discussed the possibility of establishing a global cap on emissions from the power sector. I mentioned a great project called <a href=\"http://carma.org/\">Carma</a> which had already done a lot of the leg work of gathering together data about the world's power stations and making them available on a searchable map. Together, the 50,000 or so stations owned by 4,000 companies documented by Carma, account for around 30% of global emissions of C02. If we could get them under control we would stand a chance of halting the increase in global emissions. The main countries that would need to be included are those with a sizeable fossil-based power sector so \u2013 US, Europe, China, Japan, India, South Africa and so on. </p> <p>Capping a single sector in this way, rather than a country's total emissions, may be more palatable for those still nervous about capping their whole economy. And the power sector is a great place to start \u2013 proven and cost effective lower carbon technologies already exist, the companies don't have to compete on a global market and the stations themselves are big enough and ugly enough to be easily regulated. Satellite technology could even help with the verification process. </p> <p>Obviously it won't be straightforward working out who gets what once the cap is set, but if we can get agreement to the principle, and set the level of the total cap in Copenhagen, then subsequent meetings can thrash out the detail. <br>This shouldn't be the only thing agreed in Copenhagen by any means, but it would be a tangible outcome, provide a truly global framework on which to build, drive investment in the right direction and reduce global emissions. </p> <p>\u0095 Bryony Worthington is the founder of the website <a href=\"http://sandbag.org.uk/\">Sandbag</a> a not-for-profit website that allows its members to buy up carbon emissions trading permits</p>",
  "<p>A Roseville, California couple who refused to sign their marriage licence because new forms don't use the terms \"bride\" and \"groom\" are filing a lawsuit claiming their rights have been violated.</p> <p>The Pacific Justice Institute announced yesterday it would file the suit today in Placer Superior Court on behalf of Rachel Bird and Gideon Codding.</p> <p>The couple is claiming the state of California does not have the right to replace the terms \"bride\" and \"groom\" with \"Party A\" and \"Party B\" on state marriage documents.</p> <p>The courts mandated state agencies use gender-neutral words on the forms after the state supreme court ruled in May that same-sex marriage is legal.</p> <p>Bird and Codding, who were married in a church ceremony in August, say they want terms on their marriage licence that have been used for generations.</p> <p>\"Our personal objective is to be honoured and recognised by the state of California as bride and groom,\" said Codding.</p> <p>Because the couple have refused to sign and file the new marriage license form, their union isn't recognised by the state.

  "<p>The company that introduced the concept of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/buyingtolet\">buy-to-let</a> hotel rooms, boasting that investors could \"earn money while others sleep,\" has fallen into administration. </p> <p>GuestInvest owned Blakes Hotel in London's Mayfair, patronised by celebrities such as Robert de Niro, Gwyneth Paltrow and Diana Ross, and was developing a string of other hotels, including one on the site of the former Whitbread Brewery in the City of London.</p> <p>Hundreds of investors paid upwards of \u00a3250,000 for a GuestInvest hotel and had the option of staying in their room for up to 52 nights a year at no or little charge, in addition to earning rental income from paying guests. </p> <p>The rooms at Blakes were on sale for \u00a31m each but were rumoured to have found few buyers. </p> <p>The firm's advertisements were plastered across London's transport network and initially, while hotel occupancy rates were buzzing and finance was cheap, investors earned returns of about 10% a year. </p> <p>In September 2006, GuestInvest's founder, Johnny Sandelson, entered into a \u00a3140m joint venture with HBOS to finance new hotel acquisitions, and brought in financier Sir Mark Weinberg as a non-executive director. </p> <p>But amid poor sales and slowing hotel occupancy rates in London it appointed Deloitte as administrators on Friday.</p> <p>Joint administrator Nick Edwards said he had immediately secured the future of Blakes but is still assessing the future of the group's other assets and the position of investors. </p> <p>HBOS said it owned 19.9% of GuestInvest but the concept just did not work out.</p> <p>Stuart Law, chief executive of property investment firm Assetz said: \"It is very sad to hear the news that GuestInvest has gone into administration following an HBOS reduction in lending facility and we hope that a new owner comes forwards shortly. </p> <p>\"Johnny Sandelson, who started the company in 2003, effectively founded the hotel room investment sector in the UK and proved that the investment model for purchasing hotel rooms is a sound one with it running for a number of years.\"</p> <p>Others blamed GuestInvest for overspending on acquisitions and development projects. </p> <p>In 2007 GuestInvest bought Blakes from the former actress Anouska Hempel for about \u00a334m and this year paid \u00a3100m for two more London hotels, near Hyde Park and Notting Hill.</p> <p>Gerard Nolan, an industry expert in hotel room investment, said: \"They probably paid far too much for the assets they bought and they spent an awful lot of money doing up Nest in Bayswater, going way over budget.\"</p> <p>He added that all hotel groups in London are beginning to feel the impact of the credit crunch. \"Occupancy rates and room rates have been so good for so long, but now it's tailing off. At the end of the day, a hotel room is a luxury spend and all individuals and corporates are cutting back.\"</p> <p>Investors are unlikely to be left with nothing. They will be left holding an asset - a 999-year lease on a hotel room - which will have a value when the administrators find another hotel group willing to buy and finish redeveloping the existing GuestInvest portfolio. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer earlier this year, Sandelson said: \"Everybody seems to love the concept of owning a hotel room.</p> <p>\"It makes good financial sense - investors get good returns and a bit of usage as well as capital growth. So it's a very strong proposition and people seem to warm to it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK's independent climate change committee is expected to recommend next week that the government sets a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, campaigners say.</p> <p>The increase in the target from 60%, hinted at by the prime minister, Gordon Brown, in his party conference speech last month, would bring the UK in line with several other governments including Germany, France and California, although the British target would have the strongest enforcement.</p> <p>The campaign group Friends of the Earth (FoE) said the government will announce whether it will follow the advice of the independent committee of MPs after it publishes its findings on Wednesday. </p> <p>FoE's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"The science could not be clearer. The climate change committee can only come to one possible conclusion - the UK can and must cut its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80% by 2050.<br> \"This is not an issue open for debate or political horse trading - the government must make this commitment to avoid catastrophic climate change.  \"The debate will not be over on Wednesday. The government has yet to explain its decision to leave emissions from planes and ships out of the climate change law \u2013 but the public won't be fooled. \"Hundreds of thousands of people have demanded a strong law that covers all the UK's emissions - they expect their MPs and this Government to deliver.\"</p> <p>Some critics have dismissed the notion of higher targets when they claim government is doing too little to make even lower cuts at present. </p> <p>The announcement will also be closely scrutinised to see whether the government will accept emissions from the aviation and shipping industries as part of the target.</p> <p>But Martyn Williams, climate change campaigner for FoE, said the higher ambition would be likely to lead to tougher interim targets, including 2020.</p> <p>\"It's like me saying I'm [going] for a meeting and I'll try to get there for 10.30 or 11.30; I might be 10 minutes late for either but I'll be there earlier if I aim for 10.30,\" added Williams, who helped lead a major FoE campaign for the climate change bill which introduced the landmark targets.</p> <p>The United Nations' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> has recommended a 50% cut in global emissions by the middle of the century, including reductions of 80-95% by the richest and most polluting nations, including the UK.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Met Office Hadley Centre <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/01/climatechange.carbonemissions1\">warned</a> global emissions must peak in two years in order to reach the 50% target and avoid the greatest risk of runaway climate change.</p>",
  "<p>The first round of media commentary on the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/vice_presidential_debate;_ylt=AgPMWUTlBrqn6BDWMHat8bas0NUE\">vice-presidential debate</a> is in. And it looks like the Obama-Biden ticket has survived what was potentially the most treacherous moment of the campaign.</p> <p>Following Sarah Palin's disastrous interviews with <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=5782924&amp;page=1\">Charles Gibson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/24/eveningnews/main4476173.shtml\">Katie Couric</a>, there was a real danger she'd be declared the winner of last night's encounter with Joe Biden if she could somehow manage to stand upright and keep talking. All of a sudden it would be Palinmania, round two.</p> <p>That didn't happen. Though Palin is receiving deservedly high marks for her folksy, feisty performance, the substance-free nature of her answers has not gone unnoticed by either the press or the public.</p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable piece of opinionating today comes from the right. In her Wall Street Journal column, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122300786229301597.html\">Peggy Noonan</a>, former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and for George Bush's father, weighs in with admiration for Palin's performance skills and contempt for the emptiness behind them.</p> <p>Last month, as you may recall, an open microphone caught Noonan referring to the Palin pick as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/03/peggy-noonan-mike-murphy_n_123647.html\">\"political bullshit\"</a>. Noonan attempted then to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122044753790594947.html?mod=todays_columnists\">deny the obvious meaning</a> of those words, but today she makes it clear that she meant what she said.</p> <p>\"There were moments when she seemed to be doing an infomercial pitch for charm in politics. But it was an effective infomercial,\" writes Noonan, adding: \"A question is at what point shiny, happy populism becomes cheerful manipulation.\" Noonan also lambastes the McCain campaign's \"obnoxious political game\" of pretending that criticism of Palin amounts to \"knocking the real America\".</p> <p>Other conservative commentators are more kind to Palin, but they want us to know they can see and hear, too. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/642oflyc.asp\">Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard pronounces Palin the winner</a>, but then goes on to observe that she was \"utterly incoherent\" at times and \"seemed to settle back on material that she seemed to have memorised.\"</p> <p>So how did she win? \"She won,\" Hayes says, \"because to a vast majority of those who watched the debate tonight she likely came off as a plausible vice-president. And that was all that mattered.\" In other words, Hayes thinks she lost, but condescendingly assumes the rubes will come to a different conclusion.</p> <p>Paul Mirengoff, writing for the conservative <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/10/021672.php\">Power Line blog</a>, tells us: \"Palin, forced by circumstances to prove her merit to an increasingly sceptical electorate, accomplished that mission and then some.\" But he can't leave well enough alone, adding: \"From a technical standpoint, it was Biden who had the more detailed command of the facts (and the greater ability to fudge them). He was able not just to hammer McCain, but to do so at a level of specificity that Palin could not address.\"</p> <p>Perhaps bolstered by snap <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/03/politics/2008debates/main4497138.shtml\">CBS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/03/debate.poll/index.html\">CNN</a> polls that show viewers thought Biden won by a wide margin, many mainstream and liberal commentators are coming out of their defensive crouch today. If Republicans want to accuse them of liberal bias, they seem to be saying, so be it.</p> <p>Washington Post columnist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204250.html?hpid=topnews\">Dana Milbank is especially brutal</a>, writing that Palin made it through the debate \"with an unnerving mixture of platitudes and cute, folksy phrases that poured from her lips even when they bore no relation to the questions asked.\"</p> <p>At the Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14235.html\">John Harris and Mike Allen's verdict</a> is that \"she got out alive, though there were white-knuckle moments along the way: questions that were answered with painfully obvious talking points that betrayed scant knowledge of the issue at hand.\" Just in case you missed the point, they add: \"It is hard to count any objective measures by which Biden did not clearly win the encounter.\"</p> <p>At the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/us/politics/03assess.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">Adam Nagourney begins more mildly</a>, telling us that Palin managed to meet the ridiculously low expectations that had been set for her performance: \"Sarah Palin made it through the vice-presidential debate on Thursday without doing any obvious damage to the Republican presidential ticket.\"</p> <p>That may be the best outcome the McCain campaign could have hoped for. Palin was good enough that her presence on the ticket, as <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2201336/\">John Dickerson of Slate argues</a>, should become less of a burning issue than it was in the immediate aftermath of her inability to identify any newspapers she reads, any supreme court decisions disagrees with (other than <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=113\">Roe v Wade</a>) or any measures her running mate has undertaken over the years to reform the imploding financial system.<br> So it's back to Barack Obama versus John McCain, with their running mates fading into their traditional supporting roles. That hasn't been working so well for McCain in recent weeks, but at least it's a dynamic over which he has some control.</p> <p>Palin's erratic but energetic performance may end the recent run of bad news for the Republican ticket. But it's not going to accomplish anything more than that.</p>",
  "<p>William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, today claimed that the appointment of Peter Mandelson was said a \"stunning failure of judgment\" by Brown.</p> <p>\"In bringing back Peter Mandelson - the man who created Labour spin - he has broken his promise to govern in an honest and open way,\" he said.</p> <p>\"You can only conclude that his appointment was designed to distract from the changes he should have made.</p> <p>\"By leaving in place a chancellor who has failed and a foreign secretary who has undermined him at every opportunity, Gordon Brown has also been exposed as weak.</p> <p>\"With this bizarre reshuffle the prime minister has achieved the impossible and made the government even more dysfunctional.\"</p> <p>But other reaction to Mandelson's appointment was more mixed.</p> <h2>Labour</h2> <p>Ex-Labour MP Tam Dalyell, the former father of the Commons, said: \"I am absolutely delighted. Peter Mandelson was a very effective cabinet minister, both in Northern Ireland and other portfolios. On top of that, he has unique experience in Europe and I think this is a superb appointment. I am 100% delighted.</p> <p>\"I have this volcanic reaction partly because he knows a heck of a lot about it and partly because he will carry great weight with the prime minister. All the old baggage is past history.\"</p> <p>But Peter Kilfoye, the Labour former minister, said: \"I fully support the principle of reshuffling cabinet in order to make it better prepared to meet the needs of the forthcoming election.</p> <p>\"However, I believe that the recall of twice-disgraced former MP Peter Mandelson is a thoroughly retrograde step which will do nothing to promote unity within the Labour party.</p> <p>\"On the contrary, the appointment is highly divisive, and he remains a highly divisive figure within the Labour movement.\"</p> <p>John McDonnell, the Labour leftwinger who ran for leader last year, said he was \"absolutely gobsmacked\" at Mandelson's return to the cabinet, adding: \"The whole Labour movement will be utterly perplexed at what the prime minister's motives are.</p> <p>\"This is an extraordinary step backwards into the worst elements of the Blair era, to reinstate possibly the most divisive figure in Labour's recent history.\"</p> <p>But David Blunkett, the former home secretary, who also quit the government twice, described Mandelson's appointment as a \"masterstroke\".</p> <p>He told Sky News: \"It is a masterstroke in the sense that Peter was an excellent secretary of state for trade and industry but more importantly the connections he has built up as trade commissioner in Europe will be invaluable to the UK.</p> <p>\"Of course it is a political stroke as well because it is inclusive and brings back someone who could be described as nothing else but an arch-Blairite.\"</p> <h2>Unions</h2> <p>The Communication Workers' Union said Mandelson was an experienced politician who had steered through legislation on the postal industry during his previous time at the Department for Trade and Industry Department.</p> <p>\"He again faces many big challenges and we look forward to working with him,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Several union officials asked for their reaction said they \"too shocked\" to comment.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Business groups welcomed Mandelson's appointment.</p> <p>John Cridland, the deputy director-general of the CBI, said: \"John Hutton has succeeded in giving the new Department for Business a sense of mission and drive that was lacking at its predecessor, the DTI. In particular, he has taken decisive action to try to deliver energy security of supply in the future.</p> <p>\"The Department for Business must have a heavyweight political big hitter at the cabinet table, and we are encouraged that Peter Mandelson is returning to this role.\"</p> <p>John Wright, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"This shock return is no surprise to us, given Mr Mandelson's previous tenure at the DTI and his current position as Britain's European commissioner for trade.</p> <p>\"Mr Mandelson's experience will mean that he can do away with the probationary period and get straight into the business of dealing with the current credit crunch.</p> <p>\"We will be seeking an early meeting with him in order to convey some very easy-to-implement measures to safeguard the future of small businesses during these difficult times.\"</p> <p>Martin Temple, the chairman of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said: \"John Hutton was a good advocate fighting for business across Whitehall and it was important that they replaced him with a big hitter - which Mr Mandelson certainly is.</p> <p>\"His experience as EU trade commissioner, and having previously been at the old DTI, should be invaluable in ensuring that business continues to have a strong voice at the cabinet table.\"</p> <p>David Frost, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Peter Mandelson did a good job at the DTI and clearly understands business.</p> <p>\"His work in Europe and involvement in global trade discussions also mean that he knows where the UK fits within the international context. We look forward to working with him in these challenging economic times.\"</p> <h2>Liberal Democrats</h2> <p>Danny Alexander, Lib Dem leadr Nick Clegg's chief of staff, said: \"Gordon Brown is deluded if he thinks that Peter Mandelson can help him convince the British people that his party still has what it takes to govern this country.</p> <p>\"Resurrecting ex-ministers from the political graveyard is not going to breathe new life into Gordon Brown's zombie government.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker (Lewes) said: \"It is astonishing to see Peter Mandelson back in government yet again. It seems no matter how many times he is wrapped in chains and thrown to the bottom of the Volga, up he pops again.</p> <p>\"True to form, he is attempting to gain power again and, this time, without any accountability to the electorate.</p> <p>\"As a member of the House of Lords, he will not be subject to the usual scrutiny in the House of Commons at question time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every school child in Scotland aged between 5 and 8 will be given a free lunch each day in an attempt to improve the nation's poor diet and health.</p> <p>The initiative was announced by the Scottish education minister Fiona Hyslop yesterday after a series of pilot projects in primary schools found that the take-up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/schoolmeals/\">school meals</a> increased by up to 32% when they were free.</p> <p>Ministers estimate the programme, which will be underpinned by new legislation, will cost Scotland's 32 local councils about \u00a330m to implement, but they faced criticism from opposition parties for failing to give councils extra money to fund the initiative.</p> <p>Labour MSPs claimed it was an \"election bribe without the cash\" because Hyslop unveiled the initiative in Fife, where the SNP and Labour are locked in a battle to win the Glenrothes byelection, expected to take place on November 6.</p> <p>Labour MSPs in Fife have formally protested to the head of the Scottish civil service, claiming that ministers broke parliamentary protocol by failing to give them advance notice of Ms Hyslop's visit to their area.</p> <p>The new programme, which is due to begin in August 2010 for all children in primary 1, 2 and 3, was welcomed by Cosla, the Scottish local government association. It rejected Labour's claims it was unfunded and said all Scotland's councils had agreed to fund the project in a local government funding settlement earlier this year.</p> <p>A Cosla spokesman said: \"Local authorities will be in the front line to ensure successful delivery of these important Concordat commitments which will have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of our children.\"</p> <p>However, that claim was challenged by senior councillors from Inverclyde, Angus, Highland, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire, who said it was \"extremely difficult\" to pay for. </p> <p>Stephen McCabe, leader of Inverclyde council, said: \"Local authorities across the country are facing severe financial pressures due to rising costs and the impact of the current global credit crunch. </p> <p>\"Unless the Scottish government provides additional funding it is simply a fact of life that other council services will have to be cut to pay for this policy.''</p> <p>Jim Logue, education convenor for North Lanarkshire council, said it would cost his authority \u00a31m to fund, leading to cuts in other services. \"We may have to consider axing its breakfast clubs to pay for the SNP's policy. This will deny some of the poorest children in North Lanarkshire access to the most important meal of the day. </p> <p>\"I am calling on the Scottish government to meet the full cost of this policy if they want to see it delivered. It's simply not good enough to put the burden on local government.\"</p> <p>The pilots involved 35,000 children in West Dunbartonshire, the Borders, Fife, Glasgow and East Ayrshire. The average take-up of the school meals for children not already registered for free meals increased from 41% to 69%. The price per meal was as high as \u00a34.65 a head in the Borders.</p> <p>With Scotland facing rising obesity and deep-seated problems with diet-related diseases, the programme is intended to ensure children are given nutritious and varied diets, with a greater proportion of freshly cooked foods, fruit and vegetables. </p> <p>The Scottish Tories' shadow minister for children, Liz Smith, said it was still unclear whether the most at-risk children would benefit and said councils were under intense financial pressure \u2013 raising further doubts about how successful the programme would be. </p>",
  "<p>Is there anything duller than a Man Utd/Liverpool/Chelsea/Arsenal \"fan\" \u2013 who invariably has been to one, maybe two live games at best \u2013 telling you how much they care about \"their\" team. Yawn. These people would have always bought FIFA over Pro Evolution Soccer. Generalisation? Sure, but you get the point. PES was always the game for real fans of real teams, not just the Sky/100k-a-week/Prem only mainstream. But things might, just might, have changed. This year's FIFA is a bit of a revelation. </p> <p>Ok, I've only had code for a couple of days but so far so good. Off the pitch there are host of new features that show promise. I signed up to the <a href=\"http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/08/21/fifa-09-adidas-live-season-takes-real-life-stats-brings-them-into-the-game/\">Live Season</a> service - one league is free - which supposedly adds real life current form data into the game. It's too early to really tell if it makes a difference but Spurs and Newcastle both lost the games I played so maybe there is something to it. General online play is pretty much lag free too \u2013 a joy compared to the laggy mess of PES online. The new 10 vs 10 online *sounds* fantastic but I've yet to find enough players to test it. This shouldn't be a problem from today so fingers crossed. </p> <p>But FIFA has never had a problem with matters off field. It's the on pitch stuff that needed fixing. The good news then is that FIFA '09 is the closest one yet to replicating the fluid action seen in PES. It's not quite there yet \u2013 the players still don't feel *quite* as responsive as they do in PES \u2013 but the difference is far less marked than before. And when it comes to heading FIFA wins out, with players having much more control on where they place their header. I scored a fantastic glancing header last night against Portsmouth. Ok, it may have been a consolation for the Southampton but it felt like a winner. </p> <p>The game looks the part too \u2013 with players pointing where they want the pass and the bigger players running in the style of their real-life counterparts. Up close though the players still look like freakish zombies. And get out of the top leagues and likenesses go out the window. Yes, I'm sure most punters won't care that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/30/championship.southampton\">Adam Lallana</a> looks nothing like he does in real life but when you have the correct kit, team and player names it does annoy. Maybe this will be sorted by FIFA 2019?</p> <p>But don't go thinking your PES/FIFA decision is a no-brainer. After a relatively disappointing \u2013 but still highly playable \u2013 couple of PES releases, 2009 is threatening to be a return to form. From what I've played \u2013 the demo is out now \u2013 the game feels slightly slower than last year, which has to be a good thing. Defending seems easier and more effective now, which comes as a relief after the goalfest that was 2008. Final PES code should be out soon \u2013 the game is released in a fortnight \u2013 so judgement will have to wait. But it's going to be a tough call. FIFA or PES then \u2013 which team are you supporting this year?</p>",
  "<p>The London mayor, Boris Johnson, defended his decision to remove the Met police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, after accusations that his motives were political.</p> <p>Johnson said there had been no \"party political plot\" and stressed he had consulted widely before asking Blair to stand down.</p> <p>His comments came after the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, reacted angrily to the way Blair's resignation was handled. She accused the Conservative mayor of acting without authority or respect by pushing Blair out for political reasons.</p> <p>But speaking at City Hall today, Johnson said no constitutional precedent was set by apparently undermining her prerogative to appoint or dismiss the head of Scotland Yard.</p> <p>\"I think some of the analysis I have read this morning has been absolutely outlandish. There is not and has not been any kind of party political plot by the agents of the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems. There is no party political element to this,\" said Johnson.</p> <p>He added: \"I simply thought after long reflection and widespread consultation that it was a good opportunity for someone else to offer new leadership, stability and increased operational effectiveness.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, a leaked email passed to The Guardian reveals that Johnson appears to have backed down in his threat not to appoint a permanent successor to Blair.</p> <p>The Tory mayor told the commissioner on Wednesday that his post would only be filled on a full time basis when the Conservatives might have the opportunity to be in government, which could be over 18 months away.</p> <p>But this afternoon Johnson sent an email to members of the Metropolitan Police Authority in which he talked of \"preparations for appointing a successor\".</p> <p>In the email, Johnson said he was aware of the limits on his powers as the chair of the MPA.</p> <p>In the email Johnson also acknowledges the Met faces a \"disruptive\" period following Johnson's ousting of the commissioner.</p> <p>Johnson wrote: \"There has been a great deal of speculation in the press about my role in his reaching his decision to announce that he will leave on December 1. It would be wrong, and unfair to Sir Ian, to go into any detail about the content of the conversation I had with him.</p> <p>\"Let me reassure you, though, that I was fully aware of the extent and limitations of my powers as chair of the MPA and the role that the authority, as a corporate whole, has to play in the appointment of the commissioner and other ACPO officers.</p> <p>\"The conversation was on a one to one basis and the decision that Sir Ian took was his decision alone. </p> <p>\"That said, we clearly, as an authority, have a responsibility to support the senior management of the MPS through the disruptive few weeks that will follow the announcement and the preparations for appointing a successor.\"</p> <p>Blair quit the most senior police post in the country yesterday, claiming he could not continue without the support of the mayor, who used his first day as MPA chairman on Wednesday to demand his resignation.</p> <p>Ken Jones, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, told the programme he was concerned about the politicisation of the police.</p> <p>\"We do need to avoid the politicisation, even by implication, that we see in some American forces where law and order and politics are bound together in a toxic way. We can't ever get to a position in this country where that happens,\" said Jones.</p> <p>The home secretary made clear her anger over Johnson's failure to \"respect\" the process for appointing and dismissing Met police commissioners.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC1's Question Time last night, Smith said: \"What is important when you are both choosing and when you're supporting somebody that you're asking to do a job like that is that you keep party politics out of it. You need to work alongside people and, frankly, you should put some time and effort into that.</p> <p>\"The mayor said on the first day in his job he didn't feel he had confidence in Sir Ian and that's why he took the decision to resign.\"</p>",

  "<p>Zimbabwe once again attracted remarkable international attention in 2008, this time over highly controversial elections and protracted negotiations between Zimbabwe's main political actors aimed at finding a resolution to the country's political crisis. A Thabo Mbeki brokered power-sharing deal between Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF and the two MDC factions, led by Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara respectively, was finally reached on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/sep/15/zimbabwe\">September 15 2008</a>. Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders celebrated. The international community's response was lukewarm. The likes of Mbeki felt vindicated after years of bearing criticism for his \"quiet diplomacy\". Others, such as hardliners in Zanu-PF and Zimbabwe's security establishment, were disgruntled.</p> <p>For many Zimbabweans inside the country, the deal was a ray of hope because life had become a punishing drudgery. A life of enduring the merciless African sun while queuing for food and a worthless national currency. The wretchedness is compounded by the breakdown of service delivery, skyrocketing inflation, the breakdown of the rule of law, the politicisation of the police, military, civil service and judiciary, and the violence meted out by the state on citizens it ought to protect.</p> <p>In the midst of evident collapse and misery one would have thought that the power-sharing deal will be implemented with alacrity by the three political parties. But Zimbabwe is a difficult country politically. It has a penchant for throwing up the unexpected and many of its current problems have robust historical roots that will not be easily uprooted. It is little surprise that a deadlock has developed between the political parties over the formation of a cabinet to run the country. Zanu-PF is bent on retaining powerful ministerial posts such as state security, defence, home affairs and finance. In spite of the MDC's majority in parliament and Tsvangirai amassing the most votes in the first presidential election round, Zanu-PF still views the MDC as a subordinate party.</p> <p>The Tsvangirai MDC has called on former South African President, Thabo Mbeki, to <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20080922055702968C646034\">continue with his mediation efforts</a> in order to break the deadlock. On the other hand Zanu-PF insists that Mbeki's mediation is not required because there is no deadlock. The contestation over Mbeki's renewed involvement in Zimbabwe is odd. Mbeki is still recovering from the fallout of his humiliating <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i6s82xb7yzOZij2i5fT_xwptVzhg\">resignation</a> as South African president. Whether he still has the verve and authority to continue as mediator is unclear. The new South African president Kgalema Motlanthe has been quick to throw his weight behind Mbeki's proposed continued mediation. Whether this is a reflection of his faith in Mbeki's negotiation skills or is an attempt to duck having to deal with a difficult situation that may haunt his presidency in the manner it did Mbeki's is also unclear.</p> <p>However, the issue is less about whether Mbeki should continue in his role and the various motives at play. Mbeki's efforts reached their peak when the power-sharing deal was signed. There is little he or any other mediator can add to the actual power-sharing process. The onus is on Zimbabwean politicians, particularly those in Zanu-PF, to show political maturity and commitment to the deal for the sake of national interest, and to foster trust and unity between each other and the nation. These qualities are rare in Zimbabwean political culture because in the place of civil dialogue there is uncivil dialogue. In the place of meritocracy there is seniority. In the place of a culture of conflict resolution there are \"degrees in violence\" guaranteeing particular political interests. In the place of issue-based politics there is labelling based on the extent of one's liberation war credentials. Being the dominant nationalist party for approximately 40 years, Zanu-PF is guilty of having generated this political culture.</p> <p>The result is that Zimbabwean politics has been rendered exclusive and impenetrable to those who seek to challenge the views of Zanu-PF. The party is the be all and end all and those outside of it are illegitimate. As former vice-president Simon Muzenda once noted, \"If Zanu-PF puts up a baboon as a candidate, you vote for the baboon.\" Other leading Zanu-PF politicians such as Nathan Shamuyarira boast unselfconsciously that \"the area of violence is an area where Zanu-PF has a very strong, long and successful history\". And while individuals associated with the MDC have attempted to develop reasoned and democratic politics, both MDCs are susceptible to a politics akin to Zanu-PF's. Opposition politics is also a habitat for violence and undemocratic practices. It too is characterised by personalised and immature politics, and contemptible invective such as the Tsvangirai MDC secretary general Tendai Biti's public branding of rival MDC member Gift Chimanikire as a \"smelly fat man who does not bath\" and Chimanikire's retort that Biti \"suffered from diarrhoea\".</p> <p>A melancholy truth about Zimbabwean politics is its lack of gravitas. It is rudimentary, trifling, divisive, intolerant and blind to the national interest \u2013 this is the crux of the matter, not whether Mbeki should stay on as mediator and be called in.</p>",

  "<p>A year ago Geoff Hoon emerged as one of the unlikely cabinet survivors of the Blair-Brown era, moving from his position as Europe minister to that of chief whip.</p> <p>Twelve months on he has been moved again, staying in the cabinet but in the less central job of transport secretary. He has had a difficult time as chief whip, partly because Nick Brown, his deputy, is close to the prime minister and the acolytes that supported Gordon Brown for years as chancellor. </p> <p>Nicknamed \"Buff-Hoon\" for his unfortunate choice of footwear while visiting troops as defence secretary under Tony Blair, the cabinet minister has made his fair share of gaffes.</p> <p>He recently brought embarrassment on the government when, as chief whip, he sent a note to Keith Vaz thanking him for his help on the crunch vote on 42-day detention and saying he trusted he would be \"appropriately rewarded\".</p> <p>The matter was later dismissed as a \"light-hearted, jokey remark\".</p> <p>However, tipped as the \"sacrificial lamb\" during the Hutton inquiry into the death of government scientist David Kelly - due to his role as defence secretary at the time of the war and stiff performance during the investigation - Hoon in fact emerged unscathed, not leaving defence until after the 2005 election, and only then for the job of leader of the Commons.</p> <p>His manner is dry to the point of dullness, but as secretary of state for defence for six years he oversaw Britain's involvement in some of its most controversial conflicts - Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001 and, of course, Iraq in 2003.</p> <p>But under the lawyerly exterior (he is, in fact, a Cambridge-educated lawyer, and former law lecturer at the University of Leeds) lurks a man with a passion for, and encyclopaedic knowledge of, 1960s rock music.</p> <p>Indeed, it may surprise many of his anti-war critics to know that his favourite album of all time is by peacenik Bob Dylan. He's also a keen Derby County fan, and prefers his Ashfield constituency and young family to the lures of London.</p> <p>Hoon spent 10 years in Brussels before entering parliament, as an MEP for the Derbyshire and Ashfield constituency, which covers his current Westminster constituency.</p> <p>Elected in 1992 against the tide of Labour's failure to win the general election, he became first a whip, then trade and industry spokesman in opposition, and with Labour in government moved swiftly up the ranks under Blair from a junior post in the lord chancellor's department to minister of state in the Foreign Office, to, in 1999, defence secretary.</p> <p>In fact, as evidence at the Hutton inquiry showed, the Iraq decision was largely taken in Downing Street, sidelining the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence. But Hoon was partly responsible for the controversial \"naming strategy\" which outed Kelly to the press.</p> <p>However, he survived a further two years in defence, before Blair made him leader of the Commons after the 2005 general election - still a major posting, with Labour's majority cut by more than 100.</p> <p>But the 2006 reshuffle saw him demoted to Europe minister, and out of the cabinet - payback, the Westminster rumour mill said, for his secretly switching sides and helping Gordon Brown prepare for government.</p> <p>He replaces Ruth Kelly, who resigned last week to spend more time with her family.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Toronto, Canada. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Benjamin Spurr (vocals, guitar), Ian Fosberry (guitar, keyboards), Jordan Melchiorre (drums), Luke Melchiorre (bass). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> The Coast are a Canadian band who often sound like a British band trying to sound like an American band. Don't get too excited because they're not quite this amazing \u2013 if they were they'd be the best new band of the last five years and we could retire from the proceeds of discovering them \u2013 but they sound a bit like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire\">Arcade Fire</a> pretending to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/neworder\">New Order</a> doing cover versions of Clouds Taste Metallic-era Flaming Lips. Mindblowing, huh? Well, listen up, because there is something seriously promising going on here even if the Coast, who took their name from a Paul Simon song, don't quite seem to have settled on a sound yet. Even though they've been going for a couple of years, they appear to still be casting around for one they can call their own; either that or they're on some diversity trip as a way of putting off the decision. Or they're bold eclectic warriors refusing to be tied down. <br> Yes, let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that. Some of their songs are emo-esque; others approximate the danceable noise of Bloc Party et al. They could almost pass for an emo act at a nu rave: Death Cab for Party, or something. They veer between the anthemic shimmer of stadium rock, a modern kind of psychedelia and art disco, sometimes within a single track. Occasionally, you sense there's a rootsy, ragged bunch of country-rockers struggling to break out - on No Secret Why they sound like the Jayhawks before they became interesting. It could be a mess, but it's not, and when it works and everything comes together, as it does on Tightrope, Nueva York, Ceremony Guns and Killing Off Our Friends, the effect is sublime.  The members' contributions are individually appealing and perfectly suit these songs about death, isolation, disappointment and regret - Spurr's hopelessly frail, forlorn vocals, Fosberry's layered, shoegazey guitars, Luke Melchiorre's dolorous bass and his brother Jordan's tireless rhythms that makes him resemble a drum machine. Together, the band have the vigour and attack of a powerful live unit \u2013 they've spent so long on the road that at home they feel like tourists, hence the title of their debut album, Expatriate - but their music has the subtle nuances and detailed richness of a studio experiment.  Whatever it is they do, it's winning them an audience, among the musical powers that be in the States and among Real People, who don't seem to mind, in fact actively admire, their sonic vacillations. They were recently invited to perform on the Daytrotter Sessions, an influential series of radio sessions in the States, which in the last couple of years has proved instrumental in breaking bands like Vampire Weekend, Fleet Foxes, Cold War Kids, Death Cab for Cutie and Spoon. Success has come at the right time: they needed cheering up after they were robbed recently, although the thieves only took their clothes (and if you've seen their clothes you might wonder why). And Spurr needed an excuse to give up his day job in the Toronto office of a non-profit organisation that promotes breastfeeding. Now he just needs an excuse to come to central London so he can deck us for bringing that little nugget of information up. <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Canada's best-kept secret.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Ditch the country inflections and you've got some superlative, lush emo-rock. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Give emo a good name.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Give emus a good name. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Their debut EP is released by Aporia on October 13, with their debut album Expatriate to follow in February 2009.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Flaming Lips, Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, New Order. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thecoastmusic\">www.myspace.com/thecoastmusic</a> <br> <strong><br>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Envy.<br> </p>",
  "<p>It's a tale of decline and fall that would make Evelyn Waugh jealous. In 2003 Southampton were in the FA Cup final \u2013 a horribly one-sided final in favour of Arsenal, but a final nonetheless \u2013 and finished eighth in the Premier League, their best ever placing. A little over five years later they're nestled in the less glitzy end of the Championship.</p> <p>If it's any consolation for Saints fans, their descent \u2013 they were relegated in 2004-05 - has been a fairly lively one. Nearly 80 players and a fair few managers have passed through the club since 2003, while the combination of Harry Redknapp's old school values and Sir Clive Woodward's experimentation had the jarring intrigue of a Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster directed by Lars von Trier.</p> <p>Once George Burley took sole control of the club at the beginning of the 2006/07 season \u2013 Woodward had still been buzzing around at the beginning of his tenure - it looked like the club's fortunes might be on the up, crucially given that the club had plenty of highly-paid players and it was the last year of parachute payments. That year the team scored ridiculous amounts of goals, but conceded too many and eventually lost to Derby in the play-offs.</p> <p>It's said that the key to success in the Championship is consistency and Saints still conceded goals with admirable ease last season. Unfortunately they stopped scoring them and it took a win on the final day of the season to stay up. While that secured the club's short-term future, the long-term was more threatening. In an attempt to get back to the Premier League Southampton's wage bill had risen to \u00a310.5m but their income had slumped from \u00a350m to \u00a313m and there's the small matter of the \u00a320m mortgage they have on St Mary's.</p> <p>The situation was bad enough this summer that Rupert Lowe, the man many fans blame for overextending the club in the first place, was able to return as co-chairman without being lynched. </p> <p>Whatever you say about Lowe \u2013 and no matter how filthy it is, it's probably already been said on one of the Southampton message-boards \u2013 he's not afraid to try new things. With no money and many experienced players on high wages sold or loaned out to cut costs, the club has had to concentrate on its academy players, a side of the club Lowe has always been keen on developing.</p> <p>The man Lowe has chosen to nurture his young team is <a href=\"http://m6live.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/saints/news/3653095.Remarkable_story_of_Jan_Poortvliet/\">Jan Poortvliet</a>, carpenter, football purist and World Cup finalist with Holland in 1978. \"Poortvliet wants the team to play total football from the under-18s upwards,\" explains Chris Colby of <a href=\"http://www.southampton-mad.co.uk/\">southampton-mad.co.uk</a>. \"The official line is 4-2-1-2-1. Essentially it's a striker, one in the hole, two attacking wide men and two holding midfielders.\" </p> <p>Of course, it's all very well playing total football when you have Johnny Rep and Johan Neeskens in your side, it's a tad trickier when your team-sheet has more 90s references than a Britpop revival night \u2013 eight of the starting XI against Norwich were under 20 - and Saints struggled early on in the season. Even then though, the team enjoyed spells of enthralling football and a new-found grit to go with the verve that has seen Saints win their last two league games. Particularly outstanding have been England Under-21 player Adam Lallana and David McGoldrick. Poortvliet has proven to be a canny businessman too, loaning out the highly-paid Nathan Dyer to Sheffield United in return for Jordan Robertson, who scored a spectacular goal during this week's win over Norwich.</p> <p>Poortvliet is confident his team can reach the play-offs - and it would be brilliant to see a young, attractive team do well - but he may not be able to hold on to his team. Debt looms over the club, while the stadium has been half-empty more than once this season. The resulting fall in income means that the very players who can get the club back to a stage where it can earn good money again may have to be sold. \"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that at some stage in the future we will be required to dispose of some of our better young players in order for the club to satisfy its banking covenants,\" co-chairman Michael Wilde recently told the Southern Daily Echo.</p> <p>Of course, selling players may merely hold off the financial problems rather than solve them: the club has sold \u00a330m of talent since 2003, including Theo Walcott and Gareth Bale, but the financial troubles still remain. Like many clubs in these troubled economic times, Saints will have to hold on and hope for the best.</p>",
  "<p>In my second year of teaching at a tough inner city comprehensive in the early 1990s, I occasionally used to grab my insolent pupils by the arm and fling them out of the classroom \u2013 if they were small enough. Once or twice, I gave the really troublesome boys a light clip over the back of the head. Although <a href=\"http://www.archivist.f2s.com/cpa/mainpage.htm\">corporal punishment</a> was illegal by then, many other teachers there, still not fully cognisant with the law, did the same and far worse; once I saw a teacher grab and kick a pupil when he was lying on the ground. Nothing was done; it was all swept under the carpet. In the absence of any proper management to enforce strict discipline, chaos ruled in the school except in the classrooms where you were really macho and hard. What we weren't aware of was that the very machismo behaviour that temporarily made pupils behave was, in fact, leading to far worse problems throughout the school; it sanctioned all sorts of violent behaviour among the kids. If the teachers were biffing people, why couldn't the kids?</p> <p>I became a \"controloholic\"; a teacher addicted to controlling the behaviour of my pupils. I found that asking pupils to read in silence and threatening to chuck them out if they played up worked well; most of my classes in my second year were very well behaved, compared with the extremely unruly ones I had endured in my first year. However, looking back I am not sure that they learned much, except that they should obey. One of the major shortcomings of my lessons was that no discussion, group work or imaginative activities were permitted because that would possibly sanction chaos to ensue. In short, I wasn't teaching, I was child-minding in a particularly uninspiring fashion.</p> <p>I came unstuck when I grabbed a pupil by the arms when he disobeyed me, refusing to play Macbeth in a shortened version of the play. He ran out of the classroom and complained to the deputy head, who reprimanded me and warned me never to do it again. Which I haven't. That was more than 15 years ago and my attitudes towards corporal punishment have changed hugely since then. I no longer believe in it; I have seen first hand how it just doesn't work. Once you feel you have the sanction of violence at your fingertips, you cease thinking imaginatively, rationally and strategically about solving behavioural problems. Children cease to be people, merely robots to be re-programmed with a boot up the backside. Teaching stops being about relationships and all about obedience.</p> <p>I am not surprised though that one in five teachers wants to bring back the cane. As I have seen myself, firsthand in countless classrooms during my decade and a half as a teacher in state schools, many British children are out of control, unwilling to listen, eager to answer back, and reluctant to work on anything that doesn't stimulate their interest immediately. A <a href=\"http://www.teachers/tv/system/files/behaviour_survey.doc\">recent government survey</a> revealed that 60% of front-line teachers feel there is a discipline crisis in our classrooms. Bringing back the cane seems like it might be the only solution in the face of this desperate situation.</p> <p>Of course, it isn't. Many of our worst behaved children live in violent households, where they are beaten regularly by their parents. Not surprisingly, angry and disaffected, they bring this violence into the classroom, seeking to solve their problems with their fists and abuse. These vulnerable, sad, defeated children need properly trained teachers to deal with them; I have seen myself that there are strategies that really work such as finding a curriculum that engages them, giving them proper counselling, helping them get motivated in a positive, 'emotionally intelligent' fashion. However, frequently, school far from being a refuge for them is even more of a nightmare; many of these children can't read or write properly and more often than not hate their lessons. The current system is very inflexible and frequently doesn't cater for their needs; school budgets are over-stretched and targeted support doesn't happen. In the cases when it does, such as when <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk\">Save The Children's Ear To Listen project</a> enables children to have an \"advocate\" who mediates between home and school, bringing them the right help and guidance, the results are remarkable; the poor behaviour stops and they start to learn. </p> <p>I went back a few days ago to the old school where I used to be such a \"controloholic\" and was amazed to see how much it had changed; the children were better behaved than in most suburban comprehensives, the results were through the roof and everyone appeared happy. The headteacher, who joined the school after I left, had instituted some simple, consistent policies which really bore fruit: engaging lessons for troubled children, clear rules and regulations, targeted support for those who were struggling, and a sense of pride in the school. He didn't need the cane to do that, he just needed some good, informed teachers, a lot of hard work, resources and common sense. Bringing back the cane would be an unmitigated disaster for our schools; we need to use our intellects to make our children motivated to learn, not our fists.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.francisgilbert.co.uk\">Francis Gilbert</a>'s Parent Power \u2013 The Guide To Getting The Best Education For Your Child is published by <a href=\"http://www.piatkus.co.uk/home\">Piatkus.</a></em></p>",

(Yes, all right, Boot Camp for Web Services.)</p> <p>(If you want to vote now, head right on over to <a href=\"http://suabw.uservoice.com/\">http://suabw.uservoice.com</a>, where you'll find the full \u2013 well, apart from a few stragglers which you'll find at the <a href=\"http://showusabetterway.com/\">SUABW</a> site.)</p> <p>And the connection with local councils? Because as I worked through the entries, trying to format them for the slightly pernickety uploading services at <a href=\"http://www.uservoice.com\">Uservoice</a> (which otherwise provides a great, free service for user-generated feedback), I noticed that lots of the entries seemed to be coming from people who wanted better access to what their councils are doing.</p> <p>A quick recap. Show Us A Better Way is a competition with a \u00a320,000 prize where entries are intended to suggest innovative and useful web service applications for the mass of government-held data (both central and local). The prize will be used to set up the service; the efforts of Tom Watson, the Cabinet Office minister (at least, pending the reshuffle), were key in making it happen. And he pushed it through because he finds the arguments of the Free Our Data campaign persuasive: that by making government-generated non-personal data available for free re-use, you encourage new businesses and applications - thus generating jobs, and taxes.</p> <p>What's interesting, as I say, is how much people want local information. Completely at random, there's <a href=\"http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/07/youth-space-or.html\">Youth Space</a>, which would be \"An information centre for young people showing local resources for recreation, education, health, employment and generally promoting social cooperation.\" Beside it is <a href=\"http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/07/rate-my-park.html\">Rate My Park</a>, \"A searchable website allowing parents, children and young people to find local recreation areas &amp; share opinions about facilities\". (These links go to the original SUABW site; to find them to vote on, see the full list on Uservoice.) Again and again, what people are asking for is better internet access to things going on around them - schools, nurseries, parks, planning applications, jobs, air quality, the local recycling centre (with webcams!), council tax band calculation, the green-ness of your street; and on and on.</p> <p>It's unsurprising, of course; we all live locally, not nationally, and so it's local things we want to know about. But that is clearly where local councils aren't doing it right.</p> <p>At the very least, this competition could give local government website developers some clear ideas for services to develop. And if that sounds expensive, it has to be cheaper than the alternative \u2013 where people don't recycle enough, where the council has to print thousands and thousands of leaflets that are ignored, where council staff are endlessly answering the phone to the same queries about schools and nurseries.</p> <p>Yes, it will cost councils something to develop those services. But they're the sort of thing that you only have to do once \u2013 and once you have, it gets easier the next time, and the next. That's the sort of way that you get your budgets under control: by not spending money repeating things you don't have to.</p> <p>Noen of this, by the way, should be interpreted as any form of recommendation for or against any of the entries. They're all up for grabs. The question is, which one do you think has the X Factor that means it should go forward to the final judging? Do, please, let us know, by heading over to <a href=\"http://suabw.uservoice.com\">the voting area at uservoice.com</a>, having a <a href=\"http://suabw.uservoice.com/pages/general?all=true\">read of the entries</a>, and casting your vote. If you want, you can roll a pen around your mouth and be rude about the ones you don't like. It's meant to be an enjoyable process, after all.</p>",
  "<p>After almost four weeks of shows, against a backdrop of doomsday-like financial headlines, the burning question from the Paris catwalks is this: just what might we decide to buy next summer when we've cut up our store cards and scraped the bottom of our overdrafts? Well, there is one wardrobe tweak that even the most prudent of shoppers is likely to make. Next summer get ready for the return of the shoulder pad. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338244527\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/02/BalmainShoulders1.jpg\" alt=\"Military jackets wih shoulder pads at Balmain\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Designed for a ramrod straight back.

This show matters because Balmain is currently the name that will earn you maximum fashion points being that it is the label du choix of top editors like Emmanuelle Alt and Carine Roitfeld at Paris Vogue. And there's no question their \"le rock and roll\" insouciant look influences our high street right now. If by March Zara and Topshop aren't crammed with sparkly shoulder-padded jackets and acid-washed skin-tight jeans as a result of this show, then the Eiffel Tower isn't located in Paris.</p> <p>Later in the week we saw big shoulders at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2008/oct/02/paris.fashion.week.givenchy?picture=338190232\">Givenchy</a>, where the pad construction made a chiffon blouse stand visibly clear of the model's shoulder. At <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2008/sep/30/parisfashionweek.catwalk?picture=338122276\">Margiela</a> - where it has been rumoured that this would be the last show from the designer dubbed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/fashion/shows/02MARGIELA.html?ref=style\">The Invisible Man</a> because of his desire to remain anonymous - we saw constructed shoulders too. Granted one of his shoulder padded-looks was made from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2008/sep/30/parisfashionweek.catwalk?picture=338122267\">hairdressers' wigs</a> and probably isn't something to be attempted on civvy street, but this maverick designer has proved over the past twenty years that his ideas are ones to be diluted and copied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338244608\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/02/StellashouldersAFP1.jpg\" alt=\"Padded shoulders at Stella McCartney\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pretty in pink - Stella McCartney shoulders out the rest of the competition.

In her show notes left on the audience's seats (along with collectable tins of retro Fuzzy Felt) Stella made reference to \"defined yet feminine\" shoulders. Pale rose boyfriend jackets worn loosely open with rolled up sleeves made shoulder pads seem so much less scary than they sound. Ditto the evening tux all-in-one with defined shoulders that was the show's closing look.</p> <p>Ironically, the last time fashion made a fuss of shoulder-pads was in the Greed is Good era of the Eighties \u2013 ie the polar opposite of the financial meltdown that's happening right now. So, is this fashion's way of trying to be positive about the future of the worldwide economy? Who knows.</p> <h2><strong>TRENDWATCH</strong></h2> <p>If you thought the shoulder pads thing was bad news, then it's best to look away now, because another Eighties favourite is heading our way: people, prepare for faded denim.

For legal reasons, his plea could not be reported until today.</p> <p>Creighton had previously denied killing the 35-year-old biker but changed his plea ahead of the trial of six other men accused of killing Tobin near junction 12 of the M40 in August last year.</p> <p>Tobin, who lived in Mottingham, south-east London, worked as a mechanic at a Harley Davidson garage.</p> <p>A post-mortem examination found he died from single gunshot wound to the back of his head on the Warwickshire stretch of the motorway, as a he returned from the Bulldog Bash bikers' festival.</p> <p>Creighton, who also admitted two firearms charges, was remanded in custody yesterday and will be sentenced at the end of the trial, which is expected to last for up to six weeks.</p> <p>A jury was sworn in today and is expected to begin hearing evidence in the case next week.</p> <p>Mr Justice Treacy, who lifted a restriction prohibiting the media from reporting Creighton's pleas, warned jurors not to conduct their own investigations into the killing of Tobin.</p> <p>Karl Garside, 45, pleaded not guilty to murder during a previous hearing in February, while Simon Turner, 41, Dane Garside, 42, Malcolm Bull, 53, Dean Taylor, 47, and 46-year-old Ian Cameron entered their not guilty pleas last December.</p> <p>All six men also face a charge of possessing a shotgun, while Turner and Dane Garside are further charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband, the younger brother of the foreign secretary David Miliband, is to lead a newly created department of energy and climate in a move that signals a major rethink of the government's environment policy and reflects the rise of climate change to the top of the national and international environment agendas.</p> <p>With the move of John Hutton, the government's leading advocate of new coal-fired power stations and nuclear power, to the position of defence secretary, the government has paved the way for more integrated energy and environment policy. </p> <p>Industry and environment departments have long been at odds with each other, leading to political embarrassments and charges that different parts of government were pulling in different directions. </p> <p>Government insiders said the department was restructured because of the rising political importance of energy prices and efficiency, the need for one department to take the lead in negotiations for a new international climate treaty next year, and to take lead responsibility for delivering a new emissions reduction target, expected to be announced next week. The new department will have control over nearly two thirds of UK carbon emissions which come from energy for electricity and heat. The remainder is from transport and agriculture.</p> <p>The move was today welcomed by green groups. \"For the last 10 years this government has dithered on climate change, offering us inspiring rhetoric but little in the way of real action. Bringing energy and climate together at last reflects the urgency of the threat we face from climate change,\" said John Sauven, head of Greenpeace. </p> <p>\"Hopefully Ed Miliband will champion efforts to boost renewable energy and energy efficiency, as part of a plan to create the green collar jobs that Britain has so far lost to our European neighbours.\"</p> <p>Other groups were quick to welcome the new department. \"WWF welcomes the government's decision to create a new climate change and energy department - it shows a clear recognition that the UK's chances of hitting its climate targets are inextricably linked to its energy policies,\" said David Norman, head of campaigns at WWF.</p> <p>The first test of Miliband's credibility will be whether he will put a stop to plans for the construction of the UK's first new coal-fired power station in over 30 years at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">Kingsnorth</a> in Kent. This decision has been delayed for months and is proving a deep embarrassment at cabinet level with Ed Miliband's brother, former environment secretary David, arguing that no unabated coal stations should be built. </p> <p>A senior government source played down hopes that the new climate and energy secretary would immediately scrap controversial projects such as Kingsnorth and new nuclear power stations, saying: \"It's not the take over of one by the other, it's really the integration. We still have to keep the lights on [and] we're anxious about the security implications of being very dependent on gas, so these are really hard issues.\"</p> <p>However a source close to Ed Miliband said the two brothers were personally very close: \"They are both intellectual leftists from a tradition of thinking about what it means to be on the left, they are both young and the younger generation tend to see the environment as part of the left. Ed, who's very committed to social justice, will try to find a way of making that part of the environment brief, and want to integrate this issue into Labour thinking and give us definition.\"</p> <p>But Ed Miliband will also have to decide whether to allow department officials to continue lobbying to change the EU's commitment on renewables. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/26/biofuels.climatechange\">Leaked papers</a> show Britain is exerting strong pressure to remove aviation from renewable energy targets.</p> <p>Commentators were today waiting to see how the moves would affect the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which has traditionally led the government on climate change. </p> <p>The independent Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) , which advises government on environment and development, and has often been highly critical of energy policies, said the move was welcome.</p> <p>\"Combining energy and climate change policy under one secretary of state is a welcome move, and one the Sustainable Development Commission has been keen to see for some time. This change will make it far easier to make joined-up decisions in an area which is crucial for the UK and the world,\" said Rebecca Willis, vice-chair, SDC. </p> <p>\"By making the right sustainable energy choices, we can tackle energy security and climate change together, and we look forward to working with Ed Miliband to this happen,\" she said.</p> <p>Business reacted positively: \"Both climate change and energy security are vital national interests that need the government's fullest attention and urgent action. Combining them may help identify both synergies and trade-offs, but we must avoid either one becoming subordinate to the other\", said Neil Bentley, the director of business environment at the CBI.</p> <p>International development groups, now pressing strongly for climate change emissions, struck a note of caution. Liz Gallagher, climate change policy researcher at the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, struck a note of caution: \"Just setting up a department is not enough. People living in poverty in the developing world are being hit first and hardest by climate change. We hope this means the government will put poor people at the centre of UK climate change policy.\"</p> <p>Many renewable energy organisations said that the new department should be a major boost for the sector. \"Miliband faces a critical need to stabilise the conventional energy sector and to address the UK's need for firm electricity capacity, while avoiding dangerous gas dependency. </p> <p>\"Sentimental support for renewables is counterproductive to this need, as well as being, paradoxically, harmful to climate change policy\", said John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation. </p> <p>Lord Stern, who authored the government's major report on the economics of climate change in 2006, welcomed the new department: \"It shows an understanding of the importance of the subject which requires strong focus and organisation. At the same time it will have to be something that cuts across the whole of government because everything is about reducing emissions, and the consequences.\"</p> <p>The reshuffle comes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.ipcc\">campaigners claimed</a> that the government's climate change committee is poised to recommend next week that the government set a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050.</p>",

  "<p>China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, decades earlier than many predicted. Chinese emissions are often viewed as a Chinese production problem, but the role of spiraling consumption in rich nations should not be underestimated. One third of China's territorial emissions come from producing exports.</p> <p>A closer look at China's emissions from 2002\u20132005 shows that half their growth was due to export production. A further third of the growth came from capital investments, with a significant share of this in export industries. Indeed, only 15 per cent of the emissions growth from 2002\u20132005 was due to household and government consumption.</p> <p>By the same argument, emissions in some developed countries have not stabilised if imports are included. In the UK, for example, emissions associated with consumption have increased 18 per cent since 1992 \u2014 even though emissions reported to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have declined.</p> <p><strong>Protectionism is not the answer</strong></p> <p>In many developed countries, industries with vested interests point to China's growing emissions and blame its weak environmental legislation, which they say gives Chinese producers an unfair advantage. These industries argue that they \u2014 and the environment \u2014 need protection in the form of subsidies, free carbon permits or border tax adjustments. They also argue that such protectionist measures will coerce China and other developing countries into taking quantifiable action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions when the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012.</p> <p>But ignoring the developed world's share of responsibility for Chinese emissions could put post-2012 debates on a negative and protectionist footing, with serious consequences for world trade. In the words of Ma Kai, the chairman of China's chief economic planning agency, \"the ramifications of limiting the development of developing countries would be even more serious than those from climate change\".<br><strong><br>Linking climate and trade policies</strong></p> <p>Given the importance of trade to many countries' emissions profiles, one would expect it to be an important part of climate policy. Yet the UNFCCC treats countries' emissions as disconnected units, even though trade creates a strong link between them. A clear first step for policymakers is to ensure that climate and trade policies work together.</p> <p>Emissions from China's export industry need not present a problem to the global trading system \u2014 there will always be emissions associated with producing traded goods. The problem lies in China's less than carbon efficient production systems and electricity generation.</p> <p>Internally, China must ensure that new installations use the latest clean technologies. As China rapidly increases its capacity, there is no reason why it cannot become a world leader in developing and using clean technologies. Using the latest technologies now will greatly reduce mitigation costs later, as will investing in urban planning and infrastructure that moves China away from a fossil-fuelled future.</p> <p>And China's exports are so important to global climate that its international trade should play a key role in post-2012 climate policy. Such policy should take advantage of China's huge production capacity and use it to help solve environmental problems by specialising in the products needed in a low-carbon future.</p> <p>But for China to play an active role in post-2012 climate policy, solutions must come from both inside and outside the country. Rich nations can make a first step by replacing rhetoric with action \u2014 for example, by encouraging China to mass produce cheap wind turbines rather than cheap disposable products. The international community must place strict efficiency standards on the use of products. Encouraging China to focus mass production on clean technologies will drive down production costs and speed up global diffusion of technologies such as low-carbon cars, wind turbines and solar panels.</p> <p><strong>Unforseen opportunities</strong></p> <p>These solutions offer the promise of increased production and trade as an incentive for China to invest in clean technologies. But to continue receiving these benefits, China must agree to use a share of the proceeds to clean up its own economy. Global agreements can monitor the country's progress. In the short-term Chinese emissions will continue to increase, but in this case it will be to climate policy's benefit.</p> <p>Rapidly developing countries have the opportunity to lead the world in a low-carbon future. They are expanding at a rate that allows large-scale installation of and experimentation with tomorrow's technologies. By contrast, rich nations suffer from deep sunk costs and entrenched vested interests. Developing countries have the chance to step forward and revolutionise the world in a way no-one thought possible until now.</p> <p>\u0095 Glen Peters is a senior research fellow at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway</p>",

  "<p>Liam Byrne today got the promotion to the cabinet he hoped for and expected when Gordon Brown became prime minister. Now Byrne is minister for the Cabinet Office, a role it is difficult to make a success of but for which his old career as a management consultant should help him.</p> <p>Long regarded as one of the government's \"rising stars,\" the Labour MP for Hodge Hill was, until today, minister for the West Midlands, as well as borders and immigration minister at the Treasury and the Home Office. His careful handling of controversial issues such as the new rules on citizenship, the drafting of legislation for compulsory ID cards and the creation of the new UK Borders Agency has won him many plaudits. John Reid, the former home secretary, admires him enormously and lobbied for his promotion last year. But with several other ministerial changes in the slimmed-down Home Office, Byrne was required to mind the shop.</p> <p>First promoted to the frontbench as a junior health minister by Tony Blair, Byrne was just 34 when he was elected to parliament in 2004 and landed his first government job nine months later.</p> <p>Byrne was briefly minister of state for police and counter-terrorism before being handed the immigration brief by John Reid, the then-home secretary.<br> Before entering public life, Byrne cofounded his own IT firm, the venture capital backed e-commerce company, eGS Group.</p> <p>He previously worked for multinational consulting firm, Accenture and merchant bankers, NM Rothschild. Between 1996 and 1997 he advised the Labour party on the reorganisation of Millbank and helped lead its national business campaign to woo business leaders.</p> <p>Byrne has written widely about public service reform, economic development, and shared values. </p> <p>Born in Warrington in October 1970, Byrne joined the Labour party when he was 15.</p> <p>He studied politics and modern history at Manchester University and is a fellow of the Social Market Foundation. </p> <p>Byrne now lives in Birmingham with his wife Sarah and three children.</p>",
  "<p>The clash of the running mates was, in the end, a rather cordial affair: Sarah Palin turned on the smiling folksiness, Joe Biden went out of his way to be respectful, and neither candidate left the stage in St Louis, Missouri staggering under the burden of a terrible gaffe. In a debate squarely targeting middle-class voters, Palin stuck relentlessly to her prepared points, often all but ignoring moderator Gwen Ifill's questions, but her performance held together, and she easily met the absurdly low expectations that awaited her. Although she frequently betrayed nerves, rattling through words and ideas at speed, the Republican vice-presidential candidate dealt with the Wall Street meltdown, climate change, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Israel and Darfur with more conviction that she demonstrated in recent, disastrous television interviews, Ewen MacAskill writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">today's Guardian</a>. Palin grew more inflammatory when talk turned from the economy to foreign policy, repeatedly asserting that Biden had supported John McCain's approach to the Iraq war until joining Obama's ticket in order to back a plan that she said would be \"a white flag of surrender in Iraq\". </p> <p>\"She had talking points adequate to fill the 90 seconds on the various topics Ifill tossed her way, and often forced Biden to defend Barack Obama,\" Dana Milbank <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204250.html?hpid=topnews\">writes in the Washington Post</a>. \"On the other hand, it wasn't exactly a confidence-builder. Palin, in her 90 minutes on the stage Thursday night, left the firm impression that she is indeed ready to lead the nation - with an unnerving mixture of platitudes and cute, folksy phrases that poured from her lips even when they bore no relation to the questions asked.\"</p> <p>Biden, for his part, just about kept his loquaciousness in check, called Palin \"governor\", and focused his attacks on McCain, whose claims to \"maverick\" status Biden repeatedly sought to undermine. He remained cool almost all the way through but became emotional when he spoke of being a single father, and the death of his daughter and first wife in a car accident.</p> <p>Snap polls by CBS and CNN awarded the debate by some margin to Biden, but it also seems likely that the McCain campaign, and the Republicans' conservative base, will have been reassured by Palin's non-disastrous performance. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday, the McCain campaign announced that they would be winding down their operations in Michigan, apparently giving up on turning the increasingly blue state red. But the Republican National Committee did announce a record fundraising figure of $66m for the month of September - resources that can be used to help garner support for McCain across the country, even though his decision to accept public financing limits the amounts his campaign can raise and spend directly.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Expect the post-debate spin to continue, while Obama campaigns in Pennsylvania, McCain in Colorado, and Palin in Texas. Meanwhile, of course, the historic financial crisis continues: the latest rumours from Capitol Hill last night were that there still weren't enough votes guaranteed for the revised bailout plan to be passed by the House of Representatives. So the cajoling will continue. The vote was due to be held today, but House leaders said they'd postpone it if necessary.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>The latest tracking polls are essentially unchanged: Obama leads in Gallup's poll, 48% to 43%, and in Rasmussen's by 51% to 44%; in both cases, McCain lost one point on the previous day. Meanwhile, a (pre-debate) Washington Post/ABC poll found that Sarah Palin might be becoming far less of a positive force for the McCain campaign: six in 10 voters think she lacks the experience to be an effective president, and a third are now less likely to vote for McCain because of her.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, 'How are you feeling about the economy?' And I'll betcha you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. 'Did we just take a major hit with those investments?'\" - early in last night's debate, Sarah Palin makes clear her intention to argue from the perspective of Joe Sixpack.</p> <p>\"The issue is how different is John McCain's policy going to be than George Bush's? I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bush's\" - Biden seizes the opportunity after Palin scolds him for dwelling too much on the past, and on the Bush administration's errors.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Palin defies critics and delivers punchy performance in debate against Biden</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/03/sarahpalin.joebiden\">Video: Sarah Palin and Joe Biden clash in vice-presidential debate</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/02/uselections2008.sarahpalin2\">Campaign Diary: How the debate unfolded</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.barackobama1\">Fake pollsters try to discredit Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Aloof but a star: British envoy on Obama</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/us/politics/03assess.html?hp\">NYT: In Debate, Republican Ticket Survives One Test</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1846977,00.html\">Time: The Vice-Presidential Debate Report Cards</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/02/biden-dominates-debate-ac_n_131455.html\">The Huffington Post: Who Won The VP Debate?

  "<p>There is a long and glorious tradition in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/musicals\">musical theatre</a> of adapting literature for the stage - Les Miserables, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye_to_Berlin\">Cabaret</a>, Cats, My Fair Lady to name but a few. But American Psycho? There is an equally extensive tradition of drawing on the biographical details of significant real-life figures - think Evita, Piaf, The Sound of Music, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Oakley\">Annie Get Your Gun</a> \u2026 even Jesus Christ Superstar. But <em>Shane Warne</em>?</p> <p>Recent whisperings suggest that this pattern will continue in the two very bizarre ways suggested above. The next novel to have some song-and-dance numbers inserted will be <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821222764428\">Bret Easton-Ellis's American Psycho</a>. Yes, that one. The one with the serial killings. Now, I'm not disputing that evil people can be excellent characters in musicals - indeed, in another recent show, the creators of <a href=\"http://www.marguerite-themusical.com\">Marguerite</a> made the fatal error of making their baddie, the bullying Nazi officer, a much more well-rounded and sympathetic character than their leads. Sondheim's Sweeney Todd may not have been everyone's cup of tea (or slice of pie) but it showed that bloodshed can be treated in a grimly comic way. However, I'm not sure Patrick Bateman's descent into psychopathy and his increasingly deranged torturing of his victims prior to their murders will make for a feelgood, all-singing all-dancing night out.</p> <p>Cricketer <a href=\"www.shanewarne.com\">Shane Warne</a>, of course, is a hero to many, and thus his life and works are being acknowledged and satirised through the medium of the musical by a cheeky Aussie scamp named Eddie Perfect. The show opens in <a href=\"http://www.shanewarnethemusical.com.au/\">Melbourne</a> in December, and Warne himself is not happy, complaining: \"You should have permission off anyone to write about their life - that should be law.\" Sadly for him, it's not, and audiences will be able to enjoy renditions of songs including Take the Pill (about his ban for taking a prohibition diuretic in 2003) and What an SMS I'm In (about a rogue text message he mistakenly sent to his wife). </p> <p>But does such a show have an audience? Warne is a god to many Australians, who may not take kindly to their hero being mocked on home turf. The obvious next move for Perfect and his cast would be a UK transfer, but if he wants to cling on to the lead himself I'd guess they'll need some good stunt casting in the supporting roles to pull in the punters. I'd recommend casting Hugh Jackman (long overdue a West End return) as Warne's Hampshire team-mate and good chum Kevin Pietersen, Jennifer Ellison as Warne's ex-wife Simone, and perhaps John Barrowman as England's triumphant captain during the 2005 Ashes series, Michael Vaughan.</p> <p>Joking aside, I'm entirely in favour of new musicals. But ideally, and perhaps naively, I'd like them to be well-written, finely crafted, carefully considered and long-lasting. With these two announcements coming hot on the heels of news about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/sep/29/kylie.minogue.musical.theatre\">a show based on the work of Kylie Minogue</a>, I fear that the entire form of the musical has become increasingly devalued, viewed now simply as a lesser art form and an easy cash-cow for cynical producers.</p>",
  "<p>John Hutton's move to defence secretary is an unlikely switch for the person who - until Peter Mandelson's shock return - was regarded as the most Blairite minister in the cabinet. </p> <p>As a former flatmate of Alan Milburn's and a former colleague of Stephen Byers's, Hutton was known to have some reservations about Gordon Brown taking over the Labour leadership. </p> <p>But Brown is said to have been impressed by the former business secretary's ability to keep his head down and get the job done. </p> <p>Born in London and brought up in Essex, Hutton started his professional life as a law lecturer in Newcastle after securing a degree at Oxford. </p> <p>He unsuccessfully fought seats in the 1987 general election and 1989 European elections for Labour, before being selected for the safe Labour seat of Barrow and Furness - where Britain's nuclear submarines are built. </p> <p>Hutton has repeatedly argued not just for Trident not to be scrapped, but for more nuclear submarines to be built. </p> <p>An MP since 1992, he didn't get a spokesman role in opposition but, having voted for Tony Blair as leader and Margaret Beckett as his deputy in 1994, he became parliamentary private secretary to Beckett when Labour returned to government. </p> <p>Two years later, he became a junior health minister, where he stayed until the 2005 general election. He joined the cabinet after Labour's third victory as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. </p> <p>However, that was not to last for long. Following the second David Blunkett resignation in December that year, Hutton stepped up to the plate as work and pensions secretary. </p> <p>With the plain-speaking Yorkshireman gone, Blair saw Hutton as a calm, competent pair of hands capably of carrying out a number of unpopular measures.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson's return to the cabinet must surely earn him the title of the \"comeback king\" of British politics.</p> <p>He had already been dubbed the \"comeback kid\" after becoming the first secretary of state to return to high office - as the UK's commissioner in the European Union - after twice resigning from the cabinet.</p> <p>Now one of the most controversial figures in the Labour party is not only returning to the cabinet for a third time, he will also be serving a man with whom he fought for more than a decade. </p> <p>The Brown-Mandelson feud, which was once described as \"like scorpions in a bottle - only one will get out alive\", dates back to 1994 when Mandelson infuriated Brown by backing Tony Blair for the Labour leadership.</p> <p>His appointment will be seen as a major olive branch to Blairites in the government still smarting after Brown's perceived put-down of their favourite \u2013 the foreign secretary, David Miliband - as a \"novice\".</p> <p>Tensions between the two men eased after Mandelson left the country four years ago to become the EU's trade commissioner \u2013 a move said to have delighted Brown's supporters.</p> <p>And in recent months there were signs of a rapprochement. Mandelson began advising Brown, after the prime minister made a visit to Brussels in May, and the pair began to speak regularly on the phone. The trade commissioner even contributed to the writing of the prime minister's conference speech, which he described as a success since it \"opened more of a window on to Gordon Brown\".</p> <p>In a New Statesman interview this week, he made a rare intervention in domestic politics when he told the magazine that the party must sharpen up and \"renew New Labour\" - comments that will alarm traditionalists in the party. </p> <p>Mandelson, along with Blair and Brown, was responsible for creating the new Labour machine that gave the party its 1997 landslide victory. But the way he promoted the New Labour message \u2013 through spin, briefings and manipulation - earned him enemies and the nickname \"the Prince of Darkness\".</p> <p>Mandelson's reputation as a meddler and expert in spin was not helped by his appointment in 1997 to the job of minister without portfolio \u2013 a trouble-shooting role with special responsibility for the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Before the dome was opened, Mandelson was made trade secretary. Civil servants praised his aptitude for the role but he lasted just five months.</p> <p>He was forced to resign in December 1998 following the disclosure that he accepted a \u00a3373,000 home loan from then-paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, to buy a house in London. The disclosure was revealed in the Guardian. </p> <p>Mandelson revealed that he had not told Blair about the money lent him to buy the house in fashionable Notting Hill.</p> <p>But though he admitted he had been \"technically\" wrong not to tell his building society about the loan, he insisted there had been nothing improper about it.</p> <p>A biography, titled Mandelson, by journalist Donald Macintyre, says that in spite of their differences Brown urged Mandelson not to resign from the cabinet over the loan.</p> <p>But the book also revealed that the feud was so bad that Brown would at times ignore Mandelson at meetings with Tony Blair. In May 1996 Mandelson stormed out of a meeting before writing to the then-opposition leader, resigning as election manager.</p> <p>Not for the last time, Macintyre revealed, Blair patched up the quarrel between what he despairingly called a Greek tragedy involving \"my two best people\".</p> <p>Westminster was shocked when Mandelson made a spectacular return to the cabinet as Northern Ireland secretary in 1999.</p> <p>He quit again in 2001 after being accused of helping one of the Hinduja brothers get a British passport in return for a \u00a31m donation to the dome.</p> <p>The Indian billionaires Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja gave the cash to fund the attraction's \"faith zone\".</p> <p>Mandelson was later cleared by an inquiry of any impropriety in connection with the case.</p> <p>He insisted that he had not acted improperly and that the press was \"wrong\" to claim that he had lied.</p> <p>He blamed his departure on a failure to get \"on top of the facts\" which led to differing stories being given to the media by him and Downing Street's director of communications, Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>\"I knew I hadn't done anything wrong,\" he said. \"The allegations that were being cooked up I knew were false. I did not believe for one moment that the thing would be so badly handled and such a muddle created that it would result in my departure from government.\"</p> <p>In his victory speech in the 2001 general election, Mandelson gave an extraordinary, emotionally charged performance. The Hartlepool MP declared at a post-poll rally: \"I'm a fighter, not a quitter.\"</p> <p>At the time his words were seen as extraordinary for a man who had been forced to twice leave cabinet under a cloud. But in 2004, in another dramatic twist to his turbulent career, he was appointed as EU trade commissioner. He left the Hartlepool seat he had held sine 1992 and went to Brussels to represent the EU in world trade negotiations.</p> <p>Mandelson was born on October 21 1953 into a family with a long Labour history. His grandfather was a Labour cabinet minister, Herbert Morrison. He read philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, became director of the British Youth Council and then as a television producer with the flagship LWT political programme Weekend World. </p> <p>He first shot to prominence as Labour's director of communications, a job he was appointed to by Neil Kinnock the then-Labour leader. Mandelson transformed Labour's advertising and communications strategy in the face of opposition from a still bitterly divided Labour party. He was credited with Labour's well-run though unsuccessful election campaign of 1987.</p> <p>He fell out with Kinnock after seeking and then winning the (then) safe Labour seat of Hartlepool in 1992. For a while, under John Smith's leadership, he was a relatively minor figure. However, since 1994 he has seldom been far from the headlines. </p> <p>But no newspaper or broadcaster had predicted his return to government today, which counts as a genuine political shock. </p>",
  "<p>It's one of the worst-kept secrets on the internet that virtually any album can be downloaded, freely and illegally, by doing a Google search for, say, \"Coldplay rapidshare\", \"Radiohead rapidshare\" or \"Beyonc\u00e9 rapidshare\". But whereas RapidShare can seem like a magic word, an abracadabra that leads to an ad-festooned free downloads site, it is, in fact, a company. And although it is the general impression that everything available on RapidShare is free, it just so happens that lots of users share illegal files. </p> <p>A court ruling this week, however, may have sounded the death knell for RapidShare's business model. Germany's Hamburg district court has ruled that RapidShare uses insufficient measures to protect against piracy. The court ruled that the service must not just remove material for which it receives copyright complaints, it must proactively check content before it is made available online, at least in the case of users with previous infringements.</p> <p>Whereas American \"safe harbour\" legislation allows companies like YouTube to put their fingers in their ears and go \"la la la\", denying knowledge of copyrighted material, Germany holds its filesharing services to a higher standard. The court dismissed the safeguards RapidShare already has in place as ineffective \u2013 an automated filter and a limited number of full-time staff. It was also unmoved by RapidShare's arguments about the expense of better filtering. \"A business model that doesn't use common methods of prevention cannot claim the protection of the law,\" stated the ruling.</p> <p>Of course, the end of RapidShare would hardly spell the end of online piracy. There are many more services competing in the same grey area of \"sending files\". Even if searching for \"Coldplay rapidshare\" stopped returning results, \"Coldplay megaupload\", \"Coldplay yousendit\" and \"Coldplay sendspace\" aren't any more difficult to find. <br></p>",

  "<p>The political fallout from the resignation of Sir Ian Blair as Metropolitan police commissioner raged on today as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/03/blair.conservatives\">Boris Johnson was accused of using Blair</a> for party-political advantage. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blair\">Blair</a> quit the most senior police post in the country yesterday claiming he could not continue without the support of the mayor of London, who used his first day in power as Metropolitan Police Authority chairman on Wednesday to demand his resignation.</p> <p>David Blunkett, the former home secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning that Johnson's decision had little to do with Blair's policing record. </p> <p>\"We did agree some time ago that the mayor would become the chair of the MPA,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It did not mean [Johnson] simply had the authority to make decisions, not based on a failure of the Met commissioner in relation to policing London, or counter-terrorism in London, but because he felt he wanted to get rid of someone that the Conservative party has made it clear it did not like the look of for the last two years.\"</p> <p>Johnson had completely failed to consult on his move, he added. </p> <p>\"There is a procedure and it involves the home secretary and also fellow members of the Metropolitan Police Authority. The Metropolitan Police Authority was not involved, the home secretary was not involved. There was only one person involved and that was Boris Johnson. </p> <p>\"We need to know when a new commissioner is appointed if there was a new government there would not be a new commissioner on the back of that, and purely on the back of that.\"</p> <p>Ken Jones, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said Blair was a reformer and a liberal who changed the culture of the Metropolitan Police. </p> <p>Asked on Today if he was worried about the politicisation of the police, he said: \"Yes, we are concerned, particularly at the senior level.<br> \"My view is chiefs and commissioners are not in a dissimilar position to judges. </p> <p>\"They need to balance constantly vested interests, populism, various pressures and ultimately they are accountable to law. </p> <p>\"We need politicians of all persuasions to recognise the dilemmas they face and to give them their support.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We do need to avoid the politicisation, even by implication, that we see in some American forces where law and order and politics are bound together in a toxic way. We can't ever get to a position in this country where that happens.\"</p> <p>Last night, Kit Malthouse, London's deputy mayor for policing, refused to give a clear explanation of why the Conservative mayor had forced the commissioner to go. </p> <p>Malthouse told the BBC's Newsnight: \"We believe there are better people. In many ways these are matters of judgment. Sadly it is not a complex decision. It is a binary decision. The switch is on or it is off. We took the decision to turn the switch off.\"</p> <p>Tony Travers, an expert on the capital from the London School of Economics, said today that the decision showed that the accountability of the Metropolitan police authority was in a \"muddle\".</p> <p>Travers told the Today: \"It is a very big switch and I think there is a serious sense of walking into the unknown in this decision and it clearly shows the accountability of the Metropolitan Police Authority is a muddle.\"</p> <p>He said Johnson had introduced a new dimension into the appointment of the next police commissioner, since Johnson had made it clear the home secretary's appointment of the next commissioner would need his complete approval or he would get rid of them.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith , the home secretary, last night attacked the manner of Blair's departure and Johnson's failure to \"respect\" the process in place. </p> <p>By statute only the home secretary can appoint and dismiss the Met commissioner.<br> Speaking on BBC1's Question Time last night, Smith said: \"There's a process in place that the mayor chose not to respect. </p> <p>\"What is important when you are both choosing and when you're supporting somebody that you're asking to do a job like that is that you keep party politics out of it. You need to work alongside people and, frankly, you should put some time and effort into that. </p> <p>\"The mayor said on the first day in his job he didn't feel he had confidence in Sir Ian and that's why he took the decision to resign.\" </p> <p>But Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police and former Lib Dem candidate for mayor of London, said today that Smith was also instrumental in Blair's departure. </p> <p>He told the BBC this morning: \"On the day the mayor becomes the chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority he says boo and the commissioner jumps. </p> <p>\"Not only that, it is actually only the home secretary that could force the commissioner to leave and therefore the home secretary could have turned round and said to Ian Blair and to the mayor: 'I'm sorry, you don't have the power, mayor, to do that. I want the commissioner to stay.' But she didn't; she allowed the commissioner to go.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/police.london\">Writing in today's Guardian, Ken Livingstone, Johnson's predecessor as mayor</a>, claimed that there had been a vendetta against Blair from the first day of his commissionership. </p> <p>\"The decisive voices were not those who criticised him from the left but those who want an end to what they call 'politically correct' - that is, non-racist \u2013 policing in London.\" </p> <p>Smith said that Sir Paul Stephenson, the deputy commissioner, would take over as acting head when Blair stands down on December 1.</p>",
  "<p>What is it they say about a change being as good as a rest? It's only a couple of weeks since St Helens demolished Leeds with such conviction in the Super League play-offs, suggesting that a likely rematch in the grand final at Old Trafford could only go one way. But having spent the bulk of the last fortnight in involuntary isolation from rugby league, the prospect of that rematch seems a good deal more appealing.<br> It also turns out that I owe a couple of you an apology. I've not been online since filing a blog the Monday after that last Saints-Leeds game (because of an unprofessionally-planned family arrival, I should add, so please don't slag me off for taking time off at such a crucial stage of the season), so it was a bit of a shock to see the stick I got for that last column. But a fortnight on, fair enough, you're right - it was an unnecessarily negative piece. I think the basic premise still holds \u2013 as even Leon Pryce admitted in this week's Guardian, the fact that Leeds are the only team who have come remotely close to challenging Saints on a consistent basis for the last three seasons is not good for the Super League. And that's why the Rhinos' inability to compete at Knowsley Road the other week was such a disappointment for all us neutrals hoping for a repeat of last autumn's classic at the same stage of the play-offs. But there were plenty more interesting and uplifting things to talk about than that. For example the acting-half brilliance with which Keiron Cunningham laid on James Roby's quickfire double that sealed Saints' passage to Old Trafford was pretty much invisible in the gloom through the window of the press box at the back of the old Knowsley Road stand, but shone out thrillingly when I finally had time to watch the Sky rerun. Nick Fozzard was also terrific, which must have been as encouraging for the Hull KR fans who will be cheering him next season as it was for Saints in the build-up to Old Trafford \u2013 on that evidence, the departing prop mightn't be a bad outside bet for the Harry Sunderland award as man of the match in the grand final, although I've got a sneaking feeling this might be the time when Cunningham finally receives the individual honour that has somehow eluded him for so long. But the piece I should have written the other Monday, if only for the fact I've been waiting to do it all season, was a proper tribute to Paul Sculthorpe, who announced his retirement with typically impressive dignity at half-time in the Leeds game. It already seems like a fair while since Scully was in his pomp and pretty much winning matches every other Friday night for Ian Millward's slightly scattier Saints than the ruthless machine that Daniel Anderson has subsequently created. Perhaps it's the regularity of those heroics at Knowsley Road that make a couple of performances away from home stand out in my mind: first, his contribution to Great Britain's first Test win against Chris Anderson's Kangaroos in Huddersfield in 2001, when he scored two of those trademark powerhouse tries from close range and showed the Aussies what all the fuss was about; and second, that unforgettable comeback in the World Club Challenge against Brisbane Broncos in Bolton the February before last. Any other favourite Sculthorpe moments gratefully accepted below. But back to the matter in hand, the grand final, and given the appallingly and uncomfortably self-indulgent tone of this piece so far, I've just phoned up Chris Joynt for a few memories of 1999 that might prove relevant this weekend. It was in 1999, only the second year that the Super League champions were determined by the play-offs culminating in the grand final, that Ellery Hanley's St Helens were humiliated 40-4 by the Bradford Bulls at Odsal in the qualifying semi-final, only to bounce back two weeks later by beating them 8-6 at Old Trafford \u2013 the closest equivalent to what Leeds will have to do if they are to be at least competitive this year. \"Yeah, that rings a bell,\" confirmed Joynt, the captain of that '99 Saints team - who turned out to be clay pigeon shooting in Marbella this week, as you do. \"I don't remember it all that clearly and we definitely didn't do anything special to come back from it. It just confirms what anyone who has played sport at that level will tell you anyway, big games like a grand final are all about what happens on the day and nothing to do with what happened two weeks earlier. \"Leeds will be smarting from the game at Knowsley Road the other week and I do think they've had a big advantage in having an extra game against Wigan last week while Saints had the week off. I don't like Saints having had that week off to be honest, even though they've benefited from that in the past. As a former Saints man obviously I'm leaning towards them but it's too close to call really between two top sides.\" My far less informed prediction is that the formidable defence which has been the key to all the success St Helens have enjoyed under Anderson for the last four seasons will again soak up everything that Leeds can throw at it, allowing Saints to establish a narrow half-time lead before going on to win by at least 10 points. But please don't take that as a suggestion that Super League is boringly predictable. I've learned my lesson.</p>",
  "<p>Is journalism the reason that people are buying fewer newspapers? And, by implication, are journalists therefore to blame for the crisis facing the press? My unhesitating answer to both questions: no.</p> <p>I have not made that clear enough in what I have written previously while documenting the decline of newsprint newspapers. So, prompted by an excellent analysis in the latest <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/\">American Journalism Review</a>, let me put that right.</p> <p>There cannot be any doubt that journalists themselves - the reporters, sub-editors, photographers, feature writers, columnists, page designers - cannot be held responsible for either the financial woes of the industry nor for the public turning its back on the \"products\" that contain their work.</p> <p>Even if we concede that <em>some</em> journalists lived high on the hog in past times and that, through the <a href=\"http://www.nuj.org.uk/\">National Union of Journalists</a> in <em>some</em> papers, they defended overmanning and were guilty of low output, they are still blameless. In general, as providers of the basic content, they have performed their tasks in good faith and with a dedication that marked them out from every other newspaper employee (and some employers). </p> <p>This is as true of journalists in Britain's nationals as it is of those working for regional daily and local weekly papers. It is also true of broadcasting journalists and those who work on magazines. We, the infantry, the people who create the raw material, have no reason to feel guilty.</p> <p>It is important to say this - to say it to ourselves, and to say it to the public (the people we seek to serve) - as we record the gradual demise of newspapers and the weekly roll-call of redundancies. It isn't our fault.</p> <p>The truth is that we are being assailed by revolutionary technological forces completely outside of our control. To make it worse, the wider global financial crisis means that we are caught up in something of a perfect storm. It is wrecking the business models of newspapers and overturning all the old certainties. </p> <p>We journalists are <em><strong>not</strong></em> paying the price for our own (alleged) failures. Whether your are an enthusiastic supporter of the digital age as it heralds the replacement of top-down journalism with bottom-up journalism, or whether you remain a stubborn believer in the virtues of journalists as information gatekeepers, you are not the cause of the current calamity. </p> <p>Both digital revolutionaries and dinosaurs face the same sad situation because the economic catastrophe has robbed media companies of the chance to make a smooth transition from one platform to another.</p> <p>It was always going to be difficult to effect the switch of advertising from print to online. We also recognised that website revenue would never achieve the volumes enjoyed by print. But that already rocky road has now been struck by an earthquake. Collapse is imminent. </p> <p>Writing from a US perspective, <strong>Washington Post</strong> reporter <strong>Paul Farhi</strong> points out in his AJR article, <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4623\">Don't blame the journalism</a>, that the long-run cycle of newspaper decline is not due to newspapers (and journalists) but is \"everything to do with the newspaper business.\" He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Even a paper stocked with the world's finest editorial minds wouldn't have a fighting chance against the economic and technological forces arrayed against the business. The critics have it exactly backward: journalists and journalism are the victims, not the cause, of the industry's shaken state.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, we British journalists do tend to believe that American journalism is boring and unreadable. But the interesting fact - <em>FACT</em> - is that the declining sales and declining profits of US and UK newspapers are roughly similar in scale despite the differences between their journalism and our journalism. Here's Farhi again:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The problem has little to do with the reporting, packaging and selling of information. It's much bigger than that. The gravest threats include the flight of classified advertisers, the deterioration of retail advertising and the indebtedness of newspaper owners. </p> <p>\"Wrap all these factors together and you've set in motion the kind of slash-and-burn tactics that will hasten, not forestall, the end.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And then he moves on to the digital revolution's major effect on the business:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The real revelation of the internet is not what it has done to newspaper readership \u2013 it has in fact expanded it \u2013 but how it has sapped newspapers' economic lifeblood. The most serious erosion has occurred in classified advertising, which once made up more than 40% of a newspaper's revenues and more than half its profits. </p> <p>\"Classified advertisers didn't desert newspapers because they disliked our political coverage or our sports sections, but because they had alternatives.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's more to appreciate in his lengthy piece too. Despite its American specificity, it applies to Britain. But where do we go from here? If large media companies do collapse will the journalism of the future be a vocational activity? Now there's a question.</p>",
  "<p>The traditional French press faces death unless it finds new ways to compete with freesheet and online rivals, says the country's president <strong>Nicolas Sarkozy</strong>. He was reflecting on the problems faced by France's national dailies because two free titles, <strong>Metro</strong> and <strong>20 Minutes</strong>, have become the most read newspapers and internet news has become increasingly popular.</p> <p>There have been strikes and redundancies at <strong>Le Monde</strong> and <strong>Le Figaro</strong>, and takeovers at <strong>Liberation</strong> and the business titles, <strong> La Tribune</strong> and <strong>Les Echos</strong>. Much of France's magazine press is also struggling.</p> <p>Sarkozy insists that there is room in the market both for advertising-funded freesheets and paid-for high-quality print news and analysis. \"It is madness to believe advertising can pay for all our news,\" he told press industry leaders yesterday. \"The idea that all news can be free is an illusion that would spell the death of the written press.\"</p> <p>French newspapers, which enjoy annual state subsidies of \u20ac1bn (\u00a3790m), are among the least profitable in Europe.

  "<p>Recent polling data from <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/\">Ipsos Mori</a> makes depressing reading for anyone who thinks housing should be further up the agenda of this government, or the next.</p> <p>Just <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/_assets/pdfs/september%20issues%20index%20topline.pdf\">13% think (pdf)</a> housing is one of the most important issues facing the UK; even fewer (9%) say it's very important in deciding which party they will vote for at the next general election. Intriguingly though, 26% think the Tories have the best housing policies, compared with just 23% for labour.</p> <p>Concerned that so many voters appear better acquainted with Tory housing policy than I am, I turned to the smart new Conservative party <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Housing.aspx\">website</a>, where I learned of Tory plans to scrap stamp duty for first time buyers on properties up to \u00a3250,000, and to get rid of home information packs. Hardly a ground-breaking policy agenda. But I was also reminded that shadow housing minister, Grant Shapps, is very keen on social justice. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/housing\">he believes</a> the level of homelessness in society \"to be a truer measure of how civilised we are than almost any other factor\". </p> <p>To give them their due, earlier this year David Cameron launched the Conservative Homelessness Foundation. But so far, <a href=\"http://shelter-hosting.org.uk/adamsampson/?p=93\">according</a> to Shelter's Adam Sampson, \"The trouble is the Conservatives are very careful not to commit themselves to the sort of policies that would actually solve the problem.\" While seven policy papers have been published under Cameron's leadership, they haven't yet got round to housing and homelessness. Indeed, apart from Shapps' own <a href=\"http://www.shapps.com/reports/Discharged-to-no-fixed-abode-v10.pdf\">report (pdf)</a> into the numbers of people being discharged from hospital with no home to go to (admittedly a good barometer of the extent of the housing crisis) the Tories seems pretty much policy free. The fact that they are perceived as ahead of Labour on the issue can only reflect general disillusion with the government.</p> <p>It's worth recalling a few statistics: In England alone, more than a million children live in sub-standard housing; 8.1m homes fail to meet the government's <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/SocialHousingAndCareHomes/RepairsToCouncilHomes/DG_10021332\">Decent Homes Standard</a>; 1.7m households are on local authority waiting lists; more than 500,000 households are overcrowded; under Labour, the number of homeless households has doubled to 1m; at the end of last year, nearly 80,000 households were living in temporary accommodation, three quarters of which have dependent children. And even before the economic crisis hit, a 50% annual rise in mortgage repossessions (to 45,000) was forecast for 2008. </p> <p>This is bad by the standards of any civilised society, and it's been getting steadily worse throughout a period of unprecedented growth and stability. Now the economic chickens have come home to roost, more families will be affected, and more severely. If these figures represent the best we can do in good times, then what hope for the immediate future?</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the same polling data revealed that 41% think the economy is the second most important issue facing the country (after crime and law and order). Presumably, many respondents fear the impact of the economic crisis on their own situation, especially if they have mortgages to pay. It's understandable that people worry more about themselves when the going gets tough, but the experience doesn't seem to help them identify with the plight of those for whom the going is always tough.</p> <p>If Shapps' definition of a civilised society is correct then homelessness is an acute moral issue, even if it fails to register with the moral sensitivities of most voters. As with residual unemployment, people seem to have been persuaded of the 'structural' nature of homelessness. It's become part of the price we have to pay for the wider benefits of a modern, growth-driven society. If the City of London Corporation can get away with its policy of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/24/homelessness.rough.sleepers\">wetting down</a>\" to drive rough sleepers off the streets without a public outcry, then little wonder that politicians are not inclined to take homelessness more seriously.</p> <p>Nobody quite knew how the government was going to pay for the 3m new homes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/12/housesfittolivein\">promised</a> by Gordon Brown soon after he became prime minister. Obviously this target will not now be reached, whoever wins the next election. In his speech to the Conservative party conference this week, Shapps promised to remove some of the regulatory obstacles to building more homes, but if the market was unable to deliver enough of the right kind of homes before the financial crisis hit, there is no chance of it so doing now.</p> <p>Once the current crisis in under control, several things need to happen: more people need to become aware of the scale of the problem; more people need to develop a greater empathy with the plight of homeless people; more people need to become aware of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/10/comment.society\">fundamental flaws</a> in current economic thinking that makes widespread homelessness inevitable even in rich countries, and even during boom times. But perhaps most importantly, a maverick politician \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.joncruddas.org.uk/\">Cruddas</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.vincentcable.org.uk/\">Cable</a>, or even perhaps a Shapps \u2013 needs to focus our attention on this appalling moral failure by banging on relentlessly about the importance of housing to a civilised society.</p>",
  "<p>I've often thought that panel shows are only as good as they book. But solid backup from the host and team captains can usually rescue even the shakiest of lineups.</p> <p>So it was with some trepidation that I tuned into the new series of Never Mind the Buzzcocks last night, as the show returned for its 22nd series on BBC2 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/18/bbc.television1\">without the reassuring presence of Bill Bailey</a>.</p> <p>Replacing Bill was going to be a job of work so the programme makers have gone for the same strategy they used to fill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/14/broadcasting.bbc\">the gap left by Mark Lamarr in the host's seat</a> and picked a selection of guest captains. Presumably one of these will get the gig permanently as happened with Simon Amstell.</p> <p>Confirmed captains include Stephen Fry, Dermot O'Leary and Johnny Vegas. Some obviously won't be serious contenders. It's hard to imagine Stephen Fry regularly putting up with hissy fits from pop prima donnas but stranger things have happened in tellyland so place your bets now while the odds are good, people ...</p> <p>Last night kicked off with super-producer Mark Ronson in the hot seat. He was a perfectly good guest on the last series as I recall, so my hopes were high.</p> <p>He clearly took the responsibility seriously but this seemed to hamper his performance if anything. By his own admission, he was incredibly nervous and that's hardly surprising given the number of references to the absent Bailey - one of which culminated in an Amstell-Jupitus dance routine that's burned on to my retina, despite the fact I was watching through my fingers.</p> <p>Ronson eventually loosened up, however, and took all the usual baiting with good humour. But he rarely took control of the show so ultimately it felt like he was an extra guest instead of a guest captain.</p> <p>Mark Ronson isn't a professional TV host or stand-up comedian - both of which thrive in this situation - so he acquitted himself pretty well. And even if the show lacked its usual pace, this was my no means a dull episode. Nonetheless, I'm hoping that there's better to come over the next few weeks.</p> <p>So what did you think? Did Ronson's brief tenure trumpet the arrival of the new series of Buzzcocks? Or did he drop a clanger? Post your comment below.</p>",
  "<p>Well, after all that build-up, the great debate wasn't all that great. And it probably won't end up changing very much.</p> <p>Let's cut to the chase: Sarah Palin passed the what-is-she-doing-here test. The frantic-paced format, with few real follow-up questions, was good for her. Moderator Gwen Ifill refrained from asking any probing questions about, say, Troopergate or her abortion position, that would have put her on the spot and forced her to defend her record. </p> <p>Also, Palin was able to sort of plow ahead rhetorically and eat up clock. She made no really humiliating mistakes, although she teetered on the edge once \u2013 the debate's most fascinating moment, which we'll get to. </p> <p>There were many occasions when she didn't actually answer the question that was asked. There was even one occasion when she said she wasn't going to answer the question, about John McCain's healthcare policy. How much that bothers people I don't know, but it began to show as the debate wore on, I think, particularly during the foreign policy section. But she did lift herself into a post-Couric phase. For now, she's not an embarrassment any more. </p> <p>The fascinating moment. It came at 10:15pm. The one really interesting question Ifill asked was about Dick Cheney's theory of the vice-presidency. At one point in 2007, as Cheney was trying not to comply with an executive order on classified information, he actually <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/22/cheney_asserts_hes_part_of_the_legislative_branch/\">asserted that the vice-president wasn't part of the executive branch</a> (he argued this on the grounds that under the Constitution, the vice-president also presides over the Senate). Ifill asked both if they agreed with Cheney.</p> <p>Biden casually delivered an excellent answer about Cheney's serial assaults on the Constitution, one of his best of the night. As for Palin \u2013 here, finally, with just 15 minutes to go, came the first question for which she clearly hadn't been prepped. On everything else \u2013 the economy, Wall Street, healthcare, Iraq, Iran \u2013 she'd been given her talking points and she'd (mostly) hit them. But this question wasn't on the list. Her answer was utter gibberish. For 90 seconds, the Couric Palin returned. I'm pretty sure I even heard her say in there somewhere that the powers of the vice-presidency should be expanded. That's just what we need. </p> <p>During that question, she looked like an automaton whose batteries were running out on her, causing brain-wire shorts. But the next question was expected. Education or something. Boy, was she ready for that one.</p> <p>Let's talk base v swing voters. I think the conservative base certainly leaves the debate relieved. Some portions of it will be highly excited. There will surely be spin Friday and over the weekend about how Palin has reignited the McCain campaign. Liberals shouldn't dismiss this. Such talk can create a reality, under the right circumstances. </p> <p>But I don't think she connected well enough with swing voters. The CBS News flash poll of uncommitted voters said: Biden 46%, Palin 21%, draw 33%. CNN's similar poll had Biden winning 51-36%. </p> <p>So how did Biden do? Quite well. A little too facts-and-figuresy, as any longtime senator is wont to be. But he was quite good on the kitchen-table stuff. He was clearly superior on foreign policy. He had a couple of good moments of tying Bush around McCain's throat, although he should have done it more often. He displayed very good self-control; he knows \"General McClelland\" in Afghanistan is actually General McKiernan, but he never corrected her. And he actually showed genuine human emotion there for a second, while talking about his family. I mean authentic genuine emotion. I thought that was outlawed in politics.</p> <p>As always with debates, let's see what happens over the next two or three days. If nothing else, the drip, drip, drip of clips of Palin making an idiot of herself to Katie Couric is over, replaced by clips of her performing passably well as a debater. She made herself less of a liability. No greater claim can be made for her than that. </p> <p>Given the way things have been going for John McCain these last few days, I'm sure he'll take that. But make no mistake that this debate was only the second biggest campaign story of the day. The biggest was <a href=\"http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/POLITICS01/810020462/1361\">this one</a>. Not even close.</p>"
