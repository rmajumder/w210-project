  "<p>It was 1am when the phone rang and I heard the voice of my teenage son: \"I'm downstairs. Bring ice.\" By the time I reached the front door he was there with three friends, one of whom had been bottled and beaten up in an unprovoked attack as the boys walked home from a school friend's party. </p> <p>There is much wringing of hands over violent crime among teenagers. Everyone bemoans the number of kids who now carry knives and after each incident pronouncements are made on the need to give the police new powers to deal with the problem. But is that really what is needed? This week it was announced there have been more allegations made against the police than at any time since the introduction of an independent complaints procedure. Some 22,000 of these complaints were over \"neglect or failure of duty\". Therein, I believe, lies a crucial clue to what is really needed. </p> <p>When Nick was bottled, my son tried to help him, but was beaten back by the assailant's numerous mates. Another of my son's friends ran to a safe distance and dialled 999. He was told to go to a police station. As soon as they were able to, that is what the boys did \u2013 only to be greeted by a locked door. It transpired that all but two police stations in our borough are closed at weekends. Yes, shut on Saturday nights. Teenage crime, of course, happens at 10am on Tuesdays, doesn't it?</p> <p>The following day (having first checked Nick's health of course) we drove to one of the two open police stations. The police were pleasant and took the boys seriously but the computer was down and details were noted in pencil. They police tried to take photos of Nick's injures but none came out \u2013 they were using an ancient Polaroid camera. </p> <p>We provided the police with: the broken glass retrieved from the scene (using rubber gloves and a clean container); digital photos of the injuries and of where the attack took place; the name and telephone number of the owners of the CCTV camera that pointed straight at the spot where it happened; and (with help from mutual acquaintances and Facebook) the name and school of the main perpetrator and two of his accomplices. </p> <p>Confident they had handed the police a strong set of evidence, the boys were pleased to think this violent young man would soon learn you cannot treat people like that. </p> <p>Various letters arrived for my son informing him of victim support and giving him a name and phone number for police follow-up. Neither the name or phone number were correct. When I finally reached the right person they told me proudly that they had found CCTV that looked right at the spot. Unfortunately, they'd got the wrong spot. When I asked what they had found on the glass there was almost a laugh at the other end: \"That takes many weeks,\" I was told. \"There's a queue. Murders and rapes will go before y . . . It's all a waiting game in the CID.\" </p> <p>So we waited. Four months. Finally, I made a fuss, pointing out to the police that their delay and apparent disinterest was not sending a great message to law-abiding teenagers. Too late. The CCTV we actually needed had been taped over. Four months is forever in the life of a teenager and the boys \u2013 now in the middle of public exams \u2013 had put the incident from their minds. In an ID parade only two out of four of them picked out the (cleverly disguised) main culprit. The Crown Prosecution Service, quite rightly, said the evidence was too weak to take to court. </p> <p>It happens that I occasionally sit in criminal courts (for professional not family reasons!). Of the last three trials I have heard, two have fallen because the police did not collect the necessary, and available, evidence. In one case there were over a dozen eye witnesses. Not one had been contacted by police. Asked why, the police officer replied: \"The victim didn't give us any names.\" </p> <p>New draconian police powers are not what is needed. What we need is for the police to have sufficient manpower, resources, and commitment to do their existing job properly. </p> <p>After yet another news story of teenage knife crime, my son shrugged his shoulders and said: \"Well, lets face it, you can't rely on the police to do anything, can you?\"</p> <p>\u2022 All names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>More than 20 sick children, some of them about to undergo surgery, were evacuated from Great Ormond Street children's hospital yesterday after an explosion and fire. </p> <p>The hospital's chief executive, Dr Jane Collins, said the incident - thought to involve a gas cylinder - had been in the cardiac wing of the central London hospital. No staff or patients were injured, but all yesterday's outpatient and daycare appointments were cancelled. \"There was a fire in our cardiac block this morning that seemed to have led to an explosion, probably that of a medical gas cylinder,\" Collins said. \"We obviously put our major incident plan into action very quickly and evacuated all of the patients and staff from that block.\" </p> <p>She added that some children due to have surgery yesterday were being anaesthetised when the fire broke out and were woken up to make sure they were \"in a stable and safe situation\". </p> <p>Six fire engines and 35 firefighters were called after the blaze started at 8.35am, a spokesman for the fire brigade said. Four firefighters were treated at the scene for minor injuries and were later taken to hospital for further checks. Paul Glenny, a London fire brigade station manager, said: \"Twenty-three patients and 12 staff members were evacuated from the building before fire crews wearing breathing apparatus brought the fire under control.\" The fire brigade has launched an investigation into the cause of the fire.</p> <p>Darren Ryall, 47, a builder working at the hospital, said the explosion sounded like \"a skip being dropped out of a window\". He said: \"The evacuation was fantastic. There were children being brought out wrapped in blankets and in about five to 10 minutes everyone was out.\"</p> <p>Philip Dennis, from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, whose 10-week-old son, Theo, is in intensive care at the hospital, said it took about an hour before he and his wife were told their son had been moved to a different ward. \"A million things went through my mind; obviously you worry. But they phoned to tell us that he was well, he was asleep and he had been moved.\"</p> <p>The cancellation of appointments caused some heartache as children and parents, some of whom travel for hours to the hospital, were told to return home. Robert and Joy Hayman had taken the train from Great Yarmouth with their two-year-old son, Philip, at 5.30 yesterday morning. \"We were supposed to get his results and we have been very worried so obviously it is very frustrating,\" said Mr Hayman. </p> <p>Collins said the hospital was open again for emergencies and hoped to return to planned work today.</p>",
  "<h2>MoD official to be charged over lost documents</h2> <p>A senior Ministry of Defence official who left two highly classified documents about al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces on a train is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act. The documents, left on a train to Waterloo in June, were passed to the BBC, which then handed them to the police. It had been widely assumed in Whitehall that the official, who has already been suspended, would be disciplined by internal procedures rather than charged under the criminal law. He has been summoned by police to be interviewed under caution.<br><strong>Richard Norton-Taylor</strong></p> <h2>PC faces court over death of girl hit by patrol car</h2> <p>A police officer is to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a teenager was killed when she was hit by a patrol car, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday. Hayley Adamson, 16, from Newcastle upon Tyne, was crossing Denton Road in the city on May 19 when the police car hit her. PC John James Dougal, who has been suspended, is to be charged after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Hayley's family have been told of the decision. A second police officer, who was driving behind Dougal's car, will not be charged, the CPS said.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Galliano turns to 'tribal chic' for Paris show</h2> <p>Tribal chic was how British designer John Galliano, who has been at the helm of Christian Dior for 11 years, described his show in Paris yesterday. On the catwalk, tough black python jackets, tightly belted at the waist and worn with short, pleated silk skirts were not the average sort of tribal chic fodder the summer collections can often throw up. This was a more sassy tribal woman altogether. The most obvious reference to the show's title was in the hairstyling - the models' hair was crimped and pulled back into chignons that were shaped like the mini tribal drums usually found on hippy stalls.<br><strong>Imogen Fox</strong></p> <h2>Footballer arrested after alleged assault</h2> <p>A Premiership footballer has been arrested after an alleged assault on a woman at the weekend. Police were called at 6am on Sunday to an incident at a flat in the Sefton Park area of Liverpool. The South African international and Everton footballer Steven Pienaar, who was born in Johannesburg, went to a police station voluntarily later that morning and was arrested. He was released on police bail. The midfielder, currently recovering from a broken toe, was part of the South Africa squad in the 2002 World Cup and played for the country at the 2008 African Cup of Nations in Ghana.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Girls born heavy have greater breast cancer risk</h2> <p>Girls have a greater risk of breast cancer later in life if they are born heavy, scientists have found. Medical records of 22,058 patients revealed that girls who weighed 2.5kg to 3kg (6.6lbs) at birth had a 9.4% risk of cancer by the age of 80, compared with 11.6% of those who weighed 3.5kg to 4kg. The study, led by Isabel dos Santos Silva at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which appears in the journal PLoS Medicine, also found that cancer risk rose with a baby's length. \"It may be that a baby's exposure to hormones in the womb affects their growth and cancer risk,\" Silva said. <br><strong>Ian Sample</strong></p> <h2>Disciplinary hearing on top IVF doctor adjourned</h2> <p>A General Medical Council disciplinary hearing against IVF doctor Mohamed Taranissi was adjourned yesterday. Taranissi, who runs the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London, is accused of misconduct in relation to two patients. The allegations concern record-keeping, carrying out inappropriate tests and acting in an insensitive manner towards one husband, allegations he has said he will refute. He has been involved in legal actions against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the BBC's Panorama after an HFEA raid on his clinic which the high court ruled unlawful. <br><strong>Sarah Boseley</strong></p> <h2>Half of students say flirty women at fault for rape</h2> <p>An Amnesty International report has found almost half of Northern Ireland's university students believe a woman is totally or partially responsible for being raped if she is flirtatious. In a poll released last night on students' attitudes to sexual violence in Northern Ireland, Amnesty also revealed that one-third of respondents felt a woman was partially or totally responsible if it was known she had many past sexual partners. The human rights organisation, along with campaigners against sexual violence in Northern Ireland, described the findings as \"shocking and very disturbing\".<br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p>",
  "<p>Anti-terrorism chiefs were so fearful that suicide bombers would attack Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament that they banned anyone from entering or leaving the buildings for 90 minutes, it was revealed yesterday.</p> <p>The centres of British power, as well as New Scotland Yard, were believed to be potential targets in the aftermath of the July 7 2005 bombings in London.</p> <p>The revelation came from Peter Clarke, the former head of the anti-terrorist branch at Scotland Yard, as he gave evidence at the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell tube station on July 22 that year.</p> <p>All three buildings, which are classed as \"iconic\" targets for terrorists, were locked down for an hour and a half, Clarke revealed. He was trying to impress on the jury the tense atmosphere that hung over the capital in the run-up to the shooting dead of De Menezes by police who mistook him for a suicide bomber.</p> <p>Clarke said the lockdown happened on July 12 2005, after a bomb factory used to make the July 7 bombs was discovered in Leeds, followed by police finding a car at Luton train station whose boot contained explosive materials and a firearm. CCTV from the station suggested a possible fifth suicide bomber was on the loose.</p> <p>The former anti-terror chief said: \"It was completely unprecedented, as was some of the decision-making having to be made at that time about whether to warn the public about the possibility of a suicide bomber being on the loose or not.</p> <p>\"I remember those as being some of the most difficult decisions that one had ever confronted. If we warned the public, we could cause unnecessary panic. If we didn't and something terrible happened, the obvious question is: why didn't you warn the public?</p> <p>\"That is the sort of pressure we were working under day in, day out. July 12 is but one example.\" </p> <p>Clarke, who headed Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism command at the time of the July 7 attacks, revealed that his 16-year-old son was nearly caught up at the scene of one bombing, at King's Cross. Clarke advised him to get a bus, minutes before one was blown up by a suicide bomber.</p> <p>His son was heading to Cambridge and called his father, who was at home, to tell him of the chaos at King's Cross. Unknown to police at that time, a bomb had been exploded on an underground train between King's Cross and Russell Square stations.</p> <p>Clarke told the jury: \"He phoned me at home and said, 'What should I do, there appears to be smoke and people running.'</p> <p>\"So I gave him the instruction to get away from there as quickly as possible and in fact we, my wife and I, told him to get on a bus to get away.\"</p> <p>Clarke told the inquest that his wife had probably suffered delayed shock after her son's narrow escape. Clarke pulled out of a family holiday, but had then hoped to finally get some leave to comfort his wife.</p> <p>He finally set off to join his family on July 21, only to be called back to duty after the attempted second set of suicide bomb attacks.</p> <p>Clarke also told the inquest that after the July 7 attacks officers had been issued with instructions on how a suicide bomber might be recognised. They were told to look out for people who were sweating. mumbling, praying, were recently-clean shaven, looking anxious or \"wearing bulky clothing not in keeping with the weather or event\", and also to \"look for a wire or toggle protruding from an overtly carried bag\".</p> <p>In the event of coming across a suspect, officers were told to call for armed officers and bomb disposal experts.</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",

This is a good thing. But if this were just a group show, what would it be about? History and place, art and life, object relations; there's a depth and complexity here that, it would be nice to think, might overtake the usual chat about winners and losers. </p> <p>Some chance. In 2007, it was clear that Mark Wallinger should win - both on the strength of earlier work and on the film he exhibited, which had Wallinger wandering Mies van der Rohe's Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin in a bear suit. The ghost of Mies returns again in the work of 2008 nominee Goshka Macuga, who includes several sculptures shown in the Neue Nationalgalerie earlier this year. </p> <p>Macuga's installations invariably quote and even include the works of earlier artists. She appropriates them in order to tell her own stories, as well as theirs. Here she focuses on Mies and his partner and collaborator, Lilly Reich, an often overlooked figure who stayed in Germany when Mies emigrated to the US in 1938; and on British modernist artists Paul Nash and Eileen Agar. The two pairs of lovers are at the heart of Macuga's installation, where a gentle shower of graphite strokes, a light pencilled rain, falls across the walls. This is rather beautiful. </p> <p>Also on the walls are several framed assemblages of photographic and other material, all sourced from the Tate's archive, in which Macuga makes collages out of copies of photographs and other ephemeral papers by Nash and Agar, who had a long affair during the 1930s and 40s. A photograph of Agar in a bathing suit has been pasted on to a Nash photograph of tree trunks. She is oblivious to the axe planted in the timber behind her head. In another image, she reclines in a landscape of wrecked bombers. One of Agar's strange watercolour figures walks across another Nash shot, a botched photo of a country cottage enveloped in foreboding shadow. More simply, it looks as if Nash's thumb got in the way.</p> <p>There are intimations of disaster and war and love gone wrong everywhere, but it is all held in a kind of stilled suspension. Macuga's sculptures, with their planes of tinted glass and polished steel rails, are derived from exhibition display stands designed by Reich. They display nothing, and are stripped back to pure sculptural form. But they beg a kind of use, to be leaned on or stood within and peered through, and have about them a sense of emptiness and absence and possibility. All this is oddly moving. </p> <p>Trauma and wretchedness whack you in the face as soon as you walk into Cathy Wilkes' I Give You All My Money. One approaches gingerly. The space is brightly lit. A shop mannequin sits on a lavatory, cross-legged, elegant and naked, but for her nurse's hat and lots of things draped and dangling from her head - rusty horseshoes, a cup, charred bits of wood, a seashell, a deflated balloon. She doesn't seem to notice. A second mannequin leans against one of two full-size supermarket checkout counters. Ash is smeared on her face; her head is enclosed in a birdcage. Life is stupid and awful. These are Stepford Wives who have discovered the truth, and it isn't funny. </p> <p>As is usual in Wilkes' tableaux, there is a lot of stuff one wishes wasn't there. That's like life, too. Bowls and opened jars smeared with food litter the checkout counters, each with a plastic spoon; all the spoons point in the same direction. There's a stove and other bits of homely detritus. I don't know how to read the half of Wilkes' installations. Unless, that is, I'm thinking too hard. Inarticulate stumbling towards meaning is part of her subject, and a way of speaking. Literature and theatre deal with this all the time. Wilkes' art is a poke in the eye, a sort of curse. She goes on and on doing the same thing, and her insistence is telling and painful.</p> <p>Runa Islam has three film installations here, and more new work at White Cube in east London. The conjunction seems to me to be more than coincidence, and is perhaps overkill. </p> <p>Islam is an impressive film-maker, who takes as much care over the presentation of her films as of what goes on up on the screen. In a tasteful pale green room, we watch a nice young woman smash to bits the kind of crockery my parents had. Tea spills like blood. The texture of the film is reminiscent of a Good Housekeeping photoshoot, circa 1960, the atmosphere redolent of repressively correct behaviour. Smash! Islam also returns to Dhaka in Bangladesh, where she was born, to film rickshaw drivers resting beside a deserted avenue. And she films the workshop of camera motion-control pioneer Harry Harrison, who worked on Lord of the Rings, in New Zealand. </p> <p>Islam's own mechanically controlled camera searches Harrison's workshop, the camera movement spelling out the word CINEMATOGRAPHY as it works its way around the space, scanning shelves and stairs, a man at his workbench, tangles of cable and satisfying piles of hardware, all to the sound of whirring motors. The changes of pace and atmosphere in each of these works are impressive; Islam's real purpose is to talk about looking itself, about the mechanisms of film and the eye's desire - to look, to see, to possess, to enter the image. </p> <p>A 40-minute film of a lecture given at Tate Modern and the Guggenheim museum in New York dominates Mark Leckey's show. Leckey, suave in evening dress, delivers his peroration on images and objects, on Philip Guston's \"thick-as-a-brick\" paintings, on deformed feet in Georg Baselitz, on cats, on James Cameron's movie Titanic, on Marx's \"All that is solid melts into air\", and a great deal more. Like Macuga, Leckey often co-opts other artists into his work. A compelling and plausible speaker, he is by turns erudite and iconoclastic, and a bit too slick - too much the performer to be utterly believable. This is a risk lecturers often run. The camera drifts in and out of the proceedings. I find myself taking notes. What we are watching is a \"cinema in the round\", just like that fish-eye view of Leckey's studio reflected in the bulging steel surfaces of Jeff Koons' Bunny - an image that appears in Leckey's 2004 film Made in 'Eaven. The world is full of distorted reflections and false images.</p> <p>Leckey is currently a professor of film studies at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt, where Daniel Birnbaum, one of this year's Turner prize judges, is director (and where, I might add, two earlier Turner prize winners are also professors). I have never warmed to Leckey's art until now. What I like here are the busy conjunctions of slide projections, films and models (including one of his studio), and the daring of his cinema-in-the-round, its range and humour - though it lacks Islam's sophistication, Macuga's reticence, Wilkes' directness. </p> <p>But I'm not entirely convinced by Leckey or Wilkes, who seems to me to fall for the obvious too often. Who should win the Turner prize? What do we want from art? These are the questions, and they may be incompatible. Macuga has the best installation here, but, as a body of work, the films of Islam take a lot of beating.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The <strong>Turner prize </strong>exhibition is at Tate Britain, London SW1, from today until January 18.

  "<p>Lord Justice Scott Baker has had a distinguished career in the law. Coming from a legal family, he now sits as a senior judge in the High Court, with 40 years' experience behind him. Described as shrewd and unflappable, the silver-haired 71-year-old was praised for his fair handling of the inquest, earlier this year, into the death of Princess Diana. </p> <p>Outside the courts, he spent 14 years helping to run a private prep school in Buckinghamshire and for much of that time was the chairman of the board of governors. </p> <p>But now it is being alleged that he and the headmaster mishandled a case of alleged sexual abuse of a boy at the school by a teacher. </p> <p>Both men appear to have broken the school's policy by failing to report the alleged abuse to social services or to the police for the case to be investigated. </p> <p>The abuse is alleged to have happened at the Caldicott prep school near Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. The school, for 240 boys aged seven to 13, benefits from 40 acres of grounds and playing fields. Most boys go on to to elite schools such as Harrow and Eton. Its old boys include Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader.</p> <p>For obvious reasons, the boy cannot be identified and we will call him John. He is suffering psychological problems and has been receiving counselling.</p> <p>The school is also alleged to have withheld important information in an earlier court case, which will feature tonight in a television documentary. </p> <p>At the heart of the new allegation is a policy that Caldicott adopted in 2000. In a letter to Whitehall's education department, the school pledged that it would change its procedures \"to cover investigations by police and or social services in cases of suspected abuse\". </p> <p>In the letter seen by the Guardian the school promised that \"any member of staff suspected of child abuse will immediately be suspended from duty pending further investigation by the police or social services\".</p> <p>The incident involving John is alleged to have happened in the early 2000s, late one night in the boy's dormitory. The next morning, John reported the allegation to the headmaster, Simon Doggart, who immediately told Baker.</p> <p>Doggart spoke to the father of the boy and it was agreed that the boy should write a statement of what had happened. </p> <p>The head arranged for the boy to meet his tutor and the school's bursar, whom Doggart says was considered to be reasonably independent as he was not a teacher nor part of the accused teacher's circle.</p> <p>The boy wrote a statement in the head's study in the presence of these two men.</p> <p>The boy's father says that he agreed that his son should give a written report of the incident, but says that in retrospect, the way it was done was \"woefully inadequate\" as his son was not given any counselling or representation for the meeting. </p> <p>He says that the statement was taken down in a \"tense, if not hostile, environment\" and so his son gave a \"superficial or watered-down account\". </p> <p>He says it was hardly surprising that a boy would be \"reluctant to go into graphic details of the extent of the abuse in the presence of at least one person with whom he was not familiar\". He says a more detailed account was given later by the boy to his mother.</p> <p>The school says that at the time, the parents did not criticise the way the statement was taken and, as a contemporaneous note taken at the time says, were \"happy for the headmaster to sort it out\".</p> <p>As required under the school's policy, the teacher had been suspended quickly after the incident, and he did not return. However, the school did not report the allegation to the police or social services.</p> <p>The school argues that this was not done because both parents had adamantly insisted on several occasions that the allegation should not be reported to the social services or police, as they wanted to shield their son from any publicity.</p> <p>The school says it did not feel that it should have overruled the strong wishes of the parents. Caldicott adds that its contemporaneous records \"show quite clearly that the school's actions were determined by the wishes of the parents\".</p> <p>The parents say that at the early stages of the issue, they were not informed by the headmaster or Scott Baker that it was Caldicott's policy to report such allegations to social services or the police. </p> <p>They add - crucially in their minds - that the school did not tell them that their son's anonymity was assured if social services or the police were called in. </p> <p>The father says: \"Unaware of the fact that reporting to police and social services would protect my son's anonymity, I was desperate that the events should not be disclosed or reported to other parties for the simple reason of protecting my son.\"</p> <p>Donald Findlater, of the child protection charity Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said allegations should be forwarded to police or social services, two independent bodies with expertise in investigating child abuse, because schools are not equipped to conduct a criminal inquiry into such claims. </p> <p>He added that in recent years, regulations covering schools have been tightened up. At the time of the incident, schools were not automatically required to inform the police or social services. Now schools are advised by the government that any allegation should be examined objectively by someone independent of the school.</p> <p>A few days after the incident, the parents met the headmaster to discuss it. The school's notes of the meeting record that the parents said their child \"had been very frightened\" and was \"now very calm\". Another meeting was held with Scott Baker a few months later, at which the judge said there was no evidence the teacher had abused other boys.</p> <p>The school's governing body considered the incident when it met two months after it happened.</p> <p>According to the minutes, the parents had \"initially been content with the action taken by the school\" but were \"unhappy with some aspects of the incident\".</p> <p>Scott Baker told the meeting that although there was no legal obligation for the school to take any further action, \"there was, he believed, a moral obligation. The action would be to report the matter to the Department for Education and Employment [DfEE] and or to social services.\"</p> <p>\"The parents do not wish any further action to be taken and did not wish their son to be subjected to a further ordeal. In particular, they did not wish their son identified to any outside body\". </p> <p>One member of the board is recorded as saying that social services \"should definitely be consulted\". The minutes record that Scott Baker \"reminded\" the board that the boy's father was \"adamant that he did not wish his son to be further disturbed or identified as a result of this incident\".</p> <p>After a long discussion, the majority of the board \"agreed that the allegation should be reported to the DfEE or to social services\".</p> <p>Caldicott did not notify social services. It did make a full disclosure to the DfEE, which is responsible for warning other employers that a teacher has been accused or convicted of abusing children.</p> <p>Ten months after the alleged assault, the parents told the school that their son was \"now prepared to be interviewed by the appropriate authorities\". The school informed the DfEE of this development. </p> <p>However, the allegation did not reach the police until at least a year after that, reported not by the school, but by another, unknown source. The police investigated and interviewed John and, after a year, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was not enough evidence to start a prosecution. </p> <p>The parents believe that the delay reduced the chances of gaining a conviction - a suggestion rejected by Caldicott. The school reiterated that the delay was \"unlikely\" to have made a difference and in any case there was a \"lack of conclusive evidence\" against the teacher. </p> <p>The parents also point to a series of incidents which they believe show that the school trivalised the allegation. These claims are rejected by Caldicott. </p> <p>Questions have also been raised about the school's handling of earlier abuse allegations that have been levelled against Peter Wright, Caldicott's headmaster between 1968 and 1993.</p> <p>He has been accused of sexually abusing boys aged 11 to 14 at the school between 1964 and 1970 while he was a teacher and then headmaster. </p> <p>Wright denied the allegations and asserted that he never had any sexual interest in boys. When the case came to court in 2003, the judge stayed the prosecution as he concluded that Wright, then 73, would not get a fair trial because of the three-decade delay. The allegations had not been reported by the former pupils to the police until 2001.</p> <p>Judge Roger Connor told the court that the school had refused to provide potentially important information to Wright - one of a number of reasons for staying the prosecution. The school rejects the allegation, saying that it did offer to give Wright information - lists of former boys who could be called as witnesses - but the offer was never taken up. The judge \"appears to have been misled\", the school added. </p> <p>Tonight, in a television documentary on More4, three former Caldicott pupils movingly describe how they were groomed and then regularly abused at the school in the 1960s and 1970s. Martin Carson, a teacher who had abused one of the boys, was jailed in 2003 for child abuse offences. Two of them did not tell anyone about the abuse for more than 30 years and suffered severe depression. </p> <p>One of them, Tom Perry, is now campaigning to spread the message that every parent should scrutinise a school's child protection procedures to ensure the safety of their offspring. This, he says, is as important as other factors such as league tables and catchment areas.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> True Stories: Chosen, by True Vision Productions, will be shown tonight at 10pm on More4.

  "<p>John Troyer, a newly arrived scholar at the University of Bath's Centre for Death and Society, dug up evidence of a little-unappreciated gap in the law. His study, called Abuse of a Corpse: A Brief History and Re-Theorisation of Necrophilia Laws in the USA, appears in the only-occasionally-ghoulish journal Mortality.</p> <p>Troyer spotlights an incident that frustrated the police and the courts of one American state. He writes: \"In September 2006, Wisconsin police discovered Nicholas Grunke, Alexander Grunke and Dustin Radtke digging into the grave of a recently deceased woman. Upon questioning by police, Alexander Grunke explained that the three men wanted to exhume the body for sexual intercourse. In the Wisconsin state court system, the three men were charged with attempted third-degree sexual assault and attempted theft. None of the men could be charged with attempted necrophilia, since the state of Wisconsin has no law making necrophilia illegal. </p> <p>\"What the Wisconsin case exposed was the following gap in US jurisprudence: many states have no law prohibiting necrophilia.\"</p> <p>Troyer sketches the court's dilemma: \"Since [the victim] was already dead at the time of the alleged crime and therefore no longer a person before the law, her body was legally recognised as human remains and not as a victim ... Nicholas Grunke, Alexander Grunke and Dustin Radtke were then charged with the remaining illegal acts, namely, damage to cemetery property and attempted theft of movable property, a category that included [the victim's] corpse. What shocked many of the case's observers was that even if the three men had actually succeeded in taking the body from the grave, they could have only been charged with theft of private property since [the victim's] post-mortem body belonged to her parents.\"</p> <p>On March 5, 2008, the Wisconsin Supreme Court heard oral arguments as to how it might overcome the legal lacunae.

The UK, especially, gives it special focus. Section 70 of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act is entitled Sexual Penetration of a Corpse. Section 70 explicitly, very explicitly, prohibits only the most canonical form of necrophilia. Troyer notes that \"UK law seems to preclude other sexual acts [Troyer lists several of them] from being considered criminal.\"</p> <p>The niceties of the law, especially those pertaining to uncommon activities, suffer a reputation for being abstruse, boring, dull. But Troyer has unearthed an exception. As his study points out: \"Necrophilia is that rare kind of sexual deviancy that truly captures public attention with its abject perversity and titillating, lascivious details.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize.

  "<p>In <strong>Breaking Bad </strong>(FX), Bryan Cranston shows us the dark side of the comic Everyman - or Everydad - he played in Malcolm in the Middle. As Walter White, a teacher of chemistry to disaffected high-schoolers by day and, even less rewardingly, a carwash clerk by night, Walt looks free, but everywhere he is in chains. Tiny, veggie rasher-shaped chains.</p> <p>The hammer blow of being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer liberates him. When he spots a former student escaping from a meth lab during a police raid, Walt tracks him down and becomes his new partner - and possibly the first meth dealer ever to insist on safety equipment and an eyewash station in the cookhouse.</p> <p>Naturally, the teacher's product is first class, and his involvement in the drug world rapidly deepens. By the end of the first episode he has killed two rival dealers and is standing half-naked in the Mexican desert wielding a gun and preparing to face down the police cars he hears approaching. They turn out to be fire trucks and Walt lives to fight another of the approximately 724 days he has left.</p> <p>Breaking Bad is a curious beast, but brilliant. For all the explosions and car chases, it has an underlying intelligence and melancholia that give it unexpected heft. And while it grapples with big questions - how a death sentence can set you free, how you earn respect in a world that esteems only money - the detail is never overlooked. Walt's wife serves him bacon arranged into a '50' on top of his eggs on his birthday. And it's veggie bacon. His diagnosis is delivered by a doctor with a small spot of mustard on his coat. That's life, that is: spotted with disappointment, and even the most promising-looking bits of it never quite live up to expectations. Walt, you feel, has waited long enough for the universe to cut him a break. Watching him break back is going to be fun.</p>",
  "<p>As the financial vortex sucks down Washington Mutual and Bradford &amp; Bingley, Ann Pettifor reminds us that the $700bn about to be thrown in by the US government will only be a brick in a tottering tower of debt (Reports, September 29; Comment, September 19). With both Gordon Brown and Henry Paulson long ignoring the most grotesque credit bubble in history until Northern Wreck, we need to ask: how safe is our financial system in their hands? </p> <p>We need a financial system that works for us all, not just for the freeloading plutocrats who are robbing us through fraud, speculation and asset fire sales. The financial system should be stewarded as a socially maintained commons, not a private enclosure for the banksters. And, as this meltdown is systemic, we now need a just, equitable, transparent financial sector that serves people and businesses while respecting the planet. We don't need a new Bretton Woods on the back of a fag packet, driven through in a panic so as to keep enriching the few.<br><strong>Martin Large </strong><br>Stroud, Gloucester </p> <p>The crisis facing capitalists - banks or in the high street - is presented as a crisis for the British people as a whole. </p> <p>In fact, as a society, we do not need to continue to buy tat from identical high street shops, nor to employ more workers in the glorified casinos banks have become. We do need teachers to reduce the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Europe, carers to give elderly the dignity they need, workers to research and build renewable energy sources, mental health nurses and workers throughout the public sector. The huge amounts of our money now being ploughed into bail-outs are equally available to be used for the benefit of society as a whole. <br><strong>Ruth Knox </strong><br>Liverpool</p> <p>In the days when a financial institution was owned by its partners rather than by a company, the partners had a strong personal interest in avoiding rash business practice. If their firm failed, their personal fortunes went with it. The decline of partnership and the increase in limited liability companies in the City throughout the 20th century eroded this principle. If a company becomes insolvent, neither its directors nor shareholders are directly liable for its debts. </p> <p>The news media have lately lost the habit of distinguishing between true firms (partnerships) and companies, calling all \"firms\". The Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 created LLPs and helped professionals to give their firms limited liability status, largely freeing the partners from personal liability.

  "<p>It was a Mrs Merton-type moment. \"So, Danny, what exactly persuaded you to do a bedroom photoshoot with three naked models?\" It now emerges, however, that Cipriani's decision to pose for the provocative shots in Observer Sports Monthly was inspired by Pierce Brosnan and a desire to promote rugby union. </p> <p>\"I was a bit wary but they said it was something Pierce Brosnan had done years ago,\" he said. \"There was a bit of class about it and I stressed it couldn't be done a certain way. Yeah, it's a different type of shoot but I'm trying to show there's a different side to rugby. I'm not trying to be portrayed in any sort of way, it's just me really. It was a nice piece.

  "<p>Adam Lallana first came to my attention more by coincidence than judgment after I had been released by Bournemouth and went to see how they were getting on without me. He was on loan from Southampton, playing in a withdrawn striking role, and I couldn't fail to be impressed by his ability on the ball. But for all his neat touches and good movement, very little was made of his skill in the game.</p> <p>It was with this thought in mind that I took a trip to QPR to see him play and was rewarded with a performance full of promise. He played in a right-sided midfield berth, which slightly surprised me, but he was never going to be tied down to playing out wide. In a side determined to get the ball and play, this free spirit fitted in very nicely.</p> <p>He is a good, well-rounded player capable of playing in many different positions which can be an advantage but might also see him cast in the utility role which at times can be frustrating.</p> <p>He started the game quietly as Southampton struggled to come to terms with their physical opponents and went a goal down within a minute. However, as they started to gain a foothold, he announced himself with a marvellous run from his own half, drifting past two players and playing a neat one-two to take him to the edge of the box, where he hit a left-foot drive which the goalkeeper did well to save.</p> <p>His touch was excellent under pressure and he took up some good positions in space when offering himself as an option to a team-mate on the ball, particularly by coming inside and making an extra man in central midfield. By doing this he allowed his full-back to overlap but he also gave the width Southampton needed when coming inside wasn't an option. </p> <p>Lallana scored a super equaliser after he had picked the ball up wide and played another one-two to go clear of his marker. He then drove at the QPR defence and, linking up well with two team-mates, emerged with the ball eight yards from goal to finish neatly into the bottom corner. We then saw him at his best with some excellent work on the ball, culminating in a wonderful piece of skill on the byline which left two QPR defenders trailing in his wake. </p> <p>He has had every advantage a young player could want early in his career after an incredibly successful time in Southampton's youth team, reaching the final and semi-final of the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons.</p> <p>This brought him to the attention of the England Under-18 manager for whom he scored on his debut and he has now become a regular in Southampton's youthful first-team this year, having recently signed a new three-year contract after being linked with moves to Fulham and Tottenham.</p> <p>He has clearly been brought up to play the game the way it should be played. My only concern is whether he'll be as effective when he is asked to play a more rigid position. But for now he is in the right place at the right time because the way Southampton play, Lallana and Saints are a match made in heaven.</p> <p><strong>Age </strong>20</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> St Albans</p> <p><strong>Position </strong>Midfield</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>5ft 9in </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 11st 6lb</p> <p><strong>From </strong>Trainee</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>8/10 </p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>7/10</p> <p><strong>Passing </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>9/10 </p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 8/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a31m</p>",
  "<p>The next set of potential future doctors, dentists and vets are about to collate all their aims and ambitions on their online Ucas application ready for the deadline of October 15. Sounds straightforward enough? Sadly not when stringent academic requirements, relevant work experience and admissions tests enter the equation. So what makes a strong application for these competitive courses?</p> <p>First, your academic profile needs to be extremely strong - plenty of As and A*s at GCSE and As at AS-level won't go amiss. </p> <p>Next, your personal statement. Even if selectors do look at your grades first, your 500-word justification of your choice will play an important part. Here you must show you have researched both the course and study demands, as well as understanding the career and what it will entail. </p> <p>Throughout, it's your motivation that counts. Perhaps the most crucial thing is evidence of practical work experience, be it in a hospital, dentist or vets. </p> <p>Without this, it's highly likely your application will quickly find the reject pile. Unfortunately, unless you are applying for medicine at Bristol, Birmingham or Liverpool, you have to take an admissions test. For Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, UCL and the Royal Veterinary College this will be the Bmat test, for all the others Ukcat. Instigated recently, these tests are controversial among both applicants and advisers. </p> <p>The Ukcat test, which costs \u00a375, is designed to be a test of aptitude rather than academic achievement. For some universities, it plays a small part in the admissions process; for others, a much more crucial role. The deadline for registering was September 26. You get your result on the day and include it on your Ucas application. </p> <p>Bmat consists of three sections: aptitude and skills, scientific knowledge and application, and a writing task. The test date is November 5 2008 and costs \u00a331. Results are published in early December.</p> <p>Although the stated intention is that you cannot revise for these tests, the marketplace is full of books, websites and courses to help you prepare. Most will cost you additional money. Three vital - and free - pieces of advice:</p> <p>1. Pace yourself correctly</p> <p>2. Check the sites for sample questions and tests - become familiar with the style</p> <p>3. Practise!</p> <p>It's worth mentioning extended medicine degrees, which feature an extra year's study and usually do not have such high exam entry requirements. Clearly not all suitable future doctors, vets and dentists have A grades across the board and some unis are recognising this. Three to mention are King's, East Anglia and Southampton. </p> <p>You are allowed four choices only for these courses. Should you use them all? What to put down as the fifth choice? General points to remember are:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Think seriously about the extra choices, given the mega competition.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't go for something just as tough eg pharmacy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You can add additional choices later if unsure at this stage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't worry that your statement is all about medicine.</p> <p>For every nine applications for medicine, there's just one place.

  "<p>Anglo-American finance ministers and central bankers, like little Dutch boys, try desperately to plug leaks in the bursting dyke that is the international financial system. In the US, treasury secretary Hank Paulson hoped for $700bn to plug the gaping hole in Wall Street's banks. In the UK, the government is not just plugging holes, but setting aside competition rules to encourage the monopolisation of finance. Alistair Darling suspended competition rules to allow the Lloyds Bank takeover of HBOS because of the crisis. This is like suspending the law during hurricanes. The demise of another independent bank, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and the transfer of its savings business to Santander, will increasingly monopolise finance. </p> <p>Will these plugs and private-sector fixes work? No, because a) they are not system-wide fixes and b) they are based on the same flawed economic policies that spurred this crisis in the first place. </p> <p>Some of these policies, attributable to Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, are already discredited. Contempt for government is no longer acceptable. Using fiscal policies to bail out banks is now sanctioned by all political parties. To refuse to use fiscal policies to bail out taxpayers who lose pensions, homes and jobs, will make political parties unelectable. </p> <p>But there are other orthodox economic policies that remain intact and are as yet unchallenged by any political party. The most damaging is orthodox monetary policy. This is based on the assumption that money is a commodity, and that its \"price\" - the rate of interest - must be set by supply and demand for money in private markets for capital - just as the price of oil is set by supply and demand for oil. </p> <p>This is a nonsense. We do not dig capital out of the ground, nor does it grow on trees. Money is man-made. Interest rates are a social construct. And as such, unlike oil or soya beans, \"there are no intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of capital\", as Keynes argued in the General Theory. Because there is no reason for the scarcity of capital, there is no reason for the price of capital to be high. </p> <p>And yet the private finance sector has succeeded in creating a shortage of capital, the credit crunch, and - at the height of a debt crisis - ratchets its price ever upwards. The rate for private inter-bank loans (Libor) continues to move upwards as the crisis worsens. </p> <p>The private finance sector also requires that central banks maintain official, or base rates at current levels by adhering to a policy esoterically named \"inflation targeting\". In fact these high rates, by making debts unpayable, lead to rapid de-leveraging of debts (think bank failures) and assets (think property price falls) and are dangerously deflationary. </p> <p>Flawed monetary policies are turning a crisis into a catastrophe. They must be challenged. Keynes's cool, rational voice on monetary theory and monetary policy must once again be heeded. Central banks must once again take control over all rates - short and long, safe and risky. </p> <p>But a system-wide fix would go further. It would challenge the orthodoxy that unemployment helps keep wages low and is a good thing; and that wage rises are always inflationary. It is this orthodoxy that has caused wages and other forms of compensation to fall as a share of GDP in all OECD countries over the past three decades. This fall in compensation has forced people to supplement incomes by borrowing more. </p> <p>Creating jobs and raising incomes as a share of GDP is vital if we want people to repay debts, salvage banks and return to the high street. If we fail to adopt such system-wide fixes, and if we persist with economic orthodoxy, then look forward to a prolonged period of global economic failure.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.debtonation.org\">debtonation.org</a></p>",
  "<p>No corkscrew. That's the first surprise about Chechnya. Unlike in Baghdad today or Kabul during the Soviet occupation, planes don't arrive high above the airfield and then dip one wing in a steep and terrifying spiral so as to reduce the risk of ground fire as they land. In Grozny they glide in over woods and villages, apparently confident there are no resistance fighters lurking in wait.</p> <p>Surprise number two is the amount of reconstruction in the Chechen capital. Five years ago when I last visited Grozny it still looked like the ruins of Dresden or Hiroshima, street after devastated street. Now new nine-storey blocks of flats, shops, and cafes flank the main streets. In the central square workers are laying the last paving stones outside what is described as Europe's largest mosque, a concrete replica of Istanbul's Blue Mosque, financed and largely built with Turkish aid and Turkish engineers.</p> <p>Tall, white concrete fences link the new flats, designed to conceal the waste ground, wrecked buildings and bomb craters full of weeds behind them. But the scale and speed of the rebuilding effort are remarkable, a tribute to the Kremlin's determination to spend huge chunks of its oil revenues on getting Chechnya \"normalised\". It is nine years since Russian troops recaptured Grozny in the second Chechen war but it's only during the year and a bit since Ramzan Kadyrov, Moscow's current favourite, became president that money has been lavished in effective quantities. </p> <p>New too is the disappearance of Russian army and interior ministry troops from the streets, a pattern of declining visibility which the Americans have started to emulate in Baghdad. The Russians retain bases and barracks near the airport and elsewhere on Grozny's outskirts but security is in the hands of Kadyrov's Chechen forces. Highways which used to be dotted with Russian checkpoints are open and unpatrolled. </p> <p>Like it or not, Russia has won this war. It is rare for foreign occupiers to defeat a nationalist insurgency supported by a majority ethnic community. Think Vietnam and Algeria for dramatic cases of failure. Britain's performance in Malaya, touted at West Point, Sandhurst and other war colleges as a textbook success, depended on the insurgents being from the country's Chinese minority. </p> <p>Like most observers, I never expected Russia to reach this point, especially after its apparent victory in the first Chechen war in 1996 crumbled overnight when the guerrillas infiltrated Grozny and launched a mass uprising. But Putin is not Yeltsin. He has played a long game, and even spokesmen for the remaining opposition activists with whom I have talked outside Russia accept the war is over, at least for this generation. \"There is no current scope for combined national resistance, and we don't want warlordism like with the 'Forest Brethren' in postwar Ukraine,\" one said, referring to the armed bands of nationalists who fought Soviet rule for a decade after the second world war.</p> <p>Russia's Chechen success has come at a terrible human price through massive fire power, torture of suspected insurgents, targeted assassination of guerrilla leaders, and subtle manipulation of money and amnesty offers. Moscow also exploited and deepened the divisions within the Chechen national movement. Ramzan Kadyrov's father was a moderate Islamist who fought the Russians in the first Chechen war, but switched sides in 2000 in opposition to the Wahhabism that was gaining ground over the secularists in the insurgency.</p> <p>Pictures of Ramzan - as he is universally called - adorn the walls of public buildings throughout Grozny. \"Happiness in the service of the people\" says one of him, in Saddam Hussein proportions, on the airport terminal. </p> <p>His compound near Gudermes sports an artificial lake, a Disneyworld-style fibreglass mountain, and a collection of panthers and leopards which, he says, he finds relaxing to watch after a hard day's work. But with his moon face and wispy reddish hair, the 30-year-old president cuts an unexpectedly modest figure. This is no strutting dictator in dark glasses surrounded by gun-toting bodyguards, even though his opponents say he has created an unprecedented climate of terror in which no one dares to criticise him. </p> <p>Kadyrov's language can certainly be blunt. Talking of Shamil Basayev, who masterminded the Beslan school siege, he told a group of journalists last week that he once shared a room with Basayev and quickly realised he was an opportunist with no real beliefs. \"I was delighted when I heard he had been killed, then sad because I wanted to kill him myself,\" he told us with no hint of a smile.</p> <p>The biggest irony is Kadyrov's unstinting praise for Russia. Since the Tsarist incursions in the 19th century, no people in the Caucasus have fought the Russians so fiercely or suffered so much. Yet now Chechnya's president boasts of having sent Chechen troops into South Ossetia alongside the Russians. \"Chechen never wanted a separate state. We have shown we will stay in the Russian Federation,\" he said.</p> <p>Some analysts say Kadyrov may secretly plan to ask the Russians to leave once their money has armed and trained his forces and rebuilt the republic. His opponents laugh at this, saying he is totally dependent on the Kremlin and they have other Chechens in Moscow to replace him if necessary.</p> <p>So where does that leave the dreams of Chechen independence? On ice but not abandoned, say the nationalist exiles who were always as unhappy about imported Wahhabism as the Kremlin is. They cite two factors for optimism. Yeltsin's bombing, followed by Putin's war, forced Russia's huge civilian population to flee Chechnya. \"The settlers have gone. Now there are only occupiers,\" as one put it. Then there is the new diaspora. \"Thank God the Arab countries never took Chechens in as refugees. They're safe from Islamic influence. Chechens all go to the west, mainly to Europe. They are getting education, and one day they'll be ready to go back,\" the exile added. </p> <p>By coincidence, his second point was also made by Kadyrov in our meeting. Whether the diaspora is ready to return as long as its leader is so slavishly wedded to Moscow remains to be seen. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Angry Republican leaders blamed Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, last night for shattering a mood of bipartisan cooperation and destroying the US government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">$700bn financial bail-out package</a>.</p> <p>Keen to shake off responsibility for failing to deliver votes from their own members, embarrassed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> said a feisty speech by Pelosi had been so offensive that some of their number shifted sides and voted against the plan at the last moment.</p> <p>\"I do believe we could have got there today, had it not been for this partisan speech that the Speaker gave on the floor of the House,\" said John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House.</p> <p>A 68-year-old San Francisco liberal, Pelosi is known for being outspoken: in the past, she has raised eyebrows by bluntly describing George Bush as \"incompetent\".</p> <p>In her speech to the House yesterday, she delivered a broadside against seven years of \"budgetary recklessness\" by the White House for creating America's economic mess.</p> <p>\"When was the last time someone asked you for $700bn?\" she asked. </p> <p>\"It is a number that is staggering, but tells us only the costs of the Bush administration's failed economic policies - policies built on budgetary recklessness, on an anything goes mentality with no regulation, no supervision and no discipline in the system.\"</p> <p>Pulling few punches, Pelosi said her party believed in the free market - but the market had \"created chaos\" because it had been left entirely to its own devices.</p> <p>\"It is our responsibility today to help avert that catastrophic outcome,\" she said.</p> <p>Pelosi is the third most senior politician in the US, ranking behind the vice-president, Dick Cheney, in the line of succession for the presidency.</p> <p>An Italian-American mother of five and a grandmother of six, she is the first woman to have held the office of Speaker.</p> <p>She is disliked by many on the right who view her as the essence of California liberalism: pro-choice, pro-gay and anti-war.</p> <p>But others say that since taking office when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/democrats\">Democrats</a> took control of Congress two years ago, she has shown notes of moderation by consistently blocking efforts to impeach Bush.</p> <p>Railing against her words yesterday, the Republican whip, Eric Cantor, said Pelosi had \"frankly struck a tone of partisanship that was inappropriate in this discussion\". He continued: \"There is a reason that this vote failed - and that is Speaker Pelosi's speech.\"</p> <p>A fellow Republican, Roy Blunt, suggested that a dozen congressmen from his own party had changed their minds after hearing Pelosi's words.</p> <p>But the Speaker was quickly backed by her colleagues who accused Republicans of casting around for a scapegoat to cover their own humiliation in being defied by two-thirds of their own party.</p> <p>\"I'm appalled that because somebody hurt their feelings, they decided to punish the entire country,\" said Barney Frank, Democratic chairman of the House financial services committee. </p> <p>\"I would not have imputed that degree of pettiness and hyper-sensitivity.\"</p> <p>Rahm Emmanuel, chairman of the Democratic caucus in the House, said nobody should be \"pointing fingers\" given the seriousness of the economic warnings descending upon Congress.</p> <p>The outbreak of hostilities came after a weekend of rare cooperation in which leaders from both parties burned midnight oil in an attempt to strike a deal which could be supported by their backbenchers.</p> <p>At one stage late on Saturday night, the two parties met in Pelosi's office over a platter of pizza and sandwiches to try to come to agreement.</p> <p>To many observers, Republicans appeared to be the architects of yesterday's defeat. </p> <p>Some 60% of Democrats voted for the bail-out, compared with only a third of the Republicans in Congress. But Pelosi was not the only person whom rightwingers attempted to blame.</p> <p>On the presidential campaign trail, John McCain said that it was time to \"fix the problem\" rather than apportion responsibility. But his chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, accused Barack Obama of failing to get involved in negotiations to fashion an acceptable package.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama failed to lead, phoned it in, attacked John McCain, and refused to even say if he supported the bill,\" said Holtz-Eakin.</p> <p>The Obama campaign reacted with irritation. A spokesman for Obama said the Republicans' \"angry and hyper-partisan\" utterances were exactly why Americans are \"disgusted with Washington\".</p> <p>\"Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans to join together and act in a way that prevents an economic catastrophe,\" Obama's camp said.</p>",
  "<p>Pregnancy is not always the preserve of the healthy glow. Despite attempting to stay healthy by eating the right foods and exercising, many women find they spend much of the nine months warding off niggling ailments. Compromised natural defences - the immune system undergoes significant changes to allow a woman's body to tolerate the foetus that would otherwise be considered a foreign object - means that succumbing to colds, coughs and other complaints is commonplace. But with many medications considered unsafe, working out what you can and cannot take to aid recovery is problematic. </p> <p>Last week, a US study led to renewed calls for pregnant women to be vaccinated against the influenza virus and a separate report warned that women at risk of giving birth prematurely should not be given antibiotics as it increases the risk of the child having cerebral palsy. So what should you take? Here we look at the best routes to avoiding and treating illness:</p> <h2>Flu</h2> <p>Because of their compromised immune systems, pregnant women are more likely to catch the influenza virus than other women. Following new evidence in the New England Journal of Medicine last week, the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI), a government advisory panel, are calling for all pregnant women to be offered the flu jab. Professor Mark Steinhoff, from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore randomly assigned 340 women to have the flu vaccine while pregnant. He found approximately one-third fewer cases of flu in mothers who had had the jab, as well as in their newborn babies. The study also found that the babies whose mothers had been vaccinated were 63% less likely to catch the virus during the first six months of their lives - a significant figure as the risks of complications including bronchitis and pneumonia are greater in infants under six months, who are too young be vaccinated. The flu vaccination is considered safe to take during pregnancy and is already routinely given to pregnant women in the US and Canada.</p> <p><strong>What to do: </strong>The Department of Health advises women not to panic. At present, the vaccination programme recommends flu jabs for only at-risk groups such as those with diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic heart disease, although the department says it is keeping this under review. If you do get flu while pregnant, the advice from NHS Direct is to drink plenty of water, take paracetamol to treat a high temperature, headache and muscle pain but only to take over-the-counter medications after consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Generally, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (such as ibuprofen) should be avoided, particularly in the third trimester.</p> <h2>Tonsilitis and bacterial infections</h2> <p>Although bacterial infections, such as tonsilitis, are generally treatable with antibiotics, doctors are now being warned not to prescribe the medication to women at risk of premature labour as it may increase the chance of their babies getting cerebral palsy. Last week it was announced that the Department of Health had written to doctors about the risks following a study designed to look into the effect of antibiotics on premature births. Dr Sara Kenyon of Leicester University, who led the study, found that erythromycin and another antibiotic called co-amoxiclav appeared to have harmful effects for some children born to mothers in premature labour whose waters had not broken. When the children were re-assessed at seven, those born to mothers who had taken antibiotics were likely to have cerebral palsy.</p> <p><strong>What to do: </strong>Despite this latest study, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists insists most pregnant women showing signs of infection can be treated promptly and safely with antibiotics. Kenyon says, \"Where there is an obvious infection, antibiotics should be prescribed because they could be life-saving for mother and baby.\" With tonsilitis, paracetamol can also be taken to bring down temperature and taking warm drinks, soft food and throat lozenges or boiled sweets can help to ease swallowing.</p> <h2>Coughs and colds</h2> <p>During pregnancy, many women find they suffer a constant stream of niggling coughs and colds. Remedies often contain several active ingredients, including painkillers, antihistamines and decongestants, which pregnant women are urged to avoid. Cough medicines containing iodine as an expectorant should not be taken, as this might impair the functioning of a baby's thyroid gland.</p> <p><strong>What to do: </strong>Drinking plenty of water or warm drinks can help to relieve a chesty cough and inhaling steam can help to loosen mucus. 'Although there is no confirmed evidence that vitamin C reduces the duration or intensity of a cold, there is no harm in taking the recommended daily allowance of 40mg if you think it helps,\" says Louise Sutton, a dietician at Leeds Metropolitan University. \"However, taking more than this is inadvisable as it can cause diarrhoea and tummy ache.\" Some soothing cough mixtures such as linctus are safe, but check with your pharmacist.</p> <h2>Constipation</h2> <p>About 40% of women experience constipation during pregnancy. It is thought raised levels of the female hormone progesterone act as a relaxant to the intestinal muscles - causing food and waste to move slower through the system - combined with the pressure from the expanding uterus. Iron tablets prescribed for anaemia may also contribute. </p> <p><strong>What to do: </strong>\"Try drinking more fluids and eating more high-fibre foods, including dried and fresh fruit and wholegrain cereals, before resorting to other measures,\" says Sutton. \"If that doesn't work, lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women - including the bulking agents like lactulose and macrogols. Always ask your pharmacist before taking them as some are not suitable.\"</p> <h2>Headaches and migraines</h2> <p>During pregnancy, these have been shown to decrease in people who usually suffer from them regularly, but not everyone will escape them. </p> <p><strong>What to do: </strong>Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are not recommended during pregnancy as they have been linked to complications in labour. Aspirin can also increase the risk of bleeding in the mother and baby, particularly if taken in the third trimester. Only paracetamol is safe for mild to moderate pain. For migraine sufferers, the advice from The Migraine Trust is \"to take as few drugs as you can and at the lowest effective dose\". Some migraine tablets contain ergotamine which has been shown in trials to stimulate the muscles of the uterus, raising the risk of a miscarriage and the trust says that the use of triptan drugs should be avoided. While paracetamol is safest, it says, your doctor will be able to prescribe a migraine medication suitable for use in the second and third trimesters.</p>",
  "<p>Nine Nobel laureates, including the South African campaigner Desmond Tutu and the German novelist G\u00fcnter Grass, join forces today with more than 100 celebrities from the arts, law and media to protest against the US government's detention of five Cubans for allegedly spying on behalf of the Cuban government.</p> <p>The so-called Miami Five were sentenced in 2001 to prison terms of between 15 and 25 years for allegedly acting as Cuban agents within the exile community in Miami.

  "<p>It is one way of dealing with a suspected criminal. But not the right way, according to Essex police. Officers took a dim view of staff at a flooring company who believed a colleague was stealing from the firm.</p> <p>The staff took matters into their own hands, forcing Mark Gilbert to walk through the town of Witham on Friday with his hands tied behind his back, wearing a sign around his neck saying: \"Thief. I stole \u00a3845. Am on my way to police station.\"</p> <p>Gilbert was marched to the police station, where he and his captors, from In-House Flooring, were arrested. The men who had tied Gilbert up were arrested for false imprisonment. </p> <p>An Essex police spokesman said: \"A 39-year-old man from Colchester has been arrested on suspicion of theft. </p> <p>\"A 44-year-old man from Halsted and a 22-year-old man from Witham were arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment, assault and theft.\" </p> <p>On Saturday, a 41-year-old man from Maldon and a 42-year-old from Colchester were arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment. </p> <p>All of the arrested men have been released on police bail until November 27.

Most people would have been shocked by what they saw.</p> <p>\" I think this type of thing is unlikely to happen again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, said yesterday she would fight to win back voters in time for next year's general election, following a setback for a conservative sister party in regional elections.</p> <p>Merkel, whose chances of re-election may be in doubt after the Christian Social Union (CSU) lost its absolute majority in Bavaria for the first time in almost half a century, said German voters were not being given enough reassurance at a time of global financial turmoil.</p> <p>\"At this moment in time what's most important is to give people support in the age of globalisation,\" she said, her disappointment obvious during a brief appearance before reporters after the CSU's poor result on Sunday in Germany's most populous and prosperous state. </p> <p>The CSU saw its support drop by 17 percentage points to 43% - its worst result since 1954.</p> <p>Traditionally, Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has benefited from its allies' strong backing in Bavaria at general elections but that support base has been greatly weakened by the CSU's losses.</p> <p>Merkel refused to take the blame for the performance and used the opportunity to call the CDU the \"stability factor\" in her grand coalition with the Social Democrats. But she needs the support of the CSU if she is to win next year's election.</p> <p>The CSU, which was credited with modernising Bavaria, will now have to seek a coalition partner. It has a number to choose from, including the pro-business Free Democrats, which made great strides to secure 8% of the vote and is the most likely candidate; the Greens, which also advanced to a 9.4% share; and the conservative protest party Freie W\u00e4hler (Free Voters), which emerged from nowhere to secure 10.2%. The fledgling political force Die Linke (The Left) failed to secure the 5% necessary to enter parliament.</p> <p>Voters' readiness to shun parties that have long dominated German politics also gave the Social Democrats, which gained no advantage from the CSU's substantial losses, their worst result since 1945 with just 18.6% of the vote. </p> <p>In the Bundesrat, or upper house, Merkel's grand coalition will now have only a wafer-thin majority with which to push through legislation.</p>",
  "<p>Publishers of romances may be used to harsh criticism, but few expect to have their homes firebombed like Martin Rynja this weekend. On Saturday his \u00a32.5m London house was attacked after he agreed to publish a novel about the prophet Muhammad and his wife, Aisha.</p> <p>Billed as a \"love story\" that focuses on how the young Aisha used her wits and courage to gain unprecedented power in the Islamic world, The Jewel of Medina sparked controversy when American academic Denise Spellberg criticised it for being historically inaccurate, and claimed it reduced sacred history to \"softcore pornography\". </p> <p>Author Sherry Jones insists the book is respectful towards Islam. So why do fictional accounts of the prophet provoke such fury?</p> <p>Historically, Muslims are sensitive to the way the prophet has been portrayed in the west. In Dante's Inferno, both the prophet and his son-in-law were firmly in the ninth circle of hell. Meanwhile, the Crusaders sang dirty songs lampooning the prophet and his followers. </p> <p>According to Tim Winter, a lecturer in Islamic studies at Cambridge University, the prophet's sex life has always been a thorny issue. For Christians, Muhammad's marriages proved that Islam allowed sexual licence, so claims that the new book could be pornographic reopen an old wound. </p> <p>Meanwhile Aisha is a particularly controversial figure. She is believed by many Muslims to be a paragon of Islamic virtue, and among the religion's first female leaders. \"In the Islamic tradition Aisha is a model woman, but in The Satanic Verses, Salman Rushdie had the wives of the prophet working in a brothel, with Aisha as the leader.\" </p> <p>Other attacks on the prophet have focused on Aisha's age, which tradition places at nine years old. But the real reason for the current fury is not just historical.</p> <p>\"There is a straightforward reason: people feel a unique distress when their sacred figures are insulted. And some people feel that the west is a civilisation on the rampage and finds Islam to be irksome. There is a sense that the west is in imperial mode and that western writers are cheerleading that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The following clarification was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 18 February 2009. <br>The article above contained a quote saying: \"In The Satanic Verses, Salman Rushdie had the wives of the prophet working in a brothel.\" To clarify: the women are not literally cast in this role; rather, 12 prostitutes adopt the wives' names in a dream sequence.</p>",
  "<p>A prisoner facing questioning in a murder case has been shot dead by a sniper from a hill overlooking his prison in Grenoble, the latest in a series of murders in France's overcrowded prisons. </p> <p>Sghair Lamiri, 29, who was serving an eight-year sentence for armed robbery, was shot by a sniper as he stood in the exercise yard at Varces prison, outside Grenoble, south-east France, on Sunday. Five shots were fired from 300 metres outside the prison. </p> <p>The sniper is 58 and has robbery convictions. \"He denies the facts, but he was caught getting on to a motorbike with false number plates and he had a rifle with telescopic sight, which was still warm,\" said the justice minister, Rachida Dati. </p> <p>Police are linking the shooting to a series of gangland murders and score-settling in Grenoble's underworld of drug-trafficking and organised crime. </p> <p>Staff at the prison have repeatedly warned about the lack of security and illegal objects thrown to prisoners from outside the prison.</p> <p>The shooting has reopened the debate over France's unsafe and overcrowded prisons, which the UN human rights committee and the Council of Europe have criticised as dirty and inhumane.

  "<p>Gosh, George Osborne was shiny. Shiny suit, shiny tie, shiny shoes, shiny face. He radiated inner shininess. But he was also grim. Grim but shiny, a bit like Balsall Heath on a sunny day. He didn't smile once. Every time they applauded he looked more stern and unbending. </p> <p>They said of one Tory MP that his smile was like the silver plate on a coffin. The shadow chancellor's frown was more like a bloodstain on a Christmas cracker.</p> <p>He was beginning to sound like Alistair Darling, who also believes that things can only get grimmer. The message for the Tory conference was: \"We're all doomed! Well, fairly doomed - doomed up to a point.\"</p> <p>But having told us that everything was as bad as it could be, he finished on a note of mad optimism.</p> <p>\"A hard road lies ahead of us. But that hard road leads over the horizon!\" No time to ponder what that might conceivably mean, though I thought he might be about to change into a gingham frock and sing Over The Rainbow.</p> <p>We knew things were desperate because he had assembled a vast collection of soundbites to hurl at the problem. \"The government is all crisis, and no confidence ... Gordon Brown is the candidate of experience. He's going to find that we've all had quite enough of the Gordon Brown experience ... the message to Gordon Brown from the British people is 'Stop! Go!'\"</p> <p>In case we felt he'd not produced substance, he referred to the Tories' leaflet on saving the economy. This is a 40-page document in minuscule type and is impossible to read, like the terms and conditions that come with your credit card, or DVD instructions translated from Japanese by a Swahili speaker. He can be confident very few people will have any idea what's in it. This makes it the ideal political document.</p> <p>But as well as soundbites, Mr Osborne likes to give the conference a delicious sound-mouthful, a political Cadbury's Creme Egg to stuff in their faces. He loves that great wave of applause. It allows him to respond by looking even more grim. Last year it was the reduction in inheritance tax which installed him as Official Conference Darling. Yesterday he promised a two-year freeze on council tax rises. They gasped before they cheered. This from a party that demands more local autonomy. The message from the conference: \"Let local people take local decisions! Provided it doesn't cost us!\"</p> <p>(Actually, a weasly bit came later. \"Every council that takes part ...\" he said. So it's an optional freeze. Like optional taxes, that's quite a risk.)</p> <p>He began his speech by saying that the British people wanted answers to two questions: \"Are you up to it? And will you make a difference?\"</p> <p>We waited with bated tenterhooks to discover the answers. Apparently they are up to it, and they will make a difference! The conference could relax.</p> <p>Until we got on to the doomy bit. \"The credit has dried up. The party is over ... rock-solid banks are blown over like trees.\"</p> <p>If that wasn't enough, if there was anyone cheerful left in the hall, he had more. The cupboard was bare. There was no more money. Borrowing was out of control. \"Labour has done it again!\" </p> <p>They hadn't fixed the roof when the sun was shining. But last week Gordon Brown insisted that's when they had fixed the roof. They were beginning to sound like rival cowboy builders. \"Blimey, who done that roof for you? Worra bodged job ...\"</p> <p>He ended to a standing ovation, and still shiny, but terminally grim, disappeared stage left.</p>",
  "<p>Plans to almost double the number of single rooms in hospitals were unveiled by the Conservatives at their conference in Birmingham yesterday. Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said the Conservatives aimed to increase the number of single rooms in wards by 45,000 in the party's first term in government to nearly 100,000. The proportion of beds in single rooms would increase from 28% to 55%.</p> <p>Under the plan, all maternity and mental health patients would be allocated a single room. Thirty-five per cent of single rooms would go to those admitted to hospital for an operation. </p> <p>The Tories also hope that the increase in single-room allocations will limit the spread of hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA. Single rooms for those who have already contracted such infections will increase by 7%.</p> <p>The move, which would cost \u00a31.57bn over five years - about \u00a3300m a year - would be paid for by reallocating money in the capital funding budget. The Conservatives say last year this budget was underspent by \u00a32.9bn. Lansley said: \"By giving NHS patients the choice of a single room when they book their operation, we will ensure that they will be treated with the dignity they deserve. Any stay in hospital is a traumatic and trying time. We hope that the proposals we are announcing will make a big difference in removing unnecessary stress for patients and their families.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives said the plan was part of a wider shakeup planned for the NHS under which health professionals will be given power to manage their own hospitals and surgeries and will be expected to compete to attract patients. Centrally set targets would go and doctors would reassume control of decision making. Different providers would be encouraged to deliver healthcare, while treatment would remain free at the point of use. Oliver Letwin, the Tory policy chief, said on Sunday night at a fringe event that this was a \"treasured principle\".</p> <p>Labour said all the policies were already current practice. The health minister Ann Keen said: \"There seems to be little new here. The government is already encouraging choice for patients and a diversity of providers within NHS tariffs.</p> <p>\"The real danger for patients is that the Conservatives would scrap the maximum 18-week wait from diagnosis to treatment. They would scrap the four-hour maximum wait in A&amp;E and the two-week maximum wait for suspected cancer patients to see a consultant. Andrew Lansley needs to explain exactly how patients would continue to benefit from such short waiting times if he plans to scrap these targets.\"</p>",
  "<p>State schools are increasingly \"embarrassed\" to talk about God, leaving a moral vacuum which has been filled by celebrity culture and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/thexfactor\">the X Factor</a>, a leading independent school head said yesterday.</p> <p>Tim Hastie-Smith, chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) which represents 250 private schools, said: \"The retreat of God from education has left a moral and spiritual vacuum and the breakdown of any shared value system. In our schools we have the freedom, if we choose, to fight that malaise. Not by retreating from society but engaging with the big questions in a mature and reasoned way, offering possible answers and challenges rather than the passing fads of an X-Factor culture.\"</p> <p>Separately, he told journalists that faith gives schools \"structure\", adding: \"In large parts of the education system God has become an embarrassment.\"</p> <p>Hastie-Smith, headmaster of Dean Close School, Cheltenham, also said schools were being smothered by red tape and government dictates and should be given the freedom to set their own curriculum and appoint staff that private schools and academies enjoy.</p> <p>Addressing the HMC's annual conference in London, he said: \"The independent sector has held firm over the years to the belief that education, if it is to achieve true excellence and if it is to be tailored to the needs of the individual child, should be free of government control.\"</p> <p>He claimed that the argument for independence had been won with the government's and opposition parties' support for academies. He went on: \"Now that we have won that argument the challenge is to press government to give real and lasting independence to the state sector, to support and encourage where we can the spread of independence, and to continue to demonstrate the enduring importance of independent education, which is one of this country's most valuable resources.</p> <p>\"Free from political control, free from the red tape and dictates which can smother our colleagues in most of the maintained sector; and with that freedom and independence comes a responsibility that we must inevitably take on, because others won't.\"</p> <p>This month Hastie-Smith announced plans to leave his present post to become principal of a new academy in Kettering.</p> <p>Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said Hastie-Smith should engage \"critically with aspects of the flawed government agenda, including academies\".</p> <p>The HMC has commissioned research from Buckingham University academic Alan Smithers, due to be published tomorrow, which will set out the contribution private schools make to the economy and education system. It will argue that the independent sector is responsible for keeping the UK near the top of the international educational league tables.</p>",
  "<p>The contagion from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street</a> crisis spread throughout Europe yesterday with the governments of Iceland and Germany stepping in to rescue ailing banks, following the decision in Britain to nationalise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> and the bail-out of the Belgian bank Fortis late on Sunday.</p> <p>In the United States, at the eye of the financial storm, Citigroup agreed to buy Wachovia, the fourth largest American bank, in another deal brokered by officials in Washington. It joined the growing roll call of seemingly invulnerable banks that have either failed or been taken over as the credit crunch has intensified.</p> <p>The widening turmoil was also on the agenda in France. President Nicolas Sarkozy summoned the heads of the nation's leading banks and insurance groups to an emergency summit this morning aimed at preventing the crisis from gaining traction there, even as rumours began to circulate that Franco-Belgian bank Dexia might be the next to face trouble.</p> <p>Economists were wary of predicting where the crunch might bite next. \"In the near term, it will be the weak ones that will be picked off,\" said Global Insight's chief European economist, Howard Archer. \"But obviously the more the turmoil and dislocation continues, the further this could spread. We live in vicious times.\"</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>The German government and other banks extended a \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) lifeline to Hypo Real Estate, the second largest commercial property lender in the country and one of the country's largest publicly quoted companies. The agreement represented the most serious impact of the crisis. </p> <p>The finance ministry said the government would provide \u20ac26.6bn, with several unidentified banks making up the rest. The deal had been hammered out with the German central bank, the Bundesbank, and financial regulators. In a statement, they said the financing would secure the future of the firm. </p> <p>A spokesman for the finance ministry said the decision to provide the credit came after \"very, very intensive consultations over the weekend\".</p> <p>HRE had written down substantial sums related to sub-prime mortgages at the beginning of the year, but otherwise had given little sign that it was facing difficulty in raising cash. There had been speculation in the German press over the weekend that the company could collapse. </p> <h2>Belgium</h2> <p>The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg reached agreement on an \u20ac11.2bn bail-out of Fortis on Sunday, in the hope of avoiding the scenes Britain witnessed as customers lined up to withdraw savings from Northern Rock. </p> <p>Fortis is one of the largest retail banks across the three countries. Each government took a 49% stake in the Fortis subsidiaries in its country. As a part of the agreement, they demanded Fortis sell the stake in Dutch bank ABN Amro which it bought a year ago for \u20ac24bn, a deal that marked the beginning of the bank's troubles. Filip Dierckx, who has been running Fortis for barely three days, yesterday admitted that it had overreached itself with \"decisions which were not the best\". </p> <p>Shares in Fortis continued to fall yesterday, down another 23%, despite the bail-out and underlining the fear in the markets. Like many other banks, Fortis has had to take large write-downs on the value of mortgage-backed securities.</p> <h2>Iceland</h2> <p>The government in Reykjavik seized control of Glitnir, one of Iceland's biggest banks, stoking fears that the tiny nation might be facing financial disaster.</p> <p>The Icelandic government bought a 75% stake in Glitnir for \u20ac600m. David Oddsson, governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, said he had been presented with a stark choice. \"Without this intervention Glitnir would have ceased to exist within the next few weeks. It's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>Iceland's economy expanded rapidly in recent years, making Icelanders among the richest people in Europe, but critics argue that the wealth has been built on too much debt. The country has been likened to a \"toxic hedge fund\". The Icelandic kr\u00f3na has lost 60% of its value against the dollar this year and hit new lows yesterday, making the situation only more difficult for the banks.</p> <p>After emergency discussions with the Central Bank of Iceland, an offer was made late on Sunday and the bank's board agreed to the deal yesterday morning. </p> <p>In a statement, Glitnir said its funding position had deteriorated in a matter of days. Its largest shareholder, the investment firm Stodir, also filed for bankruptcy yesterday.</p> <p>The rescue at least partly answers one question that has been hovering over Iceland; whether the banks had grown too large for the government to bail out if things went wrong. </p> <h2>United States</h2> <p>Two weeks ago Wachovia had been cast as a potential saviour of Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank, but in a sign of how quickly matters are shifting, the bank was yesterday sold to Citigroup at a knockdown price.</p> <p>In this instance, US taxpayers are not footing any immediate bills but could end up paying a share of any losses from Wachovia's ailing mortgage portfolio. Citigroup is paying $2.2bn in shares for the company and absorbing about $52bn in debt. Citigroup has not emerged unscathed. It has already taken more than $40bn in write-downs and other losses from mortgage-related investments but has the buffer of deposits from a large retail operation.</p> <p>Investors were spooked again and shares in other smaller banks in the US plummeted as they speculated on which might be the next to falter.</p>",
  "<p>Anthony Cugliari shouts to Aradhna Jaswar above the raging dance beat at Birmingham University's freshers' fair. \"Hey, we're <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/facebook\">Facebook</a> friends. It's Aradhna, right?\" \"Yeah. Hi,\" she says, eagerly extending the hand that's not clutching her new posters and freebies.</p> <p>Cugliari, 33, from Canada, and Jaswar, 18, from Wolverhampton, arrived in Birmingham less than a week ago. But they've been Facebook friends for three months - first spotting each other on the social networking site's group for Birmingham University law freshers.</p> <p>Both joined Facebook specifically to help themselves settle into university life. Cugliari had made 189 Facebook friends at Birmingham before he'd arrived. \"I'm already going to the pub with 10 friends as a result,\" he says. Jaswar says it has calmed her nerves to have had a bit of banter with students on her course before lectures start.</p> <p>Charlotte Wright, 20 and about to start a maths degree at the University of Leicester, has joined two Facebook groups, one for her course and another for her hall of residence. </p> <p>\"I'm not so worried about being completely alone in a new city any more,\" she says. \"It's been really reassuring to find out that everyone else is also suffering from that awkward mixture of nerves and excitement. Befriending people who've already done the first year of my course has yielded lots of useful advice.\"</p> <p><strong>Proper friends</strong></p> <p>Cugliari, Jaswar and Wright say they'll make up their minds about whether to become proper friends with their cyber mates when they meet them in person. But even if they decide to ignore every Facebook friend they've made, joining the site would still have proved valuable to their lives as freshers. </p> <p>How else would they have found out about the Oscar Wilde appreciation group at Leicester University, confirmed their attendance at the Birmingham freshers' masquerade ball, or found out if anyone else they knew would be at the Cops n' Robbers night?</p> <p>Some 95% of British undergraduates regularly use social networking sites, a study by Ipsos Mori found last year. Now staff at the University of Leicester are studying how Facebook can ease the loneliness most freshers feel. </p> <p>They quizzed 221 first-year undergraduates at Leicester on their views about Facebook between April and June this year. Some 72% said the site had played an important or very important part in helping them to adapt to university life. </p> <p>Over half - 55% - agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \"Facebook has helped me settle into university.\" The same percentage had used the site to make friends at university before lectures started. </p> <p>One student had made 260 friends before arriving, but the majority had made between one and five. By June of their first year, most of those polled had between 30 and 100 friends from Leicester University on Facebook. Some 37% used the site daily to arrange their university social lives, while 43% used it weekly.</p> <p>Facebook was still just one way they made university friends, though, the study discovered. While 19% agreed or strongly agreed that without Facebook they would be lonely, 35% disagreed and 29% strongly disagreed with this.</p> <p>All the same, how should universities use Facebook to help freshers, the Leicester staff asked the students. Tell us about timetable changes to our lectures and social events, they responded.</p> <p>Dr Richard Mobbs, the warden of Beaumont and Digby hall of residence at the University of Leicester, already does this. Four-fifths of his hall are on Facebook and before freshers arrive he sets up a group on the website for them. He then emails freshers inviting them to join it. Once they do, he contacts them on Facebook. </p> <p>He's linked Blackboard, the university's portal for staff and students to communicate online, to Facebook so that when the students log on to the social networking site they can see that their essay is due on Friday and that tomorrow's first year astrophysics is now in lecture theatre 2.23. The University of Lincoln is also experimenting with Facebook. Professor Mike Neary, Lincoln's dean of teaching and learning, says so far it has proved helpful in the retention of students because it keeps up their interest in the university.</p> <p><strong>Tutors not welcome</strong></p> <p>There is, however, a Facebook etiquette to observe, says Mobbs. While he will use Facebook to tell students at his hall about the five-a-side football competition, he says, \"if yellow block has made a mess in the corridor, I'd tell them so through other means\".</p> <p>Students are clear about what they'd like to say to lecturers who are thinking of contacting them on Facebook to discuss academic work: lay off.</p> <p>Some 41% of the freshers in Leicester's study were against tutors contacting them on the site. Michael Cox, 20 and at Bristol University, says: \"It rather smacks of them looking to be 'down with the kids' rather than helping educationally.\" </p> <p>\"Facebook and education should be kept strictly separate,\" says one student who took part in the Leicester study. \"Facebook is ... the ultimate tool of procrastination ... asking people to go on it for educational purposes is essentially giving them a green light to not do work.\"</p> <p>Mobbs says Facebook messages to students in his hall mainly come from other students and that he uses a \"lighter tone\" when he writes to them. But he thinks it no bad thing if the odd Facebook message comes from their hall warden. It reminds them that Facebook is not a closed site.</p> <p>\"We want to let them know that if they have a picture of themselves with their knickers on their head, it might not be such a good idea,\" he says. \"Their future employers will be able to see this. Not only that, but if people can see their date of birth and their mother's maiden name, they might be able to tap into their bank accounts.\"</p> <p>There are other downsides. Someone who might seem like your future best friend on Facebook might turn out to be the biggest bore when you meet them in the union bar.</p> <p>Anna, 18, an architecture fresher at Bath, hasn't used Facebook for university. \"People can be very judgmental and gain false impressions from profiles and photos. I didn't want my future acquaintances to have preconceptions of me before I'd even met them,\" she says.</p> <p>Meeting people online can take the excitement out of meeting them properly, says Michael. And then there's the minor issue of finding the time to read those chapters before your first seminar.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever feminists say - and he calls himself a feminist - men are doing more housework than they used to, according to Jonathan Gershuny, head of the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University. So when was the last time he carried out a domestic chore? \"I cleaned the cooker yesterday,\" he says. \"I actually enjoyed it because it's not a normal thing. And it happens that I have this extremely beautiful ceramic surface. And it's a distraction from this incredibly irritating stuff ...\" He gestures towards the computer, books and charts scattered around his desk. \"What's more, it's a displacement activity with immediate returns. Because I write this stuff and it's probably wrong, and no one's going to see it for 18 months, and even then they'll disagree with it, whereas I polish this beautiful bit of ceramic and OK, I don't get much from it, but at least I can see my face in it when I've polished it.\"</p> <p><strong>Far-reaching </strong></p> <p>Clearly, collecting and analysing information about how people spend the minutes of their day-to-day lives - as Gershuny has been doing for more than 30 years of his - and how they feel about the way they spend their time, is more complicated than it looks. And the implications of this painstaking and detailed work are also far-reaching, tapping not only into questions of work/life balance and male/female relations but also the economy, the environment, future lifestyles and personal fulfilment. \"It is the things that you do during the day that determine the sort of life you have,\" says Gershuny.</p> <p>Much of Gershuny's life over the next five years will be determined by his recent receipt of a \u00a31.9m grant from the Economic and Social Research Council. This will allow Gershuny, who becomes head of the sociology department at Oxford next month, and his colleagues at the Centre for Time Use Research to analyse not only the time spent on particular activities but also on how one activity follows on from another and how the activities of different family members interact. In the process, he hopes to get closer to an understanding of how the way people spend their time changes over time and between countries.</p> <p>The bases of this work, and of all his work over the past three decades, are time-use diaries. These are specially structured diaries in which people note down exactly what they have been doing, who they have been doing it with, and, in their own words, what they felt about it. Mostly, the diaries he uses have been collected by other people - generally national offices of statistics or other academics. The first diaries he used were viewer and listener availability surveys from the BBC dating back to the late 1930s. But he has also collected diary information himself, including carrying out a study in 2000 for Eurostat, the statistical body of the European Union. </p> <p>There are inevitably problems with this kind of data. Gershuny tells the story of an early time-use survey carried out in the 1950s among students in Boston. In the section of the diary labelled \"kissing and cuddling\" male respondents reported spending around half an hour a day on the activity compared to around three minutes for women. And there are other complications, which Gershuny hopes the more detailed ESRC-funded analysis will help to reduce. Take childcare, for example. A woman may report spending only one hour a day on childcare. But dig a bit further and you are likely to find that while she is washing up, watching TV or doing the vacuuming, the child is also there, so in fact the time she actually spends on childcare is closer to 10 hours.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Gershuny has managed to gather 60 reliable surveys carried out in 30 countries, dating back over 40 years. And through analysis of these he has been able to identify dramatic shifts in the ways people have been spending their time.</p> <p>One of these is that between the 1960s and late 1980s the number of hours people spent doing paid work fell steeply, although that trend is now reversing in the UK. At the same time, the amount of time spent in unpaid work rose. This is because rather than take a train, for example, driven by a driver paid for his work, we now drive ourselves. </p> <p>While, according to the diaries, people enjoy the way they spend their time slightly more than they used to, most of this appears to be because of the decline in manual paid work. \"Arguably ... such real improvement as we have experienced is this net change in enjoyment of the paid work we do,\" says Gershuny, \"rather than the fact that we are doing less of it.\"</p> <p>Then there is the housework issue. In all the countries surveyed, including the whole of Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the diaries show that women are doing about an hour less housework than they did 40 years ago. At the same time, men have more than doubled what they once did, although since this was only about 15 minutes a day in the first place, domestic gods remain rare. </p> <p>Gershuny maintains that the division of labour remains unfair not because of the work itself, but because of its relationship to longer-term power structures within a society. \"Where your day-to-day responsibilities mean that your main asset is devoted outside the labour force, you don't have as much human capital as your competitors,\" he says. The way each gender spends their time is therefore not the main issue. \"Time is the tool,\" he says. \"Just as economics is not about money. It's about who gets it and who does what with it. Who gets the benefit from it.\"</p> <p>This link between minute detail and sweeping social issues has been a feature of Gershuny's career. Via degrees in politics at Loughborough and research methods at Strathclyde, he joined the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex - now Science and Technology Policy Research - in the 1970s as a transport researcher, looking at the social effects of technological change, and became involved in imagining what lifestyles would be like in the year 2020. </p> <p>There followed a period at the University of Bath, which ended after he showed his wife a graphic he had compiled of male/female career paths. It showed the husband's career shooting up and the wife's shooting down. His wife, a full-time railway engineer, swiftly suggested a return to town. The work he does on share of domestic time makes him \"conscious of the need to behave properly\", he says.</p> <p>He is particularly interested how technology affects how we use our time. The data he collects, he thinks, will aid understanding of what our future wants will be and how they can be satisfied responsibly. \"Acting responsibly as a consumer takes more time,\" he says. \"But one way of having a lower environmental impact is to do less.\"</p> <p>His data also challenges assumptions such as that supermarkets save us time. Or that if it weren't for computers we would all be busy reading. Or that men are still shirking domestic duties as much as ever. \"Unless you have got the evidence and ... have been putting it together over a long period, you can't actually establish that the difference [in domestic work] is now much less,\" he says. An incontrovertible - if time-consuming - way to solve an argument over the washing-up.</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>59</p> <p><strong>Job </strong>Director of the Centre for Time Use Research, University of Oxford </p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Changing Times: Work and Leisure in Post-industrial Societies, Oxford University Press, 2000</p> <p><strong>Likes</strong> skiing, opera, malt whisky, cigars</p> <p><strong>Dislikes</strong> bortsch</p> <p><strong>Married</strong> to a railway software engineer, two sons</p>",
  "<h2>Teach Yourself evening classes</h2> <p>Nearly 30 years later, it is still hard to fathom why Declan chose beginner's German. After poring over a list of evening classes, my fellow cub reporter on the local newspaper decided that this was the one where he was most likely to find a girlfriend. </p> <p>Though lesson one probably did not get as far as schadenfreude, he could not have failed to recognise it in the general newsroom glee the next day, following his disgusted announcement that he had paid his fees for what turned out to be an all-male class. I almost didn't have the heart to tell him that Understand Your Car, which the recent acquisition of a fly-blown Hillman Hunter had prompted me to join, had turned out to be 80% female. </p> <p>Why this was so, who knows? But it exemplified the unpredictable and serendipitous nature of adult education. Perhaps it drove a disillusioned Declan towards Teach Yourself books.</p> <p>For 70 years, those distinctive dinky black and yellow covered titles have commanded retail shelf-space. Since 1938, an estimated 50 million readers have sought to broaden their skills and experience from 500 titles covering everything from Arabic to Zulu. </p> <p>They have always offered a clear alternative to classes. There are obvious time and economic advantages. A book can be read whenever you like and at your pace. If you are nervous about performing in class, or just not very sociable, a book has the edge.</p> <p>Having competed with evening classes, Teach Yourself, which describes itself as \"the original self-improvement publisher\", has decided to up the ante. With the loss of a million and a half publicly funded adult education places in the past three years, it has spotted a new market.</p> <p>Its new product is called \"your evening class\" - yes, lower case is correct - and is billed as \"flexible, tutor-led learning\". It comes in a chunky box containing \"30 structured lessons - the equivalent to a year's worth of classes\" - spoken by \"a real tutor\" on audio CDs or DVD-Roms. There are workbooks, and a reference book. And there is an \"online community\" to commune with others doing your course. These are early days, so, for example, there are only three messages on the forum for those doing Spanish when I check. </p> <p>You could do a lesson a week, as if going to classes, or you could gallop through. So far there are five \"your evening classes\" - Spanish, French, starting a small business, complementary therapies and improve your maths. Counselling, basic computing and creative writing are coming in December. No doubt one day there will be German, too. Still interested, Declan?<br><strong>Peter Kingston</strong></p> <h2>HE budgets lagging behind energy costs?</h2> <p>Bosses at the university of St Andrews, in the lowland county of Fife, must be used to setting aside a hefty sum to foot their utility bills. But not even the unseasonably chilly summer can justify the 54% jump in energy costs seen by the university since July 2007. On the cusp of a 5% pay rise for lecturers and a potentially expensive pension reform, St Andrews is feeling the financial chill. It's not the only UK university to be hit hard by the surging price of energy.</p> <p>According to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), higher education institutions across the UK are looking at \"a fairly dramatic increase\" on the \u00a3285m spent on gas and electricity in 2006. </p> <p>Durham University predicts that its utility costs will rise by 20% come next April, while in middle England the University of Warwick expects to spend some \u00a31.5m more on energy bills by the end of this year. This sum will effectively swallow up hard-earned energy efficiency savings made by the university over the past seven years.</p> <p>These heavily inflated bills are thanks to the rapid rise in wholesale gas and electricity prices, which are up 65% and 45% respectively this year, according to ScottishPower, one of the big six UK energy suppliers.</p> <p>Universities are starting to bring in a range of energy efficiency measures to help tackle these spiralling energy bills. Durham recently created a new post to help cut energy costs and promote sustainability within the university's 16 colleges and numerous city buildings. As dean of environmental sustainability, Professor Tim Burt has the job of addressing the \"major impact\" a \u00a31m rise in energy costs has had on the university's budget.</p> <p>With a stock of medieval buildings, the University of St Andrews is going back-to-basics with its approach to economising on energy. \"We have an estate of very old buildings,\" says energy officer David Sturtchfield, \"so getting the basics such as pipe and loft insulation right can help cut energy costs significantly.\"</p> <p>Universities including Leeds and Exeter are investing in all-new buildings to ensure that they meet national sustainability standards. Nearly half of UK universities have also signed up to the Carbon Trust's higher education Carbon Management Programme to help cut costs while reducing their emissions.</p> <p>Richard Rugg, the Trust's head of public sector, claims that the scheme can make energy \"a controllable overhead for organisations and lead to significant cash savings.\" According to the Carbon Trust, an average university following its guidelines will save 20% in annual energy bills, amassing savings of more than \u00a318m this year.</p> <p>But this saving barely keeps pace with the rapid inflation in fuel costs, which - stacked on top of pension and salary rises - could topple many universities' carefully balanced budgets.<br><strong>Frances Hall</strong></p> <h2>What we've learned this week</h2> <p>Somewhere between Rotherham and Birmingham is a missing computer disc listing almost 11,500 teachers' names, addresses and registration numbers.</p> <p>Teachers aren't to worry, though, said an apologetic General Teaching Council, which sent the disc via couriers. It contains no financial information, National Insurance numbers or dates of birth. </p> <p>For the hard-line teachers' union the NASUWT, the GTC's apology \"didn't go far enough\". The union called for compensation to be offered to any teacher who could prove their details had been fraudulently used.</p> <p>It was hardly the invitation to join the profession schools need. Vacancies for teachers in primary and nursery schools in England have risen by nearly a third in the past year. And empty posts in secondary schools are up by more than a fifth, with the biggest shortages in maths and science, government statistics show.</p> <p>An extra 870 nursery and primary teachers are needed, while local authority-run secondary schools require another 250 maths teachers, 270 science and 210 English teachers.</p> <p>The national teacher recruitment agency, the Training and Development Agency for Schools, thinks it knows just where to find potential applicants - the City. The TDA has been pitching up in Canary Wharf and the Square Mile this week to woo the banker boys and girls from the trading floor to the classroom.</p> <p>Just don't tell any eager career converts what Ed Balls has up his sleeve: an independent forum where parents can voice their complaints about their child's school. Those in charge of the forum will have the power to deal with gripes that have not been resolved by schools and to take action if they feel a parent has been treated unfairly. \"We will now consult on strengthening the complaints procedures for parents,\" said Balls.</p> <p>And as the credit crunches, some parents must have been delighted to hear that ministers are considering giving free school meals to all children.</p> <p>A test-run of the idea will go ahead in two parts of the country - as yet unchosen - and in a third area, means-testing will be changed so more pupils qualify for free meals.</p> <p>Estimates suggest that, if expanded to every local authority, the meals scheme could cost up to \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>Still, if it improves health, standards and behaviour, as an experiment in Hull seems to show, those teaching vacancies might be easier to fill.<br><strong>Jessica Shepherd</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 2 2008.

  "<p>Theatre, if it is to survive, needs to be abundantly theatrical. Which is a polite way of saying I see little future for this kind of workmanlike reduction of an existing novel. Tracy Chevalier's book is an immensely subtle, compelling, first-person narrative about the obsessiveness of genius and a girl's disruptive impact on Vermeer's household: in David Joss Buckley's adaptation it becomes a conventional, thwarted love-story.</p> <p>The incidents are still there. Griet, daughter of a Delft tile-painter, goes to work as a maid for the Vermeer family. Her instinctive visual sense sparks the master's interest just as much as her looks arouse his pot-bellied patron, Van Ruijven. But it is Griet's privileged access to Vermeer's studio that provokes the jealousy of his wife. And when Griet secretly becomes the model for one of his most beautiful paintings, she finds herself in danger of sacrificing her future happiness to his quest for perfection.</p> <p>Like a Dutch interior, Chevalier's book is full of delicate shades and half-tones. It plays with a host of ideas - the egotism of genius, the corruption of innocence. But what is implicit becomes hopelessly explicit in Buckley's version, as characters explain their urges. </p> <p>When a quivering Vermeer cries \"I had to paint her\" it sounds like a euphemism for something more basic. When his spouse cries \"he spends more time with her than with me\", she seems no different from an executive's wife bemoaning her husband's devotion to his secretary. Only in the tense relationship between patron and artist is the novel extended, partly because Niall Buggy as Van Ruijven, the performance of the evening, offsets the groping old moneybags' economic power with the melancholy aura of ageing lust.</p> <p>Adrian Dunbar is perfectly decent as Vermeer, Kimberley Nixon endows Griet with hungry curiosity, and Sara Kestelman is starched wisdom as the mother-in-law. Peter Mumford's sets and lighting please the eye, and Joe Dowling shows his directorial skill in giving the fragmented scenes an architectural shape. </p> <p>Yet again, adaptation proves Jonathan Miller's point about giving fictional characters an \"impertinent visibility\". In the novel Vermeer, viewed exclusively through Griet's eyes, acquires a mesmeric power. Once, however, you see him guiltily snuggling up while she grinds pigments, he is danger of simply turning into a revised version of that old cliche: the artist in love with his model.</p>",

  "<p>Do colleges want to follow McDonald's? You betcha, judging from the number of college representatives who turned up for an event to show them how. They were in the majority at a conference offering advice to colleges, training firms and employers in general on how to construct their own qualifications.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the burger giant created a stir by becoming one of the first organisations other than examination bodies to be allowed to launch its own qualifications, which were, inevitably, dubbed the McA-levels.</p> <p>Some 80 college principals and senior managers attended the event organised by the awarding body NCFE, at the National Liberal Club in Whitehall, London. </p> <p>Further education is clearly eager to take advantage of legislation that came into force last year. The Further Education and Training Act 2007 extends qualification awarding powers to all types of further education institutions.</p> <p>So far, only one college, City College Norwich, has taken up the offer, compared with four employers. CCN has successfully applied to validate and accredit its own foundation degrees, the first of which is about to be launched for students seeking careers in financial services.</p> <p>NCFE sensed there is growing interest among other organisations to follow suit and set up the conference to explain the implications. It is offering to act as a consultant to colleges seeking awarding-body status, or to be their partner in the process.</p> <p>But why would colleges want to set their own qualifications, when they already have strong partnerships with universities for validating their foundation and honours degrees and with the plethora of awarding bodies that set vocational and occupational qualifications?</p> <p>There could be a financial reason. \"We are paying hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in awarding-body fees,\" John Widdowson, principal of New College Durham, explains. \"The cost of assessment totals more than \u00a3500,000 and we are seeking to reduce that bill.\" His college plans to follow CCN and is among the first to be applying for foundation degree awarding status - but he stresses that cost reduction is not the \"key driver\" to his college's ambition.</p> <p>The main motivation, he insists, is having the flexibility to customise qualifications to meet employers' requirements. \"Some specialist markets can be too small for a traditional awarding body,\" he adds. \"There are also a lot of subject areas where colleges have expertise and universities don't. We can work with employers and customise and respond to their needs more quickly. It can take time to go through the university validation systems.\"</p> <p>One subject area his college offers is salon and spa management. \"I cannot think of any university that would provide qualifications for that,\" he says. Another is in training foot care assistants.</p> <p>\"We have a school of podiatry and run courses for podiatrists and chiropodists. We plan to run courses for foot care assistants and ancillary workers, but there is no qualification at that level. There is a need for another level of qualification below degree level. We would like to offer it.\"</p> <p>He attended the conference to explore the ramifications. \"There are strong arguments for working with existing awarding bodies that already have the infrastructure and the experience,\" he says. \"I am going to go away and think about it.\"</p> <p><strong>Benefits questionable</strong></p> <p>Yet the cost benefits of becoming an awarding body may be questionable. Graham Drummond, clerk to the corporation at City and Islington College, doubts that significant savings can be made. \"If you want to award foundation degrees you have to provide \u00a350,000 up front to the Quality Assurance Agency as a sunk [non-recoverable] cost from day one,\" he says. </p> <p>\"There are also the internal costs of setting up validation panels, and the qualifications have to be assured and reviewed. There are reporting requirements to the QAA, and then you have to award it. All this means employing more staff and you could simply be internalising your costs.</p> <p>\"I believe you would need to have more than 2,000 learners on foundation degree courses to make it worthwhile. We have only around 450 and I don't think that is a runner for us.</p> <p>\"The QCA route, offering vocational qualifications, is a bit more attractive, but the risk is that the students coming through our door want to get something that is externally accredited, like a City and Guilds or a BTec.\"</p> <p>He does, however, believe that awarding qualifications is an essential part of the self-regulation process for colleges, and suggests that consortiums of colleges awarding qualifications could be the answer.</p> <p>And another advantage could be the improvement to a college's reputation. \"The spin off that Norwich have got in terms of their reputation has been astounding,\" he says.</p> <p>That was certainly one appeal for Pat Bacon, principal of St Helens College in Merseyside. \"It strengthens the brand if your name is on the certificate,\" she says. \"We already write qualifications or parts of qualifications. We have written programmes for employers and units within existing qualifications. Traditionally, we have done that in partnership with an awarding body.</p> <p>\"What is different about this is that we could accredit ourselves. Whether we need to do that I am not sure, but I am interested in learning more about this process.\"</p> <p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p> <p>She also highlights the flexibility advantages of awarding qualifications. \"It is the flexibility to tailor-make qualifications,\" she adds. \"It can be a long, tedious process to get a qualification revised or to bring a new one in. We want to be able to respond speedily.\"</p> <p>The reputation of Barnfield College in Luton has already been enhanced by the success of two academies it has sponsored, which opened last year for 11- to 16-year-olds in Luton. Schools minister Lord Adonis singled out Barnfield South and Barnfield West academies as among the best performers.</p> <p>Barnfield has already taken the first steps to awarding its own foundation degrees, but will that further enhance its reputation? Lynn Thackway, its vice-principal, thinks so: \"We already have a strong brand that is synonymous with excellence and outstanding provision. This could promote our brand even more. If you are an outstanding college with a good reputation, students will be proud to hang your certificates on their walls.</p> <p>\"We know that further education colleges are seen as lesser entities by universities. This could put us on an equal footing. There are lots of outstanding colleges delivering outstanding HE provision, and awarding our own qualifications could help us to be recognised for that.\"</p>",
  "<p>The planners and politicians have got it wrong. Passengers from the provinces have to use domestic flights to connect with international services because there is no simple or affordable way of reaching Heathrow airport by public transport (Tories plan \u00a320bn 180mph rail link instead of Heathrow third runway, September 29). Rail tickets are either extortionate or highly restrictive, and luggage space is often minimal. And journeys from most destinations involve multiple changes, often on to crowded tubes or traffic-prone coach services. This is impractical for those with heavy luggage or children in tow. </p> <p>Heathrow planners should follow the lead of Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris and provide direct, reasonably priced rail services from the airport to every major city in Britain. All that is needed is a direct rail link to Reading, and on to the north and west. Heathrow-Reading is the most important missing link in Britain's railway network and would be far better value than grandiose schemes to duplicate existing high-speed lines.<br><strong>Peter Zemroch</strong><br>Ellesmere Port, Merseyside </p> <p>Travelling to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds is already faster by train than by plane, if travel to and from airports and check-in times are taken into account. What we need is a slash in rail ticket prices, not in journey times.<br><strong>Kasper Lurcock</strong><br>Bristol </p> <p>New high-speed rail links are a very good idea but should extend to Scotland. A similar rail link from the east coast ports to the rail-freight terminal at Corby, using the same sort of trains that run through the Channel tunnel, would cut carbon emissions from the lorries that use the congested A14. With time, this route could be extended to the Avon docks and elsewhere. <br><strong>Ernie Goody</strong><br>Haverhill, Suffolk </p> <p>Mike Heylings (Letters, September 29) suggests the French government should buy our railways as well as our nuclear power stations. His wish has already been granted in part. About a third of our passenger train operating companies and the largest freight train operating company are now wholly or partly owned by the governments of Germany, France and Netherlands. The Green party policy is to take the railways back into ownership by the UK public. Labour party policy appears to be to hand over our railways, along with our energy utilities, to foreign governments. I don't recall seeing that in its manifesto.<br><strong>lan Francis</strong><br>National transport speaker, Green party </p> <p>So the Tories plan a rail link instead of a third Heathrow runway, creating the staggering prospect I might actually vote Tory next time.

  "<p>It was a bad plan - but it was a plan. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/30/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">The refusal of Congress to back Hank Paulson's bail-out</a> takes us into new territory. George Bush told Americans to expect \"a serious financial crisis\" and \"a long and painful recession\" if the legislation was blocked. Paulson went down on his knees to beg for support. But opposition from ordinary Americans killed the bill.</p> <p>It was a historic day: even the decimal point on the Dow Jones average made it memorable. The final reading was: down 777.7 points. Some horsetrading in Washington may yet produce a revised deal that would be acceptable to the politicians, but the banks know there will be no easy handouts: Main Street, for better or worse, wants to see Wall Street suffer. In an election year, voters get what they want.</p> <p>What happens next? The immediate challenge for the central banks is simply to keep the banking system functioning - ensuring that payments are processed and that companies can continue to pay everyday bills, such as wages. The Federal Reserve will flood the market with emergency funds. The sums were already staggering. Before the vote in Congress yesterday the Fed released $620bn. The number may get bigger in the next few days. It's a case of using \"all tools available\", as the Treasury put it. These could also include emergency cuts in interest rates, as we saw after 9/11.</p> <p>Even so, more bank collapses and takeovers look almost inevitable. Money is flowing towards perceived safe havens at alarming speed. Ever since Paulson announced his plan 10 days ago, two of the biggest US commercial banks have been taken over and their shareholders wiped out; Bradford &amp; Bingley has been nationalised; Fortis, Belgium's biggest bank, has been partly nationalised; and the crisis has spread into major institutions in Germany and Iceland. All that happened while the Paulson plan looked likely to be passed in some form.</p> <p>In Washington politicians, if they are serious about finding a new bail-out model, will have to recognise the reasons why the last one failed.</p> <p>Paulson and Bush misjudged the mood of the US. Paulson asked for authority to spend $700bn with no outside scrutiny, and offered Congress few details on how the cash would be spent. What prices would the treasury pay? Paulson couldn't say, and no amount of muttering about \"reverse auctions\" could shift the perception that the taxpayer would be fleeced. His original proposal ran to just three pages. Bush's address to the nation lasted only 12 minutes. The voters saw arrogance.</p> <p>What form would a revised bill take? There would clearly have to be greater scrutiny of the Treasury's operation and tougher curbs on executive pay. But the markets will be concerned that the size of the bail-out will also be reduced.</p> <p>Even before yesterday, $700bn had come to be seen in some quarters as too little. Worse, economists had started to question Paulson's approach to the problem. Many argued that buying distressed assets would not improve banks' basic problem that too little capital is supporting too much lending.</p> <p>So a revised plan might mean offering capital to banks. In practice, that might involve the US government taking stakes in financial institutions as a means of protecting taxpayers. Citigroup, in buying Wachovia yesterday, agreed to give $12bn of preference shares to the banking regulator as part of a loss-sharing arrangement.</p> <p>But the painful fact is that legislation can't be passed overnight, and that leaves financial markets time to panic.</p> <p>In the UK the biggest worry is Lloyds TSB's plan to buy HBOS. The share prices are not behaving as if the deal is going to happen.</p> <p>HBOS has traded as much as 20% below the \"see through\" price - the price you'd expect to see if HBOS's shares were to convert into Lloyds stock. The bottom line is that the deal can only happen with the support of a Lloyds shareholders' vote. We found yesterday that you can't always rely on the voters.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> faces three more races in Japan, China and Brazil to complete the job he failed to do by a single point last year, and McLaren have indicated that they are prepared to change their strategy in order to sew up the title.</p> <p>Previously the team's philosophy has been to win as many races as possible, hoping that the championship would follow. Now they have decided to take a more measured approach, as evidenced by Hamilton's tactical run to third place behind Fernando Alonso and Nico Rosberg in Sunday's Singapore grand prix. </p> <p>\"I think an inherent weakness in the team and Lewis last year was the overwhelming desire to win the race at almost any risk,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's chief operating officer.</p> <p>\"That is more forgivable in Lewis - you would like to have that in a young racing driver. We as a team should have been more disciplined than we were. Like here we didn't win but came away with more points than we thought, but if you scout around you will not see the euphoria that we ought to have, given the actual results. </p> <p>\"If I had believed on the way in here that we would go away with a seven-point lead in the drivers' championship and a one-point lead in the constructors', I would have snatched it with both hands.\"</p> <p>Last year Hamilton had looked poised to win the championship at his first attempt and his triumph in the Japanese grand prix was probably the most impressive drive of 2007. Then he slid off the track at walking pace coming into the pit lane in Shanghai and lost out by one point to Kimi Raikkonen in the final race in Brazil.</p> <p>\"We wanted to win and pushed too hard when we didn't need to. Championships aren't won like that,\" said Whitmarsh. \"Last year was an example of that. While it is excusable for Lewis in his first year, it was not excusable for us as a team.\"</p> <p>Now Hamilton has to ensure that he at least maintains the lead he established over Ferrari's Felipe Massa on Sunday to reach the tape first in what has become a two-horse race. The Brazilian's winning prospects here were destroyed by a botched stop on the 18th lap which left him trailing his refuelling hose when he tried to exit the pit too early.</p> <p>Ferrari said last night that they would review their electronic pit-stop light system. \"We were not using the electronic system, it was run manually,\" said the team director, Stefano Domenicali. \"When there are a lot of cars coming into the pit in a safety-car situation it is better to have [the system working manually]. You control the green light, and unfortunately there was a mistake. We will analyse what we did in the other pit stops.\" </p> <p>Domenicali said there was no question of the mechanic responsible for Sunday's incident being replaced for the remaining three races. \"We win together and we lose together. In that respect the philosophy will not change because of one unfortunate mistake.\" </p> <p>Massa said he had spoken to the mechanic and told him there were no hard feelings. \"I'm not the kind of guy who goes to the guy and fights with him. So I go to the guy and give him even more motivation because we need him and we need everybody together for the last three races.\"</p> <p>The Brazilian's consolation is that he has to battle only Hamilton and not his own team-mate Raikkonen for the title. \"The pressures of trying to win a world championship in a season when it's pretty obvious that the contest is going all the way to the wire can be really nerve-racking,\" said Niki Lauda, who knows about two-horse races - in 1976 he lost the title to James Hunt by a single point and eight years later he won it by the smallest-ever margin of half a point from his McLaren team-mate Alain Prost.</p> <p>\"It doesn't matter whether your key rival is a team-mate or not, you just have to concentrate and keep your focus. When I was racing Alain in '84 he arrived at the start of the season and tried to take over what many people saw as my team through the expedient of driving harder, faster and more effectively than me.</p> <p>\"In a situation like that it is very difficult to keep your mind on the job, but the way you have to approach it is to maximise your own potential while at the same time exploiting your rival's weak points. With Alain I could see that he was braver and more committed than I was prepared to be in qualifying, squeezing through gaps in traffic which I wasn't prepared to risk. So the only way I was going to beat him was through my experience. </p> <p>\"In the case of Lewis and Felipe they are both relatively new to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> so it will just come down to a test of nerve and consistency between the two of them.\"</p> <p>Jody Scheckter, who won the 1979 world championship in a straight fight with his Ferrari team-mate Gilles Villeneuve, stressed the importance of shrugging off the pressure. \"Gilles was braver than me and prepared to take more risks,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But he also made a few mistakes, dropping wheels over kerbs and so on. I knew I could bring more consistency to the job, but it was a question of not letting the pressure get to me. I was always confident I could do it, though.\"</p> <h2>Two-horse races that went to the wire</h2> <p><strong>Mike Hawthorn</strong> <strong>1958</strong></p> <p>The driver from Farnham became Britain's first world champion after driving his Ferrari to second place in Casablanca behind Stirling Moss, taking the title by a single point.</p> <p><strong>Graham Hill 1968</strong></p> <p>A three-way decider at Mexico City saw Graham Hill drive his Lotus to his second crown, edging out Denny Hulme and Jackie Stewart.</p> <p><strong>James Hunt 1976</strong> </p> <p>The British McLaren driver clinched the championship by one point from Niki Lauda in torrential rain in Japan. Lauda, who had recovered from burns sustained when he crashed his Ferrari in Germany, lost his nerve and withdrew after a couple of laps.</p> <p><strong>Michael Schumacher</strong> <strong>1994</strong></p> <p>The German won the first of his seven titles after a controversial collision with Damon Hill in Adelaide. Many allege that Schumacher deliberately drove Hill off the road, knowing that his own car had suffered terminal damage after glancing a trackside wall.</p>",
  "<p>The US government's $700bn emergency bail-out of the banking industry collapsed in disarray tonight as Congress voted against the plan, sending Wall Street stocks plummeting and spreading ripples of shock through the global financial markets. </p> <p>Despite a round-the-clock weekend negotiating session, members of the House of Representatives ignored a last-ditch appeal from George Bush by rejecting the rescue scheme on an initial count by 228 votes to 205.</p> <p>As Congressional leaders went back to the drawing board, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on fears of further banking failures.</p> <p>The blue-chip average closed down 7%, a 778 points drop which exceeds its biggest ever previous one-day points fall of 684 in September 2001.</p> <p>The dramatic and unexpected show of political opposition came largely from the Republican benches, where a majority of congressmen opposed the measure citing concern among the public about the cost of the bail-out. The White House said Bush was \"very disappointed\" by the outcome. </p> <p>The Republican leader in the House, John Boehner, pledged that political leaders would continue looking for a solution which could satisfy all sides. </p> <p>\"We put everything we had into getting the votes to get there today,\" he said. \"I think we need to renew our efforts to find a solution that Congress can support.\" </p> <p>On Wall Street, there were audible groans as traders gathered around television monitors to watch the vote playing out. </p> <p>\"Everybody just stood their with their mouths open,\" said Sal Catrini, an executive director at JP Morgan in New York, who predicted that uncertainty would send stocks falling even further. \"We're seeing real selling but no buyers.\" </p> <p>The price of oil plummeted by more than $6 per barrel on concern that commercial activity would wane, the dollar shrunk on worries about the future of the US economy and the price of gold leapt by 3% as investors sought safe havens from the storm. </p> <p>In London, where the market closed before the outcome of the vote became clear, the FTSE 100 index dropped by 5.3%, shedding 269 points to close at 4,818. </p> <p>But in New York, major indices were down even further. The technology-dominated Nasdaq exchange was heading for its biggest drop since September 2001 with a fall of 6.3%, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped by 6%. </p> <p>Lawmakers' negative vote came in spite of a spate of reminders of the fragility of the financial industry. Following the British government's nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley over the weekend, a US bank, Wachovia, was rescued from the brink of collapse by Citigroup today and the Icelandic government stepped in to rescue one of its leading banks. </p> <p>The Democratic leader in the House, Barney Frank, said he would assess the economic reaction before deciding what to do next. He blamed Republicans for \"killing\" the bail-out. But conservatives said the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, had caused ill-will by making a \"partisan\" speech in the closing hours of a debate on the plan. </p> <p>The bail-out was conceived as a government fund to buy up toxic mortgage-related securities which have poisoned the balance sheet of leading banks, causing the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and threatening other Wall Street institutions. </p> <p>Over the weekend, leaders from both parties packed the plan with concessions in an attempt to win over sceptics. The Democrats inserted limits to pay packets for senior banking executives while the Republicans won the creation of a state-sponsored insurance scheme intended to guarantee against future defaults. </p> <p>The Congressional vote amounts to a shattering defeat for Bush and for the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and will further undermine the White House's credibility in Bush's last months in office. </p> <p>In an early morning address, Bush had appealed for approval from Congress: \"With this strong and decisive legislation, we will help restart the flow of credit, so American families can meet their daily needs and American businesses can make purchases, ship goods, and meet their payrolls.\"</p>",

It looks to be a 3D third-person adventure, more in the vein of early PS1 incarnations than the graphically simplified (but <a href=\"http://uk.wireless.ign.com/articles/693/693886p1.html\">still pretty good</a>) Resident Evil: The Missions. The press release is <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1252190\">here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338101240\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/29/1222720528201/4_tif_jpgcopy.jpg\" alt=\"Silent Hill Mobile 2\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silent Hill hospital - not quite meeting government healthcare targets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Silent Hill Mobile 2 (Konami/Glu)</strong><br>Resident Evil doesn't hold the monopoly on miniaturised survival horror mayhem. Released last year the original Silent Hill Mobile effectively chopped up Konami's freaky series, plausibly re-imagining it as a Myst-style first-person puzzler. Number two retains the point-and-click interface and slow-burning narrative, but switches the psychological trauma from a ghostly orphanage to Silent Hill's decrepit hospital. MRSA is likely to be the least of your worries. </p> <p><strong>FIFA 09 (EA Mobile)</strong><br>EA's footie titles have been well-received on mobile, even if Gameloft's Real Football and Konami's PES titles have enjoyed the critical edge. In response, the 2009 edition seems to be abandoning the all-out casual feel, dropping the isometric viewpoint used in last year's iteration in favour of a console-style sideways display, as well as adding new timing meters for tackling and shooting. There's an enhanced Season mode, too, and a new Man of the Match feature, which rewards players who display a good work ethic. I also love the late-eighties arcade-style visuals \u2013 reminds me of Super Sidekicks.

  "<p>With the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30bailout.html?hp\">failure</a> today of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">$700bn economic bail-out package</a> before Congress, the Reagan Revolution died. Allowing this crisis to continue without any viable alternative represents the end of an era for the Republican party. With uncertainty growing in a market built on expectations, our economic woes will worsen. Ironically, as this crisis expands and continues to collapse major corporations, Americans will demand greater government intervention. A party whose platform opposes nearly any proposal that uses government as the medicine for a financial disease will not be able to survive this crisis.</p> <p>Politicians voted today by putting their fingers to the wind, and used ideology rather than expert advice to determine their position. John McCain, who recently gave himself credit for suspending his campaign and shoring up House Republican support for the bill, boarded his plane without comment upon hearing of the bill's failure. And while Main Street's short-term cynicism about Bush's proposal may have been satisfied, such reservations on the part of the public was the result of a poor marketing job by an unpopular president, and ultimately Americans will hold accountable politicians who are seen as failing to rescue them from this crisis.</p> <p>America is waking up to the fact that the brand of laissez-faire capitalism that has guided America since the Reagan Revolution is a farce. Everyone was saying it, but no businessperson really believed in it when it came to their own family. As Paul Krugman recently remarked: \"Just as there are no atheists in foxholes, there are no libertarians in a financial crisis.\" Few people are willing to allow 35% unemployment and economic disaster to stand firm on the very principles that likely triggered this mess. It is true that over the long run, even if we did nothing America's markets would recover, and we would once again enjoy prosperity. But as John Maynard Keynes pointed out during our last great financial disaster: <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/66/8/32508.html\">\"In the long run, we're all dead.\"</a> <br> If you listen to the politicians and pundits, we are not supposed to blame the economic philosophy that has deregulated the markets and made financial industry lobbyists the prime architects of the very legislation designed to oversee their businesses. Instead, Americans are supposed to view this financial collapse as a disaster which was the fault of greedy people and irresponsible consumers. They used bad judgment. But where is the sense in this analysis? We are blaming consumers for trying to get easy credit, and financial institutions for trying to make lots of money. Is that not how the system was supposed to work? How can we second-guess willing sellers and willing buyers who purchased mortgage-backed securities at their market rate? Their risk, their reward \u2013 but apparently not their loss. The invisible hand seems all too obviously elitist. The rich are in trouble, so we act. The poor have been in trouble since the beginning of time, but that's just background noise on our walk to work. For the first time since 9/11, I've seen a president who has finally set aside his ideology and tried to govern. George Bush understands, at long last, that he cannot be remembered as being the 21st century's Herbert Hoover. Perhaps it is the sense of his legacy dawning upon him in the twilight hours of his presidency, but no one of sound mind is willing to allow financial institutions of the magnitude of AIG to collapse and trigger a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/14/news/economy/greenspan/index.htm\">once-in-a-century </a> economic decline. <br> No one, apparently, but House Republicans, who killed a bill that Wall Street felt was necessary to cure this economic crisis, causing the market to plunge more than 400 points in 10 minutes. Fiscal conservatives tried and failed to make the central component of the bailout a combination of deregulation and tax cuts. While on paper giving financial institutions a temporary capital gains tax cut seems like a serious proposal, fiscal policy and regulatory changes are medium to long-term solutions that would do nothing to infuse cash into the system in the short term. This would have done very little to shore up confidence before the markets opened around the world this week, nor would it address the original sin of mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>To address this problem, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27plan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin\">House Republicans pushed for an insurance programme</a> that could be used by the Treasury secretary, even though he has reportedly shown no interest in using such a tool. Such a proposal can hardly be characterised as anything other than a face-saving measure that does little to dampen the impact of a $700bn bail-out deal. How can fiscal conservatives explain to their constituents that in time of serious economic crisis, their philosophy simply is not a practical short-term solution? It seems that while Republicans can spin \"victory\" in Iraq, they cannot spin \"profit\" on Wall Street.<br> While no one can yet suggest America is on the verge of a second New Deal, paradigm shifts are often not obviously apparent at the time they occur. The second phase of the government's response to this crisis will involve regulatory overhaul. Congress will have to hold hearings on the cause of this disaster and they will no doubt find many instances of deregulation as the culprit. In 1982, Ronald Reagan pushed for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garn_-_St_Germain_Depository_Institutions_Act\">Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act</a>, which in Title VIII specifically provided for the very adjustable-rate mortgages that have left consumers struggling to make their payments. They will find that in 1999 it was senator Phil Graham and a veto-proof Republican majority that demanded an overhaul of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which separated commercial and investment banking. This might have contained this problem to one sector of the lending industry. Investigators will find that in 2000, Republicans and free market ideologues passed the Commodities Futures Modernisation Act which reduced transparency in the derivatives market. As Congress fulfils its oversight role, a picture will emerge of a comprehensive deregulation strategy which led to this crisis. <br> The end of the Reagan Revolution would not mean a sharp turn toward socialism, but a maturation of economic policy that understands the complexity and power of large financial institutions. Corporate executives should not have the right to risk the entire American economy \u2013 indeed the global economy \u2013 as part of their portfolio management, regardless of Ayn Rand's philosophical musings. While Republicans struggle to explain how the irresponsible decisions of executives and consumers are to blame, but their own policies which afforded them this opportunity are not, one wonders about the legacy of Reagan's economic policies. It seems that in a time of serious economic crisis, Americans will turn to Roosevelt rather than Reagan. Doing nothing simply isn't an option, and tax cuts and deregulation in a time of corporate excess makes little sense. It is only natural to wonder if this is more than a temporary shift in political discourse.</p>",
  "<p>As a tense Washington worries about the future of the $700bn bailout plan, there is a real sigh of relief in news that Wachovia Bank, the nation's sixth largest and one that is chock full of lousy mortgages, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/09/29/fdic-citi-to-buy-wachovias-banking-operations/\">has been taken over</a> by Citigroup under government auspices. That means the depositors are safe and it avoids putting more pressure on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the New Deal government institution created to protect small depositors should their banks go down. </p> <p>The FDIC has been under considerable strain in recent months and there has been a worry about its ability to survive. Of course, a collapse of the FDIC would be an unprecedented disaster for the general public, which would suddenly find itself unable to withdraw money from the bank. Since Wachovia is being taken over by Citigroup, it does not qualify as a failure and won't need FDIC insurance. What's more, if the FDIC faced serious collapse, then doubtless Congress would step in to shore it up. So, in all likelihood, the public is safe. Still, economists and journalists outside the Wall Street sphere are musing on the future of this venerable institution.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/opinion/29kristol.html?hp\">New York Times </a>on Monday conservative Bill Kristol said, \"There are serious economists, for example, who think we could be on the verge of a huge bank run. Congress may have to act to authorize the FDIC to provide far greater deposit insurance, and the secretary of the Treasury to protect money market funds. McCain can call for Congress to stand ready to pass such legislation. He can say more generally that in the tough times ahead, we'll need a tough president willing to make tough decisions.''<br> Created by Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression to persuade people it was safe to use banks, the FDIC has only $45.2bn in funds - nowhere near enough to cover depositors if a few more big banks, or 20 to 30 medium sized banks, should collapse.  As of the end of June, the FDIC was closely monitoring 117 \"troubled\" banks, up from 90 in the first quarter of 2008. That number is expected to grow, though it is small when measured against the nation's total of 8,400 banks. Still, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;sid=amZxIbcjZISU&amp;refer=home\">Bloomberg</a> last week was quoting one expert saying that by the end of 2009, \"about 100 US banks with collective assets of more than $800 billion will fail.\" That prediction comes from Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. Whale thinks the FDIC could suffer losses of $200bn, far above its reserves. Should the FDIC start to go under, Congress doubtless will rush to its aid. That would mean another massive bailout, this one perhaps on the very eve of the presidential election - or the inauguration of the unlucky man who wins it.</p>",
  "<p>President McCain or President Obama? Who do the Tories support in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">US election</a>? These intriguing questions attracted a full house to a breakfast time fringe meeting at the Tory conference in Birmingham today. And it soon became clear that, for many Tories, the answer is not necessarily the obvious one.</p> <p>Two years ago, John McCain jetted across the Atlantic to speak at the Tory conference in Bournemouth, David Cameron's first as leader. He was not at that time \u2013 even before the 2006 midterms \u2013 even close to being the Republican nominee to succeed George Bush. McCain came as an outsider, and he spoke ineffectively and too long, failing to connect with his audience. It seemed in some ways an odd gamble for the new look Tories to take. Still, the link between McCain and the Tories seemed sufficiently strong to suppose that, if McCain actually emerged in 2008, he would be the Tories' man.</p> <p>And yet when, a year ago at the Tory conference in Blackpool, with the US presidential election still only a subject for political anoraks, I buttonholed <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/People/Peers/Neville-Jones_Pauline.aspx\">Pauline Neville-Jones</a>, the former chair of the joint intelligence committee turned Tory peer and shadow cabinet member, and asked her who she wanted to win the 2008 election, her answer was immediate: Hillary Clinton. We'll definitely be able to work with her, said Neville-Jones. Not like McCain or the neoconservatives.</p> <p>A year on, and now there has of course been another massive turn of the wheel in American politics. Clinton's moment has been and gone. Now Barack Obama is the frontrunner and McCain has overturned the odds on the Republican side. He has nominated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> as his running mate. So where do the Tories stand amid all this change?</p> <p>Instinctively, I think most would prefer McCain to Obama. The reason is not complicated. Tribes of the right stick together. Yet Palin has shaken some of that resolve. Whenever her name was mentioned at the fringe meeting, there were intakes of breath and shakings of the head. Not many 2008 Tories, even the elderly ones, feel at ease with an anti-abortion, anti-climate change, pro-gun, religious conservative with zero experience of international politics. Here, as in America itself, the choice of Palin has led a lot of moderate conservatives to question McCain's judgment.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, I bumped into the shadow cabinet member <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/francismaude\">Francis Maude</a> at the Democratic convention in Denver. Are you heading to the Republican convention next week, I asked him. Not me, he responded. We are the insurgents and so are the Democrats. The Republicans and Labour are the incumbents. This is the conference for us to learn from.</p> <p>Maude was there again in Birmingham on Monday morning. This time he was more circumspect. I have a preference, he said, but not in public. But I have a prediction, he added \u2013 that John McCain will win in 2008, will serve a single term as president and that the 2012 contest will be between Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin. \"Book your seats now,\" said Maude.</p> <p>That was one of two good lines to come out of an otherwise inconclusive fringe. The other \u2013 and I record this merely for the benefit of posterity and the compilers of dictionaries of political quotes \u2013 came from Richard Nixon. No, Tricky Dicky wasn't back from the grave to be with us in Birmingham today. But his son-in-law Ed Cox, the very much alive chairman of the McCain campaign in New York, was. One of McCain's virtues, in Cox's view, was that he is a staunch free trader. \"My father-in-law always used to say 'Free trade is good policy but bad politics',\" Cox recalled. Head and heart always did have an uneasy relationship in Nixon's politics. And the same is true for the Tories when they look at the contest between McCain and Obama. I think a lot of them would be comfortable with McCain \u2013 but I also think they suspect Obama would be the right choice.</p>",

  "<p>Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has made a remarkable announcement. He's admitted that Iran might agree to the existence of the state of Israel. </p> <p>Ahmadinejad was asked: \"If the Palestinian leaders agree to a two-state solution, could Iran live with an Israeli state?\"</p> <p>This was his astonishing reply:</p> <blockquote> <p>If they [the Palestinians] want to keep the Zionists, they can stay ... Whatever the people decide, we will respect it. I mean, it's very much in correspondence with our proposal to allow Palestinian people to decide through free referendums.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since most Palestinians are willing to accept a two-state solution, the Iranian president is, in effect, agreeing to Israel's right to exist and opening the door to a peace deal that Iran will endorse.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad made this apparently extraordinary shift in policy during an <br><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/09/25/2008-09-25_mahmoud_ahmadinejad_ok_we_may_have_a_few-2.html?page=0\">interview</a> last week when he was in New York to address the UN general assembly. </p> <p>He was interviewed on September 24 by reporters Juan Gonzalez, writing for the New York Daily News, and Amy Goodman for the current affairs TV programme, Democracy Now. </p> <p>You can watch the full interview and read the full text on the <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/9/26/iranian_president_mahmoud_ahmedinejad_on_iran\">Democracy Now website</a>.</p> <p>Surprisingly, Ahmadinejad's sensational softening of his long-standing, point-blank anti-Israeli stance was not even headlined by the two reporters. Perhaps this was a decision by their editors? Did they not want to admit that Ahmadinejad may have, for once, said something vaguely progressive? </p> <p>Equally odd, the story wasn't picked up by the world's media. For many years, the Iranian president has been vilified, usually justifiably. Now, when he says something positive and helpful, the media ignores it. Is this because of some anti-Iran or pro-Israel agenda? </p> <p>Why ignore a statement that is, from any political and journalistic perspective, a radical departure from Ahmadinejad's previous unyielding anti-Israel tirades? Only a week earlier in Tehran <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/saturday-magazine/features/ahmadinejad-says-israel-wont-survive-935088.html\">he was saying</a> that the Israeli state would not survive. </p> <p>Confused? Aren't we all. Will the real Mahmoud Ahmadinejad please stand up? </p> <p>Is he a deceiver and an unprincipled opportunist who will say anything to further Iran's political agenda? Or could it be that beneath his often demagogic public rhetoric against Israel he is, in fact, open to options more moderate than his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel\">reported remarks</a> about wiping the Israeli state off the map?</p> <p>I am not defending or endorsing Ahmadinejad in any way, shape or form. Indeed, I am on record as being one of Ahmadinejad's harshest critics. I've protested dozens of times outside the Iranian Embassy in London and written scores of articles exposing his regime's persecution of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/iran.middleeast\">trade unionists</a>, students, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/iran.humanrights\">journalists</a>, human rights defenders, <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/peter_tatchell/2007/03/tehrans_heroic_women.html \">women's equality campaigners</a>, gay people, Sunni Muslims and <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/peter_tatchell/2007/09/iran_executes_more_arabs.html \">ethnic minorities</a> such as the Arabs, Kurds, Azeris and Balochis. </p> <p>You can watch my Talking with Tatchell online TV programmes on the Iranian regime's anti-Arab racism <a href=\"http://www.veoh.com/videos/v15577546TBcXNG8w\">here</a>, and on the rising popular resistance to its police state methods <a href=\"http://www.veoh.com/videos/v155586882MaWkMXM\">here</a>.</p> <p>But I also hope I am open-minded and fair. Even I can see that Ahmadinejad appears to have moderated his position and is now apparently willing, with Palestinian agreement, to accept the co-existence of two states: Israel and Palestine. </p> <p>Many Israelis and their allies will no doubt say Ahmadinejad can't be trusted; that his comments were part of a manipulative charm offensive during his visit to the UN in New York. They may be right. But even if he is being disingenuous, that fact that he's made this public concession on Israel at all is a softening of sorts. </p> <p>News of what he said will filter back to Tehran and he'll have to account for his words to his government, including the hardline anti-Israel ayatollahs and revolutionary guards. I wonder what they think? </p> <p>Call me naive, but in my view Ahmadinejad's words were of major significance. He ought be pressed by world leaders, and Israel, to repeat them and to clarify them. His statement might, and I emphasise might, be evidence that Iran is open to some negotiation on the future of the Israeli state. </p> <p>If Israel's leaders had any sense, they would ignore past provocations by Iran and seize this moment to have dialogue with the Palestinian and Iranian leaders on a two-state solution. What Ahmadinejad has said could be an opening to diffuse the stand-off between Iran and Israel. </p> <p>I am not relenting one inch in my condemnation of Ahmadinejad's regime, with its grisly torture chambers, execution of juvenile offenders and neocolonial subjugation of national minorities. But I do find myself in considerable agreement with the Iranian president's analysis of why the Middle East peace process has stalled. He told Gonzales and Goodman:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first reason is that none of the solutions have actually addressed the root cause of the problem. The root cause is the presence of an illegitimate government regime that has usurped and imposed itself on, meaning they have brought people from other parts of the world, replaced them with people who had existed in the territory and then forced the exit of the old people out, the people who lived there, out of the country or the territories. So there have been two simultaneous displacements. The indigenous people were forced out and displaced, and a group of other people scattered around the globe were gathered and placed in a new place ... A second reason is that none of those peace plans offered so far have given attention to the right to self-determination of the Palestinians. If a group of people are forced out of their country, that doesn't mean their rights are gone, even with the passage of 60 years. Can you ignore the rights of those displaced? How is it possible for people to arrive from far-off lands and have the right to self-determination, whereas the indigenous people of the territory are denied that right?</p> </blockquote> <p>Much as I loathe his regime, Ahmadinejad is basically right. The key to peace in the Middle East is concessions from the occupying power. As the stronger, wealthier and conquering partner, Israel should take the initiative and help kick-start the peace process by withdrawing unilaterally and totally from the territories it has occupied illegally (according to international law) since the 1967 war. This means pulling out from all of the West Bank and dismantling all the illegal Israeli settlements. </p> <p>The West Bank, plus Gaza, should become the independent, sovereign state of Palestine, backed with international aid and investment to create the infrastructure for economic development and for social provision (new houses, schools, hospitals, transport links and sports facilities). </p> <p>Jobs and prosperity in Palestine will undercut and isolate the men of violence. They will lose support and become marginalised in a self-governing state where ordinary Palestinians experience the tangible benefits of peace. </p> <p>This is so damn obvious. When will Israel's leaders wake up and realise that peace with justice is the only way to give their people lasting security?</p>",
  "<p>British ports will begin inspecting air freight and shipments of imported food from tomorrow in a major food safety operation triggered by the contaminated milk scandal in China.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency put more than 80 ports and airports on alert yesterday and ordered health officials to intercept and test any food products arriving via China that contain more than 15% milk, including cakes, chocolate, biscuits, bread and protein drinks.</p> <p>The action followed moves by the European Food Standards Agency last week to prevent dairy products contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine entering member states. Baby formula contaminated with melamine has killed at least four children in China and made tens of thousands ill, leading to widespread bans on imports to 12 countries.</p> <p>Europe, meanwhile, had already banned all imports of animal products, including baby formula, from China several years ago. The latest safeguards are designed to intercept other products called \"composites\" that also contain milk or milk powder in lower quantities.</p> <p>Officials at the Food Standards Agency met with importers yesterday to agree a list of foods that port health authorities must check consignments for. Any product with more than 15% milk content must be tested for melamine, along with foods where the milk content cannot be established. </p> <p>Importers who have food on route to Britain from China, Singapore and Hong Kong were asked to submit paperwork to help ports establish which products need testing. Legal documents giving ports the power to conduct the inspections and tests were drawn up last night.</p> <p>Impounded food must be sent for independent testing at laboratories such as the government contractor, the LGC in Teddington near London. Food that tests positive for more than 2.5mg of melamine per kilo will be reported and destroyed. The Food Standards Agency said all costs for the operation would be borne by companies whose products were sent for testing.</p> <p>Last night, chief port health officials said the scale of the operation could be vast, particularly at key ports in London, Southampton and Felixstowe. </p> <p>\"Food products tend to come in mixed packages, so if we have to start unpacking containers, it could become a very big job. There's also a lot of food labelling that doesn't give percentages of ingredients,\" said one port authority official.</p> <p>Tests for melamine usually take one to two days, but delays could run into weeks if lab build-up backlogs of food that requires testing.</p> <p>At the weekend, the World Health Organisation said the devastating impact of the contamination in China had been \"aggravated\" by officials failing to report the problem quickly enough.</p> <p>Melamine was added to baby formula to bulk it up, but in some cases reached levels 100 times higher than a baby can tolerate. The chemical, used to make plastics and foams, can cause bladder and kidney stones when ingested.</p>",
  "<p>The apparent failure of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a> to block the formal indictment of its president for war crimes is threatening to plunge the country into renewed internal conflict, provoke a break with the UN and end cooperation of African Union countries with the international criminal court.</p> <p>Tribunal judges are expected to rule within the next two months on a request by the international criminal court chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, for an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir concerning war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur. Although action on the most serious allegation of genocide may be deferred, the other charges are almost certain to go ahead.</p> <p>Addressing the UN general assembly last week, Sudan's vice-president, Ali Osman Taha, <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28745\">warned Khartoum</a> would view an arrest warrant as tantamount to a declaration of war by the western powers. \"Realisation of peace in Darfur and in [southern] Sudan, and the steps taken by the ICC, are two parallel lines that can never meet,\" he said.</p> <p>Bashir's spokesman, Mahfuz Faidul said Sudan was pursuing a peace initiative in Darfur and was considering independent prosecutions of alleged wrongdoers. If the ICC went ahead, <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2397299,00.html\">he said</a>, Khartoum's response \"will be nothing less than ending all our agreements with the UN\". That could entail the expulsion of UN peacekeeping missions, aid agencies and NGOs in Darfur and the south.</p> <p>Sudan wants the UN security council to invoke Article 16 of the ICC charter, which keeps a case frozen for 12 months at a time. Its stance has won backing across the developing world, including the African Union, the Arab League, the Islamic Conference Organisation and the Non-Aligned Movement. </p> <p>\"Africa believes that the stability of Sudan is too important to be jeopardised by an abrupt adoption of a regime change policy, and that justice should be pursued in the context of peace,\" Sudan expert Alex de Waal <a href=\"http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/darfur/2008/09/23/africas-position-on-the-icc/\">explained recently</a> in his Social Science Research Council blog. </p> <p>He said Jean Ping, chairman of the AU commission, had suggested African states might freeze their cooperation with the ICC because of its perceived double standards.</p> <p>\"Ping noted that 30 African countries had ratified the ICC's Rome statute, expecting that the ICC would aid them in the pursuit of justice. But rather than pursuing justice around the world - including in cases such as Colombia, Sri Lanka and Iraq - the ICC was focusing only on Africa and was undermining rather than assisting African efforts to solve its problems.\"</p> <p>Activists passionately oppose freezing the case against Bashir. \"A suspension of the investigation would deny justice to the thousands of victims in Darfur,\" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. A statement by more than 100 Darfuri and Sudanese diaspora groups, published by the Save Darfur Coalition, warned a freeze would \"embolden a government in Khartoum which has repeatedly broken promises\".</p> <p>Britain and France appear caught in two minds, anxious to prevent both a collapse in support for the ICC and a new descent into violence in Sudan - including the collapse of the already frail Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that ended the north-south civil war. </p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, suggested last week that an Article 16 deal was possible, but only if the Sudanese government met stringent prior conditions such as ending all violence in Darfur. That seems unlikely since Darfur is not wholly under Khartoum's control.</p> <p>Although it is not a party to the ICC, the US is taking a tougher line. Richard Williamson, the US special envoy to Sudan, told a Congressional hearing here last week that \"as of today\" Washington would veto any security council move to defer or block Bashir's prosecution. He said he expected a court decision within two months.</p> <p>At the same time, Williamson admitted that the 2006 Darfur peace agreement had failed, CPA implementation was in serious trouble, that \"the necessary elements to ensure free and fair elections\" in Sudan next year did not currently exist, and that the 2011 referendum on southern secession was also in question.</p> <p>He drew particular attention to recent attacks on Kalma refugee camp and across north Darfur. Government troops, \"under the guise of a new law and order campaign to bring security to Darfur, are killing innocent civilians and creating more chaos in the region ... The mayhem, murder and misery continues,\" he said.</p> <p>Khataza Gondwe, of Christian Solidarity Worldwide, told the hearing yet another crisis was developing in the central Nuba mountains as Arab militia associated with atrocities in Darfur moved into the area.</p> <p>John Prendergast, co-chair of the Enough Project and a former Clinton administration Africa policy director, said nothing less than a multinational, UN-backed \"peace surge\" backed by an option for military intervention was needed to stop a descent into anarchy in Sudan. But while his and similar recommendations arise from genuine concern to help, the African argument, backed by most non-western actors, is that such interference may do more harm than good. The impasse over the ICC is only hardening. A train wreck looms.</p>",
  "<p>Nine Nobel Laureates, including the South African campaigner Desmond Tutu and the German novelist Gunter Grass, join forces tomorrow with more than 100 celebrities from the arts, law and media to protest the on-going detention by the US government of five Cubans imprisoned for allegedly spying on behalf of the Cuban government.</p> <p>The so-called Miami Five were sentenced in 2001 to prison terms of between 15 and 25 years for allegedly acting as Cuban agents within the exile community in Miami. </p> <p>The men and their supporters have consistently protested that they had come to the US to infiltrate and disrupt right-wing exile groups perpetrating acts of terrorism within Cuba.</p> <p>To mark the 10th anniversary of the arrests of Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo, Ramon Labanino, Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez and Rene Gonzalez, full-page adverts are being taken out in the Guardian and the Independent tomorrow. </p> <p>They claim that the men were unjustly jailed, and protest against the refusal to allow the wives of two of the prisoners to visit them from Cuba for up to 10 years.</p> <p>Signatories to the adverts include the designers Vivienne Westwood and Jasper Conran, artist Howard Hodgkin, writers Iain Banks and Harold Pinter and actors Julie Christie and Susannah York.</p> <p>The case of the Miami Five has attracted the attention of international human rights groups.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5\">State intervention and nationalisation</a>are both back with an incredible bang. Suddenly, the neoliberal orthodoxy of \"Tina\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TINA\">\"there is no alternative\"</a> \u2013 to the free market looks as hollow as Brown's promise to end the cycle of boom and bust. It reconfirms that in this age of hyper-globalisation and neoliberalism, the state and market regulation are still important.</p> <p>The bail-outs we've seen in Britain and the US are nationalisations by the neoliberals and for the bosses. If they were carried out at the behest of the left and for the workers, taxpayers and citizens, they would look entirely different.</p> <p>So when the senior management was changed when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7249575.stm\">Northern Rock</a> was nationalised one set of capitalist managers was merely replaced by another. The same will be true of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The nationalisations were not to safeguard jobs or workers' conditions or people's savings but the British financial system upon which profits heavily depend. </p> <p>If the left is to make headway right now, it must start getting its ideas about public ownership out into the media, into union members' heads and onto people's radar screens.</p> <p>The left needs to start off with what public ownership is and what it is not. This would make it clear the left was not calling for a return to the age of nationalisation, where civil servants ran the industries in an undemocratic and unaccountable ways. Jobs were not safeguarded and services were often poor. It would also make it clear the left was not calling for a situation of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy\">command economy</a>, where the centre dictated what was produced without consulting the consumers and the localities.</p> <p>The lessons of history are that while coordination and planning are needed, there should be decentralised structures that allow participation and that the process is one of bottom-up democracy, not top-down diktat. </p> <p>One model of public ownership, for say, transport would be that the boards of management consist of a third of seats allocated to representatives from the travelling public, a third from the workforce and a third from the local authorities. Here, there would be a balance between producer and consumer interests.</p> <p>The issues to be resolved would include whether the unions would be the only representatives of the workforce, whether businesses would be entitled to seats and whether local authorities are closely connected enough to be the genuine representatives of the public at large. </p> <p>Another model would be that all members of the board of management would be elected directly by citizens and those wishing to be board members stand on platforms of representing workers', business and passengers' interests and so on. </p> <p>These are all issues which can be explored in more depth later once the debate has been won on the need for this version of public ownership. The key thing here is that the primary purpose of these services (including financial services) being in public ownership would be that they are run on the basis of social need and not private profit.</p> <p>What this means is that the constitution or articles of association of these organisations would be changed from the objective of pursuing private shareholder interests to providing services. The organisations would not then have to be concerned with chasing profits, market value, market share or being taken over by a rival.</p> <p>The banks would then operate under this system by creating social justice and social inclusion by keeping open wide branch networks (with one in each community), practice safe lending, work by the principles of ethical investment and return surplus back into their operations to increase service provision. </p> <p>The way in which the left can do this is by questioning each and every action of the governments by saying \"Whose interests are being served by this?\", \"Whose money is being used for this?\" and \"If public money is being used, where is the public control?\" </p> <p>There is a role for left MPs like <a href=\"www.johnmcdonnell.org.uk/\">John McDonnell</a> in laying bills before parliament to put organisations into public ownership instead of allowing this Labour government to remain the bankers' friend by doling out hand outs to them. </p> <p>The unions need to use their influence inside and outside parliament to support these moves. Rather than being overly fixated on windfall taxes and curbing bonuses, they could tackle the underlying causes \u2013 rather than just the symptoms \u2013 by supporting social ownership. The odd call for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/23/energy.utilities\">public ownership of the utilities</a> needs to be made writ large.</p>",

He's telling the audience he was surprised by last week's result so warns that we shouldn't assume tonight's winner.</p> <p>Mike has just had to tell the younger members of the audience who Lord Baker is, to much hilarity.</p> <p>John Whittingdale, hitting the bottle of water, is now pitching for Thatcher. He says that of the four candidates she is the most controversial.</p> <p>He says her place in history is assured - she's the longest serving PM of modern times and the first female PM. All remarkable.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>6.10pm:</strong> Back when she was chosen, he says, electing a female leader was regarded as an aberration and it was thought that \"the party would soon return to its senses\". The audience titters at this.</p> <p>Whittingdale now describes the dire economic conditions of the late 70s, and says that the economic reforms Thatcher put in place are responsible for the economic success the UK has since enjoyed.</p> <p>Laughter now at the idea that Thatcher's privatisation of elements of the UK could ever be reversed. They are laughing because we've just had a second bank nationalised.</p> <p>Now he says, the biggest redistribution of wealth was achieved by Thatcher through the sale of council houses.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>6.15pm:</strong> And what of personal courage? He says she had that too. Airey Neave murdered just before she became PM ... Other instances showed she had mettle. Against all the threats on her life and her political standing, \"she did not back down, she did not surrender\".</p> <p>She went to war over the Falklands \"to defend the right of her own citizens to determine their own future. She did so against the advice of her own Foreign Office and cabinet ministers.\"</p> <p>Thatcher restored pride. \"Most important of all was the role she played in the alliance with [Ronald] Reagan [the former US president], which brought to an end the cold war.\"</p> <p>Whittingdale sums up: \"She didn't just change Britain, she changed the world,\" and gets loud applause.</p> <p>Mike White now asks panellists to turn off their mobiles, before realising it is his own causing the interference. Hmmm.</p> <!-- Block 6 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338100145\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/09/29/argles33233223222.jpg\" alt=\"David Willetts at a Guardian debate on the Tories' greatest hero, at the Conservative conference in Birmingham on September 29 2008.

Photograph: Martin Argles</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <strong>6.15pm:</strong> David \"Two Brains\" Willetts on Benjamin Disraeli now. Big picture of Disraeli appears on the screen behind our clever five men on the panel.</p> <p>Two Brains says Disraeli created the party everyone in the hall now supports. Then they had 30 years in opposition. \"In that period we could well have disappeared. Or, if not disappeared, have become a backward-looking, peasants', country party.\"</p> <p>Step forward Disraeli, Willetts says. \"Putting the condition of England question at the heart of the Conservative party ... to become an urban political force. Only because of this it was able to engage with modern problems. No other political leader since has had a comparable effect.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6.20pm:</strong> Challenges he faced: the divided nation. Disraeli brought the two together for the first time after 30 years in opposition. That's why DW choses Disraeli.</p> <p>If DW is Two Brains, how many would he give Disraeli?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6.20pm:</strong> I have to say DW is very brief in his pitch - impressively so.</p> <p>Now, on to the third pitch. Kenneth Baker on Winston Churchill.</p> <p>\"This isn't a seminar... The Guardian wants to identify who you want to [influence] David Cameron. That's what they'll make of it in the Guardian tomorrow. Just you wait and see.\"</p> <p>Baker says - to the loudest applause yet - that Churchill wouldn't have made it into the hall since we all had to leave our wine glasses at the door.<br> More seriously: Churchill got Hitler when most of the country didn't.</p> <p>\"Showed judgment in the war again. Then, after the war, he was the first major politician to realise the party had changed.\"</p> <p>There was, Baker says, one speech - not often talked about - that he made at the time. He realised that the special relationship with America was only one of the special relationships the country needed.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6.30pm:</strong> \"He has a tremendous symaptico with ordinary people that none of these people had - certainly not Disraeli\" - a little laugh - \"and certainly not Margaret Thatcher\". Hearty laughter from all of the audience. </p> <p>\"The great contribution Britain could make was as a nation state, not in Europe.\" Churchill always put Britain first, Baker says.</p> <p>Loyalty, courage, and a passionate love of his country. Wonderful oratory too.</p> <p>Baker winds up and I actually think his applause is the loudest.</p> <p>Mike White is just saying how interesting it is what the panellists have been leaving out so far.</p> <p>Now, Michael Gove on Burke.</p> <p>\"He is the most ancient figure of these four,\" says Gove.</p> <p>\"All the other candidates are celebrities ... could be on a political X Factor ... Disraeli is flashy - a Victorian Jeffrey Archer [howls of laughter]. Margaret Thatcher - did what Edna Everage did for Australian comedy [no laugh] ... If you vote for any of them you are voting for the Simon Cowellisation of politics.\" This audience love Gove.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6.35pm:</strong> \"Burke ensured that there was rich stock of ideas, concepts and arguments which Conservatives will use for time to come.\"</p> <p>One of his first acts in the House of Commons was to limit the rights of the monarchy. He rebelled against bullying. Burke first raised the standards for individual constituents against arrogant, centralising authority.</p> <p>He fought against corruption and arrogance, pressed for political emancipation.</p> <p>At the time of the American revolution it was Burke who pointed out that you can't have taxation without representation.</p> <p>But while he recognised liberty was important, he also understood where authority needed to be recognised, so he became a trenchant opponent to tyranny on the European continent. Fundamentalism took hold of Europe at that time. Burke saw this.</p> <p>He saw that if you pursue utopian politics you usher in hell on earth. The audience is rapt.</p> <p>Churchill, Thatcher, Disraeli, they would not have been possible without Burke, Gove asserts. \"In that respect, he is the daddy of them all.\"</p> <p>Gove winds up. Thunderous applause. No idea who has the heart of the audience right now. Let's see.</p> <p>Mike is going to abuse his position as chair and ask some of his own questions.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> The first is about how Disraeli was a romantic imperialist. Willetts says this is not relevant any more. A little slap down to my colleague? Or fancy footwork?</p> <p>Baker joins in, saying he doesn't agree that Disraeli did have that much of an effect. Disraeli actually, Baker says, only mentioned one-nationism once in his books and never mentioned the concept in his speeches. So, Disraeli debunked by Baker.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> There is now some toing and froing on a Disraeli call for an aristocratic House of Lords, proof, Baker says, that Dizzy was not that radical.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> Whittingdale weighs in, dragging things back to Thatcher. He makes the point that three of the panel worked for Thatcher. \"And worked against her,\" Mike White says. A little laugh.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> Gove now says that Churchill was the leader of a one-man party - albeit a fantastic party - and life with him was one long party. But Burke was about the wider party, not a cult to himself.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> Baker makes a point about Burke. Gove strives to intervene and then gets a laugh for calling Baker's comments \"off beat\".</p> <p>I think Baker has called Burke \"the candidate of torpor\". Gosh.</p> <p>Mike White: \"David Willetts, you've got lots of GCSE\" - laugh - \"who else [would he pick]?\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> Hayek would also be up there. Oakeshott. Adam Smith. David Hume. Incredible flowering of the British enlightenment, but great thinkers are not the same as great leaders.</p> <p>We're now going to questions.</p> <p>Councillor Fiona Guest gets to her feet and says Thatcher got to the top without being a feminist. \"Without being an A-lister either,\" says Whittingdale, being a little rude about the mechanism Cameron used to try to get more female candidates into the party.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>6.50pm:</strong> Baker is now saying: \"She was such a phenomenon but was she a Conservative? I doubt it. I never heard her say the word Tory nor use the word Conservative - or at least only to describe this conference.\"</p> <p>Mike now tries to draw Baker on the plots to overthrow Thatcher. Baker tells Mike to read his memoirs.</p> <p>Was it treachery? Whittingdale says yes. Willetts says the Labour party should read the history books before it does in Brown.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>6.55pm:</strong> Now to Alex Williams's question: was Churchill a success because of the time he was PM, the 1940s?</p> <p>Baker says he is sure he would have been a success any time on account of his activities before the second world war, yes. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" says Mike, \"but it did take Hitler to rescue his career.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, but that was his strength, dear boy,\" Baker says.</p> <p>Next question: what did these marvellous politicians do wrong? </p> <p>He supplements with some points of his own. Churchill got India badly wrong. As for Disraeli, he was a bit of a charlatan.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> Mike then asks the clever audience member whether he has any dirt on Burke, who was briefly paymaster-general. Gove butts in: \"He certainly didn't lend [Peter] Mandelson money for that mortgage.\"</p> <p>Whittingdale says that Thatcher regrets taking Britain into the ERM. \"Every leader who takes bold, courageous decisions is going to make mistakes.\"</p> <p>Gove makes this striking point: \"All of the people on the panel were all outsiders.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> Mike asks Gove what this tells him about the Tory party.</p> <p>\"People have this caricatured view of the Conservative grassroots, that grassroots are only really happy if it is an identikit male figure ... No, the whole point about the Tory party is that it has throughout its history been far more relaxed - someone of talent, no matter what their background, can put something right.\"</p> <p>We're entering the home straight since I think another fringe event is due to get the room. Last few questions.</p> <p>A lady called Lynn stands up and says she looks for someone who speaks to her heart - Hague did it yesterday. Churchill did it.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> Whittingdale concedes that Thatcher wasn't very good at telling jokes in her speeches and says one of the more surreal moments in his career was sitting in her office watching the dead parrot scene again and again ... Then, as she was going on stage to deliver the speech she turned to Whittingdale and said, \"John, Monty Python, are you sure that he is one of us?\"</p> <p>A clever question: who would be the panellists back if they didn't back their own choice?</p> <p>Whittingdale's second: \"I think I would support Churchill.\"</p> <p>Gove's second: Churchill.</p> <p>Willetts's second: Thatcher.</p> <p>Baker didn't say.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> Whittingdale concedes that Thatcher was socially divisive. \"Yes, there are people who do still hate Margaret Thatcher.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> Last question. Thatcher famously said \"Everyone needs a Willy.\" Who would the other candidates' Willy be?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Gove: \"I am very proud of our Willy: William Hague. The ideal elder statesman and he's still only 46.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Down to business ... the vote. Burke gets a good show of hands - more than I expected. Quick size up: about a third of the audience.</p> <p>Now Churchill. Actually seems to be a little less.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Disraeli now and he gets a handful. Someone in the audience asks: \"Are you allowed to vote twice?\" Mike White: \"No, Disraeli got rid of that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>And lastly Thatcher. She has won overwhelmingly but let's have the numbers.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> The very lovely Carla now walks the results on stage.</p> <p>Burke: 52.</p> <p>Thatcher: 97</p> <p>Well, there we are.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>7.20pm:</strong> Interestingly, a greater share of the people in this room voted for Burke than did Tory MPs when asked a similar question.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>7.25pm:</strong> Well, there we are. The room empties. The result wasn't even close; the Tory faithful still love Thatcher and they needed no persuading of it. But I imagine you need persuading. Tell us what you think ... Who is your greatest Tory?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>7.40pm:</strong> The results in full.</p> <p>Public vote:</p> <p>Burke: 52<br>Churchill: 53<br>Disraeli: 18<br>Thatcher: 97</p> <p>MPs' vote:</p> <p>Burke: 22<br>Churchill: 47<br>Disraeli: 27<br>Thatcher: 48</p> <p>Incidentally, Mike White asked Cameron yesterday at a reception who his own greatest Tory hero was. Cameron replied: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Peel\">Sir Robert Peel</a>, the Tory leader who was PM in the 1830s and again in the 1840s. </p> <p>His reason was that he wanted the party to do better in Lancashire.</p>",
  "<p>State schools are being \"smothered\" by red tape and government dictates and should be given the freedom to set their own curriculum and appoint staff that private schools and academies enjoy, according to an influential private school headteacher. </p> <p>Tim Hastie-Smith, chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents 250 leading private schools, told the group's annual conference in London today that barriers between the private and state sector are coming down but that standards in government-funded schools are inhibited by political interference. </p> <p>The National Union of Teachers, which represents teachers largely in the state sector, said his comments were \"ill-conceived\" and that the independence private schools have of the government is an \"irrelevance\" to most state schools. </p> <p>Hastie-Smith, the headmaster of Dean Close school in Cheltenham, who earlier this month announced that he plans to leave his present post to become principal of a new academy being planned for Kettering, said: \"The independent sector has held firm over the years to the belief that education, if it is to achieve true excellence and if it is to be tailored to the needs of the individual child, should be free of government control.\"</p> <p>He said that the argument for independence had been won in the government's \u2013 and opposition parties' \u2013 support for state-funded but privately run academies. \"The philosophical argument for centralised education, driven and controlled by a centrist government, is beginning to be seen as bankrupt.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"Now that we have won that argument, the challenge is to press government to give real and lasting independence to the state sector, to support and encourage where we can the spread of independence, and to continue to demonstrate the enduring importance of independent education, which is one of this country's most valuable resources.</p> <p>\"Free from political control, free from the red tape and dictates which can smother our colleagues in most of the maintained sector; and with that freedom and independence comes a responsibility that we must inevitably take on because others won't.\"</p> <p>Bridges are been built with the state sector and \"distrust and suspicion\" was being \"stripped away\", he said. Referring to research that demonstrated that children in different types of schools are divided by a perception of a \"chav-snob\" divide, he said schools should move to work together to break down those divides. </p> <p>Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"If the chair of the HMC really wants to understand state schools he needs to understand that schools in the state sector are completely committed to equity and they work within the local authority family of schools and understand the need for local demographic accountability and the need for cooperation with each other. These are virtues, not a hindrance in the state sector. </p> <p>\"These are the issues that Tim Hastie-Smith wants to grapple with if he wants to have a proper working relationship with state schools \u2013 not pre-conceived prejudices about schools striving for independence.</p> <p>\"What he needs to do is engage critically with aspects of the flawed government agenda including academies. He has to understand that academies are an irrelevance to most schools and schools want to work together to achieve high standards for all.\"</p> <p>The HMC has commissioned research from Professor Alan Smithers, the respected University of Buckingham academic, due to be published tomorrow, which will set out the contribution private schools make to the economy and education system. It will argue that the independent sector is responsible for keeping the UK near the top of international educational league tables.</p>",
  "<p>Stockmarkets slumped around the world today amid a flurry of major bank bail-outs and growing fears over the effectiveness of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/28/us.bail.out.congress.deal\">$700bn (\u00a3380bn) US rescue package </a>for the financial industry, which goes to Congress later today.</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/wachovia.us.banks\">Wachovia's share price was virtually wiped out</a> after it agreed to a rescue takeover by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/citigroup\">world's biggest bank, Citigroup</a>. </p> <p>Shares in Wachovia, once America's fourth-largest bank, dived 90% to below 70\u00a2 when Wall Street opened.

Crude for November delivery dropped $3.73 to $103.16 a barrel in New York. Sterling was on course for its biggest one-day percentage loss against the dollar since the middle of 1993, after hitting a 10-day low of $1.7962, down 2.3%. The euro also lost more than 2% against the dollar to a 10-day low of $1.4310. </p> <p>\"The crisis has taken on a more international complexion with B&amp;B and Fortis,\" said Daragh Maher, a senior currency strategist at Calyon. \"There is a worry whether there is the ability or the willingness within Europe for a US-style response.\" </p> <p>The controversial <a hef=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/\">US deal </a>was reached over the weekend after days of tense wrangling between the Bush administration and lawmakers, and authorises the government to purchase $700bn of troubled debt from banks.

There have been so many constraints put on the deal that any one of those could completely limit its effectiveness.\"</p> <p>Under the proposal, the US government could access $250bn immediately, $100bn more if the president certified it was necessary, and the last $350bn with a separate certification - and subject to a congressional resolution.</p> <p>Matt Buckland, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: \"The fact the funds won't be released in one lot but instead a series of tranches is certainly detracting from its appeal and this, combined with the very visible scars of the credit squeeze, will again weigh in sentiment.\" </p> <p>Following a weekend of intense negotiations in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5\">the chancellor, Alistair Darling, announced this morning</a> that the government would take control of B&amp;B's \u00a341bn of mortgages, along with all its other debts.</p> <p>Its branch network was taken over by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/santander\">Spanish banking giant Santander</a>, which owns Abbey and is in the process of acquiring Alliance &amp; Leicester.</p> <p>Nearly all Asian stockmarkets slid, with Japan's Nikkei closing down 1.3% at 11,743.61 points and Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunging 4.3% to 17880.68. </p> <p>Rob Carnell at ING in London said: \"The [US] plan was not quite the pure financing bill Secretary Paulson would have liked it to be ...

  "<p>The publisher whose home was targeted in a firebomb attack on Saturday will be going ahead with putting out a controversial novel about the child bride of Muhammad next month, despite this weekend's events.</p> <p>London-based Gibson Square acquired journalist Sherry Jones's novel The Jewel of Medina earlier this month after Random House US dropped the novel following warnings that it could provoke terrorist actions from radical Muslims.</p> <p>On Saturday, what is believed to have been a petrol bomb was thrown through the doorway of publisher Martin Rynja's home in Islington's Lonsdale Square, which doubles as the offices for Gibson Square. Three men have since been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.</p> <p>But Natasha Kern, Jones's agent, said \"publication is going ahead in both the US and UK. This is one of the primary reasons we chose Gibson Square and Beaufort Books - we knew they would be courageous and get the book in print quickly.\" </p> <p>The Jewel of Medina will be published on October 30 in the UK and October 15 in the US, although Jones's US publisher Beaufort Books has closed its offices today as a precautionary measure. \"They [Beaufort Books] are meeting with local law enforcement. They have not received any threats but it's as a precautionary measure,\" said a spokesman for Beaufort Books.</p> <p>Rynja himself could not be reached for comment. Speaking to the Today programme this morning, author Sherry Jones said Rynja was \"a very courageous man, a strong advocate of free speech who went into publication of this book knowing there might be controversy or perhaps even violence. He did this with his eyes wide open, and because he believes in my book and he believes in free speech.\"</p> <p>Jones criticised American academic Denise Spellberg, a professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, who had described the book as \"softcore pornography\" in the US media.</p> <p>\"She used the most inflammatory language she could possibly have used. If you want to incite heated emotions from any religious group you just use the word 'pornography' in the same sentence as their revered figures,\" Jones said.</p> <p>\"She ought to take back her words because it is in no way an accurate description of my book. There are no sex scenes in it.\" </p> <p>She added: \"I don't blame Denise Spellberg for this attack, I blame the people who resorted to violence. I'm sure Ms Spellberg never wanted to incite violence, in fact she said her reaons for objecting were the opposite. But I fear she has created a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"</p> <p>The Jewel of Medina is a first person narrative from the perspective of Aisha, one of Muhammad's wives. It steers clear of graphic details about the sexual relations of Aisha and Muhammad, but does touch on their love life. \"This was the beginning of something new, something terrible. Soon I would be lying on my bed beneath him, squashed like a scarab beetle, flailing and sobbing while he slammed himself against me. He would not want to hurt me, but how could he help it? It's always painful the first time.\"</p> <p>Jones had previously told the Guardian that she did not believe there was any risk of violent protests over the novel's publication. \"Frankly I'm more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks,\" she said. \"I did expect my book would be controversial, just because I'm a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own \u2026 [but] my aim was not to provoke, it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era, and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in Islam.\"</p> <p>Jones said that she had been in contact with Rynja and that he was \"fine\". \"He's unharmed,\" she added.</p> <p>Jones said she was still planning to visit the UK for publication next month. \"My intention is that if Martin Rynja is courageous enough to proceed with publication, I am certainly courageous enough to come to Britain.\" She said she was not concerned for her safety. \"There is no indication this is the beginning of a larger movement ... It doesn't seem to me from where I sit that this was an actual assassination attempt.\"</p> <p>Jones also said she would be writing to London-based lawyer and cleric Anjem Choudhary, who has been quoted calling the book an insult to Muhammad's honour, which he said would warrant a \"death penalty\" under sharia law. \"He is quoted as saying that my book is insulting to Muhammad and it is anything but ... in fact it honours him,\" she said, \"and for a western non-Muslim woman to do that, makes it even more important.\"</p>",
  "<p>Oh boy, what great timing. Last Friday, on the 20th anniversary of the publication of Salman Rushdie's <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DF163FF93AA25753C1A96E948260\">The Satanic Verses</a>, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/26/islam.religion\">wrote a piece</a> arguing the case that, in my view, many Muslims who had once supported the banning/pulping of the book had since revised their views and recognised that such actions were quite wrong and completely counterproductive. </p> <p>Noting that another controversial novel, <a href=\"http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/islamsadvance/2008/08/censoring_islam.html\">The Jewel of Medina</a> \u2013 which is said to be about the Prophet Muhammad's relationship with his youngest wife, Aisha, and has been described as \"softcore pornography\" by one American academic \u2013 was due to be published next month by the UK publishers, Gibson Square, I said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Already emails are being circulated calling on British Muslim organisations to mobilise to try and stop its publication. Will they try and do so? I really hope that appropriate lessons have been learned from the Satanic Verses affair and that British Muslims do not take the bait.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, that very night, it transpires that three men were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/28/muhammad.book.attack\">arrested</a> by anti-terrorist officers during an apparent arson attack on the home of the proprietor of Gibson Square publishers, Martin Rynja. <br> Writing in the Times today, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4842288.ece\">Kenan Malik argues</a> that while the opponents of The Satanic Verses may not have been able to prevent its publication, they have managed to win the war:</p> <blockquote> <p>There will always be extremists who respond with fire. There is little we can do about them. The real problem is that their actions are given a spurious legitimacy by liberals who proclaim it morally unacceptable to give offence.</p> </blockquote> <p>I agree with Malik about the extremists \u2013 they are best dealt with through a mixture of good intelligence and upholding of the law \u2013 but the second sentence strikes me as being pure twaddle. If anyone has given ground in this debate, it is surely those who once believed in banning books because they regarded them as being \"offensive\". </p> <p>It may well be true that there is greater recognition in society that it is quite rude to casually denigrate entire cultures or peoples \u2013 but that is surely a point about changing notions of civility in a pluralist world; it is not about the \"right to offend\". I have not come across many liberals who would deny the right of Rushdie or the Jewel of Medina author, Sherry Jones, to write books that might cause offence to others. </p> <p>Now, back to those would be arsonists. Whatever their motivation may have been and however genuine their sense of outrage over a novel which they cannot yet have read, they clearly crossed a line that should not be crossed and they can presumably \u2013 and quite rightly \u2013 expect to be prosecuted for doing so. </p> <p>To those who are sending out emails urging Muslim organisations to call for the Jewel of Medina to be banned on the grounds of \"provocation\", just imagine if members of the BNP were to threaten to riot because they found the publication and distribution of the Qur'an to be offensive \u2013 would we consider withdrawing copies of the Qur'an? Of course, we would not. </p> <p>There is a real risk that the reckless actions of a few people such as Friday's would-be arsonists could make this situation much worse than it otherwise need be. Is it not far, far better to leave Jones and her publishers well alone to promote and distribute their book and instead to focus one's energies in using the same freedoms and liberties to promote the message of the Prophet Muhammad? </p> <p>That would be a far more honourable and fruitful tribute to him than calling on the publisher to reconsider publication of the book.</p>",
  "<p>Plans to almost double the number of single rooms in hospitals were unveiled by the Conservatives at their conference in Birmingham today.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said that the Tories aimed to increase the number of single rooms in wards by 45,000 in the party's first term in government, to nearly 100,000. The proportion of beds in single rooms would increase from 28% to 55%.</p> <p>Under the plan all maternity and mental health patients would be allocated a single room. Thirty-five per cent of single rooms would go to those admitted to hospital for an operation. </p> <p>The Tories also hope that the increase in single rooms allocation would limit the spread of hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA. Single rooms for those who have already contracted such infections would increase by 7%.</p> <p>The move, which would cost \u00a31.57bn over five years - about \u00a3300m a year - would be paid for by reallocating money in the capital funding budget. The Conservatives say that last year this budget was underspent by \u00a32.9bn.</p> <p>Lansley said: \"By giving NHS patients the choice of a single room when they book their operation, we will ensure that they will be treated with the dignity they deserve. Any stay in hospital is a traumatic and trying time. We hope that the proposals we are announcing will make a big difference in removing unnecessary stress for patients and their families.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives said the plan was part of a wider shake-up planned for the NHS \u2013 under which health professionals would be given power to manage their own hospitals and surgeries and would be expected to compete to attract patients. Centrally set targets would go and doctors would reassume control of decision-making.</p> <p>Different providers would be encouraged to deliver healthcare while treatment would remain free at the point of use. Oliver Letwin, the Tory policy chief, said on Sunday night at a fringe event that this was a \"treasured principle\".</p> <p>Labour said that all the policies were current practice already. Ann Keen, the junior health minister, said: \"There seems to be little new here. The government is already encouraging choice for patients and a diversity of providers within NHS tariffs.</p> <p>\"The real danger for patients is that the Conservatives would scrap the maximum 18-week wait from diagnosis to treatment. They would scrap the four-hour maximum wait in A&amp;E and the two-week maximum wait for suspected cancer patients to see a consultant. Andrew Lansley needs to explain exactly how patients would continue to benefit from such short waiting times if he plans to scrap these targets.\"</p> <p>At the weekend, speaking on Sky's Meet the Experts panel, David Cameron outlined Tory health proposals. \"At the moment, [Labour] are regulating it through processed targets, how many hours do you spend in A&amp;E, how many days do you wait for this or that. They are not measuring what really matters: if I get cancer do I survive, if I have a stroke what is my quality of life going to be like? We want to measure and eventually reward those on the NHS by outcome.\"</p>",
  "<p>Standing next to France's President Sarkozy, the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh today made a heartfelt plea over the spread of anti-Christian violence in India. The sight of Hindu mobs smashing churches and prayer halls while Christians in the country are killed or left cowering under tarpaulin sheets in refugee camps is, as Dr Singh rightly described, a <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/PM_to_Europe_Well_protect_Christians/articleshow/3541497.cms\">\"national shame\"</a>. There are calls from within the ruling Congress party, which relies on the votes of Christians and Muslims in India, to ban Hindu extremist organisations such as the Bajrang Dal, which uses force when the force of argument fails. </p> <p>There has been bloodshed on both sides. One Christian priest was \"cut to pieces\" in front of his wife. A Hindu priest was shot dead for campaigning against religious conversions. The violence, which has left nearly two dozen dead, has spread across six states. Even after the Pope intervened, the Roman Catholic archbishop of one of the worst affected areas in eastern India said the situation was <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/29/stories/2008092955551200.htm\">\"out of control\"</a>. </p> <p>What lies behind this violence is nothing less than a struggle for the soul of India. Religion is deeply rooted in this country of one billion. The divine was fundamental in the creation of post-independence India. Unlike Europe, in India the Gods will not disappear in a blaze of rational thinking. </p> <p>But views of God led to a schism in Indian nationalism. One side is rooted in secular thinking: that beneath the differences among India's religions there is a common creed, a moral order articulated in the country's constitution. Opposing this is the Hindu right. Their philosophy aims to unify the country under the banner of the majority religion. It sees the country's post-independence constitution as an instrument forged by \"pseudo-secularists\", which now needs to be updated to reflect the Hindu character of India. </p> <p>Christians in India long pre-dated the British, who sponsored missionary activity with little success. In 1947, only 3% of the country was Christian. There's an unmistakable tint to Christianity in India: the priests are mostly upper-caste Brahmin converts and the flock is mostly drawn from the country's untouchable communities known as Dalits. Contemporary Hindu anger centres on the idea that India's rise will see an explosion of Christians in the country \u2013 a takeover by a foreign ideology like that experienced by South Korea in the 1960s. </p> <p>The Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata party, says it is against <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/26/stories/2008092657561200.htm\">proselytisation</a> through coercion, inducement, or by vilifying any faith. That conversion continues, therefore, and that it remains legal, drives Hindu groups into a bloody frenzy. By decrying the violence but remaining powerless to prevent it, the Indian prime minister exposes his strength and weakness. The Indian federal government could suspend state administrations \u2013 for failing to quell violence. This is the nuclear option of <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Sep202008/scroll2008092091069.asp\">unseating</a> a democratically elected local regime. Instead, the Indian prime minister chooses only speak up. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum\">Martha Nussbaum</a>, the noted American philosopher, draws a comparison with 1950s America where only a few groups such as the Ku Klux Klan would openly advocate violence, but \"where the whole society was suffused with attitudes that \u2026 often condoned violence against African Americans, attitudes that clearly affected the behaviour of the police and other officers of the law\". This remark is telling because, in the southern Indian town of Mangalore, it was Christian churches that were attacked, yet the leaders of Hindu mobs walked free for days, untouched by the police. </p> <p>The violence is the really about the clash within. Like the United States, India has never had a state-imposed religion. It has always had a tradition of sects and religious minorities, which coexist and compete with each other without suffering state persecution or patronage. Instead of trying to capture state power for the purpose of waging a cultural war, the Hindu right would do the country a service by reforming itself from within \u2013 promoting equality and unifying its own denominations and sects. </p> <p>Religion's role in India must be one of restraining passions, not inflaming them.</p> <p><em>To keep up with Randeep Ramesh's blog from India, go <a href=\"http://www.randeepramesh.blogspot.com\">here</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Most authors of books on politics or economics are happy when they get one or two prominent members of Congress to endorse their work. It looks like I'm about to get majorities of both chambers to endorse my book, <a href=\"http://www.conservativenannystate.org/\">The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer</a> (free download available). There is no other way to describe Henry Paulson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/useconomy.wallstreet\">$700bn bail-out deal</a>.</p> <p>The point of my book is that the battle between progressives and conservatives is not about a policy of government intervention as opposed to free market policies. Rather, it is a battle between those who want to use the government to benefit the middle and bottom of the income distribution and those who want to use the power of government to redistribute income upward.</p> <p>The bail-out is a big victory for those who want to redistribute income upward. It takes money from school teachers and cab drivers and gives it to incredibly rich <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street</a> bankers. These bankers have in turn distinguished themselves by their incompetence, having driven their banks into the ground. </p> <p>This upward redistribution was done under the cover of crisis, just like the war in Iraq. But there is no serious crisis story. Yes the economy is in a recession that is getting worse, but the bail-out will not get us out of the recession, or even be much help in alleviating it.</p> <p>The best argument that the bail-out proponents had was that the failure to do the bail-out could lead to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/24/AR2008092403033.html\">collapse of the financial system</a>, leaving us unable to use credit cards or ATMs, or otherwise conduct normal financial transactions. This would indeed be scary, since it would imply a complete economic collapse. (I had actually accepted this line.) </p> <p>Actually this was entirely an idle threat. In the event the banking system really did freeze up, then the Federal Reserve would step in and take over the major banks. (It had contingency plans for such a takeover in the 1980s, when the money centre banks were saddled with billions of dollars of bad developing country debt.) </p> <p>The banks would not be happy about a Fed takeover. The top executives would be out of their jobs, and the shareholders would likely lose their full investment. However, the rest of us would be able to carry on with our lives as we did before. After maybe a few hours of disruption, we would be able to cash checks and use credit cards and ATMs just as we did before the crisis. </p> <p>In effect, the big banks had a gun pointed at their heads. The banks told Congress that if they didn't get $700bn, then they would pull the trigger. Given this choice, Congress coughed up the cash.</p> <p>While the final version is an improvement over the original request, there is little by way of hard commitments on the key points. Which executives will see their pay limited and by how much? How much equity does the government get for buying the banks' bad debts? How many mortgages will be renegotiated? If this were a serious bill, there would be specific wording on these points. </p> <p>Henry Paulson did not sign a contract when he was CEO with Goldman Sachs that gave him \"fair compensation\". He signed a contract that specified that he would get tens of millions of dollars in salary and bonuses. Similarly, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/warrenbuffett.wallstreet\">Warren Buffet invested $5bn in Goldman</a>, he got a 10% stake in the bank, not a generic promise of \"equity\". That is the way business is usually done when people are serious. </p> <p>The bill also does not change the bankruptcy rules to allow people to stay in their homes. Nor does it provide for any real stimulus. Undoubtedly, the spending on the bail-out will be used in future months as an argument against real stimulus.</p> <p>Wall Street may have won this one, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/business/29econ.html?hp\">this is the battle not the war</a>. The whole country now knows that these millionaire and billionaire high-flyers are the biggest bunch of welfare cheats around. The folks with the yachts, private jets and personal servants lack the skills and diligence to make it on their own. They need the tax dollars from the rest of us to make ends meet.</p> <p>Every progressive in the country should be working to ensure that this bail-out is incredibly costly for the Wall Street crew. They should wish that they never took our money.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5\">nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> could cost other high-street banks billions of pounds if the government makes a loss on the troubled lender's outstanding mortgages.</p> <p>Under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 \u2013 which was passed in February this year to allow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">the nationalisation of Northern Rock</a> - the government can claw back any losses from the UK's financial services industry.</p> <p>The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is borrowing \u00a314bn from the Bank of England to finance the deal, under which the government takes control of \u00a341bn of mortgages while Spain's Santander pays just over \u00a3400m for B&amp;B's branch operations and savers - and receives \u00a34bn from the taxpayer.</p> <p>The first payments on this loan will fall due next September, when the industry will face a levy of around \u00a3450m. That is a massive increase on this year's \u00a35m levy.</p> <p>The FSCS said this morning that similar interest payments will be levied again in September 2010 and 2011, suggesting that the cost of servicing the Bank of England loan will exceed \u00a31bn.</p> <p>After three years, any loss incurred by the government will also fall on the industry - even though the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB are already being battered by the credit crunch.</p> <p>Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, confirmed that the banking sector will pay the price of B&amp;B's fall.</p> <p>\"It's a big sum of money, there's no two ways about it,\" said Knight. However, there is no suggestion that the BBA's members might fight the levy.</p> <p>\"At the moment, people are getting on with the business of doing business,\" Knight added.</p> <p>FSCS chief executive, Loretta Minghella, admitted that the compensation demands were coming at a difficult time.</p> <p>\"In contributing to this initiative, the FSCS is helping to support consumer confidence in the financial services industry,\" Minghella said today.</p> <p>Because B&amp;B is the UK's biggest buy-to-let lender and also deeply involved in self-certification mortgages, there are concerns that the government could struggle to avoid making a loss when it runs down its mortgage book.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, insisted today that nationalisation would avoid chaos in the sector. But with house prices still falling and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/29/mortgages.property\">mortgage lending at its lowest level ever</a>, Darling gave no guarantee that losses could be avoided.</p> <p>\"The first way of redeeming the costs that we are incurring comes from redeeming the assets of Bradford and Bingley. If that isn't enough, then there will be a claim under the compensation scheme,\" he said.</p> <p>Darling also flagged up that B&amp;B's loan book is not of the highest quality. \"It does have more buy-to-let and self-certification mortgages - where, frankly, people just said what they earned and that figure was taken as fact \u2013 than we would like.\"</p> <p>Under the deal announced this morning, the Treasury is handing Santander \u00a34bn to cover those retail deposits that are not covered by the FSCS. That \u00a34bn is top of the list to be repaid once B&amp;B's assets are sold off, followed by wholesale deposits, and then the \u00a314bn loan.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Calgary, Canada. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Mark Hamilton (guitars, vocals, glockenspiels), Kenna Burima (piano), Michael Gratton (bass), Annalea Sordi (accordion, flute, vocals), Daren Powell (drums), Peter Moersch (electric guitar, vocals), Foon Yap (strings), AJ Benoit (vocals). With various other musicians on banjo, mandolin, brass, backing vocals and something called \"tsunami guitars\".<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Woodpigeon are a musical collective from Canada, each of whose members plays with a number of other local groups \u2013 one of their side projects is The Summerlad, who did a show on Valentine's Day where they played nothing but My Bloody Valentine covers. They're also a vehicle for the \"sad words wrapped in pretty pop music\" of frontman, guitarist and songwriter Mark Hamilton, who moonlights as a journalist. He is Woodpigeon and so are they \u2013 all eight of them, plus the additional members from various places across Canada who do everything from play sax to help with the stage visuals and provide remixes. <br> Confused? At least he/they aren't trading under their original unwieldy name: Woodpigeon Divided By Antelope Equals Squirrel (or W/A=S for short). Apparently \"woodpigeon\" is one of Hamilton's favourite words because \"it looks like a rollercoaster when it's written in cursive\". Sure it does. Just like a rollercoaster. And \"Mark Hamilton\" looks like a swan wearing a Pac-A-Mac abseiling off a cliff when you see it translated into Aramaic.  Apart from their name, Woodpigeon are an intriguing proposition. They're a sort of semi-acoustic Arcade Fire or a full-band version of Sufjan Stevens. Their lushly orchestrated folk-pop, featuring wispy boy-girl harmonies, posits them as a cross between Prefab Sprout and Fairport Convention. Some of their songs are simple and unadorned while others are more ornate and complex. Mostly, they specialise in twinkling melodies that feature layered arrangements and build to epic climaxes.  They're also notable for their long-winded song-titles such as Home as a Romanticized Concept Where Everyone Loves You Always and Forever, A Sad Country Ballad for a Tired Superhero and In the Battle of Sun Vs. Curtains Sun Wins and We Sleep Until Noon, which is about depression and a medical condition called hyper-insomnia. One of their tunes, Death by Ninja (A Love Song), is an ode to the titular Japanese martial arts warriors that opens with the immortal line, \"I went to ninja school to learn how to murder you with just one little punch\".

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/stokecity\">Stoke City</a>'s Liam Lawrence is an injury doubt for his side's weekend meeting with Portsmouth after tripping over his pet dog. The former Sunderland winger suffered the bizarre injury to his ankle this morning, leaving the Potters manager Tony Pulis with a potential selection headache for Sunday's fixture.</p> <p>\"He has stepped over his dog on the stairs and his ankle just gave way and he went over on it,\" said Pulis. \"The initial scan has shown no break but we have sent him back for another x-ray to make sure.</p> <p>\"We don't know how serious it is at the moment, he may be okay for Portsmouth, but then again he may not be fit. We will have to wait and see.\"</p> <h2>Football's most ridiculous injuries</h2> <p>\u2022 Lawrence is not alone in suffering at the paws of a mutt. <strong>Chic Brodie</strong>'s career came to an abrupt end in October 1970 when the Brentford goalkeeper collided with a sheepdog that had run on to the pitch, shattering a kneecap. \"The dog might have been a small one, but it just happened to be a solid one,\" he said. The former Barnsley midfielder <strong>Darren Barnard</strong>, however, was sidelined for five months with a torn knee ligament after he slipped in a puddle of his puppy's urine on the kitchen floor.</p> <p>\u2022 The Everton goalkeeper <strong>Richard Wright</strong> was ruled out of an FA Cup fourth-round replay at Chelsea after twisting his ankle by falling over a sign warning him not to practice in the goalmouth during the pre-match warm-up. He also damaged his shoulder by falling through a loft as he was trying to pack away his suitcases. Wright's former Ipswich team-mate <strong>Kieron Dyer</strong>, then at Newcastle, damaged his left eye when he collided with a pole in training.</p> <p>\u2022 During his spell at Leeds United, the England defender <strong>Rio Ferdinand</strong> picked up a tendon strain in his knee after leaving his leg propped on a coffee table for too long while watching television. Ferdinand's England colleague <strong>David James</strong> also suffered at the hands of the TV when he pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the remote control. James also tweaked his shoulder while attempting to land a carp while fishing.</p> <p>\u2022 The then Kidderminster captain <strong>Sean Flynn</strong> broke his nose, bust his lip and bruised his toes after tripping over his son's toy cars. But a real car accounted for the toy-sized <strong>Alan Wright</strong>, who strained his knee by stretching to reach the accelerator in his new Ferrari. He subsequently swapped the sports car for a Rover 416. The former Leeds and Blackburn midfielder <strong>David Batty</strong> injured his Achilles tendon when he was run over by his toddler on a tricycle.</p> <p>\u2022 In 1993 the goalkeeper <strong>Dave Beasant </strong>dropped a bottle of salad cream on his foot, severing the tendon in his big toe and keeping him out of action for eight weeks. Similarly, the Spain goalkeeper <strong>Santiago Canizares</strong> missed the 2002 World Cup after accidentally shattering a bottle of aftershave in his hotel sink. A piece of glass fell on his foot, severing a tendon in his big toe.</p> <p>\u2022 In 1975 the Manchester United goalkeeper <strong>Alex Stepney</strong> dislocated his jaw while shouting at his defenders during a match against Birmingham. Meanwhile England's <strong>Alan Mullery</strong> missed the 1964 tour of South America after injuring his back while brushing his teeth - not a problem for the American international <strong>Kasey Keller</strong>, who knocked out his front teeth while pulling his golf clubs out of the boot of his car.</p> <p>\u2022 The Arsenal striker <strong>Charlie George</strong> cut off his toe with a lawnmower, but the then-Aston Villa forward <strong>Darius Vassell</strong> missed several games after he drilled through his toe nail with a home power drill thinking it would relieve the pressure on a swollen toe. It developed an infection that required medical attention.</p> <p>\u2022 And finally, the Norway defender <strong>Svein Grondalen</strong> had to withdraw from an international during the 1970s after colliding with a moose while out jogging.</p>",
  "<p>Eleven European tourists and eight local guides kidnapped 10 days ago in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\">Egypt</a> have been rescued by troops and special forces, officials said today.</p> <p>The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian were rescued in an overnight operation by Egyptian and Sudanese forces near the Sudan-Chad border, an Egyptian security official said.</p> <p>The Egyptian defence minister, Hussein Tantawi, said half of the kidnappers were killed in the rescue operation, according to the state news agency Mena. The report did not give a precise number or details on the rescue.</p> <p>The Italian foreign minister, Franco Frattini, suggested Italian and German special forces were involved. He told the Sky TG24 news channel that Sudan and Egypt carried out \"a highly professional operation\" with the \"intervention of Italian intelligence and experts from the special forces\" from Germany and Italy.</p> <p>The tourists and local guides and drivers were taken to Cairo and were understood to be in good health.</p> <p>The group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/egypt.sudan\">disappeared on September 19</a> while on a desert safari trip in a remote corner of south-western Egypt. </p> <p>The breakthrough in the hunt for the tourists came yesterday when Sudanese forces in north-western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a> fought a gun battle against a group of the kidnappers who had been sent out to get fuel and food, the Egyptian security official said. </p> <p>Six kidnappers were killed in that fight, and two captured. The two told the authorities where the rest of the kidnappers and their captives were hiding, the official said.</p> <p>The Sudanese and Egyptian militaries, using two helicopters, launched the assault that freed the captives, two security officials said. One said there was an exchange of fire and that the hostages were freed inside Chadian territory, but there was no confirmation of where exactly the assault took place. </p> <p>Yesterday, a Sudanese military spokesman, Sawarmy Khaled, said Sudanese soldiers had been combing the Jebel Oweinat region near the Libyan border when they came upon a white sports utility vehicle carrying eight gunmen.</p> <p>\"The armed forces called for it to stop, but they did not respond and there was pursuit in which six of the armed men were killed,\" he said. The dead included the leader of the group, whom Khaled identified as a Chadian named Bakhit.</p> <p>German officials had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/egypt.middleeast\">demanding millions of dollars in ransom</a>, according to Egyptian officials, while Sudanese and Egyptian forces were searching for the abducted group.</p> <p>The kidnappers were believed to be desert tribesmen. Tour operators working in Egypt's western desert have reported several robberies of tourists in the area by heavily armed gunmen in SUVs and expressed fears that the violence could be a spillover from the conflicts in eastern Chad and Darfur.</p> <p>The vast majority of Egypt's 9 million tourists each year visit pharaonic sites along the Nile or Red Sea beach resorts, far from the Western Desert and the Gilf al-Kebir. The Gilf, a desert plateau 500 miles south-west of Cairo, draws adventure tourists with its sand dunes and desert cliffs, as well as a trove of prehistoric cave art. Around 2,000 tourists visited the area in the past year, up from only a handful less than a decade ago.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in Britain's banks plunged today in febrile market conditions caused by bail-outs of banks in the UK, continental Europe and the US.</p> <p>The nationalisation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a>, the rescue of Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis and the rescue takeover of US bank Wachovia by Citigroup further hit sentiment in an already nervous market.</p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland tumbled by over 20%, while Lloyds TSB lost 15% and HBOS shed 12.5% - putting their merger in doubt.</p> <p>Under the deal hammered out during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.marketturmoil\">a weekend of intense negotiations</a>, the taxpayer is taking on B&amp;B's \u00a341bn of mortgages and handing Spanish giant Santander \u00a34bn to persuade it to take on the Yorkshire-based firm's savers and branch network. </p> <p>The cost of the deal, including hundreds of millions of pounds in interest payments on a \u00a314bn loan that underpins the deal, could <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking7\">eventually fall on the UK's banks</a>. </p> <p>They could also face further losses in three years if the government cannot recover these costs.</p> <p>Lord Turner, head of the Financial Services Authority, warned that the nationalisation of B&amp;B is not the end of the banking crisis.</p> <p>\"We are not necessarily right at the end of this process,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. \"At the moment we believe our other high street banks are well capitalised and in a reasonable condition but we will have to keep this situation under review.\" </p> <p>As well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/29/insurance.europeanbanks\">the bailout of Fortis</a> by the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and Citigroup's takeover of Wachovia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/icelandiceconomy.banking\">the Icelandic government has taken control of the country's third-largest bank, Glitnir</a>.</p> <p>The sharp banking losses <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/marketturmoil.bradfordbingley\">knocked 213.3 points off the FTSE 100 index</a> by 3.15pm today, sending it 4.2% lower to 4875.2.</p> <p><strong>Fear in the market</strong></p> <p>The mood was little better on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones lost over 300 points in early trading despite overnight progress on the $700bn banking bailout.</p> <p>Analysts were mesmerised by the share price movement in Lloyds TSB and HBOS, following the \u00a312bn takeover agreed two weeks ago. Analysts said it showed the level of fear in the market.</p> <p>\"I'm trying to be open-minded about other surprises there might be,\" said James Eden of Exane BNP Paribas.</p> <p>\"Can you imagine Lloyds walking away from HBOS? I can't image they would. The share price is telling you there is a chance of that happening,\" Eden added.</p> <p>B&amp;B is the biggest buy-to-let operator in the UK, and was unable to continue operating in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">the ongoing crisis in the financial markets</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, insisted that he was taking \"decisive action\" to avoid the troubled lender going bust, which would have \"destabilised the whole industry\". </p> <p>This comes seven months after the government nationalised Northern Rock. Alex Potter, analyst at Collins Stewart, commented today that the taxpayer now owns two of the most poorly performing loan books in the country.</p> <p>As well as the mortgage book, the government will take control of B&amp;B's personal loans, along with all its other debts and its headquarters.</p> <p>Santander, which already owns Abbey in the UK and is buying Alliance &amp; Leicester, is paying a total of just over \u00a3400m for B&amp;B's branches and its 2.7 million customers, whose savings total \u00a320bn. It agreed the deal in return for \u00a34bn from the taxpayer to cover retail deposits that are not protected under UK law.</p> <p>B&amp;B is particularly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">exposed to the falling housing market</a> because of its focus on buy-to-let and self-certification mortgages. Darling confirmed that any losses will be clawed back from rival banks, who have weathered the ongoing financial crisis better than B&amp;B.</p> <p>\"We are not going to do that immediately, because in the current climate that would be absolutely daft. But it does mean that as things get better, if there is a shortfall then we will collect it from the industry,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Savers saved</strong></p> <p>Shares in B&amp;B were suspended this morning, having fallen by 93% this year to just 20p. Its investors will be wiped out following the deal.</p> <p>Standard Life Investments is the largest single shareholder in B&amp;B with a stake of just under 10%. It said it was disappointed that the bank had fallen into public ownership.</p> <p>\"As long-term shareholders we stood by the company and supported its recent fundraising. This regrettably did not lead to the desired outcome,\" said David Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life Investments.</p> <p>Legal &amp; General, which also backed the rights issue, said: \"We are disappointed that a well-capitalised bank which in more normal circumstances might have been expected to trade through its current difficulties has been nationalised.\"</p> <p>The government insisted today that deposit-holders will not suffer from nationalisation.</p> <p>\"Branches will be open this morning as usual, and internet, call centre, and all other transaction services will operate as normal,\" explained the Treasury.</p> <p>Many of B&amp;B's workforce would have woken up to find that they are now employed by Abbey, which Santander owns.</p> <p>\"They should all attend their workplace in the normal way. Savers' money remains absolutely safe and secure. Borrowers should continue to make their payments in the normal way,\" the government added.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, suggested that in the long run the deal could be beneficial for taxpayers.</p> <p>\"The UK government is getting these assets for free. So it could turn out to be quite a good deal,\" Cable said on the BBC Today programme.</p> <p>Darling himself was 40 minutes late for his slot on Today.</p> <p>\"Rather unusually, the chancellor is not available. He's having a rather busy day,\" commented presenter Evan Davis.</p> <p>After the deal was confirmed, Darling crossed swords with shadow chancellor George Osborne, who said that the collapse of B&amp;B showed that \"you can't build an economy on debt\".</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of landlords who took out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/buyingtolet\">buy-to-let</a> mortgages with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> face an anxious wait to see whether the Treasury will honour the terms of their deals that have left them \"significantly better off\" than many other borrowers.</p> <p>The newly nationalised bank was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking1\">UK's largest buy-to-let lender</a> through its Mortgage Express brand. It specialised in the buy-to-let market and there had been fears it could hike up loans for borrowers in a bid to persuade them to remortgage to a new lender at the same time as other banks and building societies are pulling out of the market or repricing their loans upwards.</p> <p>After the government took control of Northern Rock last year it made a similar attempt to reduce the lender's loan book by cutting the most competitive rates and withdrawing cheap deals to those coming to the end of fixed-rate loans.</p> <p>However, one expert on the buy-to-let mortgage market said it might not be so easy for it to do the same at B&amp;B. According to Lee Grandin, managing director of specialist broker Landlord Mortgages, the lender has a clause in its mortgage contracts that states customers coming off cheaper fixed-terms deals can only be charged a standard variable rate (SVR) of base rate plus 1.75%.</p> <p>With the base rate currently at 5% this is one of the best buy-to-let deals on the market by some margin. </p> <p>Within hours of the news that B&amp;B was effectively nationalised, HBOS subsidiary Birmingham Midshires announced it was raising the cost of its buy-to-let mortgages. The Mortgage Works, which is owned by the Nationwide building society, also pulled its landlord deals and was expected to follow the Midshires' lead and reprice upwards. </p> <p>Other buy-to-let lenders have effectively closed their doors to new business in the face of the credit crisis that has left the sector severely wounded. </p> <p>\"My advice to B&amp;B customers at the moment is not to panic,\" said Grandin. \"Those coming off a fixed-rate or other incentivised deal will automatically be put on the SVR, which at the moment is the best place to be.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Who's going to switch away from B&amp;B unless they are forced to? In the long term it will be up to the government to decide whether it will honour those terms - it could face a number of legal wrangles if it ripped up borrowers' contracts.\" </p> <p>Martin Lewis, founder of Moneysavingexpert.com, warned that forcing B&amp;B's struggling mortgage customers elsewhere could send many buy-to-let landlords to the brink.</p> <p>\"This wouldn't be a problem in a normal mortgage market, but right now, especially for those who've overborrowed, it's incredibly tough to get a new deal,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This could leave many sitting at an unfeasibly high rate, unable to deal with it. I'd urge the government to take great care; if not we could start to see nationalised repossessions.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Treasury indicated that the government was likely to try to avoid legal disputes with B&amp;B's borrowers.</p>",
  "<p>Norway is <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080929/ap_on_hi_te/eu_norway_itunes\">pushing ahead with its mission</a> to get <strong>Apple</strong> to change its long-running locked down content system.

(<strong>To clarify</strong>: It's the Apple DRM on top of the AAC that locks tracks into Apple, and also the premium open format is AAC, not MP3.)</p> <p>Its rivals, including UK store <strong>7digital</strong>, have been quick to exploit what is widely seen as one of Apple's major shortcomings in the download market. 7digital <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/sep/16/netmusic\">last week announced</a> that its store now offers tracks from all four major labels in MP3, open format - though that move is unlikely to do much to dent Apple's whopping 70% share of the UK's legal digital downloads market.</p> <p>Norway has been chosen for the test case that Thon has been co-ordinating for two years with colleagues in France, Germany, Finland and Denmark.</p> <p>\"It's a consumer's right to transfer and play digital content bought and downloaded from the internet to the music device he himself chooses to use,\" said Thon. \"iTunes makes this impossible or at least difficult, and hence, they act in breach of Norwegian law.\"</p> <p>\"iTunes has now had two years to meet our demands regarding interoperability. No progress has been reported by iTunes since our meeting in February.\"</p> <p>If successful, Apple will forced to open up all the tracks in the iTunes Store. It has until November 3 to reply to Erik Thon. This is being seen as a major test case for Apple and the consumer rights movement, though the verdict isn't due until early next year.</p> <p>This isn't the first time Apple has run up against European concerns about unfair consumer practices, previously deriding a proposed French bill on open DRM technology in 2006 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4833010.stm\">\"state-sponsored piracy\"</a>.</p> <p>Apple chief executive <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> appeared to change tack slightly after that, writing a now famous <a href=\"http://networks.silicon.com/webwatch/0,39024667,39165671,00.htm\">open letter to record companies</a> urging them to switch to open DRM models.<br></p>",
  "<h2>On Labour and big money</h2> <p>Our economy suffers from a crisis of confidence. And our government is all crisis and no confidence. The Brown boom has ended in bust.</p> <p>Unlike New Labour we are not bedazzled by big money. We respect wealth creation but unlike New Labour we don't fawn over it. It wasn't New Labour who was the first to say that the non-doms should pay their fair share. And it wasn't Conservatives who opposed a temporary ban on short-selling. We know what Gordon Brown is trying to do. He wants to blame the right for the failures of the left.</p> <h2>On the Tories' ability to form government. </h2> <p>And so the British people turn to us for leadership. They want to know the answer to two questions: are you up to it, and will you make a difference? And this week we will show them. Yes, we are. And yes, we will.</p> <h2>On City financiers</h2> <p>I am not going to blame everything on the bankers alone. But nor am I going to excuse them of their responsibility, or allow them to think that things can carry on as before.</p> <p>\u2026 If you take risks, then you must bear the cost. If you pay yourself sums far beyond what anyone else does in any other walk of life, then be prepared to lose it when you make mistakes. If you pay out big dividends when you should be rebuilding balance sheets, then you will be held to account.</p> <p>I will not increase taxes on the family earning \u00a320,000 to carry on paying the bonuses of the banker earning \u00a32m. You helped cause this mess and you can help pay to clear it up.</p> <h2>On who is to blame for the current crisis</h2> <p>I am not going to claim that this problem only exists in Britain or that it is all the fault of the current government. But nor will I let them forget who sat there in the Treasury for 10 years while the regulation failed, the debt soared and no one called time on the \"age of irresponsibility\".</p> <h2>On the causes of the crisis</h2> <p>For a decade the whole world enjoyed the good times \u2013 and nowhere was the boom greater than here in Britain. We borrowed and borrowed as if the party would never end. Banks did. Businesses did. Families did. And so did this government. And then, like any party that goes on too long, things got out of hand.</p> <p>Gordon, you won't get away with blaming us for casino capitalism when you're the man whose been running the casino and collecting in the chips for the last 11 years.</p> <h2>The solution to the crisis</h2> <p>We will bring fiscal responsibility to our government. And we will bring financial responsibility in our economy. We will make sure that this mess never happens again.</p> <h2>On helping families struggling with rising bills</h2> <p>We will cut your petrol taxes as oil prices rise. We will get you on the lowest rates for your gas and electricity. We will take young families facing higher mortgage costs permanently out of stamp duty. We will give companies facing bankruptcy a breathing space to protect your job. We will abandon Labour's grotesquely ill-conceived and ill-timed new tax on family cars. We will not leave you alone in this crisis.</p> <h2>On taxation</h2> <p>Gordon Brown will do anything to avoid telling this country the truth. So as he won't, I will.</p> <p>The cupboard is bare. There is no more money. Tax revenues have collapsed. Unemployment costs are rising. Borrowing is out of control. Labour has done it again.</p> <p>It's no good talking about the big up-front tax giveaways we might like to make, or the big spending increases it might be nice to have. Because I repeat: there is no more money.</p> <p>Our goal over time will be to balance the current budget and ensure falling national debt. We will put sound money first.</p> <p>Before we can cut taxes we have to stop taxes rising. The whole country is having to tighten its belt and save money. So too should their government.</p> <p>I can tell you today that the next Conservative government will freeze your council tax for at least two years. Every council tax bill of every family in every council that takes part will be frozen.</p> <h2>On Gordon Brown's 'problem'</h2> <p>He really thinks that his problem with the British people is that he's too serious and doesn't smile enough.</p> <p>He just doesn't get it. Being too serious isn't his problem.</p> <p>His problem is that he promised prudence and then spent and borrowed his way into a record budget deficit.</p> <p>His problem is that he promised fairness and then so cynically posed as a tax cutter on the backs on the poorest with the 10p tax rise.</p> <p>His problem is that he promised dignity in retirement and then his first act was to raid the pots of those who had saved for their pension.</p> <p>His problem is that he told us like some Old Testament prophet that he alone had abolished the economic cycle.</p> <p>His problem is that through his hubris and his arrogance he left Britain so badly prepared when the cycle turned.</p> <h2>On an end to stop-go economics</h2> <p>Gordon Brown told us he had ended \"stop-go\". No more \"boom and bust\", he promised.</p> <p>Well, now the boom is over and the bust has come. And the message to Gordon Brown from the British people is simple. Stop. Go.</p>",

  "<p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, has won a referendum on a new constitution that will implement leftist reforms, including increased state control over monetary and oil policy.</p> <p>Preliminary results showed 65% approval, with almost half of the votes counted. An opposition leader told Reuters than Correa had won. </p> <p>Correa is an ally of the socialist regimes in Venezuela and Bolivia, although his reforms are less radical than those of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or Evo Morales. </p> <p>The new constitution contains a number of provisions aimed at the 38% of Ecuadorians who live below the poverty line. It guarantees free education up to and including university, increased spending on health, low-interest micro-loans, building materials for first-time homeowners and free seeds for growing crops.</p> <p>Correa is also granted greater control over the central bank and army, and the right to stand for two more consecutive terms.</p> <p>\"We're making history! Onward!\" a jubilant Correa proclaimed in his coastal hometown of Guayaquil as the scale of his victory became clear. \"This is confirmation of the citizens' revolution we're offering.\"</p> <p>Correa, 45, called it a \"clear, historic victory\" and urged Ecuadoreans to help him \"achieve a brave, sovereign and dignified homeland equitable, just and without misery\".</p> <p>The former finance minister has said the document will help to eradicate a political class that has made Ecuador one of Latin America's most corrupt countries.</p> <p>Correa has already taken a tough stance with oil companies, which he wants to accept a flat fee for extraction with no share of profits. Before a likely general election early next year, he hopes to pass a new law that will regulate mining, which he says will attract investment. </p> <p>The US-trained economist once described George Bush as \"dimwitted\" and, in reference to Ch\u00e1vez calling the US president the devil, Correa said: \"Calling Bush the devil offends the devil.\" Those comments, his policies while in office and the use of a referendum to boost his powers, including his potential time in office, have prompted unflattering comparisons with Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>But, while he counts Ch\u00e1vez as a friend, he has said Ecuador is not part of the same political movement and, unlike the Venezuelan leader, he has not moved to nationalise utilities such as telecommunications and electricity. </p> <p>And while Correa has opted not to renew a lease that allows US anti-drugs missions to fly out of a coastal airport in Manta, US diplomats have praised Ecuador's drug-fighting co-operation.</p>",

It's worse than stupidity: it's a marketing hype campaign,\" he told The Guardian.</p> <p>\"Somebody is saying this is inevitable \u2013 and whenever you hear somebody saying that, it's very likely to be a set of businesses campaigning to make it true.\"</p> <p>The 55-year-old New Yorker said that computer users should be keen to keep their information in their own hands, rather than hand it over to a third party.</p> <p>His comments echo those made last week by Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, who criticised the rash of cloud computing announcements as \"fashion-driven\" and \"complete gibberish\".</p> <p>\"The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we've redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do,\" he said. \"The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women's fashion. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It's complete gibberish. It's insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?\"</p> <p>The growing number of people storing information on internet-accessible servers rather than on their own machines, has become a core part of the rise of Web 2.0 applications. Millions of people now upload personal data such as emails, photographs and, increasingly, their work, to sites owned by companies such as Google.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.techworld.com/opsys/news/index.cfm?newsid=102279\">Computer manufacturer Dell recently even tried to trademark the term \"cloud computing\",</a> although its application was refused.</p> <p>But there has been growing concern that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/aug/06/whengoogleownsyouyourdata\">mainstream adoption of cloud computing could present a mixture of privacy and ownership issues</a>, with users potentially being locked out of their own files.</p> <p>Stallman, who is a staunch privacy advocate, advised users to stay local and stick with their own computers.</p> <p>\"One reason you should not use web applications to do your computing is that you lose control,\" he said. \"It's just as bad as using a proprietary program. Do your own computing on your own computer with your copy of a freedom-respecting program. If you use a proprietary program or somebody else's web server, you're defenceless. You're putty in the hands of whoever developed that software.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Icelandic government has seized control of one of the nation's biggest banks, Glitnir, the latest victim of the crisis gripping the world's financial markets.</p> <p>The move will stoke long-held fears that Iceland could be facing financial ruin. Officials said the government in Reykjavik had bought a 75% stake in the bank for \u20ac600m (\u00a3478m) to prevent it from going bust.</p> <p>Iceland has been under intense scrutiny in recent years. The economy has been expanded rapidly, making Icelanders among the richest people in Europe, but critics argue it has been built on too much debt, which could backfire in the current credit freeze. The country has been likened to a \"toxic hedge fund\".</p> <p>After emergency discussions with the central bank of Iceland, an offer was made last night and the bank's board agreed to the deal this morning. In a statement, Glitnir said its funding position had deteriorated in a matter of days. \"The events unfolding in international financial markets in the past two weeks have had unforseen consequences, drastically changing the conditions of Glitnir's short-term funding,\" it said.</p> <p>Despite its size, with a population of just 313,000, a financial crisis in Iceland could deliver a further blow to worldwide confidence. Cracks emerging in its economy at the beginning of the year were seen as a lead indicator of the turmoil to follow. The Icelandic krona today fell to record lows against the euro.</p> <p>Glitnir is the third largest bank in Iceland, behind Kaupthing and Landsbanki. The agreement partly answers one question that has been hovering over Iceland; whether the banks had grown too large for the Icelandic government to rescue if things went wrong.</p> <p>The government asked Glitnir's chief executive, Larus Welding, to remain in place. Welding said the bank had worked hard to secure funding over the past month but that conditions had suddenly worsened. \"We have seen similar things happen in the countries around us, which reflects the tough position that prevails in international financial markets,\" he said. \"Having the government as an owner strengthens the capital base of the bank and removes all doubt about Glitnir's financial strength.\"</p> <p>The government said the bank would continue to operate as normal and that it did not intend to hold its share \"for an extended period\".</p> <p>Iceland has been transformed in the past 20 years. After financial markets were deregulated and banks privatised in 2003, Icelandic companies that previously had only meagre access to funds were able to expand rapidly.</p> <p>In a country the size of Iceland, the only option for an ambitious company is to look overseas - the reason why so many have appeared in Britain. </p> <p>The banks have moved into foreign markets with their clients, investing alongside them and building investment bank capabilities. Landsbanki bought stockbrokers Teather &amp; Greenwood and Bridgewell in London while Kaupthing bought Singer &amp; Friedlander. The food group Bakkav\u00f6r owns Geest in Britain. The Icelandic billionaire, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Gudmundsson, the chairman of Landsbanki, backed the takeover of West Ham football club, where he is now chairman.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338091320\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>George Bush today urged Congress to swiftly push through the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\">bail-out bill</a> that would authorise the government to buy $700bn (\u00a3387bn) of \"toxic\" debt.</p> <p>The bill is an attempt to restore confidence in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/wallstreet\">beleaguered markets</a> on both sides of the Atlantic and clean up the US financial system.</p> <p>In a brief statement - aimed both at the politicians who will begin debating the measure later today and the public - the US president said support for the deal would \"send strong signals to markets both home and abroad\".</p> <p>\"A vote for this bill is a vote to prevent economic damage for you and your communities,\" he said.</p> <p>Congress is due to begin debating the 106-page bill on the controversial financial sector rescue package today, with the Senate expected to schedule a vote on Wednesday.</p> <p>The debate follows a week of intense bargaining to produce a more accountable package.</p> <p>Political reaction to the proposals has been mixed. Democrats have been more supportive of the need for a rescue plan, while Republicans were quick to reject the initial proposals. </p> <p>However, their backing for the latest package saw the bail-out bill pass its first major hurdle.</p> <p>Concerns over the legislation's passage through Congress hit stock market confidence today. </p> <p>London's FTSE 100 index dipped more than 3.5%, with banking shares particularly affected, while Wall Street was expected to suffer when trading opened.</p> <p>Bush said he was confident that the new version of the bill would be backed by Congress, and told US voters the rescue plan was the right step to take to prevent the financial crisis from spreading across the economy.</p> <p>He admitted that the bill was bold and would be a difficult vote - especially during an election year - calling it \"an extraordinary agreement to deal with extraordinary problems\".</p> <p>\"With this strong and decisive legislation, we will help restart the flow of credit so American families can meet their daily needs and American businesses can make purchases, ship goods and meet their payrolls,\" he said.</p> <p>The president argued that the checks written into the legislation would ensure US taxpayers benefited from a number of safeguards.</p> <p>He said he expected \"much, if not all\" of the $700bn cost to the taxpayer to be paid back.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he warned that, even with a bail-out, the US would still face serious challenges as the housing market crash continued to put pressure on the economy.</p> <p>\"I'm confident that, in the long run, America will overcome these challenges and remain the most dynamic and productive economy in the world,\" he said.</p> <p>Bush praised leaders \"on both sides of the aisle who came together when our nation was counting on them\" during the \"sometimes difficult\" negotiations.</p> <p>The final proposal would allow the US treasury to buy up distressed mortage-backed securities held by financial institutions. The government would later resell the assets after they had recovered much of their value.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said the treasury would post details of all transactions on the internet within 48 hours.</p> <p>In a major concession, the bill will set limits on salary packages for Wall Street executives whose companies benefit from the legislation. </p> <p>The Democrats have the votes to push the measure through Congress - but that could be politically risky in an election year.</p> <p>Public resentment at the idea of a rescue package for Wall Street is growing, but leaders are arguing that a bail-out will benefit ordinary Americans.</p>",
  "<p>We meet at a time of national anxiety.</p> <p>In the eye of a financial storm.</p> <p>Our economy suffers from a crisis of confidence.</p> <p>And our government is all crisis and no confidence.</p> <p>The Brown boom has ended in bust.</p> <p>This morning another high street bank was nationalised.</p> <p>This morning we learnt that mortgage lending has virtually stopped.</p> <p>And millions of people in our country are desperately worried about their savings, their jobs, their mortgages and paying the weekly bills.</p> <p>They look at Labour and what do they see?</p> <p>A divided party more interested in fighting themselves than fighting for the future of the country.</p> <p>And so the British people turn to us for leadership.</p> <p>They want to know the answer to two questions.</p> <p>Are you up to it?</p> <p>And will you make a difference?</p> <p>And this week we will show them.</p> <p>Yes, we are.</p> <p>And yes, we will.</p> <p>Let me talk to you today, quite calmly and quite frankly, about the grave problems our country faces.</p> <p>About how we got here and what we can do to pull ourselves out.</p> <p>I am not going to blame everything on the bankers alone.</p> <p>But nor am I going to excuse them of their responsibility, or allow them to think that things can carry on as before.</p> <p>I am not going to do what the left has done and use the crisis as an excuse to abandon the free market economy that has made our country more prosperous.</p> <p>But nor do I pretend that the crisis doesn't raise the most profound questions about our financial system and how we regulate it.</p> <p>I am not going to claim that this problem only exists in Britain or that it is all the fault of the current government.</p> <p>But nor will I let them forget who sat there in the Treasury for ten years while the regulation failed, the debt soared and no one called time on the Age of Irresponsibility.</p> <p>The Age of Irresponsibility.</p> <p>Who would have thought that the epitaph on the gravestone of the Brown years would be carved by the man himself.</p> <p>He says he's going to campaign as the candidate of experience.</p> <p>Let him try.</p> <p>He's going to find that we've all had quite enough of the Gordon Brown experience.</p> <p><strong>ECONOMIC SITUATION</strong></p> <p>The reason why our banking system is under such strain, why thousands of people fear for their jobs, and why all the talk has been of rescue deals and bail outs is this:</p> <p>In Britain, and in America too, we forgot something we should never have forgotten.</p> <p>We forgot that an economy built on debt is not an economy built to last.</p> <p>For a decade the whole world enjoyed the good times \u2013 and nowhere was the boom greater than here in Britain.</p> <p>We borrowed and borrowed as if the party would never end.</p> <p>Banks did. Businesses did. Families did. And so did this government.</p> <p>And then like any party that goes on too long, things got out of hand.</p> <p>British households borrowed more than any in Europe.</p> <p>British house prices rose faster than in America.</p> <p>Britain's budget deficit grew larger than any in the developed world.</p> <p>And instead of trying to rein in the boom, Gordon Brown led by example.</p> <p>Think you're borrowing too much?</p> <p>Don't worry, Gordon Brown said, your government is borrowing even more.</p> <p>Want to hide your bank's debts off your balance sheet?</p> <p>Don't worry, Gordon Brown said, your government has hidden billions of PFI debts where the public can't find them.</p> <p>Want to spend, spend, spend and not worry about who's going to pick up the bill?</p> <p>Go ahead, Gordon Brown said, because that is exactly what your government is doing too.</p> <p>So we racked up more than a trillion pounds of mortgages and credit card bills and households debts and the government never stopped to think what would happen if the credit dried up.</p> <p>We built an economy on the engines of finance and housing and government spending, and the government never stopped to think what would happen if those engines stalled.</p> <p>Now the credit has dried up.</p> <p>The engines of the economy have stalled.</p> <p>The party is over.</p> <p>And then, as if this was not enough, we've had to watch as apparently rock solid banks are blown over like trees in the path of a financial hurricane.</p> <p>And people suddenly realise just how fragile our debt driven economy has become.</p> <p>What we need is a wholly different approach.</p> <p>It is set out in the comprehensive plan for economic responsibility we published yesterday</p> <p>It is a plan to end Britain's dependency on debt.</p> <p>We will bring fiscal responsibility to our government.</p> <p>And we will bring financial responsibility in our economy.</p> <p>We will make sure that this mess never happens again.</p> <p><strong>CITY</strong></p> <p>But doing that means telling some hard truths.</p> <p>On Bradford and Bingley.</p> <p>We say:</p> <p>You can protect people's deposits; you can try to save jobs; you can maintain confidence; but you don't have to leave the taxpayer exposed to a multi-billion pound bill for the mistakes of the management and the big money that backed them.</p> <p>For a year the government knew there was a problem at Bradford and Bingley;</p> <p>For a year they could have put in place the solution;</p> <p>For a year they dithered and delayed.</p> <p>And once again it's the taxpayer who in the last resort is left carrying the can.</p> <p>And I want to say this to the City more generally.</p> <p>There have been terrible failures of regulation.</p> <p>And the people in charge for the last ten years must bear their full share of responsibility.</p> <p>But in the end the failures of the banking industry are the failings of the bankers.</p> <p>Perhaps there are some market ideologues who think that the money men can do no wrong.</p> <p>But I tell you this right now: I am not one of them.</p> <p>We want the City to succeed.</p> <p>We recognise the importance of the investment you bring, the prosperity you have created, the thousands of jobs that depend on you.</p> <p>As David Cameron says, we're not going to engage in knee-jerk attacks on financial services.</p> <p>We know that the industry employs people not only in hedge funds in Mayfair, but bank branches in Mansfield and call centres in Manchester.</p> <p>We admire the drive and the enterprise of so many people in the business world.</p> <p>We won't let the City of London disappear to the City of Geneva or the City of Dubai or the City of Mumbai.</p> <p>You will get the support of a Conservative government to maintain a strong and responsible banking industry that leads the world.</p> <p>But I say this too.</p> <p>If you take risks, then you must bear the cost.</p> <p>If you pay yourself sums far beyond what anyone else does in any other walk of life, then be prepared to lose it when you make mistakes.</p> <p>If you pay out big dividends when you should be rebuilding balance sheets, then you will be held to account.</p> <p>We will do what it takes to preserve the stability of the financial system and protect the deposits of ordinary savers.</p> <p>But let me warn you today:</p> <p>I will not increase taxes on the family earning \u00a320,000 to carry on paying the bonuses of the banker earning \u00a32 million pounds.</p> <p>You helped cause this mess and you can help pay to clear it up.</p> <p>The Conservative Party has always been ready to help those in need.</p> <p>But we have always said that there are no rights without responsibilities.</p> <p>No help without conditions.</p> <p>This is what we have said to the poorest people in our society.</p> <p>I am not going to say anything different to the richest.</p> <p>And for those on the left who think the Conservatives won't act, I've got a message for you.</p> <p>Unlike New Labour we are not bedazzled by big money.</p> <p>We respect wealth creation but unlike New Labour we don't fawn over it.</p> <p>It wasn't New Labour who was the first to say that the non doms should pay their fair share.</p> <p>And it wasn't Conservatives who opposed a temporary ban on short selling.</p> <p>We know what Gordon Brown is trying to do.</p> <p>He wants to blame the right for the failures of the left.</p> <p>But Gordon, you won't get away with blaming us for casino capitalism when you're the man whose been running the casino and collecting in the chips for the last eleven years.</p> <p>Let me remind you.</p> <p>It's the Conservatives who published a report on problem debt three years ago and ran a national campaign to warn people of its dangers.</p> <p>It's Conservatives who for the last year have offered bipartisan support to increase protection for savers.</p> <p>It's Conservatives who now want to give power to the Bank of England to call time on reckless borrowing.</p> <p>We Conservatives fought the last general election warning that borrowing was out of control.</p> <p>And it is we Conservatives who will fight the next election promising to bring borrowing under control.</p> <p><strong>FAMILIES</strong></p> <p>For let me tell you a second hard and uncomfortable truth.</p> <p>Government has to live within its means.</p> <p>And that means as well as financial responsibility we need fiscal responsibility.</p> <p>These are times of great economic distress for families.</p> <p>I know many many families struggling with rising bills and higher costs;</p> <p>I know there are many many families who are now worrying about their jobs and keeping up their mortgage payments.</p> <p>I give you this pledge.</p> <p>We Conservatives will do everything possible, everything in our power to help.</p> <p>We will cut your petrol taxes as oil prices rise.</p> <p>We will get you on the lowest rates for your gas and electricity.</p> <p>We will take young families facing higher mortgage costs permanently out of stamp duty.</p> <p>We will give companies facing bankruptcy a breathing space to protect your job.</p> <p>We will abandon Labour's grotesquely ill-conceived and ill-timed new tax on family cars.</p> <p>We will not leave you alone in this crisis.</p> <p>I wish we could do even more.</p> <p>A responsible government would be able to use all the money it put aside in those good years to help families now that times are tough.</p> <p>That's what many Governments are doing around the world.</p> <p>But the British Government can't.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>We know why.</p> <p>Labour failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.</p> <p>Gordon Brown will do anything to avoid telling this country the truth.</p> <p>So as he won't, I will.</p> <p>The cupboard is bare.</p> <p>There is no more money.</p> <p>Tax revenues have collapsed.</p> <p>Unemployment costs are rising.</p> <p>Borrowing is out of control.</p> <p>Labour has done it again.</p> <p>So it's no good talking about the big up-front tax giveaways we might like to make, or the big spending increases it might be nice to have.</p> <p>Because I repeat: there is no more money.</p> <p>I listen to Gordon Brown with mounting amazement.</p> <p>A billion pounds here. A billion pounds there.</p> <p>\u00a32.7 billion pounds on losing the Crewe by-election. Which is 2.7 billion pounds more than it cost us.</p> <p>All unfunded.</p> <p>All unpaid for.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is spending money like there's no tomorrow.</p> <p>Well for him there may be no tomorrow, but for us there is.</p> <p>And I believe that there is nothing more irresponsible or cynical or unfair than getting the next generation to pay the bills that you are not prepared to pay yourself.</p> <p>Our first priority will have to be bringing stability to the public finances.</p> <p>Today we announce a radically new approach that will change forever the way budgets are made in this country.</p> <p>We are going to scrap the dishonest, discredited and worthless fiscal rules.</p> <p>They have been fixed and fiddled so many times by Gordon Brown no one believes them any more.</p> <p>He went on and on about his golden rule, but it turns out the golden rule is this.</p> <p>Never trust a Labour government with the public finances.</p> <p>Instead the next Conservative Government will make this clear commitment.</p> <p>We will put the government finances on a path out of the red and into the black.</p> <p>Our goal over time will be to balance the current budget and ensure falling national debt.</p> <p>We will put sound money first.</p> <p>But I want to make sure that this won't be yet another promise made by a politician and which is then broken.</p> <p>So we will do what no government has ever done before.</p> <p>We will set up a new Office for Budget Responsibility, independent of government like the Bank of England is.</p> <p>This independent Office will stand in judgement over our commitments, hold us to our promises.</p> <p>And it will let the whole country know if we try to wriggle out of them.</p> <p>No more fiddling of the rules. No more dodgy statistics. No more hidden PFI borrowing.</p> <p>Chancellors will be forced to behave responsibly with the public finances or face the public consequences.</p> <p>And if even after what I have told you about the need to return to sound money, there are still some who think that Britain can borrow to pay for big unfunded tax cuts, let me just say this.</p> <p>I want to cut taxes too.</p> <p>I want to put money back into the pockets of families and help businesses compete.</p> <p>It is the aspiration and ambition of this Party that we leave office with taxes lower than when we came in.</p> <p>But I am not prepared to play fast and loose with the national debt in the pursuit of low taxes.</p> <p>David and I are fiscal when this Party reduces taxes, I want those reductions to last.</p> <p>Before we can cut taxes we have to stop taxes rising.</p> <p>The whole country is having to tighten its belt and save money.</p> <p>So too should their government.</p> <p>In the private sector when times are tough you take out the overheads.</p> <p>The consultants are sent packing and the advertising budget is cut.<br>Government should do the same.</p> <p>We are going to put caps on Labour's wasteful consultancy and advertising bills.</p> <p>So that we can make this announcement to you, today.</p> <p>The country may not be able to afford upfront tax cuts because borrowing is too high.</p> <p>But families facing the squeeze cannot afford tax rises either.</p> <p>We are going into partnership with local councils.</p> <p>If they find matching savings in their town hall, we will give them these savings from Whitehall.</p> <p>I can tell you today that the next Conservative Government will freeze your Council Tax for at least two years.</p> <p>Every council tax bill of every family in every council that takes part will be frozen.</p> <p>Instead of council tax bills that rise year after year under Labour, millions of families will get help at the time they need it most.</p> <p>Conservatives will not leave people to struggle with the credit crunch alone.</p> <p>We will not walk on by.</p> <p>That's not what Conservatives do.</p> <p>We will help families cope with this crisis.</p> <p>And we will help the country plan for recovery.</p> <p>Throughout this week you will hear from our team about the education reforms we will make; the welfare changes we will introduce; the parts of the country we will bring together by high speed rail.</p> <p>So that we don't just have world-class financial services but world beating manufacturing too.</p> <p>Gordon Brown had ten years to do these things but he didn't.</p> <p>He really thinks that his problem with the British people is that he's too serious and doesn't smile enough.</p> <p>He just doesn't get it.</p> <p>Being too serious isn't his problem.</p> <p>His problem is that he promised 'prudence' and then spent and borrowed his way into a record budget deficit.</p> <p>His problem is that he promised 'fairness' and then so cynically posed as a tax cutter on the backs on the poorest with the 10p tax rise,</p> <p>His problem is that he promised 'dignity in retirement' and then his first act was to raid the pots of those who had saved for their pension.</p> <p>His problem is that he told us like some old Testament Prophet that he alone had abolished the economic cycle;</p> <p>His problem is that through his hubris and his arrogance he left Britain so badly prepared when the cycle turned.</p> <p>Gordon Brown told us he had ended 'stop go'.</p> <p>No more 'boom and bust' he promised.</p> <p>Well, now the boom is over and the bust has come.</p> <p>And the message to Gordon Brown from the British people is simple. Stop. Go.</p> <p>If this country is going to get out of this economic mess, then for the first time in his career he's going to have to confront his mistakes.</p> <p>And for the first time he is going to have stop dithering.</p> <p>And for the first time he is going to have to listen to the hard working people of this country.</p> <p>Well, Mr Brown, when it comes to leading and listening and understanding:</p> <p>You know I believe in apprenticeships.</p> <p>But this is no time for a novice.</p> <p>So we offer the country change.</p> <p>Change from Labour's Age of Irresponsibility to a new Conservative Age of Responsibility.</p> <p>And that brings me to my last truth.</p> <p>It is a truth that I profoundly believe in.</p> <p>Something that motivates me in all I do in politics.</p> <p>I believe that the best years of this country lie ahead, not behind.</p> <p>I believe that our future will be better than our past.</p> <p>I have talked to you about the problems that we face because I want us to have our eyes open.</p> <p>Before us lies a tough task.</p> <p>Before us lie difficult decisions.</p> <p>We have shown the courage to face up to those in government before and we will show the same courage again.</p> <p>But I want to tell you something else.</p> <p>I want to tell you what makes our Party great.</p> <p>In this Conservative Party, we are optimists who never stop being realists.</p> <p>We are revolutionaries who never stop being pragmatic.</p> <p>We dare to dream but never run away from the day to day.</p> <p>We are idealists who never have our head in the sand.</p> <p>Be in no doubt.</p> <p>A hard road lies ahead of us.</p> <p>But that hard road leads over the horizon.</p> <p>Over the horizon will be Britain:</p> <p>- strong again<br>- prosperous again<br>- confident again<br>- proud again</p> <p>So join us on this journey.</p> <p>For we have work to do and a future to build. </p>",
  "<p>If Takashi Yamada had asked me, I'd have told him he had little chance of achieving fame and, perhaps, fortune by starting a blog devoted to cutting-edge design. Luckily, he didn't ask me. After five years, his blog has a huge following and is in 63rd place in Technorati's Top 100 list. It also has a chief executive officer and half a dozen staff, having become, it claims, \"the world's most popular and influential online design magazine\".</p> <p>The secret of <a href=\"http://www.yankodesign.com/\">Yanko Design</a>'s success is that it deals in concepts rather than products. It shows designs you can't see in the shops. Indeed, I suspect the majority will never go into production because they are of little practical use. But they often look stunning, and they make you think. </p> <p>Yanko Design uses the rubric \"Form beyond function\", but \"form over function\" is too often the result.</p> <p>The apotheosis of this sort of design was Philippe Starck's lemon squeezer, Juicy Salif. It's a tall three-legged thing that looks like a visitor from outer space. I've met someone who owns one. He says it looks great in the kitchen \u2013 it's a design classic and a conversation piece \u2013 but it's more or less useless as a lemon squeezer. You can get a better lemon squeezer in any cut-price crockery store. But designing something that just worked wouldn't have helped Starck become rich and famous.</p> <p>Yanko Design reports on designs from all sorts of fields such as architecture, cars, bathroom and other furniture, jewellery and tableware. It features lots of electronic products including watches and mobile phones. Each item is usually represented by at least one photo plus a brief text on a tasteful black background, then by readers' comments. </p> <p>Under each entry, the site also suggests up to five more items on the basis that if you liked this one, you'll like them, too. It usually gets you browsing, and something is bound to catch your eye.</p> <p>One random example is the <a href=\"http://www.yankodesign.com/2007/05/22/puzzle-table-by-hsien-chang/\">Puzzle Table by Hsien Chang</a>, which \"was inspired by sliding puzzles\". It's a worktable with storage baskets under the table top, which are exposed by moving sections of top. That's fine as long as you don't put things on top of the table, which rather defeats the purpose of having a table. At least it reminds you that sliding drawers do have a point. </p> <p>Another example is the <a href=\"http://www.yankodesign.com/2008/07/10/light-dressing-on-the-side/\">rhyme&amp;reason clothing by Mary Huang</a>: \"The dress is a combination of woven cotton jersey and hand-crocheted flowers and about two dozen bright white LEDs are embedded in each.

  "<p>The NYT did <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">a huge piece yesterday</a> on McCain, gambling and gaming interests in Washington. The substantive nut graf is this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. McCain portrays himself as a Washington maverick unswayed by special interests, referring recently to lobbyists as \"birds of prey.\" Yet in his current campaign, more than 40 fund-raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests \u2014 including tribal and Las Vegas casinos, lottery companies and online poker purveyors. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is one of those stories that's part Girl Scout and part school slut, i.e., part high-minded and part down-and-dirty. Naturally, the school slut part is far more interesting.</p> <p>The article goes into some detail about McCain's love of shooting craps. Some friends and I have been discussing: is this a bad thing? The guy does bet <em>thousands </em>of dollars, and we know that when he's betting that big he's really betting his wife's money. But I guess if she doesn't mind, the rest of us shouldn't mind (although we do not of course <em>know </em>whether she minds).</p> <p>All that said, craps is a stupid game. <a href=\"http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/08/poker_and_craps_are_not_tweedledum_and_tweedledee.php\">Here's Michael O'Hare</a> at samefacts on the difference between poker and craps:</p> <blockquote> <p>The difference between a crapshooter and a poker player is not a matter of taste in generally similar games. Poker is a game of nearly infinite subtlety and complexity, in which money is managed across a constantly changing information landscape as deep as the psychology and perspicacity of all the players. Smart poker players are much better at it than dumb ones, though smart in the usual sense is not enough to be good at it. Some people are bored with poker and can't concentrate on it well enough to succeed, but not because it's beneath their intelligence. The nearest analogy is investing in securities, or perhaps commanding small units in combat, except for the team aspect of the latter and the impersonal dimension of the former. </p> <p>Craps, like roulette and a slot machine, is a simpleminded exercise whose players pay a fee for a particular kind of reptile-brain excitement. It is not social, and no player can change the odds on the next move, which are a set of nine numbers that never change (though more complicated side bets are possible, they also depend on a fixed small set of probabilities). There is no such thing as being good at craps, and no such thing as being a steady winner. Anyone for whom it is a preferred pastime strikes me as a person scratching a psychological itch that's best understood as a character or intelligence defect. I am genuinely appalled to learn that this idiotic fidgeting absorbs McCain for any significant time.</p> </blockquote> <p>I should note that all gambling just bores me to tears (fortunately), so I have trouble differentiating, but I see O'Hare's point. Poker does require some form of patient intelligence, whereas with craps it's just a...well, I guess there's a reason they call a \"crapshoot\" a crapshoot, isn't there? If nothing else, it seems safe to say that if you love craps the way McCain does, you love adrenaline rushes based totally on chance. That's not the most reassuring character trait in the world for a nuclear-age, terrorism-age president.<br></p>",

Photograph: Eamonn McCabe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I bought this T-shirt dress from a shop in the Brunswick Centre in London. I had a very close friend who had a brain haemorrhage just before Christmas and in February he finally got better. He was at the neurological hospital in Russell Square, so after visiting him my husband and I walked up to a little shop called Joy. We were feeling really joyful, so I bought this to celebrate. The trousers I got a few years ago from a shop called Nakedly Nothing on Portobello Road. They've gone through periods when they weren't that fashionable, but they're coming back again. </p> <p><strong>And your boots? </strong></p> <p>Six years ago, I was heavily pregnant and I couldn't fit into anything. I was on my last pay cheque before becoming a mother and I thought I'd never have money to spend on myself again. These shoes were pounds 350 - I'd never spent that on anything before. I discussed it with my partner and he said, \"No bloody way.\" I bought them, claiming I got them for half price in the sales. Later he found the receipt, but I stand by my purchase because, six years later, I'm still wearing them and they're still very special. </p> <p><strong>Where is your bag from? </strong></p> <p>I got it in a charity shop on Camden High Street. It cost me pounds 3. It goes away for a while and comes back out again. It's stuffed with notes, invites for forthcoming shows, half-eaten cereal bars and general rubbish that the kids give me to put in the bin. </p> <p><strong>How would you describe your style? </strong></p> <p>It's quite eclectic. I love flea markets and I hold on to things for ever and mix them in with new things. I don't get a new wardrobe every season - it's very much mixing and matching what I've got. </p> <p><strong>You're wearing quite a few accessories. </strong></p> <p>I love accessories. This black ring I got from the V&amp;A when I went to do some research on materials that I'm using in sculptures in my forthcoming show. The gold bracelet I bought in Hebden Bridge. There is a matching necklace, but I wear one or the other. The black bracelet I got years ago from a vintage shop in Stockholm. The necklace was a present. I love it - it gives me a feeling of carnival and celebration. People see me as a bubbly, bright person and then when they see my work, which is a lot darker, they are always confused by the contradiction. </p> <p><strong>Tell me about your wedding ring. </strong></p> <p>It was originally two rings, an engagement ring and a wedding ring, but as time went on, they didn't quite fit, so I got them melted down at a jewellers. I asked him to make it look a bit like a Play-Doh ring. </p> <p><strong>What's happening with your hair? </strong></p> <p>I have lots and lots of hair, but don't always have the time to deal with it. Sometimes I wash it and I have these fantastic beautiful curls, and other times it just doesn't work, so I've learned a lot of different hair styles, a lot of plaiting and twisting over the years. This is my latest one; it's a slightly retro 80s look. </p> <p><strong>Do you always wear red lipstick?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, I do, it's my trademark. Even if I don't wear any other makeup, you often see me with red lips. </p> <p><strong>Is there anything you would never wear? </strong></p> <p>I probably wouldn't wear a whole outfit from <br>Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p><strong>Do people judge you by how you dress? </strong></p> <p>Yes. Mothers check each other out at the school gate. We're still expected to present ourselves well, look relatively sexy, and when you start looking a bit tired, certain types of people think, \"God, she's losing it a bit.\" But I dress to please my girlfriends and myself. A nice comment from my girlfriends is worth a million dollars. </p> <p><strong>Has your style changed as you've got older? </strong></p> <p>I was a bit of a hippy when I was younger. I grew up in Sweden, so my music and style influences were different from your average black kid. I remember coming over here, in the late 80s and early 90s, and I used to have my hair shaved on the sides with big bunches on top. I also used to buy stuff in charity shops and customise it, which was not the style of your average black kid. Back then, people used to think of me as \"that crazy Swedish black woman\"</p> <p>\u2022 Stolen Hours is at the Novas gallery, London NW1, October 10-30</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/\">Learning and Teaching Scotland</a>, or LTS for short, have consistently pushed the serious games agenda forward by producing quantitative positive results supporting the benefit of computer games in education. Their latest findings indicate a link between Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training and maths scores, according to the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7635404.stm\">BBC</a>. From the <a href=\"http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/news/2008/pressreleases/september/news_tcm4506488.asp\">press release</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The pupils were initially given a maths test before using Brain Training from Dr Kawashima on the Nintendo DS for 20 minutes at the start of each day for nine weeks or continuing their class as normal. The game featured challenges including reading tests, problem-solving exercises and memory puzzles designed to exercise the brain while the control group continued their lessons in a more traditional manner.</p> <p>When they were tested again at the end of the nine weeks the results found all groups involved had improved their scores but those using the game improved by a further 50% from 78 to 83 out of 100. The time taken to complete the tests also dropped by five minutes from 18.5 minutes to 13.5 minutes with the improvement of the games group more than twice as much as the control classes.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is the outcome from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/jan/11/nicolekidmansrightaboutbra\">LTS' earlier claims</a>.</p> <p>For more on serious games, check this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/audio/2008/sep/17/tech.weekly.podcast\">Tech Weekly programme</a>, where David Wortley, director of the <a href=\"http://www.seriousgames.org.uk/\">Serious Games Institute</a> explains why evidence that games teach good doesn't mean evidence that they also teach bad.</p> <p><em>Cheers <a href=\"http://www.silversprite.com/\">Silversprite</a>!</em></p>",

  "<p>It's not like I hadn't been warned that Copenhagen would be pricey. The city regularly features in surveys of the <a href=\"http://www.mercer.com/costofliving\">world's most expensive destinations</a>, and for weeks before, every time I mentioned where I was going, someone would laugh gently, before relating some extraordinary tale about a \u00a36 pint. </p> <p>I'd also had to book a hotel of course, a process that involved much fraught clicking between <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com\">TripAdvisor</a>, hotel websites, and this <a href=\"http://www.xe.com/ucc/\">currency converter</a>, trying to stretch the budget to cover anything other than the unappealingly named <a href=\"http://www.cabinn.com/english/kbh/city/city.html\">Cabinn City budget hotel</a>, around \u00a360-a-night for the room only; or the private rooms at \"designer\" youth hostel, <a href=\"http://www.danhostel.dk/content/us/hostel_details?HostelId=144\">Copenhagen City</a>, rooms \u00a380+. In the end, I said, \"sod it\", whispered a short prayer to the goddess Visa, and booked the nice but hardly mind-blowing <a href=\"http://www.avenuehotel.dk/index.php?id=1\">Avenue</a> for the-relative-bargain-price-of-\u00a3120-a-night. What can I say? I'm a holiday-maker, not a traveller. There's no pleasure to be had in roughing it. </p> <p>Even after all that, however, nothing can fully prepare you for Denmark proper. Vaguely you know alcohol is going to be expensive (don't they heavily tax it in Scandinavian countries to stop everyone from drifting into suicidal alcoholism during the winter?), but it's not until you've handed over <a href=\"http://www.sebastopol.dk\">\u00a313 for two pints</a> that you start to appreciate what everyone was warning you about. I kept smiling at the bar, staggered to a table outside, and collapsed like a man who'd just been hit by a big truck heavily loaded with \"reality\". Good as the beers brewed at Carlsberg's Jacobsen microbrewery are, it's very difficult to enjoy your first pint when you know you can't afford a second.</p> <p>Or anything else for that matter. Because, as it soon became clear, everything in Copenhagen (except cigarettes) is expensive. Cornetto? \u00a32.50. Small bottle of mineral water? \u00a32. Croissant and coffee? \u00a36. At dinner, you're talking at least \u00a325 for a good, but not exceptional, main meal and a glass of wine, and you can easily spend a lot more. The Metro is ultra-efficient, but it costs over \u00a32 to go a couple of stops, while a return ticket to go across the \u00d6resund Bridge to Malm\u00f6, a journey that takes just 30 minutes, is over \u00a317. So much for the myth of competitively priced European public transport. </p> <p>However, if you're only in Copenhagen for a few days - who could afford more? - all is not lost. If you're happy to simply wander around, and get a feel for the city, which I am, then you can laze around in Copenhagen's many beautiful parks, or gawp at iconic waterfront architecture, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Larsen\"> Henning Larsen</a>'s Opera House, for free. Similarly, it won't cost you a penny to have a look, if you must, at the Little Mermaid; tour the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.frihedsmuseet.dk/sw23424.asp\">Museum of Danish Resistance</a>; or visit that one-time hippy Shangri-la, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania\"> Christiana</a>. The latter is a pale, distinctly moody shadow of its former self; one ringed with police without, and full of very serious looking drug dealers within. It's kind of like <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=R8PGWJ6LuOo\"> The Wire's Hamsterdam</a>, only with Bob Marley beach towels and vegan falafel stalls.</p> <p>If you've the tenacity to get off the tourist trail you can even eat and drink, I wouldn't say cheaply, but at London prices. Luckily, I was staying on the edge of lively, grungy N\u00f6rrebro. It's a student/creative enclave with a large immigrant population and, consequently, it's relatively cheap. Keke's Kokken takeaway (Rantzausgade 10) - excellent meatballs, brilliant zingy fresh salads, eat your fill for about \u00a36 - was a lifesaver. Meanwhile, the beers at nearby indie-arty bar, <a href=\"http://www.tjili.dk\">Tjili Pop</a>, start at around \u00a33.</p> <p>Even in town, seek and ye shall find a pint for under \u00a34. The hunt led me to <a href=\"http://studenterhuset.com\">Copenhagen's student union bar</a>, which is fine as long as you don't mind that night's band endlessly sound-checking in the background. Meanwhile, at the friendly, no frills <a href=\"http://www.ivebeenthere.co.uk/tips/10190\">Moose bar</a>, during happy hour, you can get two pints for less than a fiver. Obviously, it was packed. </p> <p>The point is, no matter where you are, no matter how expensive your destination, there are always coping strategies. There are always cheaper bolt-holes to get drunk in; there is always good free cultural stuff to do. If you know where to find it, that is.</p> <p>So, in the spirit of sharing, we want your tips. Where can we find a comfortable bed and a good, cheap meal in Moscow? Can it really be true, as a colleague insists, that you can pretty much camp for free anywhere in Norway? What do Tokyo's financially-challenged shop workers and students do for entertainment and culture? Does Reykjavik have to be ruinous? Can you visit Zurich without bankrupting yourself? Where does the innocent tourist find a bona fide bargain in London?</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's sequin-encrusted jewel in its light entertainment crown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/sep/20/heidi.stephens.strictly.come.dancing\">returned last Saturday</a>. Not to be outdone, the USA's answer, Dancing with the Stars, <a href=\"http://uktv.co.uk/gold/homepage/sid/6372\">is back this week on UKTV Gold</a>. Like all successful reality formats, Strictly Come Dancing has been exported all over the world, but does its American counterpart come up to snuff?</p> <p><strong>1) Hosts. </strong>A male of senior years and an attractive younger lady? Check. Where we have the erratic and embarrassing but still endearing Bruce Forsyth, accompanied by the solicitous Tess Daly and her ever-increasing wardrobe of ugly dresses, DwtS has Tom Bergeron, who once hosted Hollywood Squares (like Celebrity Squares, but in Hollywood), and E! reporter Samantha Harris, who has a tendency to shout into the microphone like she's on a red carpet somewhere.</p> <p><strong>Victor:</strong> Strictly Come Dancing</p> <p><strong>2) Judges. </strong>Strictly's head judge Len Goodman appears on DwtS and has transported his own special brand of nonsensical scoring and fondness for macho sportsmen and their incredible dancing journeys over the Atlantic. Bruno Tonioli joins him on the judging panel, all mixed metaphors and flirtatious banter. Sadly, on DwtS, Len and Bruno's relentless positivity isn't kept in check by the pragmatic Arlene Phillips or Craig Revel-Horwood. They're alongside Carrie-Ann Inaba, choreographer and actress, who may be nice, but three judges being nice does not make good television.</p> <p><strong>Victor:</strong> Strictly Come Dancing<br><strong><br>3) Celebrities of dubious fame. </strong>Well, perhaps my assessment of someone's celebrity on DwtS is harsh, but I can say that I've heard of five of this season's stars, and would recognise maybe two of them if they walked past me in the street. Having said that, there are two of Strictly's celebrities that I didn't recognise either, so perhaps this is a moot point. </p> <p><strong>Victor:</strong> A tie<br><strong><br>4) Professional dancers with complicated family ties. </strong>Dancing is an incestuous business, apparently. On Strictly, we've had the happily married Darren Bennett and Lilia Kopylova and James and Ola Jordan, the once-engaged Camilla Dallerup and Brendan Cole and the divorced Matthew and Nicole Cutler. That's straightforward enough. On DwtS, we've got a married couple, a brother and sister and now even a father and son. It's reassuring that the producers on both series like to encourage inter-family wars by bringing in celebrity couples to compete \u2013 Gabby and Kenny Logan faced off against each other in Strictly and Harry Hamlin and Lisa Rinna have done the same on DwtS.</p> <p><strong>Victor:</strong> Dancing with the Stars<br><strong><br>5) Highlight of the viewing year.</strong> DwtS? Not so much. Like so many popular American series, it suffers from overkill with two series every year. Strictly, on the other hand, benefits from the anticipation and its pre-Christmas climax.</p> <p><strong>Victor:</strong> Strictly Come Dancing</p> <p>Not to disparage DwtS, Strictly Come Dancing is the original and the best. May its glitterball never fade.</p>",
  "<p>Now here's an interesting prediction from a breakfast fringe meeting at the Tory conference today. John McCain will beat Barack Obama on November 4, but serve only one term. In consequence the next presidential contest in the United States will be fought between Vice-President Sarah Palin and Senator Hilary Clinton.</p> <p>No, I don't believe it either. Too much is now changing too fast in our world for any safe prediction \u2013 this one came from Francis Maude MP \u2013 to be made about how things will be in 2012. </p> <p>When \"Nuclear Jack\" Welch, the tough old boot who masterminded General Electric (GE) for years decides \u2013 as he did the other day \u2013 that this is the Big One, we had all better fasten our seatbelts.</p> <p>Put it another way, my old Guardian colleague, <a href=\"http://www.simonwinchester.com/\">Simon Winchester</a>, now a highly-successful, US-based author \u2013 Krakatowa, The Doctor of Crowthorne etc - likes to tell the story of how he lectured in New York on the coming perils of global warning, explaining how rising levels of the world's oceans may drown us all. </p> <p>\"Well, not New York of course,\" someone in the audience observed. Yes, New York too. Not quite the flood Winchester predicted, but it may now be happening.</p> <p>Back to Birmingham, the presidency and the Tory conference. There's a building they've dubbed \"the freedom zone\" behind the main conference hall. It's where the libertarian right is parading its views, possibly unaware that our fast-changing world is making many such views a bit of a luxury.</p> <p>This morning a group called the \"DC Tories\" \u2013 ie Brits who live in Washington \u2013 got a couple of senior American backroom types to debate the relative merits of Senators McCain and Obama, with Ed Cox (Richard Nixon's son-in-law) for the Republicans, and Bill Barnard (an ex-professor at Oxford) for the Democrats.</p> <p>In truth, both were rather safe and dull. The two Tory MPs who had attended the two conventions, Brooks Newmark for McCain and Francis Maude at what he admitted was the \"brilliant\" Obama launch in Denver, were both much livelier. US politics tends to the earnest these days: it has done them little good lately.</p> <p>Anyway Cox argued that on the key issues - freedom, opportunity, accountability, limited government and a strong defence \u2013 his man has a long and solid track record while Obama does not. </p> <p>The world is a far more dangerous place than it was in the early 90s, he added. Putin, not Yeltsin, Hizbullah and Hamas, not the Oslo Accords, a near-nuclear Iran, Danny Ortega back in power in Nicaragua, another ally for that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>Oh yes, and China on the rise. Not yet a world power, but an economic power in east Asia (they still don't get it, these guys do they?), it is in a position to tail the US Seventh Fleet, which protects Taiwan. If the Chinese CP senses its power ebbing it will play the nationalist card against Taiwan, he said.</p> <p>Good point, though he didn't say what he thinks the US will be able to do about it. </p> <p>McCain understands this stuff and made a brave stand in favour of the US military \"surge\" which has stablised Iraq \u2013 even George Bush was initially against it. He didn't mention him by name, Bush's name barely featured at all.</p> <p>Bill Barnard should have made short work of all that, but he was a bit flat. He agreed about priorities, but said the Democrats had a better record on all of them. Didn't mention Obama too much either, now I reflect on it. </p> <p>McCain's record deserved respect, but wasn't any where near as good as claimed. He seems obsessed with process, not with substance. On the two issues where he's broken with his party on substance \u2013 the amnesty for illegal immigrants and carbon emissions \u2013 he has been forced to backtrack.</p> <p>Since Cox had made much of McCain's judgment, Barnard retaliated by saying that a man of 72 with skin cancer problems who picked Sarah Palin as his running mate when he barely knew her was not a man whose judgment voters should trust.</p> <p>Alaska looks big, but it has just 700,000 citizens \u2013 \"less than Birmingham\", he pointed out. As for Obama's tax-and-spend instincts, his tax cut for 95% of taxpayers could be funded simply by reversing the Bush tax cuts for the very rich \u2013 so great had those cuts been.</p> <p>As I suggested earlier, those sort of exchanges are way out of whack with reality as it is emerging on Wall St, Main St and New St Birmingham, which has five building society offices in a row. Brooks Newmark, MP for Braintree and himself a City figure, weighed in behind McCain and said: \"I love Sarah Palin.\" </p> <p>Why? Because she is a change candidate, a small town mayor who took on her party's establishment and became governor. All right, she's a Christian fundamentalist who kept her own Down's baby and made her pregnant 17-year-old daughter marry the boy and keep their baby. Easy to mock in Europe, but up to 150 million Americans think the same way. That is true \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 and it is a sobering thought.</p> <p>Francis Maude called Obama \"a formidable performance artist\" whose Denver acceptance speech he would long remember. Studiously neutral as to his own preference (many Tories favour Obama) he agreed that the next president should engage better with the world - and that either will do that. Unusually, both are change candidates, both outsiders.</p> <p>Two interesting details I'd not heard before. </p> <p>One: Barnard said that McCain wanted Senator Joe Lieberman, the ex-Dem independent from Connecticut who ran with Al Gore in 2000, to be his running-mate.

So did Condi Rice. After her experience with Yeltsin's Russia they both thought that, if you got rid of the bad guys, democracy would take root easily. </p> <p>\"You Brits, with your experience of the world, know better.\" The audience liked that, of course.

  "<p>It's a project which has already been beset by problems, not least a major shooting delay due to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/28/1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=film\">Sherwood Forest appearing insufficiently green</a>. But Ridley Scott is at least unlikely to have too much of a problem scheduling a date when his key players for Robin Hood tale Nottingham are free to begin work - the director has reportedly cast <a href=\"http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/09/27/breaking-russell-crowe-will-play-robin-hood-and-the-sheriff-in-ridley-scotts-nottingham/\">Russell Crowe as both Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham</a>.</p> <p>Scott revealed the bold move in an interview with MTV News to promote his new film Body of Lies, which also stars Crowe. \"He's playing both!\" he said. The Blade Runner director also said there would be \"a good old clever adjustment of characters\" in Nottingham. \"One becomes the other. It changes,\" he said. </p> <p>If the casting decision is bona fide, and not some sort of mischievous jape on the British director's part, it suggests that Scott's take on the Robin Hood myth is going to be even more revisionist than previously thought. The original reported plan was for Crowe to play a \"nice-guy\" Sheriff of Nottingham, with the Robin Hood character shifting into villain territory. Christian Bale had been tipped to play the leader of the (presumably not-so) Merry Men. Sienna Miller had reportedly signed on to play Maid Marian.</p> <p>As mentioned above, the shoot was originally due to take place in mid-August, but was delayed until at least spring due to concerns over the threatened actor's strike, and fears that the leaves in the location doubling for Sherwood Forest would not be green enough.</p>",
  "<p>I pretend my blog is a houseplant. It's like a spider plant - when I go in to do stuff, it's like watering it. Sometimes, vines go brown and I don't want them to mess up the rest of it, so I have to weed it a little. You know how spider plants get where the ends dry up so you have to snap them off? </p> <p>So <a href=\"http://cave.cardinology.com/\">Foggy</a> is like a houseplant that can think. And sometimes, if it's really wound up, it has something to say. One of the things I like to do is to write responses to people that blog about me. But to make it more like a conversation, I'll only put it up for a short period. Sometimes I'll time it, like \"I'm going to say something and I'm going to let it live there for thirty minutes and then it's going to be gone forever\", so people will see it and then maybe they'll choose to think about it later.</p> <p>The blog also serves a more practical purpose. Unless you go on the road to party and make out with a bunch of girls that you don't know - which is not me, it's not who I am - then it's good to have something to do, it's good to have someone, it's good to have a friend. Not like an imaginary friend, but someone there - that's kind of what the blog is.</p> <p>I started it just as an outlet, to have a connection, because I don't keep that many friends - at times I'm a little bit of a loner. It's not that I'm anti-social, it's just hard to explain my life, even to myself, sometimes. I've lived an interesting, strange little life already, so I guess the blog kind-of levels it out. Also, I like the idea that people can maybe see some of the process, or they can check in and see really stupid things I've come up with that day. </p> <p>I stopped the blog for a while earlier this year because I entertained doubt and doubt is the enemy of art. But once I got my shit together I went back to it and I thought \"No, I will keep sharing, this is ridiculous, why should I stop?\" </p> <p>It isn't because it's addictive or I feel like being an exhibitionist, that's not really the point. There's two ways to approach being a musician - either make yourself tiny and say \"look, I'm knucklehead and if I can do this anyone can\" or say \"look at me I am making this stuff and I am fucking better than you\". </p> <p>I think most artists aren't really artists, because they feel like they're better than someone who works in an office and has a life that maybe seems dull. Because to an artist, these people have the most fantastic life in the whole world. If you become someone who travels the entire world as a storyteller or musician, it's probably because you are so excited by the world but, at the same time, feel disconnected with it, and need to express that.</p> <p>I think most artists feel like they're <em>less</em> than a regular person. That's probably the case with me, and explains tons of my behaviour. So, sure, if more people are drawn to the blog because I play guitar in a band and write some songs and stuff, then that's fine. But I think that elementally, what you find there is that I'm just as bored and confused as everyone else, and sometimes just as wound up about something.<br><em><br>Ryan Adams was talking to Emma Edmondson</em></p>",
  "<p>Charles de Gaulle once described the Dutch lowlands as an aberration of history - a region that should have been swallowed up by either France or Germany but for some inexplicable reason wasn't. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax\">Ajax</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/feyenoord\">Feyenoord</a> say that their inability to compete internationally is an aberration of the market - that the TV revenue generated by the Eredivisie is too low to allow them to operate properly. The former statement has far more credence than the latter.</p> <p>Yes, a single <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> club can earn as much from television rights as the entire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/eredivisie\">Eredivisie</a> combined, but that's not the reason Ajax and Feyenoord have disappeared from football's elite. Over the past couple of decades <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/psveindhoven\">PSV Eindhoven</a> have developed a business plan that has allowed them to compete both domestically and internationally. How? By spending smarter, not more. They have signed players primarily from under-scouted regions thus keeping transfer fees low. This low risk, high return approach has netted PSV many millions in transfer profits.</p> <p>Other Dutch clubs have copied this approach and have similarly enjoyed great success, reducing the gap between the Big Three and all the rest. In the past 15 years Heervenveen signed Jon Dahl Tomasson, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Georgios Samaras, Afonso Alves and Miralem Sulejmani for a combined \u20ac6.61m (\u00a35.25m approx) and sold them for \u20ac61.1m (\u00a348.5m approx). A great fortune can be made by buying obscure players or recycling bigger clubs' cast-offs.</p> <p>The only two clubs not adopting this strategy are Ajax and Feyenoord - and it shows. The two crippled themselves with a never-ending series of imprudent and pricey transfers and find themselves having to spend even more just to stay afloat. Feyenoord's cash has already run out and they have sunk to <a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=14\">13th place</a> in the Eredivisie. If Ajax don't return to winning ways - and the Champions League next year - they could soon follow.</p> <p>On Sunday Ajax eventually broke through a sturdy Vitesse defence to win 3-0, thanks largely to an especially impressive performance from the 21-year-old defensive midfielder Eyong Enoh, who is hailed as the reincarnation of Claude Makelele. \"Every time [his opponent] wanted to receive the ball \u2026 he found his guard Enoh in the way,\" wrote Geert Langendorff in the Dutch newspaper Trouw.</p> <p>The Ajax striker Luis Su\u00e1rez was less worthy of applause. Although he scored another marvellous goal, the talented Uruguayan also has a flair for fainting in the penalty area and his reputation is now so bad that he was denied an actual penalty against Feyenoord last Saturday. Against Vitesse he decided to grab an opponent's leg after having gone to ground and then pretended to have been hit in the face when the leg attempted to jerk itself free. He was lucky to escape with a yellow card.</p> <p>That wasn't quite the dumbest moment of the weekend, however. That accolade went to NEC's Jo\u00ebl Tshibamba, who took off his shirt after opening the scoring against Heracles Almelo on Sunday and earned his second yellow card of the match. It was the second time this season that a NEC player had been sent off for taking off his shirt after Rutger Worm did exactly the same thing in week one. This time, an understaffed NEC went on to concede the equaliser in the 89th minute. \"This is ridiculous,\" said the NEC manager Mario Been. \"Think and keep your shirt on.\"</p> <p>On Saturday, PSV created chance after chance against Volendam and their portly goalkeeper Jeroen Verhoeven, a man who looks more like a professional darts player than a footballer. But Verhoeven held up remarkably well and kept a clean sheet for 73 minutes until PSV finally broke through and <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=VrT3E2RCvcA\">Stijn Wuytens scored the only goal of the match</a>. \"When you dominate the way we did you have to score goals,\" said the PSV manager Huub Stevens.</p> <p>\"Groningen have a better team than Feyenoord,\" warned the pundit Johan Derksen before the two teams met \u2013 and so it proved. The Feyenoord defender Kevin Hofland was sent off after 10 minutes, although Groningen's Goran Lovre had been spared that same fate minutes earlier after a dangerous tackle. Feyenoord were reduced to damage-control and did well to escape with a 3-1 defeat, grateful to the tireless midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, who could well be the next Clarence Seedorf.</p> <p>Groningen's opening goal came direct from a free kick and some cunning play from Sepp de Roover, who waited for the Feyenoord wall to jump in unison before sliding the ball into the bottom corner. \"We'd all agreed that we'd jump,\" said Roy Makaay. \"It's pretty obvious that we won't be jumping anymore.\"</p> <p>NAC Breda, who are masters at getting the best out of otherwise unwanted footballers, <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=p-TMhd_Jtiw\">pummelled a previously impressive Heerenveen 4-2</a> in one of those matches that makes Dutch football so exciting. The Ajax reject Martijn Reuser scored the opening goal, the Feyenoord-outcast Anthony Lurling the second, and the Dortmund outcast Matthew Amoah the third and fourth. Amoah now heads the scoring chart with six goals.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal's resurgent <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=1prnijPP5s0\">AZ Alkmaar coasted to a 5-2 win</a> against Willem II, with Mounir El Hamdaoui scoring a hat-trick against his former club, despite being booed by the crowd. But despite El Hamdaoui's triumphant return to Tilburg, the night belonged to the AZ striker Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=aoLg-Uzio8o\">who dribbled past seven men to score a wonderful goal</a> and reaffirm his status as world-class striker in training. \"He didn't quite walk on water, but it was pretty close,\" the commentator cooed. \"It was just a good goal,\" said a modest Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. \"I don't think it was luck.\"</p> <p>Steve McClaren's second straight win with FC Twente wasn't quite so pretty. They beat the lowly De Graafschap 3-0 in what was an unwatchable match, like most of Twente's recent outings. But the side are looking increasingly solid and a return of eight points from four matches, good for fourth place, is impressive.</p> <p><strong>Results</strong> PSV 1-0 FC Volendam, NAC 4-2 Heerenveen, Willem II 2-5 AZ, FC Twente 3-0 De Graafschap, FC Groningen 3-1 Feyenoord, Ajax 3-0 Vitesse, NEC 1-1 Heracles, ADO Den Haag 0-0 FC Utrecht, Sparta 2-2 Roda JC.</p>",

  "<p>In modern Britain, who do we think we are? Or, more precisely, to whom do we give our allegiance \u2013 Allah, the Pope, our parents' country of origin, Britain, Scotland, Arsenal, feminism, the Territorial Army, the pull of Prada?</p> <p>We apparently embrace the idea of community, but what creates a sense of social cohesion and can immigration fracture it? Does anyone define themselves according to their class any more? Do the newly arrived have to behave more British than the British or can they retain many of their own customs and values and still expect a welcome? Is there really a crisis in British identity?</p> <p>These are tricky questions to pose \u2013 and the answers are even harder to extricate from the myths and propaganda and media hype around immigration and the pessimistic public narrative that currently prevails in some quarters. One that says everyone is out for themselves, the individual rules in isolated splendour. While \"they\", the foreigners, are rapidly taking over, changing what it means to be British. </p> <p>Mistrust is now the setting for all discussions around identity, immigration, allegiance and social cohesion. Government constantly told us that immigration was under control; numbers have subsequently proved otherwise. The plight of sections of the white working class and the lack of progress in health, education and employment fuels division and discontent.</p> <p>Given the level of suspicion, the findings of <a href=\"www.identities.org.uk\">Identities and Social Action</a>, a five-year \u00a34m research programme, funded by the <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/index.aspx\">Economic and Social Research Council</a> might be easily dismissed; washed away by prejudice. And that would be a pity. </p> <p>A precis of the programme's research gleaned from 25 projects, conducted by universities in the UK and abroad, was given at a one day conference in London this week. Some of the studies were predictable, as was the justifiable charge that the material was filtered through the lenses of predominantly white middle class researchers, which is difficult to avoid given who goes to university. This criticism was made by panel member <a href=\"http://www.shaunbailey.co.uk/\">Shaun Bailey</a>, who personifies how multiple identities are increasingly the norm. In his case: black; second-generation British; originally from Jamaica; Muslim; and the Tory candidate for Hammersmith. </p> <p>What the findings of Identities and Social Action flag up strongly, if unsurprisingly, is that if the government really wants to encourage social cohesion then immigration has to be controlled more fairly and efficiently. It also has to invest support in both white deprived communities and the migrants who are already here. (One study, for instance, of Somali young people in Sheffield underlines how the lack of adequate help in education pushes them towards either Muslim support systems and religious schools or towards offending.) The government also has to adopt some unpopular policies. It could begin by banning all single faith schools.</p> <p>Integration is a huge challenge in the 21st century. People have a right to develop their own sense of identity \u2013 but what if that conflicts with some of the values of the host community? The position of women in some immigrant societies inevitably comes to mind, an issue covered in the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4828349.ece\">The Times on Friday.</a> </p> <p>A report to be published next month by the <a href=\"http://www.islamicpluralism.org/\">Centre for Islamic Pluralism</a> alleges that some imams \"turn a blind eye\" to beatings, rape and abuse of women. On the other hand, an immigrant rooted in a family with a different culture and habits and aspirations from the host community may also pay a personal price when endeavouring to mix in with whites. </p> <p>In one longitudinal study of immigrant children, conducted as part of the Identities programme, 400 Asian and white children were followed in 20 primary schools for 12 months and their levels of well being, self-esteem and social acceptance recorded. On average, the school populations were 40% Asian and 60% white. (Unfortunately, no research was carried out in schools or neighbourhoods where the host population are the minority.)</p> <p>What the study discovered is that the more diverse the school, the greater the sense of well being, self-esteem and mutual friendship and the fewer the peer problems and hostility among both Asian and white children. It's not astrophysics: the more positive contact people from different communities have with each other, the greater the understanding, tolerance and possibilities for mutual benefit \u2013 as the threat of \"difference\" is diminished. The study also found that the Asian children were slightly more emotionally fragile perhaps because of the effort of straddling two cultures and experiencing discrimination as they tried to fit in.</p> <p>If contact works and single faith schools operate against that message, reducing opportunities for friendships and accentuating difference why not, in the name of the greater good, insist that all state education must be secular? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.progressive-governance.net/uploadedFiles/Publications/Publications/Immigration%20and%20Integration%20final.pdf\">In Rethinking Immigration and Integration: A New Centre Left Agenda</a>, Dr Alessandra Buonfino points out that much of the challenge of immigration and integration lies in how government and communities handle and shape multiple loyalties; assimilation isn't the solution.</p> <p>Some of the identities and Social Action findings support her view. For instance, one study established that while there is a long-term decline in the proportion of people who think of themselves as British, no \"crisis of British identity\" could be found. Almost everyone expressed a dual identity (British and Welsh say or Muslim and British). The group with the greatest lack of attachment is not those who follow Islam but young black Caribbeans born in Britain. (All young people feel less sense of belonging than older generations). </p> <p>Research in the Identities programme also established that while we identify ourselves by class when pushed (still influenced by father's occupation), we no longer have a sense of class allegiance that, for example, dictates our choice of political party, a change that accelerated under New Labour. As a result, we are less inclined to turn out at election time; we have become a nation of floating voters, shopping for the best deal.</p> <p>However, individualism doesn't entirely rule. New collective identities are being forged among smaller groups, for instance, environmental and anti-war movements, graduates, feminists and young people, with around 60% in each group feeling \"commonality\" with fellow members. More optimistically, the Identities and Social Action research also says that the emergence of these newer collective social groupings may have implications for protest politics and alternative forms of political participation, perhaps heralding the rise of the \"critical citizen\". Critical citizens whom, presumably, are highly diverse in terms of colour, creed, faith, class, origins and football allegiance \u2013 but who share values and at least one common goal. </p> <p>Paradoxically, most white people in the UK have little contact with minorities while, according to Identities and Social Action, we suffer from an \"information deficit\". Very few of us really know who is coming into the UK, who is leaving and who is getting what in terms of jobs, support and benefits. In the absence of knowledge, we imagine the worst.</p> <p>Sadly it is from this potentially poison well that politicians prefer to draw especially when their own careers look shaky or an election approaches. Why draw on the results of a lengthy and expensive research project that examines the identities, allegiences and sense of social cohesion among the UK's existing and would-be citizens when the exploitation of fear can bring so much richer electoral rewards? </p>",
  "<p>Ex-service personnel could get free teacher training under a Conservative government, the shadow schools secretary will announce tomorrow.</p> <p>Michael Gove will tell the Tory party conference that encouraging former armed forces personnel to become teachers could improve classroom discipline and provide positive role models for children. </p> <p>The Conservatives also plan to boost the funding of an independent charity, Expanding Skill Force, which recruits ex-servicemen and women to become \"skills instructors\" to vulnerable children and disengaged teenagers.</p> <p>The idea of encouraging ex-service personnel into teaching is based on a similar scheme in the US, called Troops to Teachers.</p> <p>Since World War II returning American soldiers have also been given the opportunity to attend college.</p> <p>The Conservatives say seven in 10 of those who leave the armed forces at sergeant level or above want to go into a training role.</p> <p>Yet currently, just 68 ex-service personnel a year enter teacher training.</p> <p>Gove, due to outline the plans in a speech to conference delegates in Birmingham tomorrow, will say a Tory government would fund 1,000 ex-service personnel to become Skill Force instructors \u2013 a fivefold increase.</p> <p>It would offer bursaries of \u00a39,000 to 200 ex-service personnel who take post-graduate teacher training. </p> <p>And in a commitment to ex-service personnel, a Tory government would introduce a \"GI\" bill which would pay the tuition fees of those seeking to do a first degree after active service. </p> <p>Gove expressed support for a similar policy recommendation from the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank earlier this year</p> <p>In his conference speech, the shadow schools secretary will say: \"In 1945 the American government honoured the men and women who'd fought against fascism - the greatest generation - with a piece of legislation, the GI bill, which granted returning heroes the right to free university education.</p> <p>\"The young men and women serving in Afghanistan and Iraq are heroes of our time; their sacrifices in the cause of freedom make them the greatest of our generation, and they deserve the thanks of all of us.</p> <p>\"That is why a Conservative government will honour their service by guaranteeing them the right to free university education.\"</p>",

  "<p>Almost undetected, Russia is regaining much of the influence that it lost in the Middle East after the Soviet Union collapsed. Ever since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Russia invaded Georgia</a> in August, Arab satellite television and websites have been rife with talk about the region's role in an emerging \"new cold war\". Is the Arab world's cold war patron really back, and, if so, what will it mean for peace in the region? </p> <p>With the USSR's demise, communist ideology, which Muslims believe contradicts their faith, ended too. Communism never stopped Arab regimes opposed by the United States from accepting arms supplies from the Soviet-era Russians, but it did prevent Russia from securing the kind of intimate influence that America had secured with its regional allies. Now, even Islamists are welcoming Russia back as a regional player in order to strengthen their struggle against American hegemony, conveniently forgetting Russia's brutal suppression of Chechen Muslims during the 1990s. </p> <p>This is a complete reversal of the pattern that prevailed in the 1950s. Back then, the US encouraged Islam as a bulwark against communism. Its allies in the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, justified US influence on the grounds that Americans were Christian and thus part of the Ahl el-Kitab (the people of the Book). The Soviets were regularly attacked as dangerous enemies of God. </p> <p>Today, US power in the Middle East is at its historical nadir, and Russia is seeking to fill the vacuum. Even America's closest allies \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel \u2013 are vulnerable as they face the aggressive expansion of \"radical forces\" represented by Iran, Hamas, Hizbullah, Syria, and the Iraqi resistance. In the prevailing atmosphere of turmoil and confusion, the radical Islamists attack the Americans as barbarous crusaders who have replaced the communists as the enemies of Islam. Indeed, for the conservative majority in the region, the US, with is pop culture and liberal democracy, is seen as a far more problematic ally than the autocratic and wealth-loving Russians. </p> <p>Russia's inroads in the region began with former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/16/russia.iran\">President Vladimir Putin's state visit to Iran</a> in October 2007 \u2013 the first visit by a Russian leader since Stalin's trip to Tehran in 1943. Russia, of course, helped Iran kick off its nuclear program, and has often defended the Iranian regime from stiffer United Nations sanctions. </p> <p>Russia views its relations with Iran as a means to leverage its diplomatic influence in the wider Middle East, where the US has sought (successfully) to marginalise the Kremlin since the cold war's end. Russia's other aim has been to exempt from UN sanctions the Bushehr nuclear reactor that it has been building for Iran. A full UN-sponsored financial squeeze on Iran would jeopardize Russia's profits from providing nuclear fuel for the reactor, which is due to be commissioned soon. </p> <p>Indeed, for the first time in Russia's history in the Middle East, it can depend on genuinely powerful local allies. The Soviet Union lost Egypt in 1972, and its naval bases in Syria were abandoned in 1989. Now, Russia has signed strategic agreements with Iran and is reconstructing military bases in Syria in response to an appeal by President Bashar Al-Assad (who visited Moscow in a brazen bid for Kremlin support just after the Georgian war ended). Iran's regime is eager to publicise its partnerships with Russia, and to make concessions to it in order to face the American and Israeli threat and to gain more time to pursue its nuclear program. Hamas, too, is proud of its Russian connections, so much so that it was one of only three regimes in the world to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the regions that Russia has helped break away from Georgia. </p> <p>In response to America's failed policies in the Middle East, whether in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon or Palestine, Russia appears to be using its oil-fired wealth to knit together a new bloc to counter the US presence. Even in Iraq, Russia is making headway. It has written off some $12bn in debt dating from Saddam and is pushing to create an Iraq-Syria oil pipeline, which will further its bid to control much of the transport of oil and gas. Russia is also ready and willing to provide more developed weapons to Syria and Iran. </p> <p>In the short term Russia, armed with high oil prices, has nothing to lose \u2013 but in the long term, Russia's policy in the Middle East appears to be doubly misguided. A nuclear-armed Iran on its doorstep is certainly not in Russia's national interest, particularly given the increasing radicalisation of Russia's own 20 million Muslim citizens \u2013 the only part of its population that is actually growing. Indeed, Iran was a keen backer of the Chechen separatists that Russia spent almost a decade fighting to put down. </p> <p>With Muslims becoming a bigger factor in Russian domestic politics in the decades ahead, it may be wise for Russia to take an interest in Middle East affairs. But strengthening the hands of the region's most radical elements will only empower them to turn their attention one day to the \"oppressed\" Muslims of Russia.</p>",
  "<h2>Hitchcock goes to Hollywood</h2> <p>Hitchcock's arrival in the USA, in early 1939, gave him access to greater resources and to a global cinema audience. In the 1950s, Hitchcock was greatly admired by the young French film-makers of the Nouvelle Vague who recognised and promoted his work as that of a cinematic auteur and as a master of studio technique.</p> <p>The highpoint of Hitchcock's career is generally agreed to be the sequence of films beginning with Rear Window (1954) and continuing with Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963).</p> <h2>Hitchcock and voyeurism</h2> <p>Three of these films: Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho, constitute a trilogy that explores the theme of voyeurism. This was especially significant in the later 1950s, as it introduced a psychological concept that had been explained to a popular audience, in part at least, by Freud.</p> <p>The voyeuristic observer, hidden or otherwise, and with the obsessive personality associated with sexual dysfunction, became a staple, not just for Hitchcock, but for the whole of cinema. The cinematic experience became understood as psychologically contiguous to voyeurism. Hitchcock even developed a special zoom effect used in the film to suggest the sensation of vertigo.</p> <p>The voyeuristic eroticism associated with Hitchcock's exploration of psychological suspense was heightened by the director's use of cool and elegant blondes. In Vertigo, Kim Novak leads.</p> <h2>Saul Bass</h2> <p>The poster for Vertigo is by Saul Bass, who was a pioneer of film-title sequences and of film poster design. Bass conceived the title sequence as an integral part of the film and as something that could, through the use of music, typography and moving image, establish the mood and emotional register of a film.</p> <p>Before Bass, which is to say, before about 1955, film titles were presented as a throw-back to the silent era. Titles and credits were shown as a sequence of static cards with the acting and production credits drawn onto them.</p> <p>The big colour productions of the 1950s greatly extended the production credits. Incorporating this extra information into the title sequence made it too long. Accordingly, the credits began to be organised so that title and big names were placed at the front of the film and production and general credits at the end. So, part of what Bass was doing was a pragmatic choice to organise this information clearly.</p> <p>Bass famously worked with Otto Preminger and with Alfred Hitchcock. He designed the posters and title sequences for Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. Martin Scorsese persuaded him to create the title sequence for Casino (1995).</p> <h2>Vertigo</h2> <p>The poster for Vertigo combines several elements that we've discussed previously. The design is based on a simplified two-colour process that uses hand-cut lettering against a bright orange background. The tiny portraits of James Stewart and Kim Novak are the only photo-mechanical elements in the design.</p> <p>The technical specification for the poster reads as a screenprint. The small photographic elements, hand-cut type and solid bright orange are all indicators of this process. Accordingly, the film is positioned as an edgy and psychologically complex story, slightly outside the Hollywood mainstream.</p> <h2>Hand-drawn lettering and hypotrochoid curves</h2> <p>The tradition of hand-drawn lettering goes back to the German expressionist films of the 1920s. These films were pioneers of the horror genre and created a film world of oblique angles and vertiginous perspectives. The hand-drawn lettering for these films rejected the curves and serifs of traditional typefaces for something altogether more edgy and visceral.</p> <p>The main visual element in the Bass poster is a geometric pattern based on hypotrochoid curves. These curves are familiar from the popular Spirograph toys of the 1970s. The curves provide a complex manipulation of the normal grid-spaces of our concrete and psychological environments.</p>"
