Executives were busy interviewing hopefuls for 40 new staff positions, which include a position data and mapping expert and digital technologist. And today, the Telegraph Media Group plans to function without a single casual reporter - a historic day in Fleet Street.</p> <p>If the newspaper industry is undergoing a revolution, then the Telegraph is perhaps more like France than most. Since the Barclay brothers bought the titles and the Spectator for \u00a3665m in June 2004, five editors have come and gone and the rate and pace of change at the biggest-selling quality daily newspaper has surprised rivals and staff alike. In integrating the daily title with its Sunday sister and online counterpart, Will Lewis, editor in chief of the Telegraph Media Group and editor of the Daily Telegraph for the past two years, has dragged a group once seen as gentlemanly and old-fashioned into the digital era. On one level, the changes have already worked. While the latest circulation figures show a year-on-year decline of the daily title by 3% to 887,664 in August, unique users to Telegraph.co.uk have more than doubled to 18,746,025 over the past year.</p> <p><strong>Stars on high salaries</strong><br>Friday's ABC figures also suggest that the title is weathering the downward circulation trend better than many of its quality rivals even before the tardy colour launch (although just 44% were sold at full cover price). Its once-derided subscription model is now being copied by at least one of its nearest rivals, the Times. Executives point to the millions invested in the Victoria HQ and the multimedia expansion, and say the editorial budget has never been higher. Yet staff discontent, fuelled by the drastic upheaval to working conditions and editorial judgements , has never seemed greater.</p> <p>Last week's full colour launch - after difficult print site negotiations - was welcomed by Lewis. He downplays talk of a revolution, describing the launch as an \"evolution\". \"This is a big thing for us, the market-leading newspaper, to have colour,\" he says, suggesting that the paper decided a softly-softly approach would be best for readers. \"It's not about trying to impress any Guardian aficionados. We haven't made any radical changes.\" Yet the plan to denude the company of casual workers, so long a mainstay of Fleet Street, is radical, and vital to both the Telegraph titles' continuing integration and its plans to keep website readership surging by employing web specialists. By October 13, all casual production staff will have followed reporters out of the door. </p> <p>In a letter to casuals, the executive director of editorial, Richard Ellis, said: \"TMG will use no casuals whatsoever\" after this time, describing the 40 new staff roles as \"wide-ranging and exciting\". There are to be about 18 content editors who will write, commission and edit across online and print as well as six reporters, five part-time production roles and seven \"new world\" roles, such as a digital technologist geo-tagging news stories for local readers. </p> <p>The high-tech titles of the jobs have caused some angst among staff, but Lewis says, \"I must be the only editor in the UK appointing people to jobs. This must be a golden time for our organisation.\" </p> <p>Such comments mark a contrast to many of those who have left the Telegraph titles in the past four years. Disgruntled members of this diaspora have compared Lewis and a team dominated by former Associated Newspapers executives with the Khmer Rouge wreaking Year Zero on a once great institution, and building a downmarket \"Daily Mailygraph\" in its place. Executives, on the other hand, suggest they razed the doomed country club of the old Telegraph and built a digital Jerusalem in its place. </p> <p>The gap between these views is perhaps at the heart of why current relations seem so fraught. The ballot has been called because of changed working practices. Among other things management is accused of failing to honour the guarantee that helped to stave off the last planned strike, in December 2006, that staff would work a maximum of 15 Saturdays a year. </p> <p>The dispute centres on 62 production workers whom management want to move from a nine-day to a 10-day fortnight. \"I didn't expect to be cheered to the rafters doing that,\" says Lewis. \"If you say there are still some unhappy people, then I am sure there are - it's not Disneyland here.\" </p> <p>But if he didn't remove the casuals, which he thinks the company is too reliant on, staff jobs would have had to go, he says. There are 30 casuals work more than four days per week but many more working less. After the latest round of hires, the group will have 550 staff journalists spread over three platforms compared with 520 when the Barclays took over. These figures hide an enormous turnaround of staff, however, with two big rounds of redundancies, many departures and a host of new hirings from rival newspapers. These new arrivals tend to be much more positive about working at the Telegraph, of course, compared with some longer serving members of staff.</p> <p>The union negotiations are being handled by Ellis, who reports to the chief executive, Murdoch MacLennan. The union say that they have repeatedly tried to take the matter to the reconciliation service Acas and are getting knocked back. </p> <p>Chris Howe, made father of chapel after his predecessor was made redundant in June, says: \"Forty new jobs is a great-sounding headline, but many, many more so-called 'casual' workers are being dismissed across all departments, some of whom have been working here regularly for many years. We can see that the new jobs won't fill the gap because of the punitive changes being imposed on existing staff to cover the extra workload.\"</p> <p>Howe charges that the Telegraph's management fails to respect its agreements or negotiate. \"And the last thing we want is to damage the Telegraph. We are determined to protect the reputation of a great paper from a management that has made an ideology out of bad industrial relations.\"</p> <p>Posted this week, the ballot results are expected in six weeks. The union says it had 205 members at the last audit but has added more recently. It has not been known for activism.</p> <p>Lewis, who says that he has spent a long time briefing journalists about the changes, does not think that a strike will happen. \"I would be staggered - but if they do I will deal with it,\" he says. </p> <p>TMG is not the only company making journalists redundant, of course. After the merger of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People features desks, and the cutting of eight desk editing posts at the Daily Mirror, staff said last week that they fear it is becoming like the Daily Express, a reference to the swingeing cost cuts at the Richard Desmond title. The Guardian has instituted a programme of voluntary redundancies in editorial to rebalance its staff and recruit more web journalists. </p> <p>But at the Telegraph relations have seemed so much tougher, partly due to the scale and pace of change.The City desk, which pioneered integration, has seen 10 staff leaving in the past year and the departure of Paul Hill, the linchpin of the foreign desk with 37 years' service, also hit staff morale. His staff accorded him the old Fleet Street printers' farewell of a banging out. </p> <p>Ben Rooney, a staff journalist in the 1990s who left a part-time job on the foreign desk after Hill's departure earlier this year, echoes other former staff critical of what he describes as the paper apeing of its downmarket rivals, with desk editors forced to check the Daily Mail's website constantly and berated for failing to follow stories. \"Even if they were utter shite, you had to run them, or face a grilling if you didn't,\" he says. Senior Telegraph executives dismiss the suggestion that they have gone downmarket, saying that they have simply imported the Mail high standards and rigour. </p> <p>In an interview last year, Lewis said: \"Each of the people that we have recruited from Associated have awed me with their professionalism, their work ethic, their technical skills, their creativity, which is often overlooked.\" </p> <p>At that time he also said his longterm strategy was only half complete and there was much more to be done in pushing Telegraph content out deeper and deeper into the web. Since then the economic downturn has given pause for thought, but the pace of change has continued.</p> <p>Last week Lewis said he had to ensure that the strategy of creating a global media operation does not \"lose momentum\" while the company \"battens down the hatches\". There is little sign that the revolution at the Telegraph is slowing down.</p> <h2>Four years of change at the Telegraph</h2> <p><strong>2004: Barclays take over</strong><br>David and Frederick Barclay take control after Conrad Black fails to thwart the \u00a3665m sale.

  "<p>The BBC Trust will today launch a review of the way the licence fee is collected. Led by BBC chairman Sir Michael Lyons, it will attempt to reduce evasion of the \u00a3139.50 annual charge but will also examine complaints that its marketing and collection tactics are heavy-handed. </p> <p>The compulsory tax, which brings in \u00a33.4bn a year for the corporation, is payable by everyone who owns a television or other device that allows them to watch or record live programmes. </p> <p>The BBC took over responsibility for the collection of the licence fee in 1991, and since then the evasion rate has fallen from 12.9% to 5.1%. It contracts out responsibility for collection to several external agencies. \"The BBC has a duty to be efficient in collecting the licence fee and to keep evasion rates as low as possible so that those people who pay are not disadvantaged by those who do not,\" said Lyons. \"This is an issue which arouses strong emotions, because the right balance needs to be struck between ensuring compliance with the law and avoiding any disproportionate heavy-handedness.\" </p> <p>He promised that changes would be made if there was found to be \"room for improvements\". A consultation launched today will collect views from the public as well as BBC management and TV Licensing agencies, before the trust delivers its verdict next spring. Among other questions, the public consultation will ask whether \"the tone of the marketing and advertising about the TV licence is appropriate\".</p> <p>Although 98% of households have a television, the early popularity of on-demand services such as the BBC iPlayer has led some MPs and broadcasting executives to question whether the law may need to be changed. As it stands, a licence is not required if consumers can prove they are only watching on-demand services to catch up on programmes that have already been broadcast. </p> <p>The review comes at a sensitive time for the BBC. The government last year guaranteed the licence fee until 2013 but broke the historic link with inflation, pegging increases on a sliding scale until then. By 2013, it will cost \u00a3151 a year.</p> <p>The trend towards more houses with single occupants will also help the BBC. </p> <p>But with increased media fragmentation and declining viewing on its main channels, the BBC faces a battle to convince the public the licence fee remains good value for money in providing a range of services and adding to British cultural life. One of the priorities for the BBC in recent years has been to remind licence fee payers that while the annual charge is based on television ownership, it funds a wide range of services including radio and online. </p> <p>A recent Ipsos Mori survey for MediaGuardian showed that support for the licence fee appeared to be less widespread than the BBC has claimed. </p> <p>Asked whether the licence fee was good value for money, 47% of those polled disagreed. The poll also showed support for the licence fee eroded the further away people lived from London and among those in lower socio-economic groups.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following clarification was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday September 15 2008. The above report was wrong to say that the licence fee is payable by everyone who owns a television or other device that allows them to watch or record live programmes. You do not have to pay if you are 75 or older.</p>",
  "<p>There were quite a few raised establishment eyebrows when Sir Denis Rooke, who has died aged 84, became a member of the Order of Merit in 1997. What was a gas engineer doing alongside the likes of Lord Menuhin, Baroness Thatcher, Lucian Freud, Sir John Gielgud, Dame Joan Sutherland and the Duke of Edinburgh? But the Queen had decided that Rooke was entitled to join that select band of 24 - and, of course, she was justified. Rooke was an outstanding engineer, not simply Mr Gas Industry, but one of Britain's most distinguished civil engineers.</p> <p>Of course, he had critics - even some enemies - because of his abrasiveness; he was openly dismissive of \"silly people\" - journalists, merchant bankers, politicians and a few civil servants. He admired, and liked, practical people, especially those who had tasted some experience of life outside the City and Whitehall; he often appeared unyielding and unforgiving to the fumbling contradictions of political life, and he certainly had a very low threshold of patience with fools.</p> <p>Yet those who admired his skills, wisdom, analytical power and plain common sense regarded him as one of the outstanding figures of British industry, in public or private sectors. He was the longest-serving chairman of any of the nationalised industries, serving for 13 years (1976 to 1989) from the days of the old Gas Council, through the years of the British Gas Corporation and into the privatised British Gas plc. He had also been deputy chairman from 1972 till 1976.</p> <p>It was a long and mostly immensely successful period, in which the nationalised gas industry turned in huge profits, a substantial slice of which was collected by the Treasury. Rooke would point out angrily to indiscriminate critics of public sector industries that gas helped to subsidise others.</p> <p>His rise was due entirely to his engineering and scientific skills. With his high qualifications, both in mechanical and chemical engineering, Rooke was selected in the 1950s to be a member of a small team of technicians that pioneered the sea transportation of liquefied natural gas. He had been spotted as a potential high-flyer in the early 1950s following a brilliant performance at an Oxford management conference attended by top industrialists, in particular by Sir Kenneth Hutchison, who subsequently became the Gas Council's deputy chairman. </p> <p>In 1959, with Rooke in charge, the Methane Pioneer, a specially redesigned 5,000-ton ship, made the difficult journey from north Africa, carrying 2,000 tons of liquefied natu ral gas. The purpose was to prove the technology for commercial imports of Algerian natural gas. </p> <p>Rooke had already been in charge of trial runs across the Atlantic - once in a 23-day battle against continous gales because they had to avoid normal shipping lanes, especially in bad weather. The ship could easily have exploded had it struck another vessel, since the liquefied gas was so cold it would have cracked open the strongest steel hull. The experiment was deemed necessary because of the gas industry's fight to control costs - especially of coal. </p> <p>It was a phase in Rooke's experience that he never forgot, though never exulted in nor even willingly discussed. His final years as Mr Gas Industry were dominated by his battles with Nigel Lawson, then Margaret Thatcher's energy secretary. Rooke's concern was not so much whether the gas industry was nationalised or privatised; he wanted it protected from predators. And in this he did regard public ownership as the more likely ally, albeit for practical and industrially rational reasons rather than from any ideological commitment. His view was simply stated: \"The shape of the industry has been rationalised by history and should not be tampered with.\" It was an argument that Lawson, first as energy secretary and then chancellor, found intolerable.</p> <p>From the moment Lawson entered Thatcher's cabinet in September 1981 as energy secretary he was at war with Rooke. He correctly saw the Gas Council chairman as the strongest of his foes in the public sector, opposed to the ideological thrust of Thatcherite privatisation. Lawson quickly concluded that Rooke's gas empire was the mountain he had to conquer. As he later admitted in his book The View from No 11 (1992), Rooke was \"my most formidable opponent\". Lawson had become persuaded that nuclear energy was the key to the country's energy future requirements, and apart from being a useful weapon against Arthur Scargill's miners, he also saw nuclear power as an instrument in his fight with nationalised gas. He decided to act against Rooke's gas pricing policy which, Lawson was convinced, gave domestic consumers gas at too low prices and charged industry too much. </p> <p>Rooke's case was that since gas was \"a premium fuel\", the domestic consumer should have the better deal. Lawson disagreed. So they fought tenaciously, first over prices and then over privatisation. The cabinet, under Lawson's advice, removed all remaining restrictions on imported gas and raised prices by 10%, the first of three increases in preparation for privatisation. Rooke declared war. </p> <p>But he was up against the severe handicap of facing a Thatcher government, with Lawson then very close to the prime minister, determined to beat him - and with the power to do so. Even when Lawson became chancellor and Peter Walker succeeded him at energy, Lawson still played a crucial role in trying to outsmart Rooke. By then, however, Walker had established an altogether different relationship with the British Gas chairman, whom he admired personally and regarded as \"the best nationalised chairman I have met\". Had it been left to the Walker-Rooke axis, the industry may not have been privatised at all. </p> <p>In contrast, Walker and Lawson clashed fiercely. Chancellor Lawson wanted to break up the industry after privatising it; Walker flatly refused, arguing that such a policy would be \"lunacy\". In fact, Walker finally accepted privatisation in 1986 only on the terms that Rooke had been demanding - that the industry should remain in one piece. As Rooke remarked to an interviewer 10 years later, \"There isn't any doubt, it was a hell of a battle. One of the people who hated my guts from my feet to the top of my head was Nigel Lawson.\" No exaggeration there, though the hatred was mutual.</p> <p>Rooke was the son of a south London commercial traveller who, in his own terms, \"came from a simple working-class family\". He was a precocious child and was sent to school at three years old, but then immediately became ill and was in and out of hospitals for the next four years. At seven, he still could not read. Then, at Westminster City school, he made exceptional progress and went on to the Addey and Stanhope school, in Lewisham, and University College London, where he graduated in mechanical engineering. Later he did a postgraduate diploma in chemical engineering. </p> <p>From 1944 he served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (Reme) in Britain and India, rising to the rank of major, and in 1949 he joined the staff of the South-eastern Gas Board. That was also the year he married Brenda Evans - and the year the gas industry was nationalised. Eight years later he moved to the North Thames Gas Board, where he began work on liquefied natural gas.</p> <p>He was appointed CBE in 1970, knighted in 1977 and became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1978. From 1989 to 2003 he was the chancellor of what is now Loughborough University, and he was awarded several honorary degrees. His great love, outside his family and the gas industry, was music and opera. Brenda and his daughter Diana survive him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Denis Eric Rooke, industrialist, born April 2 1924; died September 2 2008</p>",
  "<p>There is a lot of confusion over exactly what workplace rights women hold when they become pregnant, particularly over returning to their job.</p> <p>By law, new mothers can take up to 52 weeks' maternity leave. If the worker decides to return to work within 26 weeks of starting maternity leave, she has the right to go back to her original job. If she stays off work for longer, her rights are slightly different. This disparity in treatment seems to have prompted unions to demand that there be \"no detriment for mothers coming back to work.\" Labour's apparent acceptance of the unions' position has led to reports that employers could be obliged to \"keep women's jobs open for a year of maternity leave\".<br> The reality, however, is that in most cases employers already do have to keep a woman's job open for a full year of maternity leave. The circumstances in which an employer can refuse to keep a woman who has taken more than 26 weeks' maternity leave on in her old job are strictly limited. For starters, the employer has to be able to show that it is 'not reasonably practicable' to take the employee back on in her old role. This means more than 'it's not convenient' or 'we prefer the person we brought in to replace you.' Even if the employer overcomes this hurdle, the maternity returner cannot be shunted into any old job. The new role has to be suitable and appropriate for the employee to do, taking into account her status, place of work etc. What is more, the terms and conditions of the new position must be no less favourable than those that would have applied in her old job. All in all, this could mean that an employee who cannot be returned to their old job might have to be slotted in to a 'better' position. Certainly it means that there is already protection against suffering no detriment. When it comes to redundancy situations, a woman on maternity leave is in an even better position than she would be if she were at work, at least from a legal perspective. If it is not practicable to continue to employ a woman on maternity leave due to redundancy, then as with any other employee, the employer need not keep her job open. However, should a suitable alternative vacancy arise before her employment ends, the absent employee must be offered the position in preference to other potential employees who may also be redundant, even if others might be better qualified for the role. This is a form of positive discrimination that can come as something of a surprise to managers. All of this adds up to a body of laws that is designed to ensure women are protected when they take maternity leave. Even those women who choose to take advantage of their full 12-month leave entitlement enjoy a high degree of legal protection. The fact that these laws exist does not, of course, mean that women do not suffer discrimination at work because of pregnancy and maternity leave. In redundancy situations, for example, some women who are away from the workplace find they are not consulted about changes in the same way as they would be if at work: out of sight - out of mind. This is unlawful; yet it happens. In 2005 the Equal Opportunities Commission reported appalling levels of pregnancy discrimination. Although employers' groups disputed the accuracy of the commission's statistics, a steady stream of employment tribunal claims is evidence enough that maternity discrimination still exists.  If pregnancy discrimination is perceived to be a real problem then the solution does not lie in adding to the already substantial body of law. Efforts would be better directed at improving compliance with existing legislation.</p> <p>\u0095 Audrey Williams is head of discrimination law at Eversheds</p>",
  "<p>Immigrants went on the rampage yesterday after a Senegalese man was stabbed to death in a southern Spanish resort town popular with British expatriates.</p> <p>Barricades were erected, at least two houses were set on fire and nine cars were damaged in Roquetas de Mar, a small town 15 miles east of Almer\u00eda.</p> <p>The violence flared in an area with a large immigrant population after the 28-year-old man died. Firefighters, trying to put out the blazes, described the scene as a \"pitched battle\" between immigrants and riot police.</p> <p>Police said the violence, which started just before midnight on Saturday, was brought under control at 5am.</p> <p>Four men were arrested, two from Guinea Bissau, one from Nigeria and one from Sudan. </p> <p>Four police officers were injured. A spokesman said: \"For reasons which the police are investigating, [the man] was attacked by a person from the neighbourhood who police are looking for.\"</p> <p>The scenes on the streets of the resort town in Andalucia, which has a population of 71,000, were more reminiscent of riots in the suburbs of Paris.</p> <p>It is the worst rioting involving immigrants in the region since 2000, when three murders in nearby El Ejido were carried out in the space of two weeks. They were apparently committed by Moroccans, and triggered racist violence that led to 23 arrests and 50 injuries and prompted an official protest from Morocco.</p> <p>Despite having one of the fastest rising immigration rates in Europe in the past decade, Spain has largely escaped violence linked to immigration such as that seen in France.</p> <p>Police in Roquetas de Mar said trouble flared when the Senegalese man, whose initials were given as OK, was stabbed when he reportedly tried to intervene in a row over drugs.</p> <p>Miguel Corpas, of the Almer\u00eda regional government, told the Cadena Ser radio station that \"a large group [of immigrants] wanted to take justice into their own hands\".</p> <p>He added that a \"fierce battle took place [in which] the immigrants took to the streets to try to stop the firefighters putting out the fires\".</p> <p>Corpas said the rioters erected barricades, and set fire to containers and to two houses that were completely destroyed. Rioters stoned the firefighters, according to some reports.</p> <p>A quarter of the town's population are said to be African immigrants who come to work in construction or in businesses set up by foreigners.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of children, some as young as nine, are being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad's prisons, sleeping in sweltering temperatures in overcrowded cells without working fans, no daily access to showers, and subject to frequent sexual abuse by guards, current and former prisoners say.</p> <p>At Karkh juvenile prison, Omar Ali, a 16-year-old who has spent more than three years there, showed the multiple skin sores he and many other fellow inmates have contracted through lying on thin, sweat-soaked mattresses night after night. </p> <p>\"The electricity comes from a generator and it's only switched on during the two-hour weekly session when visitors come in, and for two or three hours in the evening. We are convinced the guards sell the generator fuel on the black market,\" he said.</p> <p>Daytime temperatures in Baghdad last week averaged 44C (112F). They barely drop below 38C at night. Water supplies in Karkh are spasmodic, and Omar said he was able to shower only once every three days. Boys sleep in four dormitories, averaging 75 inmates in a cell about 5 metres by 10 metres, on double bunks or the concrete floor.</p> <p>Guards often take boys to a separate room in the prison and rape them, Omar alleged. They also break prison rules by lending their mobile phones to boys to ring home, on condition that each time their families top the phone up by $10 or $20. The teaching staff resigned en masse in November because of low pay, according to an international official. As a result, the children lounge around aimlessly with no daytime activities, other than an exercise yard. </p> <p>Though the boys in the prison have been convicted, international standards for fair trials are never met. \"Trials last on average for 25 minutes, no witnesses are called, confessions are used as the only evidence, and court-appointed defence lawyers get the case file on the day of the trial, leaving no chance to consult the defendant in private,\" an international adviser in Baghdad said on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>Omar Ali was 13 when interior ministry special forces raided his house in a predominantly Sunni suburb in October 2004. He and his 14-year-old brother were arrested. A week later the special forces came back and took their father. All three are still in custody. </p> <p>The ministry is under Shia control and its forces have repeatedly been accused of targeting innocent Sunnis. Sahar Muhammad, the boys' mother, told the Guardian that when she was able to visit her sons they told her they were beaten repeatedly in the first days of custody and ordered to sign a blank sheet of paper on which charges would be written later.</p> <p>Raad Jamal was 17 when US forces raided his home in the mixed Sunni and Shia district of Doura in June last year. His mother, Suad Ahmed Rashid, who was with him during the interview, told the Guardian: \"During the US raid an American officer told my daughter: 'Tell your brother to confess he is with al-Qaida so we can send him to Camp Bucca [a US prison near Basra] or else we'll hand him to the Iraqis and they will torture him'.\"</p> <p>Raad and a friend were taken to a US base and were transferred next morning to the seventh brigade of the Iraqi army's second regiment. Raad said he and his friend were hung from the ceiling on ropes, beaten with electric cables, and taken for interrogation one by one. \"They said everyone who comes here has to confess,\" Raad said.</p> <p>He was then sent to another Iraqi army base. \"I stayed there about six months. I didn't confess anything I didn't do. They write false statements and ask you to press your thumb on it. I refused but they forced my thumb on to the paper,\" he said. At the juvenile court Raad encountered a sympathetic judge. </p> <p>\"The judge did not accept my confession. He said I was innocent but for administrative reasons I would have to go to Tobchi until I was released.\" He spent a few months in Tobchi and was released in March.</p> <p>Last year officials from the United Nations Assistance Mission to Iraq (Unami) visited Baghdad's Tobchi prison, where children awaiting trial are held. They reported that detainees provided \"particularly worrisome allegations of ill-treatment or other abuse of juvenile males, several of whom told Unami they had been beaten and sexually abused while held in the custody of the ministries of the interior and defence prior to transfer to a juvenile facility. Upon examining them Unami observed injuries consistent with beatings.\"</p> <p>The UN found severe overcrowding at Tobchi, with around 400 inmates in a prison with an official capacity of 206. \"In some cells juveniles were taking turns to sleep on the floor without mattresses,\" the UN reported. The ministry of labour and social affairs (Molsa), which manages the prison, said shortages of funds prevented improvements. </p> <p>Kadhim Raouf Ali, deputy director general of Molsa's juvenile department, told the Guardian that inmate numbers in Tobchi had been sharply reduced this year thanks to speeded-up releases under the new amnesty law. There were only 226 inmates now. But he admitted Karkh was still overcrowded. It was holding 315 children while capacity was 250. </p> <p>Child detainees in US custody in Iraq fare better than those in Iraqi hands, said Shatha Alobosi, an Iraqi woman MP. Former inmates interviewed by the Guardian confirmed that there is less overcrowding and brutality. </p> <p>Now, as Iraqi pressure mounts for a return of sovereignty, the US has been moving to release all under-18s. In December last year it held 950 children. The current total is 180. </p> <p>\"We anticipate having less than 100 juveniles in detention by the end of Ramadan [later this month], and hopefully release all juveniles to their families before the end of this year,\" First Lieutenant Randi Norton, a US military spokesman, said.</p> <p>The Iraqi Islamic party, the main Sunni party in parliament, takes a special interest in detainees, adult as well as juvenile, since the majority are Sunnis. It gives aid to poor families who have no breadwinner, and has urged the authorities to improve conditions and release prisoners. </p> <p>\"We still have a long way to go. The problem is how to make a major and drastic reform of the judicial system, and change the mentality of officers in the army and police,\" its leader, the Iraqi vice president Tariq al-Hashemi, told the Guardian. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>An Iraqi contributed reporting for this article.

  "<p>Your uncritical presentation of a recent academic study alleging that \"institutional racism\" is the main factor in black pupil underachievement was hardly news (Black Caribbean children held back by institutional racism in schools, September 5). This ideological-based claim that it is teachers' low expectations, particularly for children of Caribbean origin, which make them achieve low GCSE and A-level grades has been around for decades. </p> <p>Yet the only exhaustive, comprehensive and authoritative study of the subject - the Swann Report of 1985 - categorically dismissed those claims after seven years' detailed research by leading educational and ethnic minority issue specialists in the field. One hopes that the British Educational Research Association conference will examine Dr Strand's study rigorously, as to whether his findings and conclusions provide new evidence which was not considered and rejected by Swann. </p> <p>When it was a major issue in the 1980s, this focus on a blame-laden but evidentially unproven factor - alleged teachers' and educational authority racism - caused serious black community distrust in the whole educational system, without in any way helping them to tackle the complex and multi-factorial problems which all the studies acknowledged. </p> <p>The political reaction to the excesses of many London councils' well-intentioned but ill-considered \"anti-racist\" policies (such as Brent's notorious persecution of \"racist\" headteacher Maureen McGoldrick and their wild \"race spies in the classrooms\" programme) enabled the radical right to exploit all parent and public concerns about how education was run. The results, starting with the Education Act 1988, are with us today. Twenty years on, we really should expect a more balanced treatment of such sensitive issues.<br><strong>Cllr Dr James Moher</strong> <br>Lab, Brent; author of Stepping on White Corns - Race, Education and Politics: the Brent Experience</p> <p>The underachievement of black children is not a new phenomenon. Nor is the notion of low teacher expectation leading to poor pupil performance. Bernard Coard in 1971 researched the issue in his book: How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System. The Rampton committee (later to become the Swann committee) reported on the underachievement of black children and there have been numerous pieces of research on the relationship between teacher expectation and pupil performance - notably one where researchers supposedly identified children who would \"spurt\" over a six-month period - and they did. The researchers then revealed to the teachers that the children had been selected at random. They \"spurted\" because teachers believed that they would. </p> <p>More damning was 1980s research into one large education authority (I shan't name it as it may have changed since then) which showed that, exactly like today, white students were put into higher academic sets (with a possibility of achieving A-grades) when their performance was worse than that of their black peers - who were put into sets where an A-grade was not a possibility.</p> <p>What is so appalling is that over 35 years since Coard's research, and 25-plus years since Rampton and Swann, for black children nothing has changed and teachers continue to make stereotypical false assumptions - and continue to fail and blame them.<br><strong>Carole Underwood</strong><br>Kendal, Cumbria</p> <p>Tony Sewell's indictment (Comment, September 6) of the intellectually lightweight study from Warwick University of the poor performance of African-Caribbean children in our schools was electrifying. It is supported by the evidence collected by Professor James Flynn of Otago University on IQ among black children in the US and the black offspring of US servicemen in Germany; the latter, not exposed to the corrosive male machismo subculture of US inner cities, have the same IQ as white children fathered by white servicemen, whereas in the US the gap between whites and blacks at age 24 is 16 points (see New Scientist, September 6 2008). It is not hard to extend the argument that the culture many children are exposed to in the UK (content-free newspapers and TV, celebrity worship and so on) has a similar effect - especially as so many white youths copy the attitudes and style of black role models, dismissing education as something oppressive imposed by the snobbish establishment. <br><strong>Mike Rennie</strong><br>Derby</p> <p>Your article was dispiriting and prompted me to look up a letter I sent to my local education authority when I resigned as chair from a secondary school parent-staff association in 2005. My letter raised similar concerns - some which related to my mixed-race daughter's experience of the school environment.</p> <p>But what concerned me then and now is the lack of a systematic strategy to address the underachievement and stereotyping of black and mixed-race children over time. This needs to be multi-dimensional as Tony Sewell suggests. It also needs to look at difficult issues such as some teachers' fear of black young people, the impact of the gun and knife culture, and the middle-class exodus that exists with secondary schools. </p> <p>It's good to hear about the introduction of study into slavery in the school curriculum and its direct and indirect impact on our economy, culture and psyche. Hopefully well-researched studies like Warwick's alongside the campaigns of parents, their families and educationists will prompt action and more fundamental change. We may get somewhere in realising the potential of those \"difficult black kids\".<br><strong>Guy Farrar</strong><br>Leeds</p>",
  "<p>Financial markets are forecast to react favourably today to the US government's move to take mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into temporary public ownership, ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the two institutions for several months.</p> <p>The FTSE 100, which fell sharply last week on fears for the health of the British economy, is likely to bounce higher in early dealings on relief that the US government has stepped in to stave off the possible collapse of the two lenders, which have lent or guaranteed nearly half of the US's $12tn (\u00a37tn) of mortgage debt.</p> <p>\"I think the stockmarket is going to take this as a positive,\" said William Larkin, of Cabot Money Management in Massachusetts. \"The government is going to be pulling a lot of this stuff on to [its] balance sheet and that may be a concern for the dollar but it is going to be a positive for our financial system.\"</p> <p>Peter Kenny at Knight Equity Markets in New Jersey added: \"It's probably a good move for the markets in the short term. [But] it's not going to address declining house prices.\"</p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, when announcing the move into \"conservatorship\", as temporary nationalisation is known in the US, reminded the world how important the two companies are: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in our financial markets at home and around the globe.\"</p> <p>Freddie and Fannie have run up debts of some $1.6tn over the past year as a result of falling house prices and rising mortgage defaults. Paulson announced in July that the government would begin buying shares in the two companies and guarantee their loans but the latest step had also been widely expected.</p> <p>Paulson denied, however, that the move would cost taxpayers billions: \"Federal Housing Finance Agency [FHFA] and the treasury have acted on the responsibilities we have to protect the stability of the financial markets, including the mortgage market, and to protect the taxpayer to the maximum extent possible.\"</p> <p>The FHFA, which was formed in July from three former housing regulators to take control of the mortgage crisis, will run the two institutions. </p> <p>Paulson said the executives and board of directors of both lenders had been replaced. Herb Allison, a former vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch, was selected to head Fannie Mae, and David Moffett, a former vice-chairman of US Bancorp, was picked to head Freddie Mac.</p> <p>Paulson said shareholders, who will be left with only a small share in the business, will be expected to absorb any further losses before the taxpayer becomes liable. He added that all voting rights would switch to the government and 80% of the common stock \"on a fully diluted basis at a nominal price\". Analysts said the combined effect of these policies would in effect wipe out the value of any existing shares in the lenders.</p> <p>Though house prices in some parts of the US appear to be bottoming out after more than two years of falls, analysts warned that the housing market is not yet out of the woods.</p> <p>\"Mortgage delinquencies continue to set new records, promising more losses and future write-offs for banks and other mortgage lenders,\" said economists at the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort.</p> <p>\"The problems are spreading from the sub-prime sector to prime loans, particularly to mortgages with adjustable rates and optional payment features. With unemployment rising faster, cyclical problems will now compound the damage caused by falling house prices.\"</p>",
  "<p>Israel's police force has recommended that the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, be indicted for bribery, money laundering, fraud and breach of trust, following an 18-month investigation.</p> <p>Olmert is accused of receiving $150,000 (\u00a384,000) in cash for political campaigns over a 10-year period, accepting tens of thousands of dollars in upgraded air tickets and expensive hotel rooms and of double-billing Jewish philanthropic organisations, including Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and the Soldiers' Welfare Fund, to the tune of $110,000.</p> <p>Police are also considering whether to recommend that Olmert be indicted for a third scandal, dubbed the investment centre affair, in which he, while serving as industry minister, allegedly granted state funds to a company represented by his close associate and former law partner, Uri Messer. </p> <p>Dogged by a string of corruption investigations, of which there have been five since he replaced Ariel Sharon as prime minister in 2006, Olmert announced in July that he would resign when his ruling party, Kadima, holds its primaries.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, is expected to replace Olmert as prime minister when the leadership ballot is held on September 17.</p> <p>However, polling suggests that Livni and her party will struggle to win at the next general election, which the Likud leader and former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu is predicted to win.</p> <p>Olmert has repeatedly denied the allegations ever since they were made public on the eve of the country's 60th birthday celebrations earlier this year. </p> <p>Last night his lawyers issued a statement saying that the police recommendations were of \"no value\" because the attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, was required to assess the evidence and decide whether to lay charges.</p> <p>\"We will wait patiently for the decision of the attorney general. Unlike the police, he is aware of the heavy responsibility he holds,\" the statement said.</p> <p>But Mazuz is under growing public pressure to claim a political scalp, after he recently abandoned pursuing fraud and money laundering charges against the leader of the rightwing Yisrael Beiteinu party, Avigdor Lieberman, and jettisoned rape charges against Israel's former president, Moshe Katsav, to accept a plea bargain for a host of lesser sexual offences, which the accused subsequently rejected.</p> <p>On being appointed as attorney general, Mazuz initially took a tough stance against political corruption, but his credibility with the Israeli public withered after he dropped corruption charges against Olmert's predecessor, Sharon, who was also dogged by allegations of corruption.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Sharon's son, Omri began serving a seven month sentence for violating campaign finance laws, falsifying corporate documents and perjury in relation to the 1999 Likud elections.</p>",
  "<p>It's 3.15 in the afternoon. The clock ticks, the fan whirs. You yawn and stretch, stare at the pile of paperwork that needs to be done. Tick-tock goes the clock. You sigh deeply, stare at your telephone. Try your very hardest not to look at the time - at least for another hour, well, make that half-hour, make that ... God, is it still only 16 minutes past three? Has some office wag poured treacle into the clock to slow down the mechanism?</p> <p>Can time actually stand still? Does it ever go backwards? Maybe if I had ever made it past page 13 of A Brief History of Time I could enlighten you, dear reader. But in any case, it's unlikely that either of us needs a brain like Stephen Hawking's to realise what's wrong: you are guilty of that widespread office crime, clock-watching. </p> <p>The minute hand flies round when you're having fun and crawls round like a dozy tortoise when you're not. And while work does not have to be an endless carnival of enjoyment to be worthwhile, you have the right to expect it to be a little more exciting than watching moss grow on a paving stone. So if the period between lunch and your mid-afternoon tea break seems to last longer than the Cold War, how can you bring down the Berlin Wall of office ennui? How can you drag your eyes away from the slowly turning hands of the clock for more than two minutes at a time?</p> <p>The most obvious way to revitalise things is to take a break from the drudgery and do something enjoyable. You could organise an office quiz, for example, or find an equally bored workmate and challenge them to a game of battleships. </p> <p>Ten minutes' fun-time should enliven and refresh you, but don't overdo it. It's amazing how a harmless game of screwed-up-invoice volleyball or inter-desk tiddlywinks can take on a life of its own, especially when the alternative is a pile of soul-destroying filing. </p> <p>And while you might pine like an ardent lover for 5 o'clock to come round, not everyone around you will share your view that the final hours of a working day are purely time to kill. You know the ones - those eager beavers who don't so much as glance at the time, then suddenly chirp up: \"Ooh, quarter past three already - doesn't the time just whiz by!\"</p> <p>Well, watch out, because each time they dash busily past your desk they'll have the chance to note just how little work you're actually doing. And while career highlights can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, being called into the boss's office to explain why the closest you got to strategic business planning this morning was surmising that E4 must be the tip of Simon's battle cruiser will never be one of them. </p> <p>So instead, why not take a leaf out of the eager beavers' book, and make a conscious effort to take an interest in your work, however dull it might seem? In extreme cases, you might think this can only be done under the influence of some powerful psychotropic drug. But fear not, finding work interesting need not necessarily involve becoming convinced that the head of purchasing control has transmogrified into the Lizard King of the Universe and his office is the magic garden at the centre of the sun. </p> <p>It's more a question of changing your attitude. Smile and the world will smile with you, they say. Pretend to like what you're doing, and with luck, you might begin to quite enjoy it.</p> <p>There are snags to thinking positive, of course. Do you really want to join the ranks of people who find deeply dull things interesting, for example? Think of trainspotters, accountants and anyone who was still watching Big Brother last week, and you might be forced to conclude that the best way to make the day fly by couldn't be simpler: go out and get a job you actually enjoy.</p>",
  "<p>When Marc Quinn's 11.5-tonne sculpture of a pregnant Alison Lapper was unveiled in Trafalgar Square on September 15 2005, Ken Livingstone observed that her life was \"a struggle over much greater difficulties than the men who are celebrated here\", referring to Nelson atop his column, George IV, Sir Henry Havelock and Sir Charles Napier. The then mayor of London was making a point about heroism, but he might as well have been making a point about gender. Monumental effigies of women are rare. The city fathers of London prefer even their abstractions to be male, especially if they are going to be naked. Nobody finds it odd that the \"glorious heroes of the machine gun corps who fell in the great war\" should be represented by a beardless male nude. For the millions flowing down Park Lane, the figure, which faces the other way, is just a nude boy with a delectable bum. When Richard Westmacott's Wellington Monument, consisting of a nude figure of Achilles, was unveiled in 1822, there was at least as much twitter about its nudity as there was in 2005 about Alison Lapper's identity, nudity, pregnancy and disability. These days, we are so used to male effigies in civic areas that we are not capable of being shocked by them - but female figures are another matter.</p> <p>No effigies of Margaret Thatcher were made while she was in power. Neil Simmons' undistinguished marble likeness was commissioned by a private patron in 1998, eight years after Thatcher left office; at 8ft tall it was called \"huge\", when it is actually smaller than effigies of less distinguished male prime ministers. If it had been genuinely huge, Paul Kelleher might not have succeeded in knocking its head off a few months after it was unveiled at the Guildhall Gallery. In court, he defended his action as an artistic expression of his \"right to interact with this broken world\". The bronze Thatcher by Antony Dufort that stands holding up a minatory finger in the lobby of the House of Commons is smaller and the head out of scale, so that the great lady appears dwarfed. Neither figure projects any sort of authority; Thatcher is presented as an elderly woman with jowls and a sharp nose. Her Spitting Image puppet is more impressive.</p> <p>In 2002, when Houston was disqualified as a contender for the 2012 Olympics because it lacked \"brand identity\", Texas architect Doug Michels decided what was wanted was an internationally recognisable icon. Michels should be remembered as one of the three men who were responsible for one of the most famous installations of the 20th century, Cadillac Ranch. Although the original paintwork is long gone from the 10 half-buried Cadillacs, which are now covered in graffiti, Cadillac Ranch is still a must-see for any visitor to Texas. Michels teamed up with industrial designer Peter Bollinger and sculptor Cybele Rowe to design the Spirit of Houston, a vast female figure standing with her arms upraised, topping out at 555ft and costing $40m. Clad like Katie Price on her wedding day, in a revealing corselet and enormous skirt that outlined her mountainous mons veneris and more than hemispherical breasts, she was to be constructed out of chromium-plated stainless steel. For all that we can now know, the stupendous vulgarity of the concept was deliberate. In 2003, when Michels fell off a cliff at Eden Bay near Sydney while working on a whale movie, and the half-buried cars of Cadillac Ranch were painted matt black to mourn his passing, the project died with him.</p> <p>The Spirit of Houston would have been the tallest female figure in the world, taller than any of the huge figures of Guan Yin, the \"bodhisattva of compassion\". In April 2005, the tallest of these - at 108 metres, bigger than the Statue of Liberty - was enshrined at the resort of Sanya on the Chinese island of Hainan, in the presence of tens of thousands of devotees. The Hainan statue, which took six years to build and is the fourth tallest statue in the world, is one of three Guan Yin effigies that stand taller than Motherland Calls in Volgograd and Mother Motherland in Kiev. The tallest Madonna, the Virgin of Peace in Trujillo, Venezuela, is smaller than all of them. None of these huge effigies, it need hardly be said, represents a woman who ever lived.</p> <p>Britain's one undeniably monumental female sculpture is entirely recognisable as a flesh-and-blood woman. In 1991, John Clinch was commissioned to make a bronze figure of Swindon's most famous daughter, the film star Diana Dors, who had died of cancer seven years earlier, aged 52. Clinch went to town on an exaggerated version of the blonde bombshell in her heyday, bursting out of the regulation decollete evening gown, nipples akimbo. Nobody has tried to knock her head off. Indeed, when the sculpture fell into disrepair and the council was preparing to scrap it, devoted fans raised enough to restore it. Which is why the bronze Diana Dors can be seen to this day, beckoning all comers to the Shaw Ridge Leisure Complex in west Swindon.</p>",
  "<p>A peer could find himself facing magistrates under asbo legislation after allegedly failing to keep his leylandii hedge under control. </p> <p>There has been a long-running dispute between Lord Rodley, who lives at Tudor Manor in Twyning, near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, and his neighbours, Brian and Kay Singleton, over the hedge.</p> <p>The Singletons claim they are forced to keep the lights on in their home all day and say the hedge is ruining their flower beds and turning their lawn to moss. Mr Singleton also says the lack of light has caused him to suffer from seasonal affective disorder. </p> <p>The case is to be considered by Tewkesbury council's planning committee tomorrow. In a report, planning officials say Lord and Lady Rodley's home is subject to a remedial notice under the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 that requires them to initially reduce part of the hedge to three metres (10ft) high and then not let it grow higher than 3.82 metres. </p> <p>The report says this has not been done and suggests that court proceedings be launched to enforce the remedial notice. </p> <p>Singleton, 73, said: \"Living in the shadow of that hedge has been a total nightmare. \"It's enormous and blocks all the sunlight from our garden and home. We've tried everything to get him to cut it down a bit but he's continued to ignore us.</p> <p>\"I've had enough. It's time the authorities clamped down on this kind of antisocial behaviour.\"</p> <p>Rodley's solicitor, David Golden, said his client was not fit to comment, having recently spent time in hospital suffering with chest pains. Golden said Rodley would contest the case if it went to court, adding: \"My instructions are that he's complied with the council's requirements.\"</p>",
  "<p>Asafa Powell has hinted that he will turn down a $50,000 (\u00a328,300) lump sum in Stuttgart this weekend as he thinks ahead with a view to continuing his rivalry with Usain Bolt next summer. Powell failed in his bid to break Jamaican team-mate Bolt's 100m world record in Rieti, Italy, yesterday afternoon, though he still produced one of the most accomplished performances in the history of sprinting.</p> <p>A year ago, Powell took the world record down from 9.77 to 9.74 on this same track. This time he arrived at the meeting bidding to break the mark of 9.69 that Bolt ran when he won the Olympic title in Beijing. He failed, but still managed a remarkable double of 9.77 to win his heat and, within an hour, 9.82 to win the final.</p> <p>It was the fourth occasion that Powell had recorded 9.77 in his career and came in a week that started with an impressive 9.87 in the rain of Gateshead, 9.72 in Lausanne and 9.82 in Brussels, on Friday night, when he finished second behind Bolt in the Golden League. </p> <p>The main grand prix season ends with the World Athletics Final at the weekend. As Bolt has returned home to Jamaica, Powell would have a clear run to the lucrative first prize. But he said yesterday: \"After seven races in five days I am a little tired. Now, I am going on vacation. The rivalry with Usain will resume in 2009, which will be an important year with the World Championships, but who knows if he and I will have the same form as this year.\" </p> <p>Powell will surely be persuaded by meeting organisers to change his mind about Stuttgart, but when he flew out of the blocks yesterday, the crowd at the Stadio dell'Atletica held their breath. It was in the heats last year that he ran 9.74, and by halfway on this occasion he had the rest of the field beaten to clock 9.77. In </p> <p>the final, he did not make as a good a start but once he moved out of the drive motion, he took control with 40m remaining to beat his fellow Jamaican Michael Frater, who was second in 9.98 with Ronald Pognon, of France, third in 10.10. But in fourth place there was a chink of light for British sprinting.</p> <p>Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, 20, also ran 10.10, a personal best by 0.08. Craig Pickering, his British team-mate, finished seventh in 10.17. Natasha Danvers, who is hoping to be in Stuttgart, was beaten again by Jamaica's Olympic champion Melanie Walker in the 400m hurdles. Walker won in 55.01 with Danvers, who took the bronze medal in Beijing, second in 55.25 and Anastasiya Rabchenyuk, of Ukraine, third in 55.39. </p> <p>In London's Hyde Park, the Ethiopian Meseret Defar defended her adidas Women's Challenge 5k road race as she won in 15:01.</p>",
  "<p>Puzzled expressions are already evident at all levels of British and Irish rugby. Where once there were certainties there are now all kinds of questions, courtesy of the experimental law variations which have clearly rattled Wasps already. The champions of England resembled a parish congregation who had wandered in expecting to sing Jerusalem only to end up mouthing the words to an unfamiliar happy-clappy hymn instead.</p> <p>Irish, on this evidence, will be much more willing converts to the ELV cause, having delivered \"as encouraging a performance as you could wish for\" according to their new head coach, Toby Booth. Mobile teams who can hold their own at set-pieces, without necessarily dominating, and think smarter than the average bear are suddenly much more dangerous. Wasps were made to look pedestrian.</p> <p>Even the Exiles, though, were not entirely comfortable with some of the referee Andrew Small's rulings and Booth will raise a number of issues with the Rugby Football Union's referee, manager Ed Morrison, at a debriefing today. There were endless on-field corrections and clarifications and it is already clear lineout etiquette has disappeared. Expect to see an awful lot of unseemly wrestling for the ball over the touchline as quick throws become as valuable a way of relieving pressure as turnovers. Kicking, too, will proliferate. Irish put boot to ball 33 times, not including restarts, place kicks and penalties, in 80 minutes. The resulting spectacle was not so much reminiscent of rugby league as Australian Rules.</p> <p>The next few months threaten to be a trial, too, for referees. The law changes are intended to simplify the sport but they appeared to be giving the New Zealand-born Small a severe case of brain-ache. All too often he would be watching for some trifling ELV and miss a glaring example of ball-killing or a knock-on. Joe Worsley should have been sin-binned at the start of the second quarter when he cynically snuffed out a promising Irish attack and Wasps were denied a potential penalty try in the closing seconds when the otherwise outstanding Peter Hewat pulled Worsley back in a race for a bouncing ball. </p> <p>A losing bonus point, even so, would have been an injustice. \"There's no hiding the fact that was a sub-standard performance,\" said their director of rugby Ian McGeechan. There will be no such soul-searching for the Exiles, who have not lost in three outings as the \"home\" side on Twickenham double-header day. This result was no accident. Booth deliberately challenged Nick Kennedy and Steffon Armitage to outperform the incumbent England squad men Simon Shaw and Tom Rees. Both did so and the national coaching staff will also have noted the mature performance of Alex Corbisiero, an England Under-20 prop with Italian antecedents born in New York City.

  "<p>The European commission's population projections at the end of last month should result in calling time on the UK's open door immigration policy. It predicted that within 50 years Britain would become the most highly populated country in Europe. England is already about to overtake the Netherlands as the most densely populated country in the European Union. On the government's own figures, the population growth due to immigration by 2031 will require building something like seven new Birminghams. This is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>To highlight a much better alternative to this open door policy, Nicholas Soames and I are today announcing a cross-party group, Balanced Migration. Our central idea has the advantage of being both simple and workable. We propose cutting the link between economic migration and the virtually automatic right of workers from abroad to settle here permanently.</p> <p>Every poll emphasises how deeply concerned voters are about the rate of immigration and its impact on British society. Late in the day, both the government and the opposition are feeling their way towards a new policy. Neither party's approach has much prospect of controlling, let alone reducing, the number of newcomers who become permanent residents.</p> <p>The government claims it will control immigration through its new points system. By a subtle use of mirrors it suggests that this is based on the Australian model. What the government doesn't say, however, is that, unlike here, the Australian government starts by deciding the number of new citizens it believes it can be integrated.</p> <p>The Tory proposals are no better. Shadow ministers talk about a cap but fail to specify what they mean. Their approach is more than likely to result in another bureaucratic nightmare. Governments are not good at guessing the labour needs of the economy. </p> <p>What is new is our insistence both on cutting the link between economic migration and settlement and advocating that employers should be the drivers and the guardians of such arrangements. The proposals will, therefore, maintain competitiveness. </p> <p>Employers would have to advertise jobs, first locally and then throughout the EU - as they should now, but some plainly do not. For its part, the government would wish to ensure applicants' qualifications were genuine. These workers would then be admitted, but only for a maximum of four years. They would come to the UK on that clear understanding. Employers would have to produce evidence that workers had left at the end of their contracts. No departure, no approval for new contracts. </p> <p>Employers would, therefore, have a vested interest in policing the system properly. Our proposal would also minimise the cock-ups that any centrally directed approach invariably has in guessing future labour market demands. Not so long ago we saw health planners issuing contracts like sweets for overseas doctors when the first wave of extra \"home produced\" doctors was about to hit the labour market. Our group's objective is summed up in its name. The overall goal in the longer run would be to bring into balance the number of people coming into Britain to settle with the number who leave to live elsewhere in the world. </p> <p>Workers who have done well, and have proved their long-term worth to their company, and who did not wish to return home, would be free to bid for a place in a strictly limited annual quota set by the government in the light of the circumstances at the time. But there would be no automatic right to those places.</p> <p>Our approach does not, of course, solve all Britain's problems on the social cohesion front. But it does offer, for the first time, a real possibility of controlling the number of new citizens, thereby achieving a degree of population stability.</p> <p>The aims of our group fit in with the government's objective of seeking educational reforms that raise significantly the skill levels of young people coming into the labour market. Employers faced with our system would have, for the first time, a vested interest in increasing the skills of their own workforce and better-skilled school leavers. Above all, it would protect the position of low-paid workers who have borne the brunt of the recent influx into Britain. </p> <p>We are putting these ideas forward to start a debate. The onus is now on the political establishment to respond in a way that also meets the overwhelming demand of voters.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:fieldf@parliament.uk\">fieldf@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Steve Chalke, a Baptist minister with a motor mouth and bags of charm, is a very busy man. Six new academies run by his charity, Oasis, have just begun their first terms. Oasis already had three, and another three more are planned for next year. Opening one academy in Bristol late last week, Chalke explained, between bursts of loud cheering in the background, his idea of a faith school. Oasis often uses the same buildings, at least initially, as the local education authority did; it adopts the same admission policies and same staff; sometimes, all that Oasis adds to the school is \"membership of a global movement, Oasis, which is working to transform communities\", based on a vision that is \"person-centered, inclusive, servant-minded - we believe in redemption and transformation and that every person matters\". Everyone has to buy into the values, but not necessarily the belief in Jesus Christ, he adds.</p> <p>This is the kind of rhetoric that incenses critics of faith schools. Why is Andrew Adonis lavishing failing schools on a man with more experience of preaching than of teaching? The expansion of faith schools is a hard-hat area of education policy: you enter at your peril, to face a long-standing league of critics, now newly emboldened with a fashionable fear of Islam, and of religion more generally.</p> <p>So, with hard hat on, here goes the defence: that it is possible to justify faith schools within the state sector with important qualifications; that many of them do a remarkable job; and that it's time the critics put prejudice aside to think more carefully about the source of their appeal to parents.</p> <p>Ethos is the ghost in the machine in education. Everyone recognises it when they see it; parents want it; politicians regard it with awe, but how do you produce it? Most would agree that it's the result of a common set of values articulated by the head and shared by staff, governors, pupils and parents. Get that communal consensus motivated around high aspirations, mutual respect and self-discipline, and you have a successful, well-ordered school. </p> <p>But these are old-fashioned ideas. Walk into any secondary school and one senses how counter-cultural that ethos is. The blazers, badges, Latin mottos, the \"Morning, Sir,\" the emphasis on tradition, formality and obedience: it's an institutional culture decades old. Teachers have the unenviable task of battling against a culture of self-entitlement, individualism and self-promotion to try to generate a common purpose. </p> <p>This is where faith schools can have an advantage. They can fall back on a well-known, religious narrative to which there is still considerable adherence in some form. As the last census showed, over 70% of people in this country still describe themselves as Christian; that may not mean going to church but it may mean wanting children to grow up with broadly Christian values. For a faith school, the common values are familiar to all and easy to explain, and therein lies the possibility of a strong ethos.</p> <p>That is not to say that non-religious schools can't achieve this - of course they can, but it is harder. Secular ethical traditions are honourable but they lack the familiarity, the symbols, the narratives and histories that bring the abstract to emotional life. These issues of character formation have been the subject of two fascinating essays in recent issues of the magazine Prospect. Edward Skidelsky argues that both the secular and sacred \"languages\" underpinning the values of self-discipline and responsibility have been badly eroded. Secular humanism has not found a popular ethical narrative to replace faith; parents, uncertain how to bring up their children with a sense of responsibility for others, resort to school Christianity.</p> <p>Perhaps this is how faith schools have successfully sustained the buy-in of the middle class. It's part of what comprehensive education is about: all children from all backgrounds within a faith community so that the middle classes bring their commitment to education into the mix. This is precisely what so many failing schools have not got, while the middle classes desert the state system to take refuge in highly selective, expensive private schools. So why criticise a part of the system that works?</p> <p>In the vituperative debate on faith schools, a continuing programme of research from the London School of Economics has been used as ammunition by the critics, as it shows that faith schools have a lower proportion of children on free school meals. Critics accuse them of \"cherry-picking\" the more affluent pupils. But Sandra McNally, director of education and skills at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance, has also analysed the figures nationally and concludes that, although the average proportion of pupils on free meals in secondary schools is 12.9% for Catholic, 10.8% for other religious, and 14% for non-religious, we don't know whether this is evidence of faith schools choosing more affluent pupils or of a bigger proportion of their applicants coming from more affluent homes. The disparity is bigger at primary school level; is this because primary schools are cleverer at weeding out the poor or because many middle-class families start in the state sector even if they end up going private? We'll have to wait for more research to be sure, but I'll hazard a bet that it's the latter.</p> <p>But my support for faith schools is not unqualified, and this is where the Oasis academies are so intriguing. They do not discriminate on grounds of religious faith in staff employment or pupil admission. Chalke does not believe a school should be a holy huddle of the faithful. This radical innovation is what makes other faith schools very uneasy. The Catholic hierarchy successfully fought off quotas of non-believers recently; it is still locked in its ghetto history of tightly-knit migrant communities in hostile host societies. It has used employment discrimination and tight admissions as barricades to defend against \"dilution\" of the ethos.</p> <p>The outcome of this varies enormously across the country; in inner cities, Catholic schools absorb a disproportionate number of black African and Caribbean children - indeed, they are a vital educational resource for these groups. But in areas where the ethnic minority is Asian and Muslim, they can become a repository for white flight. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the record of sectarianism is dismal. Given that the new admissions code places a duty on faith schools to promote community cohesion, the Catholic church needs to interrogate much more closely the role its schools play in different areas.</p> <p>However, far worse forms of segregation blight British education: the residential segregation whereby Kingston upon Thames has 7.9% of pupils eligible for free meals while Tower Hamlets has 58.8%, with concomitant differences in educational achievement, and the even more pernicious cherry-picking routinely done by independent schools - half of which, as charities, are effectively subsidised by the taxpayer. </p> <p>I don't know whether Steve Chalke and Oasis can inject a new vision into their growing network of academies, but such is their drive, commitment and self-belief that I can see why any government - led by either Brown or Cameron - would be won over. Their idealism and sincerity - Oasis youth workers volunteer to live in the community to support the school - win sceptics over because there is a desperate dearth of alternative narratives of transformation in deprived communities with low levels of educational achievement.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On paper the Sharks had never had a better chance of winning here, which they had failed to do in 16 visits, and they very nearly blew it. </p> <p>With Jonny Wilkinson unfit, Newcastle gave a debut to the England Under-18 fly-half Rory Clegg, and the teenager's insistence on kicking away possession allowed the visitors to control the early stages. Dwayne Peel and Luke McAlister were prominent as Sale worked through a series of crossfield attacks, but Newcastle must still have been desperately disappointed at the ease with which Charlie Hodgson stepped inside Clegg and then around Tom May and Alex Tait to score. McAlister then kicked a penalty before, prompted by the No8 and captain Phil Dowson, the home pack began to get on terms. </p> <p>Clegg too began to settle, and though he and May missed drop goals, the young fly-half kicked two penalties to keep his team in touch. Mathew Tait, making his competitive debut for Sale, almost marked his return to his old club with a score in the corner, but May bundled him into touch a yard short. McAlister's second penalty then restored Sale's five-point lead. </p> <p>The Sharks were fortunate not to concede a penalty try early in the second half, when Hodgson failed to gather Alex Tait's kick and then appeared to trip Jamie Noon as the England centre was about to dribble the ball over the line. At the other end, McAlister kicked a penalty. </p> <p>Newcastle responded again, but though Clegg was now more prepared to bring his backs into the game, there was a predictability about the Falcons' moves. The game became scrappy, and May's break in midfield was taken to within five yards of the Sale posts by Noon. With the referee having signalled the penalty, Clegg slotted a drop goal. Even when the Sale flanker Luke Abraham was sent to the sin-bin, however, the Falcons did not look like making their numerical advantage count. </p> <p>\"We were well organised, did the basics well, and didn't make any mistakes that would have allowed Newcastle to punish us,\" said Sale's director of rugby, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9. </p> <p>His opposite number, Steve Bates, said: \"We absorbed a bit of pressure in the first half but in the second they didn't really create anything, whereas we had two or three opportunities.

  "<p>The game between Somerset and Durham starting at Taunton tomorrow could help determine the winner of an increasingly tense race for the County Championship after both sides had to make do with rain-affected draws at the weekend. Nottinghamshire lead Division One by four points from Somerset following the sides' weather-beaten stalemate at Trent Bridge, but while Notts have only two games left, both Somerset and fourth-placed Durham - neither of whom has ever won the trophy - have three.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire's own title aspirations received a further blow when it was confirmed yesterday that Surrey, their next opponents on September 17, are hoping to include the Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar in their attack. Turned away by Heathrow customs officials on Wednesday because of an incorrect visa, Shoaib was scheduled to arrive back this morning as Surrey aim to avoid relegation by winning their final two matches, starting tomorrow against Hampshire at the Oval.</p> <p>\"I thought after the debacle the other day Shoaib might just say 'that's it',\" said the Surrey coach, Alan Butcher. \"But he's gone straight back, got the visa and is hopping on a plane again. We hope that proves he has the motivation we need from him to help us over these very important last two matches.\"</p> <p>Shoaib said: \"The eventual aim is to play for Pakistan and I feel Surrey offers me the best opportunity to prove my fitness.\" Since his new county are 18 points adrift of Yorkshire and Lancashire at the bottom of the table he may have to fire immediately - and hope that his team-mates can buck their season's trend and hold their catches.</p> <p>\"It's our fault we're in this position,\" said Butcher. \"If we hadn't dropped 43 catches in the championship we wouldn't be where we are. It's in our hands, we hope. Or out of it, as the case has been so far.\" That was a rare moment of levity in a difficult year for winless Surrey, who were condemned by yesterday's draw with Kent at Canterbury to the worst season in their history - a statistic made slightly less painful by Mark Ramprakash's sixth hundred of the summer and his fourth in successive matches. But Ramprakash's declaration at 307 for nine simply paved the way for Rob Key, who finished with 76 not out from 68 deliveries, and Joe Denly, who hit a 60-ball 80, to thrash 159 in 21 overs as Kent moved third. Only bad light prevented the addition of a batting point.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Flintoff has echoed the views of his Lancashire captain, Stuart Law, by questioning the club's decision to release Dominic Cork at the end of the season. \"I think Lancashire should have kept him on,\" said Flintoff. \"The best thing that could happen is for someone to turn around and tell him we've made a mistake and keep him at Lancashire, but I'm not sure that is going to happen. I'm all in favour of bringing younger players on, but they have got to be good enough and have got to perform.\"</p> <p>Lancashire's relegation battle was not aided by the fact that bad weather at Chester-le-Street limited their match with Durham to just 95 overs, while Yorkshire's rain-ruined draw with Sussex at Scarborough meant Michael Vaughan did not get the chance to add to his first-innings 19.</p> <p>Worcestershire, who are almost certain of promotion from Division Two, are expected to announce today that they will play their final home matches of the season at Kidderminster after New Road was flooded when the River Severn burst its banks during last week's downpours. The club lost almost \u00a31m when their Worcester headquarters were rendered unplayable by last year's floods.</p>",
  "<p>David Young's DVD player is certain to get a bashing as he attempts to work out why the Blues did not begin the new Magners League campaign with a resounding victory against the defending champions.</p> <p>The coach will try to discover how his side's domination did not result in more points and to understand one or two rulings by the referee Andy Macpherson and his touch judges. \"It was definitely two points lost ... very few times do you play champions of a competition and dominate a game as much as we did,\" he said. \"I'm sure the Leinster coaches will be far more pleased with the result because, to be honest, they weren't in the game.\"</p> <p>The clash began controversially, with two incidents in the space of two minutes early in the opening half. First, the referee awarded a penalty to Leinster, converted by Felipe Contepomi, which should have been handed to the Blues for some stamping by Shane Jennings on Andy Powell. And secondly, Macpherson seemed to miss a prime candidate for a penalty try - Rob Kearney's deliberate knock-on preventing a try-scoring pass from Martyn Williams to Richard Mustoe.</p> <p>\"It should have been a penalty try,\" said Young, \"and if we had gone two scores in front it would have been end of sports.\" Cardiff dominated territory and possession as Leinster struggled to stop efficient gainline breaking from Powell, making the most of the experimental law variation at the scrum to set up the Blues try, Maama Molitika, Jamie Roberts, and Tom Shanklin. Though he sometimes struggled for control Nicky Robinson kicked well, and also produced two drop-goals. </p> <p>But after conceding a soft, equalising try when Mustoe failed to deal with Isa Nacewa's up and under, Robinson failed to go in search of a third drop-goal at the end. Everything seemed in his favour - uncontested scrums and good field position - but for some reason no attempt came.

  "<p>Five deaths, about 1,000 wrecked homes and swamped flood defences marked the latest wave of torrential storms to sweep across the country at the weekend, followed by warnings of another band of heavy weather late tomorrow. </p> <p>Lifeboat crews were sent 35 miles inland from the North Sea coast to help with hundreds of evacuations at Morpeth, Northumberland, while volunteers built sandbag walls round town centres in North Yorkshire as flash floods poured down from the North York Moors. </p> <p>Helicopters plucked several marooned families from rooftops and trees in Morpeth, where the Wansbeck reached its highest level for 40 years and turned the town into a lake. The Environment Agency said a prolonged drenching from slow-moving storm clouds gave the area a month's rain - up to 140mm - in a couple of hours. </p> <p>Filthy lines of brown sludge stretched along the High Street in Morpeth, and a similar tidemark showed how close a similar disaster had come to overwhelming the centre of Pickering, 10 miles inland from Scarborough. </p> <p>\"I had to run from the water, it came up that fast,\" said Tospy Clinch, 91, who only moved back into her cottage in Pickering in July, after a year of repairs following last summer's floods. \"We've got a system now; we have to have. My friends and neighbours had everything upstairs in 30 minutes.\" </p> <p>The water cut off her terrace all night on Saturday, but stopped feet from sandbags in front of the door yesterday morning. \"It's been a mercy this time - I was wondering what colour to choose for the sixth carpet I've had to lay here,\" she said. \"We need action. Our beck needs dredging, dredging, dredging.\" </p> <p>There were similar calls for urgency in Morpeth, where a consultation on better flood defences is not due to make recommendations until the spring.</p> <p>Jessica Leonard, 48, one of a score of people driven out of their houses in Wansbeck Place, said: \"Why isn't there any organisation? Floods aren't a new thing, so why weren't there any plans in place? We even had to buy our own sandbags.\" </p> <p>Computer models gave several hours' warning to the stricken area, as new rain gauges sent electronic signals to the Environment Agency's regional HQ that something out of the ordinary was under way. </p> <p>Asghar Akhoudi, an agency forecaster, said that buckets in the gauges were tipping and refilling in quick succession as the downpour approached, transmitting data each time. Rain levels were such that traditional fill-and-check gauges would probably have been overwhelmed. </p> <p>The storms claimed their fifth victim late yesterday, when the body of a 27-year-old technician was found beneath an avalanche of mud at a gas pipeline in the Cotswolds. Alex Wright was reported missing on Saturday when tonnes of soaked earth slid into the trench were he was working, but the whole area was too dangerous for fire and rescue crews to investigate until yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>Seven severe flood warnings remained in force last night, all in the north-east, where parts of central Durham and the commuter town of Ponteland, north of Newcastle, remained in danger along with four areas of Morpeth.</p> <p>The Met Office said scattered showers would continue today but most areas would have a respite, with spells of sunshine. Brighter weather had already returned to Pickering and Malton yesterday, with tourists watching the muddy waters of Pickering Beck and the Derwent sink back into their usual riverbeds. </p> <p>Occasional heavy downpours continued to hit eastern England between the Humber and the Scottish border. Rain caused by an Atlantic front moving in tomorrow was not expected to be anything like as severe as at the weekend, but could threaten flood defences in places where rivers are already swollen. </p> <p>The other victims of the storms were a 17-year-old girl who died when a 4x4 slid into a swollen stream in a forest in Powys, mid-Wales, a couple in Plymouth whose car hit a tree in torrential rain, and a motorcyclist from Sheffield who ploughed into a fallen tree branch on the A66 near Scotch Corner during a downpour. </p> <p>Properties evacuated as the front moved slowly north across the Midlands included a private brain injury unit in Sheffield, whose patients were transferred when water swamped the ground floor. </p> <p>Judy Evans, operations director of the British Red Cross for the north-east and Cumbria, said: \"The flood waters rose so quickly that we were not able to help with that evacuation because we couldn't get the vehicles in.\"</p> <p>The leader of Castle Morpeth council, Peter Jackson, said: \"The last major flooding in Morpeth happened in 1963 and we have extended our defences since then.\" </p> <p>But fears of what happened over the weekend prompted widespread local concern last summer, leading the Environment Agency to launch its Morpeth consultation. An agency statement last December warned that the town's defences \"need to be improved and extended to cope with today's level of flood risk and our changing climate\".</p>",
  "<p>Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are uniquely US institutions with no direct British equivalent. The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) buy mortgages from lenders, package them up and sell them on to financial institutions around the world as well as at home. They also lend directly to homeowners.</p> <p>They are in the strange position of being sponsored by the US government but owned by shareholders. Shareholders, though, will be forced to absorb the majority of the pain as a result of the government seizing control.</p> <p>Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, was created by President Franklin Roosevelt's government during the Great Depression of the 1930s to ensure sufficient funds could be made available to mortgage banks.</p> <p>In 1970, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, nicknamed Freddie Mac, was created to provide competition to Fannie Mae.</p> <p>Between them they stand behind three quarters of all new mortgages lent in the US and own or guarantee $4.8tn (\u00a32.7tn) of US mortgages. But they have had combined losses of more than $14bn over the past year as increasing numbers of homeowners defaulted on their loans. They also have a combined debt of $1.4tn.</p> <p>In July, Congress passed a bill that would allow the US treasury to lend money or buy shares in the organisations to keep them afloat. It also set up the Federal Housing Finance Agency to regulate the two institutions and it is this body that will run the two companies on the government's behalf.</p> <p>Questions have long been asked as to the purpose of the two GSEs in a modern world of large and deep capital markets, especially as few other countries have such institutions. But Freddie and Fannie have been so big for so long that they have been able to employ the top lobbyists in Washington to argue for their continued existence and privileges.</p> <p>Discussion may turn to what shape the two institutions should take when they emerge, which Paulson said he hoped would be after one year, from the current \"conservatorship\". But just as the UK wants Northern Rock to emerge after three years, the US authorities may find it more difficult to return Freddie and Fannie to the private sector than they think.</p>",
  "<p>The three generations of the Osborne family who spent their summer holiday together last month presented a lively sight. Sir Peter Osborne, the 17th baronet in a line stretching back to the reign of Charles I in 1629, found himself with a ringside seat as his wife and heir locked horns over the issue that has divided families across the world.</p> <p>The subject of the war in Iraq disrupted the family holiday when Osborne's son, George, mounted a passionate defence of the war in the face of strong opposition from his mother.</p> <p>\"I still have rows with my mother about the Iraq war,\" Osborne says. Felicity Loxton-Peacock, noted debutante, anti-Vietnam war protester and former deli owner, feels particularly strongly on the war from her experience as an Amnesty International desk officer, he adds. \"Her area was the Kurds, dealing with the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime - a point I make to her when we discuss the Iraq war.\" The Osborne family row shows that the man who is certain to be chancellor if David Cameron's Conservatives win the next election is cut from a different cloth from traditional grand Tories. His family are multimillionaires - his father founded the successful wallpaper firm Osborne &amp; Little - but there was no hunting, shooting and fishing, and his parents voted Labour until the arrival of Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>\"I came from a privileged background and I went to a very good school, St Paul's,\" Osborne, 37, tells the Guardian in an interview in his Commons office overlooking the Thames. \"But it was a very cosmopolitan and metropolitan upbringing. I was brought up in the centre of London and that was my world. It's not a life of sort of landed estates. My parents' set of friends operate in the interior design world, so they are journalists, writers and art dealers.\" His metropolitan background provides an intriguing backdrop to a relationship that may well shape Britain for the next decade. </p> <p>He talks openly of how his upbringing contrasts with the landed country background of David Cameron, the son of a stockbroker who grew up in Oxfordshire. \"There are differences and we had different upbringings,\" he says.</p> <p>The contrasts between the two are being picked over by opponents who hope they will follow the example of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, whose relations slowly became poisoned. Osborne and Cameron do have disagreements; as a passionate Atlanticist, the shadow chancellor still stands by his decision to vote for the Iraq war in 2003, while the Tory leader is racked by doubts over his yes vote.</p> <p>Osborne tells the Guardian that the Tories' introduction of section 28, the law banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools, was \"antediluvian\". Cameron took some time to come round to this view and voted for its retention as late as 2003. The two also voted on opposite sides in a divisive Commons vote in May. </p> <p>Osborne voted on liberal lines on abortion and on allowing lesbian couples to have IVF treatment. Cameron voted to cut the upper limit on abortion from 24 to 20 weeks and to make IVF clinics consider the \"need for a father and a mother\" before allowing women to begin fertility treatment. \"I am a social liberal, but I do approach these issues on their merits,\" Osborne says.</p> <p>There were suggestions recently that Osborne felt uneasy about Cameron's pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system. He rejects this, saying: \"We will recognise marriage in the tax system.\"</p> <p>He adds that he considers it the best environment for raising children, but makes it clear that unmarried parents will not lose out: \"I hope a Conservative government will be able to offer things for everyone.\" Sharing the same view as Cameron on marriage, according to </p> <p>Osborne, is an example of how they agree on the \"big things\", as he rejects comparisons with Blair and Brown. </p> <p><strong>Friendship with Cameron</strong></p> <p>\"My relationship with David Cameron first of all is built on personal friendship - we are godparents to each other's children,\" he says. \"I didn't want the job [of party leader]. That is the biggest obvious difference [with Blair and Brown].\" The friendship was cemented last year when they held their nerve in the face of Gordon Brown's popularity \"bounce\" after he succeeded Tony Blair. </p> <p>Amid speculation that Cameron could be ousted if he lost a snap election, the pair planned a series of measures unveiled at the last Conservative conference. They proved so popular that Brown abandoned his election plan.</p> <p>They hope to maintain that spirit by showing the Tories offer more than catchy slogans, such as \"Vote Blue Go Green\", and that they too are prepared for the consequences of a prolonged economic downturn. Osborne jokes that he has had a personal taste of the changing economic climate. \"I have the remortgage papers on my desk,\" he says. \"The mortgage costs have gone up, not the actual mortgage.\"</p> <p>The state of the economy prompts him to sympathise with the current chancellor. \"I had some sympathy that Alistair Darling was trying to tell the truth,\" he says of the chancellor's remarks in the Guardian that Britain and the world were facing \"arguably the worst\" economic conditions in 60 years. \"Nevertheless he's the chancellor, and he needs to command public confidence in his ability to manage economic policy. \"I don't think he commands public confidence at the moment.\"</p> <p>These remarks show how Osborne plans to use the parlous state of the economy to pile pressure on the government, and to assess his economic plans with care. Describing how Britain's large budget deficit has placed a \"straitjacket\" round the economy, he says: \"One of the things we are very conscious of is that we are probably going to inherit a complete economic mess ... I think we will be shocked by the state of the books when we get there.\"</p> <p>The Tories are drawing up a new \"fiscal framework\", he says - rules governing how the government raises and spends money. If they are well received, they may answer one of the main criticisms levelled at him: that his instinct is to go for the political jugular in the short term without thinking through the political consequences.</p> <p>For example, it is widely accepted in Tory circles that Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, made a better fist of the Northern Rock crisis by campaigning for what became inevitable: its nationalisation. Osborne opposed this from the outset, so that he could portray such a move as a return by Labour to its socialist roots. </p> <p>Osborne says he accepts that the downturn has consequences for the Tories. \"That obviously forces us to think very hard about the difficult decisions we're going to have to take as an incoming government,\" he says.</p> <p>This more cautious approach is likely to prompt complaints from Tory rightwingers who want immediate tax cuts. Osborne dismisses what he has called their \"siren\" calls as he pledges to follow the path of their heroine, who took eight years to reduce the share of national income taken by the state to below the level she inherited. \"Margaret Thatcher wrestled with very difficult decisions and she was much more flexible and realistic than is sometimes portrayed,\" he says. But there will be no slashing of public spending. \"The Tory party is not there to impose impossible public expenditure cuts in an economic downturn: that's not what we believe in.\" The Conservatives now regard themselves as the greatest champions of progressive politics in Britain. Highlighting the depth of the change in their thinking, Osborne says it is right to tackle \"relative poverty\", how people's wealth relates to the average, rather than concentrating just on \"absolute poverty\", simply providing a safety net to catch the poorest.</p> <p><strong>Helping the underclass</strong></p> <p>\"I don't think it makes for a happy or strong society to know there are people so much poorer than your kind of average middle class, that there is an underclass. Whilst they may not be without food, without shelter - the classic kind of Victorian definitions of poverty - they are so lacking in opportunity and aspiration that it is a scar on society. I think the real job is to raise their opportunities and aspirations, and worry less about the hedge fund manager or the premier league footballer. That's the great challenge of our age.\"</p> <p>Osborne uses poverty to make a wider point - that he thinks the Tories are better placed to tackle issues normally associated with Labour. \"Gordon Brown thought the answer was to give people more money. We would argue the causes of poverty are much more complicated than that. It is about family breakdown, failing schools, poor healthcare, and lack of opportunity. This claim we make, that progressive goals are best achieved now by Conservative means, is something we are quite proud of.\"</p> <p>Osborne talks of one of the most important goals at the heart of the Cameron project: to speed up the Blairite process of giving the private sector, charities and voluntary groups greater involvement in delivering public services. \"You get a level of innovation that is lacking in very large public bureaucracies,\" he says. \"Sometimes in public sector organisations you're more concerned that you properly account for how money is spent, rather than whether the money is actually effective, whereas a private or voluntary sector organisation will be concerned with the outcome and the result.\"</p> <p>He believes that the Tories have the armoury to protect themselves against the sort of Brown onslaught that destroyed William Hague in 2001. Osborne should know: he was Hague's political secretary at the time. </p> <p>\"We sat in a little office, we could tell you about poll leads. At one point the government had a 40% poll lead. So I don't know what Gordon Brown is complaining about,\" he says. Labour were 15 points behind the Tories in the most recent Guardian/ICM poll. At this moment, Osborne looks at his most prized memento: a fake Newcastle Brown ale with the label \"Bottler Brown\", mocking his decision last autumn not to hold an election.</p>",
  "<h2>Magazines</h2> <p><strong>Journal glosses over</strong></p> <p>With a sudden blast of guitar rock, the Wall Street Journal last week unveiled WSJ., a new glossy supplement that serves as Rupert Murdoch's first significant addition to the brand since his purchase of Dow Jones last year.</p> <p>Assembled at the Pierpont Morgan library, the gathering of senior executives, including Robert Thomson, managing editor of the Journal, and WSJ.'s editor, Tina Gaudoin, a transfer from the Times in London, said the magazine was designed to broaden both the readership and revenue of America's biggest-selling newspaper. A direct competitor to the FT's How To Spend It and the New York Times style magazine, T, the glossy is expected to have a US circulation of 2m and a foreign distribution in Europe and Asia of 160,000 copies. </p> <p>Thomson suggested at the launch that he has brought the more competitive atmosphere of British newspapers to New York when he said there \"would be no fetid air of failure\" at his magazine. With the wealthiest readership of any US newspaper - an average household income of $265,000 and assets of nearly $3m - the magazine promises, says Gaudoin, \"to respect its audiences' respect of money\".</p> <p>In the debut issue, the main subject is Shawn Askinosie, a former criminal defence lawyer turned chocolate maker. There's also a story about the work-out routine of the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>As with any luxury-attuned style supplement, the features are comprehensively tailored to attract luxury-brand advertising. The Journal's readers spend an average of 16 days a year sailing, for instance - a bizarre statistic that presumably inspired a feature about the Oracle chairman, Larry Ellison, and Swiss biotech heir Ernesto Bertarelli arguing in court over their racing yachts' hulls.</p> <p>Michael Rooney, chief revenue officer of Dow Jones, dismissed rumours that the paper had considered postponing the launch of the magazine due to the poor advertising climate. \"It will contribute to the bottom line,\" he predicted, \"because there is flight to quality in difficult times.\"<br><strong>Edward Helmore</strong></p> <h2>Law</h2> <p><strong>Chat is 'mere abuse'</strong></p> <p>A legal judgment could help editors who are nervous about potentially libellous material being posted on their website forums. According to Mr Justice Eady \"comments on online bulletin boards are more like slander than libel\" .</p> <p>The judge was making his remarks last month in a case where the chairman of a shareholder action group had been accused on a bulletin board of \"bully-boy tactics\". Eady ordered a stay on a number of libel actions brought by the chairman, and said many comments would have a defence in slander as \"mere vulgar abuse\". </p> <p>Many publications seem to have adopted one of two approaches to moderating online reader contributions: an ultra-cautious, pre-moderation approach, where every post is vetted before it is allowed up on to the website, with obvious drawbacks in terms of staffing and the delay this builds into the forum; or a \"see-no-evil\" policy, allowing content to be posted unmoderated, and removing it only if a complaint is received. This approach goes contrary to practices in print publication.</p> <p>In his judgment, Eady said there was a difference between the permanence of print publication and online discussion. \"From the context of casual conversations, one can often tell that a remark is not to be taken literally or seriously and is rather to be construed merely as abuse,\" he said. \"That is less common in the case of more permanent written communication. In the case of a bulletin board thread it is often obvious people are just reacting in the heat of the moment. The remarks are often not intended, or to be taken, as serious.\"</p> <p>Whether Eady's remarks are applied to newspaper sites, where readers are often \"invited\" to comment on stories, will depend on how case law develops - but they would mark a distinct liberalisation of defamation law.</p> <p>A claimant in an action for slander, unlike libel, has to prove that there has been some loss as a result, making it a more difficult action to pursue.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>David Banks</strong> is co-author of McNae's Essential Law for Journalists and teaches media law at the University of Sunderland</p> <h2>Television</h2> <p><strong>Call of independence</strong></p> <p>An independent commission on Scottish broadcasting will today call for an entirely Scottish television channel and a dedicated national news programme to compete head-on with the BBC's and ITN's evening news bulletin - the so-called \"Scottish Six\".</p> <p>Exactly 13 months after it began work, the Scottish Broadcasting Commission will unveil proposals for initiatives in TV, programme-making and digital media.</p> <p>The announcement comes ahead of a visit by the BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, to Edinburgh, in which he will launch a new Gaelic language digital channel costing \u00a320m - the first stage towards what may eventually become a far more decentralised BBC service. </p> <p>Both proposals from the Scottish Broadcasting Commission have powerful supporters. Its architect, Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond, has long resented the BBC's perceived London-centric bias, and has championed the case for a Scottish Six. Meanwhile, the SMG chief executive, Rob Woodward, has campaigned for a dedicated Scottish digital channel - labelled as Scottish Gold - to be created in partnership with the BBC.</p> <p>But a close observer of the commission's work anticipates it will fail to support Salmond's aspiration for the Scottish Six to be hosted on BBC1, and it will also suggest the new channel should first run on iPlayer-type services. </p> <p>This halfway house, says Robert Beveridge, a lecturer at Napier University and a member of the BBC's Scottish audience council, resulted from a combination of uncertainty about the financial case for the \u00a315m channel proposed by Woodward and a desire to prepare the TV sector for digital convergence. </p> <p>The commission will also agree with the BBC that it should be available only to those who want it - not forced on every viewer in Scotland.<br><strong>Severin Carrell and Kate Smith</strong></p>",
  "<p>Hanna Segal opens the door at the second ring. She turned 90 two days previously and is small, creased and walnut-brown, with a crop of startling white hair and a pair of eyes that look suitably gimlet-like but are, she observes dispassionately, not much use to anyone these days. </p> <p>\"Like the rest of me, really,\" she adds. </p> <p>\"I haven't been analysed myself for a couple of years now, but I would love some help in coping with a body that's started to behave as if it were a psychotic infant. It's like some narcissistic baby. Nothing is good enough for it. Nothing is ever quite right.\" </p> <p>Segal is one of the most eminent psychoanalysts ever to have practised in Britain. Splendidly, despite living in this country for nearly 70 years, she speaks English with a great, gutteral mittel-European accent. Even better, while she has been forced to abandon her beloved pipe, every few minutes she takes a small wad of tobacco from a tin at her elbow, pops it surreptitiously into her mouth, and chews. Who does that, these days? It is impossible not to warm to her. </p> <p>Hers is rather a strange profession, though. All that poking around in the dark, walled-off corners of people's minds, hunting down explanations for bizarre adult behaviour in obscure childhood events that invariably involve breasts or toilets. A lot of people have no time for it. </p> <p>Segal, obviously, does. \"The more I think about it,\" she says, \"the importance lies in seeking truth. Not 'The Truth' with a capital T, an omniscience, but truth that is the same as reality. All we are really looking for, in a patient on the couch, is a distinction between lies and truth.\"</p> <p>She no longer has a couch in her study, although the room, on the ground floor of large house in north London, is suitably sombre and book-lined. She stopped seeing individual patients a couple of years ago, although she still supervises major cases, from all over the world, by telephone. </p> <p>But the kind of people who came to see her were, she says, generally those who \"seek to avoid truth, and so end up in delusion. What you are aiming to achieve is a change in the direction of the mind, a bend towards truth. And while all science aims at truth, psychoanalysis is unique in recognising that the search for truth is, in itself, therapeutic.\"</p> <p>The latter phrase is one penned by Segal and colleagues for the obituary of Melanie Klein, of whose work Segal is pretty much universally recognised as the most prominent postwar interpreter. Kleinian psychoanalysis is one of the two main schools within the British Psychoanalytical Society, the other being Freudian (after Anna, Sigmund's daughter). </p> <p>The nuances between the two are not immediately apparent to the layperson, but if you ask Segal why, many years ago, she opted for the former rather than the latter, she answers that Freud's masterwork, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence, read \"like a textbook. It didn't speak to my imagination at all.\" Klein's Psychoanalysis of Children, on the other hand, \"was a revelation. It opened up a whole new world.\"</p> <p>Segal read both books on the advice of the distinguished Edinburgh psychoanalyst Ronald Fairbairn, just after the outbreak of the second world war, in Edinburgh. She had fled there from Paris, where her parents were then living and where she had grudgingly decided to complete the third year of her medical studies. The Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 had made it impossible to finish her degree at the University of Warsaw.</p> <p>\"I wanted to get back, desperately, with some of my friends, to help fight the invader. But I couldn't; there were just no more trains. So more by luck than reason, really, I survived. If ever I had managed to get back I certainly wouldn't be here today.\"</p> <p>Segal was born into a well-to-do Jewish family in August 1918 in Lodz: \"Poland's equivalent of Manchester. A horrible, industrial place. Ugh.\" Her father was a successful lawyer, although when she was 12 or 13 the family moved with him to Geneva, where he had taken a job editing one of the publications of the League of Nations. The international school she found herself in was an eye-opener. \"It did me a power of good. I'd been brought up deeply patriotic, but there I learned that Poland was not the centre of the universe. Thanks to that school, I have no particular religious tradition that alters or moulds my view of the world. All that was knocked out of me. It was immensely formative, terribly important.\"</p> <p>It was in Geneva that Segal first read the works of Sigmund Freud. \"I read Proust first, before Freud,\" she says. \"And I think I simply realised that there was nothing, absolutely nothing, more fascinating than human nature. And human relations.\"</p> <p>So when the time came to choose a career, psychoanalysis was almost a natural choice. It satisfied her interest in human nature, assuaged a powerful social conscience (\"I have to feel I am doing something useful. Something that might help people\"), and allowed her to explore the third great passion in her life: art. Segal's major contribution to the world of psychoanalysis is most probably in aesthetics and what is known as symbolisation. Two of her best-known books are entitled Dream, Phantasy and Art, and Delusion and Artistic Creativity.</p> <p>\"We cope with our anxieties and desires,\" she explains, \"in symbolical ways. We all need a capacity for symbol formation, or symbolisation: hopefully, we will try to find someone like our mother to marry, rather than try actually to marry our mother. Artists exist on the borderline of severe psychotic anxieties: if they succeed in symbolising them, then they can produce great art - but if not, they can be in trouble.\" </p> <p>Segal indicates a painting on the wall of a rather chaotic vase of flowers, all violent purples, magentas and reds. \"Look closer,\" she says. \"Can you see the face of a dog?\" It's there, sort of; a gloomy bloodhound, all drooping jowls and sad, tortured eyes. \"The work of a patient,\" she says. \"Saved him from madness.\"</p> <p>I must look dubious, because she comes back at me with Van Gogh, whose story you really can't argue with. She cites another case that, in many ways, first opened her to the possibilities of psychoanalysis: many years ago, on an evacuation train before the war, a girl had a schizophrenic fit, screaming what sounded like hysterical nonsense. </p> <p>\"She kept shouting, 'I shat my lover in the loo! I shat my lover in the loo!'\" Segal says. \"Later, after I read Klein, I realised that girl's words actually had a very obvious meaning; you could understand them. She was the one being evacuated, but in her mind she had reversed that situation: she was the one doing the evacuating. This, I understood, was the language of subconscious fantasy.\"</p> <p>I'm still dubious. How can psychoanalysts ever really know they're right? \"We can't,\" she says. \"There's no quick cure or absolute certainty. And the truth rarely stays the truth; yesterday's truth is not today's. But there is a sense of accumulating evidence. You mustn't concentrate, or try to remember - but in the mass of patient communication, you have to select the right fact, with an open mind. And you have to be sure that fact is not just your idea, your own, overrated idea. It's not easy.\"</p> <p>Segal has been president of the British Psychoanalytical Society, Freud Professor of Psychoanalysis at the University of London, and vice-president of the International Psychoanalytical Association. For a long time she steered clear of sociopolitical issues, until in 1983 she co-founded a pressure group called Psychoanalysts for the Prevention of Nuclear War. She is now outspoken about a range of issues, including 9/11 and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. \"We're always told not to treat society as if it were a patient on the couch,\" she says, \"but group psychology can be understood because it is a group of humans.\"</p> <p>The function of a group, she contends, is certainly to work together, but also to act as a kind of repository for our projections of all those bad things we cannot tolerate in ourselves. \"Groups contain our psychotic anxieties and delusions,\" she says (and has argued, in a quite remarkable paper entitled September 11). </p> <p>\"Generally, we delegate what you might call the 'mad' functions - fighting, religion - to subgroups: the army, the church. But those subgroups must be under the control of the working part of the group. My point is that when mad things start happening, it's when subgroups get out of control, and particularly when they combine: God, money and the military is a particularly deadly recipe.\" The Iraq conflict, she argues, was about \"the need for an enemy\", and \"a religious fanaticism linked to, and covering up, mass robbery\". </p> <p>Today, Segal believes, our collective sanity is threatened by \"a delusional inner world of omnipotence, and absolute evil, and sainthood. Unfortunately, we also have to contend with mammon.\" And since we tend to submit to the tyranny of our own groups, \"speaking our minds takes courage, because groups do not like outspoken dissenters.\" The battle now \"is between insanity based on mutual projections, and sanity based on truth\". And all we, as citizens, can do is \"struggle to expose lies, and strive for the preservation of sane human values\". </p> <p>She is not convinced she will ever see that battle resolved (\"This is my last interview,\" she says gaily. \"You'd better do a good job.\") But the important thing, she insists, adopting the vivid symbol she first found in Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic fable The Road, is to \"keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden. I find this extraordinarily helpful: we live in a mad world, but for those of us who believe in some human values, it is terribly important that we just keep this little fire burning. It is about trusting your judgement, and the power of love. A little trust, and a little care\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</strong>, a collection of writings by Hanna Segal, is published by Routledge (\u00a321.99).</p>",
  "<p>When I was 19, I moved to the US to work at the New York Botanical Garden. I had never lived in a city before, having grown up in Hampshire surrounded by farms, woods and wild places. I was at once entranced and terrified. After what, at the time, I considered a dull country upbringing, the city pulsed with excitement. Yet I could not quite accept that I would not have a green place of my own there. One day I was looking out onto endless fields; the next I was living in a place where having anything other than a brick wall outside your window seemed to be a luxury. </p> <p>I really searched that city for somewhere to live. I was offered rooms with no natural light, rooms in basements, and one rather odd division of some starving actor's pad where the owner partitioned the room by hanging up a sheet. I remember getting excited that one place had a deep window ledge. </p> <p>When I had almost given up, I wandered into a neighbourhood where every second block seemed to be a garden. I didn't really know where I was, but I knew I had to stay. I rented a room from a friendly hippy with a top-floor view over all these lovely gardens. One of them was to become my home for that year. I had found a community that was making beautiful gardens literally from the street. The paths, the compost, the arbours, every inch was judiciously recycled from other people's waste. The only money these East Side gardens received was from yard sales and the odd grant to fund a fence to keep them safe. </p> <p>I have spent many years in formal training as a horticulturalist, at the Royal Horticultural Society and Kew, as well as the New York Botanical Garden. Yet that period at the East Side gardens was at least as influential. I fell in love with the ethic, thrift and spirit that thrive in such settings. And I learned how to \"scrap craft\" with great effect. </p> <p>Scrap craft is when you reuse or recycle unwanted items into something useful. It starts with \"I wonder if I ... \" and ends with all sorts of cool stuff for the garden. Floorboards turn into compost bins, a chest of drawers becomes your new container garden and someone's unwanted furniture your new patio table. I have lost count of the lidless plastic storage boxes I have seen in skips. Grab one, drill some holes in the bottom, fill it with compost and you have a perfect container in which to grow lettuce or radishes. I am not suggesting that a storage box is an attractive option, but I guarantee that once it is full of lettuce you won't be looking at the container. If you are really offended by the box, keep an eye out for an old bamboo blind - they are also forever being chucked into skips. With a little snipping you can wrap your box, sow some spicy greens and suddenly have a stylish container with a nod to Japan. </p> <p>Buckets, tubs and food containers can also all be used. I have a lovely old tin bath in which I grew my tomatoes this year and it is now housing my kale for the winter. Even hard landscaping doesn't need to be expensive: the most beautiful path I know is in that community garden in New York. Its intricate design is made up from fragments of the bricks found in the soil, testament that something as unpromising as rubble can still become part of a beautiful feature. </p> <p>Gardening is increasingly becoming something you buy, rather than something you do, yet there is nothing more satisfying than being able to say, \"I made that. \" You start to surround yourself with stuff that suits your home and the way you live and instead of the impersonal elegance or, worse still, mass ugliness of manufactured things, you get something that has a little bit of the spirit and personality of its maker. </p> <p>As I learned in New York, plants themselves can be free. I am now very good at doing a little judicious harvesting from front gardens as I walk to the supermarket. A seed head here or there has meant my garden has a growing opium poppy and verbena population. I am one for pretty weeds such as Welsh poppies, nettle-leaved bellflowers and hawkbits, and have carefully collected seed from the wilder, more neglected bits of my neighbourhood and sprinkled them around my garden. By maintaining the local population of wildflowers, I'm doing my bit for the wider environment too. </p> <p>If you keep your eyes peeled, you will even find adult plants. I have two lovely little cacti that I found last year discarded in a skip. With new pots and some fresh soil, they have grown well. I can't tell you what a kick I get every time I see them. </p> <p>Many of the community gardens that inspired me have now been lost to gentrification, but those that remain demonstrate that you don't need money to make a beautiful garden. That is the lesson to remember: whatever you end up creating and growing, find your own way of doing it, and enjoy the process. These days my working life is spent in Gardeners' World's beautiful garden near Stratford-upon-Avon, but my biggest pleasure is still coming home to my city garden and picking a salad from a wine crate full of compost I made from my kitchen waste. </p> <p>Here are some easy ways to become a more thrifty gardener.</p> <h2>Think outside the pot </h2> <p>It is hard to make a jumble of plastic pots look stylish, but there are all sorts of other things you can use to grow plants in. It is best to be either restrained and minimalist or eccentrically eclectic: you could use just one type of container or go for everything and anything that will house a plant, as long as you have flair and a good eye - no old boots or loo basins! </p> <p>Wooden wine boxes, with their lovely embossed logos, are great for growing salad crops in. The best place to get them from is a high-end wine merchants as the better the wine, the better the quality of box. Portuguese port boxes are usually really well made. It is a good idea to add corner braces to stop the wood from warping. You also need to drill holes in the base for drainage. Radishes, cut-and-come-again lettuces, spring onions, Oriental greens, tomatoes and herbs will all grow happily in boxes. </p> <p>Old drawers are another good resource. These tend to be made from very good wood, with lovely dovetailed joints. You will need to weatherproof them and create drainage holes; you should also line the drawers with plastic because they were never meant to be used outside, and brace the corners. Big drawers of around 20-30cm deep are the best find as you can grow roots such as beetroot, turnips, swedes or an entire salad crop in one box. </p> <p>A word about skip etiquette, as this is where you can find many of your raw materials. It is a fact that people are throwing stuff out and therefore don't want it, but they still have legal rights to it. So always ask permission before you raid a skip, for two reasons: it is polite and it keeps you on the right side of the law. Also, once people know what you are up to, they may even save you stuff. If you can't find anyone to ask permission from, leave a note. I've found it works wonders just to leave a note asking: \"Is this wood being thrown out and can I have it? Tick Yes or No.\" Some people swear by taking things from skips only at night or in the early morning, mainly because they are less likely to run into anyone, but I reckon this looks suspicious. I dive in at any time of day, I always leave the skip tidier than when I found it and I have yet to get into trouble.</p> <p>All wooden containers need preserving. Oil waterproofs the wood while still allowing it to breathe, so if the wood gets wet it can dry out. I use Danish oil, which is a blend of various oils that dry to form a hard surface. You will need at least three coats and it is not worth cutting corners because the more layers you treat it with, the longer the wood will last. A cheaper option is boiled linseed oil, but this takes more than a week to dry properly and can have a sticky finish - I have found that it works well on wine boxes, as this wood is so dry that it just sucks it in, but it is no good on pre-treated wood. </p> <p>Don't be tempted to varnish your boxes, as this will only result in more work. Varnish creates an impervious layer that physically keeps water out, but if there is any sort of crack then water gets in but can't get out, and the wood rots from the inside. </p> <p>Large food tins also make brilliant growing containers. Among my favourites are the big square ones that contained bulk-cured olives and have lovely designs on the front. You may be able to get hold of them from a market stall that sells Italian or Greek delicacies. Or try asking restaurants for ghee or oil tins. You will have to cut the top off them and, inevitably, they will rust, but that can be a good look. For the best drainage, drill holes around the sides near the bottom, rather than through the base. </p> <p>Potatoes grow so easily in containers that I have almost given up growing them in the ground. I bought five very large pots (the size of dustbins, themselves another alternative) from a pound store a couple of years ago and grow a summer supply with virtually no effort. Spuds will grow equally as well in old compost or mulch bags. These can be disguised with hessian sacks. Some of the nicest are seed potato bags, so ask your garden centre if it has any when you buy your potatoes in spring. Another source of sacks are pet stores, which may get bulk supplies of peanuts in them. </p> <p>As for plastic bags, you can grow almost anything in them, as long as they are not see-through (because roots don't like light). I have seen vegetables and flowering plants successfully grown in supermarket carriers. It may not be attractive, but if you know that you are only renting a flat for six months or so and don't want the hassle of transporting pots, it is one way to have a garden. </p> <h2>Grow your own compost</h2> <p>There are two myths that seem to stop people becoming master composters. Myth number one is that compost smells bad. This is emphatically not true. Good compost smells rich and healthy. Myth number two is that good compost takes years to make. Rubbish. Good compost can be made in around four months in the summer; over the winter it will take up to twice that long. </p> <p>Making compost is just like baking a cake or making bread. You have to put in the right ingredients and mix them together in vaguely the right amounts. If you put only grass clippings in your pile, it won't rot down for a very long time but will just turn into a slimy green mess. If all you try to compost are great chunks of branches or roots, these will take years to rot down. The key is to create a balance between the brown stuff you put in, and the green stuff - otherwise known as the carbon/nitrogen ratio. You should have about two-thirds brown stuff (carbon source) to one-third green (nitrogen). Brown broadly represents carbon found in fibrous material such as twigs and stems, straw, cardboard and roots, as well as old cotton and woollen clothes. Green refers to nitrogen found in plant leaves, stems, grass, flowers and weeds. </p> <p>The other thing you need to remember is to separate the annual weeds from the perennials. Fragments of root from perennials such as bindweed, mare's tail, docks, thistles, yellow-rooted nettles and couch grass will survive even the hottest compost, so you can't put them on your heap as soon as you have pulled them from the ground. Instead, soak them in a bucket of water with a lid (excluding light makes them decompose quicker). When it has turned into a slimy mass, put this onto the compost as a nutrient-rich soup.</p> <p>So: chop up your branches, throw on all your vegetable scraps and annual weeds, add a few thin layers of grass clippings (never more than 15cm/6in deep). Hurl on a pizza box, rip up your old jeans, add some plant prunings, and mix. That's all there is to it. You will end up with a delicious rich dark crumbly cake. All you have to do is spread this across the top of your garden and the worms will dig it in for you. The sum total of your expenditure will have been to walk to your compost bin a few times a week with vegetable scraps, to turn your compost once or twice and then to spread it. </p> <p>Why will a bin help? Compost ingredients are chiefly broken down by aerobic bacteria. To do this quickly and efficiently, they need plenty of air and moisture. The faster the bacteria work, the hotter the conditions get. Cooking the compost is fairly essential as it kills off weed seeds, pathogens and plant diseases. A large compost heap, anything a metre wide or more, will easily reach 60-70C in a matter of hours. A small pile will bake much more gently and perhaps never reach quite the same temperature. However, you can help the bacteria by having some sort of container for your compost, to insulate the pile and provide the right conditions for the \"bacterial bonfire\". </p> <p>Think of building your compost a little like a bonfire. Air needs to be drawn from the bottom up through the centre of the heap to get the fire going. One way to do this, particularly if your bin is plastic, is to lay several bricks on their edges at the bottom of the bin. This creates a layer on which the compost will sit, drawing air from below. It's always a good idea to have a lid for your bin to keep the rain out and the heat in, but make sure that it lets air through. If it's a plastic lid, make some small holes in it to draw air out. </p> <p>Compost also needs moisture. If it is too dry, the compost will virtually stand still, but if it is too wet, especially if this is coupled with too little air, you will get anaerobic conditions and the pile will start to produce methane. This is a big no-no, since the planet doesn't need any more. If you use a plastic bin, you will have to be especially careful not to create these conditions or you will get a slimy, rotting, very smelly mess. </p> <p>If you get into composting in a big way, you don't have to be limited by your own biodegradable waste. You can find lots of places to get waste for free - people will even be pleased for you to take it away. Most coffee shops have loads of used grounds that they chuck away - these are perfect compost material. Pet shops that sell birds have lots of droppings and nothing to do with them (but steer clear of cat and dog poo). Local pubs and restaurants will have vegetable scraps, and work canteens will be pleased for you to take home their used teabags. You may have to provide containers and promise regular collection, but it's worth it. </p> <h2>Use your windowsills</h2> <p>If you only have a very narrow, sunbaked windowsill and little inclination to water all the time, but you still want to look out on flowers, the lowest-maintenance display of all comes from shallow-rooting sedums or sempervivums (houseleeks). These are mountainous plants adapted to grow in very shallow, very poor soil, under extreme conditions from searing heat to bitter cold. They are usually to be found in the alpine section of the garden centre. </p> <p>The easiest way is to grow them in engineering bricks - the kind with holes in them. Gather together enough bricks to fill your sill and pack half of each hole with a mix of two parts good multipurpose compost to one part grit or vermiculite. This is a bit fiddly as the compost will want to fall out, so pack it in as tight as you can. Break a rooted rosette large enough to fill the rest of each hole from each plant, and gently push each one into the compost. Sit each brick in a tray of water until the compost is fully saturated, then put them on your windowsill. If there is any danger of them tumbling off, you should secure wire through the holes before you start and use this to tie the bricks on to a hook attached to the side of the window frame.</p> <p>Eventually the rosettes will smother the bricks and the plants will thrive in this inhospitable environment because the bricks are porous and will absorb and release just the right amount of water. In the hottest weather, you can slosh some water over them to help out. You will have to do a little maintenance every now and then: pick off some dead rosettes and flower stalks, maybe give them a foliage feed once in a while. But that's it, and I bet the bees will visit your windowsill. </p> <h2>Plant your pips </h2> <p>The range of houseplants from garden centres or DIY stores can be a little boring, majoring on palms, cacti and ferns. I wanted something cheap and something that was to hand in whichever city I was living in. I found it in the stuff that usually gets thrown out. </p> <p>I started with the obvious - the avocado seed. I love its kitsch 70s appeal; think of Mary Ann Singleton in Tales of the City sprouting her lunchtime avocado at her office desk. It is a great houseplant as it doesn't mind a fair amount of neglect and rewards any love with a full flush of growth. Most people know the avocado stone, toothpicks and jar of water trick from childhood. It is a bit hit-and-miss, but with patience most do sprout. There are other ways. I found in a very neglectful moment that if you just leave the whole stone covered in water in a bowl, it will sprout. Once it has sprouted, you can convert to the toothpick and jar method. You can also get avocados to sprout super-quickly in a worm bin, and fairly quickly in a compost bin, but it is hard to find them once you have put them in. As soon as the stone has sprouted roots and a shoot, transplant it into a 20cm (8in) pot.</p> <p>What about the rest of the fruit bowl and vegetable rack?</p> <p>There are a few considerations to grocery gardening. Many modern fruits and vegetables have inhibitors to stop them germinating in storage - this is particularly true of potatoes - and it is best to go for organic produce where possible. Some stuff just doesn't have any seed to germinate - clearly you will never get a banana seed. And some produce will be hybrid varieties, so you might not get what you expect. </p> <p>A general rule for germinating from fruit is that the riper it is, the better - even rotten - as these seeds have had time to mature. If your mango or avocado was hard, the seed probably won't be ready. If you work with the seasons, you always get better results, so start sprouting seeds in late spring and early summer and you will have enough light to get things going. </p> <p>Papaya is easy to germinate and plants grow fast. Clean the seeds and germinate them in two-thirds compost mixed with one-third grit or vermiculite, sowing about 1.5cm (\u00bdin) deep. Water the compost liberally but don't completely saturate it, cover the pot with a plastic bag and leave it on a sunny windowsill. In warm, bright conditions, seedlings are quick to sprout. Remove the bag once seedlings have popped up, and water frequently without drowning them. Repot into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Mature plants need a bright location and regular watering. If they don't get enough water, they will drop their leaves all at once; shortly afterwards they will droop and die. </p> <p>Papayas are not for the neglectful gardener, but if you love them, they will grow as big as you let them. </p> <p>Mango seed is best harvested from almost rotting fruit. Clean all the stringy bits and pulp from the seed and leave it overnight to dry. With a sharp knife, cut carefully down one side of the seed and take out the bean. Sow it flat, 2.5cm (1in) deep, and cover the pot with a plastic bag. Remove the plastic bag only when the seedling is up and standing strong, about 5cm (2in) tall. Mangoes like moist, fertile soil and sunny conditions. A regular liquid feed does them good. </p> <p>Limes, lemons, oranges and grapefruit can all be grown from seed and make lovely houseplants, though they will rarely fruit indoors. Choose ripe or even slightly overripe fruit and sow fresh seed in the summer in pots filled with two-thirds multipurpose compost and one-third grit. Make sure there is a good layer of grit at the bottom for extra drainage and cover the pot with another 5mm (\u00bcin) layer of grit. Don't allow your seedlings to dry out and weed out any puny ones. Once a few are well established, you can knock them out of the pot, carefully transplanting each one into a 9cm (3\u00bdin) pot to start with. I'm afraid your plants won't flower until they are at least seven years old, but the glossy leaves smell lovely and they are handsome plants. </p> <p>Pomegranates can also be successfully sown, provided that you first let the seed dry out for a few days by spreading it on a kitchen towel. Then carefully clean any off residue and sow the seed 1.5cm (\u00bdin) deep in good, moist potting compost and cover the pot with a plastic bag. Keep it on a sunny windowsill and be patient; the seed takes up to two months to germinate before you can de-bag the pot. Don't let the compost dry out and, when seedlings appear, keep them moist. The best time to germinate seed is late spring and early summer so pomegranates can benefit from time outside in hot summers. </p> <h2>Eat up your weeds </h2> <p>They used to be part of people's diets, but we now have so much choice that we rarely fill our plates with weeds. Eating them into submission is very satisfying. Chickweed is good in salads, not unlike winter purslane. It has a fresh, green taste and can also be used in soups, but you have to pick a whole heap. Ground elder was a Roman treat as it was around even in winter. You eat it a bit like spinach, picking only the young leaves and gradually exhausting the plant. Fat hen is a medieval herb used, unsurprisingly, to fatten hens. It is a big, thirsty annual that looks a bit like dock but tastes good enough in salads or stemmed like spinach. </p> <p>Stinging nettles are packed full of vitamin C and young leaves make a delicious spring soup. Young dandelion leaves are very good for indigestion - slightly bitter, but a good addition to salads and very tasty sauteed. Japanese knotweed is enough to make most gardeners weep, but sauteeing, steaming or simmering the young shoots is one sort of revenge. They have a slightly tart taste that is like either asparagus or rhubarb, depending on whom you speak to. Choose young shoots 15-20cm (6in-8in) long, and discard any leaves, as these are too tough. </p> <h2>Kill it with Coke</h2> <p>Gardeners have made their own weed controls for generations, but home-made herbicides and pesticides are illegal under current EU legislation. They are included here only for non-EU gardeners. </p> <p>The most effective home-made weedkiller is a mixture of four cups of vinegar to half a cup of salt and a couple of teaspoons of washing-up liquid. When the salt is fully dissolved, just spray or wipe it on to broad-leaved weeds such as docks and ground elder. Unfortunately, it is lethal to all other plants around it as well. It works best in sunny conditions. Coca-Cola is surprisingly good for killing off weeds in pavement cracks. It is a bit sticky, but very effective if used on a sunny day. </p> <p>You and your hoe are the best and cheapest weedkillers out there, however. If you are out hoeing the tops off annual plants first thing in the morning, the weeds will burn off in the sun. Nothing is more effective. Hoe in dry weather so weeds don't get the chance to regenerate. </p> <h2>Brew your own fertiliser </h2> <p>Some plants are so packed with energy and nutrients that they can be used to feed others. Even if you have to buy comfrey plants to start with, once they are established you may never need to buy commercially made plant food. Nettles, though not quite so powerful, are free.</p> <p>Comfrey is a deep-rooted, hardy perennial that is found throughout Europe. Its leaves are high in potash, a source of potassium important for cell division, and also have good levels of nitrogen and phosphate. Three forms of comfrey make good all-round fertilisers. Common wild forms Symphytum officinale and Symphytum asperum are useful as leaves for compost or for tea. \"Bocking 14\" is a cultivar of Russian comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum). Comfrey can also be put on the compost to act as an activator and speed up the composting process. I tend to grow a clump next to my compost for this reason. </p> <p>Symphytum officinale and Sasperum both seed freely. If you know someone with a plant, ask them for a division or for some seed to sow in autumn. \"Bocking 14\" is sterile, so you have to take root cuttings. </p> <p>Comfrey tea is made from steeped leaves, and can be used as a general-purpose fertiliser or pick-me-up. On newly established plants, harvest only half the leaves and send any flowering stalks to the compost bin. Otherwise, harvest by cutting the leaves right down to the ground. Established plants can be harvested up to four times a year. Stuff as many fresh or wilted leaves as possible into a container with a tightly fitting lid and fill it with water. Exact quantities are not too important. Weigh the lid down with bricks and after 10 days or so your brew will start to ferment. You will know it is doing well when you can barely get near the container, as comfrey stinks when it is rotting - that's where the tight-fitting lid comes in. </p> <p>I almost relish the stench now because I know that what most offends my nose will please the plants. As a rule, however, I never use comfrey on houseplants. It just smells too much indoors. </p> <p>Nettles also make an effective tea. Young spring plants make the strongest concoction; as with comfrey, when it really starts to smell you'll know it's ready.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Adapted from <strong>The Thrifty Gardener: How to Create a Stylish Garden for Next to Nothing </strong>by Alys Fowler, to be published by Kyle Cathie on September 25 at \u00a316.99.

He joined the company at the age of 18 and worked there for 25 years but was told that, because of his sacking, he would only receive eight days' holiday pay. </p> <p>\"I feel very disappointed and disillusioned with what M&amp;S have done,\" he said.</p> <p>GMB's general secretary, Paul Kenny, said the sacking was \"totally disproportionate\".</p> <p>Accusations were also made that staff surveys that claimed to be anonymous were not, because staff who complained about bullying could be traced.</p> <p>CCTV was used in the company's headquarters and security passes allowed the system to trace when people moved in and out of company HQ. </p> <p>The company confirmed that it did have a security pass system to check when people left the building but said that it followed a requirement by the fire brigade. A company spokeswoman said: \"We could not possibly monitor his personal phone calls and we are not able to trace individuals taking part in staff surveys because they have to be anonymous to get the truest result.\"</p> <p>The company was not able to answer a further allegation from Goode that M&amp;S kept data on its store card customers dating back to 1986. The spokeswoman said the company did keep data on customers but could not say how far back records were kept.</p>",
  "<p>Harlequins recovered from eight points down to end their season with a surprise win against third-placed Catalans as they bade farewell to several players, among them Henry Paul, who is leaving for rugby union, and the retiring Scott Hill.</p> <p>The visitors were in front through Adam Mogg's try and two goals by Aaron Gorrell but once Will Sharp broke the line on halfway and raced home untouched to score for Harlequins, the Twickenham side took control. Brian McDermott's team had attempted to play adventurous rugby from the off and, when the passes started to stick, Catalans were outplayed. </p> <p>Chad Randall and Rob Purdham combined to score 22 unanswered points in 12 minutes before half-time and then the outstanding prop Daniel Heckenberg finished a thrilling move in the left corner. Purdham missed the kick but two minutes later he was stretching out a hand to touch down a kick to make it 22-8. </p> <p>The Catalans dominated possession after half-time but never got close to scoring while Quins' departing France captain, Julien Rinaldi, scrambled over and Purdham converted. Casey McGuire and Dimitri Pelo pulled tries back for Catalans and, after another Pelo try and Gorrell kick, the lead was just four points. However, Rinaldi forced his way over again from short range and Paul kicked his 99th goal for the club - his final points after 12 seasons of top flight rugby league - to ensure victory.</p> <p><strong>Harlequins</strong> Sharp; Wells, Howell, Clubb, Melling; Hill, Orr; Ward, Randall, Haggerty, Temata, Purdham, Paul. </p> <p><strong>Interchange</strong> Mbu, Rinaldi, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Heckenberg.</p> <p><strong>Catalans</strong> Greenshields; Pelo, Wilson, Raguin, Stacul; Mogg, McGuire; Elima, Gorrell, Guisset, Mounis, Croker, Carlaw. <strong>Interchange</strong> Chan, Casty, Touxagas, Fakir. </p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> R Silverwood (Mirfield).</p>",
  "<p><strong>Newspapers</strong><br>I get the Independent for the journey to and from work. On Saturdays I get the Times, and on Sundays the Observer - whose monthly supplements are superb - and the Sunday Mirror. I get those primarily for the three very different approaches to the same subject matter and also because it breaks the stranglehold of all those jumper-over-the-shoulder yah-yahs who live in south-west London and buy the News of the World and the Sunday Times every week, read the former and put the Sunday Times into the recycling, unread. My wife has asked me to stop making sheep noises whenever people buy that particular combination but I can't help myself. I've also got a secret Telegraph habit, but only for the sport and the obituaries.</p> <p><strong>Magazines</strong><br>I read Esquire, the Spectator - because you have to know what your enemy is thinking and it's actually very funny - Private Eye and Uncut, which, even though it's slipped a bit of late, is still a quality product.

  "<p>Asif Ali Zardari will be sworn in tomorrow as Pakistan's president, following his election victory at the weekend, amid warnings from opposition voices that the country is in danger of a \"civilian dictatorship\" after the military rule of General Pervez Musharraf.</p> <p>Zardari inherits a country facing a deep economic and security crisis, where the hold of democracy is still fragile. The widower of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto will have to reconcile the domestic unpopularity of the country's alliance with the west in the \"war against terror\" with international demands that Islamabad must do more to rein in extremists based in Pakistan's tribal territory, who threaten Nato's mission in Afghanistan.</p> <p>US attacks in the tribal area, especially an unprecedented ground assault last week, have raised angry demands that the country abandon \"America's war\".</p> <p>Few question the right of Zardari, 53, to be president, following his overwhelming election by an electoral college consisting of the parliament and regional assemblies, unlike Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup. But Zardari's ruthless reputation and the concentration of power in his hands have raised concern. As president and leader of the ruling Pakistan People's party, he will control government and parliament. As party boss, he chose the prime minister and can similarly dismiss him. The PPP controls three of the four provincial governments.</p> <p>Although Pakisan is supposed to have a parliamentary system, where the prime minister is chief executive, Musharraf ran the country under powers that Zardari will inherit. He also inherits a judiciary tamed by Musharraf. As president, Zardari will be immune from criminal charges.</p> <p>\"This is the real test,\" said Ahsan Iqbal, a leading member of Nawaz Sharif's party, which recently left the ruling coalition to become the biggest opposition group. \"The parliamentary system assumes the prime minister is the chief executive. But if the president is the fountainhead of power, that creates a logjam.\"</p> <p>After his election on Saturday, Zardari vowed to \"correct the imbalance\" between the presidency and the parliament, but did not say whether he would give up the leadership of the PPP. The president is by convention a non-party figure. \"Democracy talks, and everyone hears,\" Zardari said in a speech. \"To those who would say the PPP, or the presidency, would be controversial under our guardianship, I say, listen to democracy. Ninety-nine per cent of the people have spoken.\"</p> <p>Nisar Memon, a senator from the pro-Musharraf opposition party, said: \"They [the government] have been consolidating power, not addressing the real issues of the people. My fear is we are moving from military rule to a civilian dictatorship.\" The accusation Zardari seeks unchecked power is fuelled by his continued refusal to reinstate the chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, removed by Musharraf.</p>",
  "<p>The game in the Premiership is heading for a nervous breakdown, if this match is any barometer. Movement was supplied mainly by the arms of the referee, Sean Davey, who reacted to the International Rugby Board's directive to be strict on indiscretions after a tackle by conducting a lesson in semaphore.</p> <p>A succession of penalties ensured an afternoon of little flow. It says a lot about the IRB that it felt the need to issue such a disruptive directive at the same time that players, coaches and referees had to grapple with 13 law changes: perhaps it was retributive in nature, given the European unions' refusal to have anything to do with the most unhinged of the experimental law variations. Whatever the reason, it ensured that only penalties flowed <br>here yesterday.</p> <p>Not that Northampton's supporters were complaining after a year of watching first division fare. Saints won because they dominated the breakdown, where Worcester missed their injured captain, Pat Sanderson. The Warriors were turned over or penalised throughout the match, which made it all the more inexplicable that they chose to run two penalties, one of which was close to the Northampton line, in the second half rather than opt for a scrum. Turned over at the first and blown up at the second, they deserved to leave empty-handed.</p> <p>Worcester had little in the way of quick ball and their new full-back, Chris Latham, found himself on the margins. \"It is too early to judge the law changes and directive on the evidence of one match, but today certainly prompted some concerns,\" said the Warriors' head coach, Mike Ruddock. \"We want to generate quick ball and move it, not resort to kicking.\"</p> <p>The game turned on an incident at the breakdown eight minutes into the second half. Worcester were leading by two penalties to one after the Northampton captain, Bruce Reihana, had missed two attempts well within his range.</p> <p>The Ireland flanker Neil Best made some rousing charges for the home team and the Worcester centre Sam Tuitupou was the one back unfazed by the midfield clutter, but neither side looked like scoring until the player deputising for Sanderson, Tom Wood, went off his feet at a breakdown in his own 22 and was shown a yellow card.</p> <p>Reihana kicked the resulting penalty. As Wood trudged off he was offered a consoling word by a replacement coming on to the field, Dylan Hartley. The England squad hooker had been left out of the Saints starting line-up in favour of Ireland's Paul Shields, on the grounds of pre-season form, but within four minutes of his arrival, after the ball had gone through a couple of phases, Hartley was tackled by Matt Powell, but not held, and placed the ball over the line.</p> <p>Hartley was at fault for Worcester's try, eight minutes from the end, when he missed his opposite number, Aleki Lutui, but Northampton had by then built a buffer after the centre Jon Clarke crossed on the right following an attack from a lineout. Reihana's third penalty, four minutes from time, after yet another breakdown offence, robbed Worcester of a losing bonus point.</p> <p>With both sides unimpressive at the set pieces, the breakdown was the key area and Northampton profited from the control they exerted there. \"It was not the prettiest of games but it was a vital win,\" said Saints' director of rugby, Jim Mallinder. \"I am not going to get carried away because we have another 21 tough games to come.\"</p> <p>They will face far sterner contests at the breakdown, but such is the arbitrary nature of directives and diktats that while every indiscretion after a tackle was penalised, other offences went unpunished. Matt Powell hardly had his best game for Worcester, but the scrum-half could have been forgiven for wondering whether the offside line had been redrawn. </p> <p><strong>Northampton</strong> Reihana (capt); Ashton, Clarke, Downey, Lamont; Spencer, Dickson (Foden, 78); Tonga'uiha (Smith, 62), Shields (Hartley, 48), Murray, Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe (Lord, 70), Day, Best (Hopley, 68), Gray, Wilson.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Hartley, Clarke. <strong>Con </strong>Reihana. <strong>Pens</strong> Reihana 3.</p> <p><strong>Worcester</strong> Latham; Gear, Rasmussen, Tuitupou, Benjamin; Jones, M Powell (R Powell, 62); Mullan, Lutui, Taumoepeau (Horsman, 53), Rawlinson (capt), Gillies (Bowley, 62), Talei, Wood (Collins, 59), Horstmann.</p> <p><strong>Try</strong> Lutui. <strong>Con </strong>Jones. <strong>Pens</strong> Jones 2.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Wood 48.</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>S Davey (London). <strong>Attendance</strong> 13,094.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Evershed's memory (Letters, September 4) of my brother-in-law Ken Campbell giving a \"private version of his show\" in his college common room has prompted me to remember a similar event. The circumstances were - or should have been - sadder: he was talking to my dying mother and bewildered father in their sitting room. He went into a \"Campbell riff\" just for them - I don't think he knew there was anyone else in the room. He restored their morale, and had them laughing away at his inspired \"nonsense\", probably better medicine than our \"sense\".</p> <p>As for the \"material\" Bill hopes someone will collect, there will be no Ken to utter it. But here's an anecdote to cheer him, I hope. Ken was teaching his parrot to be truly original, by dint of teaching it parrot discourse, rather than, say, pidgin or human.

  "<p><strong>Police say Olmert should be indicted for corruption</strong></p> <p>Israel's police have recommended indictments against the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, according to Israeli media. The reports said the police want to indict Olmert for affairs that include receiving tens of thousands of dollars from a US businessman and double-billing Jewish groups for trips abroad. No official announcement by police has been made, and the recommendation would have limited political effect. The decision to indict Olmert rests with the attorney general, Meni Mazuz.

  "<p>Gordon Brown is right. That's a four-word sentence you don't often hear these days, but the prime minister was correct when he said in Glasgow last week that Britain is being dragged down by what he called \"the first great financial crisis of the global age\". This is not a uniquely UK problem as was the case with most of the economic emergencies in the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>The prime minister also has a case when he says that Britain is better placed to weather the global economic storm than it was in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although not for the reasons he states. In many respects, the structural defects of the economy are more glaring than they have ever been. Britain's balance of trade has sunk deeper and deeper into the red over the past decade as consumption has outstripped production. The manufacturing sector has shed more than a million jobs. The strong growth in the economy in the years running up to the credit crunch was largely the result of large inflows of capital necessary to fund the trade deficit creating two linked bubbles in housing and financial services.</p> <p>The reason Britain may be better placed than other countries to cope with the downturn is nothing to do with the supposed improvement in productivity (illusory) or the strength of the competition regime (a prime ministerial boast that rings hollow in the light of the oligopolistic behaviour of the domestic energy sector). Rather, it has more to do with the freedom of the Bank of England to set appropriate interest rates, and for the pound to find its own level on the foreign exchanges. </p> <p>The British pro-euro faction has recently started to rediscover its voice, having been silent since Brown said in 2003 that the five tests for monetary union had not been passed. But its argument that Britain would now be better off inside the eurozone is fatuous, and not just because the bigger economies of monetary union - Germany, France and Italy - started to contract even before Britain did. During the boom years, the UK would have had inappropriately low interest rates, which would have led to an even bigger housing bubble and an even bigger current account deficit. Britain would have been Spain with knobs on. During the bust, Britain would have found itself not only like post-bubble Spain but also like Italy, which suffers from a severe lack of competitiveness but has only one tool - a squeeze on wages - to deal with it.</p> <p>In the spirit of fairness, it has to be admitted that the policy freedom enjoyed by the UK is more theoretical than real. Labour's pro-speculator and anti-industry bias has left the country far less capable of exploiting the benefits of a lower pound than ought to be the case. What's more the freedom of the Bank of England to set interest rates at the level that is right for Britain is relevant only if the monetary policy committee uses that freedom rather than behaving like a branch of the European Central Bank. </p> <p>The need for policy makers to get macro-economic conditions right was the theme of last week's annual report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). Although concentrating primarily on emerging and developing economies, the findings of the study are also relevant for countries such as Britain. </p> <p><strong>Classical theory </strong></p> <p>The Unctad report seeks to explain an apparent paradox, namely that capital has been flowing from developing countries to developed countries whereas classical economic theory says it should be the other way round. According to the textbook model of the world, rich countries export their capital to poor countries to foster faster growth. But for the past 10 years, countries such as China have been exporting capital to the US and Britain so that we can live beyond our means.</p> <p>Heiner Flassbeck, the editor of the report, says the big change occurred at the time of the Asian crisis in 1997-98. Countries such as South Korea and Thailand found that they were vulnerable to massive inflows and outflows of hot money and were determined that there should be no repetition. As a result, they locked in the benefits of the devaluation forced upon them by capital flight by intervention in the currency markets and by keeping the lid on the cost of borrowing to consumers and businesses. In China, direct intervention by the government has ensured that market interest rates in east Asia - the price of money for the customers of commercial banks rather than the policy rate set by central banks - are kept low.</p> <p>Rising exports generated profits for companies in the developing countries and these surpluses were then available for re-investment. China and the other emerging economies have had stronger growth and higher investment ratios than the countries receiving their capital and are clearly comfortable with this model than the old Washington consensus one, which focused on foreign direct investment and financial deregulation to generate the savings for investment.</p> <p>As Unctad points out, the new Asian model is catching on in other parts of the world as well. Latin America provides a contrast between Argentina, which since the debt crisis of 2001-02 has enjoyed rapid growth based on a cheap currency and low interest rates, and Brazil, which has followed a much more orthodox monetary policy. Neither country is problem free. Flassbeck says rising inflationary pressure in Argentina stems from the failure to follow the example of Asian countries that have used the minimum wage and other forms of incomes policy to control wages; Brazil is heavily dependent on the export of commodities. </p> <p><strong>Low-cost centres</strong></p> <p>The countries that were once in the Soviet bloc have also followed a more traditional route than those in Asia. Their accession to the European Union and optimism about their prospects as low-cost production centres led to massive capital inflows, which have pushed up exchange rates and produced increasingly large current account deficits. </p> <p>From 1999 to 2007, the real effective exchange rate in eastern Europe and the Russian Federation appreciated by 30% and the average current account deficit more than doubled to around 9% of GDP. The vulnerability of these countries to capital flight is illustrated by Hungary, where 90% of mortgages are denominated not in forints but in Swiss francs and Japanese yen.</p> <p>Eastern Europe now looks like an accident waiting to happen. Indeed, it is the likeliest flashpoint for the next stage of the unfolding crisis, provided Italy does not get there first. Russia is less vulnerable than its old satellites but the erosion of manufacturing competitiveness has been disguised by soaring oil and gas prices. Like Brazil, it will look a lot less healthy when the bubble in commodities has deflated and, on current trends, that moment is imminent.</p> <p>There are important lessons from the Unctad study. One is that developed countries with large current account surpluses - Germany and Japan primarily - need policies that stimulate domestic demand. A second is that developing countries seeking a growth model would be better off looking to Beijing than Washington for inspiration. Finally, if the prime minister is really serious about abolishing boom and bust and raising Britain's growth rate, having an over-valued currency, a hollowed out industrial sector and a reliance on hot money is a mighty strange way of going about it. It's vital to learn the lessons of globalisation , even more important to learn the right ones.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Hollywood directors Joel and Ethan Coen called Oscar-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones \"the real thing\" when they gave him a leading role in their 2007 blockbuster No Country for Old Men.</p> <p>As a gritty Texas sheriff on the trail of a mass murderer, Jones delivered a memorable performance that helped the film receive four Academy awards, including best picture, and more than $160m (\u00a391m) at the box office worldwide.</p> <p>Now, in a move likely to prompt studio lawyers to re-examine the contracts of many of Tinsel Town's leading actors, Jones is claiming a greater share of the film's profits. </p> <p>The 61-year-old actor has filed a $10m lawsuit against production powerhouse Paramount Pictures for promised bonuses he says he was never paid when the film became a runaway success.</p> <p>Jones, whose own Oscar success came as a supporting actor in the 1993 film The Fugitive, is making no public comment about the lawsuit filed in Bexar County, Texas. \"The paperwork stands for itself,\" said Jennifer Allen, a spokeswoman for the actor.</p> <p>But court papers show that Jones claims he took a reduced fee prior to filming in exchange for \"significant box-office bonuses\", and was promised other financial incentives that were not paid due to errors in his contract that were never corrected.</p> <p>Paramount, and its Holland-based subsidiary NM Classics Inc, also named in the lawsuit, has yet to respond.</p> <p>The Coen brothers wanted Jones for the role of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in their big-screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's crime novel because they said his Texas background made him a convincing character. </p> <p>The plot features a botched drug deal and Bell's subsequent pursuit of assassin Anton Chigurh, a role that won a best supporting actor Oscar for Javier Bardem.</p> <p>\"There are just very, very few people who can carry a role like this one,\" Joel Coen said of Jones.</p> <p>\"He's from San Saba, Texas, not far from where the movie takes place.

  "<p>People wonder why asexuals bother to get together, but Amanda and I have been happily married for nine months now and we're both still virgins. Some people even think asexuality doesn't exist. It's so underrepresented, I can understand why people are skeptical. I was too, even though I was perfectly used to thinking of myself in this way. For years I just thought I was the only person in the world who felt like this. </p> <p>My parents are agricultural scientists, so I've lived overseas since around the age of 10. I was in India until I was 16, then Zimbabwe for two years, and then Kuwait. I studied in China and New York, before settling in London. Even at 10, I had a sense that I didn't want to get married and have children. I know a lot of kids say things like that, but I didn't change my mind about it later on. I wasn't interested in relationships or finding a girlfriend, and was very sure I didn't have an interest in boys either. </p> <p>Gradually my school friends spent more and more time talking about girls and pursuing relationships, but I could never grasp what they were expecting to get out of it. There were family parties in India where all the kids would gather outside in the garden. </p> <p>I was 13 and had a best friend, Kasim, who was a year younger than me. He had a crush on an Australian girl called Jessica - everyone seemed to think she was the prettiest. We had lots of whispered discussions about what he could say to her, and even though I thought it was a ridiculous game, I wanted to fit in, so I pretended I had a crush too - on a French girl called Sylvie. She was a safe bet because she was so unlikely to reciprocate. I knew she wasn't at all interested in me. I'd just discuss her with the boys. </p> <p>There were times as I got older when girls did seem interested in me, but I always deliberately ignored their signals. I wanted to avoid getting into a situation I'd feel uncomfortable with, so I never even kissed a girl. The first girl I kissed became my wife. </p> <p>When I was 13, my father gave me a book on sex education. I felt as if I was reading about a foreign culture; I just couldn't see why anyone would go to so much trouble just to have sex. I tried looking at pornography on the internet. I wasn't disgusted or appalled - it was just boring, like looking at wallpaper.</p> <p>Masturbation was another topic of conversation in those days, and I did masturbate. It wasn't a sexual urge for me, I didn't fantasise, it was just something my body decided to do. People say about asexuals: \"But if they masturbate doesn't that make them sexual?\" It's hard to explain, but if you're asexual you don't necessarily feel an explicit connection between masturbation and sexual orientation. It's just part of having a human body - a physical, biological process. </p> <p>After we moved to Zimbabwe I went back to visit my old friend Kasim. The last time we'd seen each other we'd been into computer games, drinking Coke and going for pizza. Two years on, it was a shock to see how much Kasim had changed. Sex was his major preoccupation. He had a girlfriend and was on the brink of going all the way with her. One afternoon we were with some of Kasim's friends, and he began goading two of the girls into kissing each other in front of a camera. The whole atmosphere was really charged, and I felt out of my depth. I'd fallen behind. Kasim had been my friend a long time, but he'd entered this different world without me. </p> <p>By the time I went to university, I was happy to let people wonder about my sexuality. I wasn't pretending to talk about girls any more. Some people assumed I was gay, but my best friend Simon was the first person to confront me directly. We were studying in Hangzhou, in China, just south of Shanghai. It's a very beautiful city, on a lake with mountains, and we were walking through the streets when Simon asked me outright. First he made a joke about whether \"I liked girls ... or boys?\" I laughed but he persisted and said \"So what are you?\" I just said, \"I'm not straight and I'm not gay, and that's it, full stop.\" Back then I didn't know what term to use.</p> <p>The following summer I was surfing the internet when I read a post from a girl who wasn't attracted to anyone. Someone had suggested she should be aware of \"asexuality\", and gave the address of a website: <a href=\"http://www.asexuality.org\">asexuality.org</a>. When I went to the site and read the material, I was quite dismissive at first, because you just don't hear about other asexuals. Since Freud and Kinsey, and even to an extent the sexual revolution of the 60s, we tend to believe anyone without a sexual orientation must be repressed or delusional. Asexuality is therefore an impossibility. Kinsey labelled us \"X\", a statistical throwaway category for anyone damaged to the point where they can't express any sexuality. </p> <p>Gradually, though, through visiting the site, I came to realise that these were just ordinary people; people who were writing things I'd thought myself, but had never heard anyone else express. It was such a relief. Finally I had a label - a way to explain myself that could settle all the awkwardness and questioning. </p> <p>I told my close friends straightaway. Only one female friend didn't really believe me. I think she thought I was secretly in love with her. </p> <p>Back at college I decided to get it over with in one day by wearing a T-shirt saying: \"Asexuality is not just for amoebas\". I was nervous, but I'd already told a dozen or so people, and was used to answering the same questions over and over. No one has ever reacted really badly to me - I've been lucky. </p> <p>I told my mother shortly after finding the asexual website, and she said: \"Well as long as you understand the possibility that one of these days you'll meet someone and want to settle down with them.\" I wasn't so sure. I'd already resigned myself to a solitary existence. I'd convinced myself I could form strong friendships and was independent enough to fare OK. Luckily my mother always ends up being right about everything.</p> <p>When my studies took me to New York, I got more involved with the asexual community there. I posted messages on their website and there were regular meet-ups in a little pink tea shop in the East Village - I guess you could call it the asexual equivalent of a gay bar.</p> <p>One day I got an email from Amanda. She was asexual, living close by, and offered to show me around the neighbourhood. In case she was cruising for an asexual boyfriend, I responded with a warning that I was \"vehemently anti-romantic\". But we met up anyway, for tea and ice-skating, and we took to meeting a lot. </p> <p>I loved Amanda's attitude to life and enjoyed hanging out with her. And she was pretty. At first I tried to treat it like any other friendship. Then I found myself travelling four miles downtown to deliver sandwiches when she told me she was hungry. Two months in, we were at a gig and it seemed like a good idea to hold her hand. I felt cautious about it but just wanted to. I wondered if I could. Then I found I couldn't let go. </p> <p>That evening ended with us agreeing that our friendship was an important thing. We wanted to commit for life. In the asexual community we don't form relationships lightly. If you don't want to spend the rest of your life with a person, there's no reason to make such a special commitment. </p> <p>When we announced our engagement, our families were happy for us, and our friends in the asexual community were particularly pleased. On our wedding night, my mother-in-law insisted on booking us into a honeymoon suite, so we invited all our friends to an after party. We played Scrabble late into the night and everyone stayed over and slept on the hotel-room floor. </p> <p>People always ask how our marriage is different from just being friends, but I think a lot of relationships are about that - being friends. We have built on our friendship, rather than scrapping it and moving on somewhere else. The obvious way we differ is that we don't have sex, though we do kiss and cuddle. We like to joke that the longer we're married the less unusual this is. By the time we've been married five years we'll be just like everyone else. </p> <p>Do I feel as if I'm missing out on something? Not really. We've decided that if either of us wants to try sex out in the future then we will see what we can do. We would both be willing to compromise because we're in a relationship and that's what you do. </p> <p>When it comes to the future and to children, we're big advocates of adoption. We're not so fussed about passing on our own genes. Right now we're quite happy with what we've got. After moving around so much, I can say now that wherever Amanda is - that's home.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Paul Cox was interviewed by Bridget O'Donnell.

  "<p>A weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes has proved safe and effective for patients in a trial involving 259 volunteers.</p> <p>The formulation is a version of a previously available treatment called exenatide, which mimics one of the body's hormones. The existing version must be self-injected by patients twice daily. The trial showed that the slow-acting form was more effective than the original at keeping glucose levels in the blood under control, and more convenient to use.</p> <p>\"There is currently no available therapy for type 2 diabetes that patients can receive once a week,\" said Dr Daniel Drucker at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount Sinai hospital in Toronto. The new formulation will need further clinical trials before being licensed for use by patients.</p> <p>According to Diabetes UK, more than 2.3 million people in the UK have the disease, and more than half a million people have the condition but do not know they are suffering from it. </p> <p>The disease leads to the body not being able to properly regulate blood sugar levels. The peaks and troughs that occur without regulation can lead to damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart and arteries. In the six-month study, half of the patients received the new weekly injections while the rest received injections of the previous, twice-daily version. </p> <p>Of those receiving the weekly dose, 77% kept their blood sugar levels below a benchmark set by the researchers. Sixty-one per cent of the patients receiving daily injections reached the same benchmark. The patients on the newer treatment also suffered fewer side-effects. The results are reported in the Lancet.</p> <p>\"The once-a-week formulation, besides obvious improved ease of use, provided the remarkable advantage of both improved efficacy on glucose control and good gastrointestinal tolerability,\" said Dr Andr\u00e9 Scheen, of the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, who was not involved in the study.</p>",
  "<p>In Britain we do not approve of criminal trials which take place in the absence of the accused. It does not seem fair that someone charged with a serious offence, especially one that could lead to a prison sentence, is not there to contest the accusations. Our system does allow trials in absentia in some circumstances - for instance where the defendant flees mid-trial - but we try to keep them to a minimum. </p> <p>Most other EU members do not suffer from such reticence; I have personal experience of this. Some years ago I was arrested two days after arriving in a European country and told of a warrant out against me. I learned a few hours later that I had been tried and convicted a few years before and sentenced to 12 months' jail. I had been totally unaware of the crime I had allegedly committed, and that I had been prosecuted, tried and sentenced. After a few days in custody I was allowed to appeal and things were more or less sorted out. </p> <p>Last week the European parliament, by a huge majority, adopted EU proposals that will regularise trials in absentia in member states, and facilitate the handing over, under a European arrest warrant, of people convicted in their absence. So, for instance, Greece could demand that Britain sends back a UK holidaymaker convicted in absentia of some alleged misbehaviour in Greece. The proposals now go to the council of ministers and are certain to become law. </p> <p>However, a Tory MEP has said the plans amount to \"throwing habeas corpus out of the window\". The European Bar Association says the rules are \"a violation of the fundamental procedural rights of the accused\". Fair Trials Abroad condemns the proposals. </p> <p>At the heart of the criticism is British suspicion of foreign criminal justice systems. It starts with the mistaken but widely held view that under the law in the rest of Europe an accused person is presumed guilty until proved innocent, whereas in England, the pure fount of justice, it's the other way around. </p> <p>I do not deny there have been examples of British suspects or defendants being treated unjustly by the laws of other countries (though let us not forget that our system is by no means free of miscarriages of justice). </p> <p>On the issue of trials in absentia, though, the criticism of the EU plans is misplaced. There will be safeguards. Those tried in absentia and not represented by a lawyer will be guaranteed a retrial. So will those who had no idea they were being put on trial or did not have proper notice of the trial; they will be able to arrange a proper defence. A country not playing by the rules will not be able to issue a valid arrest warrant forcing Britain to surrender a citizen. That seems like a good thing to me.</p>",
  "<p>My home has been invaded. Over in one corner, ruffling his hair and harrumphing in Latin, is Boris Johnson. Holding forth in the front room are Caroline Lucas and Zac Goldsmith. You can hardly hear yourself think in the kitchen for the voice, part machine-gun, part buzz-saw, of Sarah Palin, who has only recently taken over from Barack Obama. Alex Salmond, meanwhile, is shouting about something in the garden.</p> <p>These are political characters whose collective presence, through radio, telly, the net and newspapers, has become unavoidable. Their voices, quips, soundbites, ideas and flaws bubble through. Like them or loathe them, this autumn they are part of the household. From left or right, over here or over there, is there something they have in common?</p> <p>The answer is that none of them seem to be ordinary politicians. They have stories to tell that are slightly unexpected, fresher than the stale air of business-as-usual in Washington or London. They are \"mavericks\" without being wild - well, except for Palin - and when they speak, they sound like themselves, not like somebody else. They've forced their way into our living rooms because they are characters.</p> <p>Contrast them with the shadow cabinet, and the real one. We are now ruled by a cadre of dark-suited, mainly male, politicians who rose through the ranks of Conservative Central Office, the Labour party research department, a few London-based thinktanks and PR firms, and innumerable roles as special advisers in Westminster, the last of these being basically work experience for budding politicians. If you find someone who worked briefly as a teacher, in the media or the law, you can now count yourself lucky.</p> <p>For most of those who inhabit the Westminster village, politics was an early career choice, and that in itself may have been a bad decision. They grew up thinking The West Wing was populist TV and that a glossy magazine meant the Spectator or New Statesman. They were pimpled politicians at university and moved quickly to London. They went to drink warm white wine at political lectures, seminars and conferences, wrote speeches for older politicians, then dug up facts for them, then dug up policies, found a seat and rose without bubbles or much kicking.</p> <p>Hemmed in by the limits defined for them in opinion polls and focus groups, their language is a relentless rehashing of phrases and metaphors. There are the meant-to-be-uplifting, liberal JFK-ish words about public service and new frontiers, doing things for your country and all that. There are all the 80s and 90s phrases about community, third way, \"ordinary decent people\", firmness and vision. Sometimes I close my eyes and it swirls around in a blur, like faded towels in the washing machine. They talk about voters and constituents, but they never, ever sound like them.</p> <p>Nor do the mavericks. Boris has the talent to deliver bad news, to make mistakes and gaffes - and still to be forgiven, even loved, for it. He hasn't hidden his posh accent or pretended to be in any way normal. He's climbed higher and faster than better-behaved, blander, more conventional Tories. Ken Livingstone thrived for eight years as London mayor for similar reasons. You never quite knew what he was going to say. Nor did his advisers.</p> <p>Goldsmith, another posh Tory, supports environmental protesters and is clearly not going to toe the Cameron line if his leader backs away from green issues. He, too, has a scent of the unfamiliar. Lucas, the newly crowned Green party leader, can say what she thinks because she is outside the mainstream party system.</p> <p>So the Palin phenomenon is not new and it's not surprising. You don't have to approve of anything about the woman to find her interesting. My guess, and hope, is that over the next few weeks, as floating voters in the US realise that they are supposed to be electing a president, her loopy Alaska-first and creationist views and her extreme social conservatism will start to scare them off. What she has done, though, is to look and speak differently. The \"hockey mom\" stuff is a distraction. She is not mainstream or normal. But she does seem unpredictable, a new actor on the stage still be to properly understood, and that is addictive. No wonder John McCain is trying to cash in on her success by styling himself as a \"maverick\" too.</p> <p>Obama was the outsider during the earlier stages of presidential campaigning - not fully understood, with a casual style, surprising personal story and way with words unlike ordinary candidates. Now, with the ultimate prize near, he seems to have stiffened and disciplined himself so effectively that Palin can paint him as somehow an insider. </p> <p>All politicians face the Obama dilemma. Voters want to be interested, surprised, challenged and amused - this is an entertainment culture. But we don't want loopy-loo policies as a result. We will cut people slack if they amuse us or engage us emotionally, as Boris Johnson has proved. But we want the sums to add up, the streets to be clean and the advisers to be decent.</p> <p>Boris aside, this is one area where the Tories are in just as much of a pickle as Labour or the Lib Dems. They are popular because the government is so hated. But look at their front bench - all those dark suits, rich lifestyles, timid talking, follow-my-leader clones - and ask how long we'll still like them in power.</p> <p>What is needed is the arrival in the Commons of people who have not learned professional politics, have never served as advisers and have no idea what Populus means. Local parties need to start taking risks - I'm not talking about quotas but about sparky individuals, with the odd skeleton, the occasional surprising view. The media has to celebrate different voices and faces where they appear, and not pick on every unexpected remark as a \"gaffe\". For all that the mainstream media seized on Alastair Darling's pessimistic assessment of the economy as a stupendous own goal, the general public seem to like the fact he \"told the truth\".</p> <p>The government is in a deep hole, but politics is in a worse one. A democracy is meant to be about the voices of the people - who may be raucous or rude but are preferable to a closed, monkish order of nodding heads. When a party picks its next candidate, or a leader looks for someone to promote, they should remember a new rule: the safe option has become the dangerous one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashely@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashely@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>What type of theatre is accomplished when one side has no intention of trying to win the game? What kind of judgment follows when the action takes place on such a lop-sided stage? England were trying to win and Andorra were attempting to hold on to a draw when they were actually losing 1-0. It was thoroughly bizarre but conclusions will be sought.</p> <p>Against packed defences you have to drag defenders away from their sentry duties where they are protecting the penalty area. To do this you need to hug the touchlines and maximise the width, overload round the outside and attack quickly with fast and accurate passes. It sounds simple but against 10 dustbins you need craft and guile - the sort of movement which led to England's second goal which came from a swift Gareth Barry pass into the feet of Wayne Rooney who spotted the clever run of Joe Cole.</p> <p>Croatia's backline of Vedran Corluka, Josip Simunic, Robert Kovac and Danijel Pranjic is very strong. They will not rely at home on their midfield to protect them like Andorra did, although Niko Kovac will sit deepest to allow Darijo Srna and Luka Modric to support the grafting Ivica Olic. </p> <p>The game will be more open as a result and might help Theo Walcott whose initial effort was enterprising. Here is a wide man who understands when to race forward, when to check and when to stand still to receive passes. Speed is vital provided one can appreciate when to pass and the importance of playing an early one and looking for the return. With his willing running he is a pressure point. His confidence will be high and Fabio Capello should encourage him by retaining him.</p> <p>On Saturday Walcott's tender frame survived some ill-judged Andorran obstruction - he must show more composure with his final pass but one can also level that criticism at Glen Johnson who had the advantage of coming from deeper at right-back. I expect the stronger defensive qualities of Wes Brown to get Capello's vote.</p> <p>In Zagreb England will need to improvise and show more imagination in the final third. Rooney must get closer to the opponents' goal to threaten and he needs a partner to vary the approach. Emile Heskey, a muscular Peter Crouch, should hold the fort for his physical presence but oh, how we could do with a Shearer. Occasionally we need to play a diagonal cross but we must not become obsessed with the high ball once the big man takes the lead striker spot as Simunic, the Croatia centre-half, is a giant.</p> <p>Unfortunately, on the left side, Stewart Downing may not get the opportunity to test Corluka. In Barcelona he suffered from a lack of supply and when he did get the ball could not deliver decent passes.</p> <p>Joe Cole is certain to start but it is vital the space he vacates when he comes inside is taken quickly by Ashley Cole to use his left foot to good advantage (see diagram). Against Andorra England were well-balanced with three left-footers - Ashley Cole, Barry and Downing - in the starting XI but with Andorra \"parking the bus\" so deep this positivity was nullified.</p> <p>Movement and imagination is the key for Wednesday. With Joe Cole on the left coming in, Ashley Cole will be important but Srna, the right-sided midfielder, will be tuned in and aware of this ploy. </p> <p>At least it will be a level playing field but whisper that quietly to Paul Robinson's replacement, David James. Let us hope this will not be a bumpy qualifier. England need a draw but must play to win unlike the Andorrans who played to lose with damage limitation.</p>",
  "<p>The opposition was intimidating, unstable even, but disturbingly for Scotland the worst Macedonia had to offer was restrained behind steel fencing and brooding riot police. Macedonia's players were timid in comparison to their support in Skopje, yet potent enough to inflict swift and serious harm on George Burley's route to South Africa. This was the most inauspicious start to a World Cup campaign and a manager's competitive reign.</p> <p>One game on the road to 2010 and Wednesday's visit to Iceland has already been put into the \"must-win\" category. An ominous sign. A formidable challenge too, should Scotland reproduce the dreadful first-half display that threatens lasting repercussions or fail to find the moment of quality, the touch of fortune, that prevented the warranted reprieve of a draw in Skopje.</p> <p>Burley has been beset by critical absences throughout his brief tenure and the searing afternoon heat of the Macedonia capital, the dubious free-kick that produced the only goal and an ignored penalty appeal increased the forces conspiring against a manager in desperate need of a break. Neither the hosts nor visitors wanted to kick off at 3pm but were forced to, claimed the Macedonia coach Srecko Katanec, by television schedules. </p> <p>\"I've never experienced anything like that,\" said midfielder Darren Fletcher. \"That was ridiculously hot but we've got no control over that. TV runs the game now.\" But TV did not run Scotland into the ground here.</p> <p>Stifling heat and a quest for ratings were not responsible for the wayward passing and ponderous control that belittled this performance. The lack of movement perhaps, but even when that sprang belatedly into life in the second half, the inability of James McFadden, Fletcher and others to deliver a telling final ball handicapped Burley's desire for greater adventure from a team ranked 16th in the world.</p> <p>Unlike the increased expectations that have made his task more problematic than recent predecessors, the new Scotland manager is not exactly awash with the resources to make his brave new world a reality. As he stated afterwards: \"We played our best players.\" With four central midfielders strung across the middle and only one delivering, Celtic's Barry Robson, Burley's ambition was undermined by circumstance and too many passengers on the day. Not by abandoning the caution that characterised Alex McLeish's and Walter Smith's teams away from home. </p> <p>\"We were the team in the ascendancy,\" argued Fletcher, whose side was on the back foot when Goce Sedloski's free-kick hit a post in the fifth minute and Ilco Naumoski converted the rebound from close range. \"I know we gave them the early goal, which gave them something to hold on to, but after that we took the game to them. If we hadn't gone with two up front, we might not have been able to do that. Different managers have different styles but we need to progress as a nation. We didn't qualify the last time, remember.\"</p> <p>The momentum of the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign has evaporated over the past 11 months, however. Scotland have not enjoyed a victory since Ukraine were dismantled at Hampden Park in October of last year. Then McLeish's team was painfully close to reaching their first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup. Already, they have reduced the margin of error for ending that famine. Burley has set a target of 17 points for qualification for South Africa. By that equation his nation can afford to drop only four points from their remaining seven games, and two of those are against Holland.</p> <p>For many of the Tartan Army, the misery was not confined to the pitch. Approximately 1,500 received tickets for the home sections of a barely filled stadium but the local authorities refused to create an overspill amid concerns at the behaviour of their own supporters. At one point riot police entered a pen to remove a banner hoisted in tribute to Johan Tarculovski, jailed for 12 years in The Hague for crimes against ethnic Albanians, and had to quell the violent response. It was of little consolation to the Tartan hordes stranded outside, but they were better off out of it.</p>",
  "<p>Andy Murray has reached the final of the US Open with a thrilling 6-2, 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 win over world number one Rafael Nadal. Murray outmatched Nadal from the baseline and with a series of magnificent backhands to stun the reigning Wimbledon and French Open champion and set up a final clash with Roger Federer, who has not lost at Flushing Meadows since 2003.</p> <p>Murray had been in control throughout the rain-shortened contest on Saturday and when play resumed today he was two sets ahead but a break down in the third. Nadal held that break to take the third set, and the momentum looked to be slipping back in the world number one's favour when he saved seven break points in the second game of the fourth set before immediately breaking Murray and holding his own to take a two-game lead.</p> <p>However Murray consistently looked the fresher and more inventive player, and he recovered from 0-30 in the fifth game to hold serve and regain the mental initiative. In the next game it was Nadal's turn to lose concentration at deuce, failing to put away a backhand winner at the net with a weak shot into the net and Murray seized the moment to break back at 3-3.</p> <p>He secured the break back in style with a service game to love, taking the game with a brilliant backhand winner from off the ground as Nadal looked to have saved the break with a backhand volley at the net.</p> <p>Now it was Nadal who needed something special to stay in the match against a rejuvenated Murray, but he had to dig deep just to hold serve, saving the Scot's ninth break point of the set. </p> <p>Murray held his serve comfortably, moving to 5-4 with his 21st ace of the match and just one game from reaching his first grand slam final.</p> <p>There was an early stroke of luck for Murray as he won the first point on a net cord that dropped onto the line and when Nadal clipped the net he was able to steal and punch a winner past the world number one.</p> <p>At 40-30, Murray saved game point by winning a superb rally and he earned match point by winning another after coming to the net and putting away a forehand volley. Nadal tried a drop shot that Murray scampered to reach and he sealed victory with a straightforward winner</p> <p>Murray is the first Brit to reach a grand slam final since Greg Rusedski lost to Pat Rafter in the 1997 US Open final. His career record is 2-1 over Federer but the Swiss has won this tournament for the last four years and looked like he was returning to his old formidable self against Novak Djokovic in the other semi-final.</p>",
  "<p><strong>11.15pm</strong> Crumbs. Gadzooks. Phew. Maybe Nadal was blowing? Anyway, the US likes Andy Murray, Andy Murray likes the US. Our first Brit in a grand slam final since 1997, and surely he'll get a massive roar against Federer tomorrow. A well-rested Federer, that is. Ho hum. Another day, another blistering performance, let's hope. That's quite enough dilettanting from me, thanks for the emails, sorry about the ones I couldn't use.</p> <p>Cheerio</p> <p><strong>11.09pm</strong> Wow. I'm a bag of frayed synapses and nerve endings. This from Sunil, moments earlier: \"Does Murray have the intestinal fortitude? It would help if he had a latter-day Lady MacBeth cheering in the stands.\" The Brit in Scot's clothing doesn't need witches on the heath though, not with the tightly-strung wand in his hand. The final point was so understated it was as if Nadal had acquiesced, mesmerised by Murray's ability to stay with his power.</p> <p>Federer in the final then, whom Murray holds a 2-1 record against. Crikey.</p> <p><strong>11.04pm Nadal 4-6 Murray, Murray wins three sets to one!</strong> Nadal is serving to stay in the US Open. How does that sound? A HUGE net cord gives Murray the first point, only for Nadal to serve like Zeus to the back court: 15-15. Another delightful rally - this really is great stuff to watch - and Murray pings one just out; but a second net cord sees the ball then float up in centre for the Scot to put it away for 30-all. Booming service from Nadal for 40-30. Then the crowd oohs and aahs its way through another sumptuous exchange and Murray pulls things back to deuce.</p> <p>Murray hammers Nadal into the blue yonder, and he has nothing to reply with. Match point Murray...He's won!!!</p> <p><strong>10.56pm Nadal 4-5 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> I was tempted to say Nadal looks like he's blowing, but then he sprints right to left and thunders a shot down the line to go 0-15 ahead on the Murray serve. I'll shut up. Murray consolidates though, working his way to 40-15 with some assured shot-making. An ace seals the game. Squeaky bum time?</p> <p><strong>10.53pm Nadal 4-4 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> Another terrific rally, and Nadal holds the first point on his serve. Then Murray nets for 30-0. Murray drills a shot deep, and then comes to the net, forcing Nadal to err. Murray slams another doubleaxe backhand home for 30-30... and Nadal sends his forehand wide. Break point Murray, once more, but we know by now that's nothing against the Spaniard, who saves it. Advantage Nadal. Game Nadal.</p> <p><strong>10.46pm Nadal 3-4 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> This is seeing and sawing more than a kids playground, as Murray takes his service game to love. What an insouciant backhand from the Scot to wrap it up!</p> <p><strong>10.44pm Nadal 3-3 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> In terms of shots, effort, etc, this match is on a phenomenal level, but it's the fine margins that are important here, and Nadal is edging it. The Spaniard takes the first two points, before Murray hits a flat howitzer to the corner for 30-15. Good stuff from Murray, as Nadal is sent tearing left and right, for 30-all. A weak return into the net gives the next point to Nadal, and brings a cry of self-admonishment from Murray; but he's battling all the way here, and we have deuce again.</p> <p>Nadal has Murray where he wants him... only to pat a forehand volley into the net. Advantage Murray, and kudos for chasing everything, but Nadal has saved the last 15 break points in a row. Not this one though!</p> <p><strong>10.37pm Nadal 3-2 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> Nadal is flying here. Murray misses a shocker of a volley, and then Nadal presses the advantage to 0-30. The Scot pulls it back, and a Nadal backhand sails wide - in spite of the challenge - to give Murray 40-30. A splendid first serve and it's game Murray.</p> <p><strong>10.34pm Nadal 3-1 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> \"Murray just lost the US Open right then. He's toast now,\" reckons Sunil. Gah. That certainly wasn't great, if you'll excuse the understatement. Remember, Murray had six break points in the game-but-one previous, and he converted none. It's rapidly 0-30, but Rafa looks up for this, and pounds his way back to 40-30. Murray sends a limp forehand into the net and he has that all-important two-game gap.</p> <p><strong>10.30pm Nadal 2-1 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> The previous game lasted 22 points; this one is 0-40 in seconds. And Nadal only needs one break point! Disaster for Murray.</p> <p><strong>10.26pm Nadal 1-1 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> Nadal to serve. The intensity seems to have dropped a touch - which is pretty understandable, given the start - but Murray is looking good. He <em>absolutely</em> creams a double-handed backhand into the corner, and then benefits from a net cord to go 0-30 up. Sublime rally as both players give it some, but although Murray gets to Nadal's drop, he can't take the point, as the Spaniard hits the open court. Nadal, perhaps feeling the pressure, then screws a horrible forehand well wide of the tramlines... and Murray has two break points. Nadal neutralises one off a solid first serve; and then saves the second with another heavy service.</p> <p>Murray has the advantage, but then sinks a poor backhand into the net: 40-40 again. The Brit/Scot has the ball on a string though, and again brings up advantage... only to mess up from Nadal's second serve. This one's running and running, and Murray again has 'A' next to his name. Nadal serves and volleys, and Murray almost pulls off a superb pass - but Nadal covers his net well. A floated backhand gives Murray a sixth break point, only for him to send it long again! Ad, Murray; deuce. Ad, Nadal; deuce. Ad Nadal; deuce. Ad, Nadal; game, finally, Nadal.</p> <p>The Spaniard's serve got him out of a whole world of trouble, there. That game lasted minutes 15 - and how important will it be in the sum?</p> <p><strong>10.09pm Nadal 0-1 Murray, Murray leads two sets to one</strong> A superb running pass from Nadal gives him 0-15 as we begin the fourth set, and draws a huge cheer from the crowd. As does the point for 0-30. Apparently they just want the game to go the distance. Meh. Britain's Andy Murray (thank you, Richard Clooke) is having none of it though, and pulls level again... only to double fault!!! Ach, nooo. But an ace puts us at deuce again. Nadal, having blasted the hell out of his racquet, changes it - but can't save the game.</p> <p><strong>10.03pm Nadal 6-4 Murray</strong> I can't tell you how grateful I am for these every-two-set breaks! Back to the action, and Nadal is grunting with exertion, fizzing his groundstrokes to the back of the court. Murray looks like he's playing lawn tennis in high summer (which he is, I suppose) - but he takes on Nadal's second serve and squares things at 15-15. A cheeky drop slips into the net, causing a cry of anguish from Murray, but he then steal another point, going toe-to-toe with the 'muscles' Nadal's shot-making.</p> <p>Apparently Nadal is playing twice as well as yesterday already, but Murray's living with him - just. Murray attacks the net and has Nadal scampering for position. It's long, and we have our first deuce. Another long, looping forehand and Murray has the advantage... but an ace (which Murray unsuccessfully challenges) brings them level. Nadal turns it on though, and wraps up his first set. Game on.</p> <p><strong>9.54pm Nadal 5-4 Murray</strong> Murray's serve is on fire, just as it was yesterday, and I can barely draw breath, let alone type... Nadal returned one of those, I think? Game to luuurve.</p> <p><strong>9.52pm Nadal 5-3 Murray</strong> Plenty of noise from the crowd, at the Meadows. Nadal keeps Murray deep before plopping a forehand into the forecourt, as it were. Murray then sends a return into the net. Both players yet to win a point on the other's serve. Not even a flip off the net cord can change that, as Nadal scurries in to deal with the threat and force Murray to play long. The Spaniard then sends one long to make it 40-15... only to smash a thumping serve down the centre which Murray can only send high into the air.</p> <p><strong>9.48pm Nadal 4-3 Murray</strong> Murray screams a forehand cross court, and he's fighting fire with fire here. He serves out to take the game to love as well. What did I say about focus?</p> <p><strong>9.45pm Nadal 4 -2 Murray</strong> Nadal begins in ferocious fashion, booming the ball into Murray's half of the court. An opening point rally is followed by Murray failing to get his return-of-serve in as Nadal coasts to 30-0. Murray looks languid as ever, but he's surely focused for this? Set to love for Nadal though.</p> <p><strong>9.42pm</strong> The commentators seem to be preparing us for a brave Murray defeat, as the two take their ends. Stick with me.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm Confused Scottish battle cry alert</strong> \"Just wanted to point out that Braveheart is on Ch4 at the mo,\" clarion calls Jeremy Gordon-Smith, confusing Rafael Nadal, of Spain, for a cruel and punitive British overlord. \"Can I claim it as an omen for Murray's progression to the final? To be fair, if he plays like he did in the first two sets, he won't need it.\"</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong> It's less humid in the big apple, apparently, so presumably both players will benefit. Rusedski says Murray has to do it in four; Annabel Croft reckons the break will have recharged the sulky Scottish wonderkid. They're out on Ashe, sunlight dappling the court...</p> <p><strong>9.30pm</strong> I lied. Sky's coverage is self-evidently not peerless. But they are here: hurrah! Murray's slept on his two-set lead, I've boned up on my tennis, we've all tuned in for a second helping... let's go! And the first mention of Henman-Ivanisevic will lead to trial by blog for the perpetrator.</p> <p><strong>9.25pm</strong> If I were sitting high above court right now, I would probably paint a picture of crowds streaming to their seats, loaded with snacks and branded beverages; Scottish flags fluttering in the breeze; the players engaging in a little pre-game knockabout. But I'm not so I can't. However, I can tell you that <em>I</em> have butterflies, if that helps. Sky's peerless coverage up next...</p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong> Ah, some pessimism, at last! \"The problem with British players (include national football teams here) is that they are somehow tainted with Britishness,\" cannily observes Al Santhouse. \"My prediction (worth absolutely nothing) - Murray squeaks through against Nadal, followed by a sound, comprehensive and anticlimactic thrashing in the final.\"</p> <p>Richard Clooke, meanwhile, has suggested an image of Willie from the Simpsons for the now-empty author profile pic. Whilst I appreciate the Scot on American soil connotations, as this is being brought to you via the trusty medium of a TV with a coat hanger stuck in the top from the depths of Rebranded Website hq, and - more importantly - I'm not Scottish, I can't accede.</p> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong> Tropical storm Hanna has officially done one, and it's bright and shiny in New Yoik. Greg Rusedski, the last Briton to reach the final of a major, reckons that the rain delay will have helped Nadal, giving him time to \"have a sit down in the locker room to reflect, and speak to his uncle Tony\". But the flip side is that Nadal had picked things up, gaining that break in the third, before the rains came. If Murray starts fresh like he did yesterday, we could all be draped in Saltires before Big Ben strikes ten...</p> <p><strong>8.50pm BST</strong> Apparently we're going to be underway around 9.30pm, or 4.30pm stateside. And rather than returning to the Louis Armstrong, the great Arthur Ashe will be our crucible tonight.</p> <p>In the meantime, here's an update from <a href=\"www.andymurray.com\">www.andymurray.com</a>: \"Andy's in good spirits, and currently eating some fruit in the player lounge!\" Although that may be from yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps more pertinently, some Qs from Gary Naylor: \"Murray rode that wave of adrenaline last night to extraordinary effect - will he still have it tonight? And, if Murray wins, what of tomorrow's final? Will it be played out in front of empty stands? Or will 'pay on the door' ex-pat Scots create a cauldron for Federer to step into?\"</p> <p><strong>8.40pm BST</strong> So, what's Andy 'You Cannot be Serious' McMurray got up his kilt? That must be what Rafael Nadal is wondering right now. Is it a new set of balls, or is he just pleased to be 2-0 ahead? Having lost five from five against the piratas-clad Spaniard, for Murray to even be in the lead seems worthy of high praise - but he will surely regret an opportunity missed if he can't knock the world No1 on the head good'n'proper here. As the rain set in last night above the Louis Armstrong court, there must have been the sense that his best chance had just been washed away: ominously, Nadal has come back from two down thrice, and his record in five setters is 10-3, compared to Murray's 8-4. So, the Scot has to kill this, and quick... but he's a break down in the third already. Dang, this could be good.</p> <p>Anyway, for a little more expert analysis (in both senses), why not let Jon Henderson tell you <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/09/07/scots_aberrant_brilliance_puts.html\">why Murray is on the brink of greatness</a>.</p> <p><strong>Preamble redux</strong> Hallo there, all. Ignore the photo on the left, Lawrence has left the building, and you've got me instead. Please feel free to rate my driving below as is customary, or email witticisms, demands, etc to <a href=\"mailto:alanrgardner@gmail.com\">alanrgardner@gmail.com</a>. And let's hope this is a quick one, for Mama Murray's sake, eh...</p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong> RAIN STOPS PLAY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ON ALL COURTS. Murray versus Nadal will resume tomorrow morning, with the men's final to be played later in the day. Advantage Federer, you would have to say. And if Murray versus Nadal goes to five sets in the morning, then game , set and match to Federer - unless, of course, they hold the final over until Monday.</p> <p><strong>3pm(NY time)</strong> Rain stopped played with Murray two sets up, and Nadal a break up in the third. It is tipping down now. As dear old Bob once sang, you don't need a weatherman etc etc etc...but from where I'm sitting (ie. back in the media centre watching the TV) they're not coming back on court any time soon. There are two ways to look at this; (1) It's bad for Murray because, in the grand scheme of things, he had the momentum. He is also, clearly, much fresher and fitter than the Spaniard and would have had the advantage the longer the match went on. The break gives the Spaniard the chance to catch his breath (figuratively, of course - he's not exactly a tub of lard, after all); or (2) The break is great for Murray because the momentum had swung towards Nadal just before the rain came. Anything to disrupt that unfortunate turns of events is to be welcomed. Murray can go back to the locker room, play his video games and try to remember what won him the first two sets. Here's a clue Andy - 17 aces; 11 forehand winners and 44 outright winners (compared to Nadal's 19). Personally, I can't make my mind up which is right. But I do know this; I need a quick, ahem, personal break. There will be a weather up-date here at 3.30pm (local time)</p> <p><strong>2.43pm</strong> Here comes the rain. The referee wants to stop. Murray's not happy, and who can blame him? It's only spitting, but the sky looks black. They have just asked us to sit in our seats \"momentarily\" while the rain decides whether or not to stop. Murray is absolutely raging and here is why: the officials could have started the match 90 minutes earlier than they did...no that's it..rain stops play.</p> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> There seems to be a some kind of cosmic connection between the wi-fi cnnection and my desire to post copy on this blog. The greater my desire to work, the more miniscule the desire of wi-fi to work. As those of you still working with pigeon post will no doubt know by now, Andy Murray won the second set to lead the match 6-2, 7-6. There was a great deal I wanted to say about that turn of events, much of it relating to the fact that Murray now looked a near certainty to make it into the final, not least because is playing brilliant tennis - in the purely physical sense, but also in a strategic sense. Nadal, on the other hand, looked physically spent. He also looked clueless when it came to countering Murray's change of pace and angles. Not that Im expert but it looked like a walk-over. Our boy... And then he goes and drops his first service in the third set. Ugh. Still, this is no time to get twitchy. 3-2 Nadal, third set.</p> <p><strong>2.18pm</strong> Murray wins the tie-break to go two sets up. Brilliant effort from the scotsman...</p> <p><strong>2.05pm (NY time)</strong> That would be a no... Murray had two (or maybe it was three, I can't remember) break points and couldn't win the game. Credit to Nadal, though. What a battler. Expect Murray to win his serve easily, then we're into the tie break. You'd expect Murray to win that, but then it's Nadal and you never know. I know this, though; if Murray doesn't win this set after playing the Spaniard off the court, thne it is hard to see how he can win the match. Is that being too Scottish and miserable of me? Anyway, the climax is coming. No doubt the wi-fi will take another dive at the crucial moment..</p> <p><strong>2.03pm</strong> 5-5. Murray takes the first point against serve. Has Nadal running all over place..could this be it?</p> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> So far there has been a distinct lack of gratitude evident in the emails, but plenty of ridicule. Gary Naylor writes to upbraid me for failing to spot \" the best set of tennis I have ever seen from a British player in thirty-odd years of watching\". Yes Gary, but it is only one set, dear boy. Those of us who haven't been watching tennis for 30-odd years tend to have our feet on the ground. Sure, it was brilliant but let's get another before we start making grand proclamations. In fact, I'm a bit worried about this second set. Murray has dominated but hasn't managed to get a break. It would be a bit of blow, to say the least, if the Spaniard somehow knicks it. By the way, Nadal leads 5-4...and Federer has just won in four sets next door, apparently.</p> <p><strong>1.43pm</strong> Since you ask about the other game - I can hear a lot of cheering so I'm assuming that means Federer is winning. Did you know that Murray's career record against the world no2 is 2 wins, to one loss?</p> <p><strong>1.40pm</strong>The match has developed a rhythm, in a sense that Murray is holding his serve easily while Nadal is struggling to hold his. For reasons I can't begin to fathom, a picture has just flashed into my head of a bloke in red headband trying to control an umbrella in a force-10 gale. He looks nothing like his usual self. Mind you, he did finally hold his serve to make it 3-2 - although only because Murray hit a couple of rank shots on crucial points, including - agghhh- one of stupid drop shots.</p> <p><strong>1.35pm</strong> I'm sorry, I can't provide a running commentary on every ground stroke, especially with a computer on my lap, a bad wi-fi connection and a fat bloke from Belize crowding my 12-square inches of personal space in the media seating area. What I will say is Murray had a chance to break Nadal in the third game but threw it away with a couple of loose shots. Meanwhile, on the weather front, the expected downpour appears no closer than it was when we started. I'll will refrain from commenting on US forecasters for aother 30 minutes. After all, however, all bets are off. Nadal leads 2-1, second set.</p> <p><strong>1.25pm (NY time)</strong> I notice Tangerinedream has made a snotty remark about this blog being too literal, in a sense that it is providing worthless information such as scoring updates and such like. For this, my humblest apologies and to make up for my terrible, terrible mistake here is some analysis: Murray looks to be on his toes. He has also got a game plan, clearly, which is to keep it in play, mix up the pace and essentially ground-stroke the other guy into submission. Normally, that would never work with Nadal but the Spaniard looks a little tired to me. Meanwhile, Tangerinedream might want to look away at this point - the score is now 1-1 in the second set, Murray leads one set to nil.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm.</strong>Nadal smashes a backhand into the net and it's - are you sitting down? - FIRST SET TO MURRAY. 6-2.</p> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> Murray 5-2. Another break. Our boy (and at this stage in the proceedings I think it's appropriate to call Murray \"our boy\") is playing out of his skin. He's hit 12 winners to Nadal's 4. So much for all that nonsense about him being too defensive.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sam Barritt emails; \"I'm sure you are, you must have been to a few Murray press conferences. Can you tell us the truth? Is he nicer than his on-court demeanour suggests? And being English, can I like him?\" Sam, I'll be honest - I have only ever been to one Andy Murray press conference. I usually do the golf. However, I grew up in Stirling, which isn't far from Dunblane, where Murray grew up. I know the area really well, so I can this without fear of contradiction - he's all right for a bloke from Dunblane. As for being English - of course, you can like him. Not sure he'll like you back, though.</p> <p><strong>12.57pm</strong> More alert readers might have noticed a break in the blog. Not to be too technical, the problem was the bloody wi-fi connection. The Louis Armstrong Stadium has a certain quaint charm but a citadel of high technology it is not. Anyway, we're back and ready to bring you up to date with the latest news, which is...Murray leads 3-1 after breaking Nadal in the third game. Don't ask me how because I was too busy swearing at my computer to pay close attention. Up-date on the news up-date Murray leads 3-2.</p> <p><strong>12.45pm</strong> Nadal 1-0. A decent start by Murray, who won a couple of points against the serve and hit some very nifty top-spin forehands, but Nadal finished him off with an ace. More worryingly, there was a distant clap of thunder just as they changed ends. BY the way, did I say \"rammed\" earlier on? What I meant was \"half full\" - about 2,000 people or so.</p> <p><strong>12.36pm</strong> The secret is well and truly out. At the start of the knock-up there were 200-odd people here, now the place is absolutely rammed. Strange, I know, but I feel a little bit disappointed - I might have had a great story to tell the grandkids (theoretical) about the afternoon I spent in NY with a handful of my closest friends watching the greatest British tennis of the modern era giving the world no1 a hearty beating. Okay, they're ready. The weather isn't any worse than it was 10 minutes ago. Murray won the toss and elected to receive (as he always does, apparently).</p> <p><strong>12.25pm</strong>The players are out. Murray first, then Nadal No offence but if this was a fashion show and not a tennis match the Spaniard is a straight-set winner. Crowd update: the consensus is there are now 225 souls in on the secret. Weather up-date: Hmmmm. Looks ominous.</p> <p>By the way, I meant to say earlier that you can email me at lawrence.donegan@theguardian.com if you need to know something or want to point out some dreadful factual error I've made.</p> <p><strong>12.15pm (NY time)</strong> I've found myself a seat in the Armstrong Stadium and I have to say it wasn't hard. Unless there is a late rush Andy Murray will be playing the biggest match of his life in front of 150 people. This is surreal, although from a spectator point-of-view it is also fantastic. It feels like you're in on a really big secret. What a privilege. Anyway, the players aren't out yet so I think we can discount all that 12.30pm- start nonsense.</p> <p><strong>11.55am(NY time)</strong> This isn't official yet, so if anyone from the USTA asks you didn't hear it from me but the whisper is that Murray versus Nadal will start at 12.30pm local time on the Louis Armstrong Stadium. Federer has won the first set against Djokovic and is playing brilliantly. It looks like he will make it into the final. Who will he play? I'm afraid Im going to have say Nadal in an epic, although I could be wrong because (a) Murray can't keep losing to the Spaniard, can he?; (b) Nadal might be a bit tired after his exertions over the summer; (c) the surface here suits Murray more than the surface anywhere else, and (d) after that shocker in Macedonia Murray probably wants to show the world that not all Scottish sportsmen are hapless numpties.</p> <p><strong>Pre-amble</strong> <strong>11am (NY time)</strong> Good morning from Flushing Meadows, New York, where the temperature gauge is set to \"sauna\". The weather forecast is shocking so don't be surprised if this turns into a blog about the meteorology of the New York metropolitan area before too long. There appears to be some confusion over the timing of the Andy Murray- Rafael Nadal. with the organisers trying to organise their way around the expected downpour. Well...if Moses pulled it off, then maybe the US Tennis Association can, too. If the forecast is correct, there is about as much chance of the match being completed today as is there is of me returning one of Nadal's ground strokes. If it's wrong, then we could be in for a beauty. Murray's career record against the Spaniard is 0-5 but he stands a decent chance of winning this one, for all kinds of reasons. If you join me again in half-an-hour, I will provide you with a list of these reason. Oh yes, I might also have an up-date on the starting time for the match.</p>",
  "<p>Toby Flood scored an interception try and kicked eight points on his Leicester debut to give the Tigers a winning start to their Guinness Premiership season against Gloucester at Kingsholm. Earlier in the day, Sale began with victory away to Newcastle, while fly-half Butch James helped Bath to beat Bristol in a high-scoring game.</p> <p>In last season's Premiership play-offs, Gloucester had succumbed to Leicester's power, and the same was to be the case today. Both teams struggled for fluency following the summer break - and they could not even hide behind the contentious experimental law variations as an excuse. The Tigers' new coach, South African Heyneke Meyer, eventually saw his team prevail in an error-strewn tussle thanks to late tries from Geordan Murphy and Flood</p> <p>Flood and opposite number Ryan Lamb missed seven shots at goal between them, although Lamb's solitary successful strike before he was substituted 18 minutes from time looked to have made the difference, with Gloucester 8-6 ahead before Murphy struck. In the first half, Gloucester full-back Olly Morgan, comfortably the best player on view, had scored his team's solitary try just two minutes after Leicester flanker Ben Herring was yellow-carded.</p> <p>And Morgan, who won England honours under Brian Ashton's coaching regime, also produced a solid defensive display, highlighted through a crunching tackle on blockbusting Leicester wing Alesana Tuilagi. But Leicester were streetwise when it mattered, expertly closing the game out as suffocating pressure forced the mistake from which Flood prospered.</p> <p>In the north east, Matthew Tait enjoyed a triumphant return to his former club as Sale squeezed out Newcastle. An early try from Charlie Hodgson gave the Sharks the advantage, and former All Black Luke McAlister did the rest with the boot to secure victory, despite two penalties and a drop goal from Newcastle youngster Rory Clegg.</p> <p>In the west country derby, Bath triumphed over Bristol, scoring three tries to two as South African stand-off James kicked 18 points for their first Premiership victory at the Memorial Stadium since March 1998.

But number eight Jonny Fa'amatuainu finished from 30 metres for the fifth try of the game as Bath stretched away after the break.</p>",

  "<p>The story's ingredients were a tabloid editors' wet dream, and the plot seemed to have been lifted straight out of one of the lurid soap operas that glue Egyptians to their TV sets every Ramadan. The sultry young pop star with a troubled past, the real-estate mogul with close links to the president, and a gruesome murder in a Dubai apartment \u2013 this was a drama of glamour, money and betrayal played out by synthetic people in a synthetic world, a million miles away from the lives of ordinary Egyptians.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7593906.stm\">brutal killing</a> of Lebanese diva <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Tamim\">Suzanne Tamim</a> and the subsequent arrest of Egyptian property tycoon <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham_Talaat_Moustafa\">Hisham Talaat Moustafa</a> on murder charges was very real, and shockwaves are already being felt in the corridors of power. Moustafa is a high-ranking government insider, a member of the ruling National Democratic party's \"supreme policies council\" and a personal friend of President Hosni Mubarak, whose regime has become notorious for its close links with rich businessmen.</p> <p>Tamim was a 30-year-old <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybjGGuMwHvY&amp;feature=related\">singer</a> from Beirut who rose to fame after appearing on a Lebanese talent show in the mid-1990s. Renowned by many for her beauty and her voice \u2013 which could tackle modern pop and classical Arabic melodies with equal finesse \u2013 Tamim's star rose and then waned as troubles in her personal life escalated. A failed marriage to her manager led her to flee to Cairo and by last year she had faded completely from public view. The name of this once bright young talent was only hauled back from obscurity in June, when her body was found with multiple stab wounds at one of her homes in Dubai. The Arab world was quickly gripped by the murder and Tamim's face stared out of newspaper front pages for weeks on end \u2013 except in Egypt, where a judicial ban on media discussion of the case was imposed after a leading opposition paper claimed that a prominent business figure from the government's inner circle was being investigated for homicide.</p> <p>The attempted information blackout finally collapsed this week when it <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16195\">emerged</a> that Moustafa, said by local newspapers to be a former lover of Tamim's, had been arrested in Egypt in connection with the crime. Prosecutors allege that he paid a former police officer, Mohsen el-Sukkari, $2m to follow Tamim from Egypt to London and finally on to Dubai, where he tricked his way into her house and fatally attacked her. Both men could now face the death penalty.</p> <p>The twists and turns of Tamim's demise are the subject of endless discussion on the streets of Cairo, but talk of this tragedy goes well beyond the sphere of celebrity gossip. Firstly, the domestic media ban on reporting details of the case proved to be the latest hamfisted attempt by the Egyptian government to control the increasingly vociferous independent newspaper sector. Like other attempts before it to apply stale methods of state censorship to a globalised media environment, the ban only served to heighten interest in what was going on. The previous week taping of a programme featuring democracy activists that was being recorded for American satellite channel al-Hurra was summarily <a href=\"http://menassat.com/?q=en/alerts/4506-egypt-two-al-hurra-programs-democracy-stopped\">cancelled</a> by the authorities; the week before that, allegations of government deceit in the events surrounding the Egyptian parliament fire were prevented from hitting the streets when the government-owned printing presses halted production of an independent newspaper.</p> <p>News emerged recently that internet cafes will soon be forced to log the <a href=\"http://www.anhri.net/en/reports/2008/pr0809.shtml\">personal details</a> of all their users, whilst a draft law creating a new code of \"media ethics\" has been <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2008/08/20088791952617974.html\">dismissed</a> by human rights organisations as a naked bid to strangle the burgeoning pro-democracy movement.</p> <p>The problem for the government is that after permitting a small degree of freedom into the previously monolithic state-dominated Egyptian media world, it is struggling to get the cat back into the bag as rising discontent at economic hardship and the lack of political reform finds a voice in the new wave of news outlets. The regime is resorting to old-fashioned legal bullying to try and manipulate the information reaching its citizens, but as the Tamim story shows they are doomed to failure. Even as al-Dostour, the paper that originally claimed an NDP bigwig was connected with the murder, was being pulled from newsstands, other pan-Arab newspapers featuring all the gory details \u2013 many printed as far afield as London - were flying in to Cairo. And while the staff of Al-Dostour were being <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15723\">grilled</a> by security officers, <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/09/03/egypt-tycoon-arrested-in-singers-murder-2/\">bloggers</a> were spreading the identity of Tamim's alleged murderer on the web, along with detailed updates on al-Dostour's expurgation from the streets. Just like repressive regimes the world over, Egypt's political elite are finding it increasingly difficult to restrict the flow of facts they find uncomfortable.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly though, the really shocking detail to surface from Tamim's death wasn't that a prominent businessman had been linked to her murder, but that the government had actually arrested the man in question and even stripped him of his parliamentary immunity (Moustafa sat in the Shura council, the upper house of Egypt's parliament). I have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/egypt.middleeast\">written here before</a> of the series of corruption scandals that have rocked the NDP and fuelled widespread scorn at the government's intimacy with the business world \u2013 a self-serving alliance strengthened by the current prime minister's aggressive neoliberal economic reforms, which have earned <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/825/eg2.htm\">plaudits</a> from the World Bank but sent inflation spiralling and widened the <br><a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-05-04-as-mubarak-turns-80-egypt-faces-inflation-unrest\">chasm</a> between rich and poor in this vastly unequal society. The level of government protection afforded to the moneyed elite is so great that Egyptians have grown wearily familiar of the corruption bandwagon, which always seems to end in acquittal for the accused and the resumption of business as usual. \"As long as businessmen remain the backbone of the NDP, these scandals will continue,\" insists the editor of Nasserist newspaper al-Arabi.</p> <p>So what to make of Moustafa's very public arrest for Tamim's killing, which sent shares in his vast business empire, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2008/09/03/moustafa-tamim-egypt-face-markets-cx_dp_0903autofacescan04.html\">TMG Holdings</a>, into freefall? Will there be the predictable rigged trial before the charges are dropped, or is the judicial energy expended on the case a sign that something fundamental has changed within this increasingly defensive governing clique? \"Moustafa's indictment is clear evidence that the ruling party knows no cronyism and that nobody in Egypt is above the law\", declared the NDP's secretary for media affairs grandly. The rapidity with which Moustafa was stripped of parliamentary immunity also took opposition politicians by surprise, with many acknowledging that the NDP seemed to be trying to improve its image.</p> <p>But anybody who believes the government is really looking to shake off its reputation as the party of business is deluding themselves. Mubarak's coalition of political interests sustains itself through money, a ruling class that enjoys no popular legitimacy but survives by keeping the country's most powerful economic forces in its inner circle, spreading around to them the cash generated by privatisation, the sale of assets to foreign multinationals and the slow dismantling of the welfare state. Cronyism may make it unpopular on the streets, but regardless of what happens to Moustafa the government cannot afford to abandon its wealthy friends.</p> <p>Amidst all of the political and economic pyrotechnics in the wake of Tamim's death, it would be easy to forget that this too was a very human tragedy. Tamim was <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/667/eg6.htm\">not the first</a> Arabic female pop star who ended up dead after suffering from abusive partners and a restless private life, and given the <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/09/middle-east-the.html\">exploitative relationships</a> which dominate the music industry here, she may not be the last.</p> <p>For the government, however, the real drama lies in the public response to her murder and the growing cynicism on the streets at clumsy media manipulation and the legal sheltering of the president's business allies. It is a story set to be as equally dramatic as the sultry pop singer, the real-estate mogul, and the gruesome murder in a Dubai apartment.</p>",
  "<p>Once again, Britain trade unions can help save \u2013 or help destroy \u2013 Labour as a party fit for government. In the 1930s, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bevin\">Ernest Bevin</a> saved the Labour party from wandering off into the irrelevance of non-intervention in Spain and thinking that a peace pledge petition would stop Hitler from annexing German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Bevin, after 1945, dragged Labour away from a fatal embrace with Stalinism and, instead, created Nato, the Marshall plan, and despite being howled down by the left at the Labour party conference because union demands for inflationary pay rises could not be met, he kept Labour as a mainstream party fit for power.</p> <p>In contrast, the roaring TUC denunciations of Jim Callaghan's government in the 1970s, and the unleashing of the winter of discontent in 1978-79, helped bring back the Tories. The TUC's language in the early 1980s \u2013 anti-Europe, anti-America, anti-economic reform, anti-everything \u2013 helped hand Thatcher her victories in 1983 and 1987.</p> <p>Fast forward to the late 1980s and early 1990s and brave union leaders like Bill Morris, Bill Jordan and John Monks took Labour out of the clutches of Scargillism, or of those who claimed that bringing Japanese car factories to the north east meant importing \"alien practices\" (called jobs) to the UK. Former Communist leaders of genius like the AEU's Jimmy Airlie understood it was time to park the militant rhetoric of denunciation of Labour and, instead, forge a new alliance with reformist, modernising Blair-Brown politics.</p> <p>Again, its was the trade union leaders who saved Labour, broke the back of Stalinist control and Trotskyist infiltration of trade unions and local Labour party organisation.</p> <p>Today, the Tories are coming back, the BNP is growing, but some TUC leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/labourleadership.ordonbrown&quot;\">reserve their fire</a> for Labour. This is forward to the past. Not to the past of an Ernie Bevin, or the Morris-Monks-Jordan alliance, which helped defeat the Tories, but to the past of the 1970s and early 1980s, in which Labour was denounced by trade unions. Trade union leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/tradeunions.labour\">are queuing up</a> to dig the grave of a Labour government.</p> <p>This is possibly the last TUC congress before a general election, and certainly the last but one before an election in 2010. This might be the moment to celebrate the massive reallocation of resources under Labour in favour of working people, which has seen not only 900,000 more workers join the public sector, but also British industry take a bigger share of GDP than industry in France. Plus a raft of social justice measures from the minimum wage to five weeks' paid holiday and every ministry with open doors to trade union delegations.</p> <p>But no. The language is full of hate and anger. Derek Simpson, the Unite joint leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/tradeunions.labour\">even tells</a> the Observer, \"We might as well elect Cameron.\" Did I read that right? It was in the midst of a stream of abuse against David Miliband. In Moscow, Miliband is denounced as a \"Jew\". For Simpson, he is \"smug\" and \"arrogant\".</p> <p>As far as I know, poor Mr Miliband has not said a word about unions in recent times, though \u2013 unlike Tory foreign secretaries \u2013 he has invited TUC leaders to dinner and gone to see them at Congress House.</p> <p>It is not clear what provoked Simpson's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Vyshinsky \">Vyshinsky</a>-style abuse against our foreign secretary. But for a senior labour movement leader, this use of language about one of our top ministers is worrying and serious. David Miliband <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jFj5byJOCsrma8hRzhkSa-RrY6VA \">is engaged</a> in serious international business at the moment over Russia's invasion and part-annexation of Georgia as well as difficulties in Pakistan and the anger of Kashmiris in the Indian-occupied part of Kashmir. There is a tricky UN general assembly to deal with.</p> <p>When Ernest Bevin was seeking to promote a post 1945 settlement based on Labour values, he told conference delegates not \"to stab me in the back\".</p> <p>Miliband would be foolish to rise to Simpson's abuse; the quickest way Labour can lose the next election is to indulge in this kind of name-calling at the highest level. It makes Labour look quarrelsome, riven by personality conflicts, and obsessed with itself. It is a one-way ticket to defeat and oblivion \u2013 and TUC leaders should not be punching it.</p> <p>Every Labour MP and union branch official knows the difficulties our people are going through. I spent time with union branch officials at my local hospital last week, and three of them said the problem was there were too many foreigners or immigrants in Rotherham. Not true, but a shudder of fear and cold went through my heart that union representatives could use this BNP language. We had a friendly talk and I hope I persuaded them that Britain has been made by different people from different regions with different religions and different tongues coming to live here.</p> <p>But then I switched on the BBC R4 news on Saturday night and a woman union leader was ranting with hate against energy companies. As it happens, there is a good case for a windfall tax and it got Gordon Brown's chancellorship off to a cracking start in 1997. The Tories imposed windfall taxes and President Sarkozy has just imposed a tax on unearned income for France's middle classes in order to pay for his version of the working families tax credit.</p> <p>But the case will be made not with roaring student union rhetoric and abuse of companies, but by the kind of rational expose advanced by the Tory-controlled Local Government Association. Every MP, every union official and every citizen has his or her ideas of what the government should do. The call is for change \u2013 as if there were off-the-shelf policies that could stop the global economic crisis of rising costs of fuel, food and credit, which is hitting every democratic nation hard. But an honest union leadership would have to explain, as did an earlier generation of union leaders who helped Labour defeat the Tories that, with the state taking 45% of the GDP in revenue and with massive commitment to pay for extra teachers, nurses, public service delivery and still keep taxes at a level that does not produce voter revolt, the room for Labour's manoeuvre is limited. But where are the calm voices of reason to be heard at the TUC?</p> <p>Unions in Britain, in Europe, in North America, everywhere, are losing members as they continue structures, organisation and leadership based on 20th-century industrial society models. They are more than ever needed, as capitalism explodes across the planet at a speed far ahead of that which society and politics can keep up with.</p> <p>But unions need a government that at least is prepared to listen to them. Right now, too much of the rhetoric at the TUC puts Labour up as the main enemy to be defeated. Abuse of the foreign secretary \u2013 or any minister and the prime minister \u2013 is Christmas squared to the Tories (as they cheerfully admit). In the past, trade unions helped save Labour. Today, they appear to want to bury the party they founded.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Garton_Ash\">Timothy Garton Ash</a> was one of the most articulate and influential advocates of \"liberal interventionism\" and so his effective <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/russia.eu\">recantation</a> of the doctrine yesterday should not go unremarked. In a subtle re-branding exercise he declared instead for \"liberal internationalism\", which he defined in the following way.</p> <blockquote> <p>Liberal internationalism does not mean marching into other people's countries and telling the locals what's good for them down the barrel of a gun. It means developing a set of norms and rules by which most states will abide, preferably made explicit in international law and sustained by international organisations. It posits some basic rights that belong to every human being on this planet, whatever her or his \"culture\", circumstances or rulers. It aims to strike a balance between the universal and the particular. It seeks to build peace between nations on these foundations. </p> </blockquote> <p>Now contrast that with what he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/14/davidmiliband.eu\">described</a> at the time as an \"<a href=\"http://www.davidmiliband.info/speeches/speeches_08_02.htm\">excellent speech</a>\" by David Miliband from earlier this year in which the foreign secretary said:</p> <blockquote> <p>... in the 1990s, something strange happened. The neoconservative movement seemed to be most sure about spreading democracy around the world. The left seemed conflicted between the desirability of the goal and its qualms about the use of military means. In fact, the goal of spreading democracy should be a great progressive project; the means need to combine soft and hard power. We should not let the genuine debate about the 'how' of foreign policy obscure the clarity about the 'what'. </p> </blockquote> <p>And back to Garton Ash yesterday:</p> <blockquote> <p>The essence of our new European way of doing things is something more like procedural integrity. The frontiers of existing states must be respected, but in exceptional cases territories within states may negotiate special autonomies or even vote to become independent, like Slovakia and Kosovo, or perhaps Scotland one day - but always by peaceful means, by negotiation and consent, with the sanction of national and international law. The how matters even more than the what. </p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds pretty much like boring old-fashioned diplomacy to me. We already have a set of rules and norms by which most states will abide; it is called international law and one of the many reasons why the invasion of Iraq was wrong was that it violated this. At the time of the Iraq war, on 20 March 2003, Garton Ash was praising Blair's \"magnificent speech to the British Parliament\" and <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7DB1031F933A15750C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1\">enthusing</a> that he was \"totally convinced that the Blairite vision of a new post-war order of world politics is the best one on the market\". Yet yesterday he mocked the \"characteristic incompetence\" of Bush's foreign policy towards Georgia (\"don't invade a sovereign country \u2013 that's what we do\").</p> <p>Interestingly, Garton Ash also quite pointedly did not support calls for Georgia and Ukraine to be brought into Nato \u2013 offering them EU membership instead. He confessed that \"Europe is not good at doing stuff with tanks. But we do a thousand other things, each smaller, softer and slower than a tank\". This is quite a climb-down from even a year ago when he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/26/comment.labour\">praising</a> the strength and decisiveness of Blair's foreign policy.</p> <p>In many ways the evolution of Garton Ash's thinking is probably a barometer of a wider mood swing among the liberal left. He supported military intervention in Kosovo without a UN mandate and was an enthusiast for the development of the \"responsibility to protect\" concept. He has railed against international inaction in Darfur, yet after the Burmese cyclone this May he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/22/burma.cyclonenargis\">concluded</a> that \"the responsibility to protect has to be exercised responsibly\" and that ruled out western military action without a UN mandate.</p> <p>The initial impetus for liberal interventionism came from a genuine belief that \"something must be done\" to help people suffering in far-off countries, but it fitted into a wider political narrative by which a section of the liberal left came to identify themselves. The humanitarian crises of the 1990s coincided with an intellectual crisis of confidence on the left which left many flailing around for something else to believe in. Blair, the humanitarian war leader, convinced them that, even as they gave up on the radical transformation of British society, there was a wider stage on which to play out their political vanguardism. It has taken two bloody conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan to shatter these illusions, but judging by Garton Ash's article we can finally conclude that liberal interventionism is dead and buried. </p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/pakistan.zardari\">Asif Ali Zardari</a> \u2013 singled out by fate to become Benazir Bhutto's husband and who, subsequently, did everything he could to prevent himself from being returned to obscurity \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/07/pakistan.zardari.election\">is about to become</a> the new President of Pakistan. Oily-mouthed hangers-on, never in short supply in Pakistan, will orchestrate a few celebratory shows and the ready tongues of old cronies (some now appointed ambassadors to western capitals) will speak of how democracy has been enhanced. Zardari's close circle of friends, with whom he shared the spoils of power the last time around and who have remained loyal, refusing all inducements to turn state's evidence in the corrruption cases against him, will also be delighted. Small wonder then that definitions of democracy in Pakistan differ from person to person.<br>There will be no expressions of joy on the streets to mark <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/pakistan\">the transference of power</a> from a moth-eaten general to a worm-eaten politician. The affection felt in some quarters for the Bhutto family is non-transferable. If Benazir were still alive, Zardari would not have been given any official post. She had been considering two other senior politicians for the presidency. Had she been more democratically inclined she would never have treated her political party so scornfully, reducing it to the status of a family heirloom, bequeathed to her son, with her husband as the regent till the boy came of age. </p> <p>This, and this alone, has aided Zardari's rise to the top. He was disliked by many of his wife's closest supporters in the People's Party (or the Bhutto Family Party, as it is referred to by disaffected members) even when she was alive. They blamed his greed and godfatherish behaviour to explain her fall from power on two previous occasions, which I always thought was slightly unfair. She knew. It was a joint enterprise. She was never one to regard politics alone as the consuming passion of her life and always envied the lifestyle and social behaviour of the very rich. And he was shameless in his endeavours to achieve that status. </p> <p>Today, he is the second richest person in the country, with estates and bank accounts littered on many continents, including a mansion in Surrey worth several million. Many of Benazir's inner circle, sidelined by the new boss (Zardari did rub their noses in excrement by having his apolitical sister elected from Larkana, hitherto a pocket borough of the Bhutto family) actively hate him. Benazir's uncle, Mumtaz Bhutto (head of the clan) has sharply denounced him. Some even encourage the grotesque view that he was in some way responsible for her death. This is foolish. He is only trying to fulfill her legacy. He was certainly charged with ordering the murder of his brother-in-law, Murtaza Bhutto, when Benazir was prime minister, but the case was never tried. Characteristically, one of Zardari's first acts after his party's victory in the February polls was to appoint <a href=\"http://www.pakspectator.com/who-is-dr-shoaib-suddle-and-tariq-lodhi/\">Shoaib Suddle</a>, the senior police officer connected to the Murtaza Bhutto ambush and killing, as the boss of the Federal Intelligence Agency. Loyalty is always repaid in full. </p> <p>In the country at large, his standing, always low, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/pakistan1\">has sunk still further</a>. The majority of Pakistan's 190 million citizens may be poor, illiterate or semi-literate, but their instincts are usually sound. An opinion poll carried out by the <a href=\"http://www.newamerica.net/issues/keywords/pakistan\">New America Foundation</a> some months ago revealed Zardari's approval ratings at a low ebb \u2013 less than 14%. These figures confirm the view that he is the worst possible slice of Pakistan's crumbly nationhood. The people has had no say in his election. parliamentary cabals have already determined the result. I do not take too seriously the recent revelation that a psychiatrist had pronounced him suffering from acute dementia, incapable of recognising his children due to a chronic loss of memory. This was, as is known, designed for the courtroom had he been prosecuted in London or Geneva for large-scale money-laundering and corruption. All that is in abeyance now, since he has been elevated into a crucial figure in the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>A small mystery remained. Why did the US suddenly withdraw support from General Musharraf? An answer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/washington/26diplo.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Helene%20Cooper%20and%20Mark%20Mazzetti&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">was provided</a> on August 26 by Helene Cooper and Mark Mazzetti in the New York Times. The State Department, according to this report, was not in favour of an undignified and hasty departure, but unknown to them a hardcore neocon faction led by Zalmay Khalilzad, the US ambassador to the Security Council, was busy advising Asif Zardari in secret and helping him plan the campaign to oust the general:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Mr Khalilzad had spoken by telephone with Mr Zardari, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples party, several times a week for the past month until he was confronted about the unauthorised contacts, a senior United States official said, \"Can I ask what sort of 'advice and help' you are providing?\" \u2026 Mr. Boucher wrote in an angry email message to Mr Khalilzad. \"What sort of channel is this? Governmental, private, personal?\" Copies of the message were sent to others at the highest levels of the State Department; the message was provided to the New York Times by an administration official who had received a copy.\" </p> </blockquote> <p><br> Khalilzad is an inveterate factionalist and a master of intrigue. Having implanted Hamid Karzai in Kabul (with dire results as many in Washington now admit), he had been livid with Musharraf for refusing to give 100% support to his Afghan protege. Khalilzad now saw an opportunity to punish Musharraf and simultaneously try and create a Pakistani equivalent of Karzai. </p> <p>Zardari fitted the bill. He is perfectly suited to being a total creature of Washington. The Swiss government helpfully decided to release millions of dollars from Zardari's bank accounts that had, till now, been frozen due to the pending corruption cases. Like his late wife, Zardari, too, is now being laundered, just like the money he made when last in office as minister for investment. This weakness will make him a pliant president of Pakistan. </p> <p>The majority of the population is deeply hostile to the US/Nato presence in Afghanistan. Almost 80% favour a negotiated settlement and withdrawal of all foreign troops. Three days ago, a team of US commandos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/pakistan.usa\">entered Pakistan</a> \"in search of terrorists\" and 20 innocents were killed. Zardari was being tested. But if he permits US troops to enter the frontier province on \"search-and-destroy\" missions his career will be short-lived and the military will return in some shape or form. The High Command cannot afford to ignore the growing anger within its junior ranks at being forced to kill their own people.</p> <p>The president of Pakistan was designed in the 1972 constitution as an ornamental figure. Military dictators subverted and altered the constitution to their advantage. Will Zardari revert to his late father-in-law's constitution or preserve its existing powers? </p> <p>The country desperately needs a president capable of exercizing some moral authority and serving as the conscience of the country. The banished chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, automatically comes to mind, as do the figures of Imran Khan and IA Rehman (the chairman of the Human Rights Commission), but the governing elite and its self-serving backers in Washington have always been blind to the real needs of this country. They should be careful. The sparks flying across the Afghan border might ignite a fire that is difficult to control.</p> <p><em>Tariq Ali's latest book, The Duel: Pakistan on the Flightpath of American Power, will be published by Simon and Schuster on September 15</em></p>"
