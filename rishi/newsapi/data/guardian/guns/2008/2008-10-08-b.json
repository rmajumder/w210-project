  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain's</a> campaign - even according to his supporters - is running into trouble. Most polls have him trailing <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> by significant margins. Here the Guardian asks top US commentators whether the race is now over or whether he can pull off a remarkable comeback.</p> <h2>Frank Luntz<br>Republican pollster and consultant</h2> <p>\"He hasn't lost it, but it is slipping away. He will need a brilliant debate performance next week or it will be too late. McCain has realised that he needs to fight. He has just forgotten who he is fighting for. It's not a fight against Obama. He should be fighting for the hard-working taxpayer and it doesn't come across that way. He is demonstrating the difference in his policy but he should be demonstrating why he is better for hard-working, middle-class taxpayers ... The way the media works, the way the economy is coming apart, the only chance for McCain is when everybody is watching.\"</p> <h2>David Johnson<br>Republican strategist<br>Worked on Bob Dole's campaign in 1996</h2> <p>\"If the election were held today, yeah, he's toast. John McCain isn't able to make a dent. People have tuned him out. That's also beginning to seep down to your rank-and-file Republicans, and panic is beginning to set in. He needs to change his message. John McCain needs to get in front of a camera and say: 'I'm not as polished and not as charismatic as my opponent, but we're facing an economic crisis. We need leadership and this is my plan.' Like Churchill ... he needs to make America understand that he's going to roll up his sleeves and he's not going to stop until he's got victory.\"</p> <h2>Elaine Kamarck<br>White House aide to Bill Clinton and Democratic superdelegate<br>Kennedy School of Government</h2> <p>\"We know historically that when people are concerned about their pocket books they turn to the Democratic party. It doesn't look like this economic crisis is going to go away. John McCain is fighting an uphill battle, historically. He made a very good start last night, which nobody paid attention to, which is this proposal on foreclosures. He's got two or three weeks to somehow overcome the prejudice among the voters that the Republicans are somehow responsible for this and that they're not the ones to handle this. It's a tall order, because this is not something that comes naturally to him ... He's got two options: he can try to change the conversation, which is extremely difficult given the severity of the financial crisis, or he can try to compete on the economic front.\"</p> <h2>Stephen Hess<br>Brookings Institution<br>Worked for presidents from Eisenhower to Carter</h2> <p>\"If McCain were to win this election I think it would truly be the biggest upset in American political history, and I say that not as a partisan but as a political historian ... It's as if Herbert Hoover would have won in 1932. I don't think you can have an economic situation this bad, and not expect to throw out the in party ... By now much of it is set in concrete as far as the fundamentals.\"</p> <h2>Matt Bennett<br>Co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic thinktank</h2> <p>\"I would say that he's in intensive care but not quite in hospice at the moment. He's definitely not finished, we're just too far out, and this race has lurched too quickly from one side to the other. But there's no question that he better turn it around fast. I don't know that there's anything he can do that's within his control. The reason he's not finished is not because he could pull something out of his hat, but because there could be [external] events that could save his campaign. He's just not a skilled enough campaigner and he's in such a tight spot that there's no magic bullet he could fire. He needs to hope for something else to save him.\"</p> <h2>David Yepsen<br>Political columnist, The Des Moines Register</h2> <p>\"No, he is not finished. It is still doable for McCain, and there is just under a month to the election ... But he has got to talk about specific solutions on the economy. There are also two wild cards in this race. One is race: how many people can't vote for Obama because of his race. We know it's out there, but people don't like to talk about it and it's difficult to measure. The other wild card is voters under 25, the millennials. There are huge registration numbers out there. The challenge will be to produce those young people. It's one thing to sign them up. It's another to turn them out.\"</p> <h2>James Antle<br>Associate editor of the American Spectator</h2> <p>\"John McCain almost did the impossible: for a period after the Republican convention it looked like he might extend his party's grip on the White House for another four years. Independent voters liked him, conservatives loved Sarah Palin. The Democrats seemed utterly unprepared for this strange turn of events. And then came the financial meltdown. McCain - to paraphrase Sam Cooke - don't know much about the economy. Democrats are made to campaign in times like these. The only remaining advantage for McCain is that he has kept the race just close enough to benefit from any last-minute blunder by Barack Obama. McCain has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate. But his luck looks like it has run out.\"</p> <h2>David Gergen<br>Former White House adviser to Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton</h2> <p>\"The issue of race is still rearing its head in this campaign and we don't know how that it is going to play out. This has been such a volatile campaign and the issue of race has been so unresolved that I don't think you can say with any confidence Obama is going to win. The Obama people are not acting as if they are confident ... If I were John McCain I would go into a meeting with the best economic minds in the country and determine where the economy is going and where they can go to cope with this crisis, and give a speech on the economy Monday and Tuesday of next week and take that into the next debate.\"</p> <h2>Anne Hallum<br>Political science professor at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida</h2> <p>\"I don't think he's lost the election, at least from Florida's standpoint, because it is only three points apart, but favouring Obama. I have memories of 2000, when Gore lost by only 537 votes. He's in a tough spot, because he's running against his own party. But Americans are tired of the negative attacks. That's why these first early polls are showing Obama won [the debate last night] because McCain was so negative. It's standard for the person who's behind to be negative. For McCain to turn this around he's got to be positive, stay on point, stay clear with his policy statements ... The odds are against McCain, except that Obama is counting on 18- to 24-year-olds, who aren't reliable.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pipe Mania is much as it ever was on the Amiga, a manic puzzler that's arguably just as addictive as Tetris. At first glance, not much has changed; as the liquid flows, you build a pipeline to carry it - easy at first, but soon a frantic test of logic and thumb control. And over the 300+ levels and seven themed worlds, other improvements emerge - leak-tanks and reservoirs to use to your advantage, rival plumbers to get in your way or add an occasional helping hand. Pipe Mania won't win any prizes for looks and the soundtrack's incredibly annoying, but it's charming retro fun and the PSP's easily the best handheld version.</p>",
  "<p>FIFA '09 is the closest edition yet to replicating the fluid action seen in arch rival Pro Evolution Soccer (PES). It's not quite there - the players still don't feel quite as responsive as they do in PES - but the difference is far less marked than before. And when it comes to heading, FIFA wins out, with players having much more control on where they place their header. The game looks the part, too, with players pointing where they want the pass and the bigger-name players running in the style of their real-life counterparts. Up close, though, the players still look like freakish zombies. And get out of the top leagues and likenesses go out the window. There are plenty of new features - 10 versus 10 online, with each gamer playing as one player, and a season update that adds real-life form data to the game are the highlights. And, unlike PES, online play is relatively lag free. PES still wins on the pitch but as an overall package FIFA '09 is hard to beat.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past year, Forbes, the American magazine that preens itself as \"The Capitalist Tool\", has been publishing a series of special issues on the world's most valuable sports properties, in baseball, ice hockey and footballs (various). The last, published two weeks ago, contained the usual selection of eye-popping figures about the NFL: for example, that the average team is valued at $1bn (\u00a3576m), 19 teams being worth more, compared with just five last year and none five years ago.</p> <p>Did I say is valued? I meant was. For in years to come, these magazines may not be unlike the Lehman Brothers caps and Fannie Mae fridge magnets now selling on eBay: a reminder of the good old days, when credit was cheap, assets only increased in value, and corporate largesse was unending.</p> <p>An even more pointed reminder of changed circumstances, of course, is the AIG symbol sported, doubtless with some chagrin, by Manchester United, worth \u00a314m a year to the club when the deal was done 30 months ago, but now as ignominiously conspicuous as wearing the logo of the White Star Line in April 1912, or perhaps mouthing a slogan for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin in May 1937: \"You'll always travel F\u00fchrer class on the Hindenburg!\"</p> <p>Man Utd will cope. Others may not be so lucky. The G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung on Wall Street has demonstrated that when asset values rise significantly and over a long period, a misapprehension grows among investors that they will rise indefinitely, that everyone will get rich, and that everyone involved is a genius.</p> <p>How closely, I wonder, does this also apply to the business of sport? Big-time sport has enjoyed the sort of revenue growth over the last 20 years that in an athlete would suggest a steroid or illegal hormone: they have also marbled in huge fixed costs, as expenditure has risen to meet then outstrip income, with the assumption that future growth will somehow make it all work.</p> <p>Sport got a glimpse of what a major financial reckoning might look like six years ago. The collapses within a month of the German media group, Kirch Gruppe, and ITV Digital brought hard times and austerities to the Bundesliga and the Football League, depriving clubs of the broadcasting bounty to which they had grown accustomed.</p> <p>Present circumstances hit clubs and leagues at a more prosaic and localised level. About a quarter of the $10bn in sponsorship monies ploughed into sport comes from the financial-services sector. That includes the Premier League's support from Barclays, English cricket's alliance with NatWest and the London Olympics' fat handout from Lloyds TSB. Who would want to be hustling at the moment? Expect instead injunctions to do more with less. Doves for the opening ceremony? Wouldn't pigeons do the job?</p> <p>During its gilded age sport has also comprehensively thrown in its lot with the high-end consumers now likeliest to change their short-term spending habits. After all, who can enjoy a football match in a \u00a3500 seat if one's broker is constantly plaguing one with margin calls, and the bailiff might in between times have repossessed one's Merc? Particularly worrying is that it is usually the most leveraged and ostentatious fortunes that are most vulnerable: after all, even oligarchs lose money.</p> <p>Part of the dread pervading securities markets at present is the sheer unfamiliarity of the dilemma. The bull market in stocks is usually deemed to have run since August 1982. You need to be in your late forties to recall a protracted downturn, and in your late fifties to have experienced anything like this kind of confusion and desperation.</p> <p>That is even more the case in sport, whose management is the province of youthful enthusiasts with sports-marketing degrees and iPhones who scatter their conversation with quotes from Jerry Maguire. What will they make of a downturn? Which among them will know how to eliminate discretionary costs and to winnow away fixed ones? Above all, how many athletes have had to come to terms with being worth considerably less than they were a year earlier without a serious deterioration in their playing abilities? For it would be a brave man who bet on the next NFL broadcasting rights deal being worth as much as the present $8bn. Like I said, enjoy Forbes. Things may never be this good again.</p> <p><strong>Bankers are avoiding sports cliches like the plague</strong></p> <p>One sign of the seriousness of the financial crisis has been the surprising dearth of sports metaphors in use among those charged with resolving it: surprising not only because commercial life has become so replete with them, but because they have been the stock-in-trade of the Bush White House. Who can forget the CIA chief George Tenet's description of the case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a \"slam dunk\"? Or Bush's promise that as president he would \"sprint to the line\"? That worked out well.</p> <p>So far there have been no touchdowns or home runs, nor has anybody offered 110%, except perhaps as an interest rate. That's because hardly anyone has stepped up to the plate, what with the general lack of heavy hitters and a playing field far from level, while the US Congress's attempt at blocking and tackling went badly awry. </p> <p>As for the counter cycle, that of business metaphors infiltrating the language of sport, a hard day at the office has taken on a whole new meaning. </p> <p><strong>Forget cricketers, in India the suits are the story</strong></p> <p>Dean Rusk, a former US secretary of state, once called his country \"the fat boy in the canoe\": when it moves, everyone must adjust. In cricket, that role is now filled by India, which makes worth noting the launch last week of what is destined, according to its backers, to become \"the most popular cricket website in the world\": www.bcci.tv, portal for the Board of Control for Cricket in India.</p> <p>So far it looks rather less like a website devoted to cricket than to the BCCI. Top story yesterday was \"Lalit Modi bags TV award\", the IPL commissioner having won a coveted CNBC Awaaz Consumer Award - well, someone must covet them. Top comment piece was \"In Praise of Sharad Pawar\", a 1,685-word paean about the outgoing BCCI boss, \"a statesman who is clear of thought, dispassionate and above all a true team leader\" by his BCCI colleague IS Bindra. </p> <p>The featured player profile, meanwhile, was \"Yuvraj Singh - The Making of a Legend\". Not so much of a legend that he made India's 15-man squad for the first two Tests against Australia.</p> <p><strong>BCCI web power play aims to put squeeze on Cricinfo</strong></p> <p>This venture bears close watching, for the BCCI is offering not just a web portal but to exercise a significant degree of control over the coverage of cricket in India, to the exclusion of its established rival Cricinfo. They are moving fast: a Google search for \"BCCI\" still directs you to the old BCCI site, www.bcci.cricket.deepthi.com, which looks like it was banged together in an hour by a teenage slacker between puffs on a bong.</p> <p>So far, though, there is little to allay suspicions that India's hegemonic pretensions in international cricket are less about the game than about the aggrandisement of its political and media elite. And as we are finding elsewhere, no hubris fails to find its nemesis.</p>",

  "<p>Police marksmen yesterday shot dead a dog that attacked four people, including a baby who was dragged 60 yards.</p> <p>Officers in Mitcham, south London, received a series of calls after the bull terrier-type dog bit a one-year-old boy on the leg before attacking a bus driver, a 50-year-old woman and another person, who received facial injuries.</p> <p>\"I saw the dog with a baby in its mouth.

  "<p>Britain's most controversial fertility doctor has once again been ranked as its most successful by the government's IVF watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</p> <p>Mohammed Taranissi's Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London recorded the highest success rates among more than 100 clinics offering IVF in Britain, according to figures released by the regulator. Nearly two-thirds of Taranissi's patients who were under 35 had a live birth in 2006.</p> <p>His success rate of 61% is almost double the national average of 31% for patients of the same age. Another clinic run by Taranissi, the Reproductive Genetics Institute, which has since closed, ranked second with a live birth rate of 50% for every cycle of treatment. </p> <p>Overall, the figures show that there were 12,596 live IVF births in 2006, up 11.9% on the previous year, meaning that 16 babies out of every 1,000 born are IVF infants. They also show a substantial rise in couples seeking IVF across the country. </p> <p>Nearly 35,000 women were treated in UK clinics in 2006, an increase of 6.8% on the year before. Success rates also rose across age groups, and markedly in women over 44, where live births rose from 0.8% to 4% for women using their own eggs. The use of donor sperm fell sharply, however, with 28% fewer treatments than in 2005. The fall, which the HFEA described as a \"great concern\", coincides with a change in the law that year which removed sperm donors' right to anonymity.</p> <p>Lisa Jardine, chair of the HFEA, said: \"In the year that we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the birth of the world's first IVF baby, these latest figures show just how far we've come. IVF is now commonplace, with the number of treatment cycles and births rising yet again.\" Last year, the average age of women having fertility treatment in Britain rose for the 10th consecutive year to 35.2 years old. </p> <p>The HFEA has been in dispute with Taranissi for years. Last year his offices were raided by the HFEA on the evening of a BBC documentary about his clinics. </p> <p>Taranissi is suing the broadcaster for libel. The BBC was yesterday ordered to pay an estimated \u00a3500,000 in legal costs to Taranissi. The BBC initially defended the documentary, IVF Undercover, which relied on undercover filming at Taranissi's clinic, saying it represented responsible journalism conveying matters in the public interest. However, it withdrew this defence last month. The BBC is continuing to defend its programme, citing the \"hazards\" of protecting confidential sources. It will seek to prove before the high court in January that the allegations are true.</p> <p>Taranissi appeared before the General Medical Council this week to answer unrelated allegations from two patients who were treated at his clinic. </p> <p>\"We maintain a good service by being available seven days a week, because you have to be available to do things at the best time. We've also introduced a few new things which are not widely practised across the board, and some of them are still very controversial,\" said Taranissi. </p> <p>London clinics completed the top five of the league table. The Lister Fertility Clinic and University College Hospital reported 44% live births in the under-35s, and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital 42%.</p> <p>The HFEA figures also reveal which clinics created the most twins. Taranissi's clinic ranked second for multiple births, with 32% being twins.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Fred Goodwin was under pressure at the helm of Royal Bank of Scotland last night after the government's unprecedented intervention in the banking sector.</p> <p>As Goodwin and his advisers raced to update the market on the size of the fundraising that is needed by the Edinburgh-based bank to meet the authorities' demands for an increase in its capital cushion, speculation grew that he would have to pay the price with his job and make way for a new chief executive.</p> <p>RBS denied reports that Goodwin and the chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, were about to be replaced, while industry sources said the departure of the man who built the domestic bank into one with international reach would be counterproductive as the financial world faces its biggest crisis since the 1930s.</p> <p>One shareholder said: \"It would have been unhelpful if he had gone today. It might be that he needs to go when they actually do the fundraising.\" </p> <p>RBS is one of the eight banks on the list published by the Treasury that have signed up to its bail-out package. The others are Abbey, owned by the Spanish bank Santander, which is also home to Alliance &amp; Leicester and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley; Barclays; HBOS, owner of Halifax; HSBC Bank - the UK arm of HSBC Holdings; Lloyds TSB; Nationwide Building Society; and Standard Chartered.</p> <p>One institutional shareholder with stakes in several of the banks said: \"That list of eight banks is a list of the blessed, where the Treasury is basically saying it will keep them standing whatever the cost. Whether that leaves anything for existing shareholders is a moot point.\"</p> <p>However, RBS failed to regain any of the share price loss it endured during Tuesday's market rout, ending the day at 90.7p, having at one point fallen to 72p. HBOS, the other big faller on Tuesday, was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, rising 23p to 117p. </p> <p>In practice, participation in the government's scheme does not mean the same to all those listed. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds TSB are likely to be interested in the opportunity to issue preference shares that the government will buy. Nationwide, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Abbey are more likely to take advantage of the cash being released to the money markets rather than issue new shares. In other words they might benefit from the cash release and debt guarantee but will not have the government as a shareholder, insisting on certain lending and pay criteria.</p> <p>The banks and one big building society are engaged in negotiations with the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury about how much capital they need to raise to meet their promise to increase the industry's capital cushion by 1% - a total of \u00a325bn. For some, most obviously HSBC and Standard Chartered, the figure may be zero, for others it could be substantial.</p> <p>The market is particularly keen to seek clarity from RBS, Barclays and the soon to be combined HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Barclays, fresh from its push on to Wall Street by buying parts of the failed Lehman Brothers, is estimated to need to raise up to \u00a33bn. John Varley, the Barclays chief executive, will not be alone among bank bosses in sounding out existing investors in the coming days to try to establish if they are prepared to stump up more. If the answer is no, the banks will have to issue preference shares to the government. </p> <p>Analysts said the banks could take years to recover and that the executives who do manage to retain their jobs are likely to find that pay packages are sharply reduced. With the government as a big shareholder, they said, banks will be forced to curb the risk-taking that landed them in trouble and clamp down on bonuses. Dividend payments are also likely to suffer.</p> <p>Paul Niven, of fund manager F&amp;C, said: \"We have now entered a new era for global banking. In return for taxpayers' money the state will gain a level of control over their governance, pay, and lending practices. Regulation will increase markedly and controls on all elements of banking practice will rise.\"</p> <p>Barclays could take \u00a36bn and a combined Lloyds TSB/HBOS \u00a35.5bn, Cazenove said, equivalent to about 25% of their market values. But the firm thought that RBS would seek as much as \u00a39bn, half its market value. </p> <p>There was speculation about whether the Lloyds TSB/HBOS deal would need to proceed given the sums the authorities are throwing at the money markets and the guarantees being offered to bank bonds to make it easier for them to raise funding. But it is thought they were pressing on with negotiations last night.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 20 councils across the country stand to lose tens of millions of pounds after the government refused to guarantee wholesale deposits which were deemed worthless after the collapse of Icelandic banks.</p> <p>The Local Government Association (LGA) has written to Alistair Darling to ask for councils to be treated in the same way as individual savers who were given a government guarantee yesterday that they would be compensated.</p> <p>The chancellor said local authorities could not expect to receive the same treatment as individual Britons who are holders of more than 300,000 retail accounts in Icelandic banks. \"They're a more informed investor,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>Treasury sources indicated last night that he would consider representations from council leaders. \"The chancellor will give them a sympathetic hearing,\" one government source said.</p> <p>However, it emerged last night that UK savers will be lucky to get their money by Christmas. After spending the day trying to mount a package to return their money earlier, the Financial Services Authority said the Icelandic internet bank Icesave was technically in \"default\" - thereby triggering payouts by the official but slower financial services compensation scheme (FSCS).</p> <p>The prospect of a lifeline for the local authorities was floated after the LGA warned more than 20 councils had deposits with one of Iceland's largest banks, Landsbanki, taken into Icelandic government control on Tuesday.</p> <p>Kent county council has \u00a350m in Landsbanki and its UK subsidiary Heritable, as well as Glitnir Bank, while Westminster city council has \u00a317m in Icelandic accounts.</p> <p>The LGA's intervention came after the chancellor announced that no UK saver would lose money from the closure of Icesave. About \u00a34bn of Britons' money was in its accounts when it ceased trading after its parent, Landsbanki, went into receivership on Tuesday.</p> <p>In a separate move, the Treasury yesterday arranged for more than \u00a33bn of UK savers' money in other Icelandic banks to be transferred to UK arm of the Dutch savings bank ING Direct. About 160,000 customers of Kaupthing Edge and savers with Heritable have become ING customers after the Treasury used its emergency powers to move their savings.</p> <p>The Treasury said it had frozen all Landsbanki's UK assets and would seek to recoup losses from the Icelandic government - in the courts if necessary. Under the terms of the rescue package, Iceland was responsible for the first \u00a316,000 of each saver's claim for compensation.</p> <p>The announcement that there will be compensation ended an anxious 36 hours for Icesave customers. Many feared they would lose any savings over \u00a350,000 - and possibly more, had Iceland refused to meet compensation obligations.</p> <p>FSCS chief executive Loretta Minghella said: \"Following the chancellor's announcement today, people can be confident they will be repaid in full.\"</p> <h2>Exposed to losses</h2> <p>Kent county council \u00a350m</p> <p>Brent approx \u00a315m</p> <p>Westminster \u00a317m</p> <p>West Sussex county council \u00a312.9m</p> <p>Havering \u00a312.5m</p> <p>Sutton \u00a35.5m</p> <p>Ipswich \u00a32m</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 24 2008.

  "<p>Pakistan's parliament was given a confidential briefing by the army yesterday in an attempt to forge a consensus on a \"homegrown\" anti-terror policy for the first time. The unprecedented briefing, by the new military spy chief, was a response to the widespread view that Pakistan is fighting \"America's war\", and it provided an opportunity for MPs to take control of national security for the first time. </p> <p>But analysts said there was little chance of agreement, with the Islamist groups and Nawaz Sharif's party, the main opposition group, believing that Pakistani interests were not being pursued. </p> <p>According to reports emerging last night about the briefing, the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, Lieutenant-General Ahmad Shujaa Pasha, admitted that past peace deals with militant groups had failed. He also told MPs that internal military operations were necessary, and said the army's current deployment in Bajaur, on the border with Afghanistan, had killed more than 1,000 militants.</p> <p>\"The briefing was rather superficial, more symptoms than diagnosis of a disease,\" said Khurram Dastagir, a parliamentarian from Sharif's party. \"But the fact that the briefing took place sets an excellent precedent for civilian supremacy.\"</p> <p>For years, Pakistan's security policy and approach to Afghanistan was decided essentially by the military, with little or no debate in parliament. Critics say that led to the ISI and other parts of the army backing the Taliban in Afghanistan and extremist groups based in Pakistan, to fight proxy wars in Afghanistan and India.</p> <p>\"No matter what happens, Islamist groups will not be brought into a consensus,\" said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst in Lahore. \"Sharif's stand is ambiguous. His problem is that his support overlaps with the religious parties.\" </p> <p>This week, Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the leader of a major religious party, Jamaat-i-Islami, described the anti-terror fight as a \"capitalist US and Indian conspiracy\".

  "<p>For once, Gordon Brown's soundbite undeniably matched the occasion yesterday. The \u00a3500bn breakfast bail-out of Britain's banking sector really was \"bold and far-reaching\" by any measure. With its announcement of the part-nationalisation of the heart of the country's financial system, the government delivered the funeral rites on the corpse of high Thatcherism - strangled to death by the very monsters it brought forth from the deep in the reckless frenzy of Big Bang deregulation more than two decades ago.</p> <p>Both the scale and the speed of the intervention were an object lesson in the power of government to shape and change the rules of the economic game. After a generation during which any suggestion of interference in the magic garden of City finance has been treated as destructive heresy, the rescue plan is a telling demonstration of the vast potential of public action - as well as that, in the words of the celebrated former British industrialist Arnold Weinstock, \"there is no such thing as a free market\".</p> <p>By taking a major public stake in the most strategically decisive sector of the economy, the government has finally broken the spell of private prerogative and the primacy of the market realm. Unlike the already-failing US Paulson plan, this rescue is based on the principle of cash for public equity. For all its weaknesses, the new package has brought the need for greater democratic control of economic life into sharp relief, as the catastrophic cost of the private sector's stewardship of finance for the rest of the economy makes the case for the social ownership of the banking system more powerfully every day.</p> <p>But the chorus of approval from the very people who have brought the banking system to the edge of collapse - along with the CBI and the Conservative party, which enthusiastically promoted its disastrous deregulation in the first place - should be a warning. Despite the \u00a350bn worth of minority ownership stakes Brown and Alistair Darling are planning to take in the country's biggest banks, these are non-voting preference shares with no formal say in the running of the institutions or the appointment of their managements.</p> <p>Yes, there are to be negotiations over principles of boardroom pay and new credit support for small businesses and home ownership. But, just as they took every step possible to head off the necessary nationalisation of Northern Rock earlier this year, ministers react with horror at the very thought of direct control of the banks the government will now be part-owning. While the TUC yesterday called for \"fat cats to be put on a strict diet\" and the surreally left-posturing Tory shadow chancellor George Osborne pressed in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon for a ban on bonuses in the newly bailed-out banks, Brown and the one-time Trotskyist Darling were having none of it.</p> <p>Real life seems likely to shift them both on executive pay - at a time when a good number of bankers doubtless count themselves lucky not to be facing jail terms - and the size of the public stakes, just as it has pushed the government this week to take action that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago. But there have to be the most serious doubts whether even yesterday's huge intervention will, like Paulson's, in practice match the scale of the crisis - or instead end up bailing out shareholders and the City elite that brought us to this pass, at the cost of billions of pounds of public money.</p> <p>The other two legs of the package - pumping hundreds of millions into the money markets in short-term loans and guarantees - ought to keep lending from freezing up altogether in the short term. But the experience of such repeated transfusions by central banks across the world over the past year should have driven home the point that the core of the crisis is one of solvency rather than liquidity. In other words, banks aren't lending to other banks because they (and the stock market) are convinced those outfits are sinking beneath a sea of bad debts - as in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price has fallen more than 80% since December.</p> <p>The government's planned recapitalisation will be injecting cash into the riskiest institutions and the danger is that shareholders will gratefully seize the opportunity to jump ship before their banks go under at huge public expense. Even without such crashes, the public debt pressures from yesterday's package are going to be heavy. Better surely to guarantee deposits and take over such banks once they've effectively failed, as in the case of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, securely recapitalising them as fully publicly owned enterprises.</p> <p>They could then become the core of a newly accountable and publicly controlled banking sector able to channel investment where it's needed, rather than into reckless speculation in debt and housing bubbles. What seems certain is that government intervention is going to have to become bolder still, as the crisis unfolds both in the financial markets and the real economy. Even if yesterday's package eases the domestic credit squeeze in the short term, all the signs suggest we are heading into something that goes well beyond a normal business cycle downturn, as the IMF's warnings of the most serious global crisis for 70 years underline. The threat is now of depression, not simply recession.</p> <p>Only a concerted government-driven expansion - including both a major public works programme and a much sharper cut in interest rates than the Bank of England managed yesterday - can seriously offset that, at both the national and global level. That means a programme of public housebuilding, home insulation and transport investment, along with intervention to control gas and electricity costs and action to turn repossessions into social renting. Of course that will increase public borrowing, but then so will the lengthening dole queues and multiplying business failures if Brown and his ministers decide the safer option is to tinker instead.</p> <p>By the scale and sweep of its intervention yesterday, the government has shown how much can be done and what resources can be mobilised when the stability of the system is at stake. The genie is out of the bottle - and the demand will now inevitably be for the same urgency and decisiveness on jobs, industry and housing as the crisis moves from the City to the high street.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Can any of us comprehend the mind of David Cass, who was prepared to kill his children following the end of his relationship with their mother, and then take his own life (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/23/3\">Father killed children after losing custody</a>, September 23)? We all hope and pray that it will never happen again, but we know that that is a hollow prayer, if the observations of Kate Hilpern are correct (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/24/children.mentalhealth\">Ending it all</a>, G2, September 24). </p> <p>But there is another issue within this headline and the article about which we family lawyers grieve. It is the use of the word \"custody\" - not just here, but within the common language of our society - and the effect the word has upon separating couples.</p> <p>That word has caused us untold problems. In the waiting room of the Lichfield domestic proceedings court I have often heard parents announce, to everyone in general and their spouse in particular, that \"I've got the fucking custody of the kids, you ain't\". </p> <p>During the 1980s, parliament asked the Law Commission to carry out a wide-ranging review of the law relating to children in this country and disputes concerning them. The part of the act that concerns disputes between parents (and others) in respect of their children came into effect in October 1991. </p> <p>We heaved a collective sigh of relief. The words \"custody\" and \"access\" ceased to be part of the lexicon of the family courts, and we hoped the acrimony generated by them would also end - that was the idea behind the new phraseology. Parliament gave us the principle of \"parental responsibility\" to define the equal legal relationship between both parents and their child. Parliament required the courts to address, in the best interests of the children, \"residence\" and \"contact\" only when there was a dispute. So far so good. But the press and the public never picked up the principles at all.</p> <p>Seventeen years later the words \"custody\" and \"access\" are still bandied around, in circumstances where the word \"custody\" immediately gives rise to vitriol, division, venom, despair and possibly, in cases such as that of David Cass and his children, death. As one colleague of Cass whom Hilpern quotes said: \"On Friday morning he was ecstatic with it all - he said it all looked good and he thought he could get back into the house and have custody of the kids.\"</p> <p>Words do alter perceptions. If ever we can abandon the use of the word \"custody\" then, with the passage of time, a parent involved in separation and divorce might more easily come to understand that the other parent - the one with whom the children do not reside - does and must have a role in the children's lives. That second parent might more easily understand that the fact their children spend more time living with the first parent does not denigrate their own status as a parent.</p> <p>If these perceptions were more widely understood and publicised, and the word \"custody\" left behind, then this tragedy, which happens time and again, might occur less often. I do not say that it would cease, but anything done to reduce the conflict between separating parents must be worth the effort.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Smith is a family lawyer <a href=\"mailto:jsmith@moseleys.co.uk\">jsmith@moseleys.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Those that were asking for a decisive intervention to halt a financial pandemic certainly got it yesterday. It was almost too big for shell-shocked markets to assimilate. Their reaction, in part driven by the mounting sense that this crisis is now international and out of control, was profoundly disappointing. </p> <p>Yet Britain has produced a well thought-through, bold and comprehensive plan to put its financial system on a sounder footing - well ahead of any other government. Messrs Brown and Darling for once deserve some congratulation. There is every chance they will find themselves lionised at the IMF meetings in Washington this week as the one government that has finally risen to the occasion.</p> <p>Big money is on the table. I estimated the cost of the package of measures that I recommended in the Crisis Watch column on these pages yesterday as between \u00a3350bn and \u00a3400bn, including up to \u00a350bn of new capital for the banks - which I thought at the limits of the possible. The overall price tag on the actual measures is \u00a3500bn. </p> <p>The proposed recapitalisation of the eight banks is vital - and it is conspicuous that it goes well beyond what any other government has contemplated. It will leave British banks as the most solidly capitalised in the world, even if it is a confidence shaker that the deficit in their capital was allowed to grow so big. The obvious concern is that without a \"bad bank\" to buy their toxic loans - the one omission from the package and importantly used by Sweden in its 1992 rescue plan, on which this is closely modelled - taxpayers' money will be immediately used to fund write-offs, so sending the banks back to square one. And the means of getting capital into the banks - preferred equity - has very little capacity to offer a compensating upside gain for the taxpayer because preferred equity share prices are more or less fixed, unless, like Warren Buffett's investment in Goldman Sachs, the government has warrants.</p> <p>A \"bad bank\" has the merit of both removing the risk of further write-downs against the replenished capital, and also allowing the toxic debt to be partly or even fully recovered in better times - saving the taxpayer cash. On the other hand if the government succeeds in preventing a bank going bankrupt and the disastrous domino effects that would create, while its other interventions work the amount of toxic debt might stay limited. </p> <p>The most eye-catching, eye-popping element of all is the up to \u00a3250bn of government guarantees for lending in the interbank market. This is targeted at what has emerged as the heartland of the problem - the de facto bank run, in which the big banks had completely lost confidence and stopped lending to each other. The guarantee is a double whammy. It will allow them to lend to one another again without fear, and to use guaranteed loans to finance maturing asset-backed securities - and on a huge scale. Barclays can now comfortably refinance the \u00a328bn of its securities falling due next year; RBS its \u00a318bn. </p> <p>Given all this - along with the doubling in size of the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme and the coordinated cut in interest rates by Britain, the US and the EU - it is serious that the FTSE 100 closed the day more than 200 points down. One problem is that it will take time for the guarantee to open the interbank market, where the London interbank offered rate only eased a tiny fraction yesterday. Another is that the British action has exposed the inadequacy of what is proposed elsewhere - and thus the gigantic scale of both the problem and what has to be done by other governments, confirmed by the sombre pronouncements by the IMF and chair of the US Federal Reserve. </p> <p>The American decision not to support Lehman Brothers is now turning out to be the fulcrum on which the crisis has turned. It is not just that Lehman had $110bn of senior bonds that are now virtually valueless; it had written an estimated additional $440bn credit default swaps on top which it cannot honour - a large part of which will come due at the end of this week. Wall Street is transfixed, as are the Asian markets. Nobody knows where these losses will end up. It has suddenly become obvious that the Paulson plan cannot simultaneously handle this together with the fallout of the sub-prime crisis. And in addition there is the impossible challenge of financing trillions of dollars of asset-backed securities which are maturing when the world's interbank markets are shut. Britain may have invented a way to allow its banks to do this, but banks in other countries need the same help, along with the same chance to recapitalise themselves.</p> <p>This will dominate the discussions at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings this weekend. Britain has bitten the bullet and partially nationalised its banking system. Other countries, notably the Americans, need to follow our lead - and to do so fast. Incredibly, it may have fallen to Gordon Brown to show the world how to avert a slump.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is executive vice-chair of the Work Foundation </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:will.hutton@observer.co.uk\">will.hutton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Hereford City Council has decided that twenty minutes is long enough for a woman to spend inside any one shop - long enough, at least, to leave her motor-car outside.</p> <p>The decision was reached only by the casting vote of the Mayor, but the Mayor this year is a woman, herself a great shopper, who should know if anyone does how long it really takes to buy a new hat. It will, one imagines, be welcomed by everybody but the guilty few.</p> <p>When the distinction between \"buying\" and \"shopping\" was first made by \"Punch\" many years ago, the \"shoppers\" in the strict sense of the word were a nuisance only to others who came into the shop with intent to buy. But now, when they park their cars in the streets as well as their persons at the counter, they are the plague of everyone who ventures into the neighbourhood.</p> <p>Who has not seen Manchester's King Street in the afternoon, with a continuous row of cars parked on either side of the already narrow carriageway and leaving just enough room for one vehicle to slip through at a snail's pace.

  "<p>Nancy Bevan, who has died aged 95, was, by any account, a well-connected woman. Her stories of early life at the top table gave an intended moral commentary on social inequality and the absurdities of the rich and powerful, ranging from a dinner at the Cunards, where a footman provided newspaper so the hostess's Pekinese could relieve itself, to defending the Attlee government at a banquet in the US while fellow guests, including the Astors, stubbed out their cigarettes on half-finished steaks. </p> <p>She became, however, an inveterate letter writer and campaigner for many causes, including Greenpeace, Compassion in World Farming and the Quaker befriending prisoners scheme. </p> <p>Nancy was born into the Pilkington family in Southsea, Hampshire. Her father George, a submariner, was lost at sea in 1915, an event that shaped her detestation of war and her subsequent Quakerism. She was a god-daughter of William Hozier, Winston Churchill's brother-in-law, and stepdaughter of Rear Admiral Hugh Marrack. She travelled extensively in the 1930s, meeting Admiral D\u00f6nitz, who briefly became Hitler's successor, and Admiral Yamamoto, who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor. A stay in South Africa opened her eyes to the ill-treatment of black people long before apartheid became an official policy. </p> <p>Following marriage to Bevan Brooke, also a naval officer, Nancy returned to Britain before the outbreak of the second world war. Her war work included driving ambulances, teaching members of the Polish Free Army and minding an escaped agent from Poland before his debriefing. </p> <p>Nancy's loathing of US and British foreign policy influenced her views in the later years. After her divorce and remarriage to Eric Bevan - a scholarly Quaker and the son of JA Bevan, the first captain of the Welsh rugby team - she moved from Dorset to Wales in the late 1970s. She had ban-the-bomb logos mounted into two gates to her house, causing the sleepy village of St Ishmaels, Pembrokeshire, to wake up to the dangers of nuclear war. </p> <p>Generous to her friends and family, Nancy was nonetheless thrifty and ecologically aware long before it became fashionable. A row of washed plastic bags hanging on the washing line ready for re-use, and the compulsive darning of all clothing that could be repaired demonstrated her everyday green values. At the age of 90, she could still be found demonstrating at RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, against the US B52 bombers leaving for Iraq.</p> <p>Nancy enriched and enlivened the lives of all her friends. She provoked thought that was interlaced with good humour, and constantly reminded us that protest and fairness are fine human virtues. She is survived by her daughter Rosanne and granddaughters Katrin and Rebecca.</p>",
  "<p>There are pretty flowers and folderols everywhere, soft cushions and soft-footed waiters. Coffee and little sugary biscuits are served. I take the coffee black and don't eat the biscuits, though I am breakfast-less. Sugar is anathema to New Yorkers, I know, and Judy Sheindlin is very New York, tiny, elegant, charming and wise-crackingly clever. I must want her to think well of me. </p> <p>\"Have a cookie,\" she suggests.</p> <p>\"No thanks,\" I say. It's not so much that I want her approval, I realise. I fear her disapproval. </p> <p>Judge Judy is a TV show watched daily by 10 million people worldwide, most of them women, and after 12 years of public popularity and critical non-attention is into its 11th series for CBS and still going strong. Sheindlin acts as a latter-day Queen Solomon, to whom the people bring their grievances against one another, and as such she doles out swift and scathing justice, threatening to cut the baby in half to decide who is the real mother. As befits the century, it's done from a TV screen, not a throne, in the form of a reality-show small claims court, and publicists, not prophets, extol her. </p> <p>\"Being a TV star is a great gift,\" she says. \"Everyone treats you royally. I started out in a two-room apartment in Brooklyn, and thought, 'Never again.' Now all this.\" And she gestures round the grandeur of London's Dorchester hotel, this mother of five, grandmother to 11, wife of a retired high court judge. Then she complains that she hasn't slept. She had to move rooms to get away from a faulty air-conditioner and spent the night on a sofa with a towel beneath and a towel on top. \"Even though I am a star,\" she adds, \"it's the kind of thing that still happens.\" </p> <p>I say I know what it's like. However hard I try, I still end up toiling up some hill in the rain with a carrier bag in each hand and a toddler clinging to my legs, and she looks at me with pity: too much. For her, it would never get quite as low as that. </p> <p>For 25 years Sheindlin was a \"real\" family court judge in New York, notorious for her fast decisions and wise-cracking judgments, appreciated as the scourge of villains and the friend of the oppressed. And then TV discovered her and she became a reality-show judge instead, bringing her experience and attitudes with her, as she roots out liars, exposes cheats and berates vandals. She believed, and still believes, that young offenders need a sharp shock. \"Five per cent were real bad apples,\" she says. \"The other 95% were just trying to survive the only way they knew. But that does not excuse them.\" She has no time for a liberal press that finds excuses for antisocial behaviour and so encourages it. Oddly, the \"real\" people who turn up for her judgments seem to concur: they are content to abide by Judy's decisions, no matter how they are humbled and exposed, or smirk or rage after the show. It may be, of course, merely that the production company pays the fines she imposes, so contestants - those accused of cheating on eBay, bullied at school, sued by their mothers, persecuted by ex-spouses, or whatever, seem eager enough to turn up. It is Jerry Springer without the schadenfreude or noisy vulgarity, The Weakest Link without the spite.</p> <p>The Judge Judy show dominates the ITV2 midweek daytime schedules, or you can watch a selection of her Solomonic judgments on YouTube, where 10-minute chunks of her programmes are freely available.</p> <p>The path from Brooklyn to Hollywood - in 2006 she became the 2,304th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - was scarcely of her making. It just evolved. She had a secure and happy beginning - she describes her dentist father as \"the greatest thing since sliced bread\" and her mother as \"a meat-and-potatoes kind of gal\". Only when her father died did she realise to what degree her mother was \"the glue that kept the family together. But then most women are.\" </p> <p>A bright, argumentative girl, Sheindlin went to a tough state school, on to New York Law School and in 1965 began to practise law in Manhattan. In 1972 she moved on to the family court, where she prosecuted juvenile delinquency cases for the State of New York. Her approach was simple, caustic and forthright. \"Take responsibility for yourself, your actions and the children you bring into the world. No excuses.\" </p> <p>By the time she was outed by the TV programme 60 Minutes as a potential star, she had sat through more than 20,000 family cases. She had learned how to get through to people. \"You have to make them listen, and you have to talk sense, and then they'll hear you.\" It made sense to use these rare skills to speak to the masses through a TV courtroom, and not to the few individuals in a real one. </p> <p>She is described as acid-tongued and brutally sarcastic, but I see no evidence of it. She is more like a busy mother, beside herself with anxiety for the welfare of a troublesome child. When she tells a recalcitrant male litigant, \"You're nothing special! Believe me, I have three sons so I know. You are no gift - you're not even good-looking,\" it is done to bring him to his senses, before he gets into worse trouble, rather than in an attempt to humiliate him. And still they come back for more. </p> <p>She is reassuring and funny, both stern father and anxious mother to an audience I suspect she sees as dumb and getting dumber, and in dire need of reform. She is all for the swift, sharp shock of punishment, seeing it as the only approach to juvenile crime that works. I protest that the US already has the highest rate of youth imprisonment in the world, second only to China. She looks at me with sharp, intelligent eyes. \"So?\" she says. \"Get them early and get them hard. Then they won't come back. The choice is theirs.\"</p> <p>Fortunately these days the wealth of Solomon accompanies the love of the people. In a recent survey of Hollywood's best-paid \"talkers\", Sheindlin came joint third on $45m, with David Letterman, behind Oprah Winfrey and Howard Stern. Indeed, she has just built herself a magnificent Versailles of a temple in Greenwich, Connecticut: 24,000 sq ft, 17 bathrooms, taking 400 labourers a mere 20 weeks to build, complete with fancy ready-made grounds transported thither in tubs. A Sims computer game construction for most of us, but for her, real. She impresses even herself. \"The ceilings are higher even than they are here,\" she says. </p> <p>She is a Brooklyn girl made good and does not forget it: high-powered, industrious, conscious of her responsibility. She believes celebrities must set an example: be like our Queen, not Britney's teenage sister - pregnant out of wedlock and setting a fashion for teenage pregnancies, which the tax-payer will have to support. She seems motivated less by ambition than by a genuine social conscience - she feels it would be immodest to claim 10 out of 10 for the latter. I award her a nine, inasmuch as in the UK, unlike in the US, we are suspicious of immoderate wealth. </p> <p>I ask her about the election. She says it is touch and go. She is a friend of McCain - \"a real meat-and-potatoes guy\" - but likes Obama. He represents youth and hope and the capacity to trust, since no one knows anything about him. Everyone wants to vote for him - but in the quiet and secrecy of the voting booth, who knows what will happen? Caution may triumph over trust. </p> <p>Different personalities seem to pop out of this tiny, graceful, powerful person speaking from the depths of her hotel armchair throne. Sometimes it is Mary Poppins, sometimes Supernanny, sometimes Barry Goldwater, the American politician known as Mr Conservative. She is \"reactionary\" in distrusting the liberal media, seeing it as having fostered the blame culture to the detriment of society, \"progressive\" in her approval of the feistiness of Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Before we part, the photographer turns up and you remember this slip of a woman from Brooklyn is a star. There is a kind of focusing of energy here that the camera loves; so does she. </p> <p>\"Your top is uneven,\" tactfully murmurs her publicity guy. The black top has slipped over her shoulder to show a sliver of white. </p> <p>\"It is as I mean it to be,\" she replies sharply, and he quickly shuts up. She pulls the top down even further over her shoulder, and is instantly glamorous. She is right and he is wrong. It is this particular talent that has brought her to this point in life. She is everyone's tough but loving parent where parents are reluctant to be parents and want, disastrously in her view, to be buddies. Do what she says and you'll survive; defy her and you'll perish. </p> <p>We have a picture taken together.</p> <p>\"I never know whether to keep my head up or down,\" I complain.</p> <p>\"Up,\" she says, \"always up.\" I do as she says. Of course, she's right. </p> <p>Reality TV - or semi-reality TV, as this is - is here to stay. We shouldn't complain: it is the people's choice. The producer's time has come. The contriver of the programme gets the glory; the writer and director are lucky if they get a mention. The cheaper daytime shows - property, cooking, lifestyle, courtroom - slop over into evening viewing. If we want information we go to the internet now, not a documentary. If we want drama there's the news and the goings-on of celebrities. If we want a stage not a screen we can go to a musical. The power of personality remains: Judge Judy has spawned a host of imitators, but none has her charisma, or her ratings. </p> <p>A pity McCain didn't choose her, rather than Palin, for his running mate. Her idea of solving juvenile delinquency by having every woman implanted at birth with a contraceptive chip, to be taken out only on request, might cause some controversy. But one can see her point. At least every child born would be a wanted child, and not - as she sees it as being in the US - the result of an accident and a bottle of vodka.</p> <p>She believes in the legal system. \"All those good people huddling behind bars in gated communities - it's the wrong way round.

  "<p>He has been accused of crushing political opponents, bullying the neighbours, and - in the words of one British diplomat appalled by Russia's heavy-handed treatment of the British Council - of \"punching a librarian\".</p> <p>But Russia's gladiatorial prime minister Vladimir Putin also has another way of dispensing with his enemies: he chucks them on a mat. On Tuesday - his 56th birthday - Putin presented an educational judo DVD for budding students of the sport. Its title: Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Putin, a black belt, has already co-authored a book on judo, which he mastered while growing up in a gritty neighbourhood of Soviet Leningrad. He has now taken his passion for the martial art a step further, starring in a 75-minute training video filmed over the past 18 months in Moscow and St Petersburg.</p> <p>The film shows a white-robed Putin performing a series of dashing throws. At one point he can be seen dancing balletically with a practice partner, who lands on the ground with a satisfying thwack. (Russian TV viewers who saw clips on Tuesday also saw Putin perform an intriguing hip wiggle.)</p> <p>More than this though, Russia's former president talks enigmatically about the philosophy behind the sport. Addressing the camera, and with oriental music jangling in the background, Putin declares: \"In a bout concessions are permissible but only in one case: if it is for victory.\" Putin is wearing black; for a moment you could be forgiven for thinking you're watching a Russian version of The Matrix.</p> <p>Putin's former judo trainer, Anatoli Rakhlin, says his pupil was a gifted student who has popularised the martial art in Russia. \"It's important that our prime minister is a sportsman and not a drunk,\" he adds, before shedding light on Putin's mystical commentary: \"Victory is an integral part of judo. It goes back to when a Japanese master looked at a cherry tree laden with snow. The branches bent - but then flung the snow off. It's about giving and then winning.\"</p> <p>Putin's sporting prowess has been a hard act to follow for his presidential successor, Dmitry Medvedev, who is known to prefer yoga. In August, however, Medvedev sent Russian tanks rolling into the mountains of Georgia, putting an end to questions about his macho credentials. In any case, Putin is not short of old judo pals to spar with: his long-time friend and judo partner Vasily Shestakov is now an MP in Russia's Duma</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\">South Africa's</a> ruling African National Congress is on the brink of splitting after senior allies of the toppled president, Thabo Mbeki, said yesterday that they were \"serving divorce papers\" on the new party leadership under Jacob Zuma because it had abandoned the movement's founding principles and put \"our national democracy in danger\".</p> <p>Mosiuoa Lekota, a former political prisoner and party chairman who quit as defence minister when Mbeki was forced out as president last month, said he and other disillusioned officials planned to canvass for support within the ANC in a process that seems to be \"leading logically\" to the creation of a new political party to run in next year's general election. </p> <p>\"This is probably the parting of the ways,\" said Lekota. </p> <p>Lekota accused the new leadership of hijacking the ANC and \"eliminating our internal democracy\" in order to make Zuma the ruling party's candidate at the election and to stop him facing trial on corruption charges. \"These elements who are not committed to these principles of the ANC may well decorate themselves with the name ANC but they are not ANC ... The current leadership have shown they are not ANC,\" he said.</p> <p>Lekota was flanked by the former deputy defence minister Mluleki George but is not clear how many senior officials he can carry with him, although he said there are significant numbers of rank and file members who oppose the existing leadership. Lekota's influence was severely undermined after he failed to assert control as chairman of the party conference that saw Mbeki deposed as ANC leader last year. </p> <p>The ANC leadership quickly derided Lekota's move, accusing him and his supporters of being bitter at losing control of the party. ANC spokeswoman Jesse Duarte said the dissidents were \"launching a stillborn organisation\" because they had no future in the party.</p> <p>\"They were never willing to accept the will of the members of the ANC and they have therefore pursued other avenues to advance their careers,\" she said.</p> <p>Zuma warned ANC members that they did not have a blank cheque to destabilise the party. </p> <p>While any new political party will face a formidable challenge to take significant support from the ANC, despite growing disillusionment among ordinary voters, the bitterness of Lekota's attack on Zuma and his allies reflects the deep schisms that could see other factions break away, particularly on the left over economic policy.</p> <p>\"There has been elevated to national importance interests of individuals rather than the interests of our country,\" said Lekota. </p> <p>He accused the new party leadership of betraying the ANC's Freedom Charter, which formed the basis of the liberation struggle, by demanding that there be a \"political solution\" to prevent Zuma facing trial for corruption which could see him sent to prison for years. </p> <p>\"South Africans are getting arrested from time to time. They have to appear before the courts and they have to bring evidence to prove that they are innocent or not. Now we are saying, no, in a particular case - of the state versus the president of the ANC - there must be a political solution. What has happened to the clause in the Freedom Charter: all shall be equal before the law?\" he said.</p> <p>Lekota also said that the Zuma camp had introduced tribalism into the party's internal politics with a campaign projecting Zuma as \"100% Zulu boy\" and promoted violence with Zuma's trademark song, Bring Me My Machine Gun.</p> <p>\"Leaders of the ANC stand on public platforms singing songs that advocate violence and the collection of weapons. To what end? To promote what policy of the ANC?\" he said.</p> <p>But Lekota's accusation that the new ANC leadership is \"eliminating internal democracy\" with a purge of Mbeki's supporters and attacks on Zuma's critics will ring hollow among many of Mbeki's critics who were hounded with a vicious vilification campaign by the former president's backers. </p> <p>Confirming that he has virtually made up his mind to launch a rival party, Lekota said it would challenge Zuma at the ballot box. \"Of course we have to contest the elections next year ... the people of our country must choose between ourselves and those who have taken a different route,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The answer seems to be no, unless you are specifically licensed by a movie studio and your main line of business is manufacturing DVDs. But if you're just someone at home, then the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) really doesn't want you making copies - not for backup, not for storing on a hard drive, not at all.</p> <p>This approach has been solidified by the lawsuit filed by the MPAA against RealNetworks, Rob Glaser's company, to prevent it selling RealDVD - a $30 (\u00a317) DVD-ripping program - that seems pretty draconian. The software creates a disk image on your hard drive that will only play on the PC that made it. You can't share it with anyone. You can't even burn it. But a judge granted a temporary injuction against Real.</p> <p>Puzzled by what the MPAA would find acceptable in a DVD-copying program, since making encrypted disk images (which Real argues is \"fair use\" for personal backup, normally allowed under US law) is hardly piracy on the high seas, I called the MPAA.</p> <p>Unfortunately it was unable to discuss the case, or even the general point about what would be acceptable: when we spoke on Tuesday afternoon, it was awaiting a further court hearing that evening (UK time), and the judge had gagged both sides from discussing the case or related matters.</p> <p>Glaser, writing his first post on RealNetworks' blog (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/glaser01\">bit.ly/glaser01</a>), insisted ahead of its launch that RealDVD was \"clearly legal\", based on a separate case involving the MPAA and Kaleidascape, which produces a system for storing films on home servers. Though a judge ruled in Kaleidascape's favour, the MPAA is appealing.</p> <p>But why is the MPAA is waging war against those who would be its friends? Real and Kaleidascape took huge pains to prevent content being shared. Other free programs widely available online - such as Handbrake - simply crack the CSS encryption on standard DVDs so you can create a backup copy and even burn a fresh backup disc.</p> <p>That's been possible for nearly a decade. And there's an interesting twist: Real accidentally made it feasible for the group of Norwegian hackers to crack CSS back in November 1999: according to IDG's report then (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/glaser02\">bit.ly/glaser02</a>), \"the XingDVD Player, from RealNetworks Inc. subsidiary Xing Technologies, didn't have its [CSS decryption] keys adequately safeguarded. The hackers were thus able to deduce how to crack DVDs and released the CSS program, which will do it automatically.\"</p> <p>In fact, the studios' best hope of curtailing DVD copying is to get everyone to trade up to Blu-ray high-definition DVDs, whose encryption scheme hasn't been comprehensively cracked.</p> <p>But given the economic climate, it's hard to see people being willing to shell out hundreds of pounds on new DVD players, and then more than \u00a315 per disc.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 10 2008. We should have referred to the CSS (Content Scramble System) encryption on standard DVDs, not DeCSS encryption. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<h2>Just the net, please</h2> <p>Is there a device that will provide email and internet access without the need for a computer, and using a TV as a monitor? A large display is essential because of eyesight problems.<br><strong>GB Lowe</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Plenty of products have been offered, over the years - including Web TV, Microsoft's \"Internet Companions\" and Amstrad's e-Mailer - but there seems to be no market for them. Well, not a market based on customers spending money. The best option at the moment is probably the Asus Eee PC Box (\u00a3199), which is very small and, according to Asus, can plug into a TV set ... though a TV is not a good monitor for people with eyesight problems. The Eee Box runs Windows XP Home, but it has a simple Linux-based front end called Express Gate (bit.ly/aj0042), which lets you surf and run Skype without loading Windows. There's a demo on YouTube at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0043\">bit.ly/aj0043</a>. (A full Linux version of the Box is due soon, possibly this month.)</p> <p>The Eee PC Box is actually a netbook like the Asus Eee PC, Acer Aspire One or MSI Wind but without the built-in screen. Netbooks usually have 7in, 8.9in or 10.2in LCD screens, which you would probably find too hard to read, though they're a good solution if your eyesight can cope. With the Eee PC Box, however, you can buy a screen that's as big as you need, or can afford. Streaming media devices such as the Archos TV+ and Apple TV can also be used for web browsing, and in the future, web access may be built in to many more devices, including LCD TV sets. But at the moment, the easiest way to get a big screen, a decent keyboard and a speedy machine is to buy a cheap Dell, HP or similar PC, which usually means running Windows XP or Vista. Windows also has accessibility features to help vision-impaired users, and lots of related software such as screen readers.</p> <h2>Trip computer</h2> <p>My wife and I embark on a round-the-world trip at the end of November. We need a secure method of moving money from UK accounts and also the ability to send emails and check hotel bookings and flight times. Would a Dell Inspiron Mini 9 be suitable?<br><strong>Bob Davey</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Netbooks or minibooks will be used by many travellers because they are small, light and cheap, and will do the job. However, you will need to work on the security. The simplest idea is to do all your web browsing using a privacy mode so that data is discarded instead of stored. Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 all have \"porn modes\". </p> <p>An alternative with Windows XP-based netbooks like Dell's Mini 9 is to run the Firefox Portable Edition browser from an encrypted USB memory stick. You can do this with the Base Edition of the Portableapps.com Suite, which provides a menu system along with an office suite, calendar/scheduler, instant messaging client, antivirus, Sudoku game and backup utility (<a href=\"http://portableapps.com/suite\">portableapps.com/suite</a>). Also, always use secure https:// addresses whenever possible.</p> <p>Using a memory stick keeps data off the computer and reduces your security risk if is lost or stolen. But if you do store personal information on your netbook, try to keep it in an encrypted, password-protected file or folder (<a href=\"http://truecrypt.org\">truecrypt.org</a>). You could even encrypt the whole hard drive, though this may not be very convenient.</p> <h2>Caught by NoAdware </h2> <p>I recently downloaded NoAdware 5.0 from an advert on your blog: it was advertised as free! Now I find that it won't allow me to remove trojanguarder without paying for the product. Can I safely get rid of it?<br><strong>Peter Paul </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> You should be able to remove NoAdware with the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs utility. You can then download SuperAntiSpyWare (<a href=\"http://www.superantispyware.com\">superantispyware.com)</a> - free for personal use - to remove trojanguarder. To avoid confusion, I do recommend Adblock Plus, which is a Firefox browser extension, and Lavasoft's Ad-Aware, but I don't recommend NoAdware.</p> <h2>Back up sticks</h2> <p>I've started backing up onto a 2GB memory stick. Is this a safe method?<br><strong>Martin James </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> USB memory sticks, CompactFlash and SD cards are good for short-term backups if you don't have an external hard drive, but they can be corrupted and lose data. Also, to avoid overwriting backups, I'd rather you used two memory sticks and alternated them. However, I'd still recommend making a CD-R backup every month or so, as an archive. CD-Rs are cheap and don't take up much room. Even if you throw most of the old discs away, you can still keep multiple backups of data going back years. And one day, you might need them.</p> <h2>Windows oddity</h2> <p>Double-clicking folders in Windows Explorer has suddenly changed from opening that folder to opening the Search dialogue. Any ideas?<br><strong>Phil Leahy </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Oddly enough, this is a known problem caused by an incorrect entry in the Windows registry.

  "<p>David Berry was puzzled when his computer began throwing strange, lingering popup notices at him demanding payment to a company called Platte Media. Five days later, there was a \"notification\" demanding \u00a329.99. \"The Platte representative was ill-mannered, totally ignored any suggestion that the subscription was unsolicited, and as a matter of expediency I coughed up \u00a329.99,\" he says.</p> <p>Intending to take the matter further, he asked for a VAT receipt. But when the receipt arrived without a VAT number, he telephoned again. \"I was informed that any payment made to Platte Media was to Platte International in the British Virgin Islands and as such was not subject to VAT,\" David says.</p> <p><strong>Popup puzzle</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile Malcolm, who prefers not to give his surname, had a different puzzle: a letter from Platte Media sent to his address threatening action at the small claims court for non-payment. What he couldn't figure out was: how had the company got his address?</p> <p>Platte International - formerly known as Micro Bill Systems, or MBS - has an unusual business model. People go to websites that use its software. To view the site, they click an agreement that offers a free trial, and download software to their (Windows) PC. If you don't actively end the trial and don't pay the subscription, you'll get a series of popup windows that make it harder and harder to use your machine. If you then call Platte, it will help you disable the popups.</p> <p>Platte International Ltd has previously garnered attention from this newspaper and BBC Radio's You &amp; Yours programme for having stills from mainstream films on a website (Porn billing firm lures customers with promises of Hollywood movies, June 26) when it was offering thousands of pornographic films and film trailers. But the mysteries around the company won't go away. The latest: its apparent ability to obtain personal details about customers, and a trickier one about whether - or where - it is registered for VAT.</p> <p>Platte's signup process for its free three-day trial to watch pornographic films is unmistakable thanks to an undertaking with the Office of Fair Trading. Despite this, some consumers claim only to see a popup bill demanding \u00a329.99 for a 30-day subscription - though it's possible that it's because they won't admit signing up on the family PC, as has happened in a number of cases.</p> <p>For some who don't pay, Platte sends letters threatening legal action at the small claims court. This includes a page of \"pre submission\" information which could, to the unwary, appear to come from \"Issuing Court Northampton County Court\" - but which doesn't.</p> <p>Michelle, who has no interest in pornography, received letters from Platte just addressed to \"the computer owner\". \"I phoned the court, who said that because there was no claim number attached, it wasn't valid, but asked me to send the information in so they could have sight of it.\"</p> <p>The IP address quoted by Platte does not match Michelle's ISP and, strangely, she hasn't seen any popup bills, either. Those ignoring the popups have also received what one describes as a \"sham county court notice\". </p> <p>Several people have suggested that Platte uses IP addresses to ask internet service providers, because when the software installs it does not demand any personal details. The Information Commissioner's office says: \"Unless they are required by law or by a court order, it would be for the internet service provider to determine whether or not it is lawful to provide another company with the names and addresses of consumers. If we receive complaints about this issue we will, of course, investigate.\"</p> <p>Stanly Hiwat, the chief executive officer of Platte International Ltd, told us by email that the only situation where Platte would obtain an individual's address is \"where a court has granted a Norwich Pharmacal Order [a specific legal device] requiring the ISP to disclose it\". He said: \"Whilst this option is available to us we have not to date had to obtain such an order. All address information that we use is information provided to us directly by the customer themselves.\" </p> <p><strong>Over the threshold?</strong></p> <p>We took Malcolm's IP address to his ISP, TalkTalk, for comment. \"As far as we are aware, we have not revealed this customer's details - or any customers' details - to Platte. It is not TalkTalk's policy to do this except in the most serious circumstances, for instance when we have been asked to cooperate with the police,\" says the ISP.</p> <p>But the boot might be on the other foot after David's experience over the missing VAT number. We asked HM Revenue and Customs whether a company registered overseas, but providing a service to a customer in the UK, would be exempt from VAT. Not so, said HMRC: non-EU suppliers providing \"electronically supplied services to UK consumers\" were required to register for VAT if the VAT threshold is exceeded.</p> <p>So has Platte exceeded the VAT threshold, of \u00a367,000 in a year? It seems remarkable if it hasn't. Ashley Bateup, chief executive officer of the UK-registered Platte International Ltd, which operates in Leeds, says the UK managed services company is registered for VAT, but he \"cannot comment on any other company\". Platte has also said its customer contracts are \"with Platte International BVI\".</p> <p>Hiwat, of Platte International Ltd, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands - although he is in Brazil - also didn't answer any detailed questions about VAT. \"Truth remains, however, that Platte International Ltd BVI insists on operating a healthy business model that does not antagonise its customers, nor the institutions that protect them, nor do we willingly seek to offend applicable laws and business practices,\" he said in an email.</p> <p><strong>Vital statistics</strong></p> <p>Platte claims that only 20% of customers cancel before the end of the trial, and adds: \"Contacts to Trading Standards from our customers represented less than 0.2% of total downloads by customers in the previous month.\"</p> <p>That gives us some help. West Yorkshire Trading Standards (where Platte is based in the UK) says it has so far received 693 complaints and/or inquiries nationally about Platte, with 129 of those in September and 81 in August.</p> <p>That suggests between 40,500 and 64,500 downloads per month, and that 80% of those signed up - which, at \u00a329.99 each comes to between \u00a3971,676 and \u00a31.5m of revenues each month. In fact, just 2,000 subscriptions each month is enough to exceed the limit, assuming all the subscriptions come from the UK and EU, which would all attract VAT.</p> <p>Prevx, an internet security company, monitors Platte's activities and says that \"Platte downloads/installs may easily reach 50,000 a month\".</p> <p>Mike Bailey, of accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that enforcing VAT registration for non-EU companies supplying electronic services is a real problem. It's not easy to find out which non-EU companies should have registered or their income. \"How would you possibly be able to track that?\" he asks.</p> <p>But HMRC is more determined. \"If HMRC becomes aware that an overseas trader is liable to register in the UK, it can compulsorily register them and issue an assessment of any tax due. If appropriate, a civil evasion or belated notification penalty can also be issued.\"</p> <p>So is everyone happy with Platte? The company claims \"very satisfied customers who sign up month after month and appreciate the security our payment options offer\". Despite this, forums like mbsvictims.org.uk show that reports of unexplained downloads persist.</p> <p>But it may be that all those satisfied customers will create a problem of their own for the company. Ironically, its success could be Platte's biggest headache.</p> <h2>Platte in numbers</h2> <p><strong>67,000</strong><br>Threshold in pounds at which a business must register for VAT</p> <p><strong>50,000</strong><br>Estimated monthly level of downloads and installation of Platte software </p> <p><strong>20%</strong><br>Percentage of customers Platte says cancel before the end of the trial period</p>",
  "<p>Since Peter Kay became one of the hottest talents on television, through Phoenix Nights and standup, there has been understandable excitement about where he might go next on TV. It turns out that he has chosen to go for TV: the tongue-busting title of his new Channel 4 show, broadcast this Sunday, is Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Strictly on Ice - a highly evolved satire on reality TV.</p> <p>Using genuine personnel from wannabe programmes (presenter Cat Deeley, judges Nicki Chapman and Pete Waterman), Kay has devised a competition between fictional contestants, including Kay himself in drag as big-hearted chanteuse Geraldine. For extra realism, the send-ups will be broadcast in two parts on the same night: an early evening heat and a late-night results show.</p> <p>In targeting TV with this one-off, Kay is sniping from a crowded rooftop. This autumn has already seen the release of an American movie - Live! - set behind the scenes at a network prepared, literally, to kill for ratings. Meanwhile, two new books by leading crimewriters use broadcasting as the background for murder: Laura Lippman's Another Thing to Fall and Christopher Brookmyre's A Snowball in Hell.</p> <p>Fictional satire of television arguably began way back in 1949, with the idea of the screens watching you in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Kay, in choosing reality TV and talent shows as his subject, joins writers who have recently recognised that an art form we thought we understood (TV as mass entertainment is now almost 60 years old) has suddenly undergone a new mutation, reaching levels of stupidity and cruelty that even the medium's greatest detractors never imagined.</p> <p>This revulsion at what broadcast culture has become drives Bill Guttentag's Live!, which had a limited cinema release here last month but deserves wider attention when it comes to DVD. Its savage conceit is that a desperate US network recruits half a dozen economically needy Americans to play Russian roulette live on air. The five who survive will receive $5m. The film's power lies in the fact that it is shot with precise attention to the grammar of television - the cutaways of relatives in the audience, the bullet carried in on a velvet cushion - so that, as the contestants raise the weapon to their temples, there is real horror and tension, as if we are actually viewing a homicidal spin-off from The X Factor. Its only weakness is that no TV company would ever commission a Russian roulette gameshow: not for moral reasons but because, if the first person to fire gets the bullet, the show will be left half-an-hour short for the slot, which no executive or advertiser would tolerate.</p> <p>But the sense that television logically moves toward the screening of that terrible linguistic paradox - a live death - has driven much of the satire about the box. In 1991, long before the rise of reality TV, Gore Vidal published Live from Golgotha, a time-slip burlesque in which the Crucifixion is televised globally as it happens.</p> <p>Since Big Brother, many writers have been inspired by a suspicion of morbidity in television. In Ben Elton's Dead Famous (2001), a housemate in an incarceration gameshow is murdered on day 27. As viewers become obsessed with solving the case, Elton sharply skewers the audience's prurient complicity in such programmes. Having been able to watch six more series of Big Brother than Elton was (during which there were racism and bullying but no murders), Christopher Brookmyre, in A Snowball in Hell, is even more damning of the format. His protagonist is a serial killer who posts films of his murders on the internet, eventually graduating to inviting public votes on whether victims should live or die.</p> <p>This rush of projects inspired by reality TV continues the pattern by which any significant development in the way the medium operates inspires a wave of fiction. America's realisation in the 1970s that television presenters were richer and more powerful than presidents led to a set of vicious films about the people who read the autocues: Network, Broadcast News and To Die For, in which Nicole Kidman's homicidally ambitious weathercaster is probably the single most appalling frontperson in fiction. In 2004, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy added a late, fart-cushion coda to this genre.</p> <p>Similarly, in Britain during the 1990s, the rise of the docu-soap, treating real people as if they were stars, soon encouraged the mock-doc sitcom, started by The Office and continued by Marion and Geoff, in which both the subject matter and the form were commenting on trends in broadcasting. In The Office, the filming convention soon became so natural that it was watched as an office comedy, but in the two specials that closed the show, the frame was widened to deal with how David Brent and the other employees had become brief national celebrities. </p> <p>Novelists such as CP Snow and John Braine charted the rise of television as a mass entertainment, and as a place for a certain type of flashy, pushy, upwardly mobile figure, inspired by the first British TV superstars, David Frost and Simon Dee. By the late 1960s, the medium became hard for a socially realistic novelist to ignore. The central character in Kingsley Amis's I Want It Now is Ronnie Appleyard, a talk show host, who hopes that his career will bring him \"fame and money with a giant's helping of sex thrown in\". This assumption that TV employees get far more shagging and cash than novelists and journalists, despite being a section of the same profession, has driven much satire of television.</p> <p>Amis was alert to the way TV challenged British class hierarchies and to the implied insincerity of the TV presenter: hosts, using their own names yet wearing makeup and costumes, are actors pretending to be themselves. Amis wrote much of the book during a teaching assignment in Tennessee. To him, the sheer prevalence of television was one of the shocks of America. Writing to his friend Robert Conquest, he noted wonderingly: \"Am sitting in front of the TV (although it's only 10.30am.)\" </p> <p>The novelist who best knows the subject from the inside, Melvyn Bragg, has drawn on his experiences in many books, including Kingdom Come and the recent Remember Me, which is unusual among TV-set fiction in not satirising the business but recording the inventiveness and optimism that were to be found as the business began to develop. </p> <p>With the exception of those by Bragg and Elton, most TV novels have been written by outsiders. But Lippman's Another Thing to Fall is an intriguing kind of inside job. Lippman is married to David Simon, creator of The Wire, the Baltimore-based crime drama that has become the most revered series of the moment. Lippman's book takes place on the set of a TV drama being filmed in Baltimore, during which a series of crimes occur. In an afterword, the author is keen to resist suggestions that she had a wire into The Wire: \"This is a work of fiction. Seriously.\" </p> <p>But the novel greatly benefits from the access she has clearly had to the language and atmosphere of TV production. From the jargon (\"sides\" for pages of script and \"honey wagon\" for chemical toilets) to the physical detail (the possibility of using an Emmy award in a crime), the story reeks with authenticity. Unusually, it is also, while aware of the industry's pomposities and immoralities, alive to its talents and achievements. In that respect, it serves as a useful corrective to most fiction about television, which tends to throw the book at the screen.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop </strong> <strong>Factor ...</strong> is on Channel 4 on Sunday at 8pm and 10.15pm</p>",
  "<p>Max Mosley believes the success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> has altered the public's perception of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> as a sport and has dismissed suggestions that the FIA, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/motorsports\">motor sport</a>'s governing body, is biased against the British driver or his McLaren team.</p> <p>\"You notice there's a whole new public who are interested in formula one, both in the UK, but even more so abroad, in all sorts of countries,\" said the FIA president. \"Because, thanks to Lewis, it's no longer seen as a white elitist sport. It has that image, inevitably, because it's so expensive to get into. </p> <p>\"He's changed all of that. He's come from a pretty ordinary background, he's black and he's very successful. For us [the sport], if he's successful, it will be excellent, really, really good for formula one. But that doesn't mean we're going to help him, and it certainly doesn't mean we're going to hinder him.\" </p> <p>Hamilton finished second in the world drivers' championship last year, his first season in formula one, and heads this year's standings by seven points going into this weekend's Japanese grand prix in Fuji after which there are just two races remaining. That lead would be more substantial but for the penalty imposed by the stewards on Hamilton at the Belgian grand prix where he was relegated from first to third place.</p> <p>Mosley conceded that the FIA had been the focal point of much criticism over the incident, but insisted that the rejection of the McLaren appeal in no way reflected any partiality on the part of the governing body. \"One's seen that over and over again,\" he said. \"What happens is, the bloggers notice if something happens that, say, disadvantages McLaren or Renault. They don't notice with Ferrari. </p> <p>\"The mechanics on [Kimi] Raikkonen's car in Monaco this year were a few seconds too long on the grid changing his tyres and he got given a drive-through [penalty]. A drive-through in Monaco, well that's it normally, and nobody noticed. </p> <p>\"Now if we'd done that to, for example, Lewis Hamilton, there would've been absolute uproar in Britain. Not in Italy, but in Britain. This time there was uproar in Italy, but not in Britain. It's the problem of the referee, you're never right. It's just a question of how much you annoy everybody, but you have to live with that.\" </p> <p>Hamilton, meanwhile, is confident of extending his lead over his championship rival Felipe Massa on Sunday. He dominated on the same circuit last year in conditions of torrential rain and poor visibility. \"I feel a lot stronger this year than I did this time last year,\" he said yesterday. \"We have three races left and we'll do everything we can as a team to come out on top.\"</p> <p>If Hamilton wins at Fuji and Massa fails to score, the British driver would be 17 points ahead with 20 points to race for over the last two races and could secure the title at the penultimate race of the year in Shanghai the following weekend. For his part, Massa remains determined to make up for his disappointing Singapore grand prix performance when he pulled away from a pit stop with the refuelling hose still attached to the side of his Ferrari, a slip which cost him a possible crucial race victory. </p> <p>\"We are seven points behind but there are 30 points in front of us, so we will fight to the last lap of the last race,\" said the Brazilian, who still hopes to join Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna as his country's fourth world champion by the time the chequered flag falls at his home circuit of Interlagos on November 2, the final race of the year.</p>",
  "<p>Demands for the recall of loans from crisis-stricken Icelandic bank Kaupthing have forced property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz to sell major stakes in J Sainsbury and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Britain's largest pub operator, realising estimated losses running to more than \u00a3800m.</p> <p>Tchenguiz lieutenants Aaron Brown and Tim Smalley were immediately removed from the board of M&amp;B, underlining the property investor's evaporating influence. Brown also left the board of SCI Entertainment, the video games group behind the Lara Croft series, in a move expected to presage an imminent disposal of some or all of Tchenguiz's 22% in that business. He may also review a 3% holding in Whitbread, the company behind the Premier Inns and Costa Coffee chains.</p> <p>Some 172m shares in J Sainsbury are believed to have been placed yesterday at 250p each, less than half the price at which Tchenguiz bought much of his holding last year in the midst of two failed takeover approaches for the supermarket group - approaches he did much to encourage. </p> <p>A Sainsbury's statement issued after markets closed last night confirmed Tchenguiz had sold 88m shares and no longer had an economic interest in a further 85m shares previously held through derivatives. It is not known who has bought the shares.</p> <p>The placing was temporarily derailed at 3pm yesterday after the Treasury, on the advice of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, seized control of Kaupthing's UK division, Kaupthing Singer Friedlander, believing it to be \"in default for the purposes of the financial services compensation scheme\". </p> <p>Moving to hive off savers' deposits, the rest of KSF was placed in administration with Ernst &amp; Young.</p> <p>Kaupthing, which had been conducting the placing of the Sainsbury's shares, is believed to have postponed the offer in the midst of much uncertainty. However, the trade was later completed.</p> <p>Last night the administrators said the rump of KSF's loan book would be managed \"to maximise recovery for creditors, including the FSCS and the Treasury\".</p> <p>Relations between the UK and Iceland are tense after chancellor Alistair Darling was yesterday forced to guarantee the deposits of all British savers who had money with closed Icelandic bank Icesave after the refusal of the country's own compensation scheme to pay out.</p> <p>Earlier almost 88m shares in M&amp;B, which includes the O'Neill's, All Bar One and Harvester chains, had been sold to an investment vehicle controlled by Joe Lewis, the Bahamas-based currency trader best known in Britain for his controlling stake in Tottenham Hotspur football club. A further batch of about 20m M&amp;B shares has been sold by Tchenguiz to Lewis, with an announcement expected soon.</p> <p>The shares are believed to have changed hands for about 130p each, realising a huge loss for Tchenguiz, who is estimated to have paid an average of about 500p a share when building his stake, and at one point paying close to 700p.</p> <p>The M&amp;B board had been pressed by Tchenguiz to sell and lease back its \u00a35bn pub property assets or to convert into a tax-efficient real estate investment trust. It will be keen to hear from its newest shareholder whether he too wants to take the business down that path. </p> <p>Before the credit crunch, Tchenguiz was Britain's most aggressive corporate agitator, waging a campaign against the dullest, most conservative boardroom strategies. Claims he could unlock billions of pounds for shareholders hidden in property freeholds brought him a formidable following.</p> <p>Foremost among his targets were J Sainsbury and M&amp;B. He built up major holdings in both and helped facilitate takeover campaigns. </p> <p>Many of Tchenguiz's other ventures are deeply intertwined with Kaupthing loans and investments. The Icelandic bank has debt and equity in Bay Restaurant Group, which includes restaurant chain La Tasca and the Slug &amp; Lettuce bars, as well as Town &amp; Country, parent company of the Yates's bar chain. The businesses were bought from administrators having been previously owned by Laurel Pub Company, a Tchenguiz-owned business that failed in March.</p> <h2>Joe '92</h2> <p>Joe Lewis, who bought M&amp;B shares from Tchenguiz, knows all too well that the value of an investment can go down as well as up. Born just before the second world war above a pub in east London, Lewis - who left school at 15 to work in his dad's cafe - earned his notoriety when, alongside George Soros, he made a fortune as a currency speculator during the pound's ejection from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. But when US investment bank Bear Stearns collapsed this year, his estimated \u00a32.8bn fortune was cut by \u00a3500m.</p>",
  "<p>Local authorities are paying more to settle pothole compensation claims from aggrieved motorists than they are spending on fixing cracks in the road, council leaders admitted yesterday.</p> <p>The Local Government Association blamed no-win, no-fee lawyers for creating a \"compensation culture\", encouraging motorists to make spurious claims for damage to vehicles.</p> <p>Councils in England and Wales paid \u00a353m in compensation to vehicle owners in 2007-8 and spent \u00a352.3m on road repairs.</p> <p>The association said the average cost of fixing a pothole is about \u00a356. The outlay on compensation would have been enough to make 966,429 repairs - more than a quarter of the estimated 3.5m holes in roads.</p> <p>Council staff spent 40,801 working days dealing with claims, instead of providing services to the general public. </p> <p>The association said: \"Council leaders fear the number of motorists making claims for damage is set to rise as the credit crunch bites and drivers increasingly feel the pinch.\" It asked the government to legislate to prevent spurious claims.</p> <p>David Sparks, chairman of the association's transport and regeneration board, said: \"Getting people safely from A to B is at the top of every council's agenda. These figures show the extent to which our efforts are being hampered by the compensation culture that exists nowadays.</p> <p>\"Since no-win, no-fee was introduced, almost all councils have seen an increase in compensation claims. Of course, where people have a legitimate claim they're entitled to compensation, but there's a real fear that no-win, no-fee lawyers are clogging up the system with spurious claims from people just chancing their arm. Tightening the law would help put a stop to this.</p> <p>\"The money councils are losing through dubious compensation claims does nothing but add to the misery of our nation's road users.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/londonwasps\">Wasps</a> yesterday laughed off this week's training-ground fight between two <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandrugbyunionteam\">England </a>backs, Josh Lewsey and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/danny-cipriani\">Danny Cipriani</a>, which left the latter felled by a right hook and nursing a cut nose and lip.</p> <p>The pair trained together yesterday having patched up their differences, which started when Lewsey criticised Cipriani for missing a tackle. Wasps, who denied that Lewsey was facing disciplinary action, described the fight as nothing unusual as players started to focus on the important <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/heinekencup\">Heineken Cup</a> opener, against Castres at Adams Park on Sunday.</p> <p>\"It was nothing out of the ordinary,\" said the Wasps director of rugby, Ian McGeechan. \"This sort of thing happens every week: I am quite chuffed that it was two backs who were involved. We are talking about rugby players after all, and it is simply not an issue.\"</p> <p>Cipriani last week made his return from injury, five months after ankle surgery. He is expected to be added to the England squad later this month and enjoys a high media profile. Lewsey is in the current England 32, but faces being dropped if Wasps continue to pick him on the left wing because his designated national position is full-back: if he is picked out of that position for three consecutive weeks, England have the right to replace him.</p> <p>Wasps moved Lewsey from full-back after mistakes under high kicks cost his side three tries in two consecutive defeats. With just one victory so far, and defeat in the opening round of the EDF Energy Cup, Europe looks Wasps' best chance of continuing their record of winning at least one trophy in each of the last six seasons.</p> <p>\"It is Heineken Cup week and we always have a fight,\" said the club's head coach, Shaun Edwards. \"We have won it twice, and each time we had a dust-up in the build-up. Players are on edge. I do not condone punching in matches because players risk getting sent off, but in training it's different because emotions can run a bit wild at times and we encourage emotion.\"</p> <p>Edwards insisted that fame had not made Cipriani arrogant and played down suggestions his profile was causing jealousy within the squad. \"Danny is treated the same as everybody else. If he is late for training he will be fined, and if his training is not up to scratch he gets told off, as everyone else does. What goes into the papers is out of our control. All that we can do is make sure that Danny leaves his ego at the door as the rest of the players do and works hard, as he has done over the last three years. No one at this club is questioning his commitment.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is a scene in Alaska, of the Mendenhall glacier near the capital, Juneau. I spent 10 days in the state, taking more than 1,200 photographs. On this occasion, I was picking my way through the undergrowth with Ishmael, this great guy who was showing me around. I had said I wanted to get to the base of the waterfall, but then I came upon this scene. It was a real wow moment.</p> <p>I realised I didn't really want to be at the base of the waterfall at all. Instead, I hung around here shooting a few frames. There was this beach shore, with the waterfall gushing down off the rocks into what has become a lake. It seemed slightly surreal, because of the layers within it, like a Photoshopped image. It was as if all the components did not naturally go together - yet they did.</p> <p>If you didn't have the bushes in the foreground, it would be harder to understand the scale, the vastness of that space. That gesture brings the artist into it; you know exactly where I'm standing. It is a slightly voyeuristic picture: who's that hiding behind the bushes?</p> <p>I noticed that there were a few figures on the shore, mostly tourists mingling about. But, as I looked more, I saw that the guy fourth from the left had his shirt off and was mugging for a camera. When you see the full-print size, you can see how he is doing that downward muscle motion of a bodybuilder. And then the other guy is kneeling and taking a photograph. Being a queer artist, I made up my own little story about how they were two lovers at this waterfall.

  "<p>The phone I bought last month has a camera supposedly better than the camera I bought four years ago. That's to say it has a 5MP camera instead of a 4MP one. I could have bought a Samsung phone with 8MP, the same as my second digital camera. And the phone does take perfectly usable pictures and recognisable videos. That it functions as well as a mapping device and a recorder is astonishing, but irrelevant to this argument. My cameras will do none of those other things. When I want to take a close-up with the most recent, and expensive, DSLR, I have to go to the trouble of changing the lens first. The phone - and the previous camera - do it all in software.</p> <p>This is all part of a revolution that has put good photography in the hands of everyone. Yet the paradox of digital photography has been that the standards of publicly acceptable photographs has plummeted. Perhaps I am spoiled, because I worked on the Independent when it first started, but I expect a newspaper photograph to give me an aesthetic thrill at the same time as it illuminates the news. The Guardian's wonderful centrespreads are an example today of what I mean, but they are very unusual. This isn't just an aesthetic argument. The influential Daily Mail demands an extraordinary flat lighting style which robs its standard portraits of any individuality, but at least they are technically clean. The quality of the digital photographs in the papers is often dreadful: screengrabs with fuzzy grey lines across them; phone shots that have been run through the ugly filter in Photoshop; in the local press, pictures are often lurid, splodgy and blurred. Sometimes these have a vitality that outweighs their flaws, but most of the time they fail the test of a good photograph.</p> <p>There is a parallel here to what happened when desktop publishing (DTP) software first appeared. Immediately, the world was swamped in ugly and uninformative layouts. It took a couple of decades before the hideous tide receded and the business was back in the hands of professionals, or of amateurs safely corralled inside templates drawn up by professionals.</p> <p>Incompetence and lack of self-discipline is only part of the story. Modern cameras make it very hard to take pictures which are out of focus or horrendously badly exposed. They can't do much about composition, though they do make it very easy to recrop and recompose in software afterwards. It's not the fault of the camera if no user does bother. Some of the new cameras will even try to find smiles in the picture and focus on them, which is a startling example of usefulness. But these are not the points that get advertised. Instead, consumer cameras sell themselves largely on their zoom range and the megapixel count. These are measures which can actively worsen the pictures they can take. When you are judging a camera's sensor, size is about the only thing that counts. Fewer pixels on a bigger sensor will usually take better pictures than more pixels on a smaller sensor. There will be less \"noise\" - speckles in darker areas - and greater sensitivity to light. Similarly, a zoom that extends to 10 times its original size may make a man feel good, but it won't be as sharp anywhere along its range as one that is less grotesquely enlarged.</p> <p>So millions of cameras have been sold in the past five years where the technical improvements did very little to deliver better pictures. The advantages of digital over film cameras was not that they delivered better images but that they made things easier, quicker and cheaper.</p> <p>That is now changing, even in the almost affordable sections of the market. The other day I saw Brian Harris, whose moody black and white pictures gave the early Independent much of its style. He was clutching a new Nikon D700, which costs around \u00a32,000 - yet has \"only\" 12MP. But these pixels are on a sensor the same size as 35mm film, which is about 50% larger than the sensors of consumer DSLRs, and the result is a camera that is actually better at low-light photography than anything he could manage with film. He had just spent four days shooting backstage at the National Theatre without any flash at all. Technology has finally caught up with where it started.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://thewormbook.com/helmintholog \">thewormbook.com/helmintholog </a></p>",
  "<p>Businesses and consumers across the world must brace themselves for tough times, as the yearlong financial crisis tips almost all big economies into recession, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday.</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's economic counsellor, welcomed the coordinated cuts in interest rates from six central banks, including the Bank of England, and taxpayer-backed bailouts of struggling banks. </p> <p>\"It is clear that there will be tough economic times ahead,\" Blanchard said as he unveiled the IMF's half-yearly health check of the global economy in Washington. He said that financial markets were in the grip of \"a downward spiral of loss of confidence and trust,\" and government rescue plans would take time to work.</p> <p>\"The re-establishment of trust or, more formally, the decline in counterparty risk within the financial system, will take time. During that time, credit to the ultimate borrowers will be limited and expensive.\"</p> <p>The IMF's bleak warning came as Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said the credit crunch had also created a \"human crisis\" in many of the poorest countries, which required a coordinated response. He said the number of malnourished people was expected to increase by 44 million this year, to 967 million, as a result of high food prices. </p> <p>Despite its pessimistic assessment, the IMF said the risk of a new Great Depression was small. It expects 9% growth in China, 7% in India, and 6% in Africa to partly offset the weakness in the west. Overall, the IMF is forecasting 3% growth in the global economy, the slowest since the downturn that followed the dotcom crash.</p> <p>Blanchard said the severity of the crisis meant that governments would be forced to adopt coherent plans in the near future. \"Under that assumption, I believe that the risk of a Great Depression is nearly nil.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bruce Conner, who has died aged 74, played a significant role in the underground art movement that originated in the US towards the end of the 1950s, though he might have been better known and wealthier had he been less suspicious of the \"conservative art gallery system\", stayed off the booze and drugs, and concentrated his energies.</p> <p>Although his work ranged from assemblage pieces - collage sculptures made from nylon stockings, parts of furniture, broken dolls, fur, costume jewellery, paint, photographs and candles, reclaiming objects that had been discarded and neglected - to mysterious mandala designs, photograms of his own body, ink-blot, Rorschach-like drawings and avant-garde films, all had a blend of humour, iconoclasm and intransigence.</p> <p>Always afraid of selling out, Conner, as a committed oppositional artist, gradually withdrew from the art world in the late 1970s after he became part of the San Francisco punk scene, working as a staff photographer for the \"punkzine\" Search and Destroy. During that time, he spent most of his nights at a club called the Mabuhay. \"I lost a lot of brain cells at the Mabuhay,\" he explained. \"What are you gonna do listening to hours of incomprehensible rock'n'roll but drink? I became an alcoholic, and it took me a few years to deal with that.\" Yet, despite the woozy atmosphere, he delivered sharp and characterful photos.</p> <p>Conner was born in McPherson, Kansas. He attended Wichita University, then graduated with a BA in fine arts at the University of Nebraska, where he met Jean Sandstedt, whom he married in 1957. He won a scholarship to the Brooklyn Museum art school and then spent a year on an art course at the University of Colorado, which he flunked. The couple moved to San Francisco, where Conner got involved with the beat generation, before moving to Mexico for two years because \"it was cheap\". It was there that he found magic mushrooms with his friend, LSD guru Timothy Leary. However, he and his wife ran out of money and returned to San Francisco.</p> <p>Influenced by dada and surrealism and the found objects of Marcel Duchamp, Conner first gained attention with his assemblage art, exhibiting at the Alan gallery in New York. His movie-making dated back to when he ran a film society at the University of Colorado. He invited Stan Brakhage to show his experimental films there, and Brakhage advised Conner to make films. The consequence was Movie (1958), a 12-minute collage of stock or found footage which moves from the comic (crazy races, a chase scene involving cars and cowboys) to the disturbing (shivering refugees, an execution, air crashes), questioning the way we view a film.</p> <p>There are 2,000 images in the four minutes of Cosmic Ray (1961), which cuts together footage of fireworks, atom bombs, Mickey Mouse and nude dancing girls, all to Ray Charles singing What'd I Say on the soundtrack. With money from the Ford Foundation, Conner made a number of very short films over the next few years, precursors, for better or worse, of the pop video and MTV.</p> <p>Easter Morning Raga (1966) was designed to be run forward or backward at any speed, or even in a loop to a background of sitar music. Breakaway (1966) showed a dancer, Antonia Christina Basilotta, in rapid rhythmic montage. Report (1967) dwells on the assassination of John F Kennedy. The found footage exists of repetitions, jump cuts and broken images of the motorcade, and disintegrates at the crucial moment while we hear a frenzied television commentator saying that \"something has happened\". The fatal gun shots are intercut with other shots: TV commercials, clips from James Whale's Frankenstein and Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front. The film has both a kinetic and emotional effect.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the critical success of these films and the interest they created did not please Conner. \"I've always been uneasy about being identified with the art I've made,\" he stated. \"Art takes on a power all its own and it's frightening to have things floating around the world with my name on them that people are free to interpret and use however they choose.\" In fact, he decided to make a film \"to ruin my reputation as a film-maker\". It was called Leader (since destroyed) and consisted of a dramatised recording of American soldiers captured by the Nazis in which Conner highlights the phrase \"We've gotta get out of here\" by repeating it multiple times in the hope that the audience would act accordingly.</p> <p>In 1967, he had his first experience of commercial film-making when he shot a 14-minute film on location during the making of Cool Hand Luke, starring Paul Newman, in which his friend Dennis Hopper had a small role. It was released unedited (Hopper claimed that \"much of the editing of Easy Rider came directly from watching Bruce's films\").</p> <p>Conner continued to make his own short films including Crossroads (1976) in which the 1952 atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll becomes a thing of terrible beauty when shown in extreme slow motion from 27 different angles. As countercultural as ever, one of his last films was America Is Waiting (1981), which lampoons US military might to a song by Brian Eno and David Byrne.</p> <p>He is survived by Jean and their son Robert.</p> <p>\u2022 Bruce Conner, artist and film-maker, born November 18 1933; died July 7 2008</p>",

The former British champion asked a group in a west London bar to stop smoking, three weeks after the public ban came into force in July last year. Mulenga denied firing four shots, one of which hit Oyebola's leg and one which pierced his carotid artery, but was convicted 9-1 by the jury; he faces life when sentenced today at the Old Bailey. Two men were cleared of murder after giving evidence for the prosecution, while a fourth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will face a separate trial. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>July 7 inquiry detectives raid Leeds house</h2> <p>Detectives raided a house in Leeds yesterday as part of inquiries into the July 7 suicide bombings in London which killed 52 people. Officers arrived at the property in the Harehills area of Leeds at around 7am. Police said the person who currently lives in the flat, believed to have been moved to a hotel, was not linked in any way to the inquiry. Detective Assistant Commissioner John McDowall said: \"As a result of our inquiries we are carrying out an extensive search of the flat to determine whether there are any links to the people responsible for the 7/7 attacks.\" <br><strong>Sandra Laville</strong></p> <h2>TLS poetry editor wins \u00a310,000 Forward prize</h2> <p>A sweeping poetic history of Scotland which was 20 years in the making was last night named winner of Britain's most important poetry prize. Mick Imlah, the poetry editor of the Times Literary Supplement, won the \u00a310,000 Forward prize for best collection. The Lost Leader is Imlah's only collection of poems since he published Birthmarks in 1988. Also named as winners at a prizegiving in central London were Kathryn Simmonds who won the best first collection prize, for Sunday at the Skin Launderette; and Don Paterson who won best single poem, for Love Poem For Natalie \"Tusja\" Beridze. <br><strong>Mark Brown</strong></p> <h2>ITV seeks public funding for local news output</h2> <p>ITV chairman Michael Grade yesterday backed a plan that would see regional news paid for from the public purse. Under the plan, floated by Ofcom in the second stage of its public service broadcasting review, Grade said ITV could make half an hour a day available to another news provider. He said ITN, in which ITV has a 40% stake, would be an obvious choice but that he would be equally happy to see another provider - such as Reuters or PA - provide the content. Last month Ofcom gave ITV the green light to merge its regional news programmes in England and the Scottish borders from 17 to nine. <br><strong>Owen Gibson</strong></p> <h2>Bishop gives ultimatum over gay adoption</h2> <p>A Catholic bishop has warned of \"tragic consequences\" for adoption agencies offering services to gay couples. Patrick O'Donoghue said he found it \"unthinkable, indeed, heart-breaking\" that Catholic Caring Services in Preston would \"capitulate\" to same-sex adoption legislation, which comes into effect next January and requires agencies to treat same-sex partnerships in an identical manner to married, heterosexual couples. In a letter to trustees, O'Donoghue told them if they insisted on considering same-sex adoption he would strip the agency of its Catholic ties. <br><strong>Riazat Butt</strong></p> <h2>One of the first Sky News presenters dies at 70</h2> <p>Bob Friend, one of the presenters who launched Sky News, died yesterday after suffering from a brain tumour, the channel said. Friend, 70, was \"a distinguished journalist and an admired broadcaster\", said Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation. Friend had several cameo roles as a newscaster in movies such as Independence Day and Mission Impossible. He started as a cub reporter aged 15 on the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser, covering street parties to mark the Coronation. He spent 20 years with the BBC after joining in 1969, and reported from Northern Ireland for four years. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",
  "<p>Violent crime in Latin America kills more people and wreaks more economic havoc than Aids, the head of the Organisation of American States warned this week. Drug trafficking, gang warfare, kidnapping and other crimes pose one of the gravest threats to the region's stability, said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza. \"It is an epidemic, a plague on our continent that kills more people than Aids or any other known epidemic. It destroys more homes than any economic crisis.\" </p> <p>The warning came amid a backdrop of horrific violence in Mexico, where drug cartels are waging war against the state, and evidence that cities from Caracas to Buenos Aires are becoming more dangerous.</p> <p>The number of people killed by gun crime in central and south America is four times the world average, according to UN estimates, with a homicide rate of more than 25 per 100,000 people. In parts of El Salvador, Guatemala and Venezuela the rate is more than 100 per 100,000.</p> <p>The violence has been blamed on factors including poverty, inequality, cocaine trafficking, the legacy of civil wars, a bountiful supply of guns and corrupt, ineffective state institutions, notably the police, prisons and courts.</p> <p>Anger at crime and distrust of the police often leads to lynchings, with several suspects recently beaten and hacked to death in Bolivia, Guatemala and Peru. There are even grimmer stories from jails which are controlled by inmates.</p> <p>Rigoberta Menchu, Guatemala's human rights activist and Nobel laureate, has referred to crime as a cancer.</p> <p>Crime stories, often accompanied by grisly images, dominate media coverage and rank at or near the top of public concerns. Most victims are impoverished slum-dwellers but the perception of danger still hinders tourism and investment, with several Caribbean countries feeling the sting of recent high-profile murders. </p> <p>Some studies suggest Latin America\"s income could be 25% higher if its crime rate, which began soaring in the 1980s, was similar to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Aids, in contrast, has stayed largely in check, with HIV prevalence remaining at under 1% in most countries.</p> <p>Insulza made his dramatic warning at a two-day security meeting of the OAS in Mexico City. He praised the host government's controversial decision to deploy 20,000 soldiers against powerful drug cartels, a move which provoked a vicious backlash. Thousands have died, the state has lost control of several areas and headless bodies are discovered with numbing regularity.</p> <p>Mexico's president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, called for a pan-regional database on criminals and a \"continental front\" which would include the US. \"We must attack simultaneously not only drug smuggling, but the world's main market,\" he said. </p> <p>Some countries, such as Costa Rica, are relatively untouched by the violence and in Colombia, once-notorious cities such as Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn have enjoyed a renaissance as leftwing insurgency has ebbed before a US-supported military offensive. Brazil's favelas, however, remain killing zones for gangs and police and a perceived crime wave in Argentina has driven anxious middle-class families into South Africa-style gated communities.</p>",
  "<p>The government is lobbying to weaken new European laws to force car manufacturers to build cleaner vehicles, leaked documents have revealed.</p> <p>The UK has already been criticised for campaigning to water down another key European commission environmental policy to generate one-fifth of energy from renewable sources.</p> <p>Now a briefing document from the Department for Transport to MEPs urges them to support three amendments to the commission's proposal to limit emissions from new cars to 120g of carbon dioxide for every kilometre travelled by 2012.</p> <p>The UK-supported changes include plans to phase in the new limit over three years; to extend the less difficult targets for small manufacturers to include more companies - including potentially Jaguar, Land Rover and Ferrari; and to allow \"eco-innovations\" which are not part of the formal emissions tests to be allowed towards the target. These might include solar roofs and more widespread use of sixth gears.</p> <p>The briefing, seen by the Guardian, indicates support for similar proposals by the French and German governments and would mean it was all but certain they will be adopted by the council of ministers because the three countries and their allies control such a big chunk of votes, said Franziska Achterberg, European transport campaigner for Greenpeace.</p> <p>\"If the UK joins [France and Germany], the small countries would not be sufficient to get a better outcome,\" said Achterberg. </p> <p>The impact of phasing in the target would be for average emissions to be 154g/km in the first year, reducing towards the 120g target by 2015, said Achterberg. Critics also claim it would not be feasible for the commission to test the claims for emissions reductions for eco-innovations made by manufacturers, although the UK government proposals stress they should be \"robust and measurable\". The car industry has already been criticised for missing a previous voluntary agreement promise to cut emissions to 140g/km by the end of this year. Yesterday the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said average new car emissions had fallen to 158.6g/km in the UK, just above the Europe-wide figure last year.</p> <p>\"The problem is transport emissions are still rising; if we don't do something on cars and fuel this is not going to stop, so all the efforts to reduce emissions in other sectors will be undermined,\" added Achterberg. Last night the DfT said the proposed changes would not have a significant impact on emissions but would help manufacturers with long cycles between research and development on more efficient technology and new models, especially small companies with less flexibility to offset more polluting cars against cleaner models. </p> <p>The UK was also going further than the commission by supporting a new limit of 100g/km in 2020, said a spokeswoman.</p> <p>The SMMT said the car industry, which employs 850,000 people in the UK, was struggling to cope with falling sales. \"It is very appropriate that today we do address the sustainability of the automotive industry, and perhaps remind ourselves that economic and social impacts are as important as environmental considerations,\" said Paul Everitt, the society's chief executive.</p>",
  "<p>She is the poshest woman in Spain, a grandee with such extensive estates that she can reputedly cross the country without once leaving the lands accumulated by her aristocratic family over five centuries. </p> <p>Now the flamboyant Duchess of Alba has, at 82, found herself at the centre of a row involving a younger lover, wedding plans, her disapproving children and claims that she may be losing her mind. </p> <p>Her six children have publicly denied asking a court to declare the love-struck octogenarian mentally incompetent in order to prevent her marrying a suave antique collector called Alfonso D\u00edez - who is 24 years her junior.</p> <p>\"They have not initiated court proceedings to have their mother the Duchess of Alba, whom they respect profoundly, declared incompetent,\" a statement issued in the children's names said.</p> <p>News that Mar\u00eda del Rosario Cayetana Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Francisca Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva - as the duchess is also known - had been hatching a secret plan to marry D\u00edez sent Spain's gossip industry into a frenzy of speculation last month.</p> <p>Reports soon circulated of a family bust-up as the duchess herself held forth about her children's hypocrisy, and leaked medical documents suggested she may not be entirely in control of her actions.</p> <p>\"It is true that we thought of marrying,\" she told Hola! Magazine last month. \"The difficult thing was that my children did not understand ... I must admit that I got very angry,\" said the duchess, pointing out that her children - five of whom are divorced - changed partners far more frequently than she had ever done. A press statement from the House of Alba later denied that a wedding was planned.</p> <p>The duchess has long been a staple of Spain's gossip industry and has frequently been pictured with bullfighters and flamenco dancers.

  "<p><strong>I am 31 and have been seeing my boyfriend for six years; he is 30. He has a busy job, which takes him all around the world, and he is hugely focused on his career. I would very much like to get married, and have attempted to discuss the subject with him on a number of occasions over the past few years, but he refuses to give me a straight answer. My friends say that when they try to broach the matter with him, he becomes uncomfortable and evasive. His response to any conversation that touches on the issue is to defer any decision-making for a further two years, saying we can talk about marriage then.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have reluctantly accepted this because I don't want to lose him, but my friends are concerned that he is messing me around and they have asked me what I think he is waiting for exactly. They have asked me why he finds it necessary to postpone even discussing it, if he intends us to get married eventually, or at the very least has not ruled out the possibility. They point out that, even if he feels it is too early for us to marry at the moment, that doesn't stop us getting engaged, thus making a commitment to do so. They fear that I am risking tremendous disappointment in the future, having already invested years of my life in this relationship, in the hope that it will proceed to a lasting partnership and marriage.</strong></p> <p><strong>Are my friends being cynical, or am I being naive? </strong></p> <h2>Threaten to leave</h2> <p>He needs to think that he might lose you. Otherwise, why shouldn't he put you off for another six years? I was in a similar situation and had been living with my boyfriend for five years, during which time he dodged all discussions of marriage. Eventually I prepared to move out and put a deposit on my own flat rental. He proposed a week later.<br><strong>LC, via email</strong></p> <h2>He won't change</h2> <p>Does your boyfriend eventually want marriage? No, he doesn't. Why would he? He already has everything he wants - a job he loves, a \"base\" for when he is not travelling, a supportive yet independent partner. He is only 30 and has all the time in the world to settle down and procreate, unlike you.</p> <p>Accept that you have as much commitment from him as you are going to get, and ask yourself if it is enough. Only you can know the answer to that. I suspect you already do. <br><strong>Carla Staton, Crewe</strong></p> <h2>The problem is you, not him</h2> <p>Your problem reeks of self-doubt and lack of confidence, and perhaps it is this that needs addressing. Be brave and ask yourself this: why do you want to be with a man who isn't giving you what you need? If he is putting his job before you and doesn't want to get married, what is the future for you both? I am puzzled by this \"two-year\" embargo. Are you really happy to let somebody have such control over your life? It sounds as if you need to learn what is right for you.<br><strong>Nicola Handyside, London</strong></p> <h2>It is time to leave</h2> <p>What is the point of being in a relationship with someone who refuses to discuss your future together? It seems that he does not want to marry you, or even become engaged: if he did, he would at least sit down and discuss it with you. </p> <p>I was engaged for three years to someone who wanted to get a ring on my finger, but did not want to set a date. I left him three years ago and have not looked back since.</p> <p>Women tend to stay in relationships far longer than they need to, because they have invested time, love and energy. But if you are not getting worthwhile returns, it is time to leave. You are still young and will find someone else.<br><strong>Georgina Copeland, via email</strong></p> <h2>Listen to your friends</h2> <p>You are very lucky to have such a caring and supportive group of friends; you obviously respect their opinions and are right to do so. Importantly, you describe your feelings of dissatisfaction first, and use the voice of \"the chorus\" as further evidence. You say you want a serious commitment; six years is a long time to be in a relationship that is not demonstrating signs of one. He is showing a basic lack of respect by refusing to discuss the matter with you; it is juvenile and selfish. Staying in a relationship like this will continue to erode your self-confidence and sense of worth. </p> <p>A break-up will be painful, but it sounds inevitable, and you have a good support group to help you through it. The empowerment you will feel when you have taken charge of your life will provide a solid platform from which to build more meaningful relationships. <br><strong>Eleanor Kent, via email</strong></p> <h2>Why is marriage so important?</h2> <p>Your partner clearly has no intention of marrying you - but that doesn't mean he won't spend his life committed to you.</p> <p>Why is a ring and the title \"Mrs\" so important, when you are already in a long-term, committed relationship? Does your faith require your union to be blessed by your god? Do you feel \"abnormal\" as your friends have conformed to the social norm of \"I do\" and you haven't? If you want to stay with this man, you need to find what is at the root of your need for the marriage ceremony, then see if it can be addressed without a wedding ring.</p> <p>I am not married to my partner of 20 years. I have chosen not to marry as I rejoice in the fact that we are together because we choose to be, not because we signed a piece of paper. It is my choice, and it may be your partner's choice too - perhaps he is too scared to tell you as it conflicts so deeply with your ideals.</p> <p>After being nagged by you, and harangued by your friends to enter into an arrangement he does not want, your partner is still with you. He loves you. He just does not love the institution of marriage.<br><strong>Jane Radcliffe, Winchester</strong></p> <h2>What the expert thinks: Linda Blair</h2> <p>You have told us that you have been with your boyfriend for six years, and it sounds as if you get on well. You respect one another's individuality, and allow one another to develop your own interests and careers. That means you are already - and have been for some time - committed to one another.</p> <p>The confounding factor in your dilemma is the interference of your friends, and your apparent readiness to feel concerned when they raise issues about your relationship. They are the ones who seem to be suggesting that your boyfriend may be \"messing you around\" - I did not notice you introducing this idea. Furthermore, the fact that they have tried to broach the subject of marriage with him seems extremely invasive behaviour. Isn't this a matter for the two of you only?</p> <p>Your friends also seem to have confused the idea of \"commitment\" with \"marriage\". </p> <p>It is not necessary to marry to show commitment, and many couples who marry do not remain committed or faithful. Marriage does not necessarily guarantee anything - it certainly does not guarantee a lasting partnership.</p> <p>I'm sorry to hear that your friends have suggested - and you seem to have accepted - that your \"investment\" in this relationship won't pay off unless it ends in marriage. </p> <p>If you consider your relationship to be some sort of investment that demands a particular pay-off, not only will you trivialise the commitment you already have to one another, but you will also put yourself in danger of regarding the preceding six years as mere waiting time until your \"real\" life begins once you are engaged or married. This is nonsense. You are living a good life right now.</p> <p>I hope you can understand your boyfriend's behaviour better now. When your friends talk to him about marriage, are you surprised that he becomes \"uncomfortable and evasive\"? He is bound to feel trapped and defensive. Hopefully, you can find a way to let your friends know that you would prefer to handle this matter yourself, without their help or advice. Once this is clear to your boyfriend, he will start to feel less ambushed. That is when you two can really start to talk, and you can find out why he avoids the topic of marriage whenever you bring it up.</p> <p>Your aim will not be to discover whether and when he plans to marry you, but why he seems uncomfortable talking about marriage. Did his parents have a miserable relationship? Does he have friends who have had dreadful experiences and who have warned him off getting married? Is there a chance that he was unhappily married before he met you, and has been afraid to tell you? Or does he want to postpone even thinking about marriage until he doesn't feel any outside pressure to do so? There could be any number of reasons for his reluctance and reticence.</p> <p>Once you understand his motivations, you are both likely to feel more relaxed about this matter. Only then, if you still have different views about getting married, can you start looking for a compromise.</p> <h2>Next week: I can't deal with my friend being my boss</h2> <p>Over the past couple of years, I have been lucky enough to make a really good friend of a work colleague. We see each other socially, our partners have become friends, and sharing confidences and hopes for the future has made us emotionally close.</p> <p>Recently she applied for, and got, a promotion that has made her my boss. I knew this was going to be strange, but it has upset me far more than I foresaw. Following the principle that, while you cannot always control events, you can control your reaction to them, I have tried to focus on the positive aspects of the change: I am genuinely pleased for her success and it is good that there is still someone at work who knows and likes me. However, I have not been able to shake off the distress at the alteration in a relationship that I cherished, and the sense of betrayal that she put her career above our friendship.</p> <p>I now avoid seeing her outside work and I know I have become sulky and withdrawn in her presence. Even looking at her makes me feel angry, and I am surprised by my childish reaction. I have started applying for other jobs, but it just adds to my anger that I feel compelled to leave my job because of someone else's actions.</p> <p>I am struggling to understand why I can't adapt to this change and why it is causing me so much stress. How can I reclaim my friendship and my peace of mind?</p> <p>\u2022 Private Lives appears every Thursday. You are invited to respond to next week's problem.

  "<p>During a military, political and diplomatic career of more than 40 years, the former Sri Lankan Major General Janaka Perera was not afraid to make enemies. His death, at the age of 62, along with at least 27 others, came when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Anuradhapura office of the country's main opposition party, the United National party (UNP). Blame was immediately attributed to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (or Tamil Tigers), upon whom he had visited several battlefield defeats in the 1990s. But Perera took on all opponents, right across Sri Lanka's ethnic and ideological spectrum. </p> <p>Born in British colonial Ceylon, he was educated at the prestigious St Joseph's Catholic school in the capital, Colombo. In 1966, he gave up studying geology at the University of Ceylon to join the army as an officer cadet, and, after training at Sandhurst, became a second lieutenant in the Ceylon Engineers. Later, he attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in Britain, and the Defence Services Staff College in India.</p> <p>When the British departed Ceylon in 1948, they left behind an island whose majority ethnic group, the Sinhalese, were mainly Buddhist and concentrated in the south, central and western sectors of the island. The predominantly Hindu Tamil community lived in the northern Jaffna peninsula and along the east coast. During the 1950 and 60s, nationalistic Sinhalese governments had pursued policies that served to push the two groups apart. By the 1970s, a far-left insurgent group called the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (National Liberation Front or JVP) was agitating for revolution among the disaffected Sinhalese youth. Meanwhile in the north, moderate Tamil politicians were sidelined by militants calling for an independent Tamil state. </p> <p>Lieutenant Perera first saw action when the JVP tried to launch a \"one-day revolution\" in April 1971. Although they had no experience in counter-insurgency, the security forces quickly crushed the movement, but the crackdown left around 15,000 civilians dead or missing (despite the JVP's estimated membership of only 2,000).</p> <p>He was promoted to captain in 1973, and when the JVP launched an even bloodier uprising in 1987, he was again in the forefront of the counter-insurgency campaign, this time as a colonel. Through strikes and assassinations of government employees, the JVP made much of southern Sri Lanka ungovernable for two years, and again the government response was ruthless. In November 1989, he led the team that captured the JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera at his home near Kandy. He is reported to have been killed a few days later, after which the insurrection collapsed - though its suppression, involving paramilitary groups, possibly cost twice as many lives as the 1971 crackdown.</p> <p>However, it was his tenure as a senior officer fighting the Tamils in the north that cemented Perera's reputation. By the early 1990s, they established a mini-state in the Jaffna peninsula, complete with courts, banks and their own police force. They also began moving away from the traditional hit-and-run guerrilla tactics to those of a conventional army. Much of the most ferocious fighting was at Elephant Pass, a key government base located on the bottleneck of land connecting the Jaffna peninsula with the rest of the island.</p> <p>Realising the need to upgrade and diversify military operations, in 1990 Perera was instrumental in raising the Independent Brigade, comprising special forces and commandos, and served as its commander for four and a half years. He also served as a brigade commander in the north-eastern Weli Oya region and general officer commanding the 23 and 51 Divisions of the Sri Lankan army.</p> <p>After the 1994-95 ceasefire with the Tamil Tigers broke down, the army launched Operation Riviresa (Sunray) to bring the entire Jaffna peninsula under government control. As commander of the elite 53 Division, Perera played a key role in capturing Jaffna city in October 1995, after the Tigers emptied it of its civilian population (although most returned over the following year).</p> <p>In April 1996, with approximately 35,000 soldiers holding the peninsula, Perera was promoted to major general. Three years later, he was appointed commander of the Commando and Special Forces Regiment, by which time the Tamil Tigers had regrouped south of the Jaffna peninsula, cutting off all land routes to the south.</p> <p>In April 2000, the army suffered a devastating defeat when the Tigers overran Elephant Pass and advanced to just 45km east of Jaffna city. The government forces narrowly avoided having to evacuate the peninsula, and in the aftermath Perera was appointed overall commander in the north with the objective of reversing the setback.</p> <p>Although he was appointed chief of staff that same year, he was subsequently passed over for promotion to army commander, prompting his resignation in 2001. He then served as Sri Lanka's high commissioner to Australia (2001-05) and Indonesia (2005-07). His time in Australia attracted protests by Tamils resident in the country, who accused him of complicity in the disappearance of hundreds of civilians after the capture of Jaffna. He was recalled from Indonesia before his term of office was complete.</p> <p>Perera became active in opposition politics and, earlier this year, stood as the UNP candidate for the post of chief minister of the north-central province. He gained the most preferential votes but failed to win a majority in the council.</p> <p>Although the recipient of more than a dozen gallantry medals, he was outspoken in his attacks on the Colombo government and critical of the provincial election as being marred by violence. Last April, his criticisms caused him to be barred from all army camps. He accused the government and military of hubris, warning that its objective of eradicating the Tamil Tigers by 2009 was unrealistic and likely to provoke further suicide attacks. The UNP favoured a more conciliatory approach.</p> <p>With the army currently poised to capture the de-facto Tiger capital of Killinochchi, his warning has been validated by his own death. His wife Vajira, a former army officer in the women's corps whom he married in 1982, was also killed in the blast. They are survived by their four children, a son living in Sri Lanka and two daughters and a son studying in Australia.</p> <p>\u2022 Janaka Perera, soldier and politician, born February 1 1946; died October 6 2008</p>",
  "<p>The more I learn about wildlife the more I realise just how little I know, and such was the case recently. The reason for my visit to a local farmer was to photograph a mounted wildcat that had been shot around 100 years ago outside our house. The specimen was rather worn but was very impressive, particularly as it had a young rabbit in its mouth. The talk turned to the changes that had taken place in the strath and the farmer told me that his grandmother, who used to live in our house, had an intriguing way of taking grouse from the field nearby. She would crouch in a stook, a circular arrangement of cut grain stalks, and when the grouse landed to feed on the grain she would grab one. My comment was that they would have been black grouse, which were much commoner in those days - and in any case red grouse do not feed on stooks. </p> <p>My first sighting of black grouse was back in the late 1960s when I was warden on a national nature reserve near Lochinver. Black grouse bred in the woodland on one side of the house, and at the right time of the year I could see them feeding on the stooks on another side of the house. Now in various parts of the Highlands they are subject to management plans trying to restore their former numbers. Some are successful but others fail because we cannot control one of the factors responsible for their decline - the weather that adversely affects the insects the young chicks need.</p> <p>I mentioned the unusual way of catching the grouse to another farmer in the village, and he said they would have been red grouse. I stood by my original thoughts, and then the latest New Naturalist book, entitled Grouse... landed on my desk. The first photograph I saw was of red grouse feeding on stooks, taken by Adam Watson in about 1960.</p>",
  "<p>As if there were not enough real enemies to fight, the United States has been at war with itself in recent years. They call it the culture war. It has generated more hot air than most real wars in history. John McCain has now turned to its red army tactics to rescue himself from impending defeat - and Sarah Palin is his Katyusha.</p> <p>\"There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America,\" declared the conservative nationalist Pat Buchanan at the Republican national convention in 1992. \"It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself.\" Later that year he explained that \"the Bosnia of the cultural war is abortion\". As Buchanan foresaw, this has been a war for power: not military power, but the kind that comes from shaping the norms, beliefs and values by which people live, and the meanings attached to words like liberalism, patriotism or, indeed, culture. The two sides in this war came to be labelled red and blue, after the colouring of Republican and Democratic states on electoral maps.</p> <p>No one has generated more hot air in this cause than Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly, who in 2006 published a book proudly called Culture Warrior. He describes the culture war as a battle between traditionalists (\"T-Warriors\") like himself and \"the committed forces of the secular-progressive movement that want to change America dramatically: mold it in the image of western Europe\". Like Europe! God, how horrible.</p> <p>O'Reilly labels these secular-progressive forces \"S-P\", and identifies George Soros as \"El Jefe of the S-P forces\". In a fashion disturbingly familiar to any student of the 20th century, he illustrates this passage with an unflattering photo of the financier-philanthropist, captioned \"George Soros, S-P Jefe, puppet master, and moneyman\". \"Born George Schwartz to a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930,\" he explains, \"Soros assumed the identity of a gentile boy when the Nazis invaded at the start of world war II.\" This is what they call a Fox Fact. (It was Soros's father who changed the family name in 1936 and the Nazis did not invade Hungary until 1944: three errors in the space of one innuendo.) Anyway, what should that personal history have to do with an argument about cultural and social policies in 21st-century America?</p> <p>Excoriating \"leftwing outfits like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Company\" (Foxy Fact-checking again: it's the British Broadcasting Corporation), O'Reilly pounds the hot buttons of the culture war with a ham fist: abortion, drugs, gay marriage, not celebrating Christmas, atheism, the liberal or - as he prefers - \"S-P\" media and elites. The New York Times, he says in an afterword to the paperback edition, has \"morphed into a brochure for secular-progressive causes\". And so it goes on. And on.</p> <p>Does this matter? Over the past decade it has mattered a lot. The framing of the political debate in cultural conservative terms - a counter-revolution against the cultural revolution of 1968 - contributed significantly to George Bush's election victories in 2000 and 2004. And one way of understanding the direction taken by the McCain campaign over the past few weeks is this: only the culture war can win it for us now. On Iraq, we lose. On the economy, we lose. But by caricaturing the liberal otherness of a candidate called Barack Obama, perhaps we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p> <p>Enter Sarah Palin, the Katyusha rocket of red America. (I trust she won't mind a Russian analogy since, as she has informed us, you - or at least she - can see Russia from Alaska.) The selection of such an obviously under-qualified candidate for vice-president can only be explained by electoral calculation, and that calculation has everything to do with the politics of the country's cultural civil war. Her kind of down-home populist inveighing against Washington elites (add \"liberal\" or \"S-P\" according to taste) is part of the well-tried semantic armoury of the red army.</p> <p>Katyusha Palin now leads the attacks on Obama. This week she has repeatedly tried to tar-and-feather him by association with former terrorist William Ayers. The not-even-subliminal message is: he's not like us, he's like them. The others: elites, liberals, subversives, immigrants and infidels, closet Europeans! Chapter one of O'Reilly's Culture Warrior begins with an imagined 2020 state of the union speech by a president of the United States called Gloria Hernandez: hispanic, and a woman to boot. Worse still, she celebrates the United States as \"a diversified nation striving to be at peace with the world\". How terrifying. How blood-curdling. Give us President Palin any day.</p> <p>For Gloria Hernandez read Barack Obama. Or \"that one\", as McCain disrespectfully referred to him in Tuesday night's presidential debate. At the moment, the tactic isn't working. This election is about the economy, stupid. The pocketbook trumps the prayer book. However much McCain lauds himself as a \"maverick\", he can't disassociate himself from eight years of Republican rule that are ending in the biggest financial crisis since 1929 and a near-doubling of the national debt. And Obama is better on the economy: clearer, more specific, always bringing it back to the everyday struggles of ordinary Americans. In the instant-reaction polls, a clear majority thought Obama won that debate, as he is winning in most of the polls both nationwide and in key battleground states.</p> <p>Even if the red-clawed tactics of culture war don't pull Obama down at the last minute, an Obama victory won't spell the end of this war. But perhaps it may spell the beginning of the end. Let's be clear: this war will not finish with a victory of blue over red, or vice versa. It will finish with the accepted, peaceful coexistence in one society of different faiths, value systems and lifestyles - along the lines laid down centuries ago by the classical liberalism of John Locke and others, which so much influenced this country's Founding Fathers. It won't be \"liberals\" (in the perverted sense in which that word is now used in the United States) trouncing conservatives, but classical liberalism re-made for the 21st century. It won't be blue obliterating red, but red, white and blue - as in Obama's healing promise earlier in this campaign, that there are not red states and blue states, just the United States.</p> <p>The world needs the United States to get over its cultural civil war, and get over it fast. Not that these moral, cultural and social issues are unimportant. They are among the most important things. But they are also among the most private things. The business of government and the law should be confined to providing a liberal (in the classical sense) framework in which men and women can make personal choices about private goods. That should be only a small part of what government does. By contrast, the central business of government is to provide public goods such as national and personal security, the regulation of markets in which private enterprise can flourish, the international development that is in all our national interests, and a clean environment using diversified, sustainable energy supplies. That's what the United States needs from its new president, and that's what the world needs from the United States.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Last week I headed down to a press event at the 24 Club in Soho to get some hands-on time with Quantum of Solace, Treyarch's videogame tie-in with the forthcoming Bond movie. I wasn't expecting much \u2013 since GoldenEye, the 007 games been grindingly mediocre, intent on cramming in as many Bond clich\u00e9s as possible, thereby providing hopelessly confused and diluted gaming experiences. </p> <p>This one might be different. Utilising the Call of Duty 4 engine and based on elements from both Casino Royale and Quantum, we're promised something that reflects the changes to the Bond universe since the arrival of Daniel Craig. It is, apparently, going to be gritty, tough and realistic; as Executive Producer Garrett Young explains, \"We spent a lot of time talking to the filmmakers about how they think about Bond, and how they \"rebooted\" him in Casino Royale. This new Bond formed the vision for the experience we wanted to deliver in our game: Daniel Craig is a much more physical, more cunning, and more dangerous Bond than ever before.\"</p> <p>So there will be no tank driving. There certainly won't be a proliferation of ridiculous gadgets. Instead, it's a straight-up first-person shooter\u2026<br><br>\u2026.well, a straight-up first-person shooter with third-person elements. When you get close to an enemy, the camera zooms back so you can simulteneously perform and view a 'Takedown' - one quick, rugged hand-to-hand combat move that messily debilitates your target. The concept is designed to reflect Craig's highly physicalised Bond interpretation, so expect plenty of snapped necks and pulverized faces. There are also a few cinematic action sequences, which work a little like quick-time events and again, let you watch Bond carrying out the task in hand. The free-running sequence from Casino is supposed to be one example.</p> <p>The cover system is third-person, too, apparently to give you a better tactical view of the action. Like Gears of War and Rainbow Six, which also use the third-person viewpoint (the latter is a major inspiration on the Quantum team) this is a game about careful progress and positioning, not running in like a maniac brandishing a railgun. Although, with 26 weapons to collect, running in like a maniac is probably always going to be an option. On that subject, the game seems to contain the usual collection of semi-automatics, sniper rifles and machine guns. My favourite though, is the D.A.D System \u2013 an enormous multiple grenade launcher that looks like it could take out a small town, let alone a passing super criminal.</p> <p>Anyway, the action kicks off at Mr White's mansion on Lake Como where the Casino Royale movie ends. Bond has just put a bullet into White's leg when several henchmen turn up and a shoot-out commences, spilling out across the palatial gardens and down to the boathouse. There's a good sense of place and choerography, with ornamental trees and flowerbeds, providing an unlikely backdrop to the mayhem. The enemies seem reasonably intelligent, using cover, not just to duck behind stuff when you're shooting straight at them, but also to get around the environment without you seeing them. I was also told that in later levels, they'll begin to use flanking manouveres, lobbing in the odd flash grenade if you spend too long cowering behind a wall.</p> <p>I also got a quick blast on two levels inspired by Casino Royale scenes. One is in Miami and involves sniping guards from across the road before moving in to sneak around a science facility. Another is aboard a train (a sequence cut from the film), where Bond must fight his way through several carriages, blasting enemies before climbing onto the roof and leaping on to an adjacent goods vehicle. If Treyarch was hoping to avoid any GoldenEye comparisons this was probably not the level to show to journalists: it bears more than a passing resemblance to that game's own Train mission.</p> <p>Several multiplayer maps were also playable, all of which (understandably) have a real CoD4 feel to them \u2013 there's the same brutal intensity, the same sense of constant vulnerability. The environments are similar too - 'Barge', for example, is set on a large ship highly reminiscent of CoD4's Wetwork map. Another level features a rundown apartment complex, surrounded by dusty car parks and sporting a rooftop patio that's ripe for sniping. It's got the same battered, war torn look as the urban locales built by Infinity Ward. The standout for me, though, is 'Siena', a mass of rooftops, walkways and church towers, brilliantly utilising the renaissance architecture of the Tuscan city. You want to leg it around the place, jamming in and out of nooks and crannies, but one dodgy step and you're plummeting to the narrow streets below.</p> <p>As with most games these days, physics is a key concern. \"We have destructible environments, incorporating everything from ambient effects to interactions that impact gameplay,\" says Young. \"We have large 'mousetraps' gamers can use to take out multiple enemies at once (as we learned from the filmmakers, \"Bond is almost always out-manned and out-gunned\"). We even have a sinking house at the end of the Venice level, complete with swinging beams, falling elevators and paint cans that roll with the dynamic angle of the floor.\"</p> <p>So this is the new Bond, real-world physics, real-world action. No camp comedy. No safari suits. No gadgets. And apparently the movie chaps love it. As Young says, \"They really did a tremendous job of supporting us with reference and assets - we got a very early draft of the movie script, we got to visit the set four times, and we got thousands of photos and dozens of hours of video. That synergy between movie and game really comes across in how the levels look and feel\". Craig himself is a fan \u2013 contributing ideas during the development process, especially about the Bond characterization.</p> <p>Oh actually, there is one gadget. Bond can use a smart phone to patch into security cameras and hack electronic locks. He can also steal the SIMs from enemy handsets and nick all their sensitive information. But this is just peripheral stuff. It's filler, there to appease the casual crowd. The main focus is combat. It's Call of Duty with spies. I mean, how wrong could that be?</p>",
  "<p>I want to give some love to Joe Biden, and to strongly urge undecided women to consider that a vote for him is a vote for their best interests. Like Hillary Clinton, Biden supported the Iraq war and is far more corporation-friendly than Barack Obama, which makes a lot of progressives dislike him. But in the year of the prized woman voter, Biden is a strongly pro-woman candidate. He is responsible for <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/08/25/the-strange-silence-on-biden-s-signature-accomplishment.aspx#comments\">sponsoring and championing the historic Violence Against Women's Act</a>, which was the first federal legislation that protected women against domestic violence and really brought the issue to the national agenda. </p> <p>Ironically, back in 1991, Biden's long stance as a pro-women's rights legislator made <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D71E3EF932A25753C1A967958260\">his role in Clarence Thomas's supreme court confirmation hearings</a> that much more criticised. Critics accused Biden of not taking Anita Hill's claims that Thomas sexually harassed her seriously enough. But <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=685a4524-9702-49c0-b062-7d9ecd21a854\">Biden championed a Civil Rights bill for women</a>, ensuring we are protected against hate crimes and defamation. It's these same protections Sarah Palin will welcome <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/sarahpalin/3127313/Sarah-Palin-porn-film-made-by-Larry-Flynt.html\">should her image be defamed in pornography or online</a>. </p> <p>Biden isn't a naturally touching or empathetic man, but such moments emerge despite his decades in the Senate. When debating Palin, Biden assumed the very human characteristics that some might have expected from Palin, who promised:</p> <blockquote> <p>Being a mom, one very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills? About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for healthcare? We've been there also so that connection was important.</p> </blockquote> <p>Instead the pit-bull from Wasilla's determination to stick to her talking points meant she proceeded machine-like through the debate. And when attacked by Palin for being privileged and out of touch (and male), Biden simply said:</p> <blockquote> <p>But the notion that somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to - is going to make it - I understand.</p> </blockquote> <p>To have a man in the White House who takes full responsibility as a committed single father is to hope women have an ally to make the workplace more amenable to working families, mothers and fathers.</p> <p>Finally, I must mention choice. Biden has a strong record of defending a woman's right to choose, in spite of his strong Catholic faith (which is perhaps why <a href=\"http://www.prochoicewashington.org/news/press/200808231.shtml\">he has a \"mixed\" record from Naral</a> despite his support of pro-choice supreme court justices and pro-choice legislation). However, in these economically strangling time, reproductive choice is about much more than morality. It <a href=\"http://notmygal.com/2008/10/07/your-wallet-is-pro-choice/\">directly affects the health of the American family</a>, as Nerdette writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palin's position against choice is clearly harmful to women's privacy and health. It is also anti-woman from an economic point of view, as family planning and higher earnings are linked. Dr Amalia Miller, an economist at University of Virginia, has studied the effect of wages and motherhood, and found that delaying motherhood significantly increases a woman's earnings.</p> <p>She writes: \"Motherhood delay leads to a substantial increase in earnings of 10% per year of delay, a smaller increase in wage rates of 3%, and an increase in hours worked of 5%.\"</p> <p>If a new mother leaves the job at a higher wage, she might be more likely to come back to the workforce at that higher wage. This solves part of the structural problem that keeps women's wages lower in the workforce. But the ability to delay motherhood is enabled by the right to choose - when to have a child, when to leave the workforce, when to come back and so on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Women can't afford Sarah Palin in office. And if women can't afford it, no one can.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/jan/14/pickens.religion\">I'm not very good with guns</a>. A 9mm Glock sits heavy in my hand and on my conscience. I'm just a short drive away from Virginia Tech where Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded many others in 2007. With each shot the gunfire echoes all around Cahas mountain and squawking birds pepper the clear blue sky. So when I pull the trigger, I flinch. That, says Carey Garst, my host, is why I keep missing the target.</p> <p>Carey, who has been shooting since he was a teenager, is patient. \"You've got nothing to be scared of,\" he assures me. \"You're on the right side of the gun.\" And then he loads me up with more bullets while I try to forget the lethal force in my hands and put a hole in a paper plate. Later he takes out the AR-15 rifle and I feel as though I am auditioning for yet another sequel to the Matrix. </p> <p>Carey enjoys guns for sport. Not long ago he took a course at the private security firm Blackwater to gain more expertise. He has an entire arsenal in a huge safe in the shed at the back of his house stacked up in front of a picture of Jimi Hendrix. There are pistols, small calibre rifle, rifle and shotgun combinations, something that's good for killing varmints and a fully automatic Uzi that he got a good deal on. He acquires guns like I acquire books. Not to use them but just to have them. He's actually trying to get rid of some because he barely uses them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338415732\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/08/shooting2.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge, shooting\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Garst fires off a round while Gary Younge looks on. Photograph: Sean Smith</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he also thinks they are vital for self-defence. \"If your 80-year-old grandmother is living alone and somebody breaks in, how's she going to protect herself?\" he asks. \"She can't fight him off hand to hand.\" When he describes the attributes of different weapons and shooting styles, he does so in terms of his ability to fire at persons unknown in situations indefinite. At times you wonder whom he seeks to defend himself against. Up here in the hills of Franklin County, 20 miles south of Roanoke, crime is not much of a problem and Carey does not seem like the kind of man who goes looking for trouble.</p> <p>Obama, Carey insists, wants to take his guns. Obama has insisted he doesn't. Carey doesn't believe him. Obama has voted to <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Barack_Obama_Gun_Control.htm\">ban semi-automatics </a>and for stiffer licensing laws in the past. And while Carey doesn't think he'll be able to take his guns, the fact that he may want to is reason enough to oppose him. In a state like Virginia, even that perception could hurt Obama badly, which is why the National Rifle Association has been <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/channel-08/2008/09/nra_targets_obama-biden_in_ong.html\">running ads against him recently</a>. </p> <p>That's not the main reason why Carey doesn't like Obama. There are many, foremost among them his redistributive tax policy. But his issues with the Democratic nominee go beyond the political to the philosophical. Carey, who has a well-paid job for a lumber firm in Rocky Mount, believes that government intrudes in the natural order of things. People should protect themselves, support themselves and take care of themselves. </p> <p>Well-read and well-travelled Carey doesn't suit the liberal stereotype of a gun nut, let alone a redneck. His adherence to rugged individualism suits him quite well because he is quite a rugged individual. He built his own barn, clears his own land (he owns a few acres) and is in the process of making a lake. He works hard and seems proud of the fact that he only takes one week vacation a year. </p> <p>He describes himself as conservative, not Republican. He is deeply disappointed in George Bush's last term, citing his failure to secure the border from illegal immigrants and his failed nomination of Harriet Miers as two particular low points. He's backing McCain as the lesser of two evils but Democrat, Mark Warner, for Senate because he did such a good job as governor.</p> <p>As the sun went down, we took a short tour of his land and then headed home for dinner with his wife, who is also named Carey, and is deeply religious and more conservative than he is, according to her husband. Mrs Garst listens to the public radio station NPR on her way to work in the morning and conservative talk radio on her way back. She likes Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. But neither of them spend much time on the internet scooping up rumours only to regurgitate them as fact.</p> <p>Over wine, we talked health care and taxes and they both despaired at the prospect of an Obama administration. Given that he's such a disaster, I asked why they thought he was doing so well in Virginia. After a moment of reflection Mrs Garst said she had no idea.</p> <p>\"Why do they support him?\" she asked. \"What do they say?\" I mentioned economy, Iraq and health care as the main three things that keep coming up. She had informed responses as to why Obama would be bad on all of them. But her question itself was telling. </p> <p>An evening with the Garsts lays bare the depths of America's political polarisation. A night out with many liberals could well produce the same confusion about what motivates the other side. The problem is not just that people do not agree with each other. It is that at times they don't even seem to know each other politically beyond caricature. A sizeable section of both the Democratic and Republican base believes that the only reason the other exists is because they are either deluded, bigoted, misinformed, misanthropic, greedy, gullible or godless. Both believe that their information pool is contaminated - one by the liberal media, the other by the mainstream corporate media. The issue is not that there's no middle ground, it's that there's little in the way of common ground.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty years after his first poetry collection Birthmarks was published to critical acclaim, Mick Imlah has won the \u00a310,000 Forward prize for best collection with his second, The Lost Leader.</p> <p>Imlah, who promised to \"take care to be quicker\" with his next collection, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the end of last year and pronounced himself \"thrilled\" at his win. \"It's a great boost for morale in my present circumstances,\" he added, saying that he planned to spend his \u00a310,000 winnings on his two daughters, Iona (five) and Mary (two).</p> <p>Last night's Forward awards ceremony also saw 35-year-old Kathryn Simmons take the \u00a35,000 best first collection prize for Sunday at the Skin Launderette. The \u00a31,000 best individual poem prize went to Don Paterson's poem about his unrequited love for an obscure Eastern European singer, beating Seamus Heaney's Cutaways.</p> <p>Paterson's \"Love Poem For Natalie 'Tusja' Beridze\", in which he writes of his love for the real-life singer \"with her unruly Slavid eyebrows ranged like/ two duelling pistols\", was described by chair of judges Frieda Hughes as \"fabulously wrought lines of devotion from a benevolent stalker who should be given free concert tickets for life\". </p> <p>Fellow judge and poet Fleur Adcock said: \"It was quite tricky to judge because we had Seamus Heaney there - a great monument glowering at you. Seamus always writes brilliantly but Don Paterson's poem was just so original, so startling; it's not the sort of thing some of us would have thought of reading. Not everyone's into looking up obscure singers on the internet. [But] it's one of those poems of such ingenuity, so entertaining - he keeps you waiting for the rhymes in the style of Ogden Nash.\" Heaney, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1995, has yet to win anything in the Forward prize's 17-year history.</p> <p>The judging process for the best collection was a much easier one, said Hughes, a poet, author and painter herself. \"I had imagined, when the judges re-convened, that there would be some heavy debate about the possible winner of this category. But it was unanimous: Mick Imlah's collection, The Lost Leader, 20 years in the coming, is worth the wait.\"</p> <p>Imlah, 52, picked subjects from sport and whisky to classical mythology and historical figures (including a poem about Gordon Brown, the rugby player) for The Lost Leader, with their defining thread being Scotland. His collection was selected over Sujata Bhatt's Pure Lizard and former winner Jamie McKendrick's Crocodiles and Obelisks as well as three up-and-coming writers. Hughes and Adcock were joined on the judging panel by poet and novelist Alan Brownjohn, poet Lemn Sissay and the Financial Times poetry editor Natalie Whittle.</p> <p>Adcock said the 20-year wait since Imlah's first collection meant that \"so much richness had been building up all that time\". Hughes added: \"If the words of a poem are like the bricks of a building, then Mick has created a variety of structures with such verbal skill and dexterity that we are left with an astonishing city in which live the characters that he describes with humour, wit and an unerring eye. Modern and historical references are combined with fierce intelligence and a masterful control of syntax. No word is wasted, nothing is unintentional. Quite brilliant.\"</p> <p>Simmons, 35, winner of the first collection award, was praised for her \"vivid language and urban pathos\" by judges. Sunday at the Skin Laundrette, also longlisted for the Guardian First Book Award, sees her protagonists dealing with everyday tasks and chancing upon the surreal. \"From the boys in the fish shop to the customers who shed their skins at the Skin Launderette, we are made to feel the normality of the extraordinary and the wonder of the ordinary, because each object or artefact is given life and meaning,\" said Hughes. \"Each individual as a subject is understood, empathised with, and introduced to us in a manner that commands our attention because we cannot help but engage with them.\"</p> <p>Former winners of the Forward prize - one of the UK's most valuable poetry awards - include Sean O'Brien, Robin Robertson, Jo Shapcott, Carol Ann Duffy and Ted Hughes. William Sieghart, who founded the Forward prizes in 1992, said that this year's winning collections were characterised by their inclusion of witty and amusing poems responding to contemporary life, \"proving the versatility of the medium as well as the state of rude good health it's in\".</p> <p>The winners in full:<br>Forward prize for Best Collection: Mick Imlah for The Lost Leader<br>Felix Dennis prize for Best First Collection: Kathryn Simmons for Sunday at the Skin Launderette<br>Forward prize for Best Single Poem in memory of Michael Donaghy: Don Paterson for \"Love Poem for Natalie 'Tusja' Beridze\"</p>",
  "<p>Our economy is plummeting into the unknown. We go about our daily business as yet untouched by the disasters on the financial front. This is the phoney crash. We don't know how far we are going to fall, nor what kind of pain we'll feel when we hit the bottom. Doubt and uncertainty grip us. So who now owns the progressive future? Both the New Labour government and the new Conservatives are products of the neoliberal era that is disintegrating around us. Its rulebook has been torn up; and with that, the status quo has vanished.</p> <p>Across Europe, third way-style social democracy is in crisis. In response, the government resurrects <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/mandelson.gordonbrown\">Peter Mandelson</a> and the memory of its halcyon days. The old glory of New Labour will bring life to a zombie government. At their Birmingham conference, the Conservatives struggled to gain a foothold on solid ground. They found it in the memory of Margaret Thatcher. They, too, cannot escape the discredited orthodoxies of the past. In Birmingham David Cameron sounded like he'd given up trying. \"<a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2008/10/ David_Cameron_Conference_Speech_2008.aspx\">I'm a man with a plan</a>\", he asserted. In truth, he has no plan. Until the New Conservatives give up their dogmatic belief in liberal market capitalism they're irrelevant to the crisis at hand.</p> <p>Alistair Darling has been resolutely irresolute. His tantalising promise of action which specified nothing sent a paranoid market into flight. Now at last the government has been forced to ditch its blind faith in markets. Its massive and unprecedented intervention will attempt to prop up the banks and stop the collapse of the wholesale <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10/a_very_big_rescue.html\">money markets</a>.</p> <p>Will it work? The banks must put up their hands: \"Please sir, I need some money\" \u2013 so confirming their weakness to the market. Will the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/\">market react</a> like a herd of wildebeest and stampede? Suddenly the truth of the system dawns. Like water, capital is almost impossible to control when in flood. This is a liquid economy. As one government attempts to shore up its collapsing banks, capital pours out across its national boundaries. The markets are amoral, and they are mindless. They need regulating \u2013 otherwise they pursue successful profit-seeking to destruction. They have no place in the governance and civic and social affairs of society.</p> <p>And yet markets have come to rule our lives and now threaten to destroy us. The so-called invisible hand is a charade that allows those who have to gain more. A tiny unaccountable elite has manipulated economic activity in order to enrich itself. The profound absence in this crisis is our collective sense of democratic agency. Today's unprecedented measures have been forced upon a reluctant, timid government. And yet they have to be the first step in the fundamental structural reform of liberal market capitalism. Democracy must assert itself over capitalism. Where is the politics capable of seizing this moment?</p> <p>The markets cannot be allowed to manage people's long-term social security or pension schemes. The principle of social insurance has to be reasserted. Markets cannot be allowed to deliver welfare reform, nor are they suitable for allocating the resources of care and health provision. The market has created a crisis in housing provision. Privatisation and proxy markets have undermined the ethos of public service and led to dysfunctional, demoralised organisations. The culture of capitalism has invaded every aspect of British society. Its logic of profit-seeking, its nihilism and instrumental drive toward efficiency and cost-reduction destroys creativity, and is profoundly at odds with the promotion of human wellbeing.</p> <p>The credit culture that has driven our consumer society and turned our homes into commodities has been a modern form of exploitation. Systemic irresponsible lending has expropriated people's often meagre wages to create continuous revenues of debt repayments that have redistributed wealth to the rich via the financial markets. The credit culture has created an illusion of plenitude and affluence which disguises the millions who are paying back debt like a form of indentured labour.</p> <p>There are more storms brewing on the horizon \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/globaleconomy.oil\">global warming</a>, <a href=\"http://www.peakoil.net/\">peak oil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org\">water scarcity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">food insecurity</a> are rolling towards us. These are momentous, frightening times. The fundamentals of our economy, the sustainability of human life are under threat. This is no time for timid, piecemeal politics.

  "<p>Ahead of the World Bank annual meeting in Washington this weekend, an alliance of US environmental campaigners today stepped up their criticism of the Bank's proposed funds to combat climate change.</p> <p>The Bank's climate investment funds were unveiled in July, when 10 industrialised nations pledged $6.1bn (\u00a33.5bn) in aid to developing nations to fight the threat of rising global temperatures. </p> <p>But environmental groups as well as some representatives from developing nations have condemned the Bank for attempting to set climate policy while continuing to fund large fossil fuel-burning projects such as the planned Tata Mundra coal plant in India. </p> <p>The same concerns about the Bank's involvement with coal projects have prompted the US Congress to delay approval for an American contribution to the climate funds.</p> <p>\"The Bank is proposing that the solution to this problem of climate change is advocating cheap energy in the form of coal, that coal is integral in overcoming poverty,\" Janet Redman, a research director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning US think tank, told reporters today.</p> <p>Redman called the climate funds \"a classic move of the World Bank, which is to announce something that doesn't have the critical buy-in it needs to move forward\".<br> Republican senator Pete Domenici and other coal supporters in the US have cheered the proposed climate funds, although Congress is unlikely to authorise an American share until next year. </p> <p>Developing nations in the so-called Group of 77 also have pushed back against the Bank's climate funds, contending that the UN should take the lead on climate policy in preparation for next year's Copenhagen talks on a global emissions treaty. <br> \"We are very concerned by the Bank's attempt to control global financing policy on climate,\" Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US, said. \"The World Bank is a major climate polluter, a major deforester.\"</p> <p>The global financial meltdown - which prompted a US government rescue plan more than 100 times the size of the proposed climate funds - is likely to dominate the Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting, pushing climate change further down the agenda.</p> <p>Uncertainty about evaporating worldwide credit could ultimately help by dissuading the Bank from pursuing a solely market-based climate policy, according to Bernarditas Muller, lead coordinator for the Group of 77 and China during last year's UN climate talks in Bali.</p> <p>\"We've been told that the market will solve the problem,\" Muller said. \"What's happening right now shows very clearly that markets will not necessarily, or even not at all, solve the problem.\"</p> <p>Another controversial aspect of the proposed climate funds is the possibility that wealthier nations will offer aid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/16/climatechange.internationalaidanddevelopment\" ?>in the form of loans</a>, requiring developing countries to pay back the money with interest.</p> <p>Redman, of the Institute for Policy Studies, said the loan-based structuring risks \"undermining climate justice\". She pointed to a sunset clause in the proposed funds that allow the Bank to step aside if the UN reaches a deal on a new global climate treaty next year. </p> <p>The UK government has defended the funds as innovative. Phil Woolas, the environment minister, and Gareth Thomas, the trade and development minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/19/carbonemissions.climatechange\">wrote to the Guardian</a> in May that the proposal would \"influence [the Bank's] lending to move in the right directions\".</p>",
  "<p>The recent spate of piracy off <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7651329.stm\">Somalia's coast</a> is yet another symptom of the country's collapse of stability and some of its peoples' intense desperation. Reports that the pirates or hijackers of the Ukrainian vessel had begun shooting each other formed a perfect microcosm of Somalia's brutal inner turmoil.<br> But in the northern half of the country, known as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/country_profiles/3794847.stm\">Somaliland</a>, there is no such mayhem. Given its close proximity to the ravaged \"failed state\" of Somalia, it is astonishing that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/mar/09/somaliland\">Somaliland</a> should be stable, safe, democratic and largely crime-free.<br> To most people, Somalia is synonymous with bloody anarchy \u2013 simply one of the most dangerous places in the world. Only the few people with an active interest in the Horn of Africa seem aware of Somaliland's peaceful existence. The leading authority on the region since the 1950s is Professor Ioan Lewis \u2013 his book, <a href=\"http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-70084-9/understanding-somalia-and-somaliland\">Understanding Somalia and Somaliland</a>, published in July, leads you to the conclusion. In comprehending the unending enigma of the Horn, one course of action is clear \u2013 the peaceful north must be allowed to declare independence from the endless chaos of the south.<br> That view is privately shared by many governments in Africa and in the wider world, but Somaliland's declared independence of 1991 is still yet to formally recognised by any nation and it remains an \"invisible\" country. Diplomatic recognition is the perpetual obsession of the Somaliland government; without it, the country remains starved of foreign investment and aid. In all probability, it would take just one country, such the US, to move on the issue and the rest, with a handful of exceptions, would be bound to follow. However, none of the main players wants to be first, so they are engaged in a multiple \"Mexican stand-off\".  The few countries who openly oppose recognition (Egypt and Italy) argue \"former colonial boundaries should not be redrawn\". But Somalilanders agree. The country was a former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate\"> British protectorate </a> which became independent in 1960 and simultaneously joined in union with the former Italian colony of Somalia. By the mid-1980s the union was rapidly disintegrating; the mass bombing in 1988 of Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa, where 50,000 civilians were killed extinguished any thoughts of reconciliation.<br> The collective policy of finding a peaceful solution in the southern half of Somalia has not progressed even after 15 peace conferences in as many years. One Somali commentator called this apparently pointless exercise, \"the policy of following a blind camel\". A <a href=\"http://www.senliscouncil.net/\">Senlis council</a> report published in April says, \"the international community needs to be reawakened from its torpor on Somaliland\".<br> But Ted Dagne from Washington's congressional research service argues: \"Somalia must develop a federal structure that gives regional autonomy.\" For the Somalilanders in the north this political theorem is plainly non-sensical. They see the failed union like two brothers who went into business together \u2013 while one brother was sober and hard-working, the other went off the rails, destroying the company's stock along with its reputation. Yet it is to the \"reckless brother\" the international community relentlessly turns to for a solution.  The Somaliland president Dahir Riyale Kahin visited the US in April in the hope of broadening support towards the goal of recognition. Somaliland has certainly passed any democratic test set by Washington in establishing a multi-party system, holding free and fair elections and upholding freedom of speech.  There is now a division of opinion at the top of the US government on this issue. Pentagon chief Robert Gates sees Somaliland as \"an entity that works\". But Dr Jendayi Frazer, second in command at the state department said: \"The US will not take the first step to recognising Somaliland before the African Union.\" A change of president in January may alter that position, or before that Bush may be persuaded that Somaliland recognition could be part of his \"African legacy\". The military see the strategic importance of having a base in the Gulf of Aden as a bulwark against al-Qaida and the deep-water port of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbera\">Berbera</a> could be ideal. <br> Ultimately, these are the factors which are likely to determine Somaliland's chances of gaining equal nation status under the UN and not its efforts, against the odds, to create a democratic and free society.</p>",
  "<p>In the single biggest spend by any chancellor of the exchequer ever, Alistair Darling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">has committed up to \u00a3500bn</a> to saving the UK's banks from a crisis of their own making. This level of commitment is essential \u2013 yet Alistair Darling's plan is fundamentally flawed.<br> Listening to Darling speak, it would be easy to think the investment he is making is in a modest portfolio of shares for his personal pension fund from which he hopes to make a little dividend income and a long-term capital gain. It isn't. It's enough to have purchased Lloyds TSBH, RBS, Barclays and HBOS outright last night.  That means the investment is enough to let him demand a paradigm shift in the way in which British financial services are managed forever. It's a shift most commentators realise is needed. Anglo-Saxon capitalism has failed. Our \"light touch\" regulation has been a disaster. The directors of our banks have been reckless. The shareholders \u2013 in effect, our pension funds \u2013 have lost enormously, and so, now, will all taxpayers. The investment in equity alone is almost half of NHS annual spending. There will be no government spending programme, whether it be health, education, law and order or the environment that will not be adversely affected by this commitment of funds for years to come.  Despite that, Alistair Darling is asking for almost nothing in exchange, just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/gordonbrown.economy\">some modest pay caps</a> and restraint on dividends: dividends the banks will not be able to pay in any case, since they are, for all practical purposes, bust right now.<br> As a result, Darling is missing the chance to take control of our banks: to demand they repatriate profits to the UK from those locations where they have hidden them offshore and out of his clutches in years gone by. He is not sacking those most responsible for creating the mess when he should. He is not forcing the banks to close down their massive speculative activities and to turn instead to investing in the real capacity of the UK to make a living for itself. He's not requiring that immediate action be taken to protect investors or mortgage holders who are in trouble: the people who will be paying for this bail-out. He's not asking the banks to float off their profitable activities to pay back his cash at the first possible opportunity as any commercial investor would. He's not putting his people in charge to ensure that these banks comply with the requirements of regulation, disclosure and accountability henceforth. Unbelievably, he's simply gifting more taxpayers' money than has ever been spent in a single day to those who have proven their unlimited capacity to lose it. </p> <p>This will be a disaster for us all \u2013 and all because he and the Treasury are still frightened of bankers. It's a fear they need to be put behind them. These people are fallible. So is the system they have promoted. It's time Darling placed his faith in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">the awkward squad</a>: those who have stood outside the system and criticised it, even when all around said it was delivering wealth. It is they who saw through the illusion. It is they who should now be sitting on the boards of these banks. </p> <p>Now, it is the job of the House of Commons to make him change his mind about this. The House of Representatives <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy2\">demanded that Paulson be held to account</a>. Can our MPs do the same for Darling? It is their democratic duty to do so.</p>",
  "<p>Nature has thwarted the Vatican's ghoulish, heartless plot to <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/articles/a0000350.shtml\">disinter, dismember and display</a> the remains of the 19th century English theologian, Cardinal Newman. When a posse of papal grandees dug up his grave near Birmingham, they <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4898875.ece\">found it empty</a>. The Vatican grave robbers had apparently been foiled by bacteria and worms. </p> <p>Newman's body had decomposed to nothing, leaving a vacant grave and frustrating plans by the Catholic church to break up his body and hawk his bones as holy relics.</p> <p>The only personal artefact found in the graveyard earth was a tiny piece of <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.net/news/2008/10/06/cardinal-newman-s-body-missing-as-catholic-church-opens-grave-65233-21974937/\">tassel</a> from the cardinal's cap. Its survival from the ravages of decomposition will no doubt, in due course, be hailed by the Vatican as The Miracle of the Red Tassel and be cited as a divine intervention that proves Newman's holiness and his worthiness of veneration. Sigh. </p> <p>Newman died in 1890 and is now being fast-tracked to sainthood. Pope Benedict XVI wanted his remains reburied in a grand marble tomb in Birmingham Oratory Church, where he could be worshipped and the church could raise vast sums of money from pilgrims by selling \"Holy Newman\" souvenirs.</p> <p>The Vatican's reburial scheme would have <a href=\"http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/cardinalnewmanslove.htm\">violated</a> the Cardinal's repeated, explicit instructions to his executors, which were that he should be buried with the man he loved, and with whom he lived for more than 30 years, Father Ambrose St John.</p> <p>As well as making money out of Newman's sainthood, the Pope wanted to rebury Newman separate from St John to scotch <a href=\"http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/wascardinalnewmangay.htm\">allegations</a> concerning his homosexuality. The Catholic Church has always been deeply embarrassed that the two men were buried together in the same grave and that they <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6qq5nb\">wrote about each other</a> in passionate romantic language. Such evidence has prompted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/catholicism.gayrights\">credible suggestions</a> that the Cardinal might have been gay, at least by orientation if not by sexual practice. </p> <p>Foiling the Vatican's knavish plans, Newman's and St John's bodies have decomposed together, uniting them forever in the same soil. They cannot now be separated, as the Pope wanted. Cardinal Newman's wishes have triumphed over the homophobia of the Catholic hierarchy. </p> <p>The revelation of the empty grave came after I had written to the justice secretary, Jack Straw, arguing that it was morally wrong and possibly unlawful for the Ministry of Justice to grant the Catholic church an exhumation and reburial licence that violates Newman's instructions to his executors. </p> <p>This licence was granted, in utmost secrecy, in July, after much moral arm-twisting by Vatican emissaries, including lobbying recent Catholic convert Tony Blair.</p> <p>The government's willingness to give a non-relative third party the right to veto the Cardinal's will and to control his remains strikes me as high-handed and disrespectful. In effect, the Ministry of Justice caved in to Vatican demands and gave the Catholic church disposal rights over Newman's body, including authority to remove his bones and parade them in public as holy relics. The government's collusion with these macabre plans is shameful. </p> <p>My letter to Mr Straw asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>Could you please explain the Ministry of Justice's justification for making a decision that goes against Cardinal Newman's clear, unambiguous and emphatic instructions to his executors that he should be buried with Father Ambrose St John. </p> </blockquote> <p>It concluded:</p> <blockquote> <p>I would respectfully request that in light of the overwhelming evidence that Cardinal Newman wished to be buried with Ambrose St John that you either revoke the licence in its entirety or amend it to stipulate that the Cardinal's remains can only be exhumed and reburied on condition that Ambrose St John is also moved and reburied with him.</p> <p>I urge you to ensure that Cardinal Newman's wishes are adhered to and respected.</p> </blockquote> <p>I received a reply last week. It was penned on Mr Straw's behalf by his junior justice minister, Catholic MP Bridget Prentice. As the person in charge of the Ministry of Justice burials department, she wrote to me justifying her decision to grant a special exhumation and reburial licence to the Catholic church:</p> <blockquote> <p>I was aware of Cardinal Newman's own recorded views regarding his place of burial. I took these views into consideration when deciding to grant the licence but did not consider them to be the overriding consideration in this case.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wonder whether it is entirely right and proper that this exceptional and controversial decision should have been made by a Catholic minister? Won't it inevitably lead to allegations that the minister has, as a loyal Catholic, shown favouritism towards the Vatican's pleadings?</p> <p>Well, all those issues are academic now. The cardinal's body has turned to dust in the place where he wanted to be buried, beside the man he loved. There will be no reburial. Pope Benedict has lost his battle to overturn Newman's wishes. Sweet justice.</p> <p><em>This article originally referred to Pope Benedict XI instead of Benedict XVI. It was amended at 9.20 on October 9 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>With domestic and global attention turned to the financial crisis and the last four weeks of the race for the White House, the Bush administration is taking the opportunity to quietly check off some nefarious boxes in its efforts to spread the American culture wars beyond our shores. <br> Last week, the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/\">Marie Stopes International</a>, which fairly calls itself \"one of the world's leading family planning institutions\", received a letter leaders of the organisation had been both dreading and expecting since June. Penned by Kent Hill, assistant administrator at <a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/\">USAID's bureau for global health</a>, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/04/usa.internationalaidanddevelopment\">dropped an anvil</a>.</p> <p>\"In light of the restrictions on USAID assistance and MSI's work as the major implementing partner of [the UN Population Fund]'s programme in China, which supports China's family planning programme, USAID has concluded that it is not appropriate for MSI to receive USAID funded contraceptives and/or condoms from host country governments,\" Hill wrote, even though MSI doesn't itself receive any USAID funding itself.</p> <p>The reason? The Kemp-Kasten Amendment, a lesser-known restriction on global population control organisations that purports to thwart groups that engage in coercive abortion or forced sterilisation. Sounds like a no-brainer - after all, who supports coercive abortion? But the application of Kemp-Kasten, which was enacted in 1985, has been wielded by Republican administrations since Ronald Reagan as a legislative sledgehammer that fits hand-in-glove with the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/usa.sexeducation\">global gag rule</a> that restricts any family planning organisation that even mentions abortion. Since 2002, the Bush administration has <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/12128.htm\">cited Kemp-Kasten</a> in its annual decision to <a href=\"http://www.undispatch.com/archives/2008/06/no_us_funding_f.php\">withhold our $39.7m in yearly dues from the UN Population Fund (UNFPA)</a>.<br> The impact? In his letter USAID's Hill went on to say that countries working with MSI had been instructed, effective immediately, to no longer work with MSI. At least six African countries will lose MSI's distribution of crucial USAID-supplied contraceptives and condoms in rural and remote areas and urban slums. The nations affected include Ghana, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, countries for whom MSI currently covers some 25% of contraceptive distribution.</p> <p>For the Bush administration, which touts its HIV/Aids strategy in Africa as one of its major success stories, cracking down on condom distribution in Africa seems a far cry from implementing comprehensive disease-control efforts. Not to mention the fact that American politicians in general \u2013 even Sarah Palin \u2013 claim that reducing the number of abortions is a worthy and admirable goal. And yet by undermining the effort to distribute the means to prevent pregnancy and disease, USAID has slashed both such efforts.</p> <p>In a statement, <a href=\"http://www.planetwire.org/details/7829\">MSI outlined the potential consequences</a> of such a move:</p> <blockquote> <p>MSI's family planning services prevented 5-7 million unwanted pregnancies in 2007 alone, thus preventing 1-1.5 million abortions. Most of these abortions would have been unsafe, putting women's lives at risk. \"For every two intra-uterine devices (IUDs) the US government denies MSI, an unsafe abortion could result unless MSI is able to find alternative supplies,\" MSI president Dana Hovig explained.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's no secret that China's family planning programme is deemed coercive. Fears of forced sterilisations have existed for years. But MSI and UNFPA have long argued that their work in no way supports forced sterilisation or coerced abortions \u2013 a point verified by independent observers. Instead they give women safe means for controlling their own bodies.</p> <p>Craig Larsen, a senior policy analyst at <a href=\"http://www.populationaction.org/\">Population Action International</a>, explained to me that organisations like Marie Stopes had feared a crackdown as far back as June. A few sentences issued by USAID indicated the organisation was beginning to look into expanding the reach of the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, though no one knew exactly where USAID was taking that veiled threat. <br> The hypocrisy of the Bush administration knows no bounds. This is a policy that will not have an impact on China at all. Indeed, for impact on China, perhaps President Bush might have considered not attending the Beijing Olympics and lustily partaking in the celebration of Chinese culture. In a letter to Condoleezza Rice protesting the recent restraints placed on MSI, Nita Lowey, a New York congresswoman, pointed out that the US government itself, in a 2001 assessment of the UNFPA, also rejected the case for UN programmes supporting any kind of unsavoury Chinese policies.  As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/usa.sexeducation\">wrote</a> back in July, the World Bank estimates that 51 million unintended pregnancies take place globally every year, 68,000 women die from botched or unsafe abortions each year and 5.1 million are left permanently disabled by them. The World Bank drew a direct link between giving women access to contraception and family planning and boosting economic growth and ending endemic poverty and maternal and infant death.</p> <p>But the Bush administration is more interested in expanding our ugly culture wars than helping women internationally. With this move, USAID has put in place a stumbling block even for an incoming Obama administration. Whereas the global gag rule has become a must-undo for Democrats upon entering office (Bill Clinton repealed the original gag rule the moment he walked into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1993, and Obama would likely do the same) and likewise reinstated by Republicans (Bush II immediately signed the gag rule back into effect in 2001), Kemp-Kasten must be reviewed by state department lawyers and legislators to be reassessed.</p> <p>All of which means that, though Obama would surely put in motion the wheels to roll back such obvious political measures, it will take months, not days, even with a Democratic administration, to reinstate Marie Stopes's efforts to distribute IUDs and condoms in Africa. That means months of no distribution, months of women used as pawns in a Republican game that ruins or ends lives halfway around the world as a means of placating their supporters here at home.</p>",
  "<p>Again, too little, too late. While the finance sector and the world's debtors must have noticed that central banks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.banking\">co-ordinated a 0.5% cut in interest rates</a>, be sure they cared little. The fact is, this cut makes virtually no difference to their very high borrowing costs or to the threat that bankruptcy poses. </p> <p>Imagine the impact of such a cut on a small businesswoman with staffing and other overheads, with customers shutting their purses and walking away, and with an overdraft of \u00a350,000. She may now pay 14.5% instead of 15% interest on that debt. Or imagine the impact on a company with outstanding loans of \u00a35m or a financial institution with liabilities of \u00a35bn. </p> <p>It is far too little, far too late. Furthermore, this cut will not necessarily affect the Libor (London interbank offered rate), which has been ratcheting upwards and which, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a0JbUyhTA71Y&amp;refer=home\">according to Bloomberg</a>, is applied to trillions of dollars of debt, including the mortgages of a million American homeowners.</p> <p>Central bankers and finance ministers gave away control over that crucial rate to the private sector, as part of the dogma of deregulation. They are thus bereft of a crucial lever needed to contain this financial firestorm. </p> <p>But while central bankers still maintain control over the official policy or base rate, they have failed to use it to deal with this crisis. Why? Because they cannot see past the neoliberal argument that inflation is the gravest threat of all, and that to contain inflation, rates have to stay high.</p> <p>Furthermore, they have been given a political mandate \u2013 from Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling and endorsed by George Osborne \u2013 to regard inflation as a graver threat than say, prolonged and systemic global economic failure. For let us not forget the Bank of England is not an independent central bank. It remains in public ownership. Its governor, Mervyn King, is a public servant, and the monetary policy committee has a very clear political remit to treat inflation as the number one threat. </p> <p>The Treasury, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have relished playing this role: the hard men of high interest rates. It was these high real rates of interest that precipitated the \"debtonation\" in August 2007. </p> <p>On October 2 this year, you and I, reading our newspapers, knew that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial meltdown</a> was in the offing. That a very big bank, Hypo Real Estate Holding, Germany's second-largest property lender, was collapsing. On that day the governor of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/europeanbanks.banking\">announced solemnly</a> that rates for the whole of the eurozone would not budge.</p> <p>Back in the summer, Trichet seemed to welcome the political unease of European politicians who questioned his decision to keep rates high. \"Bring 'em on,\" he seemed to be saying. \"The more democratic challenges there are to my authority, the more of a hard man that proves me to be; the greater price stability, the sounder our financial system.\" If it were not so tragic, one would have to laugh. </p> <p>Central bankers and finance ministers must dismiss the charlatans of economic orthodoxy and face the most blatantly obvious fact about this global financial meltdown: that it is borrowing costs, not liquidity shortages, that are bankrupting banks, companies, households and individuals. Slashing those costs urgently will do more, and cost taxpayers a lot less, than billions of pounds spent recapitalising banks.</p>",
  "<p>You might think that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers'</a> boss, Dick Fuld, would be chastened by presiding over the bankruptcy of one of Wall Street's most distinguished banks. He isn't. </p> <p>Wearing an unapologetic scowl, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2008/oct/07/richard.fuld.congress.lehman\">Fuld spent three hours explaining to Congress this week</a> why it wasn't his fault that a 158-year-old institution evaporated under his watch. In scattergun fashion, he blamed the Federal Reserve, naked short-sellers, a \"systemic\" lack of confidence, media sensationalising and inconsistent regulation.</p> <p>\"Not that anyone on this committee cares about this but I wake up every single night wondering what I could have done differently,\" barked Fuld at one point. He usually manages to go back to sleep, though, because he thinks all his decisions were \"prudent and appropriate\" given the information he had at the time.</p> <p>A day later, the House oversight committee heard a similar refrain from the two men who ran the world's biggest insurance company, AIG, in the months before it had to beg the US government for an $85bn (\u00a350bn) loan to stay in business.</p> <p>Using tortured logic, AIG's erstwhile chief executive, Robert Willumstad, and his British-born predecessor, Martin Sullivan, tried to offload responsibility by blaming the rules of accounting for the firm's near collapse.</p> <p>The principle of mark-to-market accounting, complained Willumstad, forced AIG to write off billions of dollars of unrealised losses on obscure investments in swaps and derivatives because the things were rendered unsale-able when the credit markets froze.</p> <p>\"Looking back on my time as CEO, I don't believe AIG could have done anything differently,\" Willumstad said. \"The market seizure was an unprecedented global catastrophe.\"</p> <p>This shrugging of expensively tailored shoulders is pretty unsavoury stuff. It begs a simple question \u2013 where does the buck stop in business if a chief executive can keep a straight face while disclaiming all responsibility for the collapse of a major corporation?</p> <p>The absurd sums earned by Wall Street figures are well trodden ground \u2013 Fuld agreed to the committee that he had pocketed somewhere between $250m and $350m over the last eight years - and in terms of public esteem, corporate bosses are held somewhere close to arsonists. <br><a href=\"http://community.marketwatch.com/groups/us-politics/topics/ceo---chief-embezzlement-officer\">One email circulating this week</a> offered a spoof glossary of terms for the global financial crisis. It suggested that CEO stands for \"chief embezzlement officer\" while CFO means \"corporate fraud officer\".</p> <p>None of the men before Congress this week spent much time addressing the fundamental fault which led to the present debacle \u2013 an excess of reckless financial risk-taking by banks and financial firms in search of short-term gains. </p> <p>Lehman was one of Wall Street's biggest and earliest enthusiasts for sub-prime mortgages, dabbling as far back as the late 1990s. It paid insufficient attention to the underlying values of the properties backing these loans \u2013 a straightforward failure of judgement and of management. In its earnings for the three months to August, which proved to be the bank's final straw, Lehman lost $3.9bn after taking a $5.3bn hit on the value of its portfolio of residential mortgages. Whose fault was that?</p> <p>Similarly, AIG delved into insurance policies intended to protect clients against the risk of default on mortgage-related derivatives. Senior bosses allowed a London-based unit specialising in these policies to run out of control. Since the credit markets seized up, AIG has had to write off an eye-watering $25.9bn on its exposure to bad debts, according to evidence put before Congress.</p> <p>The chorus from the boardrooms of financial institutions is that these types of write-downs do not represent real losses but merely an unintended consequence of a book-keeping rule, FAS 157, which requires investments to be stated at a snapshot of their present sale-able value.</p> <p>\"When there is no market, the value of securities based on FAS 157 becomes somewhat difficult and requires a certain amount of judgement,\" said Willumstad, who ran AIG for just three months in the run-up to its bail-out. \"It obviously resulted in substantial write-downs which were, obviously, not helpful to the company.\"</p> <p>For mere mortals, this is a baffling argument. Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, sounded as if she couldn't quite believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"You were just gambling billions, possibly trillions of dollars,\" she said. \"You blame accountants for coming forward, looking at the accounts and saying something has no value because nobody in the entire world wants to buy it.\"</p> <p>A former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lynn Turner, echoed this critique, telling the committee that AIG's attempt to blame accounting rules was \"like blaming the thermometer for a fever\".</p> <p>There was much mealy-mouthed waffle from dethroned executives about how pained they are at recent events. Fuld, who is nicknamed \"the gorilla\", said he felt \"horrible\". Sullivan declared himself \"heartbroken\". Willumstad didn't articulate his feelings, although he at least felt obliged to turn down a $22m golden parachute for three months' work.</p> <p>Perhaps a bit of further reflection would help. Instead of a payoff, how about an alternative farewell to departing executives? They should all be sent on a yogic retreat, perhaps to an ashram somewhere in India, to meditate and contemplate on how it all went wrong. Maybe when they get back, they'll be ready to say sorry.</p>",
  "<p>We should be in no doubt: Vladimir Putin is a real man. Last year, he <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/22/europe/EU-GEN-Russia-Putins-Image.php\">gave us a glimpse</a> of his rippling torso while on a fishing trip in Siberia; in August, he heroically saved a Russian film crew by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7591456.stm\">downing a tiger</a> with a tranquilliser dart; and yesterday he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/russia1\">released a judo DVD</a> to celebrate his birthday.</p> <p>It's not often we get a look at Putin's private life and interests. His children are kept from the media's gaze and a newspaper report that he was about to marry a young gymnast received a <a href=\"http://news.ino.com/headlines/?newsid=68908850001\">strong response</a> from the authorities. But the snapshots we do get of Putin serve to emphasise his strong, decisive character.</p> <p>The image of a musclebound judo black belt plays up to his political image as a no-nonsense doer, a man of actions not words. During the war in South Ossetia, he dashed from Beijing to the frontlines, while Dmitry Medvedev cast a detached, sometimes dithering figure in a suit in Moscow.</p> <p>Putin's action-man image is in contrast to the old, ill and drunken figure that Boris Yeltsin often cut. It adds visual substance to the narrative of Russia lifting itself from its knees to become a strong country again after the apparent failure of the democratic project in the 1990s. His strength in standing up against the oligarchs and the west is particularly important to Russians.</p> <p>His closely controlled image has developed the kind of quasi-religious aura about him that has a long history among Russian leaders. The tsar was known as \"little father\", God's representative on earth; personality cults formed around Lenin and Stalin as strong, decisive and successful leaders. </p> <p>Like these other leaders, Putin's cult is based on the idea that he is a man of the people, in the sense that he carries out what they want by making Russia strong, but that he somehow is untouchable. While Putin speaks the language of the streets \u2013 he once told reporters that \"we will wipe [Chechen terrorists] out in the outhouse\" \u2013 the lack of knowledge about him means he remains something of an enigma and lends him an almost superhuman quality.</p> <p>Putin's personality cult received another shrine this week when Ramzan Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3147078/Chechen-capitals-main-street-renamed-Putin-Avenue-after-man-who-bombarded-the-city.html\">named the main street</a> in Grozny after him. It was the bloody war fought to regain control of the republic which cemented Putin's image as a tough guy and went a long way to securing him the presidency in 2000.</p> <p>At the moment, the image of a strong man correlates with the dominant narrative, endlessly pushed by the Kremlin, of Russia as a strong, rich and powerful country. But what happens when the chinks in the armour appear and the pictures don't match up any more?</p> <p>The Russian stock market has been diving in recent weeks, kicked off by Putin's aggressive criticism of the steel company <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/business/worldbusiness/26steel.html\">Mechel</a> in July and the war in Georgia in August. If the world economic crisis continues and pushes oil prices down too far, it will be interesting to see how the knock-on effects are squared with his image.</p>",
  "<p>The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian and the Observer, is being wound up after 72 years and its assets transferred to a new limited company. </p> <p>The trust, created in 1936 to protect the legacy of the longstanding editor and former owner of the Guardian, CP Scott, is being replaced by The Scott Trust Limited so that the independence of the Guardian is placed on a \"very secure footing for the future\"\u201a Scott Trust chair Dame Liz Forgan said. </p> <p>\"Over the 72 years of its existence the Scott Trust has periodically re-examined its structure to make sure it is in the best possible shape to guarantee the ongoing independence of the Guardian - the core purpose of the trust,\" Forgan said.</p> <p>\"The new body has been incorporated in the same spirit as the original trust, it has the same values and goals, and the reorganisation has no effect on the day-to-day management or control of [Guardian Media Group].</p> <p>\"It does, however, renew our commitment to preserve the legacy of CP Scott, further strengthen the protection afforded to GMG and the Guardian, and keep us on a very secure footing for the future.\"</p> <p>The decision was taken because like all non-charitable trusts, the Scott Trust has a finite lifespan, unlike limited companies. </p> <p>The trust transferred ownership of GMG - which controls Guardian News &amp; Media, publisher of MediaGuardian.co.uk, GMG Regional Media, GMG Radio, GMG Property Services and Apax Partner joint ventures Emap and Trader Media Group - to the new parent, The Scott Trust Limited, at the beginning of the month. </p> <p>All Scott trustees became directors of The Scott Trust Limited, with Dame Liz Forgan as chair. </p> <p>The current trustees all hold shares in the new company but there was no change to their responsibilities. </p> <p>GMG's day-to-day operations, control and corporate governance were not affected, with the GMG board retaining \"responsibility for direct oversight of the management of the group\", the trust said. </p> <p>In a statement released today it added: \"The change has no impact on the amount of tax GMG pays - or will pay in future - under current legislation. </p> <p>\"It does address the hypothetical risk of future changes in inheritance tax law that could, in theory, threaten the Guardian's independence.\"</p> <p>Once the restructuring is complete, the Scott Trust will be wound up. </p> <p>Forgan reassured staff that the core purposes of the Scott Trust has been enshrined in the new company.</p> <p>The core purpose of the trust is: \"To secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition; as a profit-seeking enterprise managed in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\"</p> <p>Forgan paid tribute to former GMG chairman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/03/guardianmediagroup.mediabusiness\">Paul Myners, who resigned on Friday to become government minister for the City</a>.</p> <p>\"On a separate note, I'd like to thank Paul Myners for his enormous contribution to the success of GMG over the last eight years.

  "<p>The Tokyo Games Show isn't the only event of interest happening this week; the <a href=\"http://www.virtualworldsforum.com/\">Virtual Worlds Forum</a> is currently taking place in London (albeit in a slightly different format than initially expected due to an unfortunate criminal incident in the venue the day before the show started), and everywhere you turn in the capital are people trying to get you to get another life.</p> <p>As so many leaders in this space have descended, it was a clear opportunity to track some of them down and get their views on the state of the industry in 2008. First on the list is <a href=\"http://www.gaiaonline.com/\">Gaia Online</a> - a phenomenally successful anime social network. They've got a massive following, having doubled their user base in the past year, and are just about to launch a new gaming platform, <em>zOMG!</em>. I asked CEO Craig Sherman some difficult questions about how to bring social networking to the great gaming unwashed.<br><br><strong>Anime is still a niche in the UK, yet Gaia continues to go from strength to strength, doubling its population in Europe in the past year. What makes it so successful?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Gaia's anime look is a distinctive art style and component of our brand personality that we're proud of. It allows Gaia's brand to express the same&nbsp;kind of range, diversity and personality of our ever growing audience. We've grown from 1/2 mm unique visitors a month two years ago to 7mm last month largely based on word of mouth. We know our look is part of our success, but that doesn't account for all of our growth. One might glance&nbsp;at Gaia Online and think, \"it's for anime fans.\" But Gaians know it's radically broader than that. Was Wall-E or Ratatouille for people only into cartoons? The 'voice' (writing style) on Gaia Online is much closer to The Daily Show or Saturday Night Live than a graphic novel. We'll never abandon our roots in anime culture but the truth is that we've grown to be much more of a mainstream attracting teens and young adults with a wide variety of passions and interests.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Gaia is a social network-slanted virtual world. Why should gamers be interested in it?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Gaia is a community for people in their teens and twenties who love gaming, cool art, and fantasy - basically for creative souls to hang out away from the pressures of the offline world. You don't quit your games or quit your social network to go hang on Gaia - you do both simultaneously. For example, we have some of the largest message boards for gaming that you'll find anywhere on the net.&nbsp;Social networks are a tool, just the 21st century version of the telephone. Gaia Online, on the other hand,&nbsp;feels like a place to go hangout - much more like going downtown with your friends. But here's the amazing thing: people may come to Gaia to play games, etc. - but they stay because they've made their best friends on the site.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Tell me about zOMG!: when's it launching, what is it? How will it change the world?</strong>&nbsp;<br>zOMG! doesn't require a download and it's free. It's Flash-based so you can play on your computer or a friend's computer, as long as you have an Internet connection. There's no waiting 15 minutes to download or going to a store to buy software. It will be the first truly free (no hidden up sell to subscription to unlock areas) MMO built in Flash. It's also super-social: you actually get stronger if you play with other people nearby. And it's totally integrated into the larger world of Gaia so when you're bored of fighting you can hang out and play puzzle games or talk about your favorite celebrities, fashion, or gaming, or just check out other users' art, fiction etc. It's truly bigger than a typical game. When does it come out? Soon. :-)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What do virtual worlds have to offer games design?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Virtual worlds are radically more accessible than traditional hard core MMOs. They are easier to jump into and get started. They require far, far less time commitment than traditional MMOs, and they are much more social. The best of them, like Gaia Online, celebrate self-expression. On Gaia you can be who you really are - without the limits of reality imposed on you. It's liberating.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What do you think are the best ways virtual worlds designers can best communicate that to game developers?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Smart game developers will spend time in sites like Gaia and pick up the clues. Mark Kern, the CEO of Red5 studios (and formerly the producer of WOW) makes all his new employees use Gaia Online to pick up tips.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>You'll be speaking about virtual world best practices; best practices for what? And what are they?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Virtual worlds have grown fast because they do two things very well. First, they empower people to be more than they can be in the real world (put another way: be who they really are instead of who they've been 'typed as' by their peers). Second, they connect like-minded souls through entertainment. You come to play, but through the social aspects of the world, you make your friends. Games like WOW pioneered this second point, almost as a side-effect of the game play. Sites like Gaia have taken the concept and transformed it: instead of bonding through fighting monsters, in Gaia you bond by watching movies like the matrix for free in a virtual theater with others, you can then join a Keanu Reeves fan club or get Morpheus' jacket and pinzers.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What responsibilities do developers have to their users? For example, if (heaven forbid) the credit crunch started to take its toll and you needed to close down, what would happen to the community that's developed via Gaia?</strong>&nbsp;<br>We exist first and foremost to deliver a great quality experience to our users. We are very conservative and have raised funds to ensure we can continue operations in case the economy worsened. Right now, we're still growing rapidly.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Which other online communities - other than Gaia - do you think are doing innovative work?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Kongregate is impressive. They've grown extremely quickly by positioning themselves as the 'YouTube for Flash games.' Roblox, which is targeted at males under the age of 11. QQ (ten cent corporation) in China. Also there are a lot of interesting communities developing outside of the gaming space: medhelp.org in the health space and Yelp! in the restaurant space are two of the best examples.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Tomorrow we feature Dizzywood, a children's virtual world trying to make it in the education market. Friday we're opening the doors of Habbo Hotel, the most successful Western social virtual world on the market</em></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today said the British government planned to sue Iceland to recover the deposits of thousands of savers in the nation's stricken banks.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/08/banks.savings3\">had earlier </a> guaranteed that the government would cover deposits of British savers with Icesave, which yesterday stopped customers from withdrawing money from their accounts</p> <p>The British government also seized control of Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander and put the business into administration, transferring the \u00a32.5bn of retail deposits in its Kaupthing Edge accounts to ING Direct. Kaupthing is the largest bank in Iceland and the only one left of the big three still operating in private hands.</p> <p>Iceland's woes deepened further this afternoon when Reykjavik put the third largest Icelandic bank Glitnir into receivership. The government had nationalised the bank two weeks ago but the central bank governor David Oddsson told Icelandic television that the \"difficulties of the bank were much greater\" than previously estimated.</p> <p>The central bank also abandoned efforts to put a floor under its slumping currency by pegging it to the euro.</p> <p>In a news conference today, Brown pledged legal action against the Icelandic government for refusing to honour its obligations after customers were prevented from taking money out of Icesave, an online British arm of Iceland's second biggest bank Landsbanki.</p> <p>Landsbanki was taken over by Icelandic authorities yesterday after emergency legislation designed to prevent the tiny nation's economy going into a complete meltdown.</p> <p>\"We are showing by our action that we stand by people who save,\" Brown said.</p> <p>\"We are taking legal action against the Icelandic authorities, to recover the money lost to people who deposited in UK branches of its banks.\"</p> <p>Iceland has suffered a tumultuous few weeks. The country's government is scrambling to save the economy from collapse and has asked Russia for a \u20ac4bn loan.</p> <p>It has introduced emergency laws earlier giving the government sweeping new powers to take over banks, force them to merge or even into bankruptcy. </p> <p>But the country appeared to sink deeper into the financial crisis today. </p> <p>Sweden is granting liquidity assistance to the Swedish arms of Kaupthing, with a total loan of up to 5bn crowns (\u00a3400m).</p> <p>ING Direct UK, the British division of the Dutch bank, is buying more than \u00a33bn of deposits held by around 180,000 British savers with Kaupthing Edge, the UK arm.</p> <p>The group also signed an agreement with the Treasury to acquire deposits from Heritable Bank, another British division of Landsbanki.</p> <p>Today's action by Sweden comes a day after the Icelandic prime minister, Geir H Haarde, publicly criticised the lack of assistance the country has received from Europe.</p> <p>The central bank said it believed that Kaupthing was solvent, but was suffering temporary liquidity problems that could have wider repercussions.</p> <p>\"To safeguard financial stability in Sweden and ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets, the Riksbank has therefore decided to grant liquidity assistance to Kaupthing Sverige,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>With the deregulation of its financial market in the mid-1990s and subsequent stockmarket boom, Iceland had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/iceland.creditcrunch\">transformed itself</a> into one of the wealthiest nations in Europe.</p> <p>Many Icelandic banks and companies have invested heavily in Europe, making it even more important to ensure that turmoil is contained.</p> <p>Kaupthing has also invested in European retail groups, and racked up debts of more than $5.25bn (\u00a33bn) to help fund British deals.</p> <p>The Icelandic government said today that it had extended its own $680m loan to Kaupthing to tide it over.</p> <p>Trading in the bank was halted on the Nasdaq-OMX, after its shares plunged 34% this morning.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/16/pinkfloyd.popandrock\">recent passing of Pink Floyd's Rick Wright</a> reminded me how my love of that band provoked so much scorn from friends who believed that post-hardcore groups like Sebadoh and Slint were the only viable forms of musical expression. A couple of years later, one of those friends conceded that Wish You Were Here was a bleakly beautiful song and that the Floyd were not quite the pompous prog behemoths of legend. </p> <p>However, I can understand why they might seem dismissive, especially when considering the way in which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pinkfloyd\">Pink Floyd</a> have been saddled with the lazy and much-maligned term \"progressive rock\". This is unfortunate, as all the terrible hallmarks of what we traditionally call prog rock are absent from their music. So click below to find out how Pink Floyd avoided the prog-rock pitfalls to emerge as a brilliant band.</p> <p><strong>Wacky time signatures</strong><br>Pink Floyd rarely indulged in the show-off polymetric twaddle practised by Genesis or Yes. Genesis' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FraoJitaP7I\">Dance on a Volcano</a> nearly made my A-level students sick when I played it to them as an example of prog rock. The ponderous 7/4 theme is genuinely queasy, with the melodic phrase feeling unfinished on the sixth beat. The seventh beat hangs in mid-air without function and induces an unpleasant vertigo sensation. It's completely unnecessary because, if they had continued the syncopation set up by the fifth note of the melody, the flow of this phrase would have naturally formed a seven-beat cycle. The only notable song where the Floyd lapse into an unusual metre is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl6NfQyNLto\">Money</a>, one of their most commercially successful songs, which lopes along a 7/4 bass riff without batting an eyelid. They could do wacky time signatures if they fancied, without inspiring the likes of Marillion.</p> <p><strong>Jazz: Delicious hot, disgusting cold</strong><br>Rick Wright was the most traditionally tutored musician in the Floyd and the other band members often spoke of the jazz influence he brought to the group. However, the most remarkable thing about Rick's training is how he let himself be moulded by the experimental tendencies of Syd Barrett and Roger Waters. It is testament to his sympathetic and sensitive ability that I rarely hear a jazz influence in Rick's work, even his own compositions. His best known, the headache-inducing/soothing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enwnt7-j90k\">Great Gig in the Sky</a>, contains jazzy seventh chords, but is really just a series of beautiful chord progressions, and not jazz in any meaningful way. If you listen to the vile interpolation of jazz that erupts five minutes into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-C4qsyodo4&amp;feature=related\">King Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid Man</a> you will understand how a great Black Sabbath-style slab of noise can be ruined by prog excess. </p> <p><strong>Lyrics</strong><br>The extent of swords and sorcery lyrics in prog is overstated, but when it strays from Tolkien it rarely improves. As with the music, an over-zealous air of trying to be clever prevails: \"Complaining tongues are stilled; a thousand mouths are filled with rusting metal\" sing Van de Graaf Generator, as if anticipating criticism. Hmmm. Compare most of the nonsense in prog rock with the casual spite of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KheDjhFck94\">Pink Floyd's Dogs</a>, which is as ferocious as punk, as elegiac as Wish You Were Here and as hazily nostalgic as Fat Old Sun. Good stuff I promise you. </p> <p><strong>Be careful what you borrow</strong><br>Too often, prog rock is about nicking half-baked ideas from genuinely progressive music and executing them poorly. If you want unsettlingly beautiful shifting washes of texture then try <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2OQbA3r78M\">Ligeti's Lontano</a>, which predates the irritatingly new age Tangerine Dream. If you want to be rhythmically challenged, then forget the horrific noodling of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEfZY04fsr0&amp;feature=related\">Yes</a> and check out B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, who was inspired by the addictive rhythms of his native Hungary's folk music. Or in case I'm getting too Eurocentric, try the terrifyingly odd polyrhythms of Captain Beefheart and Steve Reich's mesmeric phase-shifting.</p> <p>So there. Pink Floyd: not prog rock and excellent to boot. Strangely detached, but intensely moving; bleak but heartfelt. No Mars Volta or Muse, not even Radiohead (too much angst in that voice) are carrying the legacy of this incredibly idiosyncratic band forward. Strange echoes occur in odd places. I can hear similar lyrical themes of reserved English desperation set to fascinatingPink Floyd arrangements on Field Music's excellent Tones of Town. </p> <p>Where else can I get my fix now there's no hope of that reunion?</p>",
  "<p>The number of women having successful IVF treatment in the UK has topped 10,000 for the first time.</p> <p>There were 10,242 births, resulting in 12,596 babies, in 2006 - a 13% rise on the number of births the previous year, according to the regulatory body for fertility clinics in the UK.</p> <p>Nearly a quarter (23.1%) of treatment cycles resulted in a live birth in 2006, up 1.5% for on the previous year, the figures, from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), revealed. </p> <p>The success rate has risen by just over 10% since 1992, when the HFEA started collecting data on IVF treatment. That year, the live birth rate was 13%.</p> <p>The number of patients and the number of treatments being undertaken in the UK also increased.</p> <p>A total of 34,855 women were treated at UK clinics in 2006, a rise of 6.8% on the previous year. They underwent 44,275 cycles of IVF treatment, up 5.6% on the previous year.</p> <p>The clinic with the highest success rate was that run by the controversial doctor Mohamed Taranissi, who is under investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC). His Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre (ARGC) in London achieved double the national average for live births as a result of fertility treatment.</p> <p>Taranissi, 53, is being investigated by a GMC fitness to practice panel over allegations - which he denies - relating to the treatment of two female patients at his clinic.</p> <p>Overall success rates increased in every age group. For women under 35 using their own fresh eggs, the live birth rate was 31% compared with 29.6% in 2005. </p> <p>For women over 40 using their own fresh eggs, the rate increased from 0.8% in 2005 to 4% in 2006.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the multiple birth rate fell from 24% of births in 2005 to 22.7% in 2006. </p> <p>The HFEA has been urging clinics to cut the number of multiple births as a result of fertility treatment because they carry risks for both mothers and babies.</p> <p>Donor insemination treatments fell by more than a quarter (28%,) with 4,225 treatments carried out in 2006 compared with 5,865 in 2005.</p> <p>A 2005 change in the law, which removed the sperm donors' right to anonymity, has been largely blamed for a decrease in the number of donors coming forward.</p> <p>\"In the year that we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the birth of the world's first IVF baby, these latest figures show just how far we've come,\" Professor Lisa Jardine, the chair of the HFEA, said.</p> <p>\"IVF is now commonplace, with the number of treatment cycles and births rising yet again.\"</p> <p>However, she said the drop in the number of donor insemination cycles was of \"great concern\" to patients needing donor sperm.</p>",

  "<p>The Lebanese reckon that they invented hummus and want to sue the Jewish state for stealing and rebranding it. \"<a href=\"http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1027016.html\">The Israelis</a> are marketing our main food dishes as if they were Israeli dishes,\" explains the president of the Lebanese Industrialists Association, Fadi Abboud, adding that this is causing million-dollar losses for the Cedar economy. </p> <p>It's true that Lebanese hummus is the pedigree of dips, but in reality nobody knows exactly who first started making the stuff \u2013 although obviously the cuisine predates Israel. It's been eaten in the Middle East for centuries and some hold that there are <a href=\"http://humus101.com/EN/2006/10/10/6/\">references</a> to a hummus-like substance in the Bible. </p> <p>Others say it appeared in the Arab world \u2013 including Palestine \u2013 during Ottoman times. Indeed, the blogosphere is busy with the question of who can rightfully claim to have created hummus (God being my current favourite). </p> <p>Whatever the genesis, it is definitely true to say that Israelis are hummus fanatics \u2013 you can't take two strides in the country without falling upon a hummus stand. I've had frequent, lengthy debates about <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/liormania/1552936704/\">the best places</a> to dine on the chickpea delight and it's not uncommon for people to plan day trips around a specific hummus pit-stop. </p> <p>There's even \u2013 and this really is a bit obsessive, I feel \u2013 a Hebrew verb for the act of wiping the paste off your plate with straps of pitta bread. Palestinian-Israelis (or \"Arab-Israelis\", if we must) are sometimes bemused by this preoccupation, since they view hummus as a starter and not the main event.</p> <p>Israelis, who are often rather condescending or just plain ignorant about Arab culture, do accept the superiority of Arab cuisine. They know this to be the case because Jews who migrated to Israel from Arab countries brought the best cooking with them. </p> <p>This is not under dispute and not even a loaded statement \u2013 European Jewish larders just weren't as bountifully stocked, which made their diets go bland. Acknowledging this food hierarchy means that any prospect of peace and normalised relations with the Arab world has an immediate hypothetical outcome for Israelis: to go and eat hummus in Damascus. </p> <p>Still, it's one thing to admire a neighbour's cooking, quite another to name it your own national dish, as Israelis have done for hummus and that other Middle Eastern chickpea favourite, falafel.</p> <p>And it's not just the Lebanese who are riled; it's the subject of low-level complaints among Palestinians too, along the lines of: \"First they take our land, now our food ...\" In a similar vein, Palestinians within Israel sometimes grumble about the Jewish state seizing language, since Modern Hebrew has borrowed from the Arabic dictionary \u2013 of curses, in particular.</p> <p><a href=\"http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/08/30/10150036.html\">Infuriating as this must be</a>, it's unlikely that the hummus takeover was an orchestrated plan of colonial appropriation; more probably, the dish was around in the area and people got hooked on it (in the best tradition of Middle East conspiracy theories, there are a few about the addictive properties of hummus).</p> <p>In any case, deep down Israelis doubtless know that hummus isn't really their national dish, that international law wouldn't recognise it as such, and that sooner or later they're just going to have to give it back.</p>",
  "<p>London's stockmarket was back in the red this afternoon after a brief rally sparked by a round of coordinated emergency half-point cuts in interest rates from major central banks including the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.</p> <p>The FTSE 100, which plunged by almost 360 points, or 7.8%, in early trading, rocketed into positive territory after the shock rate move, which is the Bank of England's first emergency rate cut since the aftermath of 9/11.

Fears over the worsening global crisis drove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.japan\">Asian markets sharply lower</a>. Japan's Nikkei dropped by 9.4%, its biggest one-day decline since the 1987 stockmarket crash. The Indonesian stockmarkets were suspended indefinitely after its benchmark index plunged more than 10%.

  "<p>You could understand Kit Malthouse wishing his life were duller. His boss, Boris Johnson, took most of the spotlight in recent dramas concerning the Metropolitan Police but it is Malthouse, the London mayor's <a href=\"http://www.kitmalthouse.com/bio.php\">deputy for policing</a>, who continues to handle the fallout. It was Malthouse who toured the studios last week defending his and the mayor's effective unseating of Ian Blair, and Malthouse who must now see that a credible team is formed to inquire into the already hugely damaging allegation that ethnic minority officers are blocked by racist attitudes from securing the service's most senior posts. </p> <p>As the BBC and the Troy Troll have <a href=\"http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/10/bbc-london-report-on-kit-malthouses.html\">reported</a>, Malthouse is to receive \u00a352,000 in allowances from the <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/default.htm\">Metropolitan Police Authority</a> of which he is vice-chair, on the basis that he'll be doing the job five days a week and on the understanding that he, not Johnson, is the one really in charge. It is legitimate to ask how he will also find the time to earn the \u00a354,000 a year he is paid for representing a GLA constituency while also taking an income from the Mayfair-based City investment firm he co-founded. It is also, though, fair to point out that his total income from the taxpayer is less than is paid to the majority of Johnson's assorted directors and deputies, and that his may be the toughest task of all. </p> <p>The Met crisis presents Johnson's barely settled administration with a potentially catastrophic combination of issues. Crime and racism are topics that demand careful handling by any politician, but by Johnson more than any at this time. He came to power in May promising to rejuvenate the capital's policing and in spite of substantial majorities of ethnic minority voters preferring Livingstone, some suspecting Johnson of, at best, indifference to historic patterns of prejudice against them. </p> <p>They did so with good reason: Johnson does not deserve the label \"racist\" which some still stick on him. Neither is it accurate to claim that he was among those on the right who poured scorn on the Macpherson report, which brought the term \"institutional racism\" into common currency. On the contrary, he <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200101/ai_n8930080/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1\">defended it</a>. </p> <p>Johnson does, though, have a history of mocking so-called \"political correctness\", a term rooted in reactionaries' bitter resentment of fair play for fellow citizens. Moreover, his director of policy, Anthony Browne, who has started work for him this week, has written an entire \u2013 and entirely rubbishy \u2013 book on this non-subject, as well as articles for the Spectator under Johnson's editorship which heaped derision on the notion that London's cosmopolitanism might be a virtue and a source of strength. As a Londoner, I find it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/london.boris\">wrong and rather creepy</a> that a man holding such views is to have a major influence on the future of my city. Browne has some explaining to do, as does the mayor for hiring him. </p> <p>The side of Johnson that rebels against campaigns for equal rights surfaced again, very recently, in his recent speech at the Tory conference. In it, he attacked what he called the \"grievance culture\" of the Met, a clear reference to the alarming number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/29/police.race\">discrimination claims</a> recently brought against their employer by black and Asian officers.</p> <p>Was it proper for a London mayor shortly to assume the chair of the MPA to dismiss these cases, whose full details he does not know, with a crowd-pleasing rhetorical flourish? Was it wise? Certainly, it will not have gone unnoticed by the Metropolitan Black Police Association, which has subsequently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/07/police.race\">withdrawn its support</a> for the Met's recruitment strategies aimed at attracting black and Asian applicants, citing \"a hostile atmosphere where racism is allowed to spread\". </p> <p>It should be noted that the Association of Muslim Police is opposed to this boycott. But Johnson appears now to have spotted that the deep seriousness of the situation demands something other than a curt dismissal. His <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23564179-details/My+vision+for+the+future+of+London's+policing/article.do\">address</a> to the MPA meeting on Monday concluded with an assertion, quoting <a href=\"http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/SirRobertPeel.htm\">Robert Peel</a> along the way, that \"if 'the police are the public, and the public are the police', then the police must resemble the communities they serve,\" and his announcement that independent MPA member <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/about/members/02butts.htm\">Cindy Butts</a> will lead an inquiry into the progress of ethnic minority candidates trough the police ranks. He rightly recognised that resolving this corrosive issue has direct implications for public trust in the Met, the key to effective policing.</p> <p>The pressure is now on for the Butts inquiry to demonstrate true independence from the police establishment. It falls to her and to Kit Malthouse to sort this out, and to Malthouse to ensure in the longer term that the closer alignment he desires between the mechanisms of mayoralty and Met help to justify the greater purchase the former has achieved over the latter by virtue of the removal of Blair. This assertion of mayoral power may indeed make the Met more accountable, as those who've applauded it claim, but that by no means guarantees that the right sorts of reform will result. </p> <p>I do not know the rights and wrongs of all those discrimination cases, but I do know that it is unacceptable for habits of discrimination to go uncorrected in any publicly-funded organisation whose efficiency depends on public confidence, the police service most of all. Malthouse is a highly capable, determined and thoughtful man of liberal social attitudes who professes dislike for his recent billing by the media as the mayor's hatchet man. He'll need all these strengths for the huge task before him. It is vital that he does it well.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to relationships, power can be a burden. In casual relationships, there are always two participants: the one in control, and the one who follows. </p> <p>Women can get a little obsessive about power struggles. We're told by the glossies that men are usually the guilty party \u2013 they lie more easily; the blood rushes from their heads downwards; they are lacking a fidelity gene; women are damned lucky if they hold on to one for longer than a pair of jeans. </p> <p>It's true that there will always be one party with more power than the other, but it's not always the man. Alpha Businesswoman Friend, for example, always has the upper hand. It's all down to language. \"He tells me he loves me. I say, 'I love what you do to me,'\" she explained,</p> <p>When Joe the Third called her a bitch during a drunken quarrel, it was the end. Quite admirably, she told me: \"No one disrespects me.\" </p> <p>It was inevitable that as Big Ex and I saw more and more of each other, a power imbalance started to grow - like a weed, not a flower.</p> <p>This time around, it was Big Ex who was doing the running. Actually, he was driving - out to the sticks each week, even when his windscreen wipers were wrenched off by a drunk in a pub car park. </p> <p>On Thursday morning he left at 5am for the commute to work. It was so frosty I had to shuffle to the kettle in my fleece dressing gown. Even after dressing, I wrapped my gown over my clothes and rather wished that Big Ex was still there to keep me warm. </p> <p>He called again on Monday wanting to visit again on Tuesday night. What was I up to? In truth I wanted to sit alone and nurse the last strands of a hangover, to eat a Thai curry and watch Peggy Mitchell and Pat Butcher have a scrap on BBC iPlayer. But I couldn't say that. And I'm not a good liar.<br> Surely when you're being chased rather than chasing, you're supposed to be in control. So why does power make you feel so guilty? </p> <p>About an hour after agreeing to see him, I called the local surgery and booked an evening visit. Then I telephoned Big Ex and said a doctor's appointment had slipped my mind. My evening was spent in the company of a travel nurse, a yellow fever jab and a reaction like a nasty bout of flu. </p> <p>That's karma, I suppose.</p>",

Other factors include the truce declared by anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada al Sadr, the leader of an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militia; and the enlistment of former Sunni insurgents in Awakening groups created by the U.S. military to fight al Qaida in Iraq and other extremists.</p> <p>The draft NIE, however, warns that the improvements in security and political progress, like the recent passage of a provincial election law, are threatened by lingering disputes between the majority Shiite Arabs, Sunni Arabs, Kurds and other minorities, the U.S. officials said.</p> <p>Sources of tension identified by the NIE, they said, include a struggle between Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen for control of the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk; and the Shiite-led central government's unfulfilled vows to hire former Sunni insurgents who joined Awakening groups.</p> </blockquote> <p>This would seem to benefit Obama slightly more than McCain politically if it comes out before the election, because it would be the official voice of the US government saying that the troop surge was just one of three major factors in the reduction of violence.<br></p>",

Besides which he can always bask in the reflected glamour that comes from his wife's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zN7R7FmOTlU\">drift racing habit</a>. Yes, drift racing. As in The Fast And the Furious 2: Tokyo Drift.</p> <p>Fact is we already have the answer to the bowling question, because as bad as Obama is, he's nothing like <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxQoWHBbaw\">as hopeless as George H W Bush</a>. Obama at least manages to stay on his feet.</p> <p>Actually, Bush Sr and Obama are two of the more accomplished sportsmen to stand for office in recent times. Both of them could at least claim that bowling just isn't their game. Obama <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=j87k1j4CpOw\">sure can shoot hoops</a>, and famously had the nickname Barry O'Bomber for his <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vYCEnVmNkpE\">jump-shooting skills when he was studying at Punahou High</a>.</p> <p>Bush Sr was a slick-fielding first baseman for Yale University after the second world war, and played in two College World Series. He even captained the team, and was apparently \"a lifetime .354 hitter with two home runs and 23 RBI's in 175 at-bats\" though that sounds suspiciously good to me. Sadly there's no footage of Bush to confirm the stats, but he can be <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GdCGWlaSKHA\">seen here trying to explain the game to the Queen</a>.</p> <p>Only two post-war presidents had better sporting credentials. <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5x7eoj\">Gerald Ford was a linebacker for the University of Michigan</a>, and led them through two unbeaten seasons and to a pair of national titles, in 1932 and '33.</p> <p>His predecessor in office, Richard Nixon, was <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Z8ZwjXpW4\">a football obsessive</a>. He became such good friends with the Washington Redskins coach George Allen that during the 1971 season the president was invited by Allen to call an offensive play during a visit to a practice session at Redskins Park.</p> <p>Nixon called an unusual reverse to the wide receiver. When the Redskins reached the NFC play-offs later that year, they were leading 10-3, and in the final minutes of the first half Allen again called the reverse \u2014 a play he never normally used because he thought it was a \"trick play\" (you couldn't make this up, could you?). It failed, the Redskins lost momentum and then the game, 24-20. Afterwards one Redskins player claimed that Allen had received \"executive orders\" to call the reverse, and while the allegation was never confirmed (or denied) by Allen, many commentators alleged that Nixon did indeed phone the coach with instructions during the first quarter.</p> <p>In his book First Off The Tee, Don Van Natta claims Nixon <a href=\"http://www.beauproductions.com/golfswingsws/richardnixon/\">cheated at golf </a>, throwing the ball out of deep rough on to the fairway. Really though you wonder if the stories are just being shaped to fit the man's legacy. There's certainly considerably less evidence that Nixon was a cad on the course than there is that Bill Clinton was. </p> <p>Clinton is infamous for taking repeated 'Billigans' each time he mishit, claiming each shank was a simple practice swing. Tiger Woods told this story about playing a round the two men played together:</p> <p>\"President Clinton rolls one in the bushes, so then hits another one off the tee ... right in the middle of the fairway, hits a nice little wedge shot up there to about, I don't know, 6-7 feet. I hit a bad pitch, I blasted it by about 12 feet. ... Then all of the sudden, he does one of these,\" Woods gestures picking up a ball, \"It was 6-7 feet and he walked off the green ... So I'm sitting in the cart. He's writing down the numbers, I happen to kind of ...\" Woods leans back as if reading a scorecard over someone's shoulder, \"Woods 4, Clinton 3. Interesting maths.\" With 14 of the last 17 presidents playing golf, Clinton was reputedly driven by a desire not to be seen as the Duffer in Chief.</p> <p>JFK kept a lot of secrets, and his golf habit was certainly one of them. His predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, spent so much time on the golf course (<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=K-bRB9ggpIs\">often partnering Bob Hope</a>) that he was accused of wanting to introduce a \"36-hole working week\". Keen to avoid the accusation that he was similarly work-shy, JFK kept quiet about the fact that he was <a href=\"http://beauproductions.com/golfswingsws/kennedy/index.html\">so keen on the game</a> he could get around in under 80. His secret passion was only revealed, according to Van Natta, when \"there were all these rumours about JFK and other extracurricular activities. He was sneaking off doing other things and [spokesman] Pierre Salinger had to tell people, 'No, no, no. He's playing golf.' That was better than the alternative.\"</p> <p>While Michael Moore made <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3p9y_OEAdc\"> a lot of comedy capital out of George W Bush's golf game</a>, Dubya generally prefers to limit his sporting interests to the sidelines and the odd ceremonial first pitch, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=8jmV3XqBOMU&amp;feature=related\">one</a> or <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDsshpG_Oo\">two</a> attempts to play cricket aside (seems like he was quicker to grasp <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/rugby.asp\">the essentials of rugby</a> when he played it at Harvard).</p> <p>With Ronald Reagan never coming closer to sporting glory than when he hammed it up as <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HvYa9NqKM\">George Gipp in the B-Movie Knute Rockne: All American</a> (if you don't know the story of \"win just one for the Gipper\" then <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPTdliKmk\">Murdoch from the A-Team will explain it better than I ever could</a>), there's not much to compete with Putin.</p> <p>No, if the US want a president to match-up to Putin on the mat, they'd have to go back to Salem County wrestling champion Abraham Lincoln, whose long reach made him, in his own words, \"the second best wrestler in south Illinois\".

  "<p>Boris Johnson today claimed early success in honouring his pledge to reduce crime and disorder on London's public transport system. </p> <p>Announcing that dedicated police teams would be deployed across 30 locations in January 2009, the capital's mayor produced statistics showing that robberies on buses had fallen by nearly 38%, violent crime by 5.6% and \"overall crime\" by 16%, as a result of trials at three transport \"hubs\" in different parts of the city. <br> Johnson added that separate teams tackling bus crime already based in 11 inner-London boroughs would now be \"made permanent\" after \"bus-related crime in the borough was reduced in the boroughs served by the teams by 13.6% in recent months.\" These teams were introduced by Ken Livingstone, Johnson's predecessor as mayor, in March. Johnson released the information in the company of Transport for London's commissioner, Peter Hendy, his deputy for policing, Kit Malthouse, and senior police officers at a press conference in Bexleyheath police station, thereby honouring, he said, another pledge, this being to take a close interest in London's suburbs, where voters had a decisive influence in his securing power.  The mayor's confidence in the official police data \u2013 which also showed a substantial fall in reported sexual offences \u2013 was in marked contrast to his scepticism about such figures during this year's election campaign, when Livingstone regularly cited police figures to back his claim that crime had fallen across the board under his mayoralty. </p> <p>Quizzed about this by theguardian.com, Johnson appeared to acknowledge that his attitude had changed since joining \"the frontline\" at City Hall. He asserted that he was using \"the best statistics we have\". <br> Guardian.co.uk has learned that the mayor has plans to compile and publish his own statistics about crime in London, which will be unaffected by the changes in definitions and categorisations over time that make long-term assessments of crime levels more difficult. In another shift of position since the election, this one more of emphasis, Johnson went out of his way to stress that \"I don't believe there is a plague of out-of-control kids all across London. There is a minority that needs to be deterred. We need to create reassurance.\"  Answering questions on the financial crisis and the implications of the credit crunch on Londoners, Johnson repeated his view that \"there has been greed and deceit\" among London's bankers but that \"we must navigate a way out of this that does not punish innocent members of the financial services industry.\"  He declined an offer to propose a limit on City bonuses, saying he was no more likely to do that than pronounce on Premiership footballers' wages, but he expressed faith that in the present climate \"it was highly unlikely that people will award themselves exorbitant bonuses\". </p> <p>Johnson also renewed his plea to the government not to preside over reductions in investment in London public transport infrastructure projects, such as Crossrail and the upgrading of the London Underground. With Britain \"allegedly teetering on the edge of a recession\" that would be \"the very worst thing we could do\", he said.<br> Asked how he intended to continue honouring his commitments on crime when the Metropolitan police was being required to make economies, Malthouse indicated that important savings would be made through the greater \"civilianisation\" of custody suites at police stations, which would be \"cheaper and arguably more efficient\".</p> <p>Hendy explained that TfL has been able to contribute to the funding of the new transport police provision, largely as a result of not having to implement Livingstone's election pledge to bring in higher congestion charge for so-called \"gas-guzzlers\" and also by making Johnson's consultation on the future of the charge zone's western extension less expensive than the previous one under Livingstone \"in the interest of taxpayer value\".</p>",

Rumpled hair, half-open eyes, and the occasional inability to find the right vocabulary all bear testament to the rigours of the Australia-to-London flight he took yesterday, in order to make it to the UK in time for next week's Booker circus.</p> <p>He doesn't seem particularly well prepared for the media attention coming his way, and makes a song and dance over reading an extract from the book, variously standing up and down, cricking his back, rushing to the loo and fumbling over words.</p> <p>\"Look, until I finished the book I'd never been to a book reading and I never quite understood it, it seemed a bit odd to me why you'd want to hear an author reading his book,\" he says. \"I have not read out loud to anyone over the age of five, ever, so just thought it was a bit odd.\"</p> <p>Toltz is uncomfortable with the idea of nationality, so he probably wouldn't want to hear that he is your typical Antipodean traveller, laid back, scruffy, lethargic and prone to beginning a lot of sentences with \"Look\". Yes, he's excited to be shortlisted for the Booker but on this sunny Tuesday the 36-year-old not exactly animated about it. \"Look, it's funny,\" he says. \"There is an element of arbitrariness about it, only because you know that in a different year five different judges would pick six different books.\" </p> <p>One does also wonder how pleased he is to be generating the press interest, since journalists are described in the book as maggots, grubby parasites, cannibalistic. In fact, he says, the genesis of the book was his fascination with people who are torn apart by the media, but he reassures me that it's never happened to him and he bears no particular grudges. \"Every nation needs somebody to hate at any different time,\" he says, \"but what if you looked up and it was your dad, and the papers were saying your dad is the biggest scumbag in the country \u2013 that's what got me started.\"</p> <p>Thanks to a thwarted plan to make everyone in Australia a millionaire, this is what happens to A Fraction of the Whole's Martin Dean, and by extension to his son Jasper \u2013 but it's a long and circuitous route they follow to get there. Toltz, like the wonderfully bad-tempered misanthrope Martin, is extravagant in his invention; the 700-odd pages of the novel are stuffed with mad creations - a house surrounded by a labyrinth, a democratic cooperative of crime, one character's useful Handbook of Crime (Sample chapter headings: Crime and Fashion: Balaclavas Are Always In, and Motiveless Crimes - Why?)</p> <p>Chair of the Booker judges Michael Portillo described it as a \"very Australian book, wonderfully irreverent\", and Toltz will admit that it is concerned with two very Australian preoccupations \u2013 sport and criminals. \"Look, a lot of these things are things I just noticed about Australia and nobody seemed to be really talking about them. You know when you see something on television and look around the room and think 'is nobody else hearing this?' So a lot of it is about Australia, about their obsession with sport, obsession with criminals - I just thought I'd fuse the two together.\" Hence the character Terry Dean, who wins national treasure status for a killing spree attempting to stamp out corruption in sport.</p> <p>It might be a brick of a book today but A Fraction of the Whole actually began as two short stories that Toltz couldn't bear to stop working on. \"I thought 'that story looks like the beginning of something, that one looks like the end of something. Now I just have to string them together'. Except the middle took a bit longer than I'd anticipated,\" he says. \"Look, I knew where I was going but I didn't know how to get there. I knew the end point, it was just the middle point, to actually get to that point, that was really, I won't say out of control, but it was a surprise for me. If I knew a story page by page before I started writing it I just wouldn't do it. The process of discovery is really important for my own enjoyment.\"</p> <p>It took him five years and extensive revisions to complete the book, working his way around the world in a more or less random series of jobs, from telemarketer to data entry clerk, private investigator (not as interesting as it sounds, he says), cameraman and film extra. \"I knew I was working on this and didn't want to have a fallback career - for fear of falling back on it,\" he says. \"I'm not sure if I always wanted to be a writer, but I was always writing \u2026 I actually went into writing first to supplement my income, which was a strange thing to do and actually failed. So if a short story competition came up I would enter that, or a radio competition \u2013 it was my default hobby. So I just kept doing that, and eventually realised when people would ask 'what do you do?', I'd be 'I'm a writer', because that's the only thing I was doing.\"</p> <p>Toltz studied video production at university in Australia, but was horrified to discover he'd got to the end of his degree without reading a book. \"I thought I'd squandered my education, I got into a panic about it. So I went to the university of New South Wales, went to the Russian literature department, said 'give me a reading list', and started working my way through it.\" </p> <p>Like his protagonists Jasper and Martin, Toltz has gone on to steep himself in literature, and finds the authors he's been reading have a tendency to pop up in his own writing. \"If I read someone with a very strong voice and find it creeping into my work, that's a pleasure too. I can read parts [of A Fraction of the Whole] and think 'that's the bit I wrote while reading Raymond Chandler.'\" He also cites Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Knut Hamsun and John Fante as influences.</p> <p>The world travel, upping sticks regularly with his French wife, also fed into the writing, he thinks. \"The mind reboots every time, for me, in a new environment. You look at things slightly differently, it's fresher, it opens the door a little bit more.\" </p> <p>Relative poverty seems to have been quite useful, too. When he was teaching English, and writing his novel, in Spain, he lived in a room with no electricity for a year. \"When you take out bills, rent, phone, electricity, gas, internet, mobile phone bills and you only need to eat and drink, it does give you a lot more space.\"</p> <p>His roaming soul means Toltz is back on the road \u2013 Bondi Beach was home for a while, but after the Booker is over and done with, he's off to France for a couple of months, and then who knows where. \"We're back to living out of a suitcase,\" he says. \"It's good while we can.\" He'll be working on his second novel, of which he's unwilling to say much as he's sure it will go through \"28 epiphanies\" before it's done, but admits he's just discovered Chilean writer Roberto Bola\u00f1o, \"and that's feeling like an influence\".</p> <p>And his hopes for the Booker? \"I honestly think my chances are one in six,\" he deadpans. \"I've started going through [the other shortlisted] books and reading them - so far so good. I feel I'm in good company, and I will be pleased if I lose to a book I really like.\"</p>",
  "<p>The NYT does <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08mortgage.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">a decent job</a> of explaining McCain's mortgage proposal from last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Obama camp is correct that the new $700 billion bailout of the financial system gives the Treasury the authority to buy troubled mortgages. But the law leaves unclear how the authority is to be used, according to a person who was privy to the recent legislative negotiations between the White House and Congress and who is not affiliated with either campaign.</p> <p>The mortgage renewal idea actually originated with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. And Mrs. Clinton, who proposed the idea in a recent newspaper column, borrowed it from a Depression-era New Deal agency, the Home Owner's Loan Corporation.</p> <p>As Mr. McCain's campaign described his program, it would be available to mortgagors for whom the property is their primary residence, who can prove they were creditworthy when the original loan was made and who made a down payment.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I gather from this that last week's bailout gave Treasury the authority but not necessarily the obligation to negotiate directly with homeowners, while McCain's/Hillary's proposal would oblige Treasury to do so. I guess that sounds mostly all right to me, but if it sounds all right to me, it probably doesn't sound so good to, say, <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=28907\">Newt Gingrich</a>.<br></p>",
  "<p>Any regular visitor to Paris will be able to recite the cultural staples of the city off by heart. There's the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay with its Impressionist classics, the Comedi\u00e9 Francaise with its lavish Moli\u00e8re productions, an array of quirky little cinemas and, of course, the Mona Lisa smirking mysteriously in the Louvre. </p> <p>It all adds up to a spectacular- if predictable- testament to the artistic glories of France's past- but what, ask the critics, of the present? Or the future? </p> <p>This week the answer may just have come in the unlikely form of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/08/france.art\">Centquatre</a>, a former funeral parlour in one of the capital's grittiest neighbourhoods. The complex has been entirely renovated to create what its directors are calling Europe's largest artists' residency. </p> <p>Sculptors, designers, painters, comic strip writers, musicians, dancers and even gardeners are all welcome to work and exhibit in a 29,000 square metres space devoted entirely to cutting edge contemporary art. The only catch? They must be prepared for curious members of the public to enter their sanctum and watch them at work. </p> <p>Here are 10 of the highlights from Paris's most unexpected artistic treasure.</p> <h2>1. 104, rue d'Aubervilliers</h2> <p>First thing's first: the Centquatre is worth a visit if only to gaze in wonder at the renovated shell of the former pompes fun\u00e8bres - once the hub of Paris's death industry. Now the building, inaugurated in 1874 with a sombreness that befitted its function, is vast and airy with a glass ceiling that lets the light flood in. Lining either side are the new artists' studios which, as of this weekend will be occupied by their new residents. Go and learn from the masters.</p> <h2>2. Tricky</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338402479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/08/tricky4.jpg\" alt=\"Tricky\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tricky gives a free gig this weekend</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you can make it to Centquatre this Saturday, an all-day, all-night launch party is set to razzle dazzle the public with its myriad cultural offerings. Make a point of sticking around until 9pm for a free concert given by the Bristol-born trip-hop legend. Adrian Thaws, otherwise known as Tricky, is one of the most marketable names among Centquatre's artists in residence. At the launch he'll be performing tracks from his new album, Knowle West Boy.</p> <h2>3. Nicolas Simarik</h2> <p>This French artist has the key. To what, he doesn't really care, as long as it has a good story behind it. Maybe he even has your key, if you trust him with it. Having spent months setting up his studio as a kind of unofficial locksmith's, Simarik has learned for himself how to duplicate keys and is planning to collect as many as possible from secret corners all over Paris before symbolically 'returning' them to the city by setting them in slabs of stone on the pavement. </p> <h2>4. School of Design</h2> <p>We've had wannabe singers, wannabe celebrities, wannabe chefs: now we've got wannabe designers coming to a screen near you. The BBC is currently filming its latest reality TV series in the until-now-closeted confines of Centquatre. From this Saturday, however, you'll be able to catch a glimpse of the youngsters trying to dream up the must-have products of the 21st century. Who knows? You might even bump into the man they have to impress - he of the stylised toothbrushes and Bubble Club sofa, <a href=\"http://www.philippe-starck.com/\">Philippe Starck</a>.</p> <h2>5. Memory Room</h2> <p>One of the striking things about Centquatre is that, despite its macabre past, there is nothing eerie or sinister about it. It's hard to imagine coffins being pushed down corridors that are now neon-lit, or bodies being rushed in to rooms now decorated with bright colours and bold designs. To get an idea of what it used to be like, visit the Memory Room, where black-and-white film clips show lace-bedded coffins being made up and horses-drawn hearses emerging solemnly from the gates.</p> <h2>6. Tania Bruguera</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.taniabruguera.com/info_cv.html\">Bruguera</a> was the woman who dressed up actors as policemen on horseback and sent them into the Tate Modern to control the crowds. Just as her performance then revolved around questions of authority, power, and the powerless, so too her work at Centquatre is a highly political exploration of what it means to be a migrant in a globalised society. Using her Paris atelier as the birthplace of a new movement, the Migrant People's Party, the Cuban artist will hold a series of workshops and performances in which art and politics come together.</p> <h2>7. Centquatre restaurant</h2> <p>The area around Centquatre is nothing if not mixed. The directors reckon there are over 30 different communities living in the neighbourhood's bleak social housing blocks - and that this vibrant cultural heritage is all too often overlooked by headlines screaming gang warfare and soaring crime. As of February, a restaurant reflecting this colourful international character will open, using recipes from each of the communities as dish of the day. Deliberately affordable prices will start at around \u20ac8. </p> <h2>8. Anri Sala</h2> <p>Did you know that swallows migrate when the temperature falls to 10C (50F)? Or that, during 1991's coup in Moscow, the thermometer inside the Mir space station measured 19C (66F)? Do you even care? If so, Albanian artist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anri_Sala\">Anri Sala</a>'s workshop might just be for you. His studio is devoted to the relationship between atmosphere and events. For every degree between -12 and 45C he has chosen a film; every time the weather outside goes up or down a notch, the movie being projected onto the walls changes. </p> <h2>9. Maison des petits</h2> <p>Those shapes! Those colours! Those perfectly crafted fingers! If you are fairly sure that your child will be the 21st-century reincarnation of Leonardo or Picasso, at Centquatre you have the chance to set him or her on the path to artistic stardom. Maybe. The House of Children is staffed by trained adults who encourage toddlers under five to be creative with objects around them and is set to open in February. Specially designed for youngsters- it's all plastic furniture, curved edges and bright colours- there's plenty of nourishment for precocious talent. </p> <h2>10. Atelier le Balto</h2> <p>Each year a different landscape gardener will take control of a green space in the centre of Centquatre and transform it according to their personal tastes. First off is the turn of a Berlin-based group who felt the light and indoor temperature was perfect for hanging gardens. The fruit and vegetable seeds will be chosen by a group of people who will return in couples every month to contribute their own mini-vision to the space as a whole. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.104.fr/fr\">Centquatre</a>, 104 rue d'Aubervilliers, +33 (0)1 40 05 51 71, opens its wrought iron gates from 11am to 11pm every day, and entry costs \u20ac5 (\u20ac3 concessions).

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> New York.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Iddo Arad (synths, vocals), Ben Brantley (bass), Jorge Elbrecht (lead vocals, guitar), Kris King (drums). </p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> There are bad New Bands, there are promising ones, there are even a few great ones. And then there are those who you just know are going to dominate the scene for the next few months at least. Many of the agenda-setting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/newbandoftheday\">new bands</a> we've praised in this column over the last year have been American - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/11/popandrock1\">Fleet Foxes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/09/popandrock3\">MGMT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/26/popandrock2\">Black Kids</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/28/boy.crisis\">Boy Crisis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/22/hockey\">Hockey</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/26/amazing.baby\">Amazing Baby</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/03/new.band.of.the.day.382.chairlift\">Chairlift</a> - which somewhat makes a mockery of, or renders redundant, the notion of British-only music awards like the Brits and the Mercury Prize. How can geography be a criterion when you're measuring musical worth?</p> <p>Violens, to be geographically precise, belong in the pantheon of Great New New York Bands. They only formed last winter, but already they're responsible for some highly accomplished and beautifully realised music, with the emphasis on the \"beautiful\". We say that because we assumed from their name (pronounced <em>vy-lenz</em>) that they were going to be some sort of sub-Sonic Youth art-drone collective, when actually their breezy psychedelia recalls the late-60s sunshine-pop heyday of The Zombies, The Left Banke and their ilk, only with a shiny 80s production. Some of it really is rather lovely, but then if you see their name as a conflation of \"violence\" and \"violins\" it makes sense, and suits these lushly orchestrated songs about nightmares, the passage of time, speculations on spiritual messages and accounts of drug-induced hallucinations.</p> <p>They've got a track called Doomed, which again we feared from the title was going to be goth-by-numbers when actually it's as light and airy as a 1968 hit by the Association or the Fifth Dimension, even if the ba-ba-ba's and harmonies are almost creepily immaculate. Already Over is just as good, all softly strummed guitar - Johnny Marr at his most blissfully Roger McGuinn-like - and gorgeous aah-aahs, like some spacey 21st century Beach Boys.</p> <p>Fans of The Shins and any of the Elephant 6 outfits like Olivia Tremor Control or Neutral Milk Hotel will be in raptures. They do make strange detours - Trance Like Turn sounds like postpunk avant-minimalists Wire on those few occasions when they evoked The Byrds - but you can imagine them working within the context of an album of latter-day baroque pop. Take, for example, the martial, pounding symphonic rock of March IV Violent Sensation Descends, which is like something Flaming Lips' Steven Drozd might have knocked up in his sleep for a B-side of one of the singles off The Soft Bulletin. It would make a strong album opener, not that we're telling them what to do.</p> <p>We should mention MGMT, although we know the other Brooklyn bands are nervous about being seen as riding on their coattails. Nevertheless, the facts remain: Violens' lead singer, guitarist and producer Jorge Elbrecht recently remixed MGMT's single Time To Pretend; the band's debut performance was at NYC's Bowery Ballroom supporting MGMT and Yeasayer; next month they will play their first ever UK shows as main support for MGMT, following a special Halloween party with Brooklyn's best up-and-coming acts, including Chairlift and, yup, MGMT.</p> <p>But then, if they can produce a whole album as good as Doomed, Trance Like Turn and Already Over, it's MGMT who will be following in Violens' slipstream.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Ever wondered what The Shins might sound like if they'd ever taken an enormous amount of happy drugs with Arthur Lee, Jim Morrison and the rest of the '60s West Coast Elektra set?\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Another fine new New York band. Sorry. We promise to bring you a crap one at some point.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Use violins.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Be violent.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Violens EP is released by Deadly Records on November 10.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> The Zombies, MGMT, the Byrds, Curt Boettcher.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/violensmusic\">MySpace.com/violensmusic</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Filthy Dukes.</p>",
  "<p>Britain will suffer its first full year of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a> since 1991 next year as the global economy enters a \"major downturn\" triggered by the most dangerous financial shock since the 1930s, the IMF said today.</p> <p>In a sombre half-yearly health-check of the international economy, the International Monetary Fund slashed its growth forecasts for the UK for 2009 from 1.7% to -0.1% \u2013 more sharply than for any other major economy.</p> <p>The IMF said the risk was that the recession in the UK would be even deeper than it is currently forecasting.</p> <p>Overall, the IMF said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">world economy</a> would grow by just 3% in 2009, largely due to the strength of the two big developing Asian economies, China and India, which are forecast to expand by 9.3% and 6.9% respectively.</p> <p>\"The major advanced economies are already in, or close to recession, and although a recovery is projected in 2009, the pickup is likely to be unusually gradual, held back by continued financial market deleveraging,\" the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook, released as finance ministers from around the world prepare to gather in Washington this weekend to discuss the crisis.</p> <p>\"The financial crisis that first erupted with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">US sub-prime mortgage collapse</a> in 2007 has deepened further in the past six months, and entered a tumultuous new phase in September,\" the fund warned.</p> <p>\"The impact has been felt across the global financial system, including in emerging markets to an increasing extent. Intensifying solvency concerns have led to emergency resolutions of major US and European financial institutions, and have badly shaken confidence.\"</p> <p>Of the developed economies, the US is expected to flirt with an outright recession in 2009, growing by a sickly 0.1%, while the world's second-biggest economy, Japan, should see 0.5% growth, with Germany stagnating, the fund said.</p> <p>The fund singled out the UK, together with Ireland and Spain, as especially vulnerable to a housing market crash, saying it has experienced a larger \"unexplained\" increase in house prices over the past decade. It added that the Treasury is entering the downturn with the public finances in a weaker state than at the time of the dotcom collapse, leaving Alistair Darling less scope to use fiscal policy to prop up the economy.</p> <p>Analysing the causes of the financial crisis, the fund said \"lax macroeconomic and regulatory policies\" had allowed the world economy to grow faster than its \"speed limit\", for several years, allowing bubbles to build up in stockmarkets, house prices and commodities.</p> <p>It called for central banks to be allowed to take into account the risk of financial instability in their monetary policy decisions, and lean against the wind\" to prevent unsustainable booms from emerging in future.</p>",
  "<p>The British government has announced a \u00a350bn part-nationalisation scheme. As someone who has been calling for the nationalisation of the banking sector since this crisis began, I should be satisfied.</p> <p>However, as more details of this package emerge <a href=\"http://leap-lrc.blogspot.com/\">left economists</a> and Labour MPs are increasingly alarmed. The deal is incredibly reckless: the government will only take preference shares in the banks in exchange for a massive investment of taxpayers' cash. The only potential advantage for taxpayers is in dividend payments, if there are any, crucially though the government will have no controlling stake. This in effect is handing over taxpayers' money to the very people who led these banks to the brink of collapse. </p> <p>If the government is injecting public money, it should also take the right to oversee board appointments, executive pay, and future business operations. The government argues that by taking preference shares, the taxpayer will have first call on dividends. However, the only banks that will come forward to use this \u00a350bn facility will be those in trouble. The market capitalisation of these banks has only been sustained at all by the prospect of a government bail out. Many of these banks are actually bust. Therefore there will be no dividends, we are throwing good public money after bad.</p> <p>The government should be ensuring the public is protected through cuts in consumer borrowing rates \u2013 ensuring that people do not default on their debt and mortgage payments; giving a no-repossession guarantee, providing people with a \"right to stay\" in their homes \u2013 by converting repossessions to social rentals; and securing the jobs of those workers now threatened with redundancy as their bosses' kamikaze capitalism unravels.</p> <p>But to do that, we would have to take a controlling stake. We should have nationalised to stabilise, with control for the taxpayer to have scrutiny of the banks' accounts, representation on the boards, a pay cap for bank directors and the end of excessive bonuses.</p> <p>This may prop up a failing system in the short term, but in the medium to long term this deal will have to be paid for and this can only come through either tax rises or (more likely) through public expenditure cuts. This will exacerbate the recession by reducing demand. So while the package might prop up the banks in the short term, it risks further damaging the entire economy in the long term. </p> <p>This deal is like your neighbour going on a massive spending binge \u2013 throwing a party, buying a new car, going on holiday \u2013 and then sending you the bill. Taxpayers will end up paying doubly, once through loose subsidies to dodgy banks and the second time as the recession bites and they risk losing their jobs, homes and going further into debt.</p> <p>At that point they will rightly be asking the government: \"Where is the bailout for the British public?\"</p>",

  "<p>There was a moment on the radio this morning when a BBC reporter asked John Cridland, No 2 at the CBI how well he thought the government had done. </p> <p>\"I can't criticise the government. The pace of events...\" replied Cridland. \"You think the government has done a good job?\" interrupted the reporter, a touch incredulous. </p> <p>Cridland, whose organisation was on the saner side of free market argument in the Thatcher heyday, said the CBI is \"very grateful\" for government support. </p> <p>That's nice because we're all going to have to pay for it one way or another - and it will be a long time before anyone can know whether the remedy has worked to restore confidence in financial markets and beyond.</p> <p>But everyone wants instant answers. \"Banks furious as government dithers\" were headlines in yesterday's papers, this because Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling hadn't come up with the rescue package for the banks which they explicitly said - at the weekend and on Monday - they weren't yet ready to produce. Having listened to officials this morning, explaining the grinding technicalities after being up all night I have some sympathy.</p> <p>Yet , just as today's Daily Mail leads on \"Banks to fall under state control\" - sinister or what? - we heard John Humphrys, the Mail's broadcasting favourite, cajoling Darling on the Today programme about his apparent refusal to take more control of the banks to protect the taxpayers' interests.</p> <p>You just can't win. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, damned if you hurry - like Hank Paulson in the US - damned if you sew up the details - as Darling has tried to do - rather than go off at half-cock.</p> <p>Before addressing MPs at lunchtime the chancellor refused to answer questions he didn't want to answer - quite right too in tricky times when casual words can tumble markets, though it transpires that each negotiation with each bank will be different, depending what they ask for and what assurances - executive pay, share status etc - Whitehall seeks to protect the taxpayer.</p> <p>That all seems reasonable to me. Indeed at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/oct/08/pmqs.gordonbrown\">PM's question time</a> - a rare win in straight sets for Brown - David Cameron and Nick Clegg were falling over themselves to ask largely redundant questions about the need to look after small businesses and mortgage victims, not the bonuses of investment bankers who have failed us all. </p> <p>Easy, populist stuff from Cameron and George Osborne, who were singing more of a John McCain tune a few days ago.</p> <p>But what about that earlier \"banks furious\"? Where did all that stuff come from? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/economy.gordonbrown\">Patrick Wintour sets out some of the background in today's Guardian</a>, not least the pressure on Downing Street after City leaks helped push down bank shares and the FTSE in general - though it was part of a global decline on Monday and Tuesday. It seems to have emerged from weekend briefings and meetings between interested parties.</p> <p>Brown blames the Tories for leaking confidential briefings for party advantage. That may or may not be the case. But what triggered Tuesday's market panic was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/ \">Robert Peston's BBC blog</a>, revealing a Monday night meeting where the \"gang of three\" - Barclays, RBS and Lloyds TSB - told Darling to pull his finger out and rescue them fast. </p> <p>That could be a case of briefing against government to increase political pressure, something the City is good at doing against ministers and against commercial rivals. </p> <p>There again, if other banks - less pressed - were present they could have leaked it to damage the gang of three. Who can say? Peston, who is a very good news reporter, has been scaring me for months. \"He behaves like a print journalist,\" complains a tabloid colleague. </p> <p>Exactly, but the BBC is not a tabloid and the impact of its bulletins - and blogs - is exponential in a febrile public mood where City rumours easily go mad. </p> <p>The BBC bureaucracy is hopeless - think Andrew Gilligan - at managing the output of talented and energetic mavericks. </p> <p>The Mail is now on Robert Peston's case, so the suits may finally notice. Yet the temptation is always to hit the easy target - governments. Even so sophisticated a conservative commentator as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/economy.alistairdarling\">Simon Jenkins falls into this trap today</a>.</p> <p>So repeat after me: the bankers took the bumpers and the airbags out of the car to make it go faster. They then took it for a spin after a good lunch, drove too fast round some wet corners and crashed. They're in the wreckage screaming for help and blaming the fire brigade for not cutting them out sooner. They know the petrol tank may blow at any moment. In that situation it might be wise to extinguish that comforting cigar.</p>",
  "<p>When I was growing up it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-a-jqgiNpI\">Bob Holness</a> and <a href=\"http://www.radioacademy.org.uk/record.jsp?type=celeb&amp;ID=8\">Douglas Cameron</a>. Then came the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/04/radio.broadcasting\">Michael Parkinson and Angela Rippon</a>, and now its star presenters include an ex-London mayor and two former contestants on the Apprentice. Welcome to London talk station LBC, <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/\">35 years old today</a>. </p> <p>I was something on an LBC addict in my youth. Holness and Cameron on breakfast, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hayes_(broadcaster)\">Brian Hayes'</a> essential morning show and the all-important late-night phones which sent me gently to sleep. And before you ask, no, I wasn't overburdened with friends at that time. </p> <p>The Sunday night mystery voice competition was particularly exciting, hosted \u2013 unless my memory is playing tricks on me \u2013 by one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/30/television.itv\">Jeremy Beadle</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-812825-details/Where+it+all+went+wrong+for+LBC/article.do\">But then it all went horribly wrong.</a> In 1989 its then owner, Crown Communications, had the bright idea of splitting the station in two \u2013 Crown FM and London Talkback.</p> <p>Crown FM was deeply boring \u2013 no jingles, no phone-ins, no fun \u2013 while London Talkback did what it said on the tin \u2013 phone-in, after phone-in, after phone-in. A bit like BBC Radio 5 Live today. I jest, of course.</p> <p>But it didn't have enough talent \u2013 or money, probably \u2013 to go round, and I retuned to Capital. One of London's great brands had been lost for good.</p> <p>Attempts to revive it with big name signings like Parky just didn't work. The venerable chatshow host sounded a lot more comfy talking to big name stars than he did Dave from Dagenham or John from <a href=\"http://www.bexley.gov.uk/\">Bexley</a>. </p> <p>I remember one time a chap started talking about dirty toilet bowls. Parkinson sounded appalled.</p> <p>I never did get on air. The only time I correctly guessed Beadle's mystery voice, the phone was permanently engaged. I have no doubt, in the light of recent events, that it was all entirely above board. </p> <p>A long list of relaunches and ownership changes followed, with its then largest shareholder ITN taking editorial control of both stations in 1999. Two years later, with the station still split in two, the services were swapped, with the more popular station given the superior FM berth, and the news service saddled with AM.</p> <p>In the latest official listening figures for the second quarter of this year, it had a total UK audience of 845,000 listeners, with 597,000 people tuning into LBC 97.3 \u2013 a 2.7% share of the audience \u2013 and 291,000 listening to LBC News 1152.</p> <p>The phone-in station, renowned as the favourite of London cab drivers everywhere, is up on five years ago, when it had 517,000 listeners, but the news service is down from 444,000. </p> <p>Some of the old voices I used to listen to are still there under its current owner <a href=\"http://www.thisisglobal.com/radio/\">Global Radio</a> \u2013 Steve Allen, Clive Bull \u2013 along with breakfast host Nick Ferrari and the likes of James O'Brien, Ken Livingstone, James Whale and former Apprentice contestants James Max and Tre Azam.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/page-3411\">It is a curious mix</a>, along with one-off events such as the University Boat Race, poached from BBC Radio along with commentator Barry Davies. </p> <p>If you liked Holness and Cameron at breakfast then you probably won't like Ferrari \u2013 I don't \u2013 and I only tune in very rarely these days. Do you? I would also like to hear your favourite LBC memories. After 35 years, there are certainly plenty to choose from.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes I wonder if Kevin Smith is wasted behind the cameras.

  "<p>The response to today's announcement of a long-awaited bail-out package for the UK banking sector has been broadly positive, with some in the City talking of a \"new era for banking\". There were also fresh calls for a reduction in interest rates from the Bank of England tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Germany's deputy finance minister</strong>, <strong>Joerg Asmussen</strong>, said: \"We welcome this approach from the British government because it contributes to the stability of the British financial system and we know what importance that has for the European financial system.\"</p> <p><strong>Vince Cable</strong>, the <strong>Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman</strong>, broadly welcomed the package but was concerned at how long it took to be announced. \"The last 48 hours have been a mess,\" he said, adding that an announcement on Monday would have prevented \"an enormous amount of money [being] wiped off share values\". He said the government needed to find out where the leaks came from.</p> <p>\"No one has any guarantee that this will work,\" he cautioned. The nearest precedent was in the Nordic countries in the early 90s where it did work, \"but this is a much bigger crisis\". \"This is only part of what is required, not all of it,\" he said, calling for an interest rate cut from the Bank of England at the end of its two-day meeting tomorrow.</p> <p>Cable thought a run on Britain's banks had been averted. \"I don't think there is any evidence of retail depositors fleeing banks, which would be a disaster,\" he said. </p> <p>But he added: \"There are bits of the British economy which are really feeling the pain already... Housebuilding companies are in big difficulty, and a lot of people are struggling with their mortgage payments.\" He said the government now needs to address issues affecting households like repossession.</p> <p><strong>John Cridland</strong>, the <strong>CBI deputy director general</strong>, welcomed \"today's essential measures which strengthen the British banking system, and will help provide financial stability for the country.\" </p> <p>He added: \"British business is facing a freezing of bank finance. Many companies need this action to keep investment and working capital flowing. This step to build confidence in the City needs to be followed tomorrow by a half-point cut in interest rates to boost consumer confidence.\"</p> <p><strong>John Wright</strong>, chairman of the <strong>Federation of Small Businesses</strong>, said: \"This is an ideal opportunity now that the government has a big stake in the banks to enter into a constructive dialogue with them about their commercial practices and their charges regarding small businesses. Almost half of our members have seen an increase in the cost of finance over the last year. It is crucial in these tough times that small businesses have access to fair overdraft and loan rates. Today's announcement should be coupled with assurances that more money will be made available to small businesses to help sustain them and get them through the next year.\" </p> <p><strong>Michael Coogan</strong>, director general of the <strong>Council of Mortgage Lenders</strong>, said: \"From what we can see so far, this seems to be a decisive, coordinated and reasonable package of measures that address both the relevant factors necessary to support a return to market stability. The flow of funding to support mortgage lending has been severely constrained, and these measures will help to create more positive conditions for the mortgage market.\"</p> <p><strong>Adrian Coles</strong>, director general of the <strong>Building Societies Association</strong>, was happy to see that all building societies are fully eligible - if they wish - for the package of financial support. \"Societies have strong balance sheets, are well capitalised, have high levels of liquidity and have experienced record savings inflows over the past year, but it is good that societies are not excluded from this package. Societies' inclusion will give them maximum flexibility to react to the extraordinary events now occurring in the markets,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Derek Simpson</strong>, joint leader of the <strong>Unite union</strong>, welcomed the bail-out, but added: \"The union is demanding that this financial support is tied to clear commitments to secure vital jobs in the financial services sector. The government finance must serve to make the industry more transparent and accountable.\" </p> <p>He said today's measures should be extended to include pledges by the banks of no job losses, no repossessions of homes and no rewards for \"failure\". He added: \"It is imperative that the financial measures announced today mark the turning point in the world of banking and finance. Workers in the financial services industry are not the culprits of the credit crunch and we are not prepared to allow them to become the victims.\"</p> <p><strong>David Kern</strong>, economic adviser to the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, welcomed the \"radical measures\" announced by the government. \"We hope the package will restore stability,\" he added. </p> <p>\"But given the erratic mood in the financial markets, there remains a risk of renewed speculative attacks. In the current situation, the authorities must not be taken by surprise. If the need arises, they must have additional instruments at their disposal.</p> <p>\"The financial turmoil must not be allowed to damage the real economy. It is critically important to restore confidence. The vital flow of finance to businesses and consumers must be maintained at all costs. A cut in interest rates tomorrow, and a reduction in business taxes, remain vital steps.\"</p> <p><strong>Robert Jenkins</strong>, chairman of the <strong>Investment Management Association</strong>, said: \"There is a liquidity problem, a bank solvency problem and a confidence problem. These measures are positive for interbank liquidity and a necessary step towards much needed bank recapitalisation. Whether or not the sums involved are sufficient, hinges on the extent to which the banks have accurately valued their assets. This uncertainty needs to be addressed fully to restore confidence. We would also expect the banks to consult with their long term institutional shareholders as to the terms of the arrangements they will be entering with the government.\"</p> <p><strong>Roger Lawson</strong>, of the <strong>UK Shareholders Association</strong>, welcomed the government proposals to improve the capitalisation and liquidity of the banking sector. \"Providing preference share capital on appropriate terms, or even equity finance, if this would assist banks is likely to be of benefit to everyone, including the bank's shareholders.</p> <p>\"However the suggestion that the government will enforce reductions in dividends, or even total suspension which has been suggested in some press reports, will dismay many of our members who rely on such dividends for their retirement income. Similarly the general public will suffer a major reduction in their pension benefits in many cases if the dividend income to institutional pension funds was restricted. </p> <p>\"To disturb the normal relationship between investors and companies by dictatorial policies on dividends by the government or other interference in their normal affairs would be of great concern, although clearly if there is a normal commercial negotiation on the terms attached to the provision of preference share capital then that would be a different matter. The consideration of what is a prudent dividend policy going forward should be something primarily for the companies and their boards to decide, and they should not be forced to take on additional capital on terms with which they may not be happy,\" Lawson said.</p> <p><strong>Paul Niven</strong>, head of asset allocation at <strong>F&amp;C</strong>, said: \"It is too soon to make strong conclusions over the long-term impact of the move on the banks themselves but, in our view, we have now entered a new era for global banking. In return for taxpayers' money. the state will gain a level of control over their governance, pay, and lending practices. Regulation will increase markedly and controls on all elements of banking practices will rise.</p> <p>\"While the moves by the UK have to be viewed positively, and a step in the right direction, we are still seeing piecemeal actions by governments to address their domestic issues. For these individual actions to be effective we need much more from countries which have done little, as yet, to directly address the issue of bank recapitalisation, arguably including the US. The UK has set out a model which shows the banks having to bow to the State in terms of national versus shareholder interest. The new model for capitalism has been set out.\"</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Alex Potter</strong>, banking analyst at <strong>Collins Stewart</strong>, said: \"Government finally comes up with a viable bank rescue plan. Having procrastinated for far too long, the UK government has finally reacted to the actions of, inter alia, the Irish, Danes, Swedes and Germans and instituted a bank rescue/stability plan.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This plan should work - but will materially impact dividends. We feel that the wholesale funding plan is key to short-term stability and that the capital raisings should stabilise banks further out. As such, we anticipate some short-run price recovery. </p> <p>\"However, the government is insisting on tighter control of capital, dividends and executive pay. We feel that dividend payouts for the main four UK domestic banks will be severely impacted with the possibility of no cash payout until 2010 or later. HSBC and Standard Chartered will participate but, we believe, mainly to remove the stigma of participation \u2013 we see little/no dividend impact for these two banks. HBOS has most to gain from such funding guarantees,\" Potter said.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Loynes</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, said: \"The moves are clearly welcome and go rather further than press reports had suggested. But there are good reasons why they are unlikely to prevent a sharp contraction in the growth of bank lending from contributing to a major downturn in the UK economy. </p> <p>\"Meanwhile, there are clear concerns over the fiscal implications. If \u2013 and this is not yet clear \u2013 the \u00a350bn adds directly to public borrowing, this would push borrowing above \u00a3100bn a year, perhaps rising to \u00a3150bn in two years, or higher as the full effects of the economic downturn are felt. Needless to say, this prospect could put some upward pressure on long\u2013term bond yields. Nonetheless, with the plans not likely to relieve the need for very aggressive cuts in interest rates \u2013 we now expect rates to fall to 2.5% or below \u2013 the pressure on market interest rate expectations and short-term bond yields will remain strongly downwards.\"</p> <p><strong>Richard Cantor</strong>, <strong>Moody's</strong> chief credit officer, said government support of liquidity-constrained banks is playing a \"very supportive role\" for the banking sector and its ratings, but the extension of support has not resulted in upgrades \u2013 and in some cases has not precluded downgrades \u2013 of the affected banks. In a new report, he said that Moody's will \"continue to take rating actions on those banks whose long-run financial strengths no longer appear consistent with their current ratings, but it is not undertaking systematic downgrades across the banking sector.\" </p> <p>The <strong>Charles Stanley</strong> analyst, <strong>Jeremy Batstone-Carr</strong>, described the package as a \"truly historic\" moment which requires a \"quid pro quo\" for taxpayers, in return for the funding bail-out. \"Taxpayers are going to have stakes in clearing banks and we are going to have some say in how the banks are run and the remuneration of senior executives.\" </p> <p>Banks will be precluded from the extravagant lending practices of the past with profits lower but businesses more stable, he said. \"This is utterly extraordinary. We are talking about a gigantic sum of money,\" he added.</p> <p>Leftwing <strong>Labour MP John McDonnell</strong> said: \"Without full nationalisation the government is effectively nationalising the banks' losses and privatising the profits so that taxpayers will now pay for this crisis caused by the greed of the bankers.\"</p> <p><strong>Guardian and Observer</strong> commentator <strong>Will Hutton</strong> said: \"This will make the British, who were the weakest part of the international chain, the strongest part of the international chain.\" But he warned: \"This is the battle won, but not the war over. There are toxic debts on the British banks' balance sheets and these have to be taken off.\"</p>",

  "<p>Every doping sample taken at Beijing 2008 will be retested by the International Olympic Committee to check for traces of the newly-discovered blood-boosting drug CERA (Continuous Erythropoiesis Receptor Activator).</p> <p>The IOC conducted more than 5,000 doping tests during this year's Games, and the spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau confirmed today that every sample would be re-examined by the World Anti-Doping Agency's laboratory in Lausanne. The decision to test for CERA, an advanced version of the endurance-enhancing hormone EPO, was taken after the drug was detected in Tour de France samples that had previously been passed as clean. </p> <p>Doping officials are still retesting samples from this year's Tour de France, and further positive results are expected. \"I imagine there could be one or two more cases,\" suggested the race director Christian Prudhomme after officials confirmed yesterday that Germany's Stefan Schumacher and Italy's Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, who won five of the Tour's 21 stages between them, had tested positive for CERA.</p> <p>The IOC vice-president Thomas Bach told reporters yesterday that road cycling could lose its status as an Olympic sport altogether if the recent spate of positive tests continued. Moreau was more conciliatory today, stating that: \"The IOC will continue to support the International Cycling Union and any other international federation as long as it is deploying meaningful and credible means and efforts to fight against doping.\"</p> <p>Six athletes were disqualified for doping during the Beijing Games and three more cases are pending.</p>",
  "<p>On September 18 drug campaign group Release held its annual conference in London. To thunderous applause, drug policy reformer and racial equality advocate Deborah Small gave a harrowing account of the plight of her fellow black Americans whose lives are caught up in the vicious interplay of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugsandalcohol\">drugs</a> and race wars being waged by US authorities. </p> <p>\"People say the drug war isn't working,\" she opines, \"but not me - I say it is working, only too well. It's a highly successful method of maintaining the oppression of black people in the United States.\"</p> <p>Small points to the disparities in sentencing for cocaine offences as evidence of her claims. When Congress enacted its mandatory minimum sentencing legislation, it singled out crack cocaine for especially harsh treatment; whereas possession of only 5g of crack brings a mandatory five year prison term, it takes 500g of cocaine powder to draw the equivalent. On the US drug scene, cocaine powder is the drug of choice for affluent whites, while crack is associated with urban black society. As a result, the burden of these policies has fallen overwhelmingly on African Americans. These are poor, low-level offenders, and becoming enmeshed in the criminal justice system leads them and their communities inexorably into a cycle of imprisonment, unemployment, one-parent families, political disenfranchisement, poverty and crime. </p> <p>\"The war on drugs is the continuation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">Jim Crow</a> by another name,\" Small says. A long-time activist and impassioned speaker, her reference to Jim Crow evokes the bitterness of the black experience of post-civil war America, when the former Confederate southern states enacted a raft of laws named after a minstrel with blackened face whose performance mocked a stereotyped figure of the African American male. The Jim Crow laws replaced slavery with a new regime in which segregation and disenfranchisement underpinned an informal culture of brutality and lynching. Despite the promise of emancipation, once again African Americans were down by law.</p> <p>According to Small, they still are. \"When the civil rights movement succeeded in dismantling Jim Crow, the drug war took over the work of discrimination.\"</p> <p>Contemporary African Americans are three times as likely to be arrested and 10 times as likely to receive a prison sentence as white Americans. The data is stark and shocking\u2014but how does it compare with the UK? It was this intriguing question that Alex Stevens of Kent University set out to answer in his presentation as he followed Small onto the stage. She was quite an act to follow, but Stevens managed it, mainly by letting the data do the talking.</p> <p>Those on the liberal left of British politics tend to adopt a self-congratulatory tone in respect to the shameful inequalities of US drug laws and policies. The hard lesson the audience learned was the UK does not, by contrast, stand out as a shining beacon of racial equality. Instead, we heard for drug offences, black Britons are around eight times more likely to be arrested and 10 times more likely to be sent to prison than their white fellow citizens. Arguing against the possible explanation the differentials simply reflect greater drug use by black people, Stevens examined further academic research showing whites and blacks use drugs in about the same percentages and, in the case of Class A drugs, a rather greater percentage of whites use them. </p> <p>In his discussion, Stevens pointed to a number of factors which might explain the disparities. One was the greater availability of black people in the street, as they are almost five times more likely to be homeless, and nearly three times more likely to be unemployed or excluded from school. </p> <p>He also stressed the need to take into account broader questions of power and inequality in understanding the data, and it was in this analysis that he began to tread the same sort of terrain as Small. The police tend to target areas of socio-economic deprivation, and these are the areas into which black Britons have been herded by poverty and marginalisation. </p> <p>The poor and black are crucially lacking in what sociologists call \"cultural capital\"\u2014they don't have the right accents, they lack powerful connections, lawyers, the credit cards that bespeak respectability, and so on\u2014and this makes them easy targets. By contrast, Stevens invited us to recall the recent affair of Eva Rausing, wife of the Swedish billionaire's son, who was caught smuggling heroin and cocaine into the US embassy. Her husband Hans was subsequently arrested too, when allegedly a large stash of Class A drugs was found at his Chelsea home. Both were given conditional cautions.</p> <p>Such high profile cases stand in sharp relief against a background in which black Britons are routinely directed into our burgeoning prison system. They should remind us of the massive inequalities in power and wealth which structure our society and underlie the disparities in the criminal justice system, not only across the Atlantic but here, in the daily grind of Britain's own perhaps less brash but equally injurious war on drugs. </p> <p>Sebastian Saville is executive director of Release</p>",
  "<p>Tackling violent extremism is not a new challenge for this country. When I was at school there was the seemingly ever-present threat from terrorists, starkly illustrated on our TV screens with scenes of bombings in Birmingham and Guildford. And in history lessons up and down the country, children still learn about the actions of Guy Fawkes and his November plot to blow up Parliament.</p> <p>But as times change the threat evolves. The principal cause for security concerns today come from groups linked to al-Qaida, who use an ideology that twists the teachings of a peaceful religion into a justification for extreme violence. Meanwhile other forms of extremism and racial or hate-driven prejudice are sowing divisions in our communities and causing alienation among a small minority of young people.</p> <p>We have learnt from past experience that a security response is not enough. We need to address the underlying issues that can drive people into the hands of violent extremist groups and encourage local communities to come together to expose the flaws in extremists' arguments, to reject cruelty and violence and promote core British values of tolerance, liberty, fairness and the rule of law.</p> <p>Young people are already very much alive to these problems and are keen for the opportunity to express their views and air their concerns. A recent report by the UK Youth Parliament showed 94% of young people think schools are the best environment to discuss preventing terrorism and violent extremism. </p> <p>That is why I am publishing <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/publications/violentextremism/toolkitforschools\">a toolkit for schools</a> to help them contribute to the prevention of violent extremism. It shows how schools can help pupils of all ages to develop the knowledge and skills to challenge and debate, through programmes such as Seal in primary schools and Citizenship in secondary schools, and encourages an ethos which promotes respect and engagement with the wider community around the school.</p> <p>I have spent the last few months discussing the challenges of preventing violent extremism with young people, teachers and other professionals across the country. I have been struck by the commitment and engagement from all communities to come together to challenge those who seek to undermine the principles of respect and tolerance on which our society is based. </p> <p>A small minority of schools have had to deal with the consequences of pupils or former pupils being caught up with criminal activity linked to extremist views, or of their local communities being affected by violent extremist activities. This must be one of the most challenging issues a teacher will come across and requires great professionalism and sensitivity. </p> <p>This is not about teachers monitoring pupils. Instead the toolkit responds to feedback from teachers and others on the need for more practical advice on how to support vulnerable pupils, working alongside other local partners and community organisations. It contains case studies such as a programme with Muslims in Oxford which equips pupils with arguments against a violent extremist ideology and helps to develop the foundation of a British-Islamic identity.</p> <p>And because a local partnership approach, tailored to the needs of particular communities, is so important, I am providing funding to all local authorities so they can lead in providing local information to go alongside the toolkit to support schools in this work. </p> <p>The toolkit shows how schools can build on work they are already doing. For example from this year Ofsted will begin to inspect schools on their duty to promote community cohesion; and since a trial in Bradford, many schools are now engaged in school linking projects which see children from different cultures, religions and backgrounds coming together to work together on joint projects. This kind of cooperative spirit can help break down the barriers between different groups that can lead to mistrust.</p> <p>I am constantly impressed by our nation's young people. They give me great hope for Britain's future. Yesterday the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, and I met the new Young Muslims' Advisory Group. They displayed all the intelligence, maturity and insight that young people are all too rarely credited with. They also displayed a refreshing lack of cynicism. But they made the point that many young people do have genuine grievances that need to be aired \u2013 rather than allowed to fester. </p> <p>They represented all that is best about multi-cultural Britain based on our core values: engagement with the community, wider society and politics; an ability to discuss controversial issues without resort to polarised rhetoric; an interest and acceptance of other cultures while retaining pride in their own; and a confidence that this country can accommodate different races, religions and ideals - indeed that tolerance is a defining characteristic of being British.</p> <p>I think with groups like this, who have that unique power to influence their peers, plus advice to school staff and the wider community, such as the toolkit published today, we can begin to work towards a country in which terrorism really is consigned to history.</p>",
  "<p>An uneasy calm returned to the streets of Bangkok today after violent clashes between police and thousands of anti-government protesters last night left two people dead and more than 400 injured.</p> <p>Soldiers have been deployed on street corners to monitor the situation after members of the People's Alliance for Democracy (Pad) demonstrated outside the reopening of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/thailand\">Thailand</a>'s parliament yesterday.</p> <p>Pad is calling for sweeping electoral changes and trying to force the resignation of the new prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, whom it sees as a puppet of his brother-in-law, the deposed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p> <p>Somchai fled the clashes by helicopter after crawling through a fence.</p> <p>Police used teargas to clear a path for MPs entering the parliament building after two officers were shot. One man lost a foot from the explosion of a teargas grenade and a female protester was killed. Somchai told reporters today that using teargas to restore civil order was the \"international standard\".</p> <p>Some protesters broke away from the main group to target the police headquarters, overturning police vehicles, erecting barricades and fighting with sharpened flagpoles. Despite no signs of renewed street clashes today, troops armed with batons and helmets remained in place outside the police headquarters.</p> <p>Protesters have threatened further demonstrations in the capital as part of a four-month street campaign. A Pad spokesman, Sirichai Maingam, told Thai television: \"We can't stand this government with blood on its hands. More people will hit the streets to oust this government.\"</p> <p>It is the worst uprising since a state of emergency was declared almost two months ago after Pad protesters clashed with government supporters.</p> <p>Somchai has sought to reassure the international community through what is seen as a deepening political crisis, despite the resignation of the deputy prime minister and chief negotiator with Pad, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. \"My government is still able to run the country,\" Somchai told reporters today.</p> <p>The army has denied that the presence of soldiers on the streets could herald another military coup. Shinawatra was deposed in a bloodless coup two years ago while he was out of the country.</p>",
  "<p>Russia began its final pull-out from the so-called buffer zone next to Georgia's breakaway province of South Ossetia this morning, in a move that is likely to lead to a permanent redrawing of the map of Europe.</p> <p>Russian troops today bulldozed their roadside checkpoint in the village of Kareleti, 5km away from the central town of Gori, before driving off towards South Ossetia. Their commander, Major General Marat Kulakhmetov, said soldiers would leave all six posts inside the buffer zone by the end of today. </p> <p>Today's withdrawal follows an EU-brokered ceasefire deal last month. Under the agreement Russia agreed to withdraw all forces by this Friday from buffer zones next to South Ossetia and Russia's other separatist province of Abkhazia. EU observers, who watched today's pull-out, are due to take over security.</p> <p>But Moscow has refused to leave South Ossetia and Abkhazia - despite agreeing on August 12 to withdraw its forces to the positions they occupied before the war with Georgia. The Kremlin says realities changed when it recognised both breakaway regions as independent. It now plans to garrison 7,600 troops there. </p> <p>Additionally, Russian troops are refusing to leave newly captured territory seized during the five-day conflict with Georgia. Most contentiously, Russian and South Ossetian forces are staying in the strategic town of Akhalgori - which was under Georgian administration. The town, 34km north-west of Tbilisi, lies inside the old Soviet borders of South Ossetia. </p> <p>Western diplomats concede that, once Moscow completes its withdrawal from the \"buffer zone\", it is unlikely to budge further. The EU's appetite for sanctions against Moscow, meanwhile, appears to be rapidly diminishing ahead of an international conference in Geneva next week on the future of Georgia and the region.</p> <p>\"The Europeans will now start making a lot of concessions to Russia,\" Zaza Gachechiladze, editor-in-chief of Georgia's the Messenger newspaper said today. \"Russia has very strong levers. Around 60% of natural gas and oil supplies comes from Russia. This is a very powerful tool.\"</p> <p>\"The Europeans care mostly about their comfort. They care for justice and the rule of law only on paper. When it comes to the alternatives [of justice and comfort] they will choose comfort,\" he said. </p> <p>There was little prospect of agreement next week at the Geneva conference, he said, adding that Russia's claim that Abkhazia and South Ossetia were now sovereign states was a fiction. \"Everyone knows that they are puppet entities. Their sovereignty relies on Russian armed forces,\" Gachechiladze said.</p> <p>Inside Georgia, opposition politicians are calling for an independent inquiry into the war two months ago. They say that Russia undoubtedly provoked the situation but blame Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, for launching an attack on South Ossetia on August 7. This, they say, prompted Russia's invasion.</p> <p>The head of the EU monitoring mission, Hansjorg Haber, today expressed satisfaction with the Russian moves to withdraw. </p> <p>\"We always proceeded from the assumption that the process would be completed by Friday, and this is confirmation of that assumption,\" Haber told AP by telephone, speaking from the buffer zone outside Abkhazia. </p> <p>He said he expected Russian forces to withdraw from what he said were 12 checkpoints and a base outside Abkhazia by Friday, but probably not by the end of today. He confirmed that Georgian law enforcement officers would move into the buffer zones as the Russians withdrew.</p> <p>Russia said its pull-out was proceeding \"on track\". \"Russia has begun the withdrawal of its peacekeepers from all the six checkpoints located in the south of the security zone,\" said Igor Konashenkov, aide to the commander of the Russian military's ground forces. </p> <p>In western Georgia, a Reuters television reporter saw a column of 50 to 60 Russian military vehicles leave a military base and cross the Inguri river into breakaway Abkhazia.</p>",
  "<p>Hard drugs are \"readily available\" at a notorious jail and gang violence rife, inspectors revealed today.</p> <p>Prison staff \"struggled to cope\" with drugs and gang activity at the \"squalid\" Risley prison in Warrington, Cheshire, said Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons.</p> <p>More than 60% of inmates suspected of using drugs such as heroin tested positive and some prisoners made their own booze.</p> <p>More than a third of the 1,000 men were also locked in their cells for much of the day.</p> <p>Owers said the problems were extensive and prisoners were concerned for their safety. </p> <p>\"Worryingly, prisoners felt even more unsafe than in the past and a serious drug problem, with associated gang violence, was having a pervasive and pernicious effect,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The establishment's sprawling buildings and poor design added to the difficulties for staff, but there was no excuse for the squalor we found. </p> <p>\"Risley also had insufficient purposeful activity to be an effective training prison, although better use could have been made of what there was.\"</p> <p>Inmates told inspectors gangs offered \"joining fees\" of \u00a350.</p> <p>A further problem was found with illicit mobile phones: more than 50 inmates were found with the banned phones in the first four months of this year, Owers added. </p> <p>Phil Wheatley, the director general of the National Offender Management Service, said the prison was already working to tackle the problems. </p> <p>He said: \"Since the inspection the prison's violence reduction strategy has been reviewed and rewritten, an integrated tackling antisocial behaviour strategy has been introduced and a specialist gang management strategy is being developed in conjunction with the local police. </p> <p>\"These measures are being implemented and will make the prison safer.\" </p> <p>The category C training prison was inspected without warning in April. </p> <p>Prison Reform Trust director Juliet Lyon said the report was \"shocking\". </p> <p>\"In effect, despite the best efforts of many staff, the prison is an intense arena for gang allegiances to be acted out,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Vulnerable prisoners are rendered even more vulnerable and the brutalising impact of incarceration in such an environment can do little if anything to prepare people for a law-abiding life on release.\"</p>",
  "<p>Senior allies of the toppled South African president, Thabo Mbeki, today laid the ground for a breakaway party from the ruling African National Congress because they said its leaders have abandoned the movement's founding principles and put \"our national democracy is in danger\".</p> <p>Mosiuoa Lekota - a former political prisoner on Robben Island, the ANC chairman for a decade and defence minister for 12 years until he resigned after the new party leadership under Jacob Zuma removed Mbeki as president last month - said he and other disillusioned officials will hold a consultative conference within the party that would seem to \"be leading logically\" to a \"divorce\".</p> <p>\"This is probably the parting of the ways,\" he said.</p> <p>Lekota was flanked by the former deputy defence minister, Mluleki George, but did not name any other senior ANC officials as backing the move. However, he said there are significant numbers of rank-and-file members who oppose the existing leadership. </p> <p>Any new political party will face a formidable challenge to take support from the ANC despite growing disillusionment among ordinary voters, particularly a party led by the people who have governed for the past eight years. But the bitterness of Lekota's attack on the leadership that toppled Mbeki from the top of the ANC last year and then as South Africa's president reflects the deep schisms within the ruling party that could see other breakaway factions, particularly on the left over economic policy.</p> <p>Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC's deputy leader, was appointed interim president after Mbeki was ousted but, for now at least, the party intends to make Zuma its candidate at next year's presidential election.</p> <p>Lekota accused the new leadership of hijacking the ANC and \"eliminating our internal democracy\" in order to make Zuma president and to stop him facing trial on corruption charges. </p> <p>\"There has been elevated to national importance interests of individuals rather than the interests of our country. Every meeting, every public appearance, is about how some individual or the other must be made president of South Africa as if the presidency of South Africa is something hereditary,\" he said. </p> <p>The former ANC chairman said that the new party leadership was also betraying the ANC's Freedom Charter, which formed the basis of the liberation struggle, by demanding that there be a \"political solution\" to prevent Zuma facing trial for corruption which could see him sent to prison for years. </p> <p>\"South Africans are getting arrested from time to time. They have to appear before the courts and they have to bring evidence to prove that they are innocent or not. Now we are saying, no, in a particular case - of the state versus the president of the ANC - there must be a political solution. What has happened to the clause in the Freedom Charter: all shall be equal before the law? If one deviates from that clause are we then going to have a political solution for each and every criminal case that arises in this nation or is it only for this particular individual?\" said Lekota.</p> <p>Lekota also said that the Zuma camp had introduced tribalism into the party's internal politics with a campaign projecting Zuma as a \"100% Zulu boy\" and promoted violence with the singing of a song, Bring Me My Machine Gun, that is now a trademark of the ANC leader.</p> <p>\"T-shirts are printed with tribalist slogans decorated with the face of some very senior member of the ANC. At its foundation the ANC's leaders declared that tribalism is the most serious danger to our country and our people. No condemnation, no action to stop it,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Songs which advocate violence at a time when the ANC has negotiated peace for this country, and our people are supposed to be free and live in peace, leaders of the ANC stand on public platforms singing songs that advocate violence and the collection of weapons. To what end? To promote what policy of the ANC?\"</p> <p>But Lekota's accusation that the new ANC leadership is \"eliminating internal democracy\" with a purge of Mbeki's supporters and attacks on Zuma's critics will ring hollow among many of Mbeki's critics who were hounded with a vicious vilification campaign by the former president's backers. </p> <p>Lekota declined to say directly that he will be launching a new party but, when pressed on the issue by reporters, he said that today's announcement amounted to the serving of \"divorce papers\".</p>",

  "<p>Whatever happened to spontaneity in politics? There was a time when I, as a young whippersnapper of an activist, would organise a protest, and then go out and do it. Some protests might be more spontaneous than others: some \u2013 usually those that drew widely from the hotter headed regions of the far left \u2013 might become more excitable.</p> <p>Insofar as we dealt with the police, we did so out of courtesy and a sense that marching 10,000 people through the middle of a crowded town centre on a Saturday without prior notice was probably best not done without some prior notice. </p> <p>How times have changed. This Saturday is <a href=\"http://wiki.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/Freedom_Not_Fear_2008\">Fear not Freedom</a> day. It is a day intended to publicise our gradual drift toward a surveillance society \u2013 not just in the UK, but across Europe. Some 23 countries are likely to be participating in activities of one form or another.</p> <p>In the UK, one event will take place in Parliament Square. It will be a collage of photos intended to illustrate the extent of surveillance, and will be organised by NO2ID and the <a href=\"http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2008/09/29/capturing-the-database-state-community-photocall/\">Open Rights Group</a>. It is an arts event. An image. Whatever else it is, it is <em>not</em> a demonstration.</p> <p>Because if you wish to demonstrate within a \"designated area\" around the Houses of Parliament then, according to <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050015_en_1\">legislation passed in 2005</a>, you must give the police reasonable notice, defined as six days in advance or, where that is not possible, at the very least 24 hours in advance.</p> <p>Over at the Met's HQ a most interesting dance will take place. Sorry: picnic. <a href=\"http://www.peopleincommon.org/\">People in Common</a> will be marking Fear not Freedom day by holding a picnic and carrying blank placards. Their picnic will be in and around Caxton St. If they inadvertently wander into Broadway, they will be demonstrating illegally and may be arrested. If someone scrawls a rude word \u2013 such as \"freedom\" \u2013 on one of the placards, they, too, may be arrested.</p> <p>Although this event will take place outside the designated zone, the event organiser notes that the Met have expressed interest in it in order to \"provide assistance\". This would be all very well if we were still confident of our ancient freedoms to demonstrate and assemble. But as 2008 slips into 2009, that is an area increasingly under pressure. Legislation that governs in minute detail what we may or may not do in the vicinity of parliament is just one piece of the picture. In theory, that particular law is scheduled for removal, anyway. Gordon Brown said it would, so it must be true!</p> <p>Our freedom to demonstrate has been undermined over the last 10 years by a culture of creeping bureaucracy, including the need to carry out and submit to police a \"risk assessment\" before marching. Laws on littering become ever more draconian: a local authority can attack a political organisation for handing out leaflets because, well, they make a mess.</p> <p>Spontaneity in the body politic is slowly bleeding away as the sensibilities of far too many people are lulled by an excess of common sense. Demonstrations are messy. Leafleting is messy. Democracy is messy. We can make them all so much safer, cleaner, more effectively organised by informing and colluding with the authorities at every step of the way. We can ask the police when and where and how we may demonstrate. In time, we might ask them also what slogans we should write and what issues we may highlight, in case we cause offence.</p> <p>But if we go down that road, we do so at our peril. For that way lies the death of spontaneity. And without spontaneity, the political process \u2013 democracy itself \u2013 will be that much the poorer.</p>",
  "<p>The first democratic presidential elections in the Indian Ocean islands of the Maldives could see Asia's longest-serving leader ousted by a human rights activist whom he once imprisoned.<br> Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has been president for the past three decades, faces five rivals in the election, which is the culmination of a peaceful democracy movement that became irresistible after violent riots in 2005.</p> <p>Despite some fears of rigging and threats against political figures earlier this week, the Maldives appeared calm today with a heavy police and military presence. The archipelago of 300,000 people on 1,196 islands is expected to get its new president on Thursday.<br> Gayoom, 71, who has served six terms under a one-candidate system, has pitched himself as the creator of modern-day Maldives. He built an economy on high-end tourism, with resorts overlooking white sand beaches and crystal clear waters where hotels charge thousands of pounds a night. He claims also to have preserved the island's unique brand of Islam. The president faces a serious threat from the founder of the Maldivian Democratic party (MDP), Mohamed \"Anni\" Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience. Nasheed, a slight man who walks with a limp from the torture he endured, has been the president's most effective tormentor, attacking the widening gulf between rich and poor and an alarming rise in drug use. The perception, especially in the crowded capital, Male, is that a corrupt elite has profited from the Gayoom presidency.</p> <p>\"We have seen a real groundswell of public support in the last few weeks. The levels of poverty have become a real issue. There is vast wealth only in the top seven per cent of the population. Seventy per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and there is a social breakdown as the gap between rich and poor widens,\" said the MDP's Nasheen Mohammed.<br> There have been signs of a bubbling conflict on the islands. The Maldives suffered its first terror attack last year, with Islamic militants blamed for bombing a park in Male, wounding a dozen tourists. The MDP considers Male its base: Anni Nasheed was elected to the Maldivian parliament in 2000. Gayoom's political constituency is among the 1,000 smaller islands located 800km (500 miles) off the tip of India. In these rural constituencies, Gayoom's message as protector of Islam plays well. The winner will have to garner more than 50% of the votes to avoid a run-off. With no reliable opinion polls, the outcome is seen as impossible to predict. One local newspaper's internet poll put the MDP at 53% to Gayoom's 10%. This was considered a reflection only of web users' preferences. Gayoom has promised to hand over power peacefully if he loses. Last month, the president signed into law a new constitution establishing an independent judiciary and electoral body. It ended the practice of the parliament approving a single candidate who was put forward in a referendum. On this basis, Gayoom was returned to power six times with what he said was more than 90% of the vote. The new president will lose considerable power, with the new 74-member parliament having the right to block cabinet appointments and produce new laws. According to the new constitution, polls to the new parliament have to take place before next March. \"These elections are important but we need elections for the new parliament quickly. It is the body that will be supreme,\" said the MDP's Nasheen Mohammed.</p>",
  "<p>Some months ago, I worked for a day with 80 secondary school students from three Bristol schools, the majority of them male and all of African heritage. I set them what I thought was a simple exercise, to write down the three things they feared most. Top of their list was dying, followed by death, being killed/murdered, going pen (going to prison), getting stabbed, their loved ones dying around them, anything happening to their family, losing loved ones and finally, the Tories in power. Some of them clearly had no wish to be hugged or led by David Cameron.</p> <p>There is something clearly wrong with a society in which school students in a prosperous city could have such a preoccupation with their own demise and with fear of one another. So wrong, in fact, that no wannabe prime minister should indulge in cheap jibes and headline-seeking sound bites about \"all must win prizes\" and \"dumbing down\", in the same breath as drawing attention to the profile of prisoners in Wandsworth gaol - as David Cameron did <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/01/davidcameron.toryconference1\">last week</a> in Birmingham.</p> <p>Both Cameron and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gove\">Michael Gove</a> subscribe to the neo-liberal ideology of the market as the ultimate leveller, a process in which some inevitably get squashed or pushed to the margins. So Cameron doesn't join up the implications of what he is saying about the prisoners in Wandsworth gaol with his attitude towards the structuring and governance of schooling and the lack of protection and public safeguards for those who are vulnerable and cannot fend for themselves that the whole <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7102595.stm\">Academy</a> movement represents. This survival-of-the-fittest approach to educational entitlement and personalised learning is bound to push to the margins those who, for whatever reasons, don't know how to learn, cannot self-manage and who cry for attention by indulging in behaviour that is challenging or by displaying talents other than those a teacher might be programmed to identify and nurture. </p> <p>Over 60% of the 84,000 prisoners in this country are barely literate. Two-thirds of those held in young-offender institutions were permanently excluded from school. The 1,000 academies Cameron and Gove want to unleash upon the nation's children are hardly likely to embrace a social justice agenda and, unlike schools before them, end the structured omission of issues to do with human rights, discrimination, exploitation and the social exclusion of historically oppressed groups.</p> <p>\"Personalised learning\" and the individual's \"educational entitlement\" must mean validating and rewarding the effort, however meagre, of every child. As such, it is more appropriate at times to celebrate the achievement of the disaffected child whose attainment rises from a G to an E than to rejoice at the achievement of the B-grade student who makes that extra effort and gets an A*. </p> <p>Cameron's social justice credentials are like a string vest, and his and Michael Gove's vision of the role of education in combating disadvantage and unleashing the potential of children irrespective of their social or ethnic background is very blinkered. Every child should matter and all parents should have access to a good local school for their children in their community. Cameron seems to be selling us a recipe for perpetuating our Orwellian schooling system, in which some children continue to matter rather more than others.</p>",
  "<p>The Spanish prime minister <strong>Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero</strong> yesterday announced that his government will introduce a freedom of information law. Speaking at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_American_Press_Association\">Inter-American Press Association</a> assembly in Madrid, he pledged Spain's adoption of \"a new law that guarantees the greatest possible access to public information.\" The pressure group <a href=\"http://www.access-info.org/\">Access Info</a> last week produced a report, \"When public information is not public\", about the poor record of the Spanish administration in providing access.</p>",
  "<p>Moves to ban smacking come before parliament today with MPs facing a vote to abolish the defence of \"reasonable punishment\".</p> <p>The House of Commons will debate a cross-party amendment to the children and young persons bill, which would give children the same protection against physical assault as adults.</p> <p>An alliance of children's charities said a clear majority of MPs would support the abolition of smacking in a free vote. </p> <p>The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats said their MPs could vote with their consciences, but the government is expected to impose a whip requiring Labour MPs to back the current law.</p> <p>Legislation in 2004 allowed parents to hit their children as long as they do not leave a bruise, graze or red mark.</p> <p>More than 100 Labour backbenchers have signed a private statement urging ministers to allow a free vote on this amendment, at the report stage of the bill. </p> <p>Kevin Barron, the Labour chairman of the Commons health committee, said: \"How can reforms to stop hurting animals be more worthy of a free vote than a reform to stop hurting the most vulnerable human beings?\"</p> <p>Last week the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child criticised the government for failing to prohibit corporal punishment in the family.</p> <p>Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: \"Like most people \u2013 including most parents \u2013 we agree that smacking isn't a good thing and other means of controlling children's behaviour are preferable and probably more effective. </p> <p>\"But neither do we support a ban which would make smacking a crime, and criminalise decent parents for a mild smack. The majority of parents support this common sense approach. </p> <p>\"Both the Crown Prosecution Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers agree that the law as it stands gives them the power and discretion to act in the best interests of the child and the public interest.\"</p> <p>Already 19 other European countries that have banned corporal punishment in the family.</p> <p>The vote comes after an NSPCC survey last night revealed about 160,000 teenagers over the age of 15 have recently been beaten by parents trying to assert discipline.</p> <p>The children's charity poll of more than 1,900 parents showed one in eight children of all ages were smacked during the past six months.</p> <p>The survey found the peak age for hitting was when the child was four, but the charity was surprised to find how much physical punishment persisted into the mid-teens.</p> <p>About 7% of young people aged 15-17 had been hit by a parent in the last six months - equivalent to 160,000 pupils going through the final years in secondary school.</p> <p>Dame Mary Marsh, the charity's chief executive, said: \"Parents who are hitting teenagers are likely to have been smacking their children since they were small - so it clearly isn't working. We fear these parents are hitting their children harder and harder. \"</p> <p>Her view was supported by Rebecca Boden, 50, professor of management at University of Wales Institute in Cardiff, who is suffering brain damage after beatings as a child. </p> <p>A recent scan revealed scars from head trauma that was probably caused by persistent beatings from her father.</p> <p>She said: \"It started when I was about 10. My father used to punch my head behind the ear - so it wouldn't leave a mark. </p> <p>\"I was a tiny slip of a girl and my father was a 6ft 2in man. I would be thrown to the ground with the force of his blows. He used to literally fell me.</p> <p>\"To adult eyes, I was being punished for being naughty. His blows were considered smacking and my teacher told me it was character building.</p> <p>\"I endured eight years of being punched and hit around the head. I was so terrified that well into my teens, I would wet myself at the sight of a raised fist.\"</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch has already hit the book trade, and its effects will be more and more visible in the coming months: but publishers are hoping this means changes to the stock rather than the till receipts.</p> <p>As stock indexes slide, thrifty how-to guides are already on the rise. Waterstone's, for instance, has seen 200% increases in sales of two titles about keeping chickens in recent weeks. \"And Carol Klein's Grow Your Own Veg sales are double what they were a year ago, which could be put down to people looking for long-term money-saving ideas in the current climate,\" says non-fiction buyer Alex Ingram.</p> <p>This Christmas will see the launch of a slew of thrifty titles as publishers look to profit from this demand, headed up by a timely new edition of Delia Smith's slump cuisine classic Frugal Food, and India Knight, the author of retail therapy guide The Shops having a go at making-do and mending. November's The Thrift Book: Live Well and Spend Less sees Knight variously detail how to make jam, use a sewing machine, dress on a budget, and make your own presents.</p> <p>Expect thrifty nostalgia too, as publishers mine their back catalogues to come up with money saving tips from days of yore. \"Books on saving string, thrift in World War Two - publishers would be well advised to check out their backlist and see if they've got these sorts of books,\" says Alan Samson, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson publishing director.</p> <p>Looking from the other end of the telescope, a glut of proposals about the crisis on Wall Street have hit American publishers' desks over the last week, and million-dollar advances will be shielding the best of their authors from the crash's fallout. Too Big to Fail by New York Times business reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin, Six Days that Shook the World by Roger Lowenstein and a chronicle of events from Joe Nocera and Vanity Fair's Bethany McLean all commanded big sums at auction, but here in the UK the book industry is - so far - markedly more cautious.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of proposals flying around - both from well-placed journalists and City bankers who suddenly have more time on their hands. It's true that the readership for business and finance books has widened dramatically - suddenly everyone knows what short-selling is and has an opinion on HBOS,\" says Viking's editorial director Joel Rickett. \"But with so much media analysis already available, publishers have to be extremely careful to find books with substance and enduring quality.\"</p> <p>Samson agrees: \"Personally I think it is all too messy for a sensible book on the subject, and needs a little perspective before a really good book appears. In the words of William Goldman about the movie industry, nobody knows anything. But I can envisage a new and fictionalised analysis like Crash of 79 by Paul Erdman working 30 years later.\"</p> <p>Samson is also on the hunt for a book about \"a future dystopic global scenario\" such as John Hackett's Third World War, a novel imagining the next world war which became an international bestseller in the early 80s, or Alvin Toffler's runaway 70s bestseller Future Shock, about the difficulties inherent in advancement. </p> <p>Reading about hard times, meanwhile, is not the same as reading <em>for </em>them. The book trade is currently poring over the bestseller lists from previous eras of financial uncertainty, trying to work out how best to entertain a tighter-belted reading public. Back in the recession of the early 80s, cash-strapped readers were lapping up Jackie Collins sex, rock'n'roll and shopping saga Lovers and Gamblers. </p> <p>\"Stories of the mega-rich and royalty also seem to hold a perverse fascination when times are tough,\" says Viking editorial director Joel Rickett, and the start of the 80s was heralded by chart-topping performances for a biography of the Queen Mother by Godfrey Talbot, and Mark Girouard's look at Life in the English Country House. </p> <p>This is echoed in the recession of the early 1990s, when the non-fiction charts were topped by Andrew Morton's Diana: Her True Story and Peter Mayle's escapist A Year in Provence. In fiction, Jilly Cooper's monied classes romp Polo was number one, and this time round publishers are crossing their fingers that Olivia Darling's artworld melodrama Priceless, and Tasmina Perry's story of a luxury goods dynasty Guilty Pleasures, will be feeding the nation's daydreams.</p> <p>\"We're thinking more widely about the kind of books that sell when times are tight,\" says Rickett. \"Escapism is one answer: crime and thrillers will go on selling by the truckload. People will want to bury themselves in fast, compelling stories,\" and this is borne out by the huge sales enjoyed by the likes of Thomas Harris, Dick Francis and Jeffrey Archer during recent downturns. </p> <p>Romance publisher Mills &amp; Boon says it has traditionally enjoyed stronger sales in times of crisis, as miserable workers live an imaginary high life among handsome Arab sheikhs and smouldering Italian tycoons. \"Billionaires are here to stay - we've always been aspirational, that's part of our promise; we've never tried to be achievable.\"</p> <p>Publishers hope their own aspirations are more realistic. If they can successfully match their output with changing tastes, they are quietly confident they can ride out the worst of a retail downturn. So far this year book sales are down 1% on 2007, according to book monitor service Nielsen BookScan, although this can largely be attributed to last year's publication of Harry Potter. \"Books are high value but low price,\" says Philip Jones, managing editor of thebookseller.com. \"Everyone is saying that books are recession proof, and so far nothing's happened to disprove that.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the British Fashion Council released its <a href=\"http://www.modelhealthinquiry.com/\">feasibility report</a> on health checks for models at London fashion week, the focus was entirely female. There's a reason for this: London fashion week itself almost entirely ignores menswear, so there are few male models to be concerned about, skinny or otherwise \u2013 for the British Fashion Council, \"fashion\" seems to only mean \"womenswear\". </p> <p>Whatever the gender, its study was a depressing affair. The term \"size zero\" is one used to provoke moral outrage, and the British Fashion Council announced its Model Health Inquiry to make it seem like it was engaged in relevant, contemporary issues. The inquiry found it was <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/14/health.fashion \">unworkable</a> to force models into a health check before London fashion week, the reasons being practical, logistical and moral. You can read the <a href=\"http://www.modelhealthinquiry.com/latest.html\">study online</a>. The words sound like those of a typical pointless quango.</p> <p>Now someone is paying attention to male models, but it feels utterly phoney. There used to be a popular TV show called The Clothes Show, from which was spun a fee-paying annual event that exploited the popularity of the programme. The TV show was cancelled years ago, but the event still trundles on, entirely irrelevant to anything that's occurring in fashion. In an attempt to gain some spin, Clothes Show Live has announced that \"unnaturally thin\" male models will be <a href=\" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3146929/Male-models-who-are-too-thin-have-been-banned-from-the-catwalk.html\">banned from its shows</a>, in response to an increase in cases of what its own press release calls \"manorexia\".</p> <p>It is the inclusion of this word that raises alarm bells. \"Manorexia\" is a cheapening label, making eating disorders sound like a trend, a depersonalised wave of behaviour rather than an incredibly individual condition, the result of thought processes, behavioural patterns and misguided beliefs that change from sufferer to sufferer. Helping those with an eating disorder is best done softly-softly, with a gentle encouragement for sufferers to see themselves in life a different way. Shock, judgmental statements don't do anything to help.</p> <p>Clothes Show Live are connecting male eating disorders to fashion, but it is stark that the most public admittance of the condition recently has come from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/apr/21/health.johnprescott?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">John Prescott</a>. His admission earlier this year that he suffered from bulimia for two decades was seen as a shocking revelation, because eating disorders are so often linked only with glamour and image. Prescott's condition had entirely other causes. Male eating disorders are barely examined, discussed or understood. A press release on \"manorexia\" doesn't take anything further forward.</p> <p>This is where fashion is currently at: skinny male models were indeed a big presence a few years ago. Menswear has moved on from this, and is now engaged in a more athletic frame. If a model is too thin, that man needs help and support, not to be judged and then dismissed as if he's a contestant on The X Factor. With all people who suffer from an eating disorder, look at the person, not the condition.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>9am:</strong> The prime minister is giving a press conference in Downing Street at 9.15am. He will be appearing with Alistair Darling, the chancellor, and it will give both men the chance to explain and defend their banking bail-out. I'll be live blogging as soon as it starts.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>9.25am:</strong> Before the press conference starts, I've just been reading the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking1\">Treasury statement about the bail-out.</a> For anyone still confused about what this means, it's worth pointing out that there are three parts to the package - with three chunks of money attached:</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>1. Extending the government's special liquidity scheme, (ie making money available for banks to borrow) - \"at least \u00a3200bn\" is available.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2. Buying shares in banks (to provide them with extra capital) - at total of \u00a350bn available, \u00a325bn in the first tranche and then another \u00a325bn available later.</p> <p>3. A lending guarantee (ie, a promise that if banks lend to each other, and one of them goes bust, the lender won't lose money) - expected to be worth \u00a3250bn.</p> <p>I've been a journalist for almost 20 years. I've never seen a government press release with such enormous figures in it.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>9.25am:</strong> Brown is here. He says extraordinary times call for \"bold, far-reaching solutions\".</p> <p>The stability and restructring programme is \"comprehensive, specific and it breaks new ground\".</p> <p>While over the last year the government has acted to strengthen the system, ministers started work on this package some weeks ago.</p> <p>No one measure alone will be sufficient.</p> <p>This is not a time for \"out-dated thinking or conventional dogma\". It needs an innovative approach.</p> <p>Brown is now running through the three main points I outlined earlier.</p> <p>On buying shares, he says the government is determined that UK banking should be \"strong and secure\".</p> <p>On the lending guarantee, he says this will be offered for a \"fully commercial fee\". It will earn a \"proper return\".</p> <p>The measures should allow banks to return to their \"proper function\".</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>9.25am:</strong> The government is also taking legal action against the Icelandic authorities to help pay for compensation to those who lost money through Icesave.</p> <p>Because the economy should be built around the work-ethic, the government will also need to be satisfied that dividend payments and bank salaries are satisfactory.</p> <p>Because these are global problems, global action is required. This is a \"long haul\". Brown says he has spoken to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, this morning about a coordinated EU response.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Brown invites Darling to add to his statement. Darling says we are going through a period of \"extraordinary turbulence in every part of the world\".</p> <p>The government wanted to \"stabilise the position\", help banks build up their capital position and make it easier for banks to lend to each other. If banks lend to each other, they can then lend to us \"as businesses, individuals and so on\".</p> <p>Darling says, as he's said before, he will continue to do \"whatever it takes\" to stablise the banking system.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> Darling weighs in. He said that although the government lend money to Northern Rock, more than half of that has now been repaid.</p> <p>On the special liquidity scheme, Darling says the money is being lent and will be repaid. The shares are being bought and will be sold in due course. And the lending guarantee is on commercial terms.</p> <p>Robinson says they are implying it's cost-free. He says that, if it was so easy, why wasn't it done before.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> Darling says: \"The government, of course, funds these things through borrowing ..... Frankly, only a government can do this.\"</p> <p>An ITN journalist asks why the government won't guarantee savings.</p> <p>Brown says \"every time a bank has been in difficulty we have made sure that depositors have been safe\". The government has done this with Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Icesave.</p> <p>The government could have just provided more liquidity, or could have done what the Americans did, and bought up bad assets. But it took a different approach because it wanted to deal with the short-term problems and the long-term problems too.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Brown says he is also insisting that he will be satisfied about \"executive renumeration\" ie, bonuses. Others might want to ask about this, he says. That means he's dying to say more about it.</p> <p>Andy Bell from Five News takes the bait. He asks Brown what he thinks about the way the banks have run their businesses.</p> <p>Where people work hard and are responsible, they should be rewarded, Brown says. But not when they are irresponsible and put the whole system at risk. That's why he's insisting that \"renumeration ... is on the agenda\". He goes on: \"There are strings attached.\" But does this mean no bonuses? Or just smaller ones?</p> <p>Gary Gibbon from Channel 4 wants to know: \"Who is to blame?\"</p> <p>Brown says it started in America.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Some banks did not know what risks they were taking on. There was \"a failure of responsibility\". He says the Financial Services Authority has already said it could have done some things better.</p> <p>People want to know that the banks will do the jobs for which they are intended, he says.</p> <p>British banks have had \"a great record in the past\". \"We are going to ensure that the problems ... are solved.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Joey Jones from Sky says Brown seems to think he can \"walk away from the wreckage ... smelling of roses\".</p> <p>Brown says he does not accept that he was to blame. He says he has \"led the world today\" with his plans. Other countries may want to follow what the Treasury is doing.</p> <p>James Landale from the BBC wants to know what's Plan B. What will happen if this doesn't work?</p> <p>Brown says his plan his more ambitious than people expected. He will do whatever it takes to ensure stability.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> Ben Brogan from the Daily Mail asks about risk. If the \u00a3250bn is being lent against \"dodgy assets\", there must be a risk?</p> <p>Darling says there will be a commercial fee for these guarantees.</p> <p>(By the way, where's Robert Peston? Are they allowed to hold a press conference without him there?)</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> Brown says we should look at the proposals as a whole.</p> <p>Jon Snow from Channel 4 says that if we are partially nationalising the banks, but not putting anyone on th board or putting anyone in to run them, how will the government ensure they do start lending to each other.</p> <p>Darling says he is not seeking to take public control. On the Today programme this morning he tried to reject the \"part-nationalisation\" label.</p> <p>But I think he's probably too late - all the newspapers are using this formula to describe what's happening this morning.</p> <p>A GMTV journalist asks how worried Brown is about people losing their jobs?</p> <p>Brown says a sound banking system is critical to everyone.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> George Parker from the FT asks Brown to respond to allegations that he should have made the announcement on Monday but that he \"dithered\".</p> <p>Darling said he needed to work the plan through. He says he has made his \"extreme irritation\" at the speculation that emerged on Sunday very clear.</p> <p>But, actually, I don't think he has said that publicly before. He's referring to the Tories, who started calling for a recapitalisation programme at the weekend, apparently in the hope of appearing to be \"ahead of the game\".</p> <p>Brown says it was right to act in a \"calm and orderly way\". The public want to know that \"those who are charged with leadership\" will act in a calm and orderly way.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> A Newsnight journalist asks if Brown and Darling will apologise for the panic over the last 48 hours and the \"silent run on the banks\".</p> <p>Brown rejects the charge. His programme is \"far more comprehensive then ever people were asking for\".</p> <p>Andrew Porter from the Daily Telegraph asks if the removal of the Royal Bank of Scotland board was a condition of the deal.</p> <p>\"Absolutely not,\" says Darling.</p> <p>Patrick Wintour from the Guardian asks why Brown didn't follow the Paulson plan.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9.55am:</strong> Brown says the Americans do not yet know how much they are going to have to spend on the toxic assets they are committed to buy. He has taken a \"bold and far-reaching decision\".</p> <p>David Stringer from AP asks when Brown will discuss the crisis with G7 colleagues.</p> <p>Brown says he is putting plans about a medium-term funding scheme to EU colleagues. Darling is attending a G7 finance meeting soon and there are plans for a G7 heads of government meeting.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10.00am:</strong> He has proposals about regulation, supervision, disclosure and transparency.</p> <p>Kitty Donaldson from Bloomberg asks about Darling's Mais lecture tonight and the arrangements for salaries.</p> <p>Darling says he has postponed this evening's Mais lecture in the City.</p> <p>The government will not decide on people's pay. But the FSA is looking at these issues, and particularly the question of incentives.</p> <p>Brown says pay will be an issue in the discussions with banks.</p> <p>A journalist from the Newcastle Journal asks for a guarantee that public spending will not be hit.</p> <p>Brown says his record on public spending is a good one.</p> <p>Catherine Mayer from Time asks if there has been a failure of political leadership.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>10.00am:</strong> Darling says the Americans, like the UK government, have reacted appropriately.</p> <p>A journalist from AFP asks why dividend payments are an issue. If the government is taking shares in banks, then surely it should want dividends to be as high as possible.</p> <p>Good question. Darling says that Brown has covered this already (which he hadn't).</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> Another journalist asks if this marks the death of Brown's fiscal rules.</p> <p>Brown says he wants to put the emphasis on restructuring.</p> <p>James Lyons from the Mirror asks how far through the crisis we are. Another good question.</p> <p>Brown says we are in it for the long-haul.</p> <p>That's it. Darling says he's off to a briefing at the Treasury.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10.25am:</strong> <strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p>Brown and Darling both put on a fairly confident performance, all things considered. Brown was very keen to stress the bold and far-reaching nature of his package, which he seems to think will provide a model form of intervention for other countries to follow. For all I know, he may be right. But what was really striking was what he couldn't say, or couldn't answer.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong> the Treasury has published the bald figures, but when journalists such as Nick Robinson tried to discover what this would mean for the taxpayer, they drew a complete blank. At the moment Brown and Darling are giving the impression that the Treasury can just whistle up this money from nowhere. I'm no expert on this, and no doubt Larry Elliott will explain all at some point, but I'm pretty sure that the Treasury can't borrow money on this scale without some impact on the public finances.</p> <p><strong>Bonuses and salaries:</strong> Brown was keen to give the impression that there would be a clampdown on bank bonuses, but when Darling was pressed about this he said that the government, even though it is becoming a shareholder in these banks, would not be trying to determine executive salaries. </p> <p>And on bonuses he suggested that the only action that would be taken would be the FSA review already underway intended to ensure that banks that reward excessive risk-taking with big bonuses will have to have more capital in reserve in case things go wrong.</p> <p>The issue of bonuses is a hugely sensitive one (which is why the Tories have been talking it up). I'm pretty sure that when Darling speaks in the Commons, MPs will express real anger about the prospect of executives in part-nationalised banks continuing to pocket huge salaries.</p> <p><strong>Dithering:</strong> Brown said that it was important to proceed in a calm and orderly way. But he did not have a good explanation as to why the government could not have acted on Monday morning, before bank shares went into free-fall, instead of 48 hours later. After all, it's not as if the Treasury hasn't seen this coming.</p> <p><strong>The economy:</strong> How bad is it going to get? Obviously, no one knows. But I'm not sure Brown said anything to make people feel much more confident about it.</p> <p><strong>Bank guarantees:</strong> Brown said that anyone worried about the safety of bank deposits should look at what the government does, not what it says. The decision to reimburse the Icesave savers is a bold one (which will put another black hole in Treasury accounts). But we don't know yet whether it will stop UK investors withdrawing money from UK banks.</p>",
  "<p>Markets may be crashing all over the world yet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camembert_(cheese)\">camembert</a> stands proudly. Let it be a lesson for all those rogue traders from derivative markets: the French cheese has won a historical victory against cynical producers of fake camemberts for whom profits were more important than history, craft and authenticity.</p> <p>The battle started 20 years ago when <a href=\"http://www.lactalis.fr/\">Lactalis</a> (part of the <a href=\"http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Besnier-SA-Company-History.html\">Besnier empire</a>, the second-largest cheese producer in the world), who had bought the prestigious Normandy brand <a href=\"http://www.lepetit.fr/\">Lepetit</a>, switched from the traditional method of hand-moulding to using machines which produced 80,000 uniform camemberts a day. However, reaching stratospheric levels of production wasn't enough. In 1998, the company tried to negotiate with the French authorities to do away with the costly process of using unpasteurised milk while retaining their AOC (<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d'origine_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e\">appellation d'origine control\u00e9e</a></em>) certificate. </p> <p>The food critic P\u00e9rico Legasse of the weekly newspaper Marianne immediately called his country citizens to <a href=\"http://marianne2.fr/Camembert-au-lait-cru-on-a-gagne-!_a91818.html?voir_commentaire=oui\">take up arms</a>. He urged French consumers to look carefully at the kind of camembert they were buying: they learnt that a beautiful old-fashioned label didn't necessarily mean that the camembert wrapped up inside had been produced the authentic way. At the time, Lactalis argued that unpasteurised cheese could present health hazards for the public, an argument that has since been rejected by scientists. </p> <p>A year ago, a documentary called <a href=\"http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=mWVpaYFbmaY&amp;feature=related\">Ces Fromages qu'on Assassine</a> was broadcast on French television and worked as a catalyst for the revolt of consumers who gradually stopped buying Lepetit camemberts. They instead rushed to the Saint Loup, Graindorge and other brands using unpasteurised milk only \u2013 and their sales soared by 35%. French authorities also realised the issues at stake and put together a law that was passed on September 18. It states that AOC camembert can only be made with unpasteurised milk. A week later, Lactalis had to close down its Lepetit factory; its plummeting sales had made it unprofitable. </p> <p>A victory for France and its cheeses which, according to cheese legend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Studd\">Will Studd</a>, \"smell like the feet of God\".</p> <p>PS: for recipes of camembert dishes such as camembert pie and garlic and camembert tartine, see <a href=\"http://www.camembert-aoc.org/htm/news/2001.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.camembert-aoc.org/htm/news/2002.htm\">here</a>.</p>",

At that time, a spokesman for Daily Mirror owner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/trinitymirror\">Trinity Mirror</a> told MediaGuardian.co.uk that the company was reviewing how it could improve the efficiency of its businesses to remain competitive.</p> <p>\"Following a review of news, features and picture desks, this will unfortunately lead to a number of job losses in these areas,\" the spokesman said last month.</p> <p>\"We are now in a period of consultation with our employees. However, it is hoped that many of the proposed redundancies can be offset by voluntary redundancy and redeployment across the titles.\"</p> <p>A Mirror insider told MediaGuardian.co.uk that a number of voluntary redundancies and vacant posts elsewhere on the title had prevented more senior job losses as staff moved to fill other posts.</p> <p>At the time of announcing the latest developments, Trinity Mirror had not responded to a request for further comment by MediaGuardian.co.uk.</p> <p>These Daily Mirror cutbacks are the latest stage of a series of sweeping cost-cutting measures Trinity Mirror has launched amid a falling share price and a plunge in advertising revenue.</p> <p>In July, Trinity Mirror axed 11 subeditors as it integrated some subbing operations across the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People.</p> <p>Mirror Group created a \"central production unit\" for its features operation in a bid to cut costs.</p> <p>Earlier, the company issued a profit warning, which resulted in the share price slumping more than 28% after it said profits would be 10% lower than expected this year.</p> <p>In August, Trinity Mirror announced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/20/trinitymirror.pressandpublishing\">major overhaul of its Midlands regional publishing operation</a>, which led to all 300 of the division's journalists being asked to reapply for their jobs, with 65 journalists' posts to be closed.</p> <p>Staff at Trinity Mirror's Glasgow-based titles, including the Daily Record, are currently engaged in a work-to-rule programme over concerns about what they claim is a lack of editorial resources.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p><strong>1. Reginald Bosanquet (ITN) </strong></p> <p>Reggie Bosanquet was a man who could safely be described as old school. In order to de-stress from the pressures of slurring the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhlnDQS5KEE&amp;feature=related\">News at Ten from the side of his mouth</a> every night during the 1970s, he purchased himself a bar billiards table and installed it in the family home. \"It is my contention that the saving grace of men is their ability to get engrossed in some trivial pastime or diversion which protects them from the basically feminine failing of becoming neurotic,\" he reasoned. His wife Felicity having taken understandable umbrage to a pub game becoming the centrepiece of their flat, divorce was not long in coming. After Felicity cleared out her things, Bosanquet was forced to clamber up a drainpipe in order to gain access to his now-empty abode. Subsequently fingered for breaking and entering, he lost his gigs as Patron of the All-England Bar Billiards Association and member of the judging panel for the prestigious Dustman of the Year awards, and was carpeted by ITN bosses for his trouble to boot.</p> <p>This sort of character simply wouldn't get within 500 yards of a camera these days, and more's the pity. A renowned boozer, Bosanquet - whose father Bernard, a cricketer for Middlesex, is credited with the invention of the googly - was often asked to prove his sobriety before broadcasting by walking along a line specially painted on the ITN floor. \"I like having a drink,\" he admitted in the most aptly titled autobiography in the history of publishing, Let's Get Through Wednesday. \"An item in one of the papers recently told of my receiving a TV camera crew at my flat at 10am for an interview and 'of course Reggie was found to be into the champagne'. This was stated as though it were something terrible! But apart from weddings, when else does one drink champagne except at breakfast?\"</p> <p>In addition to his newscasting skills, he also recorded the peerless disco track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmln-WNhvw\">Dance With Me</a>, the lyrics of which (\"You're in a pub, a caf\u00e9, a club / Then move on cos you've had 'nuff\") are disconcertingly similar to large chunks of Trashbat Is by Nathan Barley. Who wants autocuties when you could have all this?</p> <p><strong>2. Anna Ford (ITN) </strong></p> <p>Bosanquet's take on Anna Ford becoming, in 1976, the second woman to read the news in Britain on a full-time basis (the BBC's Angela Rippon being the first) was as you'd pretty much imagine. Having \"things to say about the problems of women undertaking on television serious jobs such as newsreading, in particular the possibility of their appearance distracting the viewers\", he \"put forth to the ITN bosses\" regarding the matter. Though he did in fairness generously add: \"I was open to being proved wrong - which of course I have been.\"</p> <p>Ford's supercool excellence in front of the camera quickly won the old boy over - \"She is a very competent and professional lady\" - though perhaps other aspects of her personality impressed him more. \"The first thing he said to me was: 'Do you play darts?',\" she remembered. \"And he shut the office door and there was a very used dartboard on the back of it. Luckily, because of working on the newsdesk at Granada, I'd played a lot of darts and a lot of snooker, so I could keep my end up. And he put a bottle of wine in my desk. We got on very well.\"</p> <p>Having broken into television journalism in an era when boys were still very much tediously boys, Ford has fought the good fight against the establishment ever since, once pushing Robin Day into a bush, throwing a glass of wine in Jonathan Aitken's face (cleverly getting it topped up first to ensure maximum soakage), and railing against the ageism at the BBC. A true hero.</p> <p><strong>3. Ed Murrow (CBS) </strong></p> <p>Ed Murrow's television career was technically spent at the helm of a current affairs programme, but as he also spent his time presenting news reports on CBS radio, he counts as far as we're concerned. \"This is an old team trying to learn a new trade,\" Murrow self-deprecatingly announced at the start of the first-ever edition of See It Now in 1951 \u2013 somewhat disingenuously as, having covered World War II for CBS in Europe to great acclaim, he knew full well how good he was.</p> <p>It wouldn't take long for the old team to learn their new trade, and within three years Murrow had such a command of the medium that he was able to calmly feed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcffD41vu2s\">foam-mouthed Joseph McCarthy</a> enough rope to hang himself. His famous riffs to camera have never been bettered in a newsroom anywhere, sprinkled as they were with highfalutin literary references and delivered with eyebrow insouciantly arched and fag on. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMWyXfzfvMI\">\"The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it -- and rather successfully. Cassius was right. 'The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves'. Good night, and good luck.\"</a></p> <p>It's a tad sharper than \"And finally...\" isn't it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8JKHOOFwkr4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8JKHOOFwkr4&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/8JKHOOFwkr4&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>4. Sue Lawley (BBC) </strong></p> <p>Murrow was a picture of studied cool, though whether he would have been able to put up with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKHOOFwkr4\">situations such as the one above</a> is a moot point. The consummate professional, Lawley ploughs on while, alongside her, an unedifying grapple ensues. (A grapple which, incidentally, conjures up some frankly unsavoury mental images, given they involve a sweaty Nicholas Witchell.) Lawley even manages to inform viewers of the brouhaha with a wonderfully British flourish (\"I'm afraid we have rather been invaded\"), as though she were swatting a wasp away from a plate of cucumber sandwiches. Broadcasting at its most staunch.</p> <p><strong>5. John Craven (BBC) </strong></p> <p>Craven spent 17 years reading the news to minor malcontents who were totally radged off that their parents were forcing them to sit through Newsround then suffer Blue Peter, while there were perfectly good Warner Brothers cartoons on the other side. And yet, for the most part, he somehow kept them interested without once patronising his audience. Which is something Jeremy Paxman will never be able to boast, and he's only got to talk to the ABC1s after all.</p> <p>Factor out the stories about pandas unable to get it up, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUEZvnbYq54\">Craven's Newsround was basically pitched at the same level as modern-day current affairs</a>. Which isn't pushing a point too far when you consider what's on, say, Fox News. Speaking of which, we'd also back Craven to totally own Bill O'Reilly in a fistfight.</p> <p><strong>6. Sophie Raworth (BBC) </strong></p> <p>\"There are a number of pretty young women and handsome young men without a solid journalistic background reading the news nowadays. You don't need to have been to a war zone to read the news, but it does help.\" Such is the opinion of Mark Austin, crack reporter and newscaster, whose biggest foreign gig appears to have been doing the links on Survivor.</p> <p>Given Ford, Lawley and Rippon routed this sort of miserable attitude back in the mid-1970s, it's pretty depressing that here we are over three decades later dealing with the same tired arguments yet again. It seems that certain newsreaders \u2013 almost always women \u2013 will forever have to defend themselves for not gadding around in a flak jacket like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvyX-CwHpAQ\">Donnnald Bethl'hem</a>.</p> <p>Why, we're not sure. Sophie Raworth, for example, seems no less well equipped to read the news than anyone who has gone before or after her, from Kenneth Kendall through Peter Woods and Leonard Parkin to Natasha Kaplinsky. She does, however, do so without any semblance of showbiz fuss, no mean feat these days. She also wins many brownie points for annoying David Mellor. Responding to Raworth landing the BBC One O'Clock gig, Mellor harrumphed: \"Beauty beats brains yet again.\" Which is a very odd thing for Mellor to opine about, given those are the two concepts surely most alien to him.</p>",
  "<p>Last night's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08assess.html\">presidential town hall</a> debate in Nashville was beyond infuriating. The Republican candidate said that his plans would amount to \"a net spending cut.\" He promised to go \"line by line through the federal budget\" with a newly sharpened \"scalpel\" and start to cut.</p> <p>The GOP candidate said he would \"favour nuclear power\" as part of a broader scheme for how to supply the country's energy needs while cutting back on foreign oil dependence. He proposed a \"50% tax credit\" to help people purchase healthcare.</p> <p>In foreign affairs, he promised to \"kill bin Laden and ... crush al-Qaida\" by invading Pakistan, if necessary. He said that Russia had \"engaged in evil behaviour\" and pledged to use all possible means to keep Iran from acquiring nukes, including increased sanctions and not-so-veiled threats.</p> <p>Actually, that's a half-lie, or, if you prefer, a half-truth. All of the above quotes were uttered last night, but the speaker was Democratic standard bearer Senator Barack Obama. He and Republican senator John McCain surely have their disagreements but they sounded so alike on that stage last night that it was hard to tell.</p> <p>Perhaps that's because McCain didn't sound like much of a Republican. He actually attacked Herbert Hoover at one point, whose presidency he is almost old enough to remember. \"I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his,\" McCain said, pointing to Obama.</p> <p>McCain promised to leave tax brackets essentially unchanged and sold his mix of increased income tax deductions for children and tax credits for healthcare as something that would overwhelmingly benefit the poor and working class. Why, McCain said, the only people who would be inconvenienced by his health plan would be those with \"gold plated Cadillac kind of policies.\"</p> <p>Or perhaps it was because Obama didn't sound like much of a liberal Democrat. He promised, a la that titan of triangulation former president Bill Clinton, that he would \"provide a tax cut for 95% of Americans. 95%.\" To help sell his plans to increase state funding of health, he appealed to those \"small business owners, a lot of them, [who] can't even afford health insurance for themselves.\"</p> <p>Some of this was for show, no doubt. McCain is trying to appeal to liberal swing voters. Obama wants to convince more conservative Americans that he won't be so scary as president. This great big bear hug of the middle has left Americans with far fewer options than they deserve.</p> <p>McCain is a conservative warmonger and Obama a liberal interventionist. That means they disagree about Iraq but agree that America ought to be doing more abroad to make the world safe for whatever Americans favour this week. Serious restraint isn't even on the table.</p> <p>Domestically, both candidates voted for the recent massive Wall Street bailout, ignoring progressive and conservative objections to the legislation. Both agree that things are really bad but not so bad that some \"hope\" and \"change\" and that indomitable fighting American spirit can't fix things right up.</p> <p>Who was the victor last night? Obama. Or McCain. It sure wasn't the great nation that one of these men will soon preside over.</p>",
  "<p>This is the debate that will be most memorable for what didn't happen.</p> <p>Think back to the build-up. The McCain people, led by the indefatigable Embarracuda, promised that the gloves would come off tonight. Who is the real Barack Obama? Why does he \"pal around\" with a former terrorist? Isn't he too risky? Isn't he not quite a real and regular American? </p> <p>Those were the seeds the McCain campaign led us to believe the candidate would plant at this debate. And what happened? Nothing like that ever came up.</p> <p>This was a function of the format. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/07/barackobama.johnmccain\">I wrote before the debate</a>, the fact that regular people were asking most of the questions was bound to make it very hard for John McCain to pivot away from talking to a regular voter about his or her economic problems to saying, \"and oh, by the way, let me tell you about Bill Ayers\" and so on. </p> <p>Add to that the fact that the stock market has lost 850 points in the last two days. The voter-questioners \u2013 far preferable to journalists \u2013 wanted answers to actual problems. There were no culture war questions \u2013 not one, about abortion or the Supreme Court or anything of the sort. And there was no room for McCain to hoist the red flags that so excite his base.</p> <p>There was a lot of jabbing back and forth, in fact too much of it, on both candidates' parts. And it didn't work for either candidate. I was watching on CNN, which runs a real-time response meter across the bottom of the screen showing the immediate reactions of swing voters in Ohio. Almost every time one candidate reproached the other on anything like a personal basis, the response meters dipped toward negative territory. It was when they talked about their plans that the needles stayed in positive territory.</p> <p>Bottom line? Don't listen to me, listen to the swing voters. The two immediate post-debate focus-group polls gave Obama the win. A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/07/politics/horserace/entry4508356.shtml\">CBS poll of 400 nationwide uncommitted voters</a> had it Obama 39%, McCain 27%, draw 35%. A small group in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania assembled by MSNBC was less scientific, obviously. There seemed to be about two dozen of them. When the network's Campbell Brown asked for shows of hands on who won, it sure looked to me like about three-quarters of them raised their hands for Obama. Brown pegged it at about 60-40 for Obama. Whatever, she was there.</p> <p>As to what did happen? I thought there were three moments of distinction. The first came when Tom Brokaw asked them to rank how they'd rank energy, healthcare, and entitlement costs as priorities that had to be dealt with. Obama actually answered the question, in the order I listed them. McCain said we don't have to rank them and can do them all. </p> <p>The second came when they were asked what kind of sacrifices they would ask Americans to make as we enter the dark period. Obama invoked 9-11 \u2013 now there's a first, the Democrat mentioning 9-11 before the Republican did \u2013 and said that President Bush had missed an opportunity to rally Americans to a common cause and said he would at least ask people to think about their energy use. McCain mentioned spending cuts and didn't really engage with the question.</p> <p>The third came when Brokaw asked if healthcare was a privilege, a right or a responsibility. McCain chose responsibility, but he didn't say whose. Obama said it was a right. That position may not ultimately win a battle in Congress, but it will win a rhetorical match every time in the minds of swing voters.</p> <p>McCain had his moments. He perked up when the conversation shifted to foreign policy. He was better, in political terms, on Israel and Russia. But Obama stood his ground on the negotiate-with-our-enemies question, and for what it's worth, when he noted that the Bush administration's posture of refusing to talk with Iran and North Korea had pushed both of those nations toward more belligerent postures, the CNN needles were close to the positive roof.</p> <p>McCain's big gambit, of course, was the proposal, new and intended to make news, about the government buying up about $300 billion in bad mortgages. The reaction to think about here is on the right, which will see this as a second bailout. Let's track the outrage over the next two days. It's possible that McCain could lose significant parts of his intelligentsia base over this \u2013 or be forced to walk it back.</p> <p>And finally, the \"that one\" moment. It wasn't racial, to me. It was an old guy speaking slightly awkwardly. I'd bet, however, that black people will see it differently.</p> <p>But again, what was important here is what wasn't said. McCain needed to use this forum to establish a theme about Obama's character. He wasn't able to do it. He and Sarah Palin will go back out on the campaign trail tomorrow and start talking again about Bill Ayers. Obama will go out and talk about the exact same things he talked about in this debate. That's the difference between a campaign that's shooting from the hip and one that's keeping to a game plan. It's no wonder that the gap is slowly widening.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/aug/20/thewatchmenthestorysofar\">film adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' graphic novel Watchmen</a> has been on the cards since the comic book hit the newsstands more than two decades ago. Finally, last year, the stars aligned: reckoning that superhero movies are reliably bankable these days, a major studio (Warner Bros) turned to a director with a hugely profitable comic-book adaptation under his belt (300's Zack Snyder) and gave him the money and creative freedom to put his vision of Watchmen on screen.</p> <p>Even after shooting wrapped earlier this year, however, studio wrangling cast doubt on whether the picture would actually reach the multiplexes. Its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/03/watchmen1\">March 2009 release</a> now looks secure but both the film's corporate backers and the graphic novel's many ardent admirers await its release with more than usual anticipation: the former have an estimated $120m (\u00a368m) riding on a convoluted fantasy flick that currently clocks in at two-and-three-quarter hours; the latter are anxious to see justice done to a universally recognised landmark in its field, one of the first stories to apply political and psychological realism to superhero lore.</p> <p>At a press screening at New York's Time Warner centre on Monday night, Snyder presented around half an hour of footage from his film \u2013 footage that suggests he cleaves as closely to Moore and Gibbons' work here as he did to Frank Miller's in 300, more or less treating the graphic novel as a storyboard. To admirers of the source material, it's a more welcome tack than the clumsy reshaping that resulted in cinematic travesties of Moore's From Hell, V for Vendetta and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. On the other hand, it's an approach that flirts with camp and aesthetic redundancy.</p> <p>Snyder's commitment to replicating the graphic novel's universe was evident even before the screening: an adjacent room housed painstakingly recreated costumes and designs from the film, and props instantly recognisable to Watchmen fans such as a pirate-themed comic-book, a battered journal and a blood-spattered smiley-face badge.</p> <p>The first bit screened was the opening 12 minutes of the picture, comprising the death of Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), aka costumed vigilante turned government operative the Comedian, and a credit sequence laying out the alternate 20th-century history against which the story takes place. Blake's pummelling at the hands of a masked intruder exhibits the mix of wham-bam and slo-mo action familiar from 300, while the potted history, set to Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin', interweaves \"masked avengers\" with Hiroshima, JFK and Warhol. Think Zelig with capes, or Forrest Gump in spandex.</p> <p>There was also an action sequence in which the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) spring the borderline-psychotic gumshoe Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) from jail during a riot. It was punchy in more ways than one, and offered a glimpse of Rorschach's mask, reminiscent of the ink-blot tests after which he's named, in fluid motion, one of few instances where the film offers an effect impossible on the page.</p> <p>In another section, Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup) teleports to the surface of Mars, where he mulls his personal history. The story's only truly super-powered being, Manhattan gains godlike power over matter and space-time after being caught in an experiment; the character is the vehicle for Watchmen's most trenchant interrogations of how superhumans might actually be used by governments (basically, as weapons). The sequence is an impressive translation of Moore and Gibbons' work, from memorable images like a cold glass of beer to Manhattan's painful first rematerialisation after the accident as a blue humanoid. Like in the graphic novel \u2013 though unlike in the movie's trailer \u2013 he is both nude and anatomically correct, surely making this the first full-frontal superhero movie. He is also seen single-handedly winning Vietnam and rendering some nightclub hoodlums into Clive Barker-esque carcass-goop dripping from the ceiling.</p> <p>After the screening, Snyder and Gibbons took questions. The first was from a large, balding man in the fourth row. \"On behalf of the obese, obsessive geek community,\" he began, \"does the ending puss out?\" The story's conclusion is both cataclysmic and morally muddy. \"The ending does not puss out,\" Snyder replied, \"To me that's the point of the graphic novel.\" Gibbons noted that the movie's production is \"very timely. It stands in relation to the [recent cycle of] superhero movies as the graphic novel did to comic books at the time.\" And Snyder reported that he'd suggested the studio use a line of dialogue about Dr Manhattan \u2013 \"God exists, and he's American\" \u2013 as the movie's tagline. \"They weren't into that, by the way.\"</p> <p>When asked to describe the specific benefits of turning the story into a movie, however, Snyder offered a Sarah Palin-esque free association ramble. He concluded, defensively, that \"there's a rabid and vocal fan base for the graphic novel that support the graphic novel and are maybe against the movie. No Country for Old Men changed [its source material, the novel by Cormac McCarthy] three times as much as we have but I guarantee you there's no rabid fan base who are going to kill the Coens!\"</p> <p>Perhaps he should have changed it more. On the basis of the screened material, Snyder appears to deliver a faithful account of the graphic novel's words and images with the help of well-turned CGI and detailed production design. But fidelity seems an odd reason to go to all that trouble; if you aim only to replicate something, why not just stick with the original?</p> <p>Especially as, perhaps inevitably, something is lost in translation; what was resonant on the page feels somewhat plasticky and campy on screen. Maybe the serious superhero movie is simply a hiding to nothing. I was reminded of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/10/080310fa_fact_chabon\">Michael Chabon's intriguing argument</a> that \"the superhero costume is, by definition, an impossible object. It cannot exist\" in the real world, can only seem silly because its true purpose is \"the depiction of the naked human form, unfettered, perfect, and free\". So, all right, Dr Manhattan gets a pass, but the rest of the lineup are doomed to look unconvincing. Then again, the silliness of costumed adults was something the original graphic novel addressed. Come March \u2013 legal wrangles permitting \u2013 we'll be able to judge the entire movie. Until then, the Watchmen go unwatched.</p>"
