  "<p>Homophobia is rife in British football, and supporters, the clubs and the Professional Footballers Association, (PFA), the players' trade union appear to tolerate it. Every year the Football Association promises to stamp on clubs for anti-gay abuse. And every year that abuse keeps coming. But there are signs of change. On Thursday night at the FA's headquarters in Soho Square, <a href=\"http://www.kickitout.org/index.php\">Kick It Out</a>, football's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/equality\">equality</a> and inclusion campaign, hosted a summit meeting to look at ways of beating the abusers.</p> <p>On the panel was veteran gay rights campaigner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/petertatchell\">Peter Tatchell</a>, who has just joined the FA's anti-homophobia working group. Tatchell said the FA had to take positive action. His idea: recruit half a dozen premiership players to appear in an \"MTV-style\" pop video speaking out against homophobia and racism and misogyny. \"Show it on TV and at football grounds all over the country - the impact would be enormous,\" he told the meeting.</p> <p>Jason Bartholomew Hall is one of the organisers of the Justin Fashanu Campaign, which wants the FA and Fashanu's former clubs to commemorate the 11th anniversary of Fashanu's death in May next year. Fashanu, who hung himself in a lock-up garage, remains Britain's only openly gay footballer, an admission for which he received years of abuse from fans and fellow players.</p> <p>\"We haven't really moved on in the 10 years since Justin's death. There isn't anyone in football in the UK or worldwide that is out,\" Bartholomew Hall said. \"I worry that if a player came out the backlash would be horrible and simply drive more gay players underground. It could be professional suicide. Clubs wouldn't want you to do it.\"</p> <p>Former pro Paul Elliott, who played for Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Italian club Bari and is now special advisor to the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, feels there is a momentum building just as the anti-racism movement built in the 1970's and 1980's. He knows of dozens of professionals who are gay but would never come out in the current climate.</p> <p>He said: \"It's a combination of fear and a lack of stakeholder engagement from key people like the PFA to ensure they are supported. That's the key thing. I have spoken to dozens of players who feel this. They are also concerned about implications professionally and socially \u2013 they have nice lifestyles.\"</p> <p>Lucy Faulkner, the FA's well-liked head of equality and diversity, stressed the FA's new chairman, Lord Triesman, wants to tackle homophobia - as he told a meeting of Supporters Direct only a day earlier.</p> <p>Faulkner was asked by the panel host, Radio 5 Live's Bob Ballard, why the FA did not show an example by laying down the law to Chelsea coach Phil Scolari. Scolari denies he is homophobic but has gone on record in the past as saying he would throw anyone out of his team if he found out they were gay. </p> <p>She said: \"It's a question for clubs like Chelsea as employers to make it known to employees that this is unacceptable. We would not do anything about past events but if it happened in future he could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute.\"</p> <p>Faulkner said the FA's coaching accreditation included elements on diversity and equality and the message that all forms of intolerance are unacceptable was at the heart of the Respect Campaign \u2013 which ostensibly targets abuse of referees. And she said there are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/aug/27/gayrights.football\">good examples of clubs</a>, including Manchester City, Aston Villa and Brighton and Hove Albion, setting up gay supporters clubs.</p> <p>Bartholomew Hall said abusive clubs need to be hit where it hurts fans and bosses most \u2013 by docking points. Faulkner said this was already within the FA's power but had not been used. Most of the panel and audience agreed with Tatchell, who wanted guilty clubs to lose points and if needs be to play to empty stands as extra punishment. He said: \"It would create peer pressure. Fans around would tell abusers they were ruining it for everyone.\"</p>",
  "<p>The idea of announcing the prices of the players as well the names never seems more appropriate than in the Champions League, a competition of severe contrasts. Celtic come to Old Trafford tonight with the \u00a34m Scott Brown as their most expensive signing. Manchester United have 11 players who cost as much or more, up to the \u00a330.75m Dimitar Berbatov. This is no sob story since many renowned clubs have less money than Celtic. </p> <p>From manager's office to boardroom, the Scottish champions are run by smart people. With turnover at \u00a375m, the debt of \u00a33.5m is modest. The trouble is that revenue can only stay at those levels if Celtic go on featuring in the Champions League. They have been pulling off that feat under Gordon Strachan.</p> <p>Having never before reached the knockout phase of the tournament in its modern form, the manager has guided them there in each of the last two years. The odds are against a continuation of the sequence, considering Celtic's agonised away form and a 0-0 draw with Aalborg in Glasgow at the start of Group E. Nonetheless, Strachan has achieved much, including three league titles, and part of that success has come through imaginative moves.</p> <p>As with any manager, there were signings that failed, but occasional disappointments can always be overshadowed by a single brilliant coup. Unable to compete with many English clubs, Strachan has excelled by identifying people who would have been ruled out as potential signings for the Premier League. In the case of Shunsuke Nakamura Celtic turned to a well-known individual who had been written off many times.</p> <p>Indeed, Martin Greig's revealing book The Zen of Naka (Mainstream, \u00a316.99) is a chronicle of rejections surmounted. The author, digging deep into the Japanese background, shows us Nakamura in his early teens, crying not because he had been left out of his team but because he had failed to contribute to its success. Soon after, Yokohama Marinos edged him out of their youth system but the midfielder then made his name in schools football instead.</p> <p>When he had ultimately become established with Yokohama in the J League, Philippe Troussier nonetheless overlooked the midfielder for the 2002 World Cup because he reasoned that Nakamura lacked the stamina essential in a Japan line-up designed for defence. The player's reaction was to attempt to improve himself with a move to Italy.</p> <p>His delicate skills made him a misfit in a glum Reggina line-up that survived in Serie A despite scoring a mere 36 goals in the 2004-05 season. Even relegated Brescia were more prolific. That summer, though, Strachan was fascinated by what he saw on television of Nakamura's influence for Japan at the Confederations Cup.</p> <p>His focus, crucially, was on all that Nakamura could do, rather than his limitations. Celtic, in any case, lack the budget to deal in perfection. He cost around \u00a31m, but Celtic were wise enough to pay at least as much again for his image rights. The Champions League stage has made him such a star in his homeland that four Japanese journalists are based in Glasgow simply to report on his every deed.</p> <p>That band of reporters has to be patient because it is Nakamura's habit to go to the gym for up to an hour after home games. He is obsessive on the training ground too, grooving his free-kicks, with his interpreter between the posts, after everyone else has gone. The Celtic manager has written that in terms of sheer ability Nakamura is the best footballer he has ever worked with. There are, of course, additional qualities lacking in him that someone such as Strachan's former Scotland team-mate Kenny Dalglish had in spades.</p> <p>Strachan does not feel that Nakamura would have been suited to the relentlessness of the Premier League and calculates that La Liga might have been the right setting. As it is, the 30-year-old, with his family in mind, may well have his wish granted to return to Yokohama in January should Celtic's interest in the Champions League be over.</p> <p>Two years ago he sent Celtic to the last 16 of the tournament with a free-kick winner against United that an expert such as Matt Le Tissier ranks as being among the five greatest set-piece goals he has seen, if not the best of all.</p> <p>It is unlikely that the visitors will savour tonight's game. Perhaps the action will stay far out of Nakamura's reach. Nevertheless, exploits such as his acquisition and that of the maverick goalkeeper Artur Boruc have kept Celtic to the fore. Strachan's stiff challenge is to go on identifying undervalued assets that are beneath the notice of more affluent clubs.</p>",
  "<p>A few miles inland from the north coast of Sicily, on a bare and rocky plateau about 2,000ft up in the Madonie mountains, there is a crossroads called the Bivio Polizzi. If you are coming from the town of Caltavuturo on the route of the old Targa Florio, you ignore the right fork, which would take you to the small hill town of Polizzi Generosa, and bear left on the road that leads to the sea. Back in 1973, which was the last time the race was run, you could stand on a grass bank at the crossroads on a practice day and hear the sound of a car long before it came into view. Then you watched it snaking through a series of bends before it passed you, a blur of noise and colour so close that you could almost reach out across a ditch and touch it.</p> <p>The circuit was 45 miles long, and sometimes there were extended silences between the cars. On that day 35 years ago I was standing at the crossroads with a group of locals, waiting for the next competitor. Suddenly the lull was broken by a sound like a distant hornet, rising and falling. We cocked our ears, and within a few seconds one of my companions uttered a single word: \"Lancia!\"</p> <p>A few seconds later a dot appeared on the horizon, about a mile away, before turning first into a motor car and then into the futuristic wedge shape of a Lancia Stratos, painted in the red and white colours of a well known brand of American cigarettes. But to at least one pair of ears the sound of its 2.4litre V6 engine was as identifiable as its distinctive bodywork.</p> <p>Racing engines used to have a kind of musical quality, individual and collective. A V8 Cosworth barked, a Matra V12 was so loud as it passed the pits at peak revs that it actually hurt the unprotected eardrums, and a 12-cylinder Ferrari sang an octave above everything else. Together they made a symphony. In the turbocharged era a V6 Porsche whispered and a four-cylinder BMW rumbled. There was a season at the beginning of the present decade when the exhaust of the Mercedes V10 engine used by McLaren was tuned in such a way as to produce a sustained scream that seemed to express the car's sheer joy at being alive. </p> <p>All that disappeared when formula one's governing body decreed several years ago that in the cause of reducing costs every team's engines had to share a single configuration - first V10, currently V8. Out went engineering ingenuity and the sort of experimentation that occasionally led to technical breakthroughs - and the glorious polyphony disappeared along with it. Now all the engines sound the same.</p> <p>And then, last week, our old pal Max Mosley took time off from his battle to establish a new privacy law to announce a proposal to make all the formula one teams use a common engine design. So not only will they sound the same, they will actually be the same, made in the same factory. At first glance, this seems like a terrible idea. And the longer you look at it, the worse it gets.</p> <p>To those who love motor racing, the sport has always been about the combination of man and machine. The engineering is of as much interest, both technical and aesthetic, as the driver's style at the wheel or competitive behaviour. Formula one is about competition at every level, starting with the engines. Enzo Ferrari wasn't interested in who drove his cars, or how they looked. What he cared about was the piece of engineering that lay beneath the bonnet: the heart of a car, as well as its voice. The likes of BMW and Honda, using the sport to enhance the high-tech image of their road vehicles, are likely to respond by walking away - which, given their recent opposition to Mosley, may not be seen by the governing body as an entirely unwelcome development.</p> <p>Green measures such as Mosley's forthcoming energy-recovery system may help motor racing survive in a more critical era. But to take the engine out of the grand prix equation is to stop its heartbeat.</p> <p><strong>Aerial exchanges a poor alternative to running rugby</strong></p> <p>Perhaps Wasps have only themselves to blame for a dreadful start to the season in which the coaches have chosen four different players at full-back without finding one who can catch the ball. But whoever framed the experimental law variations can take some of the responsibility for turning a handling game into one in which kicking for position is assuming a primary role.</p> <p>You could see it coming in the early stages of last year's Rugby World Cup and occasionally it paid unsightly dividends, as when Bernard Laporte's France managed to nullify the superior all-round game of the All Blacks by hoisting the ball into the air at every opportunity. Now an apparently spontaneous strategic trend seems to have been enshrined in laws that make it more profitable to indulge in reciprocal fusillades of mortar fire than to run through the sort of handling phases recognised by most enthusiasts as the basis of entertaining and progressive rugby.</p> <p>Experimental variations have a way of becoming permanent. These changes, however, need to be resisted as firmly as possible.</p> <p><strong>Guilty pleasure as corporate pariahs get comeuppance</strong></p> <p>Martin Brundle's pre-race grid walks are seldom short of embarrassing moments, but the most toe-curling of all came at the floodlit race in Singapore last month when he spied the American woman in charge of grand prix sponsorship for the Dutch bank ING and asked if she was enjoying herself. \"Doesn't our logo look great in the lights?\" she chirped, summing up in a single phrase the ghastliness of the contemporary formula one paddock experience. So I'm afraid a flicker of a smile sprang to my lips yesterday when I heard that ING is about to be bailed out by the Dutch government to the tune of several million pounds. Or possibly billion. Who knows, these days? Except Bernie Ecclestone, of course.</p> <p><strong>Supporters display their gracious side</strong></p> <p>Leaving the capital of Belarus after England's victory last week, our coach passed the imposing obelisk in Victory Square, erected in recognition of the nomination of Minsk as one of 12 \"hero cities\" of the Soviet Union, deemed to have played a special role in the Great Patriotic War. After more than half of Minsk's inhabitants had been killed during the three-year occupation, the city became a centre of partisan activity leading up to the 1944 liberation. Placed at the foot of the monument was a handsome floral tribute in the form of the flag of St George, placed by the official England supporters' group. A graceful gesture; good for them.</p> <p><strong>Single-cell organisms offer lesson for Spurs</strong></p> <p>During a fascinating item on amoebas in yesterday's Today programme, an eminent scientist described findings from the latest research. At school, we were taught to view these single-cell organisms as the most basic form of life. Now it turns out that they are capable of cooperative activity, linking up to create collective structures and sharing a means of communication. If amoebas can do it, why can't Tottenham Hotspur?</p>",
  "<p>I went to Villa Park to watch England against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wales\">Wales Under-21s</a> with an open mind to see how good Wales were, considering they had finished above France in their European Championship qualifying group. One player who caught my eye was Simon Church. I had heard very little about him but was impressed by his return of three goals in Wales's two-legged play-off against an England side who had conceded only one goal in the whole of their campaign.</p> <p>He is a very good finisher, an ability encapsulated by Wales's second goal when what might have appeared to the layman as a simple finish was in fact a well timed run and execution that had to be dug out very quickly after Church realised that the goalkeeper had closed him down. Being able to adapt in so little time is the sign of a natural goalscorer. </p> <p>That was far from the only strength to his game as he showed a willingness to work in defence. When Aaron Ramsey released himself from his advanced central-midfield role to close down one of the centre-halves on the ball, Church moved to look after the left-back nice and early so that he was not required to chase out of position.</p> <p>He always tried to read the opposition defence when they were in possession, looking to exploit potential mistakes. Indeed he almost succeeded on two occasions, coming within a whisker of getting on the end of two short back-passes. He surprised the two centre-halves with a decent leap, showing he can more than hold his own in that department, and for someone whom you would not class as a target man his first touch and hold-up play were not bad. </p> <p>He worked well off his partner on the night, Sam Vokes, going directly in behind the flick-ons but making angles when Vokes had time to pick him out. He was a willing option for his winger when his team-mate was faced up by two opponents and he was quick to get in the box when he was one-on-one. His positioning and judgment of a cross coming in was good, borne out twice in a melee of players when he popped up with two headers at goal. </p> <p>However, for all his good play around the pitch it is the box where he comes alive and feels most comfortable. This was best summed up when he received a ball surrounded by three English players: in a tight area he controlled, turned, jinked again when he couldn't get his shot off, cut between two defenders and shot just wide. He did, however, get a dressing down from his manager, Brian Flynn, when the best cross of the night skidded across goal but he was nowhere to be seen, having switched off after the build-up.</p> <p>This is a player who has yet to make a first-team appearance for his parent club, Reading, but has been loaned out to Crewe, Yeovil and Wycombe where he has managed one goal in 22 appearances. For Wales he has seven goals in 10, which makes me wonder why he has not made more of an impression at club level. This is a mystery to me - his is surely a career waiting to happen.</p> <h2>How he rates</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 19</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> High Wycombe</p> <p><strong>Position</strong> Striker</p> <p><strong>Height</strong> 6ft </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 13st 4lb</p> <p><strong>From</strong> Youth team</p> <p><strong>Pace</strong> 8/10</p> <p><strong>Heading</strong> 8/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting</strong> 9/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 8/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a3300,000</p>",
  "<p>It was on a family holiday to the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida that the new science minister, Lord Drayson, really understood the power that astronauts have to inspire. \"The tour guide asked all the children aged between eight and 15 to put their hands up. She said that they were eligible to join the Nasa astronaut programme to fly to Mars,\" he says. His five kids were captivated. \"Now my 11-year-old daughter wants to be an astronaut.\"</p> <p>Despite the British government's decades-long objection to funding human spaceflight, Drayson is now convinced of the value of a UK astronaut programme. And as the Guardian first revealed shortly after Gordon Brown's October 4 cabinet reshuffle, Paul Drayson intends to reverse that ban.</p> <p>\"When I was a young boy, I was inspired by those great science projects. In 1969, when men first landed on the moon, I was nine. It was fantastic the first time Concord flew. Those things made a big difference to me, they made me want to be involved in science and technology,\" says Drayson, who is also a top-flight racing driver. \"The government is going through a review at the moment of our space policy and I don't want to pre-judge that review. [But] iconic projects are part of the key to [inspiring young people] and so I want to make sure that in this review that value is fully taken into account.\"</p> <p>Drayson is a highly unusual figure in politics. He took the prime minister's call inviting him into government while on a race track in Atlanta, where he was preparing to compete in the latest leg of the American Le Mans series in his biofuel-driven Aston Martin - numbered 007. The life peer has been in government before as defence procurement minister, but he quit to pursue his dream of competing in the Le Mans 24-hour race in June next year. With the whine of race cars travelling at up to 200mph in the background, Brown agreed that Drayson could continue his racing career as long as it did not interfere with his ministerial responsibilities. Brown has upgraded the science minister post to a cabinet position and given Drayson the chairmanship of a cabinet committee on science and innovation. Drayson will also sit on the new National Economic Council.</p> <p><strong>City rocket scientists</strong></p> <p>That will give him more influence over economic decision-making than previous science ministers, but Drayson says the financial crisis and the loss of banking jobs from the City would offer opportunities as well as threats. \"When I was running a biotechnology company, I kept on losing some of my best scientists to the City, attracted by the better pay,\" says Drayson. \"With the turmoil that we've seen lately, now is a great time for people who have been trained in science to come back to science, whether it is to start up a science-based business or to come and teach science. If I was a City rocket scientist, now is the time to come back and do some real rocket science.\"</p> <p>He says one of his priorities will be tackling global warming. \"I believe that climate change is probably the most important challenge this generation faces. It's not a political fashion ... It is what the people want. Science clearly tells us that we have a major problem. The clock is ticking. We need to get on with it,\" he says. Drayson's race car runs on cellulosic bioethanol, a fuel that is not derived from crop plants, so circumventing the arguments about food versus fuel. But his family car collection reportedly includes two Aston Martins and a Lotus Elan, and he has no plans to have a government-issue, low-emission Toyota Prius.</p> <p>Drayson - whose full title is Baron Drayson of Kensington in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea - grew up near Brands Hatch race track and is a self-confessed \"car nut\". After maths, chemistry and physics A-levels, he studied engineering at Aston University (\"I really wanted to make things\") before continuing to complete a PhD in robotics there in 1985. \"For the first time in my life I was my own boss. I discovered that I loved that feeling,\" he says.</p> <p>He loved it so much that he left research to become a science entrepreneur. In 1993, he co-founded the hugely successful company Powderject Pharmaceuticals, which became the sixth largest vaccine-producing company in the world, with annual profits of \u00a325m. His business interests have netted Drayson a multimillion-pound fortune. He owns a house in London and a mansion (called Nether Lypiatt) in Gloucestershire that he reportedly bought for \u00a35.75m from Prince Michael of Kent. Drayson has used some of his wealth to pursue political goals. He has given more than \u00a3500,000 to the Labour party, sparking accusations that the donations were linked to the peerage Tony Blair granted him in 2004 and a \u00a332m government vaccine contract that Powderject won in 2002. Two inquiries cleared ministers and the company of any wrongdoing, and Drayson denies any allegation of sleaze.</p> <p>\"I think it is a public duty, actually, to support a political party,\" he says. \"I happen to believe that the values of the Labour party in terms of fairness and equality of opportunity are as relevant now in the 21st century as they've ever been.\" He says he will not make any donations to the party while he is a minister.</p> <p>Drayson says the post of science minister is his \"dream job in government\". In this respect he is more in the mould of the long-standing science minister Lord Sainsbury, who quit in 2004, than the two ministers who followed him, Malcolm Wicks and Dr Ian Pearson. Both hardly had time to get their feet under the desk and always looked as if they were on their way to another post. Phil Willis, a Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the House of Commons innovation, universities and skills select committee, says he could not see either Wicks or Pearson referring to the position as their \"dream job\".</p> <p><strong>Love of science</strong></p> <p>\"What excites me about Lord Drayson's appointment is that here is a minister who quite frankly does not have to be here,\" says Willis. \"He's taken this post because he loves science and he loves the translation of science into wealth creation. Since the days of Lord Sainsbury we've missed having a real heavyweight battling for science within government, and I think that has had a negative effect.\"</p> <p>Drayson's coat of arms is the only one in the House of Lords to include a DNA double helix and his family motto is \"seek knowledge\". Willis says that Drayson's passion for the subject stands out. \"He's an enthusiast. And the government is full of technocrats who don't have a vision, who don't have a passion for their briefs.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the private sector is ecstatic at his appointment. \"Now more than ever, having someone with a proven track record in both the business and scientific communities will be of the utmost importance ... It is essential the UK fully exploits its scientific base to ensure that it remains internationally competitive,\" said a spokesperson for the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. But academic scientists might feel nervous that blue-skies research will be cut in favour of more applied projects. Drayson rejects this. \"I'm going to be vigorously defending pure science,\" he says.</p> <p>Willis is not concerned that pure research will suffer. \"I don't have that worry. Remember that he also comes from the research science background himself. I think he understands full well that unless you actually generate the world-class, blue-skies science, you will not have anything to translate.\"</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age: </strong>48</p> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Science minister</p> <p><strong>Before that:</strong> Racing driver, defence procurement minister</p> <p><strong>Likes:</strong> racing cars, science, space flight, the Labour party</p> <p><strong>Married</strong> with five children</p>",
  "<p>Alan Shearer has offered a glimmer of hope to those, such as Sir Bobby Robson, who see him as the great redeemer who can lead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited\">Newcastle United </a>from the barren land in which they have recently been stranded.</p> <p>Asked about the golden recommendation recently offered by Robson, the former striker did not rule out the possibility that he will return to St James' Park as manager once the club are finally sold.</p> <p>\"Everyone knows I have done part of my coaching badges,\" he said. \"I have not done the pro licence yet, which is mandatory, but I will do it at some stage in the future. I have said it before and I will say it again, management interests me.\"</p> <p>Shearer, however, was careful not to be seen to be actively touting for a role currently filled, on a temporary basis, by Joe Kinnear. \"I cannot say I would be delighted to come here, because that would be wrong of me,\" he added. \"I can't say where it might happen and I can't say it would be here. Five days is a long time at this football club.\"</p> <p>Robson recently recommended Shearer to the club in glowing terms. \"Alan might not have any experience but he knows what the club is all about, he knows the supporters, he knows how they feel and he'd be dedicated to it, \" the former Newcastle manager said recently as he launched his new book. \"Alan will make a very good manager. He's got clout - he had that in the dressing room - he loved the club, he wanted everything right, he wanted training right, everything around the club right.\"</p> <p>Shearer was keen not to be seen to be further destabilising the club by laying out a manifesto for the job, with Newcastle currently up for sale and Kinnear bringing a fighting spirit to a team now low in the league. However, it is a state of affairs Shearer is adamant cannot last.</p> <p>\"No one can control what is going on off the pitch but we know the club is for sale and the sooner that is completed the better,\" he said. \"Until it is actually sold the club will struggle to go forward. The longer the club is standing still and no one knows what the future holds, the harder it will be to attract players. It is possible Joe could still be here in January but no player will want to come here while everything is up in the air. You can't expect a player to sign a three- or four-year contract while everything is so uncertain.</p> <p>\"They need to get through to January and get players. They have to try and consolidate. The FA Cup may give them a chance of something but it is very doubtful they will do well in the league now. So they have to write the league off and get some stability.\"</p> <p>Shearer also said that if he did go into management it would be on his own terms. The way Kevin Keegan was treated was not, he insisted, something he would tolerate. \"If it is right what has been reported and players were bought without his knowledge, he was right to do what he did. That seems to be an ongoing trend in our league, that other people apart from the manager are running the football club. Personally I don't think that system works in our league.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Crown Estate, holder of the Queen's property, has helped trigger a resurgence of interest for wind projects in the deep waters off Britain by promising to invest in projects at a time when schemes are struggling in the face of planning delays and other problems.</p> <p>The decision by the Crown Estate to pay up to half of all pre-construction development costs has brought a huge surge in applications for the latest round of licensing, with almost 100 companies wanting to build wind farms far into the North Sea.</p> <p>\"The Crown Estate offering to be a development partner takes away much of the cost and uncertainty with third-round projects, which is why we have seen so much interest in the latest licensing round,\" said Adam Bruce, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association, on the eve of its annual conference to be opened by Gordon Brown today.</p> <p>The organisation has also showed its willingness to be at the forefront of the battle against climate change recently by agreeing to buy the world's biggest wind turbine, the 7.5-megawatt Clipper Windpower MBE prototype, codenamed Project Britannia. The turbine, said to be powerful enough to provide power for 5,500 homes, is under construction in Blyth, Northumberland, and will be towed out and erected in the North Sea. </p> <p>Although deep-water projects are expensive, they could be far more efficient because they could utilise larger turbines and take advantage of stronger prevailing winds, said Bruce. \"Unlike onshore wind schemes, the operator is also only dealing with one planning regime and one landlord in the Crown Estate, which is now offering to be a partner.\"</p> <p>The organisation, which has responsibility for licensing the seabed up to 200 miles out for renewable projects, will help pay for the cost of undertaking studies on what impact plans would have on shipping and marine life. The cost of doing that will later be clawed back from revenues once the wind turbines are turning. </p> <p>Ninety-six companies expressed their interest by last month in becoming involved in the third licensing round, far more than in previous rounds. The Crown Estate is considering the offers and will make a firm decision on who will win the chance to proceed with schemes on 11 favoured zones.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Crown Estate said the response to the licensing round had \"greatly exceeded our expectations\". The body, which owns parts of Regent Street as well as 55% of Britain's foreshore, traces its history back to George III, who swapped much of his land for a fixed income from the Treasury. It is independent of the monarch and the government.</p> <p>The interest in deep-water projects is a welcome boost for the industry, which is still hobbled by problems that ministers have endlessly promised to sort out. </p> <p>A new planning bill is meant to streamline projects but the BWEA pointed out yesterday in a new review that half of the seven gigawatts of wind capacity stuck in the planning system is located in Scotland and not covered by the legislation and a further 3.5GW is represented by schemes below a 50-megawatt threshold.</p> <p>There are still difficulties with the ministry of defence and the aviation sector over the alleged threat to radar coverage posed by wind turbines. The government has again promised to bang heads together to prevent this delaying schemes but problems remain.</p> <p>\"It is currently not possible to quantify the risk to a project from an aviation perspective,\" says the BWEA. \"The objections cannot be easily predicted, and a pre-planning statement of no objection is not always valid through the planning process.\"</p> <p>The prime minister will reiterate his determination to clear any logjams and ensure wind farming reaches its potential. Brown will say that his decision to create a new self-standing energy and climate change department is proof of how seriously he takes global warming and energy security. </p> <p>The Carbon Trust will today announce that it has reached agreement with five major energy companies under which \u00a330m will be invested in finding ways to reduce the cost of offshore wind by at least 10%. </p> <p>Airtricity, ScottishPower Renewables and StatoilHydro will work with RWE Innogy and Dong Energy to research and develop ways of cutting costs and improving efficiency at wind farms at a time of mounting concern that rising costs are chasing investors away from renewables.</p> <p>The move comes only days after the Carbon Trust, an organisation established by government to help speed up the introduction of clean energy, published a report showing that the government would fail to meet its offshore-wind goals unless a variety of measures were introduced. Among the proposals was that permission be given to develop a new generation of wind farms much closer to shore.</p>",
  "<p>A peculiar thing happens when Margaret Lund's former colleagues talk about her time as head of Shakespeare primary school in Fleetwood. They start by energetically singing her praises, and they end up crying. Virtually to a woman, as they describe what working with her has meant to them, just a few minutes in and eyes have gone shiny with tears and there's a quick grab for the box of tissues on the table. </p> <p>\"It's like Cinderella. She transformed me from a dinner lady to a teacher with my own classroom full of children and my name on the door,\" says Paula Haughton. \"From a modest upbringing where university was for other people and going into an office job, as I did at 16, was seen as doing well, she changed everything. My graduation, after she'd encouraged me through all the qualifications I needed to get to university, was one of the best days of my life. And now I've got the chance to do a job I love.\" She sniffs hard, gives a big teary smile and dabs her eyes. </p> <p>\"I didn't have very good memories of education,\" recalls her colleague, teacher Wendy Mather, whose contact with Shakespeare primary started 14 years ago as a parent helper. \"Which meant I couldn't think of anything worse than being a teacher. But Margaret encouraged me, even before I was ever employed here, to do different courses and get involved. And then I started to enjoy coming into school, and became a teaching assistant, and I thought, oh, me a teaching assistant, that's me made! But then Margaret would search out other opportunities, and she encouraged me to do a specialist teaching assistant course through the Open University. She's changed me. I used to be quite a fiery, anti-establishment person, and now, to be a teacher with a class of 30 children and to love them, well...\" Mather's cheeks have suddenly gone very pink and she's blinking hard despite the huge beam spreading across her face. </p> <p>Fleetwood, where Lund lived and worked for 32 years until her retirement last summer, was once a busy fishing port on Lancashire's west coast. That industry has disappeared and it's now a typical northern seaside town where people struggle to find employment. </p> <p>Schools here have to fight hard to give children a sense of belief in a better future. It has been Lund's determination to ensure that \"Shakespeare children\" as they're known in the town - and their parents, support staff and teachers - get every opportunity to experience the high of achieving their best that, says Deborah Tripp, the school's business manager, marks her out as an exceptional leader. </p> <p>\"As she came up to retirement, I looked back at everything she's done, not only here, but her commitment to helping people achieve throughout the community, and the endless hours she spends working for Rotary International, for example, and I felt she deserved it,\" says Tripp, who nominated Lund for the award. </p> <p>What are the personal qualities that have marked her out? </p> <p><strong>Developing potential</strong></p> <p>\"The way she sees and draws out the children's - and everyone's - potential,\" says Tripp. \"And the friendship, encouragement and commitment she offers to the people around her. She really enjoys what she does, so it's not a chore, and that comes across. And she has a very supportive family who are included in everything she does. Her husband is often referred to as a staff member!\" </p> <p>Susan Bartlett, the head who took over from Lund, was initially recruited by her in 1990. She stayed for 11 years, she says, \"because Margaret kept finding me new opportunities\", and then moved away to become head at another school. Having just returned to take up Lund's mantle, she observes that her former boss is \"very skilled at recognising individual talents. And of course, it's selfless, because she brings people on and she knows that as they develop and aspire to new things, she may well lose them.\" </p> <p>Managing a large team doesn't always mix easily with being a friend to your staff: many senior managers fight shy of combining the two. But Lund seems to have found a way of integrating inspirational leadership with caring personal relationships. </p> <p>\"We work really hard, but we've spent, as staff, such a lot of time having fun together,\" says Mather. \"My husband is amazed that I spend 50 hours a week here, and after that I'm off round to Margaret's.\" </p> <p>Lund's skills as a manager, whose passion lies in bringing out the abilities of everyone she comes into contact with, may well be explained by her own background. One of six children from a family that was far from well-off, she was made to leave her grammar school at 16 by her mother, \"who said I'd had a year more than my brothers and it was time I got a job\". She had just six O-levels to her name. </p> <p>She went into - and swiftly came out of - an ordinary office job, and then became a laboratory assistant, first in a school, and then, when it opened nearby, at Lancaster University. It was there she met her husband, who, together with university staff, encouraged her to restart her own education. She gained her teaching certificate at 22 and combined motherhood with an increasingly successful school career. But she is keenly aware that her story could have been very different, and often was for clever girls from a similar background to her own. And despite her achievements and the high esteem in which she's held in school and in her community, she is, she says, still waiting to be \"found out\". </p> <p>\"I still always feel I've got to prove myself,\" she explains with a rueful smile. It's a telling insight into her personal motivation, and also remarkable that a woman who is held in such regard by her colleagues, governing body, union and national government (which she has advised) still feels this way, never mind be willing to admit as much. </p> <p>\"It's a self-esteem thing - I'm always waiting for someone to say, very sternly, 'Margaret Marchment, you're that scruffy kid who had headlice, aren't you?' and I'll be going, 'oh yes, oh dear, you're right, I'm a fraud!'\" she says. </p> <p>It's because of this vulnerability that she can relate so empathically to others who also experience it, says Carolyn Thackway, deputy head at the school. </p> <p>\"Margaret was 'mum' and loved the children and all of us, but kept us on the straight and narrow and wanted us to do our very best,\" she says. \"We were all, staff and pupils, always encouraged to try things, and if they didn't work, there was a 'no blame' culture. As a school, we've been at the forefront of many initiatives, but she's also given us the confidence to say, 'well, this worked for us, but this doesn't'. And what's happened here because of that is that parents have become very proud of this school, and we're known as the best school in Fleetwood. This school is like our family...\" Thackway breaks off. She's getting choked up, but laughs through it. </p> <p>Lund, too, is laughing through the beginning of tears. \"We cry a lot here,\" she says, unnecessarily, \"but we laugh a lot, too.\" Standing up for the best interests of the children has involved Lund in some controversy. When Sats were introduced, for example, she convened a meeting with parents to explain why she felt they would be detrimental to pupils: at the time, you were allowed to withdraw your child from sitting the tests and many Shakespeare parents did just that. </p> <p>\"And when it was decreed that children had to take them,\" says Lund with a note of naughty triumph in her voice, \"we were one of the last schools not to send our results to the local authority. I was determined to stand up for what we believed, even if we were standing alone.\" </p> <p>Standing up for her principles clearly matters greatly, evidenced by her 20 years as assistant secretary of the Lancashire county division of the NUT, which involved her in supporting numerous colleagues through industrial disputes. She's also been on the steering group of the Lancashire Teaching Agency, has been a member of the Lancashire Professional Development Consultative Committee and of the Arts Learning Consortium, North West, and has advised on education policy at national level. </p> <p>But when it comes down to it, it's a group of bright, beautifully behaved year 6 pupils, many of whom have known Lund all their school lives, who explain simply and best just how much she means to them, and how much she's missed. </p> <p><strong>Just like Santa</strong></p> <p>\"When she comes in now, it's like the feeling when Santa comes,\" says Briea Cheyne, aged 10. \"She's always so proud of us.\" \"She always comes to events if we're in them,\" says her classmate Jessica Taylor. \"It's really nice that she's there.\" </p> <p>\"She's just a really, really nice person,\" beams 10-year-old Billie Clark. \"Firm but fair,\" clarifies Briea. </p> <p>\"Yes, if you do something wrong, she doesn't keep on about it. Or shout. She talks to you, so you understand,\" explains Geoff Wylie, 10. \"She always says we're part of a family,\" says Briea. \"She's like the mother of our family, the Shakespeare family.\" </p> <p>It's the last of many times today that someone has used the word \"family\" in describing what Lund has built here. It seems a fitting testament to a woman who has so very thoroughly loved, nurtured and developed those who passed through her school in the two decades she was at its helm.</p> <p><strong>Ted Wragg award for lifetime achievement, sponsored by the Innovation Unit</strong></p> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Jane Ratcliff</strong>, King's Lodge school (West); <strong>Sue Jones</strong>, Haybridge high school and sixth form (West Midlands); <strong>Verity Silk</strong>, Cathays high (Wales); <strong>Hilary Green</strong>, Southbrook College (South-west); <strong>John Thompson</strong>, St Michael's CE primary (South); <strong>Ian Wilson</strong>, The Magna Carta school (South-east); <strong>Tom Stewart</strong>, Stranmillis primary (Northern Ireland); <strong>Margaret Lund</strong>, Shakespeare primary (North-west); <strong>Gloria Gott</strong>, St John's CE primary (North); <strong>Valerie Bell</strong>, Shotton Hall school (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Hugh Epstein</strong>, Richmond Upon Thames College (London); <strong>John Powell</strong>, Davenant foundation school (East); <strong>Lesley Turner</strong>, Little Hill primary (East Midlands); <strong>Michael Taylor</strong>, Dyce academy (Scotland)</p>",
  "<p>Tiny steps: that's the way. Today 15-year-old Max Nissim, supported by a harness, is making careful progress across the room. \"Good boy, that's the way. Good boy,\" encourages Anne Gough, winner of the special needs teacher of the year award.</p> <p>Persuading Max, who has limited hearing and sight, to leave his wheelchair and get on his feet is important; but what happens next is possibly even more important for a teenager with no speech. Gough hands Max a long yellow pole; he grips it and moves across the floor like a tightrope walker.</p> <p>When Max came to the Royal School for the Deaf and Communication Disorders in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, he held his hands permanently by his head. Now, if you will forgive the mixed metaphor, he is using his hands to take tiny steps that lead to a potential leap in his communication skills.</p> <p>\"We are doing a lot of therapy work to strengthen his shoulder muscles and develop his hand function,\" explains Gough, head of the school's sensory unit. Hence the yellow pole. \"We have encouraged him to use his hands to hold things, mouth them, work them out. And then he can begin to make choices, to reach for the things he wants. The longer-term aim is to develop some effective form of communication so that he can go through a bag and take out an object indicating something he would like.\"</p> <p>And so Max's fingers will help him be in touch with the world. The Royal School, founded by Manchester businessmen in 1823, used to teach only deaf children. Now its students often have a combination of hearing, visual, behaviour and learning disabilities, including autism. Their problems are some of the most severe the education system deals with.</p> <p>Gough joined the Royal School 14 years ago as a support assistant and moved on to teaching three years later after training to work with children with complex needs. \"I nominated her for the award because it's about time somebody did,\" says Lauren Haynes, who worked with Gough as a support assistant and then became a teacher herself. \"She is absolutely amazing in the way she works with colleagues, with other professionals, residents, parents, students themselves. She needs to be rewarded. And she needs to be cloned.\"</p> <p><strong>Unique ability</strong></p> <p>\"One runs out of superlatives after a while,\" adds Hilary Ward, the school's head. \"Anne has a unique ability to be able to get inside the heads of the youngsters. She can suss where they are at so that she can move them on to the next stage.\"</p> <p>The Teaching Awards judges reported that colleagues and parents describe Gough as \"a truly amazing human being\" and went on to discover for themselves that she is a gifted teacher who understands complex needs. \"Anne is constantly developing her expertise in order to meet the challenges of pupils,\" add the judges. \"She has an essential calming influence and ensures that everyone makes progress in their learning activities, even when this progress is against painstakingly small targets.\" It's those small steps again.</p> <p>Gough describes strategies that \"enable pupils to communicate and make some sense of a world that is incredibly difficult for them\". She trained first as a mainstream teacher but was always aware of the needs of her deaf brother, brought up at a time when deaf children were encouraged to speak rather than use sign language. Many children left school with no language so their literacy skills were very poor, and her brother and family suffered considerable frustration. \"I didn't want to see other children in that situation. So I think that inspired me to try to develop communication methods.\"</p> <p>At first she and other staff followed the national curriculum, teaching students in class groups while also trying to work on specific targets for each child. \"Students were in a classroom having lots of experiences thrown at them but not understanding what those experiences were. I felt very strongly that our starting point should be communication.</p> <p>\"And how can you teach communication unless someone is in a very interesting and exciting environment? If you are trying to teach a young child to speak, you don't talk about something really boring. You'll try to get them to communicate about what they want.\"</p> <p>Picking up on government moves in 2005 to allow a more personalised approach, Gough went to the head and suggested that each student should have his or her own tailormade learning programme. \"Instead of giving lessons adapted to meet individual needs, we went for a whole individual timetable based entirely on the student's needs.</p> <p>\"We would look initially at why the child wasn't communicating. Some of our children with more profound and multiple learning difficulties are not communicating because they have no means to do it. They don't have any functional control over their hands. They may have no vision, no hearing. So how do they communicate?\"</p> <p>The starting point, as with Max, is to help their physical development, give them some ability to have some intentional movement. </p> <p>Gough adds that the best way to encourage autistic children to communicate is to motivate them. \"Children who are autistic have no concept of what you are thinking, feeling. It's all about themselves. Once you know what motivates them, you can start to develop communication. We do that very simply through picture exchange or picture pointing.</p> <p>\"We take those children and put them in situations that are highly motivating, wait for the moment when they are so excited about something that they want to ask for it again. Then we show them the picture to help them request it again. We now have children who can tell us when they are hungry or in pain, and where it hurts.\"</p> <p><strong>Watch them smile</strong></p> <p>Still more tiny steps. It is, adds Gough, a fantastic feeling to help a child communicate effectively with his or her parents for the first time, to express what he or she wants. \"All these kids are amazing, really. You take a child who has very limited sensory awareness, as all our children have, and watch them every day and see them smile and get pleasure out of things. That's a kick for all of us. You have to keep moving and it's enthusiasm that drives you on. No book has been written about these children. There is no text book. So you are learning all the time, constantly trying something new. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</p> <p>\"I think I'm thoroughly addicted. It's the best job on the planet.\" Ward ruefully concedes that the new individual approach \"costs us an arm and a leg because for every child we have to have a learning support assistant to deliver the programme\". But it works and, inspired by Gough, three assistants have gone on to become teachers - including Haynes.</p> <p>\"Anne always looks so content when she is working with the students,\" says Haynes. \"Her determination, motivation and passion just shine through.\"</p> <h2>Award for special needs teacher of the year </h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Gill Fletcher</strong>, Tile Hill Wood school and language college (West Midlands); <strong>Neil Purcell</strong>, High Street primary (Wales); <strong>John Davies</strong>, Combe Pafford school (South-west); <strong>Freya Newberry</strong>, Ringwood school (South); <strong>Phil Martin</strong>, Goldwyn community special school (South-east); <strong>Allison Murphy</strong>, Knockbreda primary (Northern Ireland); <strong>Anne Gough</strong>, Royal School for the Deaf and Communication Disorders (North-west); <strong>Lesley Elsdon</strong>, Raincliffe school (North); <strong>Judith Reed</strong>, West Jesmond primary (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Louise Dunton</strong>, The Harefield academy (London); <strong>Claire Asher</strong>, Anthony Curton primary (East); <strong>Neil Amos</strong>, Derrymount school (East Midlands)</p>",
  "<p>Inside the rainbow nurturing room at Woodlands primary in Birkenhead, the walls are covered with photographs of the children, busy at work and smiling. There's a large paper rainbow at the centre. \"Mrs Skillen gives me stickers,\" reads one of the messages in a child's handwriting. Cuddly toys are dotted around the room; Mozart is playing soothingly in the background. A large corner sofa is the focus of the room, by the school desks. The room is a haven of calm in what can be some troubled young lives.</p> <p>Gill Lindfield, the headteacher at Woodlands primary for six years, nominated Mandy Skillen for the teaching assistant of the year award. \"She is absolutely amazing,\" Lindfield says. \"I have never worked with anybody like her.\" She says Skillen's positive work has pervaded the whole school and has even won over the sceptics. Not only a teaching assistant and nurturer, she is a governor and is in charge of the lunchtime supervisors.</p> <p>\"She has been at the school for 20-odd years, she cares genuinely, is non-judgmental and wants the best for the children.\" Lindfield remembers one child who kicked off and wouldn't come to school. Skillen told him he could come to school in his pyjamas or uniform. \"He never did that again,\" Lindfield says. </p> <p>Skillen also has contacts with other agencies, including mental health teams who can work with the most vulnerable children. Parents and children know where she lives, and some children have even been known to visit her at home. Self-effacing, she was absolutely mortified to be nominated for the award and was overwhelmed by emotion.</p> <p>Her link with the school began when her five children, now aged 20 to 28, attended and she became involved in the PTA, of which she is still an active member. One of her daughters, Rachel, works at Woodlands. \"I don't think I realised how demanding the nurture class would be emotionally,\" Skillen admits. She had a child who, for six to eight months, would communicate only by standing at the opposite side of the room writing messages on a notepad or whiteboard because he didn't want to speak. \"In the end he would sit and talk to me, but it took a long time.\"</p> <p><strong>Touching lives</strong></p> <p>A parent told the judges: \"In life you meet people who are able to touch the hearts of others, who genuinely care and instil confidence and security with positive guidance, and yet seem totally unaware. Mrs Skillen is one of these people\".</p> <p>Another parent was facing homelessness and the very real prospect of her son being taken into care. But Skillen stored her belongings under the sandpit in the rainbow room and helped her to find a new home. Her son is now settled. \"He used to say [to Skillen]: 'I wish my Mum was like you,' she says. \"He calls me Mum now.\" She told the judges: \"Without her I would probably not be here and I would certainly not have my son with me.\"</p> <p>On a typical day, Skillen will have circle time, where the children pass around a pebble and talk about how they are feeling. Some children call in for a cup of tea and a biscuit and she says it is often amazing what they reveal to her. There are albums of photographs for the children to pore over. </p> <p>She says for some children it can be difficult when the summer or Christmas holidays are looming, as they love school so much and the support and stability it gives them: \"You should have seen the year 6 boys last summer, sat here sobbing their hearts out - really tough boys. One of my regular visitors asked me: 'How am I going to cope without you?'\"</p> <p>Skillen set up the nurture class in 2004 and at the time there were a number of children in danger of exclusion. In the past three years, however, no children have been permanently excluded.</p> <p>Woodlands is in the heart of one of the most socially and economically deprived areas in the UK. \"We have very high numbers of very vulnerable families,\" Lindfield says. \"There are a lot of very young families, private landlords and drugs issues, which cause a lot of stress for parents. \"Mandy goes and gets these kids from home if she needs to and removes one of the barriers to learning. It has made a huge difference. The fact that children are in school means the parents are more relaxed and they engage with us more.\"</p> <p>Wendy Sharples, a year 2 teacher, has noticed the difference Skillen has made. \"She tends to take children in year 1 and by the time they come to me they have the language and vocabulary to talk about what they are feeling. Whereas normally these children would become frustrated and make life difficult for everyone, they are now able to talk about how they are feeling. She gives them security and confidence so they are able to start learning.\"</p> <p>Sharples says children can sometimes slip back, but when they do they are able to deal with it because of the work her colleague has done with them. \"Mandy does circle time with them and they can talk about their worries, problems and fears. Sadly, we don't have time as teachers, with all the pressures and 30 children in a class.\" Skillen's ethos has permeated through the school and she has encouraged the dinner-time supervisors to adopt a nurturing attitude.</p> <p>A child whom she has helped says of Skillen: \"She is always helpful and when I have been upset she has always let me come and speak to her. My mum's boyfriend used to have arguments with her that made me scared and worried. I didn't like coming to school because I didn't like leaving her. Now I come here for a hug and I feel better and a lot happier.\"</p> <p>Tom, in year 4, says: \"She is really nice and always helps me with my anger. I used to get into fights in year 2 and I was always dead angry. I would hit people, kick them and call them names. Now I count up to 10 if I get angry and I don't get into fights. I get into trouble a bit, but not as much.\"</p> <p>Another girl, Nicole, says Skillen was helpful after her dad died. \"I would come and talk to her and she helped me do a book about him. When something goes wrong, she is always there straight away.\"</p> <h2>TDA award for teaching assistant of the year </h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Sally Tedd</strong>, Highbury primary (West); <strong>Carol Archer</strong>, Bridgetown primary (West Midlands); <strong>Andrea Davies</strong>, Ysgol y Llan, Whitford (Wales); <strong>Sarah Felgate</strong>, Orchard Vale community school (South-west); <strong>Marilyn West</strong>, Stocklake Park school (South); <strong>Lorraine Eyre-Walker</strong>, Hillside school (South-east); <strong>Jennifer Doyle</strong>, Hart Memorial primary (Northern Ireland); <strong>Mandy Skillen</strong>, Woodlands primary (North-west); <strong>Dawn Cooper-Noble</strong>, Saxton CE primary (North); <strong>Sarah Lawler</strong>, Churchill community college (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Diane Stanley</strong>, Brunswick Park school (London); <strong>Paula Wright</strong>, Henderson Green primary (East); <strong>Raine Hart</strong>, Glenbrook primary and foundation school (East Midlands)</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham's</a> chairman, Daniel Levy, is determined that Juande Ramos should oversee an upturn in Tottenham Hotspur's fortunes and hopes that the Spaniard can spark a Premier League revival against Bolton Wanderers at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Tottenham travel to the Serie A high flyers Udinese on Thursday for the opening tie of their Uefa Cup group, but it is the Bolton fixture which is considered pivotal.</p> <p>Ramos has been subjected to increasing pressure as his team have stumbled from one horror result to the next. The 2-1 defeat at Stoke City on Sunday left them at the bottom of the table with only two points from their eight matches. But Levy is loth to sack Ramos, whom he prised from Sevilla almost a year ago amid acrimony, and although his patience will not hold for ever he is resolved to stick with him as the fixtures come thick and fast. The team will play every three or four days for the next four weeks because of their commitments in the Premier League, Uefa Cup and Carling Cup.</p> <p>Questions remain about Ramos's handling of a difficult situation and the fear is that, with confidence so fragile, it might snowball beyond his control. The feeling at boardroom level is that such a point has not yet been reached.</p> <p>After Sunday's game Jonathan Woodgate defended Ramos, saying: \"The buck stops with the players. We've played well at times but this season we haven't cut it. We will stick by the manager no matter what. He still inspires us. He is the manager and hopefully will continue to be. We're hurting inside but we have to stand up and get ourselves out of this mess that we've got ourselves into. We know we've got good players, even though we're not showing it.\"</p> <p>Questions are being asked about the thinking behind some of Spurs' summer signings. David Bentley cost \u00a315m from Blackburn but Ramos had wanted a left-sided midfielder and Bentley's best position is on the right, where Tottenham already had Aaron Lennon. Ramos tried Bentley on the left but it was quickly apparent he was not ready to provide the solution there.</p> <p>With Lennon finding some overdue form in difficult circumstances - this is now Tottenham's worst start to a league season in their 126-year history - Bentley has been chopped and changed. This was not how the move to White Hart Lane was advertised and he has not been happy.</p> <p>The goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, is the only first-team summer signing to have emerged with credit. Luka Modric, especially, has fallen flat. The Croatian playmaker must have wondered what he was doing as the wind howled and Stoke launched their physical assault, and his compatriot, the defender Vedran Corluka, having been carried off unconscious, must have come round and wished that his transfer from Manchester City was no more than a bad dream. The Russian striker Roman Pavlyuchenko has also flattered to deceive.</p> <p>The sporting director, Damien Comolli, who oversaw the transfers, is expected to pay with his job, although he did hear a voice of support yesterday. \"Damien is quality,\" said the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who employed him as a scout.</p> <p>\"You can't say the situation at Tottenham is down just to that [the employment of a sporting director]. It can work as long as people when they sign their contracts know what their responsibilities are. Football is a strange thing. When you lose your confidence you can become quickly average, it is as simple as that.\"</p> <p>Tottenham have been worse than that this season and Ramos faces a selection teaser in central defence for the games against Udinese and Bolton. Corluka is cup-tied and may not have recovered from concussion by Sunday and Michael Dawson will be suspended against Bolton.</p> <p>Ramos opted to keep the captain, Ledley King, who cannot play regularly because of injury, out of the firing line at Stoke to save him for Udinese - a perplexing decision: weren't Stoke more important? - and he may now have to play him instead against Bolton.</p> <p>There was, however, some good news for Ramos yesterday when Slaven Bilic, the Croatia coach who has been linked with several Premier League clubs, said he was not interested in taking over at Spurs. \"I have my job with Croatia and that's all I'm concentrating on,\" he said. \"I know the situation they are in but I'm sure it is going to get better. It's a massive club.\"</p>",
  "<p>The father of a seven-year-old girl killed when her quad bike hit a 4x4 car on an unlit rural road yesterday received a nine-month suspended jail sentence after admitting her manslaughter.</p> <p>Elizabeth Cooke and her older brother Jack were following their father's car on Boxing Day last year when she collided head on with a Range Rover. The children had been given the 100cc bikes for Christmas.</p> <p>Organic egg farmer Gary Cooke, 46, admitted killing Elizabeth during a hearing at Chelmsford crown court, in Essex. Stephen Harvey QC, prosecuting, said that it was the first time Elizabeth, known as Lizzie, had driven a quad bike on the road. </p> <p>The court heard that Cooke went to collect friends who lived less than a mile away from his farm near Blackmore, Essex. He allowed the children to ride their new quad bikes, with a top speed of 36mph, behind his Range Rover. </p> <p>Elizabeth was killed after an oncoming Range Rover drove past Cooke and hit Elizabeth on Fingrith Hall Lane, an unlit narrow road which is single track in places.</p> <p>Elizabeth was thrown on to the bonnet of the Range Rover driven by a 28-year-old woman and fell unconscious on the side of the road.</p> <p>Harvey said neither Range Rover was travelling quickly, but Elizabeth had not been able to control her quad bike.</p> <p>\"This tragic incident was a direct result of the defendant's gross negligence,\" said Harvey. </p> <p>It is illegal to ride a quad bike on the road under the age of 16.</p> <p>Annette Henry, defending, said Cooke held himself responsible for his daughter's death. \"Clearly this is a tragic accident which has absolutely devastated the Cooke family and one for which Mr Cooke holds himself responsible,\" she said. \"He clearly will never forgive himself for what has happened. He is already living a life sentence.\"</p> <p>Judge Christopher Ball QC said Cooke had been \"grossly negligent\" and \"stupid\".</p> <p>\"I don't suppose I am alone in remembering the shock of hearing the news on the radio when this happened,\" said the judge. \"I don't suppose I was alone in immediately thinking 'what sort of a fool would allow his child out in such circumstances?'.</p> <p>\"It was a moment of great folly and the consequences will remain with you for ever.\"</p> <p>The judge suspended the jail sentence for two years and banned Cooke from driving a quad bike on public roads for two years.</p> <p>Sergeant Dave Jones, of Essex police, said yesterday that Elizabeth's death had been an avoidable tragedy.</p> <p>\"I hope that anyone thinking about buying a quad bike, mini moto or motorised scooter this coming Christmas will think really hard about the potential consequences. These are not toys, they are machines that can be dangerous and need skill and experience to handle. </p> <p>\"I sincerely wish that lessons are learnt and something like this doesn't happen again.\"</p>",
  "<p>The international financial system is broken. An integrated set of reforms will be needed to achieve sustained economic growth and shared prosperity. The G8 leaders of Europe, Japan and the US have agreed on an emergency summit this autumn in New York to revamp the international system - a good idea, provided it initiates a wide-ranging set of changes rather than being a one-off meeting focused on market regulation.</p> <p>The G8 leaders are keen to start on regulation and that is understandable. Wall Street, the City of London and other financial centres ran wild with undercapitalised borrowing and lending stoked by over-the-top fees and bonuses. Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve fed the financial bubble with rock-bottom interest rates and regulatory forbearance, when it had the chance to restrain it. And the derivatives market was allowed to become so vast and unwieldy that there is no clarity as to who owes what to whom in tens of trillions of dollars of credit default swaps and other derivatives.</p> <p>Risk assessments have been made enterprise by enterprise without consideration of systemic risk. When institutions are \"too big to fail\", they must be closely supervised so that indeed they don't bring the entire system down when they do, from time to time, fail. And we have learned again that there is no global lender of last resort, only a hodgepodge of individual central banks and treasuries, whose individual actions may be sufficient or not to stem a panic.</p> <p>The G8 leaders must go well beyond the issues of financial regulation, however. Even before the current crisis, the global economic system was failing in crucial ways. Many poor countries remain cut off from global prosperity, often falling into poverty-induced violence and conflict. These will be still harder hit by the downturn. The global environmental crisis was also worsening, and climate shocks were wreaking havoc with world food supplies. Energy systems were in turmoil as the growing world economy pushed against supply constraints, yet there was no consensus on how to create an energy system compatible with the environmental and economic needs of the planet. These challenges are in desperate need of attention not only on their own merits, but also because global economic growth cannot be sustained without solutions to these crises. </p> <p>Financial assistance to the poorest countries - a lifeline for more than a billion people - is in tatters. Europe and the US have mobilised around $3 trillion in the past month in guarantees and bail-out funds for the banks but failed to mobilise even one ten-thousandth of that this year to help the world's poorest grow more food in the midst of a massive food-price increase and hunger crisis.</p> <p>The US has been blind to the millennium development goals (MDGs) on fighting poverty, hunger, and disease. When George Bush addressed the UN in September - supposedly the mid-point in achieving the goals - he mentioned \"terror\" 31 times while failing to mention the goals even once. All the big donors except Britain - including the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada - are failing to live up to long-standing aid commitments.</p> <p>The leaders should pause to reflect that there is another little-mentioned international summit scheduled for December in Doha, Qatar, to take up the challenge of financing development. It comes six years after a similar summit in Mexico, at which countries pledged \"concrete efforts\" to achieve 0.7% of GNP in development assistance - a level of aid none of them have yet fulfilled.</p> <p>A true Bretton Woods II summit would set a financial framework to achieve urgent global goals in macroeconomic stability, economic development, environmental sustainability and trade for development. All these are vital for long-term sustainable growth, but global goals in all four areas remain unachieved. Summiteers should come with chequebooks and international commitments in hand.</p> <p>Here, then, is an agenda for Bretton Woods II. First, we need to restructure global finance, based on an expanded system of capital adequacy standards, financial reporting, system-wide risk management, and new lender-of-last-resort capacities. Derivatives traders, hedge funds, and broker dealers would be brought under regulatory control. The IMF would be empowered to be a true global lender of last resort (as I urged a dozen years ago, warning of the threat of self-fulfilling panics). To make this possible, a small tax on financial transactions - a Tobin tax - would be implemented to expand the IMF's war chest in case of crisis and to fund other urgent international needs.</p> <p>Second, the new global financial structure should help to rescue the world from human-induced climate change. A straightforward tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels, levied by all countries, would do the job, and much better than the enormously cumbersome emission-trading system concocted and championed by the same financial engineers who brought us our current banking crisis. Most of the carbon-tax revenues would stay at home in each country, to help finance low-emission technologies. Some would be directed to finance three global public goods: research and development on sustainable energy; transfer of sustainable-energy technology to low-income countries; and climate-change adaptation.</p> <p>Third, the World Bank should be refocused with clear goals, and accountability for their success. Specifically, the bank should have one overarching assignment: helping the poorest countries achieve the millennium development goals to reduce poverty, hunger and disease. The bank is poorly organised for such leadership today. Like any bureaucracy, it avoids being held accountable for measurable results. With a tighter focus on the MDGs, the bank should also be supported with much larger financial resources from new revenue sources (such as the Tobin tax), so that the bank can better help the poorest countries expand vital infrastructure (power, roads, water, sanitation and broadband networks).</p> <p>Fourth, the global trade agenda should be integrated with the finance, and environment objectives. The Doha trade round has failed because the world could not see any urgent reasons for its success. A trade agreement worthy of the effort would do two main things. Importantly, it would help the poorest countries to be more productive so that they can be full participants in the global trading system. \"Aid for trade\" would help these countries to build the skills, roads, bridges and clean power grids to support increased trade. In addition, global trade would promote environmental sustainability, to help enforce compliance with reduced carbon emissions and protection of endangered biodiversity.</p> <p>All these reforms are vital for long-term sustainable growth and development. If the political leaders focus only on financial-sector stability, but neglect the long-term problems of energy supplies, climate change, food production, disease control and extreme poverty, then global growth might be restored in the short term, only to succumb quickly to another global bout of rising energy and food prices, and geopolitical instability.</p> <p>The shortcomings of the existing Bretton Woods institutions, global environmental policies and international trading arrangements have been widely recognised for at least a generation. The current global crisis, and arrival of a new US president in the midst of this unprecedented economic meltdown, may finally mark the moment when the world takes seriously the urgent global economic and environmental agenda that confronts us in this new millennium. A summit in December will be a small step but could be the first meaningful action to steer the world to safety from the dire threats we face.</p> <p>\u2022 Jeffrey Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and author of Common Wealth <a href=\"http://www.earth.columbia.edu\">earth.columbia.edu</a></p>",
  "<p>The funding mismatch between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and his opponent for the US presidency, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, was starkly highlighted yesterday when the Republican candidate disclosed he had less than $47m (\u00a327m) available for the final stretch of the campaign to the November 4 election, compared with his rival's hundreds of millions.</p> <p>McCain, filing his accounts to the government-run electoral spending watchdog, revealed that in September he used $37m of the $84m in public funds he had available for his campaign.</p> <p>McCain accepted public financing of $84m, which puts a ceiling on any further spending under electoral law. Obama opted against public financing, leaving him free to raise and spend as much as he wants in private donations.</p> <p>The news came a day after Obama disclosed that he had raised a staggering $150m in September. </p> <p>Republican strategists admitted that the mismatch will mean that McCain's options are much narrower than Obama's and he will have to target the money more carefully on key states.</p> <p>Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, in a conference call with reporters, said: \"I think we can still win on that basis.\" But he admitted that Obama would go down as \"the greatest fundraiser in political history\".</p> <p>Davis expressed hope that the Republican party, which has separate funds amounting to $80m, would pitch in with ads supporting McCain's campaign. But some state party organisations, notably in Florida and Virginia, are reluctant to commit funds and are holding back for future contests.</p> <p>Massie Ritsch, who works for the independent Centre for Responsive Politics, a funding watchdog, acknowledged \"it is not a level playing field\". But he said the question was whether McCain could have matched Obama.</p> <p>\"I do not think he could have raised as much as Obama from private sources, or even near it. McCain must be hoping his party will close that gap,\" said Ritsch.</p> <p>Obama has raised more than $600m since the start of his presidential bid in February last year.</p> <p>Obama, who is already outspending McCain on advertising by four to one - and in some states by eight to one - is now well placed for a blitz on an unprecedented scale in the run-up to the election.</p> <p>In an NBC interview broadcast yesterday, Obama warned that, despite his spending advantage and poll leads both nationally and in battlefield states, the election would be close.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt. We think the race will tighten, because that's just what happens,\" he said. \"Even when there are substantial leads - and in each of these battleground states you've got a lot of close races - one of the messages that I've had to my team is that we don't let up.\"</p> <p>To underline the point, a CNN poll yesterday put Obama on 51% nationwide, to McCain's 46%, a marginal improvement for the Republican. The same pollsters earlier this month had Obama on 53% and McCain on 45%. But a Suffolk University poll in Ohio, one of the three big pivotal states, showed Obama extending his lead to 51%, compared to McCain's 42%.</p> <p>The polls were taken before George Bush's former secretary of state, Colin Powell, announced on Sunday that he was endorsing Obama. While that was widely interpreted as a plus for Obama's campaign, the influential rightwing radio celebrity, Rush Limbaugh, who attracts an audience of 15 million, claimed Powell made his decision based on racial solidarity. \"This was all about Powell and race, nothing about the nation and its welfare,\" Limbaugh said.</p> <p>With the election two weeks from today, the candidates are now close to the sprint stage, when the campaign day becomes longer and longer, with multi-state visits.</p> <p>Obama yesterday predicted that there would be more negative campaigning by McCain in the final fortnight. Referring to the weekend denunciation by McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, of \"robocalls\" - automatic phone calls linking Obama to Bill Ayers, a founding member of the US radical group the Weathermen - and of incendiary remarks at Republican rallies, Obama said: \"It's getting so bad that even Senator McCain's running mate denounced his tactics last night. As you know, you really have to work hard to violate Governor Palin's standards on negative campaigning.</p> <p>\"But we're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be diverted. Not this time. Not this year. Our challenges are too great for a politics that's so small.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"You can either be a Christian school or a school for Christians. You can't be both.\" It's the sort of simple paradox that the Rev Steve Chalke, head of the Christian charity and academy sponsor Oasis Trust, rather specialises in, and his tanned and handsome face breaks into a satisfied smile. It's the same smile I get when I ask him about his evangelical Christianity and he says: \"You've told me you don't believe in God twice this morning. You're an evangelical atheist.\" I sense that I am not the first atheist he has used it on.</p> <p>But then, Chalke's whole involvement in academies is a paradox. For a start, the idea of creating two tiers of schools - one of the most potent criticisms of academies - runs directly counter to everything he stands for, because he was born near Croydon, south London, 52 years ago, and went to a secondary modern school there. \"On our first day we were told by the headmaster that we would never do O-levels because we were not those sort of children, and that we would be blue collar workers,\" he says. Academies have the right to select up to 10% of their intake, but you will never find an Oasis academy doing so.</p> <p><strong>Selection by religion</strong></p> <p>If his parents had been churchgoers, he could have escaped the consequences of his 11-plus failure by getting into a local Church of England school. \"So the difference between being told I mattered and being told I didn't matter came down to selection by religion.\" He thought he was a failure until the age of 14, when he started to go to a Christian youth club, mainly because a girl he fancied went there. \"They told me I mattered, my life had potential, I could achieve,\" he says. </p> <p>So, not for him the contempt for local authorities that you find in some academy sponsors, nor any disdain for the teachers' trade unions. Oasis pays the nationally agreed rate, neither more nor less. He does not like the sort of academy that gets huge amounts of public money, making neighbouring schools look impoverished. Chalke thinks that a school which acts on its own will harm other schools.</p> <p>He married at 24 and has four grown-up children - the youngest is 20. When we met, Chalke was, in a sense, coming home. It was the opening of the Oasis Academy Coulsdon near Croydon, which until this term was known as Coulsdon high school. He is determined it will remain the sort of comprehensive school that the area ought to have possessed when he needed one. </p> <p>Oasis brought in a new principal, John Murphy. At only 41, this is his sixth headship. \"So you won't be staying long,\" I said, but he told me he was there for the duration because he loves Oasis. And of course, it is Oasis he is working for. Once a school is turned into an academy, other members of the governing body - councillors, parents, teachers - start to become irrelevant: the head works for the sponsor, who has an inbuilt majority on the governing body. \"This is John Murphy's line manager,\" said Chalke as he introduced me to Howard Green, the Oasis director of education.</p> <p>Murphy is a high flyer, having achieved his first headship at the age of 29. He has already run three primary schools, a residential special school and a secondary school, and his own trading company. He is tall and imposing, wears smart suits, and as my taxi drew up, he opened its door with a flourish and shook my hand, his mid-length businessman's overcoat giving him the appearance of a managing director welcoming an important client.</p> <p>Murphy is a practising Catholic, but Chalke insists that Christianity is no more a requirement for Oasis heads than for pupils, and he has a non-believing head in Salford. However, Chalke's own life is centred around Christianity, and the evangelical fervour he brings to his vision for schools can turn in an instant to fervent theological debate. </p> <p><strong>Supports Darwin</strong></p> <p>He is a Baptist minister, and has split the evangelicals into warring factions with a book called The Lost Message of Jesus, in which he rejected the idea of what theologians call penal substitutionary atonement to explain the crucifixion of Christ. Chalke writes that this theory is in effect one of \"a vengeful father, punishing his Son for an offence he has not even committed ... The fact is that the cross isn't a form of cosmic child abuse.\" His heresy goes further: he supports Darwin's theory of evolution. \"Six day creationism is a misunderstanding of the biblical text. Genesis 1 is a metaphorical poem,\" he says, before bounding into a lengthy piece of biblical analysis.</p> <p>He is saying all this in a crowded room on an important day, and his enthusiasm affects everyone. At last we all decamp to the hall and join the pupils. Chalke is the main act, a passionate talker selling Oasis to the pupils it has just acquired. \"This is what you're now part of,\" he says, describing the charity's work in India and how they help rescue young people from trafficking. He's full of simple homilies: \"In this whole universe there is one part you have control of, and it's called you\" and \"are you a dreamer or a visionary?\" He's transparently sincere and evangelically charismatic.</p> <p>Not that I was entirely convinced. There were too many pinstripe suits nodding approval of every wise saw from Chalke, a shred too much happy clappiness, and if an Oasis academy is to be inclusive I was not sure why the local vicar was called upon to \"lead us in prayer\". But if my local school had to be taken out of the control of the community and handed over to some faraway sponsor, I'd rather it was the dynamic, egalitarian Chalke, who knows we are giving him a privilege by letting him run our children's education, rather than the grey Anglicans at the Church of England and the United Learning Trust, who seem to think we ought to be grateful to them.</p>",
  "<p>There has long been an assumption among those \"in the know\" that the cap on tuition fees for full-time undergraduate students - \u00a33,145 - would be lifted, if not abolished, as a result of next year's review. A series of heavyweight figures, not all of them connected with Oxbridge, are pressing the case for an increase, as are some distinguished economists. A recent sample of vice-chancellors thought that a figure of \u00a36,500 would be about right, with no change in the teaching grant to institutions. How likely is this?</p> <p>Even before the credit crunch, the assumption that the cap would be raised or abolished was a very large one. There are some strong arguments in favour. The present fee remains well below the cost of tuition. UK spending on teaching is still below the average among the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and well below what some universities believe is necessary to compete for scholars and students internationally. There is a big backlog of investment, which can only be financed by borrowing against future cash flows. Nor is there much evidence so far that the increased fee has reduced demand, even among students from poorer backgrounds.</p> <p>One important reason for this may be the student support regime that was put in place when variable fees were introduced. With \"up front\" fees abolished, students can borrow to meet both tuition and living costs at a rate of interest that is zero in real terms (in other words, which only keeps pace with inflation), with repayment only beginning when they are earning \u00a315,000 a year. Students from households with incomes of up to \u00a360,000 can benefit from maintenance grants, and there is also a bewildering array of institutional bursaries.</p> <p>It is the sheer cost of these arrangements to the taxpayer that represents the biggest obstacle to raising the cap. Earlier this year, the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) reported that the cost of the loans to the exchequer would exceed \u00a31.4bn; with maintenance grants, the cost would reach \u00a32.5bn. This is nearly double the total public spending on student support and fees in the year in which the variable fees legislation was enacted. Since the great majority of beneficiaries are from middle-class backgrounds, it is hardly surprising that one commentator, Peter Wilby, described the whole package thus: \"This is the sound of the suburbs saying thanks for the cash.\" There is pressure for this support to be more fairly distributed. The government has already conceded a review of the support available to part-time students. Many of these are adults, but why stop with adults in higher education? What about offering adult level 3 income-contingent loans? The equity issue also affects the distribution of bursaries, with another recent Hepi report showing the strength of the case for a national bursary scheme. </p> <p>The difficulty is that, if public expenditure is not to be increased, these demands can only be met by taking money from someone else. With the public purse already more than \u00a340bn overdrawn at the start of the present crisis in the financial markets, there can be very little likelihood of public expenditure on higher education increasing. But with the probable impact on domestic finances, it is also hard to see ministers of any party asking families to pay more, especially as the economic benefits of higher education appear to be diminishing. A third of those who started university since fees were first introduced in 1998 are still to make repayments because they are not earning enough, and average debt levels rising beyond \u00a320,000. </p> <p>While some employers' leaders are on record as wanting more \"relevant\" degrees, their record in funding training does not suggest that they will be prepared to put their money where their mouth is. Nor will the credit crunch assist the push for universities to build up their endowments; this is probably just as well, because in the short run at least this will simply increase the economic disparities between institutions.</p> <p>So any increase in the fees beyond the gross domestic product deflator (the government's measure of general inflation) now looks most unlikely. But there may be a silver lining.</p> <p>The crisis in the financial markets, and the impact on the wider economy, must have shown even New Labour politicians the weaknesses of the market model, at least in its present, largely unregulated form. Yet successive governments have worked to extend this model to what used to be called the \"public\" sector. Now that the market model, at least as presently configured, has been seen not to work even in sectors where there is a clear \"bottom line\", is it too much to suggest that any further attempts to apply it in education will be abandoned? Or would that be too much to hope?</p> <p>\u2022 Roger Brown is professor of higher education policy and co-director of the Centre for Research and Development in Higher Education at Liverpool Hope University</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the joys of modern media that great events can be savoured in so many ways. Take the moment last weekend when the Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin came face to face with her impersonator and nemesis Tina Fey on the set of Saturday Night Live - a sublime moment that is sure to go down in both television and political history. You could have watched it live on TV if you happened to be in the States. You could have Tivoed it or downloaded it from the NBC website to enjoy when the fancy took you. Or - and this is how I recommend you do it, if you haven't already - you can pause the footage just as Palin is entering the stage and then forward it frame by frame until the precise second when the two women cross paths.</p> <p>Stop the film, and prepare to be astonished. Yes, we all knew that Palin and Fey looked alike. But as alike as this? Height: identical. Shade of hair: identical. Size and shape of ears: identical. You can quibble if you must - Palin's face is a little fleshier, and her jaw more square and chiselled, as behoves a caribou hunter from the wildnerness, but as the freezed frame proves beyond all reasonable doubt, Sarah Fey and Tina Palin are one.</p> <p>It has been a long time coming, this fusion of politics and make-believe in the American psyche. Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two obvious examples of those who have taken the silver screen and dragged it into the political arena. But the Saturday Night Live series of sketches has taken the transposition one stage further, into wholly new and surreal territory. With this, the boundary between political reality and comic fantasy has become so blurred it is almost impossible to remember where the one ends and the other begins. </p> <p>The fantasy: in the first Saturday Night Live sketch, in which Fey played Palin, her partner Amy Poehler (in the role of Hillary Clinton) turned to her and said: \"You're wearing Tina Fey glasses!\"</p> <p>The reality: Palin has told Fox News that a few years ago - long before she was campaigning to become but a heartbeat away from the US presidency - she dressed up as Fey on Halloween. Yes, you read that right: Palin impersonated Fey.</p> <p>The fantasy: Fey-as-Palin, a huge grin on her face, turns to the Saturday Night Live camera and delivers her killer line: \"I can see Russia from my house!\"</p> <p>The reality: Palin-as-Palin really did invoke the fact that Alaska, the state of which she is governor, is across the water from Russia as evidence of her foreign policy credentials, though she never delivered the line about seeing it from her house. Yet, if you Google the phrase, \"I can see Russia from my house,\" you will come up with plenty of bloggers who have ascribed the phrase directly to Palin, unaware or perhaps unbothered that it was pure fiction.</p> <p>So what has been the impact of what Lorne Michaels, Saturday Night Live's legendary producer, called \"a heightened reality\"? One clear winner has been the show itself, the 33-year-old institution that is perennially in need of resuscitation. More than 10 million people watched the first appearance of Feylin. The last time the show had that big an audience was in 2001, when the show was broadcast just three weeks after 9/11 as a classic example of humour triumphing over terrorism. By this Saturday, the number had risen to about 17 million viewers, with millions more sure to follow on the internet. </p> <p>The other obvious beneficiary has been Tina Fey, or, since we are in the business of trying to tease fact apart from fiction, let's give her her full name: Elizabeth Stamatina Fey. She was certainly presented with an impersonator's dream when John McCain nominated Palin as his running mate. But the physical likeness is just the start of it. Last week she told the US talkshow host David Letterman how she pulled off the Palin accent. \"[Palin] has a really crazy voice,\" Fey said. \"It's a little bit Fargo, a little bit Reese Witherspoon in Election. I also try and base it on my friend Paula's grandma - a sweet little ol' lady from Joliet, Illinois.\"</p> <p>Fey asked the Saturday Night Live writer assigned to the Palin sketches to script in lots of words with Rs in them. \"She loves those Rs,\" Fey said. \"William Ayerrrrrrrrrs [the former Weatherman bomber invoked by Palin as a \"pall\" of Obama] and terrrrrorrrrists - I think she thinks there's oil in those Rs, she's digging deep.\"</p> <p>Part of the power of the sketches has been that they stick so closely to Palin's real words. Take Palin's now infamous response to a TV interviewer's question about the Bush doctrine on the right to pre-emptive strikes. The Alaskan governor had clearly never heard of the concept, and gave the evasive reply: \"In what respect?\" It would have been easy to satirise that comment out of existence, in the comedic equivalent of a frenzied knife attack. Instead, Fey quietly and fatally delivers a single blow, twisting Palin's response ever so slightly into: \"I don't know what that is.\"</p> <p>Fey is not just one of America's upcoming comic actors but also an experienced writer of comedy. Born in 1970 in a comfortable middle-class suburb of Pennsylvania to a strongly Republican family, she first felt the benefits of making people laugh at school and pursued that by studying drama at college. She cut her teeth in the comedy world at Second City, a well-respected improvisational theatre in Chicago, where she met her composer husband Jeff Richmond. Saturday Night Live scouts spotted her there and she joined the show in 1997.</p> <p>Within two years she had been promoted by Michaels to head writer on the show - the first woman to occupy the role. So, like Palin, she was breaking glass ceilings; like Palin, battling within highly male and testosterone-fuelled environments. Tom Shales, the TV critic of the Washington Post and co-author of a history of Saturday Night Live, Live From New York, says that though the show had had several powerful women actors, including Gilda Radner, women had struggled to find a footing within the writers' room. \"The show had a very bad reputation for being a male and almost misogynistic club with men in leading positions and women in the wings. Tina was in the vanguard of changing that - you could call her the Joan of Arc of the moment.\"</p> <p>Along with other tough women actors and writers, including Poehler, Molly Shannon, Ana Gasteyer and Rachel Dratch, she succeeded in shaking the programme up, first as senior writer and then, from 2000, as co-anchor of the news segment of the show, Weekend Update, a stint that earned her the ultimate accolade of being compared by one critic to Saturday Night Live's first head writer and figurehead, John Belushi. In the inevitable trajectory of these things, Fey has gone on to greater things - quitting Saturday Night Live in 2006 to pursue her acting career. Her TV series 30 Rock, a spoof on the behind-the-scenes life of a neurotic television writer that draws, evidently, on her own experiences, has become a favourite of the media-savvy crowd. It won three Emmys this year, including an award for Fey for best actress in a comedy show. But despite its success, 30 Rock has remained something of an acquired taste, not quite shifting her into the top bracket of performers who can draw box-office profits across America. Ironically it has taken Sarah Palin to project her into the stratosphere, making her a household name.</p> <p>Tina Fey, winner. Saturday Night Live, winner. But the big question, of course, is how does Palin come out of all this? Will political analysts look back on the Feylin phenomenon and say it was the thing that saved the governor of Alaska from herself, or that drove the final nail into her coffin?</p> <p>Pollsters give a few clues. First, we know that the Fey-as-Palin sketches have had huge penetration among voters. The non-partisan Pew Research Centre found that awareness of the sketches was running at about 42% - one point greater than Palin's \"real\" TV interviews. Another firm of analysts, HCD Research, studied the reaction among voters to the sketches and found that Palin's favourability rating fell by four points among independents and seven points among Democrats.</p> <p>That instant adverse reaction to the ridicule heaped on Palin by her doppelganger may be amplified by what analysts have defined as the \"priming\" effect of political humour. Lauren Feldman, a communications professor at the American University, described the process by which satire can work on viewers' subconscious. \"The more you see Tina Fey sending up Sarah Palin's style of speech, her folksy mannerisms and her lack of knowledge, the more those characteristics rise to the top of your mind when you come to listen to the real Sarah Palin, and that influences your assessment of her.\"</p> <p>A similar pattern can be seen with past political jokes, with Gerald Ford often held up as the textbook victim. Some go as far as to suggest that the parody of Ford by Saturday Night Live's Chevy Chase as a bumbler-in-chief actually cost him the 1976 election.</p> <p>On the other hand, HCD Research also found a pronounced jolt in the other direction among Republican voters. After watching the Fey sketches, they emerged angry and fired up, determined to work even harder on behalf of their party to defeat what they see as the east-coast liberals who control the media and seek to brainwash the electorate. </p> <p>There is another way that the sketches by Fey, 38, could actually benefit Palin, 44. It has been suggested by several liberal bloggers that by focusing on the cutesy, bumbling side of Palin's nature, Fey could be distracting attention away from some of her uglier behaviour. As Time magazine pointed out recently, while Fey's Palin was asking to phone a friend because she couldn't answer a simple question from a TV interviewer, in reality, Palin's Palin was out on the campaign stump, telling the whipped-up crowd that Obama was \"not a man who sees America like you and I see America\".</p> <p>Whichever of these dynamics - the pro- or anti-Palin - proves to be more prominent, we do know one thing: Tina Fey is praying for her lookalike to lose. \"She's enjoyed the run, and it's greatly increased her visibility,\" says Shales. \"But she knows it has to end and she doesn't want to get stuck in the part and typecast. She'll be happy when it goes away.\"</p> <p>Michaels has confirmed that even in the now somewhat unlikely case that the Republicans win and Palin enters the White House as vice president, Saturday Night Live will be looking for a new impersonator of her. As for Fey, she has said: \"I want to be done playing this lady by 5 November. So if anybody can help me be done playing this lady, that would be good for me.\"</p> <p>There's no need to worry about what happens to Fey thereafter. Life for her after Palin is already looking bountiful. Next year she is due to appear in This Side of Truth, directed by Ricky Gervais, and she is in discussions over further Hollywood films after last year's debut Baby Mama, which received mixed reviews. 30 Rock has started its third series, and publishers Little, Brown has just commissioned a book from her reputed to be worth $5m.</p> <p>And what about Palin? We'll know better what fate holds for her in 15 days' time. But even if she doesn't make it to the White House, don't feel too sorry for her. There's bound to be big money out there for her to repeat her Halloween impersonation of Tina Fey.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008.

  "<p>For the handful of Moscow pensioners gathered beside Karl Marx's statue on Sunday there was, at last, something to be cheerful about: Russia's communists are these days a marginal and increasingly doddering force, but what the Soviet Union was unable to achieve in 70 years - the overthrow of global capitalism - now appears to be happening, including in Russia.</p> <p>The most prominent victim is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, until recently Russia's richest man. In May his fortune, according to Forbes magazine, was $28.6bn (\u00a317bn). His empire encompassed aluminium, construction, car parts, and the LDV van factory in Birmingham. </p> <p>His fortune outdid even that of his friend Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, by $4.3bn.</p> <p>In April, Deripaska was bullish. His metals firm, Rusal, could soon float in either Hong Kong or London, he said.</p> <p>Six months later, Deripaska has hit the new economic reality with a crunch. Like many Russian oligarchs, he aggressively expanded his business by borrowing billions against the value of his company's assets. Since May, however, these have shrunk. Russia's stock market has tanked - losing a whopping 71% of its value. </p> <p>Spooked foreign investors have fled, because of the global credit crisis but also because of the war in Georgia and the Kremlin's interventions in the market.</p> <p>Earlier this month Deripaska was forced to sell his 9.99% stake in the German construction giant Hochtief and a $1.4bn stake in the Canadian auto parts maker Magna. But it may not satisfy his creditors. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Financial Times reported that Deripaska was trying to borrow $2bn, which he needs by the end of this month to repay part of a $4.5bn loan from western banks that he used to buy a 25% stake in the world's biggest nickel miner. </p> <p>It is, perhaps, too early to talk about the demise of Russia's oligarchs or the return of communism. But experts agree that Russia's super-rich have taken an unprecedented hit. </p> <p>In May, Russia boasted 87 billionaires - a number second only to the US. At least half were likely to lose their billionaire status in 2009, according to the editor of Forbes Russia, Maxim Kalushinky. </p> <p>\"It's still unclear what's going to happen. But we are in a mess,\" he said. \"People have borrowed millions of dollars using their shares as collateral. It's just the same as borrowing money to buy an apartment. Now they have to sell everything to repay the credit.\"</p> <p>However, some of Russia's fun-loving elite are insisting that all is well. Stands at next month's Moscow millionaires' fair, where you can pick up a jet or space-age piano, are all booked out. </p> <p>Last week, however, the financial news agency Bloomberg estimated Russia's top 25 individuals had collectively lost $230bn over the last five months - with Deripaska dropping $16bn. </p> <p>The caviar counters of Moscow's upmarket supermarkets are deserted and Moscow's notoriously snooty nightclubs have relaxed their vigorous system of \"face control\".</p> <p>So far the Kremlin has refused to acknowledge that the global economic crisis has affected Russia. Russian TV says it's an American problem and Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, declared the US's leading role in economic affairs was over. The Russian government has offered $50bn in loans to help the oligarchs, but there isn't enough money to go round, analysts suggest. </p> <p>\"It's definitely very difficult times for these people. But they are not going to go bankrupt,\" Vladimir Osakovsky, chief economist at Moscow's Unicredit Aton brokerage said.</p> <p>Yesterday, Deripaska's investment company Basic Element conceded times were tough. </p> <p>\"There are no companies in the world today that are immune from the consequences of this crisis,\" it said, adding that its \"business strategy remains intact\" and that it would \"stay competitive in the current conditions\".</p> <p>But what about rumours that the oligarch had sacked all his private staff, to save roubles? \"Basic Element does not comment on Mr Deripaska's private matters,\" the company said.</p>",
  "<p>The European arrest warrant is an effective EU instrument for bringing suspected and convicted criminals to justice. Unfortunately, however, it is falling into disrepute, and EU member states are to blame.</p> <p>Your article highlighting trivial requests clogging up the system is one illustration of strain (Door thief, piglet rustler, pudding snatcher: UK courts despair at extradition requests, October 20). Other problems are shown by current cases: the German demand to extradite Dr Fredrick T\u00f6ben for Holocaust denial and an Italian demand to extradite Tunisian men where there is a real risk of onward deportation to torture.</p> <p>The main reason for this is a failure by EU governments to invest in ensuring a level playing field. They have ducked the challenge of tackling substantive disparities in legal systems, patchy respect for fair trial and human rights, and tussles over where cases should be pursued.</p> <p>If they are not prepared to do this hard work, there should alternatively be an honest recognition of the need to invoke human rights, civil liberties, public policy and \"stop wasting our time\" bars to extradition to another EU country.</p> <p>At present we have neither the investment nor the honest recognition, and thus a mess. I would prefer the first option, in order to preserve the red-tape-reducing purpose of the European arrest warrant and prevent criminals and terrorists escaping the law. But I want real, not pretend, justice, so the second option seems the only feasible one while governments' inaction persists.</p> <p>Judges should be permitted to do their job of truly upholding the rule of law, not be expected to blindly ignore injustice.<br><strong>Sarah Ludford MEP</strong><br>Lib Dem, London </p> <p>Those of us who were concerned at the flaws in the European legislation behind the European arrest warrant cannot be surprised at the current farce.Earlier this year we learned that it was costing an average of over \u00a34,000 to bring children up before the juvenile courts on such trivial charges as stealing a nail or half a loaf. No figures per case were quoted in your article, but one would be surprised if the pudding snatcher was costing the UK taxpayer less than \u00a310,000, including the special charter of the military aircraft to fly him home.</p> <p>It would besensible for the European council to agree an amendment of the legislation to provide for the issuing country to pay a standard court fee, say \u20ac10,000, before the extradition process can commence. Unfortunately, in the legislative limbo the EU occupies without the Lisbon treaty such amendments are virtually impossible. Besides, Poland, which contracted out of the EU prisoner transfer system on the grounds that it would lose out financially from it, is bound to exercise its veto.<br><strong>Stephen Jakobi</strong><br>Richmond, Surrey</p>",

  "<p>There was air of optimism on the banking front yesterday. The Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - edged downwards. Royal Bank of Scotland's shares surged by almost a quarter to 84.5p, well above the 65p level at which the government would inject capital; as long as that situation holds, RBS could yet escape part-nationalisation.</p> <p>But what's that dark cloud? It's HBOS. At 79p, the shares have again come adrift from the Lloyds TSB takeover price - at a discount of 25%, the market seems to be suggesting that there is a one-in-four chance that the deal could fail to happen. Is that realistic?</p> <p>Probably not - for two reasons. First, as has been widely noted, many large institutional shareholders own shares in both banks and have no interest in trashing HBOS's share price. The second reason is less appreciated: Lloyds has not spelled out the possible painful consequences of failing to complete the takeover.</p> <p>Read last week's documentation again. Lloyds said its \u00a35.5bn capital-raising \"is conditional on the passing of various resolutions including those relating to the acquisition of HBOS\". Or read new City minister Paul Myners' article in this paper yesterday: the government, he said, has agreed to invest in Lloyds and HBOS \"upon their successful merger\".</p> <p>The implication seems clear: if the deal doesn't happen, lots of other assumptions could unravel. Would a standalone Lloyds be required to raise the relatively modest sum of \u00a35.5bn, or would the figure increase? Probably the latter. After all, Lloyds would not enjoy the benefit of ripping out \u00a31bn-plus of costs from the two banks' combined operations. So, arguably, its capital cushion would need to be greater.</p> <p>And would the government still be prepared to invest in Lloyds on last week's terms? Who knows? Barclays, when it opted to raise capital privately, was told not to assume the same terms would still be available if it found itself passing the hat back to the taxpayer.</p> <p>There is no use asking Lloyds for answers to these questions. It will only trot out a standard line about proceeding with the deal. Chief executive Eric Daniels, it seems, would prefer his investors to accept his view that buying HBOS will yield long-term benefits. That is the carrot he is dangling. But it seems there is also a hefty stick in the background that nobody is acknowledging. Lloyds, when it gets round to issuing the takeover documentation, should give its shareholders the full picture.</p> <h2>And your aim is, Pru?</h2> <p>It is just as well that Prudential will update the market on trading today. The insurer's share price - down 30% last week, up 22% yesterday - is all over the place. Investors need comfort. In particular, they need chief executive Mark Tucker to tell them that he hasn't gone mad and has no intention of issuing shares at the current price.</p> <p>The task has been achieved only in part. Prudential has successfully quashed speculation that it could be forced into a rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet. So we must assume that today's numbers for new business sales and surplus capital will be robust.</p> <p>That leaves uncertainty over Tucker's appetite for pursuing an acquisition of all or part of AIG's operations in Asia. Here the plot is harder to unpick. One can understand why Tucker may see a deal as attractive. The Pru and AIG are the two western insurers to have made the greatest inroads into Asia - they have been there for well over 10 years and both operate in a dozen countries - so the fit would be good. Tucker would be annoyed if AIG's operations dropped into the lap of a big well capitalised competitor such as Axa of France. </p> <p>The problem is that it could require \u00a38bn to buy AIG's Asian operations outright. Pru itself is worth only \u00a38.2bn, so such a momentous deal ought to be out of reach. Getting into an auction with Axa sounds a dangerous game.</p> <p>Maybe parts of AIG could be stripped away - the right \u00a31bn acquisition would be an easier sell. But the terms would have to be right. Issuing shares on sweetheart terms to a sovereign wealth fund sounds a surefire way to enrage current investors. Today would be a good moment to kill such talk.</p> <h2>Watch Wimpey</h2> <p>We knew Taylor Wimpey was in bad shape, but look at this: at a share price of 10.5p, the housebuilder is now worth just \u00a3110m. Too big to fail? asked broker Collins Stewart yesterday. Its answer is that it still expects Taylor Wimpey, like Barratt, to secure a fresh banking agreement for its \u00a31.5bn of debt. The banks, thinks analyst Imran Akram, have enough problems without calling in the assets of the largest UK housebuilder. We shall see. Taylor Wimpey is the first big test of how tough the banks intend to be in the new lending climate.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The government is at risk of creating a society where \"freedom's back is broken\", the director of public prosecutions has said while attacking counter-terrorism policy in a speech yesterday.</p> <p>Citing the \"relentless pressure of a security state\", Sir Ken Macdonald QC added to criticism of new laws in the wake of the government's defeat over proposals to detain terrorism suspects for 42 days without trial.</p> <p>Macdonald, who steps down this month after five years as head of the Crown Prosecution Service, described some aspects of the government's response to the terrorism threat as \"medieval delusions\".

  "<p>All gorgeous girls should have a great pair of jeans. All luscious ladies should have a pair of classic riding boots. Thus spake Gok Wan, the latest and most successful TV fashion expert, in his hyperbolic book, How To Dress. Well, I have a fashion rule of my own: all women should spend an afternoon with Gok Wan. </p> <p>How does a man who has a penchant for banging on about \"bangers\" (breasts in Gok Speak) fill the women of Great Britain, including, to my enormous surprise, this one, with such warm and fuzzy feelings? One newspaper called him \"the saviour of modern womanhood\". Lorraine Kelly simply refers to him as \"the messiah\".</p> <p>Well, after our time together I can reveal the secret recipe - one part self-exaggeration to three parts palpable sincerity, a dash of a sympathetic personal story and a final helping of empathy - which attracts public fondness the likes of which I've never seen before. Any celebrity can be recognised, only a few seem like friends. \"Hi Gok!\" \"Hey, man!\" \"Hi, how you doing?\" cry out the dozen or so passersby as we stand outside the restaurant taking a fag break. \"Hi!\" he waves cheerily back, before quietly, and a little wearily, adding, \"I pretend I know everyone now.\"</p> <p>To those who have somehow avoided Wan - and, given that the 35-year-old has made three programmes in three years, as well as writing various magazine columns and launching a range of lingerie, that would take some effort - it is fair to call him, to use another of his favourite words, a \"phenomenon\". When it was announced that Trinny &amp; Susannah was losing viewers with their Undress the Nation programme, newspapers blamed \"the Gok factor\", a theory he doesn't deny, saying simply that he \"felt quite sorry for them. I mean, they were just doing a job and at the height of their fame people wanted that TV bitch thing. Then the climate changed.\" He makes a point of adding, not entirely accurately, that, \"we did two totally different jobs - they're TV presenters, I'm a working stylist. It's like comparing me to Terry Wogan.\"</p> <p>It is more correct to say that both How To Look Good Naked (getting insecure people to love their bodies so much they will take their clothes off) and Gok's Fashion Fix (in which he takes the Blue Peter approach to styling, showing how to make an outfit look \"almost as good as designer\" with some randomly placed corsages and a bit of sticky-backed plastic) stood out from all the rest of the cookie-cutter makeover programmes - Trinny &amp; Susannah, 10 Years Younger - if only through Wan's use of the English language. \"Exuberant\" doesn't even begin to describe it. \"Gok,\" Wikipedia intones, \"is noted for his enthusiastic use of the words 'literally' and 'bangers'.\" If there wasn't such palpable empathy in the way he gazes upon the (often sobbing and, later, ecstatic) participants, one could easily dismiss Wan for falling victim to a common peril for fashion TV presenters: neutering himself through campness. Though, as he easily admits, the campness is at least partly deliberate. One of the reasons Wan has taken over from T &amp; S is that women generally can take personal criticism better from a gay man than from two posh women. \"I think that's probably true. There's no competition and no fear of me getting too close to them sexually because that's not going to happen. Also I think the language gay men use can put women at ease quicker - the overuse of 'darling', 'sweetheart', all the new words for breasts - it helps break down barriers quicker.\" Moreover, one need only look at his co-presenter, Myleene Klass, on the upcoming Miss Naked Beauty, to see how hard it is to tread the line between \"sympathetic and motivating\" and \"cloying and annoying\", and how cannily Wan manages it.</p> <p>But the main difference between him and T &amp; S is that he is much nicer. Whereas T &amp; S talk about \"lumps\" and \"bulges\", Wan uses cuddly terms like \"yummy tummy\" and \"gorgeous curves\", even if, ultimately, his aim is to disguise them. He has recently brought out a pair of control-top knickers, so isn't he doing the same thing as his predecessors - making women feel that their natural shape is wrong? \"Well, there's a huge social argument about should we just be complete puritans and let it all hang out, or should we conform to the silhouette that the fashion industry has created for us? Well, if you want to wear clothes you have to conform to that shape because that's how the clothes are designed. So all I do is get the bodies that are slightly out of proportion and get the clothes that are right for that shape, and, um, whether that's a good or bad thing is up for debate. But ultimately, it's about getting women to feel good in their own skin,\" he concludes, bouncing in his seat.</p> <p>Wan was actually a stylist before becoming a presenter, so it is a touch ironic that most of his programmes are about getting people to take their clothes off. As is the way with most makeover programmes now, the stylist isn't expected to style but act as a psychologist. \"I know! But I like to believe these shows prove that clothes are massively about psychology. Well, that's how I justify it to myself,\" he says.</p> <p>In fact, he has simply picked up what Trinny &amp; Susannah eventually learned: TV viewers are far more interested in nosing round a person's life and seeing a happy, cod-psychotherapy conclusion than learning what trouser shape goes with what heel height. Quite where making women get naked - as Wan does - fits into any of Freud's theories is debatable, but his shows are unexpectedly affecting. In probably the best episode of How To Look Good Naked, Wan helped Kelly, a woman who had cancelled her wedding because she hated how she looked after her mastectomy, move on from complete self-loathing into becoming a radiant, confident bride. In one notable moment a still timid Kelly appeared in her new specially made bra and Wan exclaimed, \"Ding-dong, check you out, Miss Thing! It's like Jodie Marsh has arrived!\"</p> <p>In person, Wan is predictably hyper, bouncy and fast-talking, but far less OTT than he is on TV - thank heavens. He still peppers his conversation with \"absolutely\" and \"massively\", words that crop up like nervous tics, as in, \"My family are absolutely the most massive thing in my life. Oh, and fashion,\" he adds, with a bounce in his seat. \"Absolutely. Massively.\"</p> <p>Wan was born and raised in Leicester, the son of a Chinese father and an English mother, who ran a restaurant then and now a chip shop. He also has a sister, who is a lawyer, and a brother, now a martial arts expert, \"so quite a varied family, really\". Clearly a very close one, too, and his mum often comes to watch the filming of his shows. </p> <p>But it wasn't an idyllic childhood: it would have been hard enough being a mixed-race child on a Leicester council estate in the 70s \"but chuck in that I was obviously gay, 6ft 1in and 21 stone back then and I may as well have had a yellow arrow pointing at me.\" He was mainly bullied about his weight: Wan was hugely overweight throughout his childhood and teenage years, which is probably why he's so much gentler with the women on his show than his predecessors, because \"I know what it's like to look in the mirror and absolutely hate what's looking back at you, and to pick up a fashion magazine and think, why can't I look like that? It's not fair. So there's no way I would tell a woman she's looking flabby - I can't think of anything in the world more horrible.\" </p> <p>To shield himself from the bullying, he developed a \"huge, brash, pretty self-deprecating sense of humour to show that I could deal with whatever they threw at me. So actually, they probably then threw more.\" Was the bullying physical? He shifts uncomfortably. \"Oh no. You know, lots of things,\" and for the first and only time in the interview, he shuts down. </p> <p>When he was still overweight, he went to Central School of Speech and Drama to study performing arts \"and, you know, give it the full jazz hands\". But that was a pretty miserable experience, mainly because his background was so different from the typical, posher drama student. Plus, although campness is in no short supply at a drama school, obesity generally is, so I imagine that didn't help. So he returned to his parents, \"where I was allowed to be me again, which was just genius\". </p> <p>When he was 20, he decided he'd \"just had enough of this\", went on \"a bit of a crazy crash diet\", lost 11 stone, and promptly had a minor personal crisis. All his life, his weight had dictated \"everything: my personality, how people reacted to me, what I wore, everything. When you sit down with someone who's 21 stone you have certain expectations of what they're like: stupid, lazy or really fucking funny. But if you're only 10 stone, you have to work really hard to let them know who you are.\" When he was big he would wear sarongs, platforms and corsages made out of sunglasses - \"anything to show my big personality\" - but when he lost weight he retreated into jeans and trainers. \"I just needed a holiday, really, some time to blend in,\" he says. \"But I soon got back in there.\" Today he is wearing a low-key but stylish all-black outfit, with skinny jeans, a trilby and a Chanel belt - \"Love Chanel. Love it!\" he bounces.</p> <p>Despite all the bullying, he picked himself up, for which he entirely credits his family. \"With my family, all they have to do is look at me and they know what's wrong. So after [college] I was just able to go home and they helped me reconstruct myself.\"</p> <p>He soon moved into fashion styling, making a name for himself styling celebrities where he was eventually noticed by TV executives. Has his recent fame also helped his confidence? \"I think it's made me less self-confident,\" he says, with another self-mocking laugh. \"I'm certainly more paranoid and then you see these things in the papers that you didn't say, or what whoever says about you . . .\" </p> <p>It's hard not to feel that Wan sees being famous as akin to being fat: it makes him the centre of attention, both good and bad, and requires the invention of a different, more flamboyant personality. \"I don't regret having been fat at all,\" he says. \"I know how to throw jokes at myself and I use humour before anything else, and those skills allow me to do the chatshows. So I'm thankful for that.\"</p> <p>Thankful, perhaps, but, for someone who comes across as such a show off on TV, he has a decidedly dubious attitude to this persona. Wan is \"single and looking\" but his recognisability somewhat impedes the search: \"There are two types of guys I pull now - guys who I think want to know me because I'm on TV so I become very standoffish with them. Or there is the other set of guys out there who I think might genuinely quite like me but won't approach me because I'm on TV. So there you go: I'm sitting at home, watching Richard &amp; Judy and eating a Pot Noodle.\" </p> <p>More unsettling, though, is when his parents see him as a TV celebrity, instead of their son: \"I hate when I go home and see piles of magazine cuttings, or walking into the [family] chip shop and seeing a huge picture of me on the wall. That's very tough because they wouldn't do it if I weren't on TV. So I just want them to treat me as their son so I can treat them as my parents.\"</p> <p>Of course, it's not all bad. Although Wan is nervously averse to the usual side-effects of fame - \"I would never just be friends with other celebrities. What's all that about?\" - he does think, most of the time, that he is doing some good: \"What's nice about this platform is being able to show millions of people that clothes aren't just this superficial thread you put on your body. There's a massive psychology behind dressing and I think that [the programmes] have enabled people to see that. Um, I think so. I think.\"</p> <p>But go on, what should British women do to change their attitude to fashion? He perks up visibly, happy to be back on his favourite, more practised subject and promptly comes over all Christina Aguilera: \"I'm just fascinated that so many women in this country have never dealt with their low-level dysmorphia. Fascinated. British women need to embrace their natural beauty and stop hiding behind the masquerade of ill-fitting clothes and tonnes of makeup and learn to love their bodies because it will make them feel better. This may sound a little deep but we are all beautiful - we are! We need to tell each other that every day and I hate those bastards out there who say otherwise. The revolution's begun!\" And he makes a final bounce.</p> <p>\u2022 Miss Naked Beauty starts on Channel 4 tonight at 8pm</p>",
  "<p>As a dietetics student, Alison Roberts was determined to give her two-year-old son a healthy diet. While she was learning about nutrition and health, her son attended a day nursery on the university campus where she was studying. Then Angel Delight appeared on the menu. While the powdered dessert may be fondly remembered by many children of the 1970s and 1980s, Roberts was not impressed.</p> <p>\"It's full of additives,\" she says. \"I didn't give my son anything with additives at home - I didn't want him having them at nursery.\" </p> <p>But when she approached the nursery manager, he was reluctant to stop serving Angel Delight, claiming the children found it comforting. \"It was complete madness,\" says Roberts. \"He also claimed it wasn't fair to serve healthy food all the time because some children weren't used to that kind of food at home.\" </p> <p><strong>Off the menu</strong></p> <p>With the nursery refusing to budge, she gathered support from fellow parents. A meeting was called, and parents voiced their concerns. After two months, Angel Delight was taken off the menu. </p> <p>Two years on, Roberts laughs about her Angel Delight campaign, but says it does raise a serious point about nutritional standards in nurseries. \"I think most nurseries try to provide healthy, nutritious food these days. The problem is, one person's idea of a healthy diet can be 'unhealthy' for another.\" </p> <p>Judy More, a paediatric dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, agrees. In a recent article for the Journal of Family Care - for professionals working with babies and young children - she argued that day nurseries and childminders often lack the expertise to provide healthy, balanced diets. \"Generally, I'd say carers are trying to get it right, but lack of support and guidance means some are still getting it wrong.\" </p> <p>\"Getting it wrong\" does not necessarily mean filling children with junk food. A study carried out by East Sussex county council trading standards team in 10 nurseries last year found that many were \"confused and misinformed\" about healthy eating for under-fives. In fact, many nurseries were providing diets that were too low in calories, fat and saturated fat and too high in fruit and vegetables. </p> <p>More wasn't surprised. She cites one example of a multicultural nursery that decided it would be easier to cater for the children's varying dietary needs by providing an all-vegetarian menu. But there were no iron-rich foods such as pulses or nuts to replace the excluded meat and fish. So the menu was too low in iron to meet the needs of preschool children. </p> <p>With toddlers and pre-school children in the UK spending more and more time in nurseries and other childcare facilities, the issue has never been so important. With all three- and four-year-olds now entitled to 12.5 hours of free early years education (from 2010 this will rise to 15 hours), many children regularly have at least one meal in day care each day. </p> <p>And figures from the Department of Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) show the number of full day care providers has been rising steadily since 2001, meaning more and more children are having breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks away from home. </p> <p>For parents, who may feel they have little control over what their child eats while in day care, it can be a worry. \"I'm not too happy that my daughter's nursery insists on only giving fruit for snacks,\" says Julie Thornton. \"I give her plenty of fruit at home with her meals, but I think toddlers need to snack on something more substantial. I see nothing wrong with the odd biscuit or piece of cake, but that is just not allowed in her nursery.\" </p> <p><strong>Pudding is important</strong></p> <p>More agrees, saying: \"There is nothing wrong with biscuits or cake as long as they are made from good ingredients. People are often surprised when I advise children should have a pudding after lunch and dinner, but young children need to keep up their calorie intake. Some sugary foods are OK in the context of a healthy, balanced diet.\" </p> <p>Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), the representative body for day nurseries in the UK, says an added pressure for nurseries is that parents can be misinformed about what constitutes a healthy diet for children. \"Parents are increasingly interested in what their children are being given at nursery. However, in some cases, nurseries may be serving food that is too healthy for the under-fives. Young children should not be served low-fat versions of foods or skimmed milk, and nurseries do sometimes face barriers when explaining this to parents.\" </p> <p>There is no shortage of good work going on around healthy eating in early-years settings. Healthy eating is one of the topics in the National Childminding Association's diploma in home-based childcare. The NDNA also has worked with registered dieticians to develop publications and training programmes on healthy eating. The Pre-School Learning Alliance, a charity specialising in early-years education, has developed a nutritional guidance and healthy eating programme along with the British Nutrition Foundation. </p> <p>But what is desperately needed, says More, is a more \"joined-up\" approach, and a set of national nutritional standards for preschool children, such as those set out by the government for primary and secondary aged children. The new Early Years Framework, which sets out the standards for the Early Years Foundation Stage - birth to five years - states that any meals, snacks or drinks should be balanced, healthy and nutritious, and fresh water must be available at all times. The DCSF provides guidance materials on nursery food, but with growing numbers of children in day care, More doesn't believe this goes far enough. </p> <p>\"Good nutrition is vital for preschool children's growth and development, as nutritional problems such as iron-deficiency anaemia, constipation and dental caries are common in this age group. Good eating habits, set down at an early age, can have a significant impact on long-term health.\" Instead of low-fat, low-sugar meals and snacks, day-care centres should provide a healthy, balanced diet that contains all the right nutrients to help children to grow and develop. </p> <p>And Angel Delight? According to More, it is not the devil's food. \"Angel Delight is a milk product that can be used as one of the three servings of dairy products recommended for children each day. My children had it every week!\"</p>",
  "<p>Nine months before the Ashes series gets under way in Cardiff, Cameron White gave plenty of amusement to English watchers yesterday when he speared a delivery so far down the leg-side that it made Steve Harmison's infamous series opener in 2006 look like a model of line-and-length bowling.</p> <p>It was one of the widest deliveries anyone could remember, and came as India stretched their lead rapidly towards infinity, turning an overnight advantage into total mastery on the fourth day of the second Test in Mohali. They require only five wickets to complete victory over Australia. Barring a fightback of Steve Waugh-like ferocity - or rain - Australia will today go one down in the four-match series. It would be only a second defeat in 29 Tests since the <br>2005 Ashes.</p> <p>Set 516 to win, they were five down in a blink. Harbhajan Singh - centre of an angry row in their last ill-tempered series - removed his arch foe, Matthew Hayden, and two more top-order batsmen, while Ishant Sharma took two, including Ricky Ponting for the third time in a row. Michael Clarke, with an unbeaten 42, and the new keeper, Brad Haddin, staged a recovery of sorts as Australia ended on 141 for five.</p> <p>In the morning, India had rapidly extended their lead. A second Test hundred for the opener Gautam Gambhir and punchy innings from Virender Sehwag and MS Dhoni established total control, which led to a prickly exchange between the captain, Ponting, and his fastest bowler, Brett Lee, who felt he should have been handed the ball earlier. Dhoni - standing in for the injured Anil Kumble - declared India's second innings closed at 314 for three, leaving Australia with a daunting chase.</p> <p>After a death-or-glory 29 the ageing Hayden failed for the fourth time in a row, with Harbhajan so delighted he may yet be punished for his celebration.</p>",
  "<p>Friends and dedicated enemies all agree that life is rarely dull for long around Peter Mandelson. Newly restored to cabinet as business secretary, he popped up on the Sunday TV sofa to set a pack of hares running in all directions.</p> <p>Yesterday colleagues set about shooting them. </p> <p>A retreat on Labour's flexible working time reforms to help ease business's problems in what he prefers to call the economic \"contraction\"? </p> <p>Labour MPs didn't like the sound of that. </p> <p>Nor did feminists or the unions. </p> <p>Part-privatisation of the Royal Mail? Ditto, though they were happier with his promise to make sure that uncontrite banks treat their customers properly.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson faces a grilling from MPs on the business, enterprise and regulatory reform (BERR) select committee today. They are braced for smooth answers, but not specific ones. Some even expect him to add to the recent list of U-turns by retreating on unpopular post office closures. </p> <p>Fat chance. With subsidies running at \u00a3500,000 a day (modest by bank standards), 2,500 out of 14,000 post offices are slated to go. </p> <p>That still leaves only 4,000 commercially viable - as changing habits and new technology, much of it promoted by rival government agencies (pensions, benefits, licences, all handled online), undermine their traditional functions, more loved than used. </p> <p>As with post offices, so with the Royal Mail. </p> <p>BERR officials last night seemed to be distancing the boss from an FT report quoting Mandelson as saying his hopes for part-privatisation would have been fulfilled when he last ran the department had he not been forced out in 1998. </p> <p>He is politely awaiting a review of the flagging service from Richard Hooper, the former deputy chairman of Ofcom.</p> <p>As the current Postcomm team backs a partial sale to generate the necessary capital (\"not enough capital, too much labour\" snaps one ex-minister), as did ex-postie Alan Johnson when he had Mandelson's job, Hooper is likely to agree. Even Vince Cable, arch bank nationaliser, says so too.</p> <p>But there are problems. The communications union (UCW), a major Labour donor, is opposed. So are many Labour MPs who have Gordon Brown on probation. He didn't used to be keen either. </p> <p>Any would-be buyer would want the good bits (Parcelforce?), but not the millstone of the Royal Mail's pension fund (\u00a33.4bn and rising). Ministers might want a cash \"dowry\" to help support the post office network.</p> <p>Last time the option was seriously discussed when Patricia Hewitt was in charge, no one was willing to pay a decent price. So who today would want to buy a chunk of regulated state industry with a Universal Service Obligation (delivering letters to Stornaway and Southgate for the same stamp price) when world markets are in turmoil? </p> <p>Ministers get clobbered either way. Across Europe most successful mail services were liberalised long ago. Even La Poste, France's long-resistant state monopoly, has now embraced competition and private capital. </p> <p>Hobbled by ministerial indecision, growing competition and its own failings the Royal Mail must catch up or perish. </p> <p>It needn't, but it could.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday October 22 2008. We previously described Richard Hooper, who is chairing a review of UK postal services, as a former Postcomm regulator. He is a former deputy chairman of Ofcom, but has had no involvement with Postcomm. This has been corrected. </p>",

  "<p>When pro-choice demonstrators gather outside parliament today, they really will have cause to protest. In an extraordinary stitch-up, the government has cheated its way out of the abortion debate that was scheduled to be part of tomorrow's human fertilisation and embryology bill. Campaigners are blistering with fury that procedural sleight of hand will deny the chance to reform the forty-year old abortion act.</p> <p>The government has agreed to let all abortion amendments slip to the bottom, with no time to debate them. Their stated reason is a fear that if reforming abortion amendments are included when the bill goes to the Lords, the upper house may overturn them and instead of making progressive reforms, revert to a harsher time limit and other restrictions. The Lib Dem MP Evan Harris, a leading reformer, rejects this argument out of hand, with plenty of evidence that the Lords has repeatedly voted pro-abortion and strongly supports the whole bill.</p> <p>What's behind this? A simple miscalculation about the nature of the Lords? Unlikely since it has in recent years voted eight times in favour of abortion and embryo issues. Harris accuses Labour of political cowardice and fearing to support pro-abortion reforms.</p> <p>Here's the case for reform: the 1967 abortion law casts women as too morally unreliable to decide if they should become mothers. Two doctors must agree that a pregnancy can be terminated; women must plead psychological cause and attend a registered clinic. All that adds to cruel delays: some women still wait six weeks.</p> <p>Doctors are not making a medical diagnosis, but giving or withholding their moral blessing. Not surprisingly, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists wants an end to this archaic hypocrisy. In these days of \"choice\" and \"empowerment\" for patients, doctors are not priests. How odd that women should be morally incapable of making this most important decision and yet might be compelled against their will to become mothers - presumably morally incompetent ones.</p> <p>Tomorrow's debate was due to be a tug of war between pro- and anti-abortion amendments. Reformers wanted modest change: one doctor to sign instead of two; nurses able to administer pills for early abortions; and women allowed to take those pills at a GP clinic, to make it quicker and cheaper.</p> <p>Maybe the government took fright at eye-popping anti-abortion propaganda, with the Daily Mail trumpeting \"Girls aged 12 could get abortion drugs\", and citing the MP Nadine Dorries' lurid images of 12-year-olds home alone \"experiencing pain like they've never thought possible, bleeding like they never imagined and then flushing their own abortions down the toilet\".</p> <p>After failing to cut the abortion limit to 20 weeks, Dorries and others put down amendments demanding a signature from three doctors, including a psychiatrist; compulsory counselling on the merits of adoption; warnings of the \"psychological risks\" of abortion; and a seven-day \"cooling-off period\". Worst of all, they want to restrict the definition of a \"seriously handicapped\" foetus and ban all abortions after 24 weeks, even in the case of anencephaly, where there is no chance of survival.</p> <p>But there is no reason to think any of these would have passed. The suspicion remains that the reason why the government dished the whole debate is Diane Abbott's crucial amendment to extend abortion to Northern Ireland, resisted ferociously by all Northern Ireland parties and by the government. When this bill was debated in May, ministers browbeat Labour MPs to drop it with extreme warnings that the Northern Ireland peace agreement would collapse. One MP described the pressure of being told that a secret tipping point in the peace process had been reached, and that very week was make or break. The MP broke. There has been no evidence of such a tipping point, but the frighteners behind the speaker's chair were highly effective.</p> <p>Despite adamant denials, many are convinced that Labour made a dirty deal with the Democratic Unionists to keep abortion out of Northern Ireland in exchange for votes to squeak through Gordon Brown's 42-day detention bill.</p> <p>Abortion is one issue that binds Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP, SDLP and Ulster Unionists in an eternal blood brotherhood. Feminists in Northern Ireland refer to the power-sharing government as \"the taliban\". Some 50,000 Northern Irish women have had to come to England for abortions, costing about \u00a32,500 each, while poorer women bear unwanted children or use back-street methods: over 10% of GPs admit to dealing with the aftermath of amateur abortions.</p> <p>Denying fundamental rights to Northern Irish women fits uncomfortably well with the long dishonourable record of Westminster's regard for human rights in the province. Trade-offs have always meant different rules apply. The Commons could impose an abortion law on Northern Ireland, but once full powers are restored to Stormont, there will be nothing to stop the assembly repealing it. However, the brave and much-persecuted abortion campaigners in Northern Ireland think it unlikely the assembly would revert to the present outright ban on abortion. Attitudes are shifting: a Northern Ireland poll yesterday showed 62% would support abortion in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>However, opinion polls are consistently anti-abortion on other grounds in the province, so shouldn't they be allowed self-determination? Is this another kind of imperialism? Not if you believe individual women have an inalienable right over their own bodies. Not if you think the imposition of unwanted motherhood is as monstrous an intrusion on a woman's liberty as imprisonment without trial. This should not be a question of majority decision-making, but of as fundamental a human right as any in the UN charter, to be protected from the tyranny of the majority. No one is making anyone else have an abortion. Northern Ireland's politicians have no right to conspire across party lines against the minority rights of women citizens in need of abortions - 40 a week.</p> <p>If underhand arrangements mean dropping the debate, it'll be yet another dirty Northern Ireland deal. Today at 5.30pm outside the Commons they will be shouting the old cry: \"Not the church, not the state, women must decide their fate.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/harrietharman\">Harriet Harman</a> is planning to block a series of Commons votes tomorrow to liberalise Britain's abortion laws, which could have overturned a ban in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>, in a move that was condemned as \"disgraceful\". To the dismay of pro-choice MPs, Harman is planning to argue that Britain's liberal abortion laws could be threatened in the House of Lords if MPs tamper with any aspect of the law. It was last changed in 1990.</p> <p>The leader of the Commons has been saying in private that one key liberal element of the law - that the 24-week upper time limit does not apply in cases of severely disabled foetuses - could be overturned by peers if MPs change the abortion laws.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris last night condemned Harman's argument, saying: \"That is a completely spurious allegation to give cover. It would be a disgraceful move if the government, having permitted anti-abortion amendments to reduce the time limit to be voted on at committee stage [in May], now prevents by a ploy a free vote on pro-choice reforms of the abortion law.\"</p> <p>MPs are planning to table three amendments to liberalise Britain's abortion laws when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/stemcells\">human fertilisation and embryology (HFE) bill</a> is debated by MPs for the final time tomorrow. The changes would have allowed one doctor to sanction an abortion, by ending the \"two doctor\" rule; permitted nurses to perform abortions; and legalised abortions in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Anti-abortion MPs, whose attempts to cut the 24-week upper limit were blocked in May, have also been planning their own amendments. They want a committee of MPs and peers to report within nine months on whether to change the abortion laws.</p> <p>Harman, who spoke in favour of the latest pro-choice amendments from the opposition benches when a similar embryology bill was debated in 1990, is planning to invoke a special Commons procedure to block any vote on abortion. It is expected that she will introduce a procedural motion to decide the order in which MPs debate the bill. The motion, which would place abortion far down the list, would be subject to a three-line whip because the HFE bill is a government bill that will be subject to a three-line whip tomorrow. Votes on abortion laws, which can only be introduced by backbenchers, are always subject to free votes.</p> <p>A government source said that Harman was acting because she feared that peers would overturn liberalising abortion amendments, and then turn the clock back. \"This bill is not the right vehicle to open up abortion laws,\" one government source said. \"There could be unintended consequences.\"</p> <p>But there was speculation last night that the government was acting to please the main political parties in Northern Ireland who are united in supporting the ban on abortions in the province. Some members of the Democratic Unionist party said its nine MPs voted in favour of the government's plan to detain terror suspects without charge for 42 days in June after ministers assured Northern Ireland's parties that the abortion ban would be retained.</p> <p>The government wrote to all Northern Ireland parties saying that the HFE bill would be the wrong vehicle to change the law in Northern Ireland. Harris said: \"If that is right, then that is disgraceful.\"</p> <p>Audrey Simpson, director of the Family Planning Association in Northern Ireland, now known as the FPA, said: \"We hope that Westminster MPs will resist any pressure to drop these amendments. They are the voices for Northern Ireland women with regard to access to abortion services, as they do not have a voice in the Northern Ireland assembly.\"</p> <p>Emily Thornberry, the pro-choice Labour MP, said she had reluctantly come to terms with Harman's move. \"We want to give poor women in Northern Ireland the right to have an abortion. They are being ruled by a law from 1861 and they are supposed to be British citizens.</p> <p>\"I don't accept [the government action]. But Harriet and Jan [Royall, the leader of the House of Lords] are liberal-minded, pro-choice women. If they tell me it's not possible, what do you do? It breaks your heart - but what do you do?\"</p> <p>Nadine Dorries, a Conservative MP, said the government was in a mess. \"If the government didn't want abortion put into this bill they should have drafted it in a way that it couldn't happen. All they had to do was draft the long title accordingly. But Caroline Flint was the minister then and she wanted abortion to go on this bill, because the government was so arrogant they thought a whole series of liberalising amendments would go through.\"</p>",

Miller, a late convert to teaching, had been in the profession for only five years when he was asked by a teacher training college to tutor trainees in the creative way he used computers in the classroom.</p> <p>In his former life, Miller had started a computer software company and worked for Glasgow's arts festival. He'd also found time to have music he had composed published. Then, six years ago, his \"teaching moment\" came. He was working as a lay member of a children's panel. The panels, distinctive to the Scottish youth justice system, are made up of trained volunteers who sit at the hearings of children under 16 with convictions, family or social troubles and decide how the children can be helped.</p> <p>\"I kept thinking to myself how lucky I'd been with my background and my supportive parents,\" he says. \"I just realised what I really wanted to do was work with children.\"</p> <p><strong>Poetry emotion</strong></p> <p>Miller is now an English teacher and in charge of English trainee teachers at St Ninian's high school in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, near Glasgow, where he started his teaching career.</p> <p>This year's Teaching Awards judges can't speak highly enough of the lessons we observed him teach. In one, on what makes a poem, Miller captivated students with photos and a film clip closely tied to the poem Out, Out - by Robert Frost, on the accidental death of a child. He then read them the poem with what one judge says was \"such emotion that he brought an eerie silence and chill to the lecture theatre\". \"As the bell went and David brought the lesson to a close, the class gave a spontaneous round of applause. The lesson will remain in my memory for a very long time, and there was every indication that this was not a special effort but a very typical lesson.\"</p> <p>Another judge who sat in on the lesson says: \"The lesson showed his flexible and inspiring use of technology. His questioning technique was exemplary, with one question followed up by another. Students were praised for their answers and there was the same quality of engagement with all the students.\"</p> <p>In another lesson, Miller managed to tease out the complex themes of Robert Browning's poem Porphyria's Lover with 13- and 14-year-olds. One judge, a former headteacher, says: \"I have never felt myself to be as much of a learner as the pupils being taught. David did not tell the class what they should think, but engaged them so thoroughly that they were able to articulate their own thoughts. I would not have imagined that literary appreciation could have been so effectively taught to so young an age group.\" \"He used technology creatively, effectively and effortlessly, rather than for show,\" says another judge who observed the lesson.</p> <p>Miller's teaching style keeps pupils captivated, almost enchanted, and desperate to please and contribute. \"He teaches big classes, but you feel he's teaching you one-to-one,\" says one pupil. \"It's as though he's never done the lesson before. It's so fresh,\" says another. Suzanne, a trainee teacher at St Ninian's, says when she first observed one of his lessons she told herself \"this is what I need to be like\".</p> <p>Miller's academically most-able pupils say his \"discussion-based\" classes were the best preparation they could have received for university and university interviews. \"He gave us a very broad education,\" says former pupil Claire McKeen. But his talent extends to students of all abilities. Miller's colleagues and the award's judges testify that his lessons encourage ambition and cultivate self-reliance in almost every one of his students.</p> <p>Ultimately, Miller says, he sees his role as \"civilising the students\". No wonder, then, that he plays such an important part in extra-curricular activities. He's busy \"civilising\" pupils onstage as they rehearse school shows, on trips abroad and after school and at the weekend at the climbing classes he's started.</p> <p>Iain MacNamara, a parent, has helped out with some of the school's theatre productions. \"He brings children out of themselves,\" he says. \"He's got those who normally stand in the background dancing centre stage. I've seen how he inspires them.\"</p> <p>How many teachers could get teenage boys dancing in Calamity Jane, asks John Kelly, St Ninian's deputy headteacher. \"He'll bring on board pupils who are at the very least cynical. The kind of boy you would never expect to see in a school show is there.\"</p> <p>For Miller, this is not about choosing the best cast for a showstopper, it's about \"civilising his students by developing their confidence\", his colleagues say. \"He believes he is there to make wee Jenny the best in all she does,\" says one.</p> <p>Miller's list of accomplishments extends well beyond teaching to being a talented painter and pianist and fluent speaker of Italian. It's a wonder that he isn't despised out of jealousy. Instead, wherever he goes, he is adored. On a school trip to Tanzania two years ago, Masai tribesmen slaughtered a goat in honour of Miller. They then presented him with the most cherished part - the kidney.</p> <p>\"Neither of my children are the kind to gush about teachers and yet they gushed about David as all the other kids did,\" says Angela Pattoni, a parent.</p> <p><strong>'Great enthusiasm'</strong></p> <p>\"He jokes with us, but there aren't discipline problems in his lessons because we respect him,\" says one pupil. They even let him get away with calling them \"pet\". \"He makes you feel positive. He's always smiling,\" says another. \"Even when he's had a day of teaching, he walks into rehearsals with great enthusiasm as though it's the best thing in the world.\"</p> <p>Miller will go beyond what is expected of teachers if it helps his students to develop. One pupil says he convinced her not to leave school at 16. \"Ever since, he's been emailing me about public-speaking competitions and things like that because he knows I enjoy them,\" she says.</p> <p>He has registered his students at Glasgow University library so that they can use specialist books for their dissertations. One year,he even got a part in a high-profile production of Guys and Dolls in Glasgow so that he could bring back the dance routines and use them in a school show. \"I'm in my final year at university and he is still helping me,\" says one ex-pupil.</p> <p>Miller has no children of his own and says he enjoys the company of his students. \"If he tries a new hobby, he'll ask the students if they want to come too,\" says Ann Marini. Another parent says the first thing Miller thought about when he broke his wrist was not how much pain he was in, but that he wouldn't be able to make the school trip. </p> <p>Miller is also a meticulous record keeper. His notes show exactly where every pupil is up to. His students say he marks work \"immediately\" and parents confirm that he is a \"first-class communicator\".</p> <p>There must be something bad someone can say about Miller, surely? Annoyingly not. \"He's a promoter of peace,\" says Father McMahon, St Ninian's school chaplain. \"This is a teacher the students are going to be talking about in their 30s, 40s and beyond,\" says one parent. \"It's not thought that there's a teacher like him in Scotland,\" says Kelly. \"Simply the best teacher I can imagine,\" concludes one of his pupils.</p> <p>\u2022 Jessica Shepherd was among the judges for the Guardian award </p> <h2>Guardian award for teacher of the year in a secondary school</h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>David Miller</strong>, St Ninian's high (Scotland); <strong>Stephen Craggs</strong>, Ansford school (West); <strong>Nicola Stanfield</strong>, Haybridge high school and sixth form (West Midlands); <strong>Sheila Bevins</strong>, Cardiff high (Wales); <strong>James Gregory</strong>, Devonport high school for girls (South-west); <strong>Meeghan Tearle</strong>, Cantell maths and computing college (South); <strong>Howard Wood</strong>, Oathall community college (South-east); <strong>Shelia McFall</strong>, St Rose's girls' high (Northern Ireland); <strong>Martin Vevers</strong>, Cheadle Hulme high (North-west); <strong>Geoff Hatch</strong>, Joseph Rowntree school (North); <strong>Ian Redford</strong>, Thornhill school business &amp; enterprise college (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Michelle Day</strong>, Emerson Park school (London); <strong>Angela Gibbons</strong>, Greensward college (East); <strong>Helen Brittain</strong>, William Farr CE comprehensive (East Midlands)</p> <h2>Do you know next year's winner?</h2> <p>Do you think your teacher is the best ever?

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338785356\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility yesterday for the murder of a British aid worker in Kabul, accusing her of spreading Christianity. Gayle Williams, 34, was shot dead by two men on a motorcycle as she walked to the office of the Christian charity Serve.</p> <p>Aid organisations in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> were last night assessing the security risks for their staff in response to the murder. So far this year, 29 aid workers, either foreign or Afghans employed by one of the 100-plus agencies in the country, have been killed.</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the shooting. \"This woman came to Afghanistan to teach Christianity to the people of Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Our [leaders] issued a decree to kill this woman. This morning our people killed her in Kabul.\"</p> <p>The street where the killing took place is wide and dusty, with few shops and many villas surrounded by high walls. The area is popular with NGOs and foreign companies.</p> <p>\"After I heard the shots I came and she was lying there,\" said a police officer, Dei Agha, pointing at the pavement. \"She was covered with blood, we put her in a police pick up truck and took her to the morgue.\" </p> <p>Mullah Azizullah, imam of the nearby Shir Sham Mina mosque, called last Friday for the people to stop missionaries and proselytising activities. \"We know for sure that the foreigners are proselytising Christianity in Afghanistan, some of them do it in daylight and others undercover,\" he said. \"I took a list of their institutions to the intelligence, the police and the ministry of religious guidance but they didn't do anything. The sharia calls for the killing of those who convert and the people who proselytise should be killed too.\"</p> <p>A resident, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian he had informed local Islamic organisations that \"this NGO and specifically this woman are involved in converting Muslims. She has been living here for a long time and everyone knew what she was doing\". Williams, who worked with disabled people, had recently been pulled out of Kandahar in the south, where she had been running a community project, because it was judged to be too dangerous. </p> <p>Mike Lyth, the Carlisle-based chairman of the board of Serve (Serving Emergency Relief and Vocational Enterprises), said Williams had been working with the group for two and a half years, helping to rehabilitate disabled people into the community. He said that she would have changed her route to work or the time of the journey every day.</p> <p>He dismissed the Taliban's claim that Williams was killed because she was spreading Christianity. \"That's just an opportunistic jumping on the bandwagon,\" he said. \"It certainly has no truth to it at all. We are Christians - that is what gives us the motivation to go into a dangerous and difficult country to try to help but she was not involved in proselytisation.\" He said Serve had a strict non-proselytising policy. Some Taliban claims of responsibility for killings in Afghanistan have turned out to be inaccurate in recent years.</p> <p>Lyth paid tribute to Williams as \"the life and soul of the party\". He added: \"She did find it difficult [in Afghanistan], because women find it difficult there anyway, but she loved what she did and she had a love for the Afghan people.\" </p> <p>Serve employs 200 Afghan staff but will now take a \"long, hard look\" at its operations, he added. \"Each time something like this happens, you wonder - do you go on exposing people to unnecessary risk? Yet at the same time you have got the cry of many, many of the Afghans saying: 'Please help us'. You're caught between a rock and a hard place.\" </p> <p>Louise Gearing, a friend who met Williams when the charity worker led a weekly discussion group for Christian worshippers, said: \"She was an amazing lady. She was loving, she was caring, and she was willing to want to make a change for the better.\" Williams was brought up in South Africa but lived in Britain for some time before going to Afghanistan. She had dual nationality and had been an active member of the evangelical Hillsong church in London, where her mother lives.</p> <p>Other aid agencies expressed concern. \"We are worried about the deteriorating security situation,\" said Sarah Wilson of Christian Aid. \"We are known for not proselytising and we don't have a sign on our door. We have pulled international staff out of Iraq but we will continue to work in Afghanistan, although we take the security situation very seriously.\" The international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, said: \"It was with great sadness that I heard about the death of Gayle Williams ... To suggest her killing was a religious act is as despicable as it is absurd.\"</p>",
  "<p>The public finances fell to a record deficit last month, driven down by a weakening economy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy\">government overspending</a>, and analysts say much worse is to come as the economy tips into recession.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said public sector net <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/debt\">borrowing</a> was higher than expected at \u00a38.1bn last month, a record for a September and almost double the \u00a34.8bn shortfall of September 2007. </p> <p>That left the cumulative borrowing for the first half of the 2008/09 fiscal year at \u00a337.6bn compared with \u00a321.5bn in the same period a year ago and the highest since records began in 1946.</p> <p>\"The September public finances were dreadful, deteriorating even more than expected,\" said Howard Archer, economist at consultancy Global Insight. \"This highlights the extremely poor state of the public finances as they are hit by past largesse, the marked economic slowdown ... weak housing market activity, rising unemployment and government policy concessions since the March budget.\" </p> <p>In his March budget Alistair Darling forecast a shortfall for the 2008/09 fiscal year to March of \u00a343bn. But yesterday's figures show that total has been almost reached halfway through the year, meaning he will have to increase the figure in next month's pre-budget report. </p> <p>In a Commons statement yesterday the prime minister, Gordon Brown, also signalled that the government's fiscal rules - designed to stop public finances spinning out of control - may be abandoned. </p> <p>Arguing that British net public debt is well below European levels, he said greater borrowing was justifiable to avert an economic downturn. \"Like all governments across the world, we are considering how fiscal policy can support the economy at this time,\" he said. \"Carefully targeted, rigorously worked-through investments that help people fairly through the downturn and lay the foundations for stronger growth in the future. </p> <p>\"And in Britain's case we can start from the position of low public debt.\" </p> <p>David Cameron said a further public spending splurge was wrong and said Britain could be heading for a record budget deficit. </p> <p>Brown said: \"With interest rates low and falling, inflation expected to come down over the next year, these underlying economic indicators - particularly interest rates - make us stronger than at any other previous downturn.</p> <p>\"Debt has been considerably lower than a decade ago, and lower than all G7 countries except Canada, enabling the government to increase borrowing at the right time to support the economy.</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Brown had ignored their advice for years about the \"unsustainable nature of the credit and housing boom\".</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the growing deficit was down to spending running ahead of the March budget plans and tax revenues coming in lower.</p> <p>\"If these trends continue, public sector net borrowing will come in around \u00a364bn this year,\" said Gemma Tatlow, an IFS economist. \"If the government had acted earlier to address its repeatedly optimistic forecasts for public finances, we would not now be embarking on a recession with public sector borrowing and debt as high as they are.\"</p> <p>She said it was right that the government was planning to let borrowing rise as the recession took hold. \"But the pain cannot be delayed forever: once the current crisis abates, this government or its successor is likely to have to introduce a combination of new tax-raising measures and further spending cuts,\" she said.</p> <p>The national debt ticked up to 43% of national income including the Northern Rock liabilities that are now on the public finances, or 38% if they are excluded.</p> <p>One bright spot was that Northern Rock had reduced its impact on the national debt from \u00a3100bn to \u00a382bn over the past nine months as it has repaid a significant chunk of its government loan.</p> <p>The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, an economic thinktank, predicted that borrowing would reach about \u00a360bn this year but rise to \u00a392bn in 2009/10, equivalent to 6% of national income. Some economists are predicting it could be \u00a3100bn or more.</p> <p>Philip Hammond, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, acknowledged that \"borrowing always rises when the economy slows\", but added: \"Gordon Brown's failure to prepare means that borrowing has reached record levels before we've seen the worst of the downturn.\"</p> <p>The government's finances could be further undermined because of a fall in the tax revenues from big businesses.</p> <p>According to a report by the House of Commons' public accounts committee published today about two-thirds of the corporation tax paid by the UK's 700 largest companies in 2005/06 comes from just three sectors: insurance, oil and gas - which has benefited from the high oil prices - and the banking industry, which has taken the brunt of the fallout from the global credit crunch.</p> <p>Local authorities are also facing the prospect of falling revenues as a result of the downturn. One report suggests the slowdown could cut the amount paid through the business rate over last year and the current financial year by \u00a32.5bn.</p>",
  "<p>Jamie Oliver's latest healthy eating campaign is being taken up by local authorities, with one already bidding for money to set up a drop-in cooking centre like the one the celebrity chef started in Rotherham earlier this year. </p> <p>Yesterday Oliver wrote to key government ministers to demand funding for a Food Centre in every British town where people can learn to cook.</p> <p>Bradford, Scarborough and Hull councils have all told the Guardian they are keen to replicate Oliver's Ministry of Food initiative, showcased on his Channel 4 show, which ends today. Bradford is preparing a bid for money which may include a proposal for its own Ministry of Food centre, despite the inaugural Rotherham branch causing controversy among locals. </p> <p>Many are furious that the city council and Rotherham NHS have agreed to pay over \u00a3100,000 to keep it open for a year, with several opposition politicians accusing the council of subsidising Oliver's empire at the expense of local needy people. </p> <p>Yesterday bemused onlookers munched pasties from nearby Greggs as they peered through the glass-fronted fa\u00e7ade at the shop in Rotherham's pedestrian precinct. </p> <p>They were watching a group of adults on a scheme for the long-term unemployed learning how to cook healthy blueberry pancakes and mushroom omelettes. Inside Paul Clements, out of work for 14 months, was learning to crack an egg without getting the shell in the bowl.</p> <p>Also on hand was Mick \"the miner\" Trueman, on a day off from his job at Maltby colliery. Trueman has become a favourite of Jamie's Ministry of Food viewers by transforming from a man who declared that cooking is for \"poofs\" to taking over all kitchen duties from his wife. </p> <p>As he walked out of the shop yesterday, a group of women pounced on him for recipe advice. </p> <p>One of Oliver's big ideas is the Pass It On scheme, which encourages people to learn a recipe, teach it to two people, who pass it on to another two until the world can cook.</p> <p>Next door, in Thornton's chocolate shop, sales assistant Debbie Johnson said she was forever hearing ill-tempered grumbles from locals passing the Ministry of Food. </p> <p>\"We're always hearing people walking past chuntering about him. Since the programme has been on, no one has been positive.\"</p> <p>The first episode of Oliver's programme angered many in Rotherham after it showed a young mother who didn't know what boiling water looked like and another who fed her two children kebabs and chips with cheese every night from her kitchen floor. \"It made us all look stupid,\" said Johnson. \"It even made me ashamed of being from Rotherham.\"</p> <p>One local, who does not want to be named, has even set up a blog called Jamie Go Home, which aims to speak out \"against celebrity worship, the nanny state, corporate greed, media manipulation, regional stereotyping, cultural elitism and hypocrisy\".</p> <p>One posting said: \"Those of us who live in the town know that the 'movement' has had little or no effect on 99% of Rotherham people.\" Another said: \"If you are involved in Ministry of Food - I hope you are getting paid as much as the people Jamie pretends to be friends with in his adverts. You are basically playing the same role - background artiste in a marketing campaign to boost the \u00a320m plus fortune of Jamie Oliver MBE.\"</p> <p>Tony Mannion, a Conservative councillor on the Labour-run Rotherham council, said: \"I am absolutely astounded that we are subsidising Jamie Oliver and Channel 4 to make programmes. </p> <p>\"There are plenty of schemes in Rotherham that could make far better use of the money. </p> <p>\"It beggars belief that a multimillionaire and one of the UK's biggest TV stations are getting money from us.\"</p> <p>Oliver's spokesman yesterday confirmed that the proceeds of the Ministry of Food cook book, which accompanies the series, would not go to charity. </p> <p>He also said that Oliver was heading to the Netherlands this week to try to start his Pass It On scheme there and in Germany.</p> <p>Mannion blamed Rotherham council's involvement in the project on an obsession with celebrity, which led to Dolly Parton being invited to Rotherham late last year to launch a local branch of a scheme she devised to improve children's literacy.</p> <p>He said: \"It's no surprise to me that they were so keen to get involved with Jamie Oliver, because this council is absolutely obsessed by celebrities. As soon as you mention a celebrity's name they fall over themselves to do something for them.\"</p> <p>But cooking convert Mick Trueman has no time for such cynicism. \"Some people say it won't work, but they're the kind of people who would have seen the first motor car or aeroplane and said 'it'll never work'; the kind of people who would win the lottery and complain that they didn't like the handwriting on the cheque. </p> <p>\"People said now that Jamie has gone home it'll all fall apart, but they are wrong. This is just the beginning.\"</p>",
  "<p>William Hill has bolstered its underperforming internet operations by combining forces with Playtech, the Aim-listed gaming software specialist.</p> <p>Playtech will take a 29% stake in a new online gaming and sports betting operation, William Hill Online, in return for folding in $250m (\u00a3145m) worth of newly acquired affiliate businesses with a strong supply of customers as well as \"marketing and customer retention expertise\".</p> <p>William Hill, which will put its existing online assets into the joint venture, will own the rest of William Hill Online and have full operational control, retaining an option to buy out Playtech's share in four or six years' time. It has also agreed to use Playtech's software for poker and casino games for at least five years.</p> <p>Chief executive Ralph Topping said William Hill had been unable to build up its own online business from its headquarters in Leeds, so had to buy in expertise. </p> <p>Operating across Europe in undisclosed locations, the newly acquired businesses would pick up customers and \"funnel\" them to the William Hill network, he said. \"It's a simple model but there's a hell of a lot going on at the back to make it happen.\"</p> <p>William Hill has struggled to bring in sufficiently large numbers of internet gamblers at a time when the online market is growing in importance. \"We could not stay the way we were, it was not an option - we were weak,\" Topping said. \"This deal strengthens us. It was the right thing to do; we will have a much, much stronger business over the course of the next four years.\"</p> <p>Most of the $250m being paid by Playtech for the affiliates is accounted for by Uniplay, a business controlled by Playtech's founder and main shareholder, 36-year-old Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi. </p> <p>Playtech still has an option to buy another five affiliates controlled by Sagi, who made a reported \u00a370m when he floated Playtech in 2006 and still retains a 41% stake in the business, worth \u00a3370m. Chief executive Mor Weizer said these other affiliates would \"not necessarily\" end up joining William Hill Online.</p> <p>Topping dismissed fears that the recession could hurt the gambling industry. \"You've still got to enjoy yourself. A couple of quid on a horse or 10 or 12 quid at the weekend, it's part and parcel of the fabric of UK life - I don't think people will give that up.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rear Admiral Michael Kyrle Pope, who has died aged 91, spent much of his service career in intelligence and would almost certainly have risen even higher in the Royal Navy but for spending most of the second world war trying to escape from prisoner of war camps.</p> <p>Kyrle Pope was born into an old Herefordshire family. His father was a naval officer. After Wellington college, Berkshire, he joined the navy in 1934 as a special entry cadet, training on the heavy cruiser HMS Frobisher. In 1938 he volunteered for \"the trade\", as the submarine service was known from its inception before the first world war.</p> <p>In August 1940 he was third hand (after the captain and the first lieutenant) aboard HM submarine Oswald in the Mediterranean. The boat had been one of six operating from Malta when Italy entered the war on June 10 1940. Six weeks later, on patrol between Sicily and Sardinia, the vessel was rammed by an Italian destroyer. The steering was damaged and one of the two engines was immobilised, leaving her circling slowly on the surface. </p> <p>The captain, Lieutenant Commander David Fraser, gave the order to abandon ship and to scuttle. Kyrle Pope was the only officer below deck and could see that the damage was not disastrous, while the boat's main gun and torpedoes were unaffected. He clearly thought Fraser's orders were premature and searched the Oswald to ensure that all the crew had escaped. He was unable to persuade one rating, who could not swim, to let go of a rail; he and three others were lost, but 52 men survived. Discipline broke down as they waited to be rescued by the enemy. </p> <p>At the obligatory court of inquiry into the loss of the submarine after the war, and the subsequent court-martial of the captain and the first lieutenant, the former was severely reprimanded and the latter dismissed the service for \"conduct unbecoming\". Kyrle Pope, on the other hand, was highly praised for his conduct in saving many lives.</p> <p>However, the scuttling was the end of his submarine service. He was first imprisoned on an island near Venice. His career as a would-be escaper began almost at once, when he and three colleagues hid for days under the eaves of the Italian officers' mess before emerging one night to steal a boat. But they were caught in the act and sent to another camp, far from the sea, at Sulmona in Abruzzi. Kyrle Pope now turned his hand to tunnelling, but was caught again. His next escape attempt took place in January 1941, when he and two airmen climbed over a fence. After five days, they were detected and put in solitary confinement for a month.</p> <p>Back at Sulmona, the irrepressible Kyrle Pope tried digging another tunnel, only to be betrayed by a donkey which fell into it. Eventually, he was transferred to the medieval fortress of Gavi, described as the \"Italian Colditz\", a special camp for habitual escapers north of Genoa. He and a few South African miners tunnelled through the thick stone walls, only to be caught when they broke through.</p> <p>Following the Italian surrender in 1943, Kyrle Pope was transferred to a camp for naval officers in north Germany. He was involved in an escape immortalised in the 1953 film Albert RN, where a dummy in naval uniform supported by two prisoners turned out on parade to cover for an escaper. In the chaos at the end of the war, he seized a German staff car and headed south-west. He managed to get to Ostend, and from there back to England. He was made an MBE, a rare award, as usually only successful escapers were decorated.</p> <p>After the war he served briefly on the Vanguard, Britain's last battleship, and spent two years in Washington as a commander with the British naval mission. In 1955, after a senior staff course, he was posted to West Germany as a naval intelligence co-ordinator. Advancing to captain in 1958, he went to the far east as naval intelligence chief at a time of political turbulence in such places as Iraq, Malaya and Indonesia. Four years later he was appointed senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf, based in Bahrain.</p> <p>In 1965 he became head of the naval branch of combined services intelligence. In 1967 he was promoted to rear-admiral and appointed chief of staff to the C-in-C, Far East, retiring from the service in 1970 with a CB. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Bahrain as general manager of the Middle East Navigation Aids Service, responsible for lighthouses, radio beacons and other safety measures for shipping in the Gulf. On retirement in 1977, he worked for the Church of England at St Albans Abbey, and elsewhere as an administrator. He is survived by his second wife, Suzanne, whom he married in 1947, their son and daughter and a stepdaughter. </p> <p>\u2022 Michael Donald Kyrle Pope, naval officer, born October 1 1916; died September 14 2008</p>",
  "<p>\"I'll probably never have to pay back my student loan - I can't imagine reaching the \u00a315k salary threshold,\" says Asiya Mahmoud, who graduated from Warwick University this year, laughing. Far from being unemployed, Asiya is working full-time for an independent television company - but without a wage.</p> <p>A Ucas guide to higher education, distributed in schools, says that, \"for both [employers and students], work experience supports the 'try before you buy' idea\". On paper, this is mutually beneficial. But as unpaid internships replace traditional entry-level jobs, they risk becoming a barrier rather than an opening for those who can't afford to work for free indefinitely.</p> <p>This trend is particularly evident in highly competitive professions such as politics, the media, publishing, think-tanks or the arts, which require a good quality degree but have no formal graduate intake process. Companies use work experience to tackle the logistical difficulties of sifting through hundreds of equally qualified applicants. It has become impossible to enter certain careers without the CV points and contacts gained through long bouts of working for free. It's logical, but presents serious problems.</p> <p>\"Placements are largely based in London, so you have to survive in the most expensive place in the world, and cope with the insecurity of short placements which are poorly paid or not at all,\" says Lee Elliot Major, research director of the Sutton Trust. \"It's certainly not direct discrimination, but the system works to deter people without family in the south-east, or who aren't rich and connected.\"</p> <p>A recent Sutton Trust report showed that 69% of people believe that parental income plays too big a part in determining children's chances. It is frustrating, to say the least, for those who have benefited from the widening of access to higher education to find doors closed to them simply because of their parents' finances.</p> <p>\"I feel like I've been lied to for the last 10 years,\" says Matthew Jones, a 22-year-old Cambridge graduate. \"You're told to work hard at school, get the GCSEs, get the A-levels, go to the best university, and you can do anything. It's not true\". Jones has an English degree, after applying to Cambridge as part of an access scheme. \"I'm really grateful for my education, and people keep telling me that I could go into banking or consultancy and get a big salary immediately. But I want to be a journalist, and I'm back in square one as my parents can't support me working for free.\"</p> <p><strong>Not a viable option</strong></p> <p>The latest figures suggest that, over a working lifetime, the average graduate will earn over \u00a3100,000 more, after tax and at today's valuation, than someone who completes their education with two or more A-levels. And graduate unemployment is only 2.5%, compared with 7.1% for those without HE level qualifications. </p> <p>While students like Jones are not destined for unemployment or low salaries, to break into certain professions is simply not a viable, or affordable, option. Another Sutton Trust report suggests that 54% of leading journalists, 42% of front-bench politicians, and 70% of barristers were privately educated. </p> <p>It concludes that, generally, the privately educated have the financial support to cope with \"low pay and insecurity at junior levels; the high costs of living in London; the increasing costs of postgraduate courses - amid a largely informal but highly competitive recruitment process\": requirements that have become the norm. It's a complex issue, as the benefits of work experience are undeniable. Rachel Wood-Harper of the National Council for Work Experience stresses this: \"Graduates learn great employability skills and, from a good quality placement, have a real chance of gaining employment.\" </p> <p><strong>Minimum wage</strong></p> <p>A basic problem arises when boundaries blur between short work placements, to give students a sense of a profession and a chance to prove themselves, and jobs that should be paid. \"We encourage employers to pay at least the minimum wage, particularly if students are employed to carry out projects and work that the company would otherwise have to employ someone to do,\" says Wood-Harper. </p> <p>The unpaid intern typically performs basic administrative tasks, as well as some more high-powered jobs such as research, writing or project-work. It can be invaluable experience, but if work placements take the place of paid, entry-level jobs or traineeships, a separation of opportunity on the basis of family wealth is inevitable. Generally speaking, to be considered for a \"real\" job in journalism or politics, broadcasting or public relations, you must have done your time working for free. \"Employers increasingly want new recruits to be able to add value straightaway,\" states the Prospects career guide. \"If you can demonstrate that you have already achieved a certain level of competence, you will be far more likely to get the job you want.\"</p> <p>Unpaid work experience, then, is frequently the only entry-level position available. The Association of Graduate Recruiters' Summer Survey 2008 shows that many sectors do pay long-term interns. However, in the competitive worlds of politics and the media, utilising the hundreds of able students willing to work long hours unpaid is a cost-effective way to get things done and to recruit new employees. This is great for the lucky few, but not for their equally talented counterparts living outside London.</p> <p>Elizabeth Timson, 22, is from Cumbria and studied PPE at Oxford. She wants to work in politics, but after graduating last year she worked in unskilled jobs to finance moving to London. She has relocated, but the constraints of paying rent mean that she still has not completed the expected placements with MPs.</p> <p>\"I'm able, hardworking and qualified, but it means nothing if I can't effectively pay to get experience. Especially in politics, you'd expect a commitment to creating opportunities so that the best, not just the fortunate, are recruited. </p> <p>\"It's really frustrating that it's so openly acknowledged that it works like this - the attitude seems to be to just shrug and say: 'Well that's the way it is.' </p> <p>\"I've not come across any attempts to make it easier. Until there is a switch of priorities, from free staff to quality staff, I'll struggle to get anywhere, simply because I didn't grow up in the right place or with rich enough parents.\"</p> <p><strong>Tip of the iceberg</strong></p> <p>While the Sutton Trust insists that it would be simple for companies to introduce targeted schemes to give the same opportunities to those outside London, very few have done so. Assistance offered by charities such as the Social Mobility Fund, and several universities, including Leeds and Hull, prove that it can work, but touch only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Legislative control of internships - such as the imposition of a minimum wage, a maximum period for unpaid work or guidelines on what it is and isn't acceptable to expect from an unpaid intern - is problematic because of the huge differences between industries and individual companies. </p> <p>\"Regulation risks drying up the supply of work experience,\" says David Willetts, shadow secretary for innovation, universities and skills. \"The whole point of the internship system is that it's informal, so it's difficult to broaden access without institutional reform or charitable assistance. I'm very much in favour of apprenticeships as an alternative.\"</p> <p>In August, students with confirmed university places reached record numbers, up 9.1% on last year. However, a 2007 Guardian/ICM survey showed that 89% of people believed they were still judged by their class. Greater access to higher education cannot be translated into true social mobility while those from less privileged backgrounds are denied access to many positions of prestige or influence, or until, as Elliot Major says, we \"judge not by where people are from, but by what they have to offer\".</p>",
  "<p>Economic recession and depression can lead to exclusion and, at worst, persecution of the most vulnerable groups within society.

  "<p><strong>Heather Scott</strong><br>Deputy head, Leeds </p> <p>No. I can empathise with those people who are so keen for their child to attend a particular school because they've heard good things about it, read the Ofsted report, or their child's friends are going there. But there is a system in place that does endeavour to make it as fair as possible for everyone to access high-quality education in the state sector. It wouldn't be something I could do myself or would advocate for anyone else to do. And I would feel I had a duty of care if I found out that anyone in my school was doing it. Though what do you do? Tell the authorities, peel a child away from their school? Local authorities have a system to ferret this out. You do hear of it, but I've never taught in a school where I've known it to happen. </p> <p><strong>Soozie Moulson </strong><br>Parent, east Yorkshire</p> <p>I wouldn't dare do it, but if you have the brass neck, then do it! Where I live, if people could change their postcode, it's the one thing they'd do. I am sympathetic to parents who want their children to get to good schools, and I would never tell on them. The school I wanted for my son was in the city centre. The whole city applies, but once you've done your entry test, you do a test on how far you live from your feeder school. Our feeder school was less than quarter of a mile away, but those who lived maybe two miles away took precedence. It was the oddest system. I appealed, but we were unsuccessful. I cried buckets.</p> <p><strong>Richard Serunjogi </strong><br>Aged 16, London</p> <p>If it's not breaking the law, I might consider it. I don't think it's entirely fair making your school depend on where you live - that will exclude a lot of worthy candidates - but it's necessary to have a cap or a limit or you'll get too many applicants at the best schools, and people need to get to school without having to travel too far. Now I'm on the receiving end of the best sixth-form education available, I can definitely sympathise with parents who resort to this. Giving your child the best start in life is on all parents' minds. I don't think everything can be completely level in the state sector; the grammar schools will always do best academically because they can filter and select, but every school can be a good school. Lots of people move house to areas where the schools are better.</p>",
  "<p>If you ever needed to show a visitor a typical pub you couldn't go far wrong with the Punch and Judy. Nestled between low houses on a back street in Tonbridge, Kent, its exposed wood beams, dark wooden floors, brass rails at the bar, desultory couples at tables with their half pints and Sunday papers, are a very British kind of ideal. Most in the room recognise, or know each other; some have been coming here for nearly 20 years. </p> <p>The coffin in the front room would be unusual, though. Colm Powell, 44, the publican, has just ended a 10-day hunger strike, during which he slept in the coffin every night in a rococo but heartfelt protest against rising rents, beer prices, and fines imposed by the pub company, Enterprise Inns, that owns the pub. Last Friday he was served with an eviction notice, and at 11am on November 11, he will lose the business he has run for 17 years, and with it his social life and his home, because he lives above it. On November 1 he intends to go on hunger strike again. Out the back, in the garden/smokers' area, where his grapes have ripened dark and juicy and a tomato plant defies the coming autumn, he is subdued and quietly spoken, but determined. \"When they come to take me they'll have to physically take me out in the box.\"</p> <p>Coffin aside, he is part of an epidemic. According to the most recent figures from the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), 36 pubs are closing a week - five a day. In 2004, it was eight a week; two a week in 2005, and six a week in 2006. Kate Nicholls of the Association of Licensed </p> <p>Multiple Retailers (ALMR, which represents anyone operating 50 or fewer bars or pubs), emphasises that these are net closures, so this is partly due to a sudden drop in numbers of openings. \"In 2007 just over 1,000 new pubs opened, consistent since 2004. This year to date we've had 403 and I can't see it improving significantly by the end of the year.\" In the early 2000s, according to the ALMR, pubs were a major source of employment, accounting for one in five of all new jobs; the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) estimates that closures have cost 44,000 jobs over the past five years, and 43,000 are projected to be lost over the next five. There have been 37 major brewery closures, accounting for 25% of all brewery employees. In 2008 alone, 13 pub operators, operating 960 pubs, have gone into administration. </p> <p>Some of this is simple credit-crunch economics. Richard Thomas, 48, who was evicted from The Plough, in Three Bridges, Crawley, in January, after 20 years in the pub business, says he wishes he'd gone to the bookies three years ago and bet that there was a recession on the way. \"You can tell by what people are buying. You sell less premium lagers, you'll sell more cask ales.\" Rising utility bills have hit pubs particularly hard, at all links in the chain. Powell's have gone up by 35%, meaning he's been paying \u00a3350 a month just to stay afloat. Rising prices of oil, barley, aluminium (for kegs) and natural gas affect the brewers. But, as Thomas points out, you can only increase your prices to reflect the cost of beer. \"People don't want to see you putting on an extra 40% because of electricity.\" </p> <p>But the credit crunch is just another nudge towards the edge for a business that has changed dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years. Not long ago a woman came into the Punch and Judy who remembered it when she was a child and her grandfather ran it. It was called the Gardener's Arms then, and Powell has photographs of the silvered publican, in handlebar moustache, posing proudly behind the bar. They had agricultural shows there and Christmas dinners; \"it was like someone's living room.\" </p> <p>It was this feeling that a pub sits at the centre of community life that Powell has aspired to. He stages live folk music every week and a poetry evening every two weeks. The pub hosts fancy dress parties and meetings of the Tonbridge Independent Traders Society (or \"TITS\", as regular Ray Everett, 69, points out, with glee). Being from Dublin, Powell makes a particular effort on St Patrick's Day, bringing in turf and getting bands in every night. He has wakes for regulars who die. In two hours the only times he smiles are when I ask what he'd do if he could set up a microbrewery, and about the good times. \"I've got so many good memories. So many.\" Everett has been coming to the Punch and Judy for 20 years. \"I want to drink here because most of us know each other. Even if you come on your own there's someone to talk to.\"</p> <p>Roger Protz, editor of the Good Beer guide, traces the change to a 1989 report to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which recommended that the big six breweries, which owned 45,000 pubs between them, could keep only 2,000 pubs each. There are now only 10,000 brewery-owned pubs. In their place came pub companies which did no brewing at all, and were often owned by banks. And \"once you start owning real estate you want to maximise income\". The original idea was for more competition, but it didn't take long before the pubcos were consolidating too - now the two biggest companies, Punch and Enterprise, own about 7,500 and 8,000 pubs respectively. Admiral, the next down, has just under 3,000. </p> <p>Pubcos lease pubs to publicans, and often operate a tie system, whereby they are only allowed to use beers provided by the pubco. \"They set publicans quotas,\" says Protz. \"you've got to sell x barrels of beer of week and if you don't meet the quota you'll be in trouble. And they give them no discounts on beer. One of the founders of Punch once told me, 'We buy beer cheap'\" - from the big four breweries, Scottish and Newcastle (now owned by Heineken); Coors; Carlsberg; and Inbev (better known as Stella Artois) - \"'and sell it dear, and that's our profit.'\" There isn't much space, in this model, for a publican to make money. \"They've also brought in very, very high rents for pubs\"; Protz worries, in fact, that some pubcos can be run in a \"in a very hard, ruthless fashion.\" </p> <p>Powell says his troubles began when he allowed a company called Bruline to install a monitoring system that allowed Enterprise to track what kind of beer was going through his pipes - he thought he it might be useful when it came to keeping a tally of what he was selling. But he says that the company would not give him access to the figures, and then, one day, a man from Bruline demanded to know why there were five cases of an untied beer in the cellars of two other pubs Powell also ran. Powell says he doesn't know what those cases were doing there and was outraged that his cellars had been rooted through without his permission. So he disconnected the power supply to the system and ordered the representative out. Bruline removed the system a week later. Within weeks Enterprise informed him that his rent had increased from \u00a336,000 to \u00a344,000 a year. Shortly afterwards, he says, Enterprise let a larger pub round the corner for \u00a320,000, which began to siphon off his custom. He dropped further and further into the red. As he became unable to pay for beer, he says that Enterprise stopped giving him credit and so he started paying upfront, but didn't always receive a full order. In desperation, he says, he began to buy beer from the cash and carry, which was about \u00a340 cheaper, per keg; Enterprise fined him \u00a3180 for every barrel bought outside the tie. About a year ago, Powell suffered a breakdown. </p> <p>According to Enterprise, it \"sought to help Mr Powell, with deferred payment terms, special discounts, a late licence application and a permanent rent reduction. Despite this help Mr Powell continued to breach the terms of his agreements, eventually leaving us with no alternative but to seek possession of the pubs involved. We continue to offer assistance to retailers who are experiencing difficulties in challenging trading conditions. However we have a reasonable expectation that our retailers will make efforts to meet their side of agreements and must act when they do not.\" Powell insists he doesn't recognise this version of events, and claims he received no help.</p> <p>He remembers the days when he answered to Whitbread with nostalgia. \"Breweries would keep rents very low,\" says Protz, \"not even economic, sometimes, on the logic that they could make lots of return on selling lots of beer and food and wine. That is no longer the case.\" Running a pub was never going to make anyone very rich, but it could provide a tidy, sociable living. Until about five years ago, says Powell, \"I had a nice car, and nice holidays. I haven't had a holiday in four years.\"</p> <p>During the 1990s various European commissions looked into whether these restrictive agreements were anti-competitive; in 2004 there was a select committee inquiry into the practices of pubcos ; all, says Protz drily, \"found that there was a perfectly good free market operating - and you just wonder which planet the MPs are coming from\". In 2004 recommendations were made for voluntary practices and codes; these are currently being examined by the business and enterprise select committee.</p> <p>It is interesting that, according to the AMLR, it's not the big high-street chains who are suffering most but what are called, in the trade, \"community locals\" - small pubs in suburban and rural areas (already hit by clampdowns on drink-driving and the lack of public transport) without high profit margins, and particularly those run by pubcos, which account for half of net closures. The BBPA, which represents them, disagrees, though more as a point of emphasis than fact. \"More than 50% [of pubs closing] are in the free trade, the model the complainants seem to think would be their saviour. If you look at the major pubcos only 13% [of pubs closing] are owned by them. I think that shows quite clearly that the leased and tenanted model is far more robust at helping pubs through difficult times. It's not in a company's interest to put pubs out of business.\"</p> <p>The BBPA prefers to blame the government for most of its ills, and it is true that the pub business seems quite thoroughly regulated. According to the ALMR, regulatory burdens - everything from noise control to waste packaging regulations - cost \u00a330,000 per outlet per year. Everyone is particularly outraged by this year's budget, which imposed a 6% increase in beer tax, and operates on a duty escalator, meaning 2% above-inflation increases year on year for the next four years.</p> <p>Then, of course, there's the smoking ban. It is true that the effect has been uneven. For example, at the Royal Inn on the Park, a large airy pub looking out on the trees and wrought iron gates of Victoria Park, east London, the smoking ban \"may in fact have helped more than hindered,\" says Jon Smart, 37, who has run it for the last three years, and seen takings rise. It has a lot of outside space, and he has deliberately gone for the family market - parents, children, women coming in at lunchtime. Down the road at the Palm Tree, a fantastically cosy and welcoming East End boozer that has been run by the same family, the Barretts, for 32 years, it has made no difference at all. </p> <p>But the BBPA estimated, at the time the ban was introduced, that 3,000 pubs would close as a result, and has now revised that figure up to between 5,000 and 6,000. In a briefing document for the government, it claims that the industry as a whole has now spent \u00a3100m building outdoor areas to accommodate smokers; some smaller, more independent pubs can't afford to do this, while \"landlocked\" pubs - those with no outside space - have been particularly damaged. \"I think the government mishandled that badly,\" says Protz. \"They should have given the pubs five years, and the discretion of setting aside a room for smokers.\" Combined with the fast-rising cost of beer, the effect can be disastrous. \"Why spend \u00a34 a pint and smoke outdoors when you can go to Sainsbury's or Asda and smoke in the comfort of your own home?\" asks Nicholls. \"That's what's decimated the trade over the last two years.\"</p> <p>And therein lies one of the biggest problems of all - the cost of supermarket alcohol. On October 10, Tory MP Nigel Evans, having discovered that Asda had been selling four-packs of Skol for 90p, nearly half the price of a four-pack of Evian, tabled an early day motion demanding that the government look at pricing policy. Increasingly publicans have found that people strapped for cash will do most of their drinking before they go out. Or they will bring it with them. Going in to the women's toilets to clear up at the end of a Saturday night, Powell will often find small vodka and Bacardi bottles; all these customers are buying is a dash of Coke, or a glass of cranberry juice. This is the vast blind spot in all the hand-wringing about binge drinking: cheap alcohol, readily available, with no oversight of its consumption. Publicans argue that a community pub is the best place to learn responsible drinking. \"Kids come in here because their parents used to,\" says Powell. \"And they know at the end of the night when I say they've had enough they'll go home. You don't get that at Wetherspoon's.\" </p> <p>It's not all about crying into pints, however. In the parlance of the trade, \"food-led\" establishments are doing better than \"wet-led\" ones. \"That's undoubtedly in response to the smoking ban, making a virtue out of necessity,\" says Nicholls. Since 2004, there has been an 18% increase in food-led pubs such as the Crown, a gastropub that opened six months ago, a stone's throw from the Royal Inn on the Park, all leather sofas and pastel colours, designer lamps and posters of people skiing. It's doing fine so far, but the manager, Tanya Stafford, 40, isn't sure what will happen when its out of the honeymoon period, and is not allowed to talk about it, referring me to a PR company. The nearby Empress of India went too far in the food direction, intimidating people by looking like a restaurant; it's done better since, adding a seating area with deep sofas, just for drinking. \"People talk about the cafe society,\" says Nicholls, \"about how it doesn't seem to be developing; actually, cafe bars are up 47%, and account for 43% of all new openings this year.\" Though everyone's having to be clever about their costs at the moment: the Crown uses limes when lemons get too dear; the Empress, instead of buying separate cuts of meat, recently bought a whole cow and butchered it themselves. At the other end of the scale, where bottles of Bollinger aren't necessarily lined up behind the bar, and the clientele can't afford to eat out much, Julie Barnard, of the Swan Inn in North Petherton, Somerset, allows punters to bring in their own food. </p> <p>The widespread loss of rural pubs, and the attendant loss of a community, is something that Prince Charles has been worrying about for years. In 2001 he established the Pub is the Hub initiative, which advises pubs on how to diversify. All over the country, there are now 350 village pubs that are also shops, or post offices, or cook school meals, or provide IT training. Quite often villagers have responded by taking over their own locals - the Jolly Farmer in Cookham Dean, Berkshire, is part-run by the villagers, as is the Walnut Tree, in nearby Fawley, the Unicorn in Peppard, near Henley-on-Thames and the Bear in North Moreton, Oxfordshire. </p> <p>There are also, of course, the pubs that are thriving because they're ideally situated, or cater to specific tastes - in 2007, the Society of Independent Brewers reported an average increase in sales of 11% at the same time as Stella Artois's sales dropped by 10% - or do what they do very well. The Palm Tree, with its heirloom gold-leaf wallpaper, its faded curtain round the bar, its sense of a destination for whole generations of neighbours, its entertaingly raucous jazz nights, is a happy place to walk into, and seemingly a happy place to work in. \"It feels like Christmas every day, to me,\" as Kerry Barrett puts it, shyly. Her mother Valerie is sanguine about a possible downturn. \"You make it through the change, hopefully.\" </p> <p>As for Powell, he's vowing to keep fighting for all the publicans too cowed or bankrupt or tired to do it themselves. On November 11 he will open at 8.30am so his friends can congregate to see him off. He has hired a horse-drawn hearse to take him to his second pub, the Ivy House, a 500-year-old listed building, so he can be formally evicted at 11.30. He has a website, which will be encouraging Enterprise landlords with similar stories to write in - then he will take his coffin, tied atop a Winnebago, to each one, if they're willing, to get them some local press. \"I'm going to go all over the country, to everyone who has problems. I won't give up.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Lost your local? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/21/pub-closures-britain\">Share information</a> on pub closures near you</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday November 26 2008.

  "<p>Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal, who has died of a heart attack aged 79, was a Las Vegas legend, a pioneer who brought sports bookmaking into US casinos as a legitimate business, at least by Vegas standards, who introduced female blackjack dealers and immediately doubled business at the tables, and who was the inspiration for the \"Ace Rothstein\" character played by Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino. But his greatest achievement may have been simply surviving into old age. </p> <p>Rosenthal owed that good fortune partly to his instincts and partly to a design flaw in the 1981 Cadillac Eldorado. On October 4 1982, a bomb exploded in his car as Rosenthal left Tony Roma's Las Vegas steakhouse with a bag of spare ribs for his children. Only a metal plate placed under the driver's seat to correct the car's imbalance saved his life. He soon took his children and left Las Vegas, first for California and then to Florida, where he managed his nephew's bar and grill and, later, ran a profitable internet betting site.</p> <p>Rosenthal was born in Chicago, the spiritual home of US gangsters and sports fixers. As a teenager he was already setting odds for bookmakers, whose illegal business was controlled by the mob. He studied the business like any other, but had an innate talent for setting odds that both attracted bets and protected bookies. He was also actively involved in fixing the outcomes of sporting events, and established a reputation for ruthlessly protecting his, and his employers', interests. In 1961, called to testify before a congressional committee, he invoked his fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination 38 times - including when asked if he was left-handed, thus earning his nickname.</p> <p>The following year he was convicted in North Carolina of trying to bribe college basketball players to \"shave\" points, and win by less than the bookie's published spread. He moved to Las Vegas in 1968, after being implicated in bombings during the infamous Miami \"bookie wars\". He soon married a topless showgirl, Geri McGee (later played by Sharon Stone in Casino), and brought his childhood friend Anthony \"Tony the Ant\" Spilotro to Vegas, as his enforcer. The city's murder rate allegedly went up 70% after Spilotro's arrival. His nickname referred to his stature, which is why Joe Pesci was cast in his role, renamed \"Nicky Santoro\", in the Casino film. </p> <p>In 1974, reportedly as a result of his wife's nagging, Rosenthal took a job as floor manager at the Stardust hotel, and soon had an executive position with the company, reputedly a mob front, that owned that casino and three others. He presented a television talk show sponsored by the Stardust; his first guest was, perhaps not surprisingly, Frank Sinatra. In reality he was running all four casinos, but without a licence, and in 1976 the Nevada state gaming commission deemed him unsuitable. Although he won an appeal to a friendly judge, the battle continued until finally, in 1988, he was placed in the \"black book\" which bars gamblers from casinos. Meanwhile, he fell out with Spilotro, who had begun an affair with McGee, and whose role in skimming large amounts of untraceable casino cash from the mob's own skim had been revealed. Spilotro was also engineering jewellery heists from casino hotels, further irritating the city's powers-that-be. </p> <p>The question of who tried to blow up Rosenthal remains unanswered. Rosenthal claimed it was due to his association with Spilotro - \"once they discovered we were childhood friends there was no way to overcome it\" - but his own role in the skim might be a better reason. Or Spilotro himself might have felt his former pal had sold him out. A month later, McGee was found dead in a Los Angeles motel, of an overdose of alcohol and drugs. Soon afterwards, Rosenthal left Las Vegas for good.</p> <p>When Casino appeared, Rosenthal was quoted as saying, \"I'm not Bob [De Niro] and he's not Frank,\" but in a 2007 interview he conceded that the film was \"almost totally accurate ... I raped the strip's casinos.\" Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the film and its book, said, \"When Lefty went, the new Las Vegas emerged, the corporate Vegas.\" Indeed, in today's Las Vegas, the mayor, Oscar Goodman, was once Rosenthal's attorney. \"I don't believe he ever spent a day in jail when I represented him,\" he said. \"Law enforcement ... probably didn't care for him but he treated me well and paid his bills on time.\" </p> <p>Goodman may have understated the case. One former federal prosecutor told a Las Vegas paper that \"you should never speak ill of the dead, but Lefty Rosenthal is one of the exceptions. He was an awful human being.\" </p> <p>He is survived by Steven and Stephanie, the children of his marriage to McGee. </p> <p>\u2022 Frank Lawrence 'Lefty' Rosenthal, gambler and gangster, born June 12 1929; died October 13 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 25 2008. When Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal said: \"I'm not Bob and he's not Frank,\" he was talking about himself and Robert De Niro, who played him in the film Casino. He was not, as we suggested in the article above, referring to Frank Sinatra. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Soon, Daughter will be off again, touring the far east for six whole months. She's forever doing it - whizzing off, looking for the sun. It started with the gap year, and never stopped. But before she goes this time, she's moving in with me for three weeks. She is not thrilled. She must leave her own darling, spick-and-span, exquisitely decorated flat and live here in the witch's hovel, where the decor is comparatively grunty. I don't care about decor, because I can't really do it. It means constant arranging, designing, choosing, moving bits around and shopping.</p> <p>Only last week we had a tiny but vicious row in Poundstretcher. We needed boxes, so that I could decant my clothing from upstairs and store it in the downstairs cloakroom (aka lavatory) so that Daughter can fit hers in upstairs. That's all we needed. Boxes. But when we got there she spotted some adorable bargain lamps. She had to have them. But which ones? This one or that one? Two of these? Or one each of these and those? Or those?</p> <p>I didn't care. They were all lampshades to me, and I wanted to get home. But if I stood glaring and fidgeting then naturally Daughter could not relax and choose. I was stressing her out. She was wasting my day. Clash of the titans. Soon we were screeching at each other at the checkout. And she hadn't even moved in yet. </p> <p>And what about my routine? My dull food, early nights, heating and lights off, creeping around with my furry, leopard-pattern hot-water bottle, Purcell playing softly and poignantly in the background, regular EastEnders and dogs on the sofa. Daughter prefers light, heat, noise, chat, fancy cooking, glamour and dogs on the floor. Will we make it? We're both desperate not to fall out before the departure. We absolutely must both be in a sunny mood in the final moments, and not part in a sulk.</p> <p>Which will be difficult because I don't really want her to go. I don't even like her crossing the road, never mind oceans. I know she's a grown up, but this is the trouble with children. Watch out you people with younger ones who think that once they grow up, leave school, leave home, you'll be able to relax. No you won't. Because the bigger they get, the bigger the problems: the partners, relationships, grandchildren, jobs, houses, bills, illnesses and divorces. It never, ever ends. </p> <p>Now, too late, I understand my own mother's overwhelming, intrusive, smothering, overprotective anxiety, terror and nagging. She knew the hairstyle and boyfriends were wrong, but what could she do? Nothing, because once your child is an adult, it's none of your business. You must just sit at the ringside biting on a flannel and hoping for the best. So I just have to wait here for six months, sweating it out and praying for an email to prove that's she's still alive and well. And hoping that she'll be back to stay for another three weeks in the spring.</p> <p>\u2022 It is important, in a general election, to attract women voters, because there are lots of us. David Cameron has realised this. Marvellous. Let's vote for him. But he doesn't know how to attract us, so he's hired married mothers (they would be, wouldn't they?) Jane Cunningham and Philippa Roberts, who run the consultancy Pretty Little Head, to help him. But wait a minute. Let's not vote for him if he doesn't know what women want without instruction from these two. He's got a wife. He lives with a live woman. Why doesn't he ask her? I bet she could tell him what scores of researchers have been trying to tell him for decades: that women are empathetic rather than competitive. We are altruistic, and we want, as PLH says, \"to make the world a more attractive place\". </p> <p>Personally, I think all consultants should be shot at dawn. And anyone in a top job who needs their advice on how to do the job ought not to be in it. If Cameron is a grown-up who wishes to lead the country, he should know all about women by now. I could tell him for nothing. We are like humans. We can do most things. Just look, David, if you don't believe me, at PLH's blurb. \"Brand Culture as a concept reflects the organic, expansive nature of the powerful female brand, in contrast with the reductionist, linear construct of the male brand,\" they say. Which just goes to show that they can write bollocks like any man. \"Gender differences impacts [sic] on the types of creative ideas,\" says PLH. See? Girls can get their grammar wrong, just like boys.</p> <p>I often bang on about the way in which older people are treated like alien beings. This is the same, but with women. It is 2008 and the leader of the opposition still needs help in working out how our \"little\" minds work. PLH has apparently advised him that he should lay off tax cuts and Europe, and stress women's issues: schools, health and crime. Nothing too grand or international. Just little local topics that relate to our kiddies, our bodies and our streets. If David's party concentrates on those, women will flock to the polls and vote him in, as opposed to Gordon Brown, who Cameron seems to think is not attractive to women. Well think again, Cameron. Perhaps it's time we had a more serious, hardworking fellow in charge. We've had one slime-ball pin-up for prime minister, perhaps our pretty little heads are telling us that we don't want another one.</p> <p>\u2022 This week Michele saw <strong>Welcome to Ramallah</strong>, by Sonja Linden and Adah Kay: \"An affecting summary of the horrors of the Palestinian experience.\" She read <strong>The Really Useful Grandparents Book</strong>, by Eleo Gordon and Tony Lacey: \"Which I fancy because of its huge selection of pastimes that I might be too knackered to think of, from bird cakes to the history of Russia.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cricket has never seen anything like it so it's enough to get anyone's head spinning,\" Matt Prior admits as he and his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandcricketteam\">England</a> team-mates prepare for the inaugural Stanford Series of Twenty20 matches which culminates in a winner-takes-all $20m (\u00a311.7m) showdown in Antigua against West Indies a week on Saturday. After playing Middlesex this weekend and Trinidad &amp; Tobago next Tuesday, England will face Allen Stanford's West Indian \"Superstars\" in three hours of moneyed mayhem on November 1 - a date which could change cricket forever.</p> <p>\"You get the feeling cricket will never be quite the same again,\" Prior says with unexpected thoughtfulness for a cricketer who has been lampooned for his supposedly boorish chattering. \"We have to be careful about the way the game goes because Test cricket is still the ultimate form where most players want to make their biggest mark. If we were playing the West Indies in a Test we could be more confident. But in Twenty20 one guy can change the whole match in a few overs. So it's a 50-50 call. One team will scoop the lot and the other will walk off empty-handed. That's why people who aren't interested in cricket might watch this game.\"</p> <p>Prior lets slip a dark little laugh when asked how he might cope as a wicketkeeper, who has also been criticised for his mistakes behind the stumps, if the match is decided on the last ball and he needs to get beneath a high catch to win millions for his team? \"You'll probably see me pulling the gloves off and shouting to someone else to take the catch,\" he jokes. \"These are things you do think about because you could end up in that situation. If you mess it up you'd feel terrible but the only way not to regret it your whole life is if you've done everything possible to prepare yourself. Anyway, I prefer to think about one of us hitting a four off the last ball or making a flying catch to win the game.\"</p> <p>The fallout from a stunt of a cricket match will be difficult for both teams - as Prior acknowledges. \"How are you going to deal with winning a mind-boggling amount of money for three hours of Twenty20 cricket? How do you deal with it if you lose and get nothing? We fly to India five days later for an important tour so it's vital that, win or lose, we get our heads right. But when I first read about it I thought the figures were a misprint and they'd added on an extra zero or two by mistake. And then when I saw it was for real I thought, 'Ah well, I'm not even in the squad so I'm happy for the guys - if just a little jealous'.\"</p> <p>He laughs again, wryly this time, and it is possible to believe that Prior might accept the Stanford outcome more philosophically than most - which will surprise those who have dismissed him as a Porsche-driving, jellybean-throwing brat. \"It's been hard to read comments written by people who have never met me. They've seen this excitable young guy on telly and they've made up their minds. But I don't want to be portrayed that way. As times passes maybe people will realise there is more to me.\"</p> <p>Prior provides unexpectedly engaging and even contemplative company. In addressing his clattering rise and fall last year, in which a century on his Test debut at Lord's was followed seven months later by him being dropped unceremoniously, he suggests that he withstood far more turbulent days as a boy.</p> <p>\"My real setbacks have never been on the cricket pitch. The day me and my parents left South Africa for England is burned into my brain - 3 September 1993. Moving countries is a massive thing in itself but my parents separated soon after we arrived. It was just me and mum and she was then diagnosed with very aggressive cancer. So there I was, aged 12, and my life had been turned upside. It was really tough and cricket became my escape.</p> <p>\"I'm lucky my mum, Terri, is so strong. She had the operation and then chemo and radiation and it went on and on. I can't say exactly how long because I've tried to block it out of my memory. You're always waiting for the cancer to return and, even though she really protected me, you can tell when your mum is not doing so well. In the end she beat it and she's well again.\" </p> <p>Prior sounds positively Nietzschean as he reaches into his limited knowledge of the German philosopher to paraphrase \"that saying which tells us that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I've always thought those are such harsh words but they're also true. Now I'm trying to add a little more wisdom because I made some mistakes with England but the important thing is to learn from them.\"</p> <p>The 26 year-old stresses that certain aspects of his reputation are largely unfounded. He claims to have been an innocent bystander in one of the more notoriously juvenile sagas which tarnished his name - when jellybeans were littered across the pitch as England tried, without any wit, to unsettle India. \"I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and had nothing to do with the jellybean incident. Unfortunately I got collared for it but, again, it's something that's made me stronger and hopefully wiser.</p> <p>\"Then there was the ludicrous suggestion that I was trying to sledge Sachin Tendulkar by telling him I drive a Porsche. I remember reading that and thinking, 'What is going on?' I'd been having some silly banter with Alastair Cook and it got picked up by the stump mic and everyone assumed it was directed at Tendulkar. It was just me being a little too excitable.\"</p> <p>Prior also defends his controversial wicketkeeping which, despite a Test average of 40 with the bat after 10 Tests, cost him his place after last year's tour of Sri Lanka. \"Everyone said I kept terribly. But after five and a half weeks Kumar Sangakkara [the Sri Lankan batsman and former keeper] said to me, 'You've done brilliantly because Sri Lanka is the hardest place in the world to keep wicket'. That was a massive compliment. In Colombo it was 50 degrees and we were in the field for 197 overs after I'd batted from the previous afternoon and was last man out for 79. I still only conceded one bye.</p> <p>\"But then we went to Galle and, I'll be honest, by the time we got to the 90th over I was shattered and I'd dropped [Mahela] Jayawardene. I'll never forget it. I took a clearcut catch down the legside, one of my best-ever catches, and it wasn't given. I then put down a chance from Jayawardene and I hold my hands up: it was my fault. He started smashing it all over the place on his way to a double century and I got the axe.\" If Prior considered reverting to a specialist batting role he was encouraged by the national coach, Peter Moores, that \"there was no need to go back to the drawing board. Peter said I was not doing a lot wrong. I took that as a real positive and resolved to improve myself both on and off the field.\"</p> <p>Prior points to his ambassadorial work for Thomas Eggar, the solicitors who are about to launch a sports law division, as part of his quest to become a more rounded cricketer. \"Sports law is increasingly important when you consider the money on offer to professional sportsmen these days. My time away from England, after I was dropped, gave me a chance to do some new things and turn a major disappointment into a big turning point.\"</p> <p>It says much for Prior's essentially generous spirit that, out of the public gaze, he was one of the first to text congratulations to Tim Ambrose when his wicketkeeping rival scored a Test century in New Zealand. Yet, having overcome Ambrose's challenge at Sussex a few years before, he was bolstered in his belief that he could win back his England place. The first half of that objective was realised in August when Prior was recalled to the one-day team. His return coincided with the rise of Kevin Pietersen as England captain.</p> <p>\"KP has been brilliant. I was amazed after the Trent Bridge one-dayer [when Prior took six catches] that he texted me. He said, 'Mate, fantastic, I'm really proud of you. You did very well'. It meant the world to me and I really enjoy his attitude to the game. Kevin wants us to get our skills up to the best in the world so that we turn up on the day with no excuses. It's that kind of assassin's temperament he talks about - perform, win, go home. That's what we're aiming for and I hope to show I've got the temperament and the skills to do it for England whether we're playing in a really tight Test match - or in a mad three hours for 20 million.\"</p> <p>Matt Prior will help launch Thomas Eggar's new sports law division in London tomorrow</p>",
  "<p>This isn't a blog about the theme tunes, as everyone has their favourite (season 4, since you ask) and everyone seems to hate season 2, despite the fact that it's by Tom Waits, the man who wrote the thing in the first place. </p> <p>And it's also not about the montage outs at the end of each series \u2013 though the use of 'I Walk On Gilded Splinters' (unfortunately the Weller version, not the swampy Dr. John original) at the end of series four was a fantastic synergy of music programmer and editor's art. </p> <p>No, this is about the music you hear throughout each episode. The term is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis#Film_sound_and_music\">diegetic</a>, apparently. Your friendly neighbourhood film graduate would be able to tell you it means it's heard by the characters on the screen, at the same time as the audience watching. And classic scenes such as the wakes in Kavanagh's, where the BPD detectives chant along raucously to The Pogues, or the longshoremen wigging out to the Nighthawks' rocking 16 Tons, are rightfully up there in most Wireheads' favourite memories. There are other, more subtle moments, which convey the perfect tone, although it is not until later that you realise how it added another level to the action. </p> <p>As befits a show where the characters spend much time in cars, whether on stakeouts or rolling past their corners, some of the most iconic musical moments take place on four wheels.</p> <p>My favourite is when Bunny takes the kids to eat in the restaurant. As soon as they get in the car to go home, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ZUsnFevQo&amp;feature=related\">Namond changes the stations without asking</a>, from Billie Holiday to a full on rap channel. A middle fingered salute, hitting out at a man he feels embarrassed him in the only way he can. </p> <p>But then there's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29L_yWV-698&amp;feature=related\">the trip in Orlando's old-school Caddy, when Kima nearly dies</a> because the cops can't hear what she's saying into the wire for the bumping hip hop. Personally, I think the music in this scene is slightly wrong \u2013 Mos' Def and Talib Kweli's conscious hip hop classic Black Star album is not really the sort of thing a strip club owner in a pimpmobile might be pumping. </p> <p>Or how about the way the shimmering quiet of the afternoon West side streets after the drug dealer's ballgame is broken only by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" hhqd5e-wyse\">the beats emanating from his rolled down window as Avon glides past, making eye contact with Daniels</a> and wagging his finger at him as he throws off the tail in slow motion?</p> <p>Then there's music in the bars \u2013 like the doo-wop classic Mother in Law playing on the jukebox as McNulty, back to his boozehound, coozehound ways at the start of series five, calls Beadie to tell her he's pulling a late one, and no, he always slurs when he's tired. </p> <p>And the parties \u2013 the booty music in Orlando's, the grown-up sounds of Marvin Gaye in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bmhRFEqhFo\">the Barksdale family get together</a>, the tunes spinning at <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?feature=related&amp;v=uFYi9kh4sTs\">the party where Slim and Bodie take Cutty</a> and get him drunk, stoned and \u2013 we presume \u2013 laid to celebrate his release from prison. </p> <p>Music is woven into the fabric of The Wire like it's woven into everyday life. As a background, a soundtrack, a form of entertainment. Just another way the show is unlike almost every other programme on TV. What do you citizens think? </p> <p>Or, we could just argue about which theme tune is best?

  "<p>All of the national daily newspapers published in Turkey dedicated a special place on their front pages on Monday to the trial of people suspected of membership in Ergenekon, a criminal network with ties to the state. Headlines and titles were similar: \"Trial of the century begins,\" \"History changes today,\" \"Third confrontation with the deep state,\" \"They are called to account,\" \"Monumental trial commences,\" \"Judgment day,\" \"The Ergenekon marathon\"... The single truth advertised by these titles is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/turkey-terrorism\">the Ergenekon trial</a> is of substantial importance for Turkey.</p> <p>All Turkish media organisations, though they have diverse ideological stances, are covering this trial extensively, thereby negating the attempts by certain groups in Turkey to scorn and downplay the trial ever since the commencement of <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=132507\">the Ergenekon investigation</a>. So why is this trial so important? </p> <p>Turkey is unfortunately a country characterised by an abundance of mysterious murders, shadowy provocations that foment social, ethnic or religious hatred or conflict, terrorist organisations of all manner of ideological disposition, and bloody attacks staged by these organisations. The regime currently in place in this country is still miles away from being a system of peace based on mutual trust and respect between state and society, but gives the impression of an order of repression that seeks to ensure its survival through fabricated fears and inflated threats.</p> <p>The argument that the true democracy sought by all segments of society, one entailing greater democratic participation, extended rights and freedoms, would make the country an ungovernable one still has buyers among some influential groups. These groups that assume a self-induced responsibility and duty to maintain the survival of the existing regime believe that the only way to prevent Turkey from becoming \"an ungovernable country\" is to keep popular demands for democracy and freedoms reined in \u2013 a situation that, they argue, can only be ensured by keeping fears and concerns over security and stability alive at all times. As activities to nurture these fears and concerns cannot be undertaken openly, they need underground, shadowy terrorist organisations like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergenekon_network\">Ergenekon</a>. As such organizations have come into being for the purpose of keeping the state apparatus manageable, every organisation or act can naturally be associated with this apparatus' behind-the-scenes machinery. For this reason, the equation \"Ergenekon terrorist organisation = deep state\" is a well-justified one.</p> <p>Our argument is that \"Turkey confronts its dark past\" \u2013 and this is proposed with good reason. The 2,455-page indictment on the organisation and the millions of documents submitted with the indictment show that the Ergenekon terrorist organisation has ties with many groups within the state and the army, and that the acts directly or indirectly conducted by the organisation did indeed make their imprint on Turkey's recent past, altering the course of events and interrupting the country's natural progress. Some documents in the indictment clearly indicate that the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Hizbullah, the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBDA-C\">Islamic Great East Raiders Front</a> (IBDA-C) and many other illegal organisations or gangs either have ties with or are under the direct control of Ergenekon, some since their establishment and others from a later stage.</p> <p>Also, the claims voiced by Turkish media organizations maintain that the assassination of many distinguished journalists and intellectuals -- including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C4%9Fur_Mumcu\">Ugur Mumcu</a>, <a href=\"http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87etin_eme%C3%A7\">\u00c7etin Eme\u00e7</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Taner_Kislali\">Ahmet Taner Kislali</a>, <a href=\"http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necip_Hablemito%C4%9Flu\">Necip Hablemitoglu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/22/pressandpublishing.turkey1\">Hrant Dink</a> \u2013 and businessmen such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96zdemir_Sabanc%C4%B1\">\u00d6zdemir Sabanci</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Czeyir_Garih\">\u00dczeyir Garih</a> and many Kurdish businessmen and similar murders by unknown assailants, and the tragic killing of a Christian missionary in Malatya are linked to this organisation. Moreover, two years ago, the council of state was attacked and a judge killed; almost simultaneously, hand grenades were thrown at the office of newspaper <a href=\"http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/\">Cumhuriyet</a>. Both attacks had given the impression that they were perpetrated by radical fundamentalist groups as a reaction to a headscarf ban; it is now obvious that both were subcontracted by the Ergenekon organisation. Indeed, the chief prosecutor has recently demanded that the council of state attack case be re-heard in light of the new evidence.</p> <p>Going further back, it is suspected that this Gladio-like organization, which has existed since 1956, albeit under different names or appearances, has played an active part in many obscured murders or incidents conducted by unknown assailants. It is thought that the bloody clashes between leftist and rights groups in 1970s, the massacre in Kahramanmara\ufb02, the mass killing in \u00c7orum, the bloody May Day in Istanbul's Taksim Square in 1977, the massacre in Sivas in 1992, the mass killing in Basbaglar and the massacre in Istanbul's Gazi district in 1995 are all linked to Ergenekon.</p> <p>This shadowy network has infiltrated deep into the state bureaucracy, the media and NGOs. Since 2003, its strategy has been to create chaos in the country to prepare the grounds for an eventual military takeover. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that some retired generals who plotted two distinct, abortive military coups in 2004 against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK party) because of its policy concerning the Cyprus issue have ties to Ergenekon. Also, the fact that these generals became the chairmen of the so-called Kemalist Thought Associations (ADD) after retirement and organised a number of demonstrations called \"republican rallies\" in order to lure the military to oust the government should come as a surprise to no one. Although these generals have yet to be indicted, it is highly likely that their coup plots will be prosecuted under the process of the Ergenekon trial. </p> <p>In the end, they all served one grand purpose: to keep Turkey under the reins of the former Kemalist elites \u2013 though they are called neo-nationalists nowadays \u2013 and maintain the system of \"military guardianship\".</p> <p>Thanks to this trial, for the first time in its history, Turkey is attempting to try military officers on active duty on charges of attempting to overthrow the elected government. If it can do this successfully, Turkish democracy has a bright future. No doubt, the Turkish judicial system will undergo a serious test of its maturity with this trial; either it will show that it is pressure-proof \u2013 or that it is a failing system.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we must correctly analyze the threat posed by the PKK in its efforts to fill the gap vacated by Ergenekon \u2013 in terms of injecting fear into society so that the country becomes easily manageable by certain groups. It is possible to regard the errors that go beyond army negligence in the face of PKK attacks on military outposts in Daglica in 2007 and in Akt\u00fct\u00fcn earlier this month, where many soldiers were killed, in this context. Now, everyone must open their eyes to the fact that, whether the job of persuading society that the country is always under threat is done by Ergenekon or the PKK or any other terrorist organisation, this serves only to increase the influence of generals over politics and government.</p> <p>The Ergenekon trial is truly a turning point for Turkey. Turkey will either purge itself of this poison or be obliged to live with its toxic effects.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: a correction was made on October 21 at 11:00 at the author's request to the date of the PKK attack on the military station at Daglica; our apologies for the initial error.</em></p>",
  "<p>The US presidential election will not be free and fair, because millions of electors will either not be allowed to vote or will not have their votes properly counted. It could cost Barack Obama the White House, even if he wins most of the votes on November 4. This sensational claim is based on research by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html\">New York Times</a> (NYT) and BBC Newsnight. The NYT found that in some states for every new voter registered in the last couple of months, two voters have been removed \u2013 negating Obama's massive voter registration drive. This voter purging could mean fewer people voting next month than voted in 2004. </p> <p>In Colorado, for example, which has seen a significant population increase since the last presidential election, the state has recorded a net loss of nearly 100,000 voters from its rolls since 2004. Louisiana, Michigan and Colorado are deleting registered voters from the rolls within 90 days of a federal election, which is illegal except when voters die, notify the authorities that they have moved out of state, or have been declared unfit to vote.</p> <p>This widespread electoral malpractice is independently corroborated by a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7617204.stm\">Newsnight</a> investigation by <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com\">Greg Palast</a>. He reminds us that in the 2004 presidential election, between 1.6 and three million votes were cast but <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/23638322/block_the_vote/2\">never counted</a>, according to the US Election Assistance Commission. This is easily enough votes to have changed the outcome of the poll and put John Kerry in the White House. </p> <p>Palast says that almost three million voters have already been purged from the voter rolls \u2013 mostly poor and black voters who are more likely to vote Democrat. During elections in New Mexico earlier this year, one in nine voters found that their names had disappeared from the voter rolls. In Colorado, the disenfranchisement is even greater, with 20% of voters being purged.</p> <p>It has happened before. During the 2004 presidential election one in four registered Ohio voters turned up at the polling booth only to discover that their names were not on the voter roll, an exclusion rate of 25%. </p> <p>Democrat leaders are too high on their \"Yes we can\" hype to kick up a fuss about this massive disenfranchisement of their voters. They naively assume that Obama's poll lead will give him victory, regardless of the election bias. It might. But then, again, it might not. </p> <p>Another form of voter exclusion is happening in Michigan, where 62,000 lower income families, mostly Democrat supporters, face losing their homes to foreclosure. Loss of residence means losing their voting address and their right to vote. Many of the evictions are being orchestrated by a foreclosure company that supports the Republican party.</p> <p>Michigan isn't alone. In several crucial swing states, including Nevada and Florida, foreclosures and the consequent loss of voting rights could affect the outcome and decide the presidency. </p> <p>Election bias doesn't stop there. The Republican strategist <br><a href=\"http://www.rove.com/election\">Karl Rove</a> has <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2006/10/31/will_a_shocking_new_gop_court\">backed</a> a new law requiring voters to show photo ID at the polling booth. One in ten US citizens don't have photo ID. Among African Americans it is one in five. This requirement will disenfranchise millions of poor, elderly and black Americans, who tend to vote Democrat. In one swing state, Indiana, an estimated 100,000 African-Americans may lose their right to vote. A combination of voter roll purging and photo ID requirement could be enough to swing the presidential election in favour of John McCain \u2013 even if Barack Obama has a substantial opinion poll lead on election day. </p> <p>Writing in Rolling Stone magazine in 2006, the civil rights lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr, JFK's nephew, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen\">revealed</a> how voting irregularities in 2004 were enough to steal the presidency for the Republicans. He has also <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11717105/robert_f_kennedy_jr__will_the_next_election_be_hacked/1\">demonstrated</a> that the electronic voting machines that will be used in the November 4 election are not reliable and accurate, and that they are vulnerable to hacking. Moreover, he shows that three of the four companies that supply voting machines and count the votes have close links with the Republican party.</p> <p>Writing in the same magazine this month, Kennedy and Palast document large-scale election irregularities by the<br>Republicans that they believe could be enough to swing the election. Their meticulously researched <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/23638322/block_the_vote\">expose</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/player/23654789\">documentary</a> catalogue evidence that the Republicans may have already stolen the 2008 presidential vote.</p> <p>\"If Democrats are to win the 2008 election,\" Kennedy and Palast conclude, \"they must not simply beat John McCain at the polls \u2013 they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP [Republican] vote tampering.\"</p>",

  "<p>Commenter dcmcgrain asks:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yesterday Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama. And today (or sometime last night), Mr. Obama promised the American people that General Powell would have a position in Obama's administration.</p> <p>It was about a month ago that John McCain answered a question about who he would put at the head of the SEC. He said Andrew Cuomo. You accused Mr. McCain of possibly breaking the law with his statements in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/22/johnmccain.wallstreet\">this post</a>.</p> <p>First of all, Mr McCain was answering a question and named a name. He made no promise and there was no indication that he had been in contact with Mr Cuomo or his office. The law you are referring to is intended to end the good ol' Spoils System of Andrew Jackson and has done just that. Mr McCain made no promise and has received no aid from Mr Cuomo, so your accusation was absurd</p> <p>But secondly, how do you feel about Obama-Powell? Shouldn't this bit of politics be getting some attention on your blog?</p> </blockquote> <p>I have to say I think that's a fair point. We're all wrong sometimes, and I don't mind admitting that I was wrong then. And I think it was mildly inappropriate of Obama to say what he said this morning. There's no reason to suspect that there was any kind of specific deal in the works, but he should have been more circumspect about any potential Powell role.<br></p>",
  "<p>Elements of Iran's ruling clerical and political elites are enjoying the west's financial implosion. It has deflected attention from the country's internal troubles and its increased international isolation. And as the campaign for next June's presidential election gathers pace, capitalism's travails handily illustrate the supposed superiority of Iran's unique system of collectivist Islamic republicanism.</p> <p>Leading prayers in Tehran last Friday, <a href=\"http://www.metimes.com/Security/2008/10/17/ayatollah_blames_us_for_economic_woes/99e7/\">Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami</a> declared that US-promoted liberal democracy was collapsing under the weight of its moral contradictions. \"It started with an ethical downfall and has now reached an economic failure \u2026 See how sad the funeral is! Even the undertaker is crying! They tried to create a crisis for us [through UN sanctions] but God created a crisis for them.\"</p> <p>Such triumphalism is unlikely to last long or be widely shared among a population enduring 30% inflation, high unemployment, and the continuing failure of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to share Iran's oil wealth and boost family incomes as he promised. Ahmadinejad, elected in 2005, is expected to run again. But unease over his confrontational nuclear policies, his Holocaust denial, and threats against Israel are all additional reasons why he may be denied a second term.</p> <p>Recent developments have driven home the weakness of the current regime. One was the UN general assembly's vote, by a humiliating 158 to 32, to deny Iran a two-year rotational membership of the security council. John Sawers, Britain's UN ambassador, undiplomatically called the vote a \"thrashing\". Tehran blamed Zionist lobbying for what it called an \"<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE49J35520081020\">obvious injustice</a>\". But the bottom line was plain: more than three-quarters of the world's countries do not trust Iran to do the right thing under its present leadership.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's government has had to back off at home after a 3% sales tax provoked widespread protests. More significantly in terms of the coming election, the sudden halving of the global oil price has damaging implications for Iran's foreign earnings, for badly needed oil and gas investment, and for an impoverished domestic economy as a whole.</p> <p>The president's unpopularity does not automatically mean defeat. He retains the support of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, the Revolutionary Guards and ubiquitous Basij militia. He has a strong following among the less educated, rural poor. And as usual, the broadly-defined \"reformist\" opposition, consisting of numerous rivalrous individuals and factions, is badly divided, lacking a common standard-bearer.</p> <p>Mohammad Khatami, the former two-term president who disappointed many supporters with his cautious approach in office, is nevertheless most frequently mentioned as the reformists' likely candidate. The Mehr news agency reported this week that Khatami had decided not to run and had proposed a former prime minister, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, in his place. But his intentions remain unclear.</p> <p>The only declared major contender for Ahmadinejad's job so far is <a href=\"http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2392\">Mahdi Karroubi</a>, a former Majlis (parliament) speaker with a reputation as a moderate. He announced his candidacy last week. Karroubi indicated a more flexible approach to nuclear negotiations and said Iran had \"paid dearly\" for Ahmadinejad's Holocaust stance. He also hinted he might step aside if the reformists could agree to unite behind Khatami.</p> <p>All the same, opposition disunity and factionalism remain a bigger enemy than the \"principle-ists\" (fundamentalists) of the clerical right. Jahanbakhsh Khanjani of the Executives of Construction party warned recently that the reformists could win but only if they stuck together in a coalition. \"Undoubtedly convergence, solidarity and consensus will have positive effects among reformists and will set the ground for their victory,\" he told the Mardom-Salari newspaper.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad may yet face a more potent challenge from moderate conservatives such as Ali Larijani, the former nuclear negotiator who he forced out of the national security council, or Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Tehran mayor known a moderniser. Larijani is now Majlis speaker and is said to have the ear of the Supreme Leader. Lurking in the background, as ever, is Hashemi Rafsanjani, another former president and veteran consevative power-broker who was runner-up in 2005.</p> <p>Yet as Iranians look for voluntary regime change next June, all the likely candidates share one major drawback: over-familiarity. The biggest obstacle to change is apathy among an electorate where a majority is under 35. Many younger voters may think Iran, for once, should take a leaf out of the Great Satan's book and seek a \"transformational figure\" \u2013 not another regime re-tread.</p> <p>No need for Israeli or American military action: Ahmadinejad is politically vulnerable and could well be removed peacefully by his own people if the west will only wait. But first, perhaps, Iranians should find their own version of Barack Obama.</p>",
  "<p>If the latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/polls-economy\">Guardian-ICM poll</a> isn't a reality check for Gordon Brown then the words simply have no meaning. For the poll is compelling evidence that politicians and partisan commentators who should have known better have talked Brown's performance up with dizzying disregard for the political facts. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">prime minister</a> has saved the world. He commands the political scene. He is once more the dominant figure in British politics. We have read all these claims and more in the past week or two. But they are simply not true. Naturally, Brown would like them to be the case. He would like commentators to talk as if they were true. He is doing everything he can to encourage the world to take him at his own estimation. He undoubtedly sees the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> as a huge political opportunity which he is manifestly enjoying.</p> <p>Maybe in time this will be so, but the poll figures tell another truth right now. At a moment when, if the Brown hype was true, Labour would be slashing back the Conservative poll lead and forging into large leads on handling of the economy, what does ICM find? It finds that the Conservatives are on 42% and Labour on 30% \u2013 exactly where they were just after the Tory conference. The world saved \u2013 and not a single percentage point in the polls to show for it. There's gratitude for you.</p> <p>The poll tells a powerful list of uncomfortable facts. It finds that voters think David Cameron and George Osborne are a whisker ahead of Brown and Alastair Darling as the better team to manage the economy \u2013 not lost in the dust. It finds that twice as many voters are less likely to vote Labour as a result of the crisis than are more likely to do so \u2013 that's right, LESS likely, not more. And it finds that the government is seen to have been part of the problem \u2013 more people blame the UK government for the crisis than blame the US housing market or the global economy.</p> <p>In the financial markets the prices go dizzyingly up and down. The hope of Labour ministers and their followers is that politics has suddenly become as volatile as the economy. This is not the case so far \u2013 though perhaps it will become so over time. In the political markets things seem to be staying much the same. The Labour government is still unpopular. The Tories are still more likely than not to win the next election. The real lesson from the politics of October 2008 is not that everything has changed, but that it hasn't. </p> <p>Early election? No way.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/williamhill\">William Hill</a> has bolstered its underperforming internet operations by combining forces with Playtech, the Aim-listed gaming software specialist.</p> <p>Playtech will take a 29% stake in a new online gaming and sports betting operation, William Hill Online, in return for folding in $250m (\u00a3146m) worth of newly acquired affiliate businesses with a strong supply of customers as well as \"marketing and customer retention expertise\".</p> <p>William Hill, which will put its existing online assets into the joint venture, will own the rest of William Hill Online and have full operational control of it, retaining an option to buy out Playtech's share in four or six years' time. It has also agreed to use Playtech's software for poker and casino games for at least five years.</p> <p>William Hill's chief executive Ralph Topping said the company had been unable to build up its own online business from its headquarters in Leeds, so had to buy in expertise. </p> <p>Operating across Europe in undisclosed locations, the newly acquired businesses would pick up customers and \"funnel\" them to the William Hill network, he said. \"It's a simple model but there's a hell of a lot going on at the back to make it happen.\".</p> <p>William Hill has struggled to bring in sufficiently large numbers of internet gamblers at a time when the online market is growing in importance. </p> <p>\"We could not stay the way we were, it was not an option \u2014 we were weak,\" Topping said. \"This deal strengthens us. It was the right thing to do; we will have a much, much stronger business over the course of the next four years.\"</p> <p>The majority of the $250m being paid by Playtech for the affiliates is accounted for by Uniplay, a business controlled by Playtech's founder and main shareholder, 36-year-old Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi. </p> <p>Playtech still has an option to buy another five affiliates controlled by Sagi, who made a reported \u00a370m when he floated Playtech in 2006 and still retains a 41% stake in the business, worth \u00a3370m. Chief executive Mor Weizer said these other affiliates would \"not necessarily\" end up joining William Hill Online.</p> <p>Topping dismissed fears that the recession could hurt the gambling industry. \"You've still got to enjoy yourself. A couple of quid on a horse or 10 or 12 quid at the weekend, it's part and parcel of the fabric of UK life \u2014 I don't think people will give that up.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Queen has helped trigger a resurgence of interest in wind projects in the deep waters off Britain by promising to invest in projects at a time when onshore and other offshore schemes are struggling to meet their potential in the face of planning delays and other problems.</p> <p>The decision by the monarch's crown estate, to pay up to half of all pre-construction development costs, has brought a surge in applications for the latest round of wind licensing with almost 100 companies wanting to build farms far into the North Sea.</p> <p>\"The crown estate offering to be a development partner takes away much of the cost and uncertainty with third-round projects, which is why we have seen so much interest in the latest licensing round,\" said Adam Bruce, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA), on the eve of its annual conference to be opened by Gordon Brown tomorrow.</p> <p>The Queen's property arm has also shown its willingness to be at the forefront of the battle against climate change by agreeing to buy the world's biggest wind turbine, the 7.5MW Clipper Windpower MBE prototype, codenamed Project Britannia. </p> <p>The turbine, said to be powerful enough to provide power for 5,500 homes, is under construction in Blyth in north-east England, and will be eventually towed out and erected in the North Sea. </p> <p>Although deep-water projects were expensive and the cost of steel and other materials was soaring, they could be far more efficient because they could utilise larger turbines and take advantage of stronger prevailing winds, said Bruce. </p> <p>\"Unlike onshore wind schemes, the operator is also only dealing with one planning regime and one landlord in the crown estate which is now offering to be a partner,\" he added.</p> <p>The organisation, which has responsibility for licensing the seabed up to 200 miles off-shore for renewable projects, will help pay for the cost of undertaking studies on what impact a particular wind plan would have on shipping and marine life.</p> <p>The cost of doing that will later be clawed back from revenues once the wind turbines are turning. Ninety-six companies expressed their interest by last month in becoming involved in the third licensing round, far more than in previous rounds. The crown estate is considering the offers and will make a decision on who will win the chance to proceed with schemes on 11 favoured sites, called zones.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the crown estate said the response to the licensing round had \"greatly exceeded our expectations\". The crown estate, which owns large parts of Regent Street, London as well as 55% of Britain's foreshore, traces its history back to the reign of King George the Third, who swapped much of his land for a fixed income from the Treasury.</p> <p>The deep-water interest is a welcome boost for the wind industry which is still hobbled by problems that ministers have repeatedly promised to sort out. <br>A new planning bill is meant to streamline wind projects but the BWEA pointed out today in a new review that half of the 7GW of wind capacity stuck in the planning system is located in Scotland and not covered by the legislation, while a further 3.5GW is below a 50MW threshold.</p> <p>There are still difficulties, with the ministry of defence and the aviation industry over the alleged threat to radar coverage posed by wind turbines. Government has again promised help resolve these difficulties but problems remain.</p> <p>\"It is not possible to quantify the risk to a project from an aviation perspective - the objections cannot be easily predicted and a pre-planning statement of no objection is not always valid through the planning process,\" says the BWEA. </p> <p>The prime minister will reiterate his determination to clear any logjams and ensure wind reaches its potential. Brown will say that his decision to create an dedicated energy and climate change department is proof of how seriously he takes both global warming and energy security. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Carbon Trust will tomorrow announce that it has reached agreement with five major energy companies under which \u00a330m will be invested to find ways to reduce the cost of offshore wind by at least 10%. </p> <p>Airtricity, ScottishPower Renewables and StatoilHydro will work with RWE Innogy and DONG Energy to research and develop ways of cutting costs and improving efficiency at wind farms at a time of mounting concern that rising costs are chasing investors away from renewables.</p> <p>The move comes just days after the Carbon Trust, an organisation established by government to help speed up the introduction of clean energy, unveiled a report showing that ministers would fail to meet their offshore wind goals unless a variety of measures were introduced. Among proposals was one allowing operators to develop a new generation of wind farms closer to shore.</p>",
  "<p>Washington DC is a candidate for the title of least sexy city in the world. It's a place where adult men still wear <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/tucker_carlson/index.html\">bow ties</a> in daylight without a hint of irony. So it's all the more surprising that the heads of Washington's most powerful institutions have trouble keeping their pants on.</p> <p>It's not just the politicians. Last year Paul Wolfowitz's brief and unhappy tenure as president of the World Bank dissolved amid a scandal involving promotions and pay rises awarded to his then partner, who also worked at the bank. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/18/imf.economics\">Wolfowitz resigned</a> amid a welter of claims of ethical misconduct. Now it's the turn of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who found himself on the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122427783161845699.html\">front page of the Wall Street Journal on Saturday</a> over an affair he appears to have had with an IMF employee.</p> <p>In Wolfowitz's case, his signature policy at the World Bank was crusading against corruption and championing the cause of good governance. So when details emerged of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/15/usnews.imf\">Wolfowitz's conduct</a> and his inappropriate behaviour, his position at the head of the bank became untenable. Strauss-Kahn has no such problems, but because of the precedent set by the treatment of Wolfowitz, solid evidence of any similar impropriety would put his position in doubt.</p> <p>In Strauss-Kahn's case the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/world/19imf.html\">details</a> appear to be that he had an affair with Piroska Nagy, a senior female IMF economist, at a conference earlier this year. Her husband found out - and he was a former IMF economist. Nagy later took voluntary redundancy from the fund - along with 600 others during the IMF's massive restructuring. The <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49H19920081019\">questions being investigated</a> hinge on whether Nagy was pressured to leave, or whether she received preferential treatment or payment in her redundancy agreement.</p> <p>Nagy's lawyers say she got the same payoff as everyone else, and that she wasn't <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/10/18/no-pressure-on-hire-of-woman-tied-to-strauss-kahn-ebrd-says/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">pressured</a> in any way. Strauss-Kahn describes it as an \"incident which occurred in my private life\". His wife, the French TV broadcaster Anne Sinclair, says it was a <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQGicZ5mK3PXlq3tVvyHGXFLZ7Mw\">one-night stand</a>. No one, so far, has produced any evidence suggesting anything more sinister, although the IMF engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation before the affair became public knowledge.</p> <p>Obviously, with the world in a financial crisis of hitherto unimaginable dimensions, the timing isn't great. Having the head of the IMF tied up with lawyers while the global capital markets collapse isn't very helpful - but perhaps Strauss-Kahn should have thought of that earlier. Even without any pressure or payoffs involved, institutions such as the bank and the fund have strict rules about staff relationships, for good reason, and the heads of those institutions should adhere to them.</p> <p>(One sidelight is that if DSK - as he's known - is forced out, then Gordon Brown has an escape-route away from No 10 Downing Street if he so desires, by taking the IMF top job - one he has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/05/uk.economy\">considered in the past</a>, by many accounts.)</p> <p>But why did a tabloid scandal turn into the front page splash of the Wall Street Journal? Tempting though it may be to blame the recent purchase of the Journal by Rupert Murdoch, there's much more going on here involving Washington's multinational power politics. One possibility is that the US, in particular, is open to getting payback for the Wolfowitz humiliation - and the US's most senior representative at the IMF played a role (according to the WSJ), along with the Russians, in pushing for an investigation. The Journal itself also took Wolfowitz's side last year - its comment pages became a caricature of right-wing rage on the subject (although that isn't unusual for the Journal, it has to be said).</p> <p>Along those lines, DSK is not popular with some of the fund's executive directors, including the US, for his desire to make the IMF a more progressive place, particularly his desire to dilute practices such as \"conditionality\" - the quid pro quo conditions imposed on those countries - most often the world's poorest - to which it gives assistance.</p> <p>The Americans were also unhappy at the fund's most recent health check of the US economy and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/09/useconomy.subprimecrisis\">criticism</a> of US policy. (And the fund was vindicated by recent events - contrary to what some believe, the IMF has long criticised the US for precisely those policies that led to the financial crisis.)</p> <p>So far this seems to be little more than an embarrassment for Strauss-Kahn. But that could change. If Strauss-Kahn is found to have intervened on the woman's behalf (whether benevolently or maliciously) then he will be under pressure to go the same way as Wolfowitz. Or if other, similar affairs are revealed, a similar outcome can be expected.</p> <p>The incongruity here is that the current financial crisis has suddenly made the IMF relevant again, just when it was in danger of losing its reason for existing. Now it's doing what is supposed to be doing, all over the world. Maybe if being head of the World Bank or IMF wasn't regarded as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/18/usnews.imf\">sinecure</a> for sidelined male politicians from the developed world, then there might be more newsworthy activity in the boardroom than in the bedroom.</p>",
  "<p>The Home Office is in active talks with trade unions in an attempt to persuade them to abandon opposition to the imminent introduction of compulsory ID cards for airport workers. </p> <p>Meg Hillier, the minister in charge of ID cards and passports, today promised there would be no delays to the \u00a34.7bn programme despite the threat of a UK economic recession. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian ahead of a conference on biometric security checks in London tomorrow, she said many unions privately disapproved of a motion adopted by the TUC last month.</p> <p>The motion, proposed by the airline pilots' union BALPA, calls for industrial and legal action to oppose the requirement from next year that all \"airside\" workers carry an ID card.</p> <p>\"Not all trade unions think that the position is one that should remain,\" Hillier, who is addressing the Biometrics 2008 conference, said. \"They point out the benefits: tackling illegal working, protecting their British members and protecting those working legally from exploitation. I'm talking to individual trade unions.\"</p> <p>ID cards would save employers money by speeding up security checks for airside workers. \"Some are now paying up to \u00a3180 for checks on [potential] members of staff, whereas with ID cards it's all done,\" Ms Hiller said. </p> <p>The first ID cards, for foreign nationals, will be introduced next month followed by those for airport workers in 2009. Young people will be targeted in 2010 and from 2012 everyone applying for a passport will be put on the national identity register.</p> <p>ID cards, which carry the users' fingerprints, will be valid travel documents with the EU and ministers hope that young people will see them as a cheap alternative - at \u00a330 - to purchasing a \u00a372 passport.</p> <p>Ministers met last week to discuss the government's ID strategy, Hillier said. The Home Office's priority is security but other departments are enthusiastic about its potential as a convenient means of proving people's ages and identity in day-to-day transactions.</p> <p>The enrolment procedure can use facial imaging if there is a problem with fingerprints \u2013 for example officials confirmed that some racial groups, particularly those from Polynesian islands in the Pacific, have less pronounced ridges in their fingerprints. Face recognition technology relies chiefly on detecting the distance between people's eyes - a characteristic that cannot be altered even by plastic surgery. </p> <p>The Home Office has been studying work carried out by the US port authorities on reading the fingerprints of dock workers whose fingers have been worn smooth by hard manual labour.</p> <p>Hillier said that trials of automated facial recognition gates at Manchester airport have been successful. The gates match up passengers' to the image of their face in the latest generation of passports.</p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), which represents immigration officers in Manchester, has claimed that it is possible to \"tailgate\" - for two people to pass through a scanner when the image of the passenger behind has not been checked.</p> <p>\"There's a number of concerns about the accuracy of the machines,\" a PCS spokesman told the Guardian last week. \"There are people sat there for three hours at a time when they should be doing 20 minute stints. </p> <p>\"It's possible to tailgate. Our concerns that the accuracy will never be right unless you use humans [to check passports] as well.\"</p> <p>The Home Office maintains that \"gates cannot be forced without sounding an alarm.

  "<p>I am asked if we can spend our way out of a recession? I write against a silly political background, where the left is trying to annex <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/economy-recession-treasury-energy-housing\">Keynes</a> again, as if he were a leftwing figure whose views had been buried by Conservative monetarists and deregulators. The truth is very different.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher kept <a href=\"http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=110368\">her copy</a> of the 1944 white paper on employment, which incorporated some of Keynes's perceptions. She used it in one of her big party conference speeches. Conservative economists working since Keynes have usually drawn on his insights as well as the views of others. It was a Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, who officially incorporated monetarist thinking into UK government economic policy making, when he recognised that more public borrowing in an inflationary era would make matters worse.</p> <p>Of course in one sense you can only overcome a recession by more spending. A recession is insufficient demand chasing too many goods and services, leading to job losses, falling prices and cuts in output. The issue is not whether we need more demand or not, but how you bring that about. Confidence is a precious flower, and can be easily damaged if governments take the wrong decisions.</p> <p>The priority is to encourage more private sector demand, because it is private sector demand which is falling sharply. You do that by cutting interest rates substantially. I have been calling for cuts to head off recession for many months. The authorities are far too slow, persisting wrongly in thinking inflation is next year's problem when recession is next year's problem. Lower interest rates feed through immediately to borrowers whose rates are linked to the minimum lending rate, and later will benefit others as money markets start to function better.</p> <p>We need more confidence and cash in the system. That is why the Conservative leadership has backed the banking package in its entirety, to give it the best possible chance of succeeding. Until there is more confidence there will be insufficient private sector demand. The gap will be too large for an overborrowed public sector to be able to fill, even if the government took the risk of expanding public borrowing even more than it is already doing.</p> <p>If the government presses ahead with borrowing \u00a337bn for bank capital, its scope for further borrowing to undertake counter-cyclical works will be even more limited. I think they should spend some time amending the package, to get as much of the new banking capital from private sources as possible. This would leave them with a little more flexibility.</p> <p>As it is, we are facing a huge overrun on borrowing compared with budget. The downturn itself and other policy changes announced so far have probably boosted borrowing by \u00a320bn this year, on top of the \u00a337bn for the banks. This means a borrowing requirement forecast at \u00a343bn could exceed \u00a3100bn. Government needs to keep confidence in its own powers to raise money. These figures are large. Given the delay in trying to get new, larger capital projects off the shelf and into action, and given the high borrowing requirement, I do not see a lot of scope for the government on its own to spend us out of recession on this year's budget. It has to find other ways of allowing the private sector to pick up.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson is set to face the wrath of the Commons business and<br>enterprise committee tomorrow, after he floated two controversial reform proposals today.</p> <p>The new business secretary is considering delaying the extension of family-friendly employment reforms.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/mandelson-economy\">TUC said a U-turn on family friendly hours</a> would be \"an astonishingly irrelevant response\" to problems facing the economy.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson also threw his weight behind plans to partially privatise the Royal Mail.</p> <p>In an interview with the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b4504a64-9e2e-11dd-bdde-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1\">Financial Times, Mandelson</a> said that if he had stayed as trade and industry secretary in 1998, he would have allowed the private sector to buy stakes in Royal Mail. </p> <p>\"If I had not been forced to resign, it would have happened \u2026 Frankly, 10 years on I was surprised this was still an unresolved issue.\"</p> <p>The plans have sparked fury among trade unionists and the Labour left, who believe the Royal Mail should remain under state control, despite its dire financial state.</p> <p>Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union, which represents 160,000 members across the Royal Mail Group, said that Mandelson's plan was at odds with long-standing government commitments.</p> <p>\"Peter Mandelson has only just come back into government, but he should be aware that there is a clear commitment from the Labour government to keep Royal Mail in the public sector, restated earlier this year at the national policy forum in Warwick.</p> <p>\"At a time of economic instability the last thing the British public wants to hear is that privatisation is the solution to Royal Mail's problems. A lot has changed in the last ten years. The postal industry needs solutions which address today's issues, not the issues of a decade ago.\"</p> <p>At Labour's national policy forum in Warwick in July, the party reached an agreement with trade unions that the Post Office would remain in the public sector.</p> <p>Critics of Mandelson also point to Labour's election manifesto of 2005 that read: \"We have given the Royal Mail greater commercial freedom and have no plans to privatise it.\"</p> <p>At tomorrow's meeting of the Commons business and enterprise committee angry Labour MPs are expected to vent their fury at Mandelson.</p> <p>The business secretary will face MPs for the first time since taking up his new post.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the Labour leftwinger, was quick to hit out at Mandelson's plans. \"Peter Mandelson has only been back for a short time and he is already undermining progressive reforms,\" he said.</p> <p>His colleague John Grogan joined the attack, saying Mandelson's proposals would cause unrest on the Labour backbenches:</p> <p>\"If Peter was to swan back in from Brussels and start the whole debate again about selling shares that would cause some dismay on the Labour backbenches. His task is to support British business in hard times rather than float ideas like this.\"</p> <p>Royal Mail made a loss for the first time in its history in the last financial year. Peter Luff, the Conservative chair of the committee, agreed with Mandelson that only privatisation will reverse its fortunes. </p> <p>\"This is one of the most difficult decisions the new secretary of state faces. The Royal Mail group faces increasing private sector competition and the logic of what he says is very strong indeed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hold very tightly, please, ladies and gentlemen. The announcement of the winner of the mayor of London's competition for the design of a new London bus, or Mk 2 Routemaster, is just around the corner. Here's one of the designs - an electric double-decker called the e21, powered by rechargeable batteries - submitted by Michael Kerz, a graduate of Central St Martin's School of Art and Design. </p> <p>Given that the original Routemaster, one of the finest of all city buses, appeared at a time when diesel oil was a lot cheaper than it is today, perhaps it's right that a new generation RM should be electric. But, just as the much-missed Routemaster has long been seen as a tourist attraction, so Kerz's design plays on the fact; his e21 boasts a full length transparent roof so tourists can gawp at passing pediments, plane trees and pigeons as Londoners flick through newspapers, grimace along to the thumpa-whompa-tss-tss-tss of personal stereos, doze, eat, drink and fight. </p> <p>Like the Mk 1 Routemaster, Kerz's Mk 2 sports an open rear platform, beloved by generations of Londoners, but condemned by Transport for London officials as being too dangerous. An automatic safety barrier would keep would-be leapers in control until the bus had stopped, but surely this undermines the very nature of an open platform: the chance to get on and off anywhere along central London's congested streets, no faster than they were in the days of horse-drawn buses. </p> <p>Kerz, as you can see has tried to borrow something of the Routemaster's profile, but it must be said that the e21 does look just a little angular and brutal compared with the functional elegance of the gently curved original. With its big whizzy wheels and aggressive, cartoon-like stance, the e21 looks better suited to Wacky Races than Route 11.</p> <p>Next week, we should find out what Transport for London's judges feel about designs from Kerz, other design students, architects - including Norman Foster, whose entry just happens to resemble a trolleybus - engineers, industrial designers and others. The panel, it's good to know, is 100 per cent celebrity-free and composed wholly of those who, if the new bus does go ahead, will run it in daily service. </p> <p>I suggest that the winning design ought to be in the spirit of the Routemaster and its predecessors, stretching back to the London General B-Type double-decker of 1910, but may well look nothing like it. A true a successor to the Routemaster should be a truly modern city bus designed for a long and trouble-free life and as energy and space efficient as technically possible.</p> <p>A new Routemaster mustn't be fashionable and it cannot be aimed primarily at the tourist market. It has to be at least 10 times better looking than contemporary London buses, which are bought off the shelf. It doesn't need video screens inside (please not; surely Londoners can still read or simply enjoy looking out of the window?). It needs a quiet engine, however powered, as well as silent brakes. Oh, and it needs a grown-up interior design - unlike 99 per cent of contemporary London buses. </p> <p>Most of all, the RM2 must be a London bus. London is one of the richest cities in the world, supposedly one of the most creative, and together we must find a way to commission a bus that, one day, will be as famous and as respected as the original Routemaster. We'll soon find out.</p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mandelson-halts-flexitime-reforms-966910.html\">rumours are true</a>, and one of the first acts Peter Mandelson takes as newly appointed secretary of state for business is to axe any <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/WorkingHoursAndTimeOff/DG_10029491\">extension to flexible working</a>, he risks making one of the gravest mistakes of his political career. </p> <p>Such a move would demonstrate not only that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/oct/20/mandelson-post\">Mandelson</a> had wilfully discounted a growing body of evidence that shows the benefits of flexible working for business and employees alike, but that he had badly misjudged the political mood.</p> <p>If Mandelson were to row back on flexibility he would cut off at the knees one of the most <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=79\">potentially transformational</a> pieces of legislation the Labour government has introduced. </p> <p>One of the biggest barriers to mothers' employment is that most jobs simply don't marry with family commitments. But, for once, the right to request flexible working is a piece of legislation that is on their side. It has allowed them to have a conversation with their employers about whether they can find another way of doing business beyond the nine to five, five-day week. Small changes can have a major impact for the employee: starting half an hour later in order to do the morning drop off at the nursery, or home working on a Friday to be at the school gates once a week, can make working life possible for parents in the UK. It is also one route to encouraging fathers to play a more active role in the home. And Mandelson can take solace in the fact that while being visionary, he is still protecting businesses, as the legislation gives employers the right to refuse any requests if it would damage their business interest. </p> <p>But perhaps more compelling still for Mandelson is the negative political fallout that would follow any move to dismantle flexible working. Voters are currently scrutinising every political move to see whether, when tested, the government has really got their best interests at heart. And this is especially true of women voters who are generally more sceptical of the political process and less convinced by political posturing. One thing that has changed since Mandelson has been at the EU is the fact that Labour has some serious political competition on this issue and David Cameron is using this opportunity for all it is worth to demonstrate his continued commitment to measures that support women in the labour market. Yes, the Labour party invented this agenda and the influx of women Labour MPs in 1997 has provided the driving force that has made it a reality. But when the voters come to make their decisions, they will decide not on delivery in the past but on the commitments made for the future. Mandelson would be well advised to pause before he abandons that commitment.</p>",
  "<p>Certain tracks on my iPod are tried and tested for whenever I'm training and have a hard session to finish. Evanescence's Bring Me to Life, Zombie by the Cranberries plus Whatever (I Had a Dream) by Butthole Surfers are fun yet give me a push at the same time. I tend to keep a lot of familiar stuff on the iPod; I find it is less of a distraction.</p> <p>Earlier in the year I got into downloading the Podrunner podcast before hitting the road for training runs. It's an hour of music at a set tempo. Most of the tunes seem to be nameless electronica and it's all rather abstract - it isn't what I would normally listen to but it's a bit of a change.</p> <p>It's very easy to get something annoying stuck in my head while I'm competing. I've ended up singing Sheryl Crow's Run, Baby, Run to myself more than once. And in this year's Ironman UK I spent the whole of the first lap on my bike doing Baby One More Time by Britney Spears. Devastating. I was relieved when that finally left me.</p> <p>In terms of music the funniest event I've ever taken part in was Ironman Germany in 2006.

  "<p>Consumers have been warned that their broadband bills could soar after the EU opened the door to \"net neutrality\" \u2014 unrestricted, first-come-first-served access to the internet.</p> <p>Amid warnings that the internet was becoming congested, experts said European consumers could end up paying billions of euros more for new broadband platforms under net neutrality.</p> <p>A new Centre for European Policy Studies paper due to be published this week says the US model would oblige normal users to subsidise heavy users, would give no incentive to service providers to invest in new-generation networks and encourage \"free-riding\" by applications and content providers.</p> <p>The warnings come before high-level talks in Venice later this week between Viviane Reding, EU media commissioner, and the heads of global telecommunications and cable operators.</p> <p>Net neutrality is due to be discussed by the EU's 27 telecoms ministers next month when they put the finishing touches to legislation designed to improve regulation, encourage investment and offer broadband coverage to all of Europe's 500 million citizens.</p> <p>Industry sources said Reding, MEPs and the current French presidency of the EU had opened the back door to net neutrality by tabling amendments to the universal service directive, part of the telecoms package. This would enable national regulators to set minimum quality of service requirements to prevent \"degradation\" of service or slowing of traffic over networks.</p> <p>The internet is becoming congested because a single movie download in high definition requires as much data as 2300 songs or 35,000 web pages, according to new research from Copenhagen experts sponsored by the telecoms industry. YouTube consumes as much bandwidth as the entire internet did eight years ago.</p> <p>Reding's proposals to handle this congestion have pitched service providers such as telecoms operators against application/content providers such as Google, a process she has described as \"arm wrestling\" between the two sides over \"hard cash: dollars and euros\".</p> <p>But national regulators, such as Ofcom in the UK, are reluctant to endorse net neutrality. Ed Richards, Ofcom chief executive, said today: \"We don't think we should bring it over from the US lock, stock and barrel. We have quite often got more competitors in Europe than in the US.</p> <p>\"The key for us is transparency. Consumers must know whether there are different arrangements for different ISPs and network providers must have the freedom to make commercial decisions about how to run their networks and invest in new-generation networks.\"</p> <p>Separately, Richards urged the EU to endorse the telecoms package and strengthened independent regulation rather than revert to an era of protected national monopolies run by political whim. This was critical, he said, to ensure growth potential and attract scarce capital to information and communications technology and creative industries.</p> <p>Richards indicated that the 27 telecoms ministers were now more likely to adopt compromise proposals removing the unconstrained powers of the European Commission to veto decisions by national regulators.</p> <p>The proposed compromise would hand greater influence to the European Regulators' Group (ERG). The ERG, in turn, could be beefed up with more staff and resources and act as a \"college of supervisors\" for the European industry now that Reding's plan for a European communications market agency under Brussels control had been defeated.</p>",
  "<p>The mother of a boy accused of assisting the alleged murderer of the schoolboy Rhys Jones broke down in tears today as she told Liverpool crown court how her son had been bullied by gangsters.</p> <p>The mother of Boy M, who cannot be named, said Sean Mercer, 18, had not been to her house for about four months when he arrived after 11-year-old Rhys was shot dead in a pub car park in August last year. </p> <p>The woman told the jury Mercer was joined at the house about 20 minutes later by James Yates, 20, and Nathan Quinn, who turned 18 today and therefore can be named publicly. </p> <p>Boy M, now 16, who at the age of 11 was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, used to \"tag along\" with Mercer and his gang \"like a little lost sheep\", Richard Pratt, the boy's barrister, told the court. <br>His mother said: \"I told him to stay away from them but he didn't take any notice.\" </p> <p>Starting to cry, she added: \"He would say things without thinking and do things without thinking.\"<br> The jury was told her son \"was afraid of being called a grass\", having been beaten up in 2006 for naming members of Mercer's gang, the Croxteth Crew, to police after a shooting incident. Windows of the family home were also smashed at the time.</p> <p>The woman said her son had become reclusive after he was beaten up and had not left the house for two years.</p> <p>He also stopped taking medication for his condition, and was nearly 20 kilos lighter than his normal weight. Her son's memory had worsened and he would become frustrated, angry and unpleasant, she said. </p> <p>The woman told the court Mercer had phoned her son on September 3, when the police were at the house to take her statement. </p> <p>He had also arrived at the family home after his arrest with Dan Forshaw \u2013 who, it was \"common knowledge\", had beaten him up in 2006, she said.</p> <p>Boy M refused to join his six co-defendants in the dock today because he did not want to see his mother give evidence, the jury was told. </p> <p>He denies three counts of assisting an offender - namely, dumping the murder weapon, the bicycle and clothes used during the shooting. </p> <p>Mercer denies murder; his co-accused - James Yates, 20, Gary Kays and Melvin Coy, both 25, Nathan Quinn, 18, and a 17-year-old - deny assisting an offender.</p>",
  "<p>Mercedes Leon tries to stay away from politics at family gatherings, but inevitably, the subject comes up when she and her 26-year-old son, Enrique, get together.</p> <p>She is a conservative Republican and Cuban exile who is running for Florida state attorney this year. Her son is a liberal Democrat, born in Orlando, who defines himself as \"very anti-Republican\".</p> <p>She believes in small government and tax breaks. He thinks there should be universal health care.</p> <p>He tells her the Republican party only cares about the rich. And she - who survived a shipwreck while fleeing the Communist island to come to Florida in 1980 - hurls at him the worst political insult a Cuban-American can bestow on another: \"I end up calling him a communist, and I tell him, 'You sound like [Fidel] Castro.'\"</p> <p>That's usually when Enrique Leon storms out.</p> <p>Their arguments may not always be so dramatic, but they illustrate what appears to be a growing generational split among Cuban-Americans. Despite their traditional support of Republicans, their political views are more diverse than meets the eye.</p> <p>\"We get in huge fights about these issues. I mean huge - even at birthday dinners,\" said Mercedes Leon, a 45-year-old attorney from Kissimmee. \"The younger generation is too idealistic.\"</p> <p>Older Cubans, who have been a reliable source of votes for Republicans, are still driven by their harrowing experiences as exiles from a Communist regime.</p> <p>But second-generation Cubans, and even recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived after the Mariel boatlift in 1980, are beginning to shatter the stereotype of the one-party voting bloc. \"I'm much more concerned about what happens in domestic policy,\" said Enrique Leon, a Kissimmee accountant. \"In regards to Cuba, I don't believe we should interfere with their form of government. That's more of their domestic problem.\"</p> <p>Florida is ground zero for these voters, particularly in the southern region where the bulk of Florida's 1.1 million Cubans reside. </p> <p>Although an estimated 25,400 Cubans live in Orlando's metropolitan area, they are an influential group that includes business and community leaders. Most Cubans in the state are US citizens.</p> <p>Their broadening political orientation, however, is a gradual process that has yet to yield a substantial number of Democrats.</p> <p>A recent study of voting behaviour among Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade county found that they voted mostly Republican in the last presidential election - with nearly 70% support for the GOP. However, other survey questions showed their views straying from conservative values on gay marriage, gun control and even abortion.</p> <p>\"There's potential for political change, but there is no reason to think it's going to happen quickly or soon,\" said Benjamin Bishin, the study's chief author and a political science professor at the University of California, Riverside. \"People with the more hard-line views who describe themselves as conservatives on the [Cuban] embargo and the travel ban are disproportionately eligible to be registered voters and to participate in the election.\"</p> <p>Those voters are also more visible.</p> <p>While some young voters of Cuban heritage preferred not to be quoted on their political views, regulars at Sociedad Cubana de Orlando, a social club in south Orlando, were not shy about saying what was on their minds.</p> <p>On a recent Friday evening at the club, where several cars parked outside sported bumper stickers in support of Senator John McCain that read Estamos Unidos (we are united), four men were deeply engaged in a dominoes match. They were quick to draw a comparison between Senator Barack Obama and their community's historical nemesis.</p> <p>\"Once upon a time there was a mister who rose up in Cuba saying, 'We want change,' and his name was Fidel Castro Ruz,\" said Ted Turvelo, 71. \"And now, 'change' is Obama's slogan.\"</p> <p>Another common thread among exiles is their suspicion of big government because in Cuba, the one-party bureaucracy controls everything. They prefer a pro-business society that is consistent with McCain's vision.</p> <p>\"I don't like wealth redistribution. I work very hard and, if I choose to divide my wealth, that is my business, but redistribution is what socialism is all about,\" said Vicky Llevada, an exile who directs a local non-profit.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, the presidential candidates have split on issues related to Cuba, appealing to different sides of the political divide. McCain favours the embargo and toughened travel restrictions. Obama would lift the travel ban and would even meet with Cuban leaders.</p> <p>Obama's openness to a new Cuba policy doesn't bother Lili Milanes, an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Central Florida. Her father, Jorge, is a Cuban exile. Her mother, Cecilia, is a second-generation Cuban from New Jersey.<br>\"The country's policy on Cuba [is really bad]. Just because Cuba is Communist doesn't mean that it is contagious and we can't go and visit and see how everyone lives,\" Milanes said. \"I would like to go to Cuba.\"</p> <p>Showcasing Cubans' emerging diversity of views, her exiled father co-wrote a Spanish-language song set to Cuban folk music that has been posted on YouTube. The lyrics encourage people to vote for Obama: \"We don't want war and bombs,\" the song goes, \"we want music and roast pork.\"</p>",

  "<p>\"It's because of you people that our children are dying of heroin addiction,\" said my boss years ago when I worked at a German TV station. He had just found out that I was Afghan. I stood my ground but I never forgot his words. Recently, President Karzai has been hearing similar views. That's why when he tours the west, he often apologises on behalf of his people: sorry for the poppies! Then back home he tells Afghans that drugs have tarnished their reputation abroad. </p> <p>For the majority of Afghan poppy farmers, reputation is the least of their worries. One of them summed up the reason: \"Do you think they give us visas to go abroad anyway?\" Their concerns is much more acute.

Read <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSISL17460320080429?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews\">this article</a> to understand that the Taliban is using suicide bombers to attack government eradication campaigns. This is the Afghan side of the story. The government is protecting serious drug smugglers, while small farmers are forced to seek Taliban protection. Little wonder, than, that Afghans compare their government to a bowl of thin soup, it's so watery and lacking in substance.</p> <p>Now let's look at the story outside of Afghanistan. I learned about this aspect between early 2005 and end of 2007 when poppies entered my professional life. As part of my job I'd sift through hundreds of local and international reports on the Afghan drugs trade and compile a monthly summary. The first time I saw the pile of reports, my trainer reassured me: \"You'll get a feel for it. Look out for new trends, official policy announcements and arrests.\" Sounds exciting, right? But I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. There were very few arrests, most of them along the Tajik border where petty smugglers were either caught or injured in shoot-outs. There was clearly not much money involved because on the way back from Tajikistan, solitary smugglers often tried to steal some cows to make up their profits. As to foreign countries' policies, such was their repetitive nature that I soon had them memorised. You could wake me up from deep sleep at three in the morning and ask: What's Russia's stance on Afghan drugs? And I'd shoot back: \"Angry at Nato's failure to control the situation and a desire for greater involvement. And they keep talking about the need for a security belt to cut off southern Russia from Afghan drug-trafficking routes. They plan to open an office in Kabul and they offer training to Afghan officials.\" (More recently, 18 Afghan officials expected for training in Russia didn't show up, much to Russian annoyance. It seems the Afghan side has some trust issues.)</p> <p>And the Iranians? Also angry with Nato for the same reason. They say they are losing soldiers in shoot-outs with drug traffickers. They have threatened to build a wall along the Afghan border. There are reports that underage Afghan drug smugglers are kept imprisoned in Iran until they turn 18 when they can be hanged. Iranian officials denied the reports. The US? Keep suggesting aerial spraying. In one village the population suspected secret overnight spraying when they woke up to find mysterious diseases had affected their crop and livestock. Kabul promised an investigation but nothing happened. The UK? Against spraying but otherwise dithering, with no clear plan. Incidentally, the Taliban is equally divided when it comes to drugs policy. Some Taliban believe that rolling a joint after a good day of fighting is fine since Islam only bans alcohol explicitly but not cannabis. Others believe that the ban includes alcohol and all drugs. There has been some serious theological hairsplitting on this in Pakistan's Waziristan.</p> <p>In view of this chaotic situation, it's not surprising that when it comes to the relationship between the drugs trade and the west, the Afghan rumor bazaar is bustling. Let me introduce you to one of the more outlandish theories making rounds and gaining ground. The theory is that the foreign forces stationed in Afghanistan are themselves involved in drug smuggling. What kind of feverish mind could have come up with this surreal story, you are asking? The answer is simple: Hollywood. The guilty party seems to have been the recent Ridley Scott movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/\">American Gangster</a>, which has fuelled people's imagination in Afghanistan about the way the west gets its drugs. The theory is that the film is not fictional but draws inspiration from what is happening in Afghanistan right now. In other words, that US army planes leave Afghanistan carrying coffins empty of bodies but filled with drugs. The champions of this conspiracy theory say this explains why poppy production has increased in exactly the same provinces where foreign troops are stationed. The rumour has now taken on pan-Asian proportions. Look at what happened when Ali Larijani, Iran's parliamentary speaker, recently went to Geneva. He told Andres Johnson, the secretary general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, \"The majority of Afghan drugs are transported to the west via three airports that are under Nato control.\" The report was given the title: \"Revealed: The role of Nato airbases in transporting Afghan drugs to Europe\". Iranian websites endlessly reproduced it.</p> <p>Against this background of mistrust, it's not surprising that Nato's recent announcement that its troops are to directly target the drugs business fell flat. Zalmai Afzali, the spokesperson for the Afghan counter-narcotics ministry, told a local newspaper: \"We are not overtly optimistic because in the past too Nato made many promises that never materialised.\" Hajji Hanif Hanifi, an MP from Uruzgan province, said: \"I don't think they'll succeed because in the last seven years, despite huge amounts of money and the use of the police force, the government failed to stop drug smuggling. So they are not going to succeed in the future either.\"</p> <p>The Afghan paper Hasht-e Sobh had a different angle. An editorial headlined \"<a href=\"http://www.8am.af/mashroh/1387/mizan/issue407/2.html\">Yet another strategic change</a>\" said, \"The main facilitators, the biggest drug smugglers, do not reside in Afghanistan. Hence, it's not going to be easy to catch or arrest them.\" The paper drew comparison to the failed search for Osama bin Laden and concluded with the words, \"We have no reason to be optimistic.\"</p> <p>With no clear and coherent drug policy between the Afghan government, the neighbouring countries and the wider international community, few Afghans on the ground believe that the drugs business can be curbed.</p>",
  "<p>The technology has been installed in 21 double deckers on \"a north London route\" - unnamed because it might distort the trial - for the next six months, and the results will be evaluated in partnership with CCTV expert Professor Martin Gill from the University of Leicester.

  "<p>If the Republicans lose on November 4 they will no doubt spend a good portion of the next four years soul searching and whining, as Democrats have for the past eight. For much of this they will blame Barack Obama. But I also hope they blame Hank Paulson, author and midwife of the federal government's plan to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/us-banks-bailout-bush\">buy $250bn of preferred stock in the nation's largest banks</a>.</p> <p>The Republican party is supposed to be the party of the free market. So how did we get from there to here? In 2000 George Bush ran for president as something called a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EED8173EF931A25755C0A9669C8B63\">compassionate conservative</a>, which Bush described obscurely as \"first and foremost springing from the heart\". But the heart, Bush was quick to insist, must be set free. The word \"regulations\" or its variants crops up 28 times in the 2000 platform, and Bush wasn't asking for more of them. Instead, he was fond of mocking Al Gore for presiding over a regulatory bureaucracy that had (in his telling) one agency to <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E1D71E3FF933A25755C0A9669C8B63\">uphold safety standards for pepperoni pizza</a> and one for plain.</p> <p>But in practice, freedom plus compassion meant an incoherent mix-tape of lower taxes and higher discretionary spending, coupled with a couple hundred billon dollars in new entitlement spending, like the Medicare prescription drug bill. The have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too theory on government extended to a new emphasis on \"voluntary regulations\", which are a lot like ordinary regulations except no one actually follows them. These included a critical 2004 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27sec.html\">decision by the SEC</a> that freed up the amount of debt the brokerage units of investment banks could take on.</p> <p>Then in 2004 Bush ran for re-election by promising to hail in something called the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/19/bush-ownership-society/\">ownership society</a>. This had two big themes. The first was privatising social security. That didn't take. The second was promoting home ownership, and that \u2013 annoyingly \u2013 did. Bush's 2004 stump speech trumpeted the \"fantastic news\" that home ownership was at an all-time high: \"Isn't it wonderful to have somebody for the first time be able to say: 'Welcome to my home; I'm glad you're here at my piece of property'?\"</p> <p>This was also ostensibly about expanding the virtues of the free market. Bush <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/mgrind.day.tue/index.html\">said</a> that in the 2004 election \"the American people will decide between two visions of government: a government that encourages ownership and opportunity and responsibility, or a government that takes your money and makes your choices\". Actually, it turned out that Americans didn't have to decide between the two visions of government at all. We were more than happy to own things we couldn't afford, and only slightly less happy to let the government make the choices about how to clean this up. Not much of a governing philosophy, in words.</p> <p>Which brings us to Paulson. Here, too, there is much irony. The big criticism of Paulson's predecessor, the chronically lethargic John Snow, was that he did an insufficient job of talking up the economy's strengths. When Paulson was nominated for the job two years ago the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/business/31treasury.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;adxnnlx=1224086503-FNkrAxD7XVZXmquv7xb6fg\">reported</a> that he \"initially rebuffed overtures\" because the job was \"widely viewed as having declined in influence and prestige during Mr Bush's presidency\". Only after wining and dining Paulson in the White House residence was the Bush team able to \"hammer home its argument that reports of the Treasury Department's diminution were exaggerated\". Exaggerated indeed.</p> <p>And so the man brought in to be a bigger booster for the unsung successes of American capitalism is now responsible for organising a partial nationalisation of American banks. For conservatives, this is a problem. A good portion of them are trying, as they say, to put lipstick on the pig. </p> <p>National Review editor Rich Lowry, after <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTVlMzBiZmE3ZWY1MWY3NjUwZTAzNmM1NGQ1Nzg0Yzk=\">noting</a> obligatorily in his most recent column that \"Euro-bureaucrats have always hated\" American capitalism's \"out-of-control dynamism,\" goes on to make the sporting argument that buying ownership stakes in the country's largest banks \"isn't socialism, but emergency measures to preserve credit, the lifeblood of capitalism\". This is a valiant effort, but if Republicans are going to argue that partial collective ownership of the banking system \u2013 the \"lifeblood of capitalism\", remember! \u2013 isn't socialistic, then they should probably revisit their history of the cold war.</p> <p>Mostly, Republicans are just angry \u2013 especially the up-and-comers. Eve Fairbanks <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/10/05/ST2008100502658.html\">reported</a> in the Washington Post last week that not one of the GOP's freshmen congressmen voted for the bail-out bill when it came up for the original vote last Friday, despite the best efforts of House minority leader John Boehner to control them. Boehner himself referred to the bill as a \"crap sandwich\". Unfortunately for the Republicans, anger isn't a governing philosophy. But it is a recipe for wandering aimlessly in the philosophical desert for the next four years.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to it. And if you think the Republicans have had a coherent governing philosophy for the past eight years then I know somebody with a $700bn reward.</p>",
  "<p>A financially strapped South Korean man went on an arson and stabbing rampage in Seoul on Monday, leaving six people dead with seven others wounded, police said.</p> <p>They said the 31-year-old suspect, identified only by his surname, Jeong, first set fire to his room in a hostel in southern Seoul and went on to stab other residents with a sashimi knife as they fled the fire.</p> <p>Five people were stabbed to death and another died after jumping out of a window to escape the blaze, police said.</p> <p>Seven others were wounded, including four seriously, and the death toll could rise, according to police.</p> <p>The suspect, arrested at the scene, told police he did not want to live because \"everybody looks down on me\", Kim Kap-shik, the chief detective at Seoul's Gangnam police station, told reporters.</p> <p>Police said they seized two more knives and a tear gas gun from Jeong.</p> <p>While Jeong worked part-time at restaurants and other places, he has been out of a job since April.</p> <p>Kim told reporters that the suspect's \"livelihood was difficult and (he) has been under considerable financial pressure\". He could not pay his rent and mobile phone fees for months. </p> <p>Kim added Jeong was facing a police investigation for not taking part in annual training for military reservists.</p> <p>Police said Jeong told them that he had attempted suicide when he was at school, and had been suffering occasionally from severe headaches.</p> <p>Yonhap news agency and other media reported that Jeong had been convicted eight times of various crimes in the past. Police were not immediately available to comment on the reports.</p> <p>One of the dead and four of the injured victims were ethnic Korean Chinese citizens working in South Korea, according to media reports.</p> <p>The hostel was made up of 85 tiny rooms on the third and fourth floors of a commercial building. The rooms are rented on a monthly basis and are generally used by low-income people living alone. Sixty-nine people were living on the premises, Yonhap said.</p> <p>After the blaze started, about 100 firefighters brought the flames under control in half an hour.</p> <p>Such random violence is not common in South Korea, though not unknown.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Rizwan Ahmed (voice, electronics). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Rizwan Ahmed, aka Riz MC, is still only in his early twenties but he has been poised to make a major breakthrough for a while, both as a musician and an actor. As a grime artist, he has underground as well as \"serious\" appeal, hosting club nights and pirate radio shows while being afforded the Emerging Artist in Residence treatment at the South Bank under the patronage of curators Damian Hirst, Johnny Greenwood and Damon Albarn. He also has indie-totem potential, having toured the States with Dan Le Sac vs Scroobius Pip, Laura Marling and Pigeon Detectives. He has supported fellow actor-rapper Mos def and was picked by Massive Attack to support them at this year's Meltdown. <br> His parallel career as an actor is hardly stalling, either. He's about to star in Shifty alongside Jason Flemyng; he played the lead role in the Bafta-winning, controversial Britz, after which the director described his performance \u2013 as a young recruit to the intelligence service M15 \u2013 as \"extraordinary\"; and he earned rave reviews for his role as one of the Tipton Three in Michael Winterbottom's Road to Guantanamo. The latter also earned him some notoriety when, after returning from the Berlin Film Festival, he was briefly detained at Luton airport by Special Branch, who apparently questioned him about his thoughts on the Iraq war.  He's been in hot bother for his music, too: his debut single, Post 9/11 Blues, was banned from daytime radio for its terrorist-and-Menezes-referencing lyric: \"Shave your beard if you're brown/And you best salute the crown/Or they'll do you like Brazilians and shoot your ass down.\" But what is probably giving the authorities some concern is that Ahmed, a second-generation Pakistani and a Muslim, can't easily be dismissed as a semi-literate hoodie from some inner-city hellhole. Far from it: the son of a shipping broker, he grew up in Wembley and gained a scholarship to a private school in Hertfordshire before heading to Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He knows what he's rapping about. And although he's long been involved in London's pirate radio scene, there's more to Riz than urban chatter, ranting and rhyming: he's just as comfortable debating the complexities of 21st-century culture and politics.  Influenced by 80s rapper KRS-One's brand of \"edutainment\" and the sonic experiments of Bj\u00f6rk, 4Hero and Radiohead, Riz addresses contemporary issues without resorting to bland platitudes while his music is lean, menacing electronica. New single Radar, recorded in a tiny studio, is as spare yet striking as the lyrics despairing of information overload while People Like People condemns our obsession with celebrity and desire for conformity. Standard-issue stuff for sure \u2013 Nitin Sawnhey has been operating in similar territory for years \u2013 but he delivers it all with a lyrical concision and musical precision that make you sit up and listen.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"He expertly mixes political satire, social commentary and smart analysis with a mixture of electronica and orchestration.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They love him in the US \u2013 \"his wordplay challenges authority, pisses at conformity, and confronts issues of race and class unlike any rapper in the States\", as one writer raved \u2013 and the South Bank set will love him, but he lacks the dazzling originality of a Dizzee. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Focus on acting \u2013 he's a more original \"voice\" in that world. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Join Special Branch. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Radar is released on November 10 by Crosstown Rebels. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Mos Def, Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Kano. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rizmc\">www.myspace.com/rizmc</a>.<br><strong><br>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Kenan Bell.</p>",
  "<p>The Everglades are drowning.</p> <p>Canals along Alligator Alley have spilled over banks into roadside swales. Deer have been driven from flooded-out tree islands to strips of dry ground - mostly canal levees, but a few have even been spotted on the porches of empty hunting cabins.</p> <p>And the water, already near a record high, is still creeping up - particularly in the area of deepest concern: the sprawling sawgrass prairies north of Tamiami Trail. If the water doesn't recede fast, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns deer and other denizens could die in potentially large numbers.</p> <p>\"If we don't start doing something, we're going to end up with a total massacre,\" said wildlife commissioner Ron Bergeron, who recently took a Democratic US congressman from Florida, Ron Klein, on an airboat trip into the 700,000-acre conservation area west of suburban Miami-Dade and Broward counties, a marsh hammered by high waters over the decades.</p> <p>Similar conditions decimated the Glades' white-tailed deer in 1982 and 1995, knocking the herd from thousands to hundreds, and killed countless smaller animals that rely on high, dry tree islands for food and shelter.</p> <p>Those tree islands are anything but high and dry now.</p> <p>About five miles south of Alligator Alley, Bergeron slowed his airboat near a small tree island, where months earlier he'd spotted a buck. The island used to have a landmark rock outcropping.</p> <p>\"That crop rock shot up 3 to 4 feet there,\" he said. \"It's under water now.\"</p> <p>It's not the water depth - which ought to range from 6 to 18 inches depending on location - that presents the biggest problem; it's duration. With the water up since Tropical Storm Fay seven weeks ago, wildlife managers figure they've got less than 30 days before the toll starts mounting.</p> <p>State and federal water managers, working with an outmoded and overwhelmed flood-control system and sometimes conflicting regulations to protect suburbs, farms, the Glades and the nests of an endangered bird from flooding, say there is not much more they can do - at least until the long-delayed overhaul of the Tamiami Trail and other Everglades projects move forward.</p> <p>\"Right now, we're maximizing all our releases to alleviate the high waters,\" said Andrew Geller, a senior engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p> <p>That's not an answer that sits well with Bergeron, a prominent road builder and self-described \"cracker\" who has spent much of his life fishing and hunting in the Everglades. For weeks, he has been calling state and federal agencies to press for relief - both immediate emergency action and long-term fixes.</p> <p>The worst flooding is north of Tamiami Trail, a historic road that is the dividing line, and major cause, of much of the damage. The road dams up and drowns marshes to the north and dries out Everglades National Park to the south.</p> <p>\"You've got a desert on one side and a reservoir on the other,\" Bergeron said.</p> <p>Bergeron said he aims to be an \"ambassador\" to get the warring factions of the Everglades - environmentalists, the Miccosukee Tribe, local, state and federal agencies - together to break the gridlock surrounding both Tamiami Trail and a small endangered bird called the Cape Sable Seaside sparrow. It's a tall order: The parties have been arguing for a decade.</p> <p>Work to fix the road have been tied up for 19 years. Last month, the National Research Council dubbed the project \"one of the most discouraging stories in Everglades restoration\".</p> <p>The sparrow plan follows a scheme that seasonally closes four huge floodgates along the Trail to protect nesting areas in the park from floods - and as a result stacks water to the north.</p> <p>The Corps hopes to break ground before year's end on a one-mile bridge, and a pilot project to improve flow through 19 existing culverts by scraping out a narrow strip of wetlands south of the road. Bergeron supports expanding that project, an option environmental groups haven't embraced.</p> <p>He also wants federal wildlife managers to reconsider the sparrow plan and broaden protections for animals harmed by the flooding, such as the endangered Florida panther.</p> <p>His complaints echoed those of the Miccosukee, who have long argued that high waters destroy tribal lands - 250 acres of tree islands vanish yearly - and decimate other animals, including the endangered Everglades kite.</p> <p>\"I understand his frustration,\" said tribe spokeswoman Joette Lorion. \"This area of the Everglades is being trashed, and nobody cares.\"</p> <p>Paul Souza, field supervisor for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which oversees the sparrow plan, understands the concerns and said the agency has been \"thinking through\" options in light of studies documenting the freefall of the kite, which has declined by two-thirds since 2000.</p> <p>Souza agreed that starting work on the Trail was the most promising relief valve.</p> <p>\"It's not the full answer, but it is a step in the right direction,\" he said.</p> <p>For now, state wildlife managers are trying to minimize stress on wildlife. Though anglers can still ply canals, the FWC closed hunting and most public access to the interior marsh after Fay's 20 inches of rain officially ended South Florida two-year drought. More storms since have pushed water higher.</p> <p>At one island, Bergeron, machete in hand, led Klein onto what he said was the highest spot for miles. Most of it was inundated. The driest spot was muddy.</p> <p>The longer the marshes remain too deep, the lower the odds of wildlife survival.</p> <p>Animals packed on levees are more prone to disease and can be easier picking for predators. Stragglers left in the belly-deep marsh face even higher risks such as hoof rot - perhaps the unfortunate fate of one startled deer that left a splashing trail as it bolted at the roar of airboats. It was miles from dry footing.</p> <p>\"If there is no place it can get to high ground,\" said FWC regional director Chuck Collins, \"it's a goner\".</p>",
  "<p>Iran is to continue with the death penalty for juveniles convicted of murder despite moving to end the practice for those found guilty of lesser offences.</p> <p>The Iranian deputy state prosecutor, Hossein Zabhi, said it remained necessary to execute those who had committed murder before reaching the age of 18 under the country's Islamic laws.</p> <p>The legislation demands an \"eye for an eye\", as defined in the Qur'an.</p> <p>Zabhi's comments greatly dilute the effects of a state directive, issued last week, which instructed judges to curtail the use of capital punishment for those who had committed crimes as children.</p> <p>The directive was hailed by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as a major step forward in Iran's attitude towards child executions.</p> <p>Both organisations had voiced hopes that the decision, taken by the Iranian judiciary chief, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, would save around 120 teenagers currently awaiting execution.</p> <p>Iranian law carries the death penalty for several offences, including drug trafficking, apostasy and rape.</p> <p>Human rights lawyers say the vast majority of minors on death row have murder convictions and would be unaffected by the change. </p> <p>\"The new directive bans execution of criminals who are under 18 only if they have committed crimes related to narcotics that carry death penalty,\" Zabhi told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"We can't deny a victim's family the legal right to ask for Islamic qesas ... eye for eye retribution.\"</p> <p>He added that those convicted of serious drug offences would be given life sentences with the possibility of parole for good behaviour.</p> <p>However, Mohammad Mostafai, a lawyer who has represented many juvenile defendants, said the number of people reprieved would be in single figures, dismissing the directive as an attempt to ease international pressure.</p>",

It should take around 30-40 minutes in all.</p> <p>On the other hand, if anyone <em>is</em> having trouble, Allegra will be cooking the meal along with us, providing the recipe instructions, line by line in real time, on the blog so you can shout questions in the comments bit. </p> <p>So here are the ingredients for our living recipe - it's in two parts to prevent confusion (no prizes for the first person to guess the recipe). Post any questions about prep/substitutes now and I'll consult with Allegra and get back to you before Wednesday. I'll be asking some of our experts for wine suggestions to go with it and early next week we'll have pictures of each stage of the recipe to further whet your appetite. Make sure you have a camera to capture your own experience (Flickr users can tag pictures \"living recipe\" and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/wordofmouth/\">send them to our group</a>) and we'll assemble the lot to see how we all went.</p> <blockquote> <p><br><strong>Ingredients for our living recipe</strong> <br>Serves four</p> <p>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil <br>1 aubergine<br>1 onion, sliced<br>2 cloves garlic, chopped<br>1 big green chilli<br>1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>Half teaspoon ground coriander<br>1 teaspoon turmeric<br>1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds<br>1 x 400g tin chopped plum tomatoes<br>1 large green pepper, cut into bite size pieces<br>30g fructose (or you can use sugar or honey - amounts tbc)<br>1 heaped tablespoon tamarind paste (or use tamardind block, amounts tbc)<br>150g dried fava beans (soaked overnight - reserve the water) OR a tin of chickpeas<br>300g tomatoes, cut into eighths<br>a small handful of mint, roughly chopped<br>salt and pepper<br>Greek yoghurt</p> <p>2 tablespoons currants<br>Half a teaspoon ground allspice<br>1 heaped teaspoon chopped dill<br>1 large spring onion, sliced<br>One and a half tablespoon extra virgin olive oil<br>250g brown basmati rice<br>500 ml vegetable stock<br>salt</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm bound to have forgotten to tell you something crucial. Any questions for now?</p> <p><strong>JUST IN! Allegra's keen to offer some alternative ingredients in case people are having trouble sourcing them. So if you can't easily get fructose, you'll be fine with sugar or honey - we'll let you know the adjusted measurements in due course. And for tamarind paste, tamarind block will do just as well. Get some Greek yoghurt in too, she says. </strong></p>",

The Californian looks a sure bet to claim his third consecutive Cup after recording his 39th career victory in dominant style, leading 339 of the 504 laps. Johnson easily fended off an early challenge from team-mate Jeff Gordon and eventually led home Dale Earnhardt Jr, who never got close enough to challenge the Chevrolet man, and Carl Edwards.</p> <p>\"I'm very proud of the effort we put up today,\" said Johnson. \"We had a car that could lead a lot of laps, one of probably the top two or three cars all day long. The stops were on the money, the car was great, I did my part and Chad [Knaus, crew chief] had a great strategy.\"</p> <p>The reigning champion has now won five times at the Martinsville Speedway. \"I typically do better at quirky tracks, tracks that need some type of technique,\" he said. \"If it's a rough track and an abrasive track, whatever it may be, those tracks really fall into my style, and I think it's due to my off-road racing background.\"</p> <p>Johnson's lead over Greg Biffle \u2014 who finished the race in 12th position \u2014 is now 149 points with four races left. But Hendrick Motorsports' Johnson said he would not become complacent. \"As long as I can stay scared and on my heels and worried about losing this thing, the better this team is going to be.

  "<h2>Dark Materials</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman\">Philip Pullman</a>'s His Dark Materials (1995-2000) comprises three big books that explore a fantastic parallel world. Nothing new there - these tomes can be placed alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien\">JRR Tolkien</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/cslewis\">CS Lewis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling\">JK Rowling</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter\">Harry Potter franchise</a>. Weirdly, all these <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books\">books</a> were made into big <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">films</a> at the beginning of the twenty-first century.</p> <p>Obviously, this coincidence may be explained by the tendency of big money to go towards generic product in the film industry. The global success of one film immediately sets producers looking for something similar; and thus a genre is born. The advent of computer-generated special effects also played a key role in facilitating the plausible creation of lavish fantasy worlds.</p> <p>In America the first of the books was called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121987/golden.compass\">The Golden Compass</a>. British readers may be more familiar with the title Northern Lights. The film version of the first book took its name from the American publication.</p> <p>The books and films also tapped into a widespread millennial anxiety about the real value of life, work and everything in between. These millennial musings were prompted by mounting evidence of ecological disaster, economic decadence and social inequality. With hindsight this kind of cultural production acts as a powerful indicator of hell-in-a-handcart social debauch. No one can say that we weren't warned.</p> <p>Pullman is drawing on a tradition of romantic fatalism that questions the role and value of rationalism in human affairs. Historically, this has generally been understood as a criticism of science and technology and, at the same time, as an appeal for a return to a more authentic, or real, emotional intelligence. Famously, these themes were explored in the romantic horror story Frankenstein.</p> <p>One of the most appealing aspects of Pullman's trilogy is the special type of technology that underpins each of the stories. In Northern Lights, Pullman introduces the alethiometer. This is a dialled instrument that provides answers to various questions \u2013 a sort of portable oracle. The instrument can only be used by the gifted and the answers it gives are usually obscure.</p> <p>In later books, Pullman introduces the Subtle Knife, which cuts between time and space and, finally, the Amber Spy Glass.</p> <p>In the film the alethiometer is visualised as an instrument from the beginning of the scientific revolution. The emotional and interpretive aspects of the machine connect to a shamanistic and pre-scientific understanding of the world and its meanings.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the book there are narrow boats, blimps and devilish mechanical insects. This world is not some simple throw-back to a Luddite pre-industrial arcadia: it is an alternative scientific and industrial world.</p> <p>In the poster this technological historicism is shown through the combination of balloon flying machine and wild-west style armament. This combination is not actually as unusual as it seems. It's a well-established genre in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror\">fantasy fiction</a> known as steampunk.</p> <h2>Steampunk</h2> <p>The genre emerged during the second half of the 1980s. It began as science-fiction writers rediscovered the pioneers of the genre: Jules Verne and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells\">HG Wells</a>.</p> <p>Jules Verne had already explored, in the light-hearted story Around the World in Eighty Days, the idea of a technologically enabled world constructed from a multitude of separate, but interconnected, parts. For Phileas Fogg the world could be circumnavigated through train timetables and shipping schedules. Verne was writing in the 1870s when relatively few people had this understanding of the world as an elaborately mechanistic system.</p> <p>The steampunk genre evolved to explore a society where Victorian engineering and industrial organisation had developed in sophistication without reaching the solid-state electronics of the 20th century. The genre was predicated, in some way, on the success of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p> <p>The Analytical Engine was conceptualised as the first programmable computer. It was the second of Babbage's great calculating engines. For reasons of money and personality, the first machine remained largely unrealised. The second engine remains one of the great might-have-beens of the Victorian age.</p> <p>For steampunks, the Babbage machines are part of a mechanical organisation of society. This organisation extends beyond the material culture of Victorian Britain and to the conceptual framework of society. The sociology of steampunk devolves from Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham, as much as from Babbage. The atomisation implicit in the specialisation of labour is extended by the development of Bentham's panoptic vision to become an organising principle of social control.</p> <p>The successful development of Babbage's machines would have allowed for data processing, implicit in panoptic control, to be carried out successfully. So, discipline and control are the forces against which the protagonists of steampunk battle.</p> <p>In steampunk worlds, this struggle is played out against a backdrop of brass-bound mahogany and polished brass, club chairs, steam railways and blimps. The nostalgic luxury of these things distinguishes this particular dystopia from its variants in Nineteen Eighty-Four, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76627/blade.runner\">Blade Runner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92062/minority.report\">Minority Report</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77528/matrix\">The Matrix</a>.</p> <p>Of course for Pullman, the panoptic control of The Golden Compass, goes far beyond the material conditions of everyday life. In the film, control is enforced through the devilish personality of Mrs Coulter, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman\">Nicole Kidman</a>. Mrs Coulter works for the General Oblation Board who are experimentalists working for the Magisterium. They marshal resources and mobilise force, through secret knowledge, to exercise their political will to power.</p>",
  "<p>I was headed into my local grocer in Durham, <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/nchome\">North Carolina</a> last weekend when I saw a startling sight. A pickup truck of early 1990s era was in the carpark, and scrawled across the side of it in big, carefully-lettered permanent marker were the words \"Southern White Hard-Working Beer-Drinking Gun-Owning White Man In His 50s FOR OBAMA!\", with the last two words <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/16/race-wedge-issues-fall-fl_n_135245.html\">drawn about eighteen inches high</a>.</p> <p>Now, it isn't uncommon for a man to deface his beloved pickup truck in the South, especially when he is passionate about a cause. This isn't to say that we don't revere the iconic pick-up truck much the way that some nomads revere horses or camels. It's as much an economic issue as anything \u2013 a man with a pick-up truck won't starve, ever. But as such, most truck-owning Southerners treat their vehicles like prized thoroughbreds \u2013 it takes a lot to bring a man to voluntarily deface it. When it does happen, it is a bold and powerful statement to the community.</p> <p>Usually a Nascar racing team is involved, or a local government agency who he feels has targeted him unfairly. Ex-wives frequently crop up on the sides of trucks \u2013 as do their lawyers \u2013 and especially after September 11, global Islamic terrorists and our war-weary troops have been the favourite subjects. And religious verse and iconography are not infrequent, either. Pickup trucks in the South are a kind of rolling marginalia, an eight-cylinder object d'art, a practical exercise of free speech on big tires.</p> <p>So when a Southern white man defaces his white truck in the name of an African American candidate for office \u2013 favourably \u2013 that is indeed worthy of note by us casual \"pickup truck spotters\".</p> <p>Admittedly, we are in a solidly-Democratic city with a large African-American population, with one of the <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/\">most liberal private universities in the nation</a> and the South's second highest lesbian population. If you travel 50 miles in any direction from Durham, you emerge into the \"real\" rural South, famed in song, story and film for its quaint cultural attitudes, casual violence, extreme politeness and devout religious piety. And, of course, its racial insecurity.</p> <p>Race intrudes in just about every aspect of life in the American south that it becomes part of the atmosphere, like the water in a fishtank. I didn't really understand that myself until I traveled beyond the South and realized the difference. Once upon a time it would have been nigh unthinkable for a white man, no matter how liberal, to voice support for an African-American political candidate - period. After 30 years of consistent jabbing at the old Southern social order, such things are more common today. The \"Age of Obama\" has helped shake up the last vestiges of the old regime, however, and as we approach Election Day it's easy to see how the casual racism that used to be so overt in Dixie can be so easily exhumed.</p> <p>The danger to the Obama campaign in the South has always been racial in nature \u2013 and his campaign has done its best to distance itself from the traditional southern African American political machines (which are just as corrupt and effective as the white Republican political machines) while still energizing the base they represent. It's been a delicate dance, and one made harder by his middle name and African heritage. Militant \"Black Muslims\" have always been a boogey-man to ignorant white voters in the South, and damning Obama by implication is second nature to his opponents here. They nearly salivated over the inflammatory Jeremiah Wright video, figuring it was an open-and-shut condemnation that would keep the region safely red this year.</p> <p>Not so fast.</p> <p>The race card has been continuously played here for 200 years, now, and used to effect political change, usually by wealthy white people. It has led to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_Insurrection_of_1898\">only successful coup d'etat in American history</a>, the deaths of thousands by lynching, the disenfranchisement of a good 20% of the population, and a racially-based caste system that took decades to overthrow. Today it leaves behind a residue that is all-too-apparent in this presidential race.</p> <p>Sometimes it's blatant. \"You're just supporting Obama because of white guilt,\" one woman of my parents' generation accuses me. \"They are trying to make you feel bad because of slavery!\" she whines. She's voted Democratic in every election I've voted in, but she's suddenly become a conservative Republican, now that McCain is facing a black man. My protests about the race-neutral issue of a trillion dollars spent on our foreign wars meaning more to me than four centuries of racial injustice fall on deaf ears. To her, the only reason a sane white Southerner would ever support an African American for president is because of racial guilt.</p> <p>Sometimes it's slightly more subtle. Another lady from my church, one I privately called \"the Right Arm Of God\" - not because of her observed piety, I should probably point out, but for her excessive zeal in protecting her daughter's virtue - is upset that I've been vocal in support of Obama in public where people can see. \"I hope you'll use that intellect to get the right man elected,\" she cautions me. I don't need to be a genius to figure out what she means.</p> <p>But sometimes you find relief from the ignorance in unexpected places. Like when my brother-in-law, a deputy sheriff, epitome of Southern conservative power, pulled into my driveway and nodded to my Obama sticker. \"I'm gonna vote for that sumb*tch,\" he expressed, colourfully. \"Looks like McCain's gonna be another term for George Bush, and I'd rather vote for a damn Muslim negro than that.\" And no, he didn't use the word \"negro\". It was the same day I saw that pick-up truck with the proud pro-Obama message.</p> <p>Baby steps.</p>",
  "<p>Time and again, parents tell us what they want for their children is a good local school they do not have to travel far to.</p> <p>We hear stories of families just trying to get the best for their children.</p> <p>Close proximity means children can participate in extra-curricular and social activities, enhancing their experience. </p> <p>Parents also want a school that suits their child's individual needs, be they academic or pastoral, of faith, disability, or gender. There is no 'one size fits all' school; a 'good' school is a school that can meet the needs of the individual child.</p> <p>Here at the Advisory Centre for Education (ACE), we sometimes feel like we're living in a parallel universe. </p> <p>We take in reports on the school admissions and appeals process, but they do not reflect the stories that we hear from parents and carers on our advice lines. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the perpetuation of the myth of choice, and an increasing number of schools with control over their own admissions policy, leads to a more complicated system for parents. </p> <p>Since 2008, school admissions and appeals codes have tried to set up a fairer, more transparent system. The government is trying to satisfy need, but whatever system you have, there will be winners and losers. </p> <p>Those who get the school place they want will think the system works. Those who don't, understandably, blame the system.</p> <p>As part of my role I train local authority and school staff, appeal panel members and clerks. I have sat as a clerk for hundreds of appeals. I am also the mother of two boys, now safely ensconced in secondary school. So I speak as someone who has experienced the admissions process from both ends of the advice line. <br> School admission is not a fiefdom of middle class parents with bright children. </p> <p>It is an issue for looked after children. It impacts on parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities who are desperately trying to find appropriate educational provision. </p> <p>It is a struggle for homeless or refugee families who must negotiate the system on top of all the other adaptations they have to make to family life. </p> <p>Service personnel, recently returned to the country, and looking for housing and schools for their families, are challenged by the process. </p> <h2>What parents should do</h2> <p>Firstly, remember that despite everything that is said about 'choice', you do NOT have a right to choose a school for your child. </p> <p>You do however have a right to state your preference for the school you would like your child to attend, and to give your reasons for this stated preference. </p> <p>If there are more people applying for the school than there are places and if other applicants meet the school's published over-subscription criteria more closely than your child does, your application can be refused.<br> Secondly, make sure that you get all the information you need, both at the time of applying for a school place and, if it comes to it, when appealing. Most importantly, visit schools, if possible while children are attending to see what the learning environment is like. Are all children included? Is there a positive atmosphere? Look at the league tables and Ofsted reports \u2013 but remember that these will not tell you the whole picture. </p> <p>Speak to other parents, children and teachers. Most primary schools will arrange meetings to help parents make their decisions around secondary transfer time. The internet is a mine of information, but always be aware that some information and advice may not be accurate, however well-intentioned it is.<br> Thirdly, think about your child's strengths and any potential problem areas they may have. Look at all the possible schools. Where will their strengths be encouraged and their needs be best met? Next, look at the school's admission arrangements and over-subscription criteria. These must be clear, fair, and objective. They must be published in a booklet produced by the local authority where the school is located and provided to you for free. They are usually also available on the local authority website. See how well your child meets these criteria. If she or he does not meet them well, you may be wasting a preference.  Finally, state your preferences and give all your reasons for wanting the particular schools. Remember to submit your application in time. This is very important as late applications may be considered after on time applications and the school may then already be full. </p> <p>If you have any doubts, speak to your local authority admissions section or for secondary transfer, your primary school. Free help and advice is also available from choice advisers and independent charities, such as ACE.<br> And when you've done all of that, get on with the business of living with and enjoying life with your children. \u2022 Ingrid Sutherland is an education consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.ace-ed.org.uk\">Advisory Centre for Education</a> (ACE)</p>",
  "<p>\"What other culture could have produced someone like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/ernesthemingway\">Ernest Hemingway</a>,\" waspish, bisexual American exile Gore Vidal once asked of America's favourite so-butch-he's-camp writer, \"and not seen the joke?\" The answer, of course, was that only a culture that couldn't see the joke could produce a Hemingway.</p> <p>I don't know whether Matt Lucas and David Walliams read Vidal or Hemingway, but in Little Britain USA, the HBO spin-off of the hit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy\">comedy</a> sketch series (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/05/bbc.television1\">which is also airing on BBC1</a>), they seem to be posing that question again \u2013 though this time the answer has some bearing on the likelihood of stateside success. In Little Britain USA, \"Our Boys\" (as a cheerleading UK media seem to have tagged the camp duo) have put their probing finger on one of the most ticklish fault lines of US culture: how \"gay\" big butch God-fearing America can seem \u2013 and how comically in denial of this Americans can be.</p> <p>There certainly seems to be a bit of Hemingway, who loved his guns, in the mustachioed cop (played by Walliams) who gets a visible hard-on while demonstrating his impressive collection of weapons to fellow officers. But it's with steroid-scary, towel-snapping <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q4VFoAvUSI\">Gym Buddies Tom and Mark</a>, who like to take long showers together after pumping iron, graphically re-enacting what they did to the 'pussy' they pulled last night, that Little Britain USA outs the so-butch-it's-camp not-so-hidden secret of American culture. Along with pathological denial.</p> <p>In last week's episode, when an alarmed bystander glances nervously at the Buddies humping naked in the locker room, they retort: \"Whaddyou lookin at? Are you A FAG??\" Walliams, who is so camp he's almost butch (a ladies' man off-screen, he has been described repeatedly by the UK press as \"the ultimate metrosexual\"), seems especially proud of the sketch, describing it as \"possibly the most outrageous we've ever done\". Certainly it's drawn most fire from critics in the US, who have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/13/do1302.xml\">given the series very mixed reviews</a>.</p> <p>Lucas and Walliams' gleefully amoral queer sensibility - they're basically drag queens on a revenge trip, especially when they dress up as men - was always going to be difficult for America to swallow. But touching up Uncle Sam in the locker room may well make it a lot harder \u2026 er, I mean, more difficult. America, even the part that watches HBO, may not want to get the joke. Especially when made by a couple of faggy Brits. And by the way, while we might think American butchness tr\u00e8s gay (the volley ball scenes in Top Gun), all Europeans look \"faggy\" to Americans - especially us Brits. The sketch featuring Walliams as a flaming Brit prime minister trying to get into the straight black US president's pants probably won't offend as much as Walliams hopes since most Americans thought Tony Blair was gay anyway.</p> <p>Rather sweetly, compared to the UK, America is a country where machismo is still sacred - despite having done more than any other country to make it obsolete by inventing men's shopping magazines. In the US of A, it seems, anything masculine can't be gay and vice versa. Hence Tom and Mark. Hence <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/23/usa.gayrights\">\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\"</a>. And hence all that fuss the US made over that mediocre gay cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain, which bored everyone senseless when it arrived in the UK.</p> <p>America's love of the masculine body is gloriously \"gay\" - or, more accurately, homoerotic. But alas, until now Uncle Sam has been ashamed of his natural, red-blooded and blatantly bloody obvious bi-responsiveness.</p> <p>Only America, God Bless, could have produced UFC, a hugely popular pay-per-view \"full-contact sport\" that involves two young, muscled men in shorts trying to get each other's legs around their ears (Tom and Mark probably watch it together). Only America could produce a bestselling men's workout magazine like Men's Health, put men's pumped tits and abs on the cover and strenuously maintain that none of its readers are gay or bisexual - <a href=\"http://www.marksimpson.com/blog/2007/05/18/mens-lifestyle-mags-%E2%80%93-how-gay-are-they/\">or even metrosexual</a>. Only America could produce a film like last year's 300, essentially a toga-themed Chippendale flick for teen boys. </p> <p>Mind you, 300 had at least one virtue, albeit unintentional: it was amusing. Perhaps the biggest problem Walliams and Lucas face in ramming their sensibility down Uncle Sam's throat isn't America's gagging reluctance to see the camp joke, but that on the basis of the first couple of shows, their American \"outing\" <em>just isn't very funny</em>.</p> <p>Either side of the pond.</p>",
  "<p>From a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/Politics/story?id=6067150\">WashPost-ABC poll</a> just released this morning:</p> <blockquote> <p>Skepticism about the Ayers issue was one of the factors cited by Colin Powell in his endorsement of Obama yesterday, and in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, likely voters broadly agree: 60 percent say Obama's relationship with Ayers is not a legitimate issue in the presidential campaign; 37 percent say it is. </p> </blockquote> <p>Rule of thumb: Whenever you see in a poll that something around 35% of people take a position, you know that that position is agreed to only by pretty hard-core ideologues. Actually, in the case of liberals it would be somewhat lower. Generally speaking in polling over the last few years, about 20-24% of Americans say they're liberal, 34-38% conservative, the rest in the middle. </p> <p>So this 37% figure means only conservatives really think of Ayers as a legit issue. </p> <p>To the extent that it's possible as you look at polls over the next two weeks, see if they're broken down by Democrat-Republican-independent. Check whether the indies are close to the D's or R's. That'll tell you something about how swing voters will probably move.<br></p>",
  "<p>A weekend of good news for the Obama campaign reached its high point yesterday in the endorsement of Colin Powell, George Bush's former secretary of state, who used a Sunday morning talkshow to heap praise on a man he called a \"transformational figure\", saying America needed a \"generational change\". Courteously phrased though it was, Powell's endorsement represented a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign, Dan Glaister writes in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Guardian</a>: the four-star general specifically criticised his fellow Republican's focus on Bill Ayers, and the spate of fiercely negative anti-Obama \"robocalls\" reported around the country. (\"Mr McCain says that he's a washed-out terrorist,\" Powell said. \"Well, then, why do we keep talking about him?\") The McCain campaign, wisely, responded by attacking Obama rather than Powell. \"Only an unproven and inexperienced politician like Barack Obama would have to rely so heavily on an another man's resume in making the case for his own candidacy,\" said spokesman Tucker Bounds, \"and it shows that he's just not ready.\"</p> <p>Powell's backing means much because of his military and foreign-policy credentials, of course, and his prior service in a Republican administration. Perhaps even more importantly, though, it gave the Obama campaign an adrenaline shot - and a set of fresh positive headlines - at a time when the greatest danger it faces may be a loss of energy amid sustained poll leads. That was also true of yesterday's news that the Obama campaign had raised a record-breaking $150m in September, far exceeding his previous record of $65m in August. Meanwhile, on Saturday, Obama attracted the largest crowd of the campaign, when an estimated 100,000 people attended a rally in Missouri. As we enter the last two full weeks before the election, Obama's momentum is apparently unflagging. How will McCain - who likes stunts and surprises, as you may have noticed - choose to respond?</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Florida and Colorado; McCain is in Missouri; Sarah Palin is in Colorado. (Joe Biden has no events scheduled.) Along with more reaction to the Powell endorsement, expect further vociferous debate over the Republican \"robocalls\"; they're now drawing criticism from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/obama-mccain-election-ohio-carolina\">across the political spectrum</a>, with many noting they were exactly the tactics used by George Bush to help sink McCain's presidential campaign in 2000.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>In the first tracking polls based solely on data collected after the final debate, Obama's lead remains essentially steady. The latest results of the Gallup daily tracking poll are Obama 51%, McCain 44% among likely voters (though among \"traditional likely voters\", a measure that factors in participation in past elections, the margin is only 49%-46%). Rasmussen's poll of likely voters is at 51%-45%. An ABC News/Washington Post poll over the weekend found that 36% of likely voters had a better opinion of Obama after the debates, compared to 12% who had a worse one; McCain left 26% thinking less of him and 20% thinking more highly.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>In an interesting moment on Fox News Sunday, McCain is asked whether he could live with losing the election, and chooses not to dodge the question: \"Oh, sure ... I've got a wonderful life. I have to go back and live in Arizona and be in the United States Senate representing them, and with a wonderful family, and daughters and sons that I'm so proud of, and a life that's been blessed.\"</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-barackobama\">Video: 'Obama is a liar' - gun owners sound off</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Michael Tomasky: A friendly nod from a familiar face</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/20/us-elections-get-out-the-vote-rally\">Video: 'Our generation will have to pay for the war and the bail-out'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/poll/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-obama-poll\">Poll: Does Colin Powell's endorsement help Barack Obama?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-barackobama\">Charlie Brooker: CNN's voter approval graph turned the presidential debate into a computer game.

  "<p>Fans stared into space, stunned, shaking their heads in silent surrender. Iker Casillas booted the ball skywards, had another go at the lad who'd hurriedly pressed it into his unwelcome hands like a <em>sevillana</em> with a sprig of lucky heather and let out a roar. Meanwhile, the Son in Law of God pulled at his shorts, bit his lip and mentally eeny-meeny-miney-mo'ed between Milan and Manchester. Down the Calder\u00f3n stairs, cunningly carpeted to conceal the crumbling concrete below, and into the bogs the post mortem began. Paddling through the piss, they were asking the same question: how the hell did that happen? The answer was obvious: it's the derby, stupid. And we're Atl\u00e9tico.</p> <p>That's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/atleticomadrid\">Club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid</a>, the team that just can't help themselves from not so much falling on their sword as taking a running jump off a cliff and plummeting 100ft on to its glistening blade. <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/05/12/aguero_leads_atletico_back_to.html\">They might have finally made it into the Champions League</a>, but when it comes to playing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid\">Real Madrid</a> there's no escaping their fate. Every year, they tell themselves that this time more than any other time they're going to find a way to beat Madrid. And some years you even believe them. Every year what they actually find is another way to lose, more convoluted and cruel than before. Another improbable twist. Normally of the knife.</p> <p>This year was no different. Saturday, 10.30pm at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n and Javier Aguirre shrugged sadly, the knife twisted in his side, a whole set of them poised to stab him in the back. \"Football,\" he said, \"can be cruel.\" And this latest derby \u2014 attended by the government minister who admitted \"Madrid make me sick\", the Frente Atl\u00e9tico ultras who unfurled a banner saying \"Jorg Haider RIP\", and <em>not</em> the columnist who insisted fans proved \"Platini and his little friends wrong\" \u2014 was perhaps the cruellest yet.</p> <p>You see, just five minutes before Casillas booted a celebratory ball into the air, he had booted his post in disgust, worn his Iker Casillas face \u2014 the one that says, \"you call <em>that</em> a defence?!\" \u2014 and defecated on Gonzalo Higua\u00edn's prostitute mother. As he looked across, Atl\u00e9tico's players were leaping into the crowd in delight; as he looked up at the stadium clock, it showed 90 minutes. And 1-1. It might not have been a win, but to the Calder\u00f3n it felt like one. Down to 10 men and a goal behind, Atl\u00e9tico had fought back, led by a shattered yet superb Aguero. And just when it looked like they'd suffer a familiar fate, Simao Sabrosa curled in a free-kick. It was a fantastic end to a mad game that had it all \u2014 one injured ref, two red cards and three disallowed goals. At long, long last, Atl\u00e9tico had ended a derby in delight not despair.</p> <p>Only it wasn't and they hadn't. Because if Ruud van Nistelrooy had brilliantly scored Madrid's first 34 seconds after the opening whistle, Higua\u00edn was about to get another barely 34 seconds before the final whistle. Substitute Royston Drenthe tumbled, Carlos Clos Gom\u00e9z pointed to the spot, and Higua\u00edn wrestled the ball off Rafael van der Vaart. The roar of \"Atleeeeeeeti\", replacing a helpful reminder that Spain won the European Championships without Ra\u00fal, died in <em>atl\u00e9tico</em> throats. Higua\u00edn thumped in the penalty. The clock showed 96 minutes. \"That's the way to win a derby!\" screamed AS. Atl\u00e9tico fans crumpled, hopes destroyed. Normal service was resumed. \"Life,\" insisted Marca, \"remains the same.\" \"It was,\" AS added, \"the same result as always.\"</p> <p>Whatever route Atl\u00e9tico take, they seem to end in the same place: depression. They've been beaten by good Madrid sides and rubbish ones; conceded after 14 seconds; battered their opponents only for an unwanted porker <a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/continentalfootball/story/0,,2021896,00.html\">and a striker who'd never scored to snatch victory away</a>; <a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/continentalfootball/story/0,,1885859,00.html\">missed last minute sitters</a>; and even overcome adversity only to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jan/21/europeanfootball.realmadrid1\">crushed by the fist of fate</a>. They've blamed it on the sunshine, the moonlight, the good times <em>and</em> the boogie. Mostly, they've blamed it on the ref even when it hasn't been his fault. They've been rubbish and robbed, good, bad and ugly. What they've never been of late is victorious.</p> <p>In fact, it will now be a decade since Atl\u00e9tico have beaten Real at the Calder\u00f3n. They've not won anywhere in 14 derbies. Only once since they returned to the First Division have they even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2003/jan/20/europeanfootball.sport1\">ended one feeling pleased</a> \u2014 and even that was tinged with regret after a performance in which AS's mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero gleefully pointed out that \"despite being sacked and violated, Atl\u00e9ti failed to crush us.\" \"The 600,000 children born in the capital in the last 3,409 days have only read one story: this one,\" gloated the rabid Real fan this weekend, \"that's why 95% have become faithful to the religion professed in the Bernab\u00e9u temple.\"</p> <p>If that sounded suspiciously like Roncero was making up his figures \u2014 and as if kids capital-wide have been cruelly denied access to Billy Blue Hat, Balooky Klujypop, and even Topsy and Tim \u2014 he was right, and there was something strangely probable about Atl\u00e9tico's improbable defeat. \"Typical\", \"inevitable\", \"classic\" muttered the men in the men's room, while AS's resident <em>atl\u00e9tico</em> Manolete spat: \"this is impossible. The jinx is endemic \u2014 I'm throwing in the towel.\" A man sent off, a last-minute penalty, a dodgy ref, and a painful defeat: they'd been cheated again.</p> <p>Except they hadn't. Madrid too had a player sent off \u2014 and not only was Madrid's red harsh and Atl\u00e9ti's justified, but anyone would happily swap Luis Perea for Van Nistelrooy. Madrid dominated until Ruud's red, the three disallowed goals were all Madrid's, the best chances fell their way, Wesley Sneijder hit the bar, and the penalty was right. Coach Bernd Schuster insisted that but for the ref Madrid would in fact have won 5-1. Now, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/05/saturday_nights_all_right_for.html\">Madrid's coach has been wrong before</a>, but this time you couldn't accuse him of bias, or refusing to see the other side. \"Hang on a minute,\" insisted one interrogator, \"Atl\u00e9tico had loads of chances in the second half.\" To which Schuster stroked his moustache and nodded. \"You're right,\" he conceded. \"Five-<em>two</em>, then.\"</p> <p><strong>Results</strong><br>Espanyol 0\u20130 Villarreal; Atl\u00e9tico 1\u20132 Real Madrid; Valencia 4\u20130 Numancia; Racing 0\u20130 Deportivo; Sporting 2\u20131 Osasuna; Betis 3\u20130 Mallorca; Athletic 0\u20131 Barcelona; Almer\u00eda 0\u20131 Sevilla; M\u00e1laga 2\u20131 Getafe; Valladolid 1\u20131 Recreativo<br><a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29\"><br>Latest La Liga table</a></p>",
  "<p>A recycling bin full of empty <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugsandalcohol\">alcohol</a> bottles may be a sign you are drinking too much, a UK charity warned today.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.drinkaware.co.uk\">Drinkaware Trust's</a> new \u00a31m poster campaign shows a recycling bin overflowing with bottles with the slogan \"Big party at the weekend?\" and a bottle bank with the message \"Do you come here often?\" </p> <p>The charity said people who drink more than the recommended limits at home are a \"forgotten group\" as most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">health</a> campaigns target young people. </p> <p>Older drinkers are more likely to be settled with children, but their drinking can slide out of control.</p> <p>\"Drinking in the home can lull us into a false sense of security because we simply fail to take note of the amount we consume,\" said its chairman, Derek Lewis. </p> <p>\"Many people are unwittingly at risk from the long-term health problems associated with drinking too much alcohol.</p> <p>\"With this campaign, we're encouraging everyone to use the evidence of the cans and bottles in their recycling bins to gauge whether or not they're overdoing it.\" </p> <p>The campaign comes after a new poll found Britons drink at home more often than in pubs, bars and restaurants. </p> <p>Drinkaware's Urban Life survey of 4,400 people found they drank alcohol at home nearly twice a week, compared with an average 1.5 times at a pub, bar or restaurant.</p> <p>One in six people also worried about the amount they drank, based on the contents of their recycling bin. </p> <p>Drinkaware said many home drinkers were not drinking heavily, but needed to monitor their consumption.</p> <p>\"The trust is not suggesting people give up alcohol. Alcohol does have a very positive part to play: it helps people to relax, it's an important part of our social life,\" Lewis said. </p> <p>\"It can be part of your 'most days' lifestyle without creating risks, providing you manage your consumption.\" </p> <p>The Drinkaware posters will be displayed in stations, on buses and around cities in the UK.</p> <p>One in four British adults drink at levels which put their health at risk, the charity said.</p> <p>The government is considering compulsory health warnings on display wherever alcohol is sold, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/13/drugsandalcohol-health\">curb on free drink promotions</a>, to cut health and social problems related to drunknenness.</p> <p>The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said people need to check how many units they consume.</p> <p>\"Alcohol is an ever-growing public health concern, with excess alcohol consumption increasing the risk of diseases such as hypertension, stroke and of course liver cirrhosis,\" he added. </p> <p>The Drinkaware survey, carried out last month, follows a poll by the charity in June which found 81% of people did not know the daily alcohol unit guidelines. </p> <p>The government recommend drinking no more than 2-3 units a day for women and 3-4 units a day for men.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, in an article about what David Cameron and his circle were thinking about the political consequences of the global financial crisis, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2008/10/tories-prepare.html\">ConservativeHome</a> reported: \"The Tories are not worried about being largely out of the news.\"</p> <p>I think we can safely discount that theory.<br><br>On Friday Cameron delivered a big, headline-grabbing speech. Yesterday the Tories announced plans for a VAT holiday. Today they're calling for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/20/davidcameron-conservatives\">a tax cut for small businesses</a>. Cameron's already been on the Today programme and, as I write, he's on the BBC News channel. Further policy announcements may come later this week.</p> <p>Oppositions are never happy to be out of the news at the best of times. But when the political environment is changing dramatically, and perceptions of the main parties are in flux, it's more important than ever for the Conservatives to try to shape public opinion.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Cameron, he's got a problem, which Nick Robinson has explained with admirable clarity <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/\">on his blog</a> this morning.</p> <blockquote> <p>On the banking crisis, he can't say \"I told you so\" because he didn't. He can't say \"We had a better answer\" because he didn't propose one and he's given his backing to the Brown plan.</p> <p>On what looks like a looming recession, he won't say \"Let's cut taxes to stimulate the economy\" - as the American and Australian governments have - because he's already declared that \"the cupboard is bare\" and that as a \"fiscal conservative\" he's not prepared to borrow to finance tax cuts.</p> <p>Thus, he's limited to proposing small-scale policy responses - yesterday a VAT holiday for small businesses, today a short-term tax cut for them - or to saying, like the Irishman in the old joke, \"I wouldn't have started here\".</p> </blockquote> <p>To be fair, Cameron says the Tories can say \"I told you so\" because they have been complaining about levels of debt in the economy. But it's hard to find evidence that they've been warning about lax regulation of the City leading to the near collapse of the global banking system, so Robinson's point is basically sound.</p> <p>Robinson also makes another important observation which, as far as I'm aware, hasn't been made elsewhere.</p> <blockquote> <p>In addition, the prime minister is addicted to his favourite electoral narrative - Labour investment versus Tory cuts - and sees the chance to run it again. Specifically, if - and it is a very big if - the government can bring forward its programme to rebuild schools, that would cut the money which the Tories have allocated for their \"free schools\" programme and allow ministers to ask, \"What would you cut to pay for your plans?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To add to Cameron's woes, Fraser Nelson at <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2452781/is-camerons-vat-plan-legal.thtml\">Coffee House</a> says the plan for a VAT holiday would be illegal under EU law. I've asked the Tories for a comment. They're still looking into it.</p> <p><strong>1pm Update: </strong> I've just had this email from a Tory spokesman: \"Fraser is wrong about EU law point. The govt did this during foot and mouth. EU laws only apply to rates of VAT - HMRC has discretion over collection of tax.\"</p>",

  "<p>In Hollywood, it seems, there is a rule: do not call Robin Williams a Dick and then walk away. You're likely <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994311.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">to wind up in court</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars\">Oscar</a>-winning actor is suing the makers of a shelved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a>, A Couple of Dicks, in which he was supposed to star as a private detective. In a suit filed at Los Angeles' superior court on Friday he has asked for $6m allegedly promised to him in the event of the movie not making it into cinemas.</p> <p>Williams was told in March that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy\">comedy</a>, which he was due to appear in alongside James Gandolfini, had been shelved by production companies Frank and Beans Productions and Gold Circle Films. He maintains that the two firms are still obliged to pay him under the terms of what is known in the industry as a \"pay or play deal\". </p> <p>Williams says that under his specific agreement the cut-off point for the film to start shooting was April 15. Gold Circle has reportedly put the project into \"turnaround\" with studio Warner Bros, meaning it may yet emerge at some point in the future. But the actor is insisting that he be paid regardless.</p> <p>The case highlights the inherent flaws of the \"pay or play\" deal, often used in Hollywood to persuade a big name actor to sign on for a film. Often there is no written agreement, although in Williams' case it appears that there was. Even so, it is customary for the contract to remain unsigned, as it seems to have been in this instance. John Cusack and Diane Lane are among other actors who have filed suits demanding they be paid under the terms of similar deals in recent years. </p> <p>In these times of financial difficulty, studios seem to be taking great care to avoid paying top dollar for talent. Only last week Terrence Howard was dumped as Colonel James Rhodes in Iron Man 2, a role he thought he had secured, in favour of Don Cheadle, reportedly over financial issues. Howard did not have a \"pay or play\" deal, according to trade bible Variety, but is probably wishing right now that he did.</p>",

Mosley says it has more to do with curbing \"the tabloid frenzy to destroy people's lives over eccentric sex.\" </p> <p>He tells <strong>Angelique Chrisa\ufb01s</strong>: \"The government has got something to answer for, for allowing this Murdoch culture.\" (For new readers, <strong>Rupert Murdoch's</strong> company, <strong>News International</strong>, owns the NoW). He also says: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"To live in a society where the rules are made by the [tabloid] editors, I think, would horrify most people. Particularly as it's very one-sided. </p> <p>\"They never hesitate, for example, to use completely illegal means to get information, such as bribing people with access to the police computer. So they can't talk about morality, they are immoral themselves.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the News of the World - and many journalists working elsewhere - would counter that their actions, even if immoral, are necessary in the wider public interest. (It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it). But it has always been difficult to decide where the public interest lay in the sensational revelations about Mosley's private sexual predilections.</p> <p>Anyway, the NoW may regret ever having tangled with Mosley, who is proving to be a terrier by refusing to let go. He has defamation and privacy cases pending in Germany, Italy and France, but it is the human rights action that could have far-reaching implications for the British press. </p> <p>Under his proposal, which would require editors to contact a person (or a company) before publishing a story, the subject would have a chance to seek a court injunction to prevent publication. Some newspaper lawyers believe this would cast a chill on investigative journalism.</p> <p>But Mosley tells Chrisafis it will not because a judge will not \"suppress that which should not be suppressed. But he will probably suppress the revelation of people's most private lives for no better purpose than to sell newspapers.\" </p> <p>I can understand Mosley's motives, and I certainly sympathise with him over his treatment by the News of the World, but I am not sure that I would place that much faith in judges. Nor would I favour a law that made it even easier for the rich and the powerful to seek injunctions. </p> <p>On the other hand, arguing with myself, I also happen to believe that newspapers should put allegations to people prior to publication. It might seem a cop-out to say this, but every case has to be treated on its merits, which tends to be the current state of play. </p> <p>In Mosley's case, there cannot be any doubt that if the paper had forewarned him of what it was about to publish - including the placing of video online - he would have gone to court. It is also likely that he would have obtained an injunction. </p> <p>Furthermore, if a full hearing had taken place at a later date it is also likely that he would have won, since the major public interest plank - the Nazi scenario - was provably false (as the paper would have discovered if it had bothered to have translated the German dialogue). </p> <p>Once again, it is hard not to reflect that a meretricious piece of journalism could lead to the enactment of a law that, in theory at least, could hobble responsible journalism.</p>",
  "<p>For anyone eagerly awaiting the next stage in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">EU-Russia</a> relations, last week's <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/16/content_10205382.htm\">European council</a> showed some ankle rather than a whole leg. The <a href=\"http://mnweekly.ru/news/20081016/55351197.html\">conclusions acknowledged</a> Russia's withdrawal from the Georgian \"buffer zones\" adjacent to Abkhazia and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">South Ossetia</a>, in line with last August's EU-negotiated peace agreement. But the rest of their thinking was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/eu-kosovo-brussels-summit\">put on ice</a>: instead of commenting now, the commission and the council will continue their comprehensive evaluation of EU-Russia relations in advance of the November 14 summit between the two sides. The commission will also consider the feasibility of a new \"Eastern partnership\" between the European Union, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. It is not necessarily a bad thing that the EU is keeping its powder dry: indeed, it may better prepare Europe to take advantage of a change in the dynamic between Brussels and Moscow, when their negotiators meet. </p> <p>After all, Russia is weaker now than it was two months ago. There are two reasons for this, but they share a bottom line. First, oil prices have fallen, hard. When Russia clashed with Georgia last summer, the price of crude had just peaked at $145 a barrel. By October 15 that price had dropped below $75 for the first time in four years. Oil has recently provided around 30% of the Russian government's income: the recent price drop is a massive loss in prospective revenue. Second, Russia's stock market has taken a pounding. The RTS index dropped 70% between May and October, with losses so sharp and sudden that the Micex has adopted the novel tactic of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/russia-stock-markets\">shutting itself down</a> \u2013 sometimes for days at a time \u2013 to stem the flow. Partly due to global economic circumstances, these falls are also down to Russia's trigger-happy adventurism in the Caucasus. On August 7, Russian forces entered Georgia: on August 8, $6bn left Russia. By September 19, another $50bn was gone. Investors don't like wars \u2013 or deviations from the rule of law. </p> <p>In the sober light of economic reality, Medvedev understands that Russia must reassure the markets. To that end, we have seen more biddable behaviour from the Russian government: at least partial adherence to the peace agreement; a presidential speech floating the idea of a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/russia \">security pact</a> between Moscow and Nato; and open calls for more foreign direct investment from the west. The \u20ac4bn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/banking-iceland\">bail-out for Iceland</a> that Russia is apparently negotiating, and a closer military <a href=\"http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081016/117766697.html\">relationship with Syria</a> are down to Russia's pride on the one hand and its business sense on the other. Moscow is keen to maintain its strong image, but money is the true name of the game and its leaders knows they must therefore come to the table.</p> <p>A new partnership agreement between the EU and Russia is a fine goal in the long term; but first things first. Europe needs to show that it will neither abandon its allies on Russia's border, nor roll over when confronted by bad behaviour from Moscow. To that end, the EU should signal its continued support for an eastern partnership, the refusal of its member states to be part of any new pact that could undermine their security or the future role of Nato, and its expectation that Russia will abide by its commitments to peace. </p> <p>At next month's negotiations, Europeans should also raise the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-poison16-2008oct16,0,5763910.story\">case of Karina Moskalenko</a>, the prominent lawyer representing the family of murdered journalist and human rights activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/15/anna-politkovskaya-pressandpublishing\">Anna Politkovskaya</a>. Last Monday, she was poisoned with mercury while in her car in Strasbourg. This is strongly reminiscent of the murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with polonium-210 two years ago in London. While this goes on we cannot talk about \"shared values\" as the Russians want us to: at most we can talk about mutual interests. The Russian leadership must show that it is not only innocent of ordering these crimes, but that it is able and willing to stop them from occurring. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin is the bare-chested tough guy who likes us to know that he can topple billionaire oligarchs, grind Chechen rebels into the dust and reshape the geography of Europe. Don't tell me he can't stop the murders of key activists who just happen to have opposed him publicly.</p>",
  "<p>On paper, the idea looks like a conservation masterstroke. Take a huge swath of pristine rainforest, put a price on the rainfall it produces and other \"services\", and sell these off to rich philanthropists with a conscience.</p> <p>That's precisely the rescue package dreamt up by investment house <a href=\"http://canopycapital.co.uk\">Canopy Capital</a>. And it's working. The London-based firm has persuaded 10 wealthy individuals to buy into the \"ecosystem services\" of Guyana's heavily forested Iwokrama Reserve. </p> <p>The logic is straightforward. Trees need to be worth more standing up than chopped down. Giving them a \"utility value\" is one way of achieving that. </p> <p>\"How can it be that Google's services are worth billions, but those from all the world's rainforests amount to nothing?\" Canopy Capital's director, Hylton Philipson, is fond of saying. </p> <p>Putting a price on trees' services \u2014 climate regulation, biodiversity maintenance and water storage, for example \u2014 is the latest in a long list of market-based measures designed to save Latin America's forests. </p> <p>Governments across the region have bought into ecotourism, forest certification, biodiversity offsets and carbon emission trading in recent years. </p> <p>Market-based mechanisms appeal because they appear a win-win, says Ronnie Hall, coordinator for Global Forest Coalition, an international coalition of environmental groups. </p> <p>\"Governments don't have to dip into the public purse so much, and private investors think they can make a profit out of it \u2026 It's very skewed. In the end, it's all become about money\", she says. </p> <p>As the world's financial markets totter, Latin Americans are wondering if the business theorists haven't hoodwinked them. </p> <p>\"The problems that have been caused by companies with their own rules cannot be solved by the same companies with the same rules,\" says Ana Filippini, spokesperson for the <a href=\"http://www.wrm.org.uy\">World Rainforest Movement</a>, a Uruguayan-based conservation group.</p> <p>Despite millions being poured into sustainable projects in the Amazon, for example, illegal loggers are still hard at work in the world's largest rainforest. Monthly deforestation rates in August were almost three times higher than the same time last year, according to <a href=\"http://www.inpe.br\">Brazil's National Institute for Space Research</a>.</p> <p>Business-based schemes also have a habit of generating unintended consequences. The Global Forest Coalition lists examples in a new report, Life as Commerce: the Impact of Market-based Conservation. </p> <p>Take tree plantations. Under the Kyoto protocol, the carbon captured by so-called carbon sinks can be sold to buyers in developing countries. As a result, companies across the continent have been fighting over themselves to plant fast-growing plantations for the profitable carbon market. </p> <p>The climate change benefits of monoculture plantations, however, are arguably offset by the enormous damage they cause to local biodiversity. </p> <p>In endorsing commercial plantations, timber certification schemes such as the <a href=\"http://www.fsc.org\">Forest Stewardship Council</a> are also cited in the report for doing more harm than good. </p> <p>Market-based schemes fail the residents of Latin America's forests as much as the forests themselves, says the Global Forest Coalition. </p> <p>Often complex and poorly explained, business mechanisms frequently leave local inhabitants sidelined and disenfranchised. </p> <p>In Costa Rica, for example, conflicts have flared up among indigenous groups after individuals in these communities sold medicinal plants to pharmaceutical companies \u2014 a practice known as bioprospecting. </p> <p>Forest communities in Colombia, meanwhile, have reportedly lost control over what trees to plant on their own land after agreeing to participate in a carbon-credit reforestation programme. </p> <p>In some cases, the forests they were regenerating have been reclassified as stubble to make way for timber plantations. </p> <p>\"Although there's a theoretical opportunity for indigenous people, they can't really engage [with market-based schemes] because there's so many hurdles they have to jump,\" says Hall. </p> <p>Just as they have with the financial markets, governments need to step in with a robust rescue plan, says Sergio Leitao, campaign director of <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/brasil\">Greenpeace Brazil</a>.</p> <p>\"We can't leave such an important subject for the future of the planet as forest preservation in private hands,\" he says. <br> He cites the example of Paraguay, not a country associated with strong public governance. A recent moratorium on deforestation cut illegal logging in the forest-rich state by 83% in one year. </p> <p>Simone Lovera, author of the report, suggests an alternative: leave the forest communities of Latin America to protect their natural habitat. </p> <p>After all, the best-preserved forests today are found on indigenous territories, she points out. \"Indigenous-led conservation initiatives have proven to be very cost-efficient,\" she says.</p> <p>Regrettably, few residents of Latin America's forests are likely to make it to the next round of climate change talks in Poland in December. As business-minded negotiators brush down their suits in preparation, though, the message of cost-efficiency may win them a hearing.</p>",
  "<p>The government is preparing to open family courts up to greater media scrutiny, in response to criticism that the current set up is overly secretive.</p> <p>The justice secretary, Jack Straw, is expected to unveil plans to make the family justice system more transparent, but the government is yet to set a date for the policy change.</p> <p>The move would spark anger among some child protection groups but would be welcomed by campaigners who accuse the courts of administering \"secretive justice\".</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4974534.ece\">the Times today, Sir Mark Potter, the president of the family division</a>, called for greater openness in hearings on whether children should be taken into care.</p> <p>\"It is my firm belief that when people see these cases in action, and the extreme care with which they are dealt - and the fact that so much of what is said comes from interested and disgruntled parties not reporting the matter objectively - it can do nothing but good for the system,\" he said.</p> <p>But Ian Johnson, the chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers, said he feared the move could threaten children's right to privacy.</p> <p>\"The nature of some of the information dealt with in family courts should just not be in the public domain. I just don't agree with this argument that having the press there will result in better social services.\"</p> <p>Speaking at the Labour conference in Manchester last month, Straw indicated that reforms were afoot.</p> <p>\"In the very sensitive area of the family courts I think we can shed more light whilst preserving the imperative of the welfare of the child.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice began a public consultation on openness in family courts in June last year, but the government is yet to respond to its findings.</p>",
  "<p>With a dozen UK universities standing to lose \u00a377m in collapsed Icelandic banks, the higher education sector appears, along with everyone else, to be facing an uncertain future. But could the global financial downturn in fact spell good fortune for the UK's universities?</p> <p>The evidence from previous recessions is that business schools and universities tend to benefit. In a difficult recruitment situation, people take time out to embark on master's degrees to improve their CV and knowledge while they ride it out, says Jonathan Slack, chief executive of the Association of Business Schools (ABS).</p> <p>\"That certainly happened in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly at master's level where the demand seemed to spike up,\" Slack says. \"You might anticipate a decline in interest for financial programmes in this situation but that hasn't happened.\"</p> <p>Business and management is the most popular subject at degree level and is taken in some form by one in seven students. The findings of a survey by ABS this week show undergraduate demand from home and EU students for business school courses is up, particularly masters of business administration (MBA) courses.</p> <p>\"The numbers taking an MBA course full-time appears to be strong, but part-time is mixed, with some of the 40 schools who responded saying it's OK and others saying numbers have dropped,\" Slack says.</p> <p>Business schools tend to have overseas students from a broader range of countries than universities as a whole, so where the number of Chinese students is tailing off, they are seeing rising interest from oil and gas nations and Pakistan.</p> <p>\"Apart from a few cases where schools are reporting they are not getting the full number of overseas students they were expecting, overall it appears from our survey that there are no major problems.\" Slack says.</p> <p>Postgraduate and specialist master's programmes overall look strong, but numbers on executive level MBA courses are likely to suffer where they are much more closely affected by the uncertain future corporate companies face.</p> <p>\"For universities it's good. The usual thing is that people who become unemployed tend to study to improve their chances in the future,\" agrees Janette Rutterford, professor of financial management at the Open University (OU) business school.</p> <p>She says: \"You typically see increases in the numbers doing MBAs, law and accounting courses as people look for courses that offer tangible qualifications with professional credibility.\"</p> <p>Rutterford says the OU stands to gain in particular because of the nature of the distance learning it offers students. </p> <p>\"You'll see more students studying part-time with jobs to cover themselves. Staying at home and doing an OU degree makes sense,\" she says.</p> <p>MBAs become even more popular in a downturn as they are globally recognised qualifications that show initiative, a global outlook and offer a mixture of the practical and the academic to improve job prospects, Rutterford says.</p> <p>\"There are opportunities,\" she says. \"Universities are also changing the courses they produce and looking at courses that will appeal to people in a recession. We have level 1 courses that people can take as part of a degree course or outside of it.</p> <p>\"Our introduction to business studies course has 2,400 students a year on it and we are looking to turn it into a foundation degree in financial services.\"</p> <p>Universities will also benefit from people wanting to retrain. Manchester Metropolitan may have lost money in the collapse of Iceland's banking system but an open evening for the university's nursing course last week had a \"surprising\" amount of interest from people with a financial background wanting a complete career change.</p> <p>According to Dr Mary Meldrum, head of postgraduate programmes at the university's business school, course numbers are way up this year. Attendance on the master's project management courses is three times higher than expected and courses in human resources management and international business have also seen an increase.</p> <p>She says: \"Project management has taken off this year, I think that's because there are still a lot of jobs in that area and there's a big demand.</p> <p>\"There's been a noticeable growth in UK students, which may be due to difficulties in graduates getting jobs as it's mainly people who are fresh graduates. We've seen a 25% increase in the proportion of UK numbers on last year and overseas numbers are also up.\"</p> <p>The school is launching \"block mode\" MBAs where students can come in for three day courses every few months as there is sufficient demand from people in work who want to protect themselves by getting more qualifications.</p> <p>With increasing numbers of people applying to university, it's clear they still see higher education as a worthwhile investment in their future, says Prof Rick Trainor, president of vice-chancellor's group Universities UK.</p> <p>He says: \"In an economic downturn, investment in research, development and higher-level education by government and private enterprise is more important than ever.</p> <p>\"We know that as the UK economy continues to shift towards knowledge-based activities it is likely that a greater proportion of the workforce will need higher-level skills.</p> <p>The sector, he says, is well placed to produce the workforce needed for a highly skilled knowledge-based economy and to meet the government's target of 40% of the adult population having a higher education qualification.</p> <p>According to Trainor: \"Individuals are likely to need to re-skill at several points in their working lives to keep pace with employer expectations, and remain in the workforce for longer.</p> <p>\"In this future landscape, public policy will need to support the tendency for people to move in and out of study and work, in practical ways.\"</p> <p>But Philip Harding, finance director at the University of Westminster and chair of the British Universities Finance Directors Group (Bufdug), says universities are going to face tough times.</p> <p>\"There's evidence to suggest we're not going to get a generous settlement out of the next spending review so the signs aren't looking good in terms of university finances,\" he says.</p> <p>The general global recession will affect the mobility of overseas students and universities could also see a downturn in their numbers, which a fair number rely on as a substantial part of their income, Harding says.</p> <p>The collapse of stock markets will also increase universities' pension deficits.</p> <p>\"Oil prices are coming down but they are still at levels higher than most universities will have anticipated, and universities face cost pressures of pay and utilities bills,\" Harding says.</p> <p>And universities are \"still reeling\" at the bad timing of the inflation figure set last week, which will mean a 5% pay rise for university staff this year.</p> <p>\"RPI [inflation] has peaked at the wrong time for universities; it's good for staff but not for universities \u2013 they face tough times and more potential job losses.\"</p>",

  "<p>Gripped by a desire to ensure that misery is distributed as widely as possible, the cry goes up to ensure that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/16/occupational-pensions-pensions\">public pensions are cut</a> as drastically as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-great-pension-divide-which-side-are-you-on-964163.html\">private pensions</a> in the wake of stock-market <a href=\"http://www.londonstockexchange.com/en-gb/pricesnews/investnews/article.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic%20WBC?ArticleID=18829162\">swoons</a>. </p> <p>Not so fast. <a href=\"http://www.professionalpensions.com/821232\">Cutting public sector pensions</a> is legally difficult, since they were part of a formal contract between employer and employee that cannot be unilaterally changed by one of the parties. Morally it is equally dubious \u2013 public workers have historically accepted lower levels of current compensation in return for pension security. The argument that a few bureaucratic high-flyers have recently received juicy rewards is irrelevant here, since the future cost of public pensions relates to the entitlements built up over many years by the great mass of employees who were modestly remunerated.</p> <p>Private sector employees, some of them rather poorly-paid, will nevertheless be unhappy if they have to pay stiff taxes to finance what \u2013 the tabloids will assure them \u2013 are exorbitant perks for people who should be grateful for having a job at all.</p> <p>They would do better to forgo the sad satisfactions of ressentiment and instead seek out ways to ensure better pensions for themselves, happy at the thought that the dinner ladies and nurses, teachers and park attendants they (indirectly) employ deserve decent pensions.</p> <p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have just shown us how huge sums can be conjured up, especially where they can be invested in such as way as to repay the debt at some time in the future. Why not bring in a share levy on all firms employing more than 20 people or with a turnover of over \u00a310m \u2013 the levy to comprise new shares worth 10% of profits each year? These shares would be held in a national pension savings scheme (NPSS) to pay a second pension to all private sector employees. </p> <p>This would be a scheme designed not to do down the public sector workers, but rather to improve the lot of those in the private sector. Legislation is nearly complete to set up such a NPSS. It would be greatly strengthened if it had an extra source of employer contributions. The shares raised by the levy would not be sold but held to yield future income. They would not subtract from a firm's cashflow or reduce the resources available for investment. The new social funds could help to establish the sort of state pension fund that <a href=\"http://www.pensionfundsonline.co.uk/statistics/statistics.aspx\">Norway already enjoys</a> and which has helped to stabilise the Norwegian economy. Rather than spreading misery they would help to reduce it. And it should appeal to those who advise us to level up rather than level down. Since we live in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/population.socialtrends\">ageing society</a>, it also makes sense to plan extra resources for it now \u2026 not weaken existing schemes.</p>",
  "<p>So it seems that <a href=\"http://www.hardens.com/restaurant-news/uk-london/16-10-08/jay-rayner-hardens-criticisms/\">Harden's are up to their old tricks again</a>, gaining more publicity through an engineered spat with an established newspaper reviewer and, although it wounds me deeply to throw more petrol on the flames by prolonging the debate, I'm irresistably drawn to chip in. There are two reasons for this. First, I'm not a reviewer and have no ambitions in that direction and secondly, before taking up the far more agreeable life of a food writer, I spent a decade consulting to clients about the threat to established media from new technologies.</p> <p>A couple of years is a long time in new media and, back then Harden's and all the other burgeoning review sites were right to consider themselves cutting edge. The whole idea of collating regular punters' reviews online, of empowering real consumers to inform each other was a great business model. It felt like democratisation, it gave a voice to real people and, of course, the best bit was that it made a business out of free content.</p> <p>Back then, the dead-tree media didn't know how badly wrong they were getting it. Traditional journalists (with a few honourable exceptions) didn't blog, felt that making their work available online was like burning money and would as soon post on a food community board as write a piece for a local freesheet.</p> <p>I grew up writing for the web and participating in online communities. I've been committed to them because I felt they embodied everything that was good about the internet - uniting disparate groups through shared special interest, putting control of the media back into the hands of real people - but over the last couple of years those communities have changed.</p> <p>The big food boards used to be a place to find vibrant new food writing, now they're filled with the same old suspects having the same conversations over and over again: who's getting or losing stars and how badly we disagree with them, how crap such and such a reviewer is and how we don't agree with them either. Why have they stagnated? Because technology has moved on. The good writers have left now, bored of the endless Jesuitical wrangling over the same subjects, to set up their own blogs and most of the readers have followed them. Nobody needs a community to pull them together when they have RSS.</p> <p>For a short time the online review sites were a creditable source of information. The self-selecting group of opinionated restaurant collectors that bothered to write reviews sometimes had something useful to contribute, but it didn't take long for the good ones to realise that while there's something noble about writing an honest and well crafted review and putting it out there on the web for the public to read, there's something, well \u2026 stupid \u2026 about giving it to an organisation to profit from. All of the established food boards and online review sites were set up with a view to turning a profit from content provided free by punters and they profited while old media snoozed. Now, like old media, they've now been overtaken by technology.</p> <p>So many sites, awards and lists have sprung up that the market has become crowded. It's difficult to take any of them seriously - which is why they spend so much time in ugly, childish slanging matches. Meanwhile, blogging has enabled anyone with an opinion to express it without needing the imprimatur of organisations like <a href=\"http://www.hardens.com/\">Harden's</a> to do it. I don't go to Harden's for a restaurant review, like most people I go to Google, which in turn gives me half a dozen great blogs, better writing and a more realistic spread of opinion. Funnily enough, the reviews I enjoy reading, once I've been through this process, as often as not come from old school, professional reviewers whose opinions are couched in quality writing and, now they've caught up with the technology, are freely available on the web.</p> <p>The online review sites' big idea was \"don't trust newspaper reviewers, trust other punters - come to us\". A couple of years down the line technology has rolled on and today its \"don't trust online review sites, Google other punters\". If online review sites merely collate punters' opinions they are no longer necessary, if they attempt to add value by setting themselves up as arbiter then they are the same as the reviewers they hate so much. Either way they are irrelevant.</p> <p>As wired readers and as consumers of restaurants and reviews, I'm really interested in what the WoM audience thinks. In the world of reviewing are there any 'brands' that matter to you? Do you trust an old school 'name' reviewer? Do you buy into anyone's proprietary rating system? Are you drawn to particular chefs or do you just Google for opinions and make up your own mind?</p>",

  "<p>It's a crisp, sunny morning in Colorado Springs. We've decided to spend another day in this mile-high Rocky Mountain city, soaking up some of its renowned conservative Christian spirit while we await the arrival of Sarah Palin tomorrow morning. It being Sunday, some of us have decided to go to church - and not just any church. At 10:00 we head out toward the expansive \"campus\" of <a href=\"http://www.newlifechurch.org/\">New Life Church</a>, located on the outskirts of town a stone's throw away from the US Air Force Academy and beneath the looming presence of Pike's Peak. </p> <p>As huge as it is, this isn't the largest evangelical mega-church in America, but it is probably the most famous and it certainly has been the most influential: Its founder and former pastor, Ted Haggard, headed the National Association of Evangelicals and reportedly had a <a href=\"http://www.therevealer.org/archives/timely_001945.php\">direct line </a>to the Bush White House\u2014right up to the moment when he <a href=\"http://coloradoindependent.com/904/pastor-who\">was caught </a>buying meth and having sex with a male prostitute in 2006. <br> When we arrive at the enormous \"Worship Center,\" the lobbies are bedlam, as busy as Grand Central Station during any rush hour. Parents are lining up at check-in counters to drop off their kids for Sunday school sessions before rushing into a space that looks more like a high-tech concert hall than a church, with elaborate sound systems, TV cameras, screens scrolling Biblical texts, and a backdrop that changes from light blue to crimson to a simulacrum of a traditional church, stained glass and all. Two armed city cops stand guard at the door: Last December, a young man who had been bounced out of a missionary training program in Denver <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7140409.stm\">opened fire </a>at the end of a service here, killing two and wounding two others. </p> <p>By 11:00 sharp the hall, which has a <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_/ai_n10043749\">capacity of 7,500</a>, looks packed. The New Life congregation alone numbers over 12,000. And this weekend Colorado Springs's other famous fundamentalist institution, James Dobson's <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2109621/\">Focus on the Family</a>, is hosting a <a href=\"http://www.ndptf.org/summit/\">National Day of Prayer Summit</a>, timed to take place \"just days before our national and local elections\" because, its organizers say, \"As we look over our country, we see a land in need of the Savior, Jesus Christ,\" and they want the faithful to \"pray and intercede with fellow believers for this critical hour in which we live.\" </p> <p>People like myself, brought up to expect the solemnn silence that settles over mainline protestant churches as the parishioners file in and the service begins, were ill prepared for what we would experience here. The parade of people flowing in looks more like they are attending a football game: Young women with low-cut blouses, men in shorts, their bellies bursting out of tee shirts, a Vietnam vet in a motorcycle jacket with the word \"Sniper\" boldly etched on it. There are very few suits. There are even fewer non-white faces: I spot one black person, a couple of Asian Americans and Latinos. The crowd is loud and ebullient, filling the aisles with chatter. I hear one woman giving another advice about helping an injured rabbit. A third companion chimes in that the Parables can be a big help when dealing with animals.</p> <p>Suddenly, all hell - so to speak - breaks loose. The lights dim, and the nine-piece Desperation Band lays down the Christian beat, singing, \"You are greater, greater than the fight that rages for my life.\" Standing on risers behind the rock band, a choir of some 70 people sways in unison. Most in the audience are on their feet, hands stretched upwards in the Pentecostal reach towards God. Many ecstatic parishioners begin to dance in place. They remain standing for a good half hour while the band bangs out one tune after another. Finally it stops, and they gratefully collapse into their chairs. A preacher appears and asks everyone to take their minds off their financial problems and apply a magnifying glass to God - and fork over some money to the church. Men with white plastic buckets make their way through the aisles. Some people put in change or bills, but a surprising number give nothing.</p> <p>Another preacher appears and begins to talk about all the great things the church is doing, and how he himself has it on for the people of the Ukraine, a post-Communist country that, as he describes it, badly needs their help. He prays for the Ukranians for a while, then moves on to the natives of the Amazon rainforest, whom some of the congregants will soon be visiting on what sounds like a combination of missionary work and exotic vacation. We leave before the end of the service, and as we head off of the New Life grounds, we pass a group of men standing at the roadside, waving big Sarah Palin signs. They give us a fistful of tickets for Monday morning's rally. </p> <p>Palin is sure to feel the love when she speaks to the crowd here in the city that has been described as the \"Evangelical Vatican.\" But she will be, literally, preaching to the converted. And it turns out even the conservative evangelicals aren't united behind the Republican Party the way they used to be: In a <a href=\"http://egan.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/my-own-private-focus-group/?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=\" rss\"\">recent interview </a>the current New Life pastor, Brady Boyd, cited the financial crisis as \"point number one,\" and said: \"The only advice I give is pray, fast and vote, and that can be for any political party...What's happening to us is less allegiance to the Republican party, and more to our core principles.\" </p> <p>Others on the Christian right <a href=\"http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Sep/02/palin-no-stranger-focus-family/\">remain steadfast </a>to the GOP. But the fact that the ticket is losing despite the addition of Sarah Palin clearly proves something: While conservative Christians may be a formidable force in American politics, they can't elect a president by themselves. The right-wing evangelicals joined a Republican coalition that also included libertarians, hawkish neocons, working-class \"Reagan Democrats,\" and old-fashioned fiscal conservatives. And some of these are now leaving the flock in favor of what Christopher Buckley, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/10/10/buckley_bails/index.html?source=\" rss\"\">endorsing Obama</a>, called a \"first-class temperament and a first-class intellect.\" It's quite something to be judged too erratic or too stupid by people who once supported George W. Bush - but in some minds, McCain and Palin seem to have achieved that dubious distinction.</p>"
