  "<p>Way to go, Joe. You were nobody's first choice to step into a volatile situation at Newcastle, with players' confidence at an all-time low, fans' feelings running dangerously high and the famous continental-style management hierarchy operating from a bunker, so obviously it was a smart move to scandalise and alienate the local press on day one. </p> <p>What looked a short-term appointment last week could now be getting shorter by the day, though at least Joe Kinnear's hilarious strop (if you still haven't read it go to theguardian.com/football) could be put down to the exceptional circumstances. It's not every day you get a job in a circus, after all.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, on the other hand, have 34 years of top-level experience between them at their present clubs and they, too, appear to have grown so used to getting their own way they stamp their feet in annoyance when confronted with anything they cannot control. </p> <p>Ferguson has just threatened to speak even less to the media than he already does, because he is furious with himself for saying Chelsea are getting on a bit. 'I never said they were too old,' he insisted at a recent press conference, pressing for a correction but only succeeding in protesting too much. 'You lot said that, so you only have yourselves to blame. What I said was that they were an experienced team. I said, and it's true, that when players go into their thirties you don't get a lot of improvement. Whereas the United team that won the title last season has several young players who can still get better.' </p> <p>Got that? Any suggestion that Chelsea might be over the hill is a wilful misrepresentation of what Ferguson said. Not in any way his mistake. The bloke has only been in charge since Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp, after all, how is he supposed to know how the press works? This is not a defence of spin - there just doesn't happen to be a world of difference between what Ferguson said and how it was reported. He is spitting the dummy over semantics. One suspects this has less to do with newspaper headlines than Chelsea's promising start to the season, or United being behind Liverpool. </p> <p>But at least Ferguson did not say he felt physically sick, which as unsporting reactions to unexpected home defeats go is almost as bad as confusing Hull City with West Brom. Sour grapes in the immediate aftermath of Hull's stirring performance at the Emirates could just about be excused, though when Wenger was still moaning two days later it just sounded plain sour. Especially when he expressly stated, the day before Porto were rolled over 4-0 in a one-sided match much more to Wenger's liking, that Champions League opponents know they have a responsibility to play, whereas Hull's first responsibility was not to lose.</p> <p>The famous Wenger habit of missing crucial incidents appears suddenly to have been extended to whole games. In the match most people saw last week, Hull adventurously turned up with three up front and then bravely bounced back from an own goal, playing with such panache throughout that the home crowd applauded them off at the end. Wenger seems unable to work out how this could have happened. If Arsenal lost they must have been kicked off the park or stifled by a 10-man defence. It was as if Hull simply had no right to win. Wenger's reputation as a fair-minded devotee of attacking football has just taken a knock, as will his reputation as a manager if he cannot sort out his defence. </p> <p>There could be all sorts of reasons why Wenger and Ferguson are feeling more pressure than usual, from good starts made by Chelsea, Liverpool and Aston Villa, to the money at Manchester City and not forgetting Michel Platini's desire to limit the number of countries that regularly send four teams to the Champions League, but good manners cost nothing and the Premier League's elder statesmen ought to set a better example. At the moment they are being shamed by newcomers such as Luiz Felipe Scolari, Phil Brown and Paul Ince, all under pressure in different ways yet all looking happy in the Premier League. </p> <p>As well they might. It is not such a bad place to be and it is not as if anyone has asked them to sort out Newcastle or Tottenham. Or even Fenerbahce, where Luis Aragon\u00e9s is struggling to win over his new public after making a poor start to the Turkish season on returning to club football following his European Championship-winning exploits with Spain. </p> <p>Well known for his sunny disposition, Aragon\u00e9s came up with a quite stunning response during a press conference in which his methods were being questioned. 'It's easy for you to have views about football,' he told reporters with a sigh. 'But you will never find me talking about journalism.' Bet Kinnear wishes he had thought of that now. Instead, he could soon find north-east reporters adopting the opposite position. 'It's easy for you to have views on journalism, Joe. But we're supposed to be here to talk about football.'</p> <h2>Capello hoping confidence trick can make dreary Wembley like glorious Zagreb</h2> <p>For Fabio Capello's next trick, he will attempt to bring the excitement generated in Zagreb last month to dreary old Wembley.</p> <p>Before a writ arrives from the Football Association it should be stressed that Wembley itself is not dreary any more, just the atmosphere when England are playing.</p> <p>That, Capello reckons, is what has been holding back England as an international force, the reason the players have not been performing for their country as well as they play for their clubs. 'We play better away from home,' Capello says. 'I have noticed that already. We can play with confidence away, whereas at Wembley there is doubt. The fans grow restless and unhappy and the doubt becomes more pronounced.'</p> <p>Fair enough, but now for the $64,000 question, or perhaps the \u00a36m-a-year question. What can Capello do to change all that? England struggling to impress their own fans at Wembley is a story older than the hills, though Capello stunned the locals in Croatia so give him a chance. Kazakhstan at home on Saturday may appear the ideal occasion for England to bask in the reflected glory of their 4-1 triumph in Zagreb, but Capello wants none of it.</p> <p>'I hope the Croatia result can help with our confidence and make the crowd more enthused,' he says. 'But really we have to forget about Zagreb now because it is in the past. You must focus on every game you play, that is my philosophy. We have six points and we must play every remaining game like it is a cup final. It is important to win, but you do that by focusing on your next game, not your last.'</p> <p>It is just as well Capello did not mention taking each game as it comes, otherwise it might be suspected someone at the FA is teaching him cliches as a joke. His English is coming on well, as it happens, and he has proved he can organise and motivate his players, but what does he know about Kazakhstan? 'Mainly that when Croatia played them they scored on 13 minutes and it was easy after that. They are not strong like Croatia, but you need to concentrate. It is very easy to lose concentration when you have won an important match and it is followed by an easy game, and if you do that the second game will not be easy at all. It always helps to score a goal quickly if you can. If you don't, it can become a problem, as we discovered against Andorra.'</p> <p>Capello names his squad this evening and it would appear Michael Owen has not done enough to be in it, unless he makes a timely case for himself this afternoon at Everton. Injuries permitting, Emile Heskey definitely will be. The Wigan striker was outstanding in Croatia and, though Capello has no hesitation in naming Marco van Basten and Ruud van Nistelrooy as the best centre-forwards he worked with in his club career, he has clearly been impressed by a player often labelled a dinosaur. 'I don't agree that Heskey is an old-fashioned centre-forward, they used to be big and stationary,' Capello says. 'Heskey is modern - big, but fast with good movement.'</p> <p>Finally, while David James may be on the verge of ejection from Owen's fantasy football team, his national manager is more relaxed about him letting in 10 goals in two matches. 'I saw some of those games on television,' Capello says. 'Enough to know that it is impossible for the keeper when opponents score 10 in two games. The defence has to do more. It wasn't as if there were just 10 chances and they were all taken. I counted about 20 chances to score.'</p> <h2>Time for a Spurs ban</h2> <p>Tottenham fans' vilification of Sol Campbell has become an annual event and is an affront to a civilised society. Spurs should have seen it coming and acted much more decisively to make sure their supporters behaved themselves at Portsmouth, instead of joining the police in the general cop-out that it is impossible to arrest a whole away end. </p> <p>If Spurs cannot or will not control their own supporters, there is only one way to reinforce the message that these sickening chants will not be tolerated and that is to deny the club entry to the next available competition, let's say the FA Cup. Perfectly simple, really. Well, that's what everyone said when it was Croatia supporters abusing Emile Heskey.</p>",
  "<p>The Marquis Luca Cordero di Montezemolo has never been reluctant to utilise an aristocratic background and his status as president of Fiat and Ferrari. The former lawyer will frequently call upon his multilingual eloquence in the knowledge that the Italian media will be eager to record every syllable. Di Montezemolo's utterances are worth listening to, if not for their content then for the passionate and captivating style of delivery. His comments usually flow like the uplifting fine wine that accompanies a Ferrari dinner, but his review of last Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix smacked of sour grapes.</p> <p>Di Montezemolo was alone among team patrons when he heavily criticised a brilliantly executed and novel event. That should be no surprise, because the head of Ferrari failed to witness at first hand Formula One's inaugural night race within a community bending over backwards to make a brave gamble succeed.</p> <p>'Unfortunately, when we race on tracks where staging a circus or something else would be better, anything can happen, because the spectacle is supplied by the safety car,' Di Montezemolo said. 'This is humiliating for F1.'</p> <p>Correction: it was deeply humiliating for Ferrari. It is ironic that Di Montezemolo should refer to a circus when, in fact, his team provided a pit-stop spectacle that would have been classified as slapstick comedy had the implications not been so serious. In the time it took a team member to activate a green light prematurely, Felipe Massa's chance of winning was lost in chaos as he left the Ferrari pit, dragging the fuel hose that would bowl over three mechanics and spray petrol as it went.</p> <p>By the time he reached the end of the pit lane and waited for his breathless crew to arrive and then struggle to remove the remains of the fuel line, Massa probably did not wish to contemplate the thought that this shambles might cost him the championship when the points are finally added up after the Brazilian Grand Prix on 2 November.</p> <p>Until that moment, Massa had done everything possible to win the 15th round of the championship and overhaul Lewis Hamilton's one-point lead. The Brazilian's pole-position lap the previous day had been sublime, the seemingly effortless performance highlighting the Ferrari's ability to soak up the bumps that troubled many of the drivers.</p> <p>While it was true that he had been carrying less fuel, Massa appeared to have the measure of Hamilton as he pulled out a useful lead. Indeed, rather than attack his championship rival, Hamilton's attention was focussed on Kimi Raikkonen, as the other Ferrari began to threaten seriously the McLaren driver's second place. Raikkonen was due to run for an extra couple of laps before stopping, during which time he could have overhauled Hamilton. But an incident was about to turn the race on its head and hand victory to Renault's Fernando Alonso, who might otherwise have finished an also-ran.</p> <p>Di Montezemolo is correct when he refers to the appearance of the safety car contributing to the spectacle. But he also means that Nelson Piquet's crash, which triggered the appearance of the official car, effectively robbed Ferrari of a possible one-two finish. </p> <p>Incidents are inevitable on street circuits with walls and barriers in close attendance. Di Montezemolo's frustration can be understood, but the Ferrari boss must accept that an insistence on using a system of lights, rather than a man with a 'lollipop', in order to save just a tenth of a second during a pit stop has cost them dear. </p> <p>It is not the first time that this complex process has caused problems for Ferrari and highlights the fact that this year's title race is so close that victory will go to the team making the fewest mistakes. This is clearly a philosophy that has been understood by McLaren as Hamilton risked nothing last Sunday and settled for a safe third place to extend his lead to seven points going into next weekend's Japanese Grand Prix, followed a week later by the penultimate round in China.</p> <p>The Mount Fuji and Shanghai circuits, both purpose-built, will have an anticlimactic feel after the buzz provided by the landmark event last weekend. A race that worked well under floodlights has given F1 increased flexibility by sidestepping the problems created when running in daylight in the Far East while being screened at antisocial hours in Europe. But it would be a mistake to assume that all races in eastern time zones should be run at night. Not only would the novelty value dissipate, but the use of 1,600 floodlights on the Suzuka track would be impractical and fail to demonstrate the taxing terrain of that Japanese circuit when it returns to the calendar next year.</p> <p>In the meantime, Bernie Ecclestone's gamble on Singapore has paid off in every respect. F1's guru will have noted that the race's close proximity to important financial institutions brought F1 to leading commercial players who would not otherwise have come to experience the sport's value, both on and off the track. Perhaps that very point exacerbated the president of Ferrari's discomfort even further.</p> <h2>How they stand</h2> <p><strong>1 L Hamilton </strong>McLaren<strong> 84</strong></p> <p><strong>2 F Massa </strong>Ferrari<strong> 77</strong></p> <p><strong>3 R Kubica </strong> BMW <strong>64</strong></p> <p><strong>4 K Raikkonen </strong>Ferrari<strong> 57</strong></p> <p><strong>5 N Heidfeld </strong>BMW<strong> 56</strong></p> <p><strong>6 H Kovalainen </strong>McLaren<strong> 51</strong></p> <p><strong>7 F Alonso </strong>Renault<strong> 38</strong></p> <p><strong>8 S Vettel </strong>Toro Rosso<strong> 27</strong></p> <p><strong>9 J Trulli </strong>Toyota<strong> 26</strong></p> <p><strong>10= T Glock </strong>Toyota<strong> 20</strong></p> <p><strong> M Webber </strong>Red Bull<strong> 20</strong></p> <p><strong>12 N Rosberg </strong>Williams<strong> 17</strong></p> <p><strong>13 N Piquet </strong>Renault<strong> 13</strong></p> <p><strong>14 R Barrichello </strong>Honda<strong> 11</strong></p> <p><strong>15 K Nakajima </strong>Williams<strong> 9</strong></p> <p><strong>16 D Coulthard </strong>Red Bull<strong> 8</strong></p> <p><strong>17 S Bourdais </strong>Toro Rosso<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>18 J Button </strong>Honda<strong> 3</strong></p> <p><strong>Remaining races:</strong> <strong>Sunday </strong>Japan, <strong>19 October</strong> China, <strong>2 November</strong> Brazil</p>",
  "<p>When the credit crunch exploded onto the world's financial markets last summer, politicians and bankers in the eurozone found it hard to avoid feeling at least a little smug. Apart from a couple of high-profile early casualties, most continental financial institutions appeared to have avoided the racy business practices that had endangered their Anglo-Saxon rivals; and while Ireland and Spain were in the grip of a painful housing crash, most other eurozone economies seemed to have got off relatively lightly.</p> <p>But the longer the crisis has gone on, the more the economic outlook for Europe has darkened. And over the past fortnight, as US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has battled to win legislators' approval for his bank rescue plan, any remaining confidence in the resilience of the European financial sector has drained away.</p> <p>A clutch of heavy-hitting European economists, including Willem Buiter, a former member of the monetary policy committee, and Richard Baldwin, director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, sent an open letter to leaders last week, exhorting them to take urgent action to underpin the banking sector. 'If the turmoil produces credit market paralysis, jobs and businesses will be destroyed on a massive scale,' they warned, evoking the spectre of the Great Depression of the Thirties. Already, the Irish economy is technically in recession, having suffered two successive quarters of negative growth, after the rampant property boom that has seen swish apartment blocks rising up on every empty space on the outskirts of Dublin turned to bust. Spain, too, looks set for a sharp downturn as its property bubble bursts.</p> <p>And while Germany, with its powerful manufacturing sector and prudent consumers, initially looked likely to escape the worst effects of the credit crunch, recent business surveys have shown optimism plummeting in the world's biggest exporter. A recent poll by the French newspaper Le Figaro showed that 80 per cent of people believe the country is on the brink of a 'grave economic crisis'.</p> <p>The feeling that a storm brewed on the other side of the Atlantic has swept in to engulf Europe has sparked public outrage and strengthened the elbow of those politicians who have argued for some time that they would like to see, as Winston Churchill put it, 'finance less proud and industry more content'.</p> <p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who yesterday chaired crisis talks in Paris, has made it quite clear where he lays the blame. In a blistering speech to the UN in September, he turned on the deregulated, laissez-faire model which he blames for allowing the credit bubble to run dangerously out of control.</p> <p>'A certain idea of globalisation is biting the dust with the end of a financial capitalism which had imposed its rationale on the whole economy and contributed to corrupting it,' he said. 'The idea of the all-powerful market which wasn't to be impeded by rules or political intervention was mad.' </p> <p>Politicians seeking to make the argument for further deregulation - as Brown did repeatedly in Brussels during his decade as Chancellor - are likely to get short shrift in the years ahead.</p> <p>First, though, politicians must deal with the immediate financial crisis and its broader economic fallout. The European Central Bank has acted decisively throughout to pump huge sums into the financial markets, helping banks to avoid the short-term liquidity problems that were initially the main focus of concern.</p> <p>But over recent weeks, investors' worries have switched to the more threatening issue of whether some banks will face a shortfall of capital and how hard the struggles of the financial sector could hit the rest of the economy.</p> <p>Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, left eurozone interest rates on hold at 4.25 per cent at its regular meeting on Thursday; but he stressed that there were 'exceptionally high levels of uncertainty' in financial markets and added that the risks for future growth in the 15-member zone were 'on the down side'.</p> <p>Jacques Cailloux, European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, says Trichet's comments suggest mounting fears at the ECB's Frankfurt headquarters about the health of the economy. 'The ECB has signalled today that it is prepared to cut rates any time, alone or in a co-ordinated fashion,' he says. 'This volte-face shows that the bank has lost complete confidence in the economic outlook.' Ben May, of Capital Economics, says that what really concerns Trichet and his colleagues, as well as Sarkozy and other European leaders, is the fear that banks will simply turn off the cash taps to ordinary borrowers. 'It would have a dramatic impact on the real economy if we saw the banking sector seizing up and being unable to lend to households and businesses,' he says. </p> <p>There is also rising disquiet about the cost to Europe's taxpayers of propping up one financial domino after another. So far, analysts say the bail-outs will not put too much strain on public finances. 'The relatively modest costs of the bank bail-outs ... are comparatively easy to shoulder,' says Moritz Kraemer, credit analyst at ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's.</p> <p>However, Kraemer warns that in a much longer-lasting economic crisis, few banks would be immune - and the burden on governments could be intense.</p> <p>'The solvency of Western European sovereigns may not be immune to the fall-out from the financial crisis if events take an unexpected dramatic turn toward a depression-like scenario,' he says. In other words, unless the financial sector crisis is resolved successfully before it begins to devastate the rest of Europe's economy, all bets are off.</p>",
  "<p>I never imagined I would live through events like those of the past three weeks. The Western banking system faces disintegration. Economists and policy-makers are at loggerheads over how to intervene to stop the panic that is sweeping the world and inspire sufficient trust for the key money and credit markets to reopen.</p> <p>This is a crisis that has been 30 years in the making - a Gordian knot of libertarian free-market fundamentalism, unregulated globalisation, the collapse of social and political forces committed to fairness, the explosive impact of financial innovations such as 'securitisation', and sheer greed. Each has contributed to the fiasco - and all now need to be unravelled if the economy is to have a sustained recovery.</p> <p>In the Seventies, there was a revolution born of a free-market belief that inflation and low growth were the consequence of too much state action - too much public spending, too much taxation, too much union power and toomuch money being printed. Instead we would rely on what Ronald Reagan once called the 'magic of the market'. Governments should balance their books and let companies, banks and workers make their own decisions liberated by free markets. Thus stagflation would be bested.</p> <p>Some of this made sense. Nationalised industries were not especially well run, some highly unionised industries such as printing and cars suffered low productivity, and governments had become too addicted to running budget deficits. Challenging the shibboleths of the Seventies was long overdue, and over the Eighties it began to produce some results - lower inflation and more growth.</p> <p>And then the Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the revolution hardened into something more dangerous - an ideological commitment to the view that government regulation had no place whatever in the economy. The left critique of capitalism - that markets delivered instability, booms and busts, monopoly and gross inequity that paradoxically undermined the values of integrity and trust that bind markets together - was proven wrong. Thereshould not even be a mixed economy between private and public sectors. The job was to enlarge the role of markets.</p> <p>In the United States this would manifest itself in Newt Gingrich's 'Contract with America' that gave free licence to the anti-tax, anti-government, pro-deregulation instincts of an increasingly fervent Republican party. That wasn't all. The financial markets were exploiting the new freedoms to insist that governments did Republican things. The Bush presidency sealed the market fundamentalists' victory.</p> <p>This was manna from heaven for the City of London, desperate to recover its place as the fulcrum on which the British economy pivoted. Ditching the gold standard in 1931 had dealt it a harsh blow. Controls directed cheap finance into industry throughout the Depression and into the war. The City hated it, but, by 1951, 20 years of 'proud finance being humbled', as Winston Churchill had put it, had prompted Britain's partial reindustrialisation.</p> <p>Despite its troubles, the City of London remained the apex of Britain's social structure throughout this period. This is to where the privately educated, Oxbridge professionals in law, accounting and banking commuted from their large Home Counties houses to practise 'gentlemanly capitalism' - a capitalism that does not focus on manufacture, science and technology, but on property, international lending, deals and the trading of financial securities. It provided a good living in the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, but London had ambitions. North Sea oil created the balance of payments surpluses that would allow the incoming Tory government to lift controls. The way was open for London to combine with New York to become the centre of world finance. </p> <p>The regulations that inhibited London's development were progressively eliminated. 'Big Bang' in 1986 allowed the brokers and jobbers on London's stock market to be bought up by American, European and Japanese investment banks so they could do in London what was outlawed in New York by Roosevelt's Glass-Steagall Act, introduced in the aftermath of the credit crunch that caused the Great Depression. They could manage huge investment funds, trade in any kind of financial security both on their own account and for clients, advise on deals and act as large banks - all under the same roof despite the conflicts of interest that were prohibited in New York. London began to rise in the league tables of international finance. The foundations of Anglo-American financial capitalism were being laid - and with them the seeds of its own demise.</p> <p>In the early Nineties came a breakthrough that would transform the financial landscape. Goldman Sachs took the concept hitherto used by mortgage companies of packaging up mortgage payments and selling them as a financial security and applied it to an Arizona trailer park. The site pledged its income to a new company, specially set up, which then issued securities - backed by Goldman. The market bought them. 'Securitisation' took off: there are more than $8 trillion of securities backed by a weird and wonderful range of income streams. America, followed rapidly by Britain, did not have to worry that it did not save enough to support its borrowing ambitions; it could sell these securities to all comers from all over the world - especially in Asia and to China's central bank - to finance ambitions to borrow. </p> <p>And we did. Banks issued bonds allowing huge takeovers. Hedge funds and private equity companies blossomed. Money flowed into residential housing. In 1999, Bill Clinton abolished Glass-Steagall; it was pointless given what was happening in London. New York and London were in an unseemly race to regulate less. And if regulators raised an eyebrow they were told not to worry. The securitised bonds - this packaged income - could always be sold to raise cash; and on top banks took out insurance against the risk of default. </p> <p>Nor should regulators worry if banks directed the investment funds under their management to buy any unsold bonds which might look like a fraudulent conflict of interest; one day they would rise in value. </p> <p> So confident did bank directors become that they authorised their managers to run hidden portfolios of securitised assets offshore in secret tax havens; thus would profits be boosted at no risk. </p> <p>Bonuses grew larger and larger, residential and property prices kept rising, fees from ever-bigger deals became juicier and juicier. And when there were setbacks, such as the dot.com bubble bursting, chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was on hand to flood the markets with cheap money. The free-market fundamentalists seemed to be right. Markets never did make mistakes, financial business kept booming, leverage became astronomical. The ever more extravagant school fees were easily paid and Britain's Home Counties - like New York and the Hamptons - became home to parties of astounding luxury and lifestyles of grotesque opulence. Gentlemanly capitalism became super-gentlemanly capitalism. The Financial Times' How to Spend it magazine is studded with dresses that cost up to \u00a330,000. Private submarines, jets and yachts became the rage. One hedge fund manager I knew considered himself underpaid at $200m for one year's work. </p> <p>There was no effective opposition. The left and organised labour collapsed as intellectual, social and political forces; there was no conviction that any alternative to this shareholder value-driven, financial, 'securitised' capitalism existed, or any political muscle to support it even if there were. Mainstream culture moved away from public purpose and fairness; the new priorities were individual self-fulfilment, personal experience and loyalty to self. For example, in the 1990s I fervently opposed the demutualisation of our building societies, built on the values of fairness and collective self-help, arguing that in the interests of pluralism alone we needed a variety of financial institutions to serve the public. They would inevitably try to expand too fast; and inevitably end up being taken over.</p> <p>So it has proved. Every demutualised building society has been taken over. But nobody wanted to listen. The directors wanted the vast personal gains and the members were only scarcely less greedy. In any case, building societies were collective institutions from another age rather like trade unions and no more worth defending. </p> <p>Investment bankers seemed cut from the same cloth as Russian oligarchs and football stars; their fantastic wealth was part of the new order - one that produced growth every year since 1992 and a never-ending rise in house prices. If the rich were getting very rich, ordinary people were not doing badly either. Britain had stumbled on a new social compact.</p> <p>Leader writers of right-wing newspapers could dub the high priests of finance 'wealth generators' without demur - and if any regulator tried to limit their operations, the world would fall on their head. When Tony Blair flirted with the stakeholder capitalism that I proposed in The State We're In for a few weeks early in 1996, his colleagues, especially Gordon Brown , were appalled. The idea would upset the new gods in the City of London, and in any case was wrong because it challenged the free-market orthodoxies. The only way New Labour could win and govern was to accept the Thatcherite settlement, and try to promote social justice within those constraints. And so the madnesses became rocket-propelled.</p> <p>And now the roof has fallen in, setting up potentially the most dangerous vicious circle since the Great Depression - and it could be most vicious of all here in Britain. The belief that securitised loans could always be sold or insured has proved illusory. Worse, too many have junk assets as security - commercial property, buy-to-let property, junk American loans and overstretched buyers in the residential property market. The debt will stay toxic until the economy recovers again. But worse, the margins on any new loans the banks could offer are tiny or non-existent. They have dried up, and as a result the price of property is collapsing, so that the debt is becoming even more toxic. Because everybody knows this, and nobody trusts anybody else, the banks are in a trap.</p> <p>Should the taxpayer shore up the banks' core capital to give them capacity to lend? Or should the taxpayer buy toxic debt, as the American Paulson plan proposes, and release the banks from their crippling, if self-inflicted, burden? And if so, would toxic debt from every international bank registered in London be included? In addition, should there be some form of government-sponsored insurance to support new lending? So far the British government is committed to a case-by-case, go-it-alone approach in which risking taxpayers' money is seen as an instrument of the last resort. In Japan that approach left the country saddled with zombie banks that devastated its economy for a decade. Britain's refusal to drop the laissez-faire ideology risks both that fate and a complete financial seizure in the interim.</p> <p>Yet despite the government's instincts, we have nationalised \u00a3150bn of bank assets in Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 and last week effectively nationalised the money markets. The Bank of England has been forced to step in as a sort of ringmaster, now lending more than \u00a3100bn to banks under its special liquidity scheme, and another \u00a3100bn-plus because banks will not lend to one another. But despite this \u00a3350bn of public support, the money markets remain frozen while ordinary savers move their cash to safe havens such as National Savings, Premium Bonds, Northern Rock and Irish banks. Credit flows are dwindling to nothing. Unless there is a reversal, there will be a major economic recession \u2013 even a slump.</p> <p>The problem is that panics occur because of the primeval desire to protect oneself and one's own. The fear feeds on itself, and unless some major event brings everyone to their senses it will grow . This panic is international. What transfixed London on Tuesday was less what had happened in Britain \u2013 the necessary and inevitable action on Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 but the failure of the US House of the Representatives to pass the Paulson plan. Meanwhile, bank collapses required public bail-outs in France, Holland, Iceland, Belgium and Germany. Then came the Irish guarantee of every deposit in its banks.</p> <p>The Irish 'beggar thy neighbour' policy shocked Europe; such an extreme response could only have been prompted by the potential collapse of a bank. Ireland had jumped straight to the last resort policy of a blanket deposit guarantee, potentially forcing the whole of Europe to follow in fear of losing deposits to Dublin's secure accounts. The need for better European collaboration could not be better dramatised, and yesterday's Paris summit called by President Sarkozy, expected to limit such a Dutch auction in deposit guarantees, is a start. Eurosceptics in Number 10 and the Tory party may wish otherwise \u2013 but Britain alone does not have the muscle to support the vast international financial centre that is the City of London. British bank assets are five times British GDP \u2013 let alone the assets of international banks domiciled here.</p> <p>We are as vulnerable as Iceland, Switzerland and Ireland, as one top financial regulator told me. We need Europe. If the scale of the threat is obvious, so is the opportunity. A political fortune awaits the government that seizes the opportunity to rebuild the delinquent casino that is the British financial system, and around different principles \u2013 a long-term commitment to building businesses, support for investment and innovation, and fairness. Anglo-Saxon capitalism may have delivered a 10-year boom, but the price has been savagely high. Now there is a once-in- 50-years opportunity to create new institutions, new practices and new incentives. If Gordon Brown and his government eschew it they will deserve to be trounced at the general election, and then have to live with having passed up the golden opportunity of their lives.</p> <p>Talking of making bankers pay for the mess they have created, as they do in America over the Paulson plan, is pointless. The task now is to survive without a slump \u2013 and create a new financial system that moves decisively away from the mores of super gentlemanly capitalism.</p> <p>We have to mimic the Paulson plan and set up a so-called 'bad' bank, with up to \u00a3100bn of purchasing power. We must buy toxic loans from all British-based banks, with the object of selling them in better market conditions. Most such operations, as in Sweden in the Nineties or Britain in the Seventies, end up losing no money whatever. This will stop the banks becoming zombie institutions.</p> <p>Second, we have to reopen the markets in securitised assets. This requires two initiatives. The taxpayer will have to find \u00a350bn-plus to invest in the shares of our leading banks so there is no doubt they are solvent and can support both the existing level of debt and the new issue of more. The taxpayer should also give an additional stimulus by running a temporary insurance scheme so that overseas and domestic buyers of securitised loans know there is no risk of losing any money \u2013 in other words, a form of targeted and temporary deposit insurance.</p> <p>The government will become the biggest single shareholder in the financial system. It can require the banks to behave differently \u2013 to move from financing casino capitalism to productive enterprise. There can be a new emphasis on relationship building and offering cheap long-term loans to business. We should create a long-term investment bank. Investment banking and commercial banking should be split, reinforced by a British Glass Steagall Act. The British vogue for takeover can be constrained.</p> <p>The regulatory regime must be overhauled; never again should regulators turn a blind eye to off shore banking and wild ratios in which lending can reach 30 or 40 times a bank's capital. EU and American regulators need to work much more closely \u2013 and Britain needs to be part of the process. The UK taxpayer does not have the firepower to support a bust international system \u2013 one of the reasons that Brown's reluctance to consider a joint European initiative is shortsighted. We may even have to consider joining the euro to get the necessary financial power behind London.</p> <p>A 30-year experiment has come to an end. The world of go-getting investment banks has gone forever. The danger is that we go from feast to famine; debt remains a vital element in any economy, and if we too suddenly try to live without it we will crush ourselves economically. What we are witnessing is a system failure that requires a systemic response \u2013 the creation of a new system that sponsors a fairer, more productive capitalism in its place, while maintaining high flows of credit and debt.</p> <p>This is a terrifying moment; but it is also our generation's once- in-a-lifetime chance to change British capitalism. Brown has an awesome responsibility to his party and his country. I hope he rises to the challenge.</p>",
  "<h2>What happened when The Observer's Laura Potter attempted to find the ingredients and cook a dish from the Blumenthal cookbook ...</h2> <p>Should I go for the bacon and egg ice-cream? Pah, which of us hasn't cooked a recipe containing 24 egg yolks? I plumped instead for a maltodextrin DE19-infused sardine on toast sorbet. </p> <p>First stop: Tesco. Sardines: check. Milk: check. Maltodextrin DE19: hmm. I scoured the 'home baking' aisle to no avail. Google had informed me this elusive ingredient was a 'sweet to taste hygroscopic powder ... creamy white in colour' created by the 'partial hydrolysis of starch'. A tub of rice pudding it is, then. Next testing ingredient: malic acid. Turns out this is nothing more than an alias for E296, so I substituted a bag of strawberry laces - malic acid does, after all, feature ninth in their ingredients list. </p> <p>The cooking was surprisingly hassle-free but rancid smelling. It took an hour and a quarter of toasting, soaking, simmering and blitzing to create what looked like a sardine smoothie. I guessed how many melted strawberry laces would achieve the prescribed PH 5.6. The proof would be in the tasting. </p> <p>Next morning my housemate begrudgingly accepted the challenge. Her verdict: 'Putrid.' After reaching for something, anything, to banish the taste from her palate, she asked the all-important question 'when the hell are you supposed to eat that stuff?' </p> <p>Well, Heston?

  "<h2>Stage one: 1899-1929 <br>The capitalism of modernity</h2> <p>In 1899, the economy, still reliant on horse, wind and steam power, would still just have been recognisable to a Greek or Roman; by 1929 the modern age had been launched. Over 30 years the automobile, the aeroplane, the radio, the skyscraper, the ocean liner and a whole range of domestic electrical appliances emerged as astonishing new artefacts. Modernity had been launched. Although from 1914 Europe was to be mired in war and subsequent recession, Edwardian England shared in the early growth, which culminated in America's Roaring Twenties. The dollar challenged sterling; the European empires, led by the British, inexorably declined before the dazzling technological, industrial and financial might of America.</p> <p><strong>Voice of the times</strong> The Great Gatsby</p> <p>'Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.' </p> <p>'One thing's sure and nothing's surer. The rich get richer and the poor get - children.'</p> <p>\u2022 The Great Gatsby, published in 1925, was F Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the 'Jazz Age', America's short-lived era of prosperity and decadence.</p> <h2>Convulsion one: 1929-1933 <br>The Great Depression </h2> <p>Wall Street ran riot, enthusing that the boom would never end and that share prices would never fall. Levels of debt, leverage and of so-called margin trading (buying shares with borrowed money) rose to astonishing levels - fuelling yet more demand and more confidence. But, partly because recession-hit Europe could not pay its international bills with the gold that was the anchor of the financial system and partly because the banks were overstretched, suddenly optimism turned to wariness - and then panic. Stocks were sold; depositors hoarded their cash; and banks toppled in the United States and Europe like ninepins.</p> <p>This was the father and mother of credit crunches. The US fell into depression - and Europe was not immune. Britain left the gold standard and launched the imperial preference system of tariffs for countries in the British empire.</p> <p><strong>Voice of the times</strong> The Grapes of Wrath</p> <p>'The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It's the monster. Men made it, but they can't control it ... Fella in business got to lie an' cheat, but he calls it somepin else ... You go steal that tire an' you're a thief, but he tried to steal your four dollars for a busted tire. They call that sound business.'</p> <p>\u2022 John Steinbeck's classic, published in 1939, chronicles the plight of the Midwest's working classes during the Depression.</p> <h2>Stage two: 1933-73 <br>Managed capitalism </h2> <p>First recovery from slump, then war, and then postwar reconstruction, forced the state to have a close hand in the capitalist economy. The financial system in Europe and America was tightly regulated and funds were directed to industry. Trade was managed by tariffs. Government planners directed taxpayers' funds to build infrastructure. Industries were managed by government departments.</p> <p>Governments stimulated demand by actively lowering interest rates and enlarging their deficits. Inflation was controlled by price and income policies. During the Fifties and Sixties there was a long boom in both Europe and the United States as mass consumer-goods markets developed.</p> <p><strong>Voice of the times</strong> Harold Macmillan </p> <p>'Indeed let us be frank about it - most of our people have never had it so good. Go around the country, go to the industrial towns, go to the farms and you will see a state of prosperity such as we have never had in my lifetime - nor indeed in the history of this country.'</p> <p>\u2022 Macmillan was Conservative Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.</p> <h2>Convulsion two: 1973-1979 <br>Oil shocks and stagflation</h2> <p>Europe's economic rise created an economic power block to challenge the United States and much greater demand for raw materials. In 1973 the US was unable to sustain the convertibility of dollars into gold, as powerful new European economies demanded. So it killed off the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates between currencies that had been introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, whose dissolution had begun in 1971. Then Arab nations exploited the world oil shortage and quadrupled the price.</p> <p>The world collapsed into both recession and inflation. The international monetary system had been eviscerated. Britain had to borrow from the International Monetary Fund in 1976 and union power was demonstrated by the winter of discontent in 1978-79. Managed capitalism no longer worked. New rules were needed - which were supplied by President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p><strong>Voice of the times</strong> Sun headline</p> <p>'Crisis? What crisis?'</p> <p>\u2022 The infamous words were the creation of a Sun headline writer, not the words of Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan. His actual summary of the situation on his return from an economic conference was: 'I don't think other people in the world would share the view [that] there is mounting chaos.'</p> <h2>Stage three: 1979-2008 <br>The long boom, globalisation and rise of Anglo-Saxon capital</h2> <p>Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan set about removing the controls and regulations that had been put in place over the previous 40 years. Union power was curbed, state-owned enterprises privatised, price and income policies scrapped, top tax rates lowered and regulation of the financial system progressively dismantled.</p> <p>After 1989 the pace of marketisation began to accelerate. The collapse of the Soviet Union made the capitalist world yet more confident that, far from being on the wrong side of history, as seemed likely in 1933, it was the victor. Countries around the world started to adopt democratic capitalism as their model and to open their economies; globalisation was born. A startling new array of technologies permitted ever-more sophisticated and instantaneous communication - the internet, the mobile phone, the personal computer - transforming economic and social possibilities. The dotcom bubble resulted.</p> <p>But the fastest change was in finance. Financial flows and transactions, freed from controls and exploiting the opportunity to trade, grew exponentially. Markets in new financial products mushroomed. As in the Twenties, levels of debt, leverage and margin trading grew to extraordinary levels. By 2007 it began to seem that the boom would never end.</p> <p><strong>Voice of the times</strong> Gordon Gekko</p> <p>'The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms: greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind.'</p> <p>\u2022 Gekko was the main character in Oliver Stone's 1987 film Wall Street.</p> <h2>Convulsion three: 2008-? <br>The world financial system is in meltdown</h2> <p>A lack of effective regulation; too much debt; too little capital; too much greed -all these factors combined to trigger a chain reaction among the world's overstretched banks.</p> <p>Is it possible that history will repeat itself? It looks ever more likely that, again, we will see recession - and then a period of managed capitalism. The old order is once again giving way to another.</p> <p><strong>Voice of the times:</strong> George W Bush</p> <p>'If money isn't loosened up, this sucker [the US economy] is going to go down.'</p> <p>\u2022 The President pleading with Congress last month for the passing of a $700bn bail-out funded by the taxpayer.</p>",
  "<p>A colleague recently told me that one of his friends had persuaded his children not to go to university, on the grounds that a degree wouldn't make up for the debt they would be burdened with by the end of their course.</p> <p>This is a terrifying view to take. Up to now, statistics have shown that the financial benefits of most degrees easily outweigh the fees and living costs incurred. But in the future I have no doubt more people will have the same attitude. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten, called last week for the cap on university tuition fees to be raised, and preferably scrapped. He targeted middle-class parents, claiming they spend thousands of pounds on private-school fees and should be prepared to find more money for their children's university education. </p> <p>He can afford to make this argument - more than half the students at his university are privately educated. As a middle-class parent who struggles and makes compromises to pay private school fees, I think his argument is illogical and unfair.</p> <p>The idea that any student, regardless of background, should face higher tuition fees is wrong. While students can apply for means-tested grants for maintenance, there is no similar help for tuition fees. Families are already being deterred by the cost of higher education. How many more will be if tuition fees go up?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.insley@observer.co.uk\">j.insley@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>A growing number of ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers in the Palestinian West Bank are threatening Israel's security, according to the military chief responsible for their protection in the occupied territory. Major-General Gadi Shamni, whose role includes stopping Palestinian attacks and protecting Jewish settlements in the West Bank, said the rising level of violence from militant settlers is 'impairing our ability to carry out missions in the territories'.</p> <p>He said that the number of extremists who attack Palestinians, Israeli soldiers, police and left-wing activists had grown from a core of a 'few dozen' troublemakers to at least several hundred. </p> <p>'We are forced to divert our attention elsewhere,' said Shamni in an interview published in Haaretz newspaper. 'These are fringe elements that are gaining support because of the tail wind they enjoy and the backing afforded by certain parts of the leadership, both rabbinical and public, whether in explicit statements or tacitly.'</p> <p>His comments follow the attack on a high-profile critic of the settlements, Professor Zeev Sternhell, a Holocaust survivor and expert on fascism. Sternhell was injured a week ago after a pipe bomb exploded at the entrance to his house in Jerusalem. Police found posters in Sternhell's neighbourhood offering a 1.1m shekel (\u00a3180,000) reward to anyone who killed a member of Peace Now, an Israeli group that campaigns against settlements in the West Bank. </p> <p>Israel's politicians, the police and Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency, were swift to blame the extreme fringes of the right. 'An evil streak of radicalism, malice, hatred and disregard of state law is threatening Israeli democracy,' Israel's outgoing Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, said after the attempt to kill Sternhell. </p> <p>A recent UN report documented 222 attacks in the first half of this year, against a total of 291 for the whole of last year. On Friday, the former mayor of a West Bank settlement, Daniella Weiss, was charged with assaulting police officers. She allegedly hit police who had arrived at her house to search for suspects accused of setting fire to a Palestinian-owned olive grove. </p> <p>Settlers said that the arrests were part of a 'witch-hunt' in the aftermath of the attack on Sternhell and claim that the attacks are carried out in self-defence. </p> <p>Last month, after a Palestinian entered a Jewish settlement, burnt a house and stabbed a boy, dozens of settlers raided a nearby Palestinian village, throwing stones, firing guns into the air, breaking windows, damaging property and daubing the Star of David on the walls of homes. </p> <p>Tactics such as burning orchards, blocking roads, rioting and stoning have become a routine part of the settlers' arsenal in their attacks on Palestinians. Police and soldiers are also being targeted amid lingering bitterness after clashes between the settlers and security forces when Israel removed its settlements from Gaza in 2005. </p> <p>The settlers' aim is to deter the government from dismantling settlements in the West Bank, which Israel could be required to give up if a peace deal is struck with the Palestinians. </p> <p>Elyakim Haetzni, a founding father of the settler movement, warned of civil war if Israel attempted to remove more settlements from the West Bank. He said that about 100,000 Israelis were ready to fight for the land. 'Every clash between the settlers and the police, the police get a beating and the army doesn't want to be involved any more. A great number of them are religious,' he said. </p> <p>Israel's vice-premier, Haim Ramon, warned last week that much of the ongoing violence appears to be conducted with impunity. 'The government is standing by scared and unable to act,' Ramon said. 'Had these people been Palestinians, they would all have been behind bars by now.' </p> <p>Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, calculated that only 10 per cent of 205 cases in which Palestinians complained to the police about a settler attack had resulted in indictments. </p> <p>B'Tselem, another Israeli human rights group to raise concerns about growing settler violence this year, said: 'When Palestinians attack Israelis, the authorities invoke all means at their disposal to arrest the suspects. When Israeli civilians attack Palestinians, the Israeli authorities employ an undeclared policy of leniency and compromise toward the perpetrators.' </p> <p>Sternhell, who won this year's Israel Prize, an annual award to mark the country's independence day, despite a High Court challenge by settlers, says that Israel's 'politicians must declare war on the extreme right and occupation'.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to put on a stone (6.3kg) in weight, this is the cookbook for you. Retailing at an astonishing \u00a3100, Heston Blumenthal's lavish new volume of recipes registers more than 12lb on the bathroom scales. And that is without its silver, duck feather-embossed box.</p> <p>What may be the most exclusive cookbook ever produced goes on sale this month, featuring 516 pages of fabulously photographed, jewel-like dishes that bear as much relation to the cuisine of the nation as Vivienne Westwood's clothes do to those on the rails at Next. These are not recipes for those with a modest galley kitchen either, since the book is almost as wide as a standard-sized hob. </p> <p>According to members of the public who were among the first to look into the tome's mysteries this weekend, Blumenthal, who is famed for his outr\u00e9 experiments with the scent and sound of eating, needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Its esoteric contents are best summed up by one bemused woman who, after flicking through the first edition, wondered: 'Where would you get 250g of spinalis dorsi?'</p> <p>Yet the book is arguably a democratic move from Britain's most avant-garde gastronome. For \u00a3100 you can sample at home the food on the menu at the restaurant that is repeatedly judged the best in Britain, The Fat Duck at Bray in Berkshire. This is a fraction of the cost of an average bill at Blumenthal's triple-Michelin-starred headquarters, famed for its 18-course tasting menu. Perhaps it is a bargain then, assuming that your kitchen is already equipped with an atomiser, a vacuum chamber and a laboratory-style centrifuge. </p> <p>Before Blumenthal opened the Fat Duck in 1995, he had spent only one week working at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, but his extraordinary culinary theories have swept the country. In 2004 he opened his own research and development kitchen, pursuing the kind of alchemy behind two of his trademark dishes, smoked bacon and egg ice-cream and snail porridge. His concentration on extracting intense flavours from his ingredients, however long and arduous the procedures involved, has seen him dubbed 'the emperor of molecular gastronomy'. For scientific know-how at the stove, he is rivalled only by his friend Ferran Adri\u00e0 of the renowned El Bulli restaurant in Spain.</p> <p>At a time when celebrity chefs are identified, much like rock stars, by their first names alone, Heston's magnum opus will be up against new recipe books from Nigella, Jamie, Rick and Gary this Christmas. But while all his competitors' titles will have high production values, Blumenthal's qualifies as a piece of conceptual art. You would not want to accidentally drip it with glucose syrup or Sicilian mandarin essential oil.</p> <p>Among the other unlikely ingredients listed in the book are spray-dried carrot powder, maltodextrin DE19, yellow pectin and golden frankincense tears for making reserved frankincense hydrosol.</p> <p>So that's the science part over, though Blumenthal would probably claim its importance has been over-emphasised by his critics. Two years ago he launched a manifesto in collaboration with Adri\u00e0 and a third top international chef, Thomas Keller, to try to clarify his key principles. The point of his work, he said, is not the technical wizardry itself but the search for flavour. 'The danger is that technology overtakes the value of the dish,' Blumenthal said.</p> <p>The 42-year-old cook argues that evoking the nostalgia of early taste experiences is crucial to enjoying food. The new book explains how he developed a vegetable dish that reminded him of childhood breakfasts.</p> <p>'We began crystallising pieces of parsnip to make them look like a breakfast cereal that could be served with a jug of parsnip milk,' he writes.</p> <p>Truly more like a coffee table than a coffee table book, this publication is not a practical aid for the busy cook.</p> <p>'It could be much smaller and have an additional book, with all the design material,' said Nicola Daniel, 29, an undergraduate course officer from Wembley, north-west London. 'Why would you buy such a huge book for such a huge price?'</p> <p>Robin Syred, 29, an office manager from Balham, south London, agreed about the size. 'You wouldn't want to get it messy,' he added.</p> <p>Mohamed El Sayed, 42, a chef from Archway, north London, and his fellow chef, 39-year-old Dominique Ait El Manceur from Charlton, south-east London, both agreed it was impractical. 'It looks like a nice encyclopaedia,' said El Manceur. Curator Eline van der Vlist, the woman who wondered where she would find spinalis dorsi, thought the cookbook looked more like an art catalogue.</p> <p>Jamie Gavin, 25, a press analyst from Islington, north London, said: 'It is very aesthetically pleasing and the book is a commodity in itself, but you could get the same information on the internet for free. It is too expensive.'</p> <p>Even with his hot temper and reported love of kickboxing, Blumenthal will now find it hard to control the free exchange of his kitchen secrets. A cheap click of the mouse is going to appeal to many of his fans more than the thought of paying \u00a3100 to lug home The Big Fat Duck Cookbook. In fact, since the chef is thought to have been forced to give up his favourite sport after a back operation, it is probably best if even he doesn't try to pick it up without some help.</p> <p>\u2022 Heston Blumenthal's <strong>The Big Fat Duck Cookbook</strong> is published by Bloomsbury, price \u00a3100.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/04/foodanddrink.hestonblumenthal\">Food blog: Who will buy Heston's weighty tome?<br></a></p>",
  "<p>Barrow, the Cumbrian town forged through the toil of iron, steel and shipyard workers, has been named the most working-class place in the UK.</p> <p>The port community on the tip of the Furness peninsula is a class apart, it seems, when it comes to displaying true blue-collar credentials, according to a new survey. But the title is not earned through its historic past at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. Rather, it has been awarded for its preponderance of chippies, bookies and workingmen's clubs. The survey, by the local directory website <a href=\"http://www.locallife.co.uk\">locallife.co.uk</a>, identified that the industrial town has a fish-and-chip shop, workingmen's club, bookmaker, greyhound track or trade union office for every 2,917 people.</p> <p>Mayor Dave Roberts said Barrow was 'extremely proud' of its new status, but a little bemused to find itself 'defined by chip shops and bookmakers' rather than its manufacturing heritage. 'It does seem to depict us in flat caps with whippets coming out of the betting shops,' he said. 'I've been looking out, and I've yet to see one flat cap - or a whippet.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, Val Holden, Barrow's regeneration officer, who confessed she was practising her 'Ee bah gumming', spied a business opportunity. 'We could flog Barrow as a museum of working-class life. I can imagine us sitting in our juice bars watching visiting toffs try out our \"meat and tattie pie experience\". Those looking for flat caps might be disappointed, though. Years ago, when the Vickers shipyard buzzer went, 14,000 flat caps used to pack the bridge from Barrow island into town, and it was a sight to see. Now the flat caps have gone, along with most of the shipyard workers.</p> <p>'But we've got two golf clubs, three yacht clubs nearby, a flying club, gliding club, two riding clubs, we're the gateway to the Lakes and we have a beautiful beach, which I am just about to walk along in my lunch hour. So, working-class life? I recommend it.' </p> <p>'It is difficult to define working class,' said philosopher Dr Julian Baggini, author of Welcome to Everytown, a study of cultural England. 'Chip shops are usually regional. Gambling is widespread, though the working class are more likely to visit a traditional bookies than gamble online. Workingmen's clubs? That's quite a crude measure. Some industries, like iron, steel and shipbuilding, are much more unionised so have more clubs, but that doesn't make them more working-class.</p> <p>'I think it's really defined by a sense of being of a community, of a background, being a respectable, hard-working, no-nonsense person with no time for pretensions. Essentially, people are now still working class, but with more money.'</p> <p>Indeed, John Prescott, the former Deputy Prime Minister, may have famously declared 'We're all middle-class now', but he appears to be in the minority. In 1964, 66 per cent of people identified themselves as working class; by 2005 it was 58 per cent, a small decline over 40 years.</p> <p>Ironically, Barrow used to boast more wealthy aristocracy than most places. Its riches-to-rags story began when, in the 1870s, the Furness Railway allowed iron ore to be transported for smelting and the export of steel. Its deep harbour allowed the locally produced steel to be put to another use - shipbuilding - and it became a significant producer of naval vessels. But the end of the Cold War and defence cutbacks led to high unemployment. Today the health authority is the largest employer and regeneration grants have transformed the town. A \u00a3200m waterfront development will incorporate marina, business park and housing scheme, marking Barrow out as one of the most progressive towns in the north-west, according to Mayor Roberts. 'There's a lot more to Barrow than fish and chips,' he said. 'And we don't have a greyhound track.' </p> <p>Tony Martin, chairman of <a href=\"http://www.locallife.co.uk\">locallife.co.uk</a>, admits: 'It's not an entirely serious study. We felt these were the categories that would give a steer in terms of the interaction of working-class life.' </p> <p>But Dr Gillian Evans, a lecturer in social anthropology at Manchester University, said: 'The indicators of social class here are obviously tongue-in-cheek but nevertheless telling about a way of life associated with working-class communities - a way of life about which people often feel fiercely proud. A more conventional classification would be based on the socio-economic status of its residents.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, Eddie Maloney, who owns Andy's fish and chip bar, believes his product is classless. 'I've been here 20 years and it's not true that fish and chips is a working-class diet. We get all classes in here and from all over Cumbria,' he said. </p> <p>He did, however, have a theory on how Barrow's 72,000 population could sustain 13 chip shops: a captive market. 'We're out on a limb. They call it the longest cul-de-sac in the world. You come off the motorway and it's 33 miles into Barrow, and 33 miles back out again, and there really isn't anywhere else to go.'</p>",
  "<p>The familiarity of source will not diminish the pain of one more boot to the Arsenal cranium. Roy Keane used to do his damage more directly, studs and sinews propelled into north London opponents when the moment required it. Here his weapons were inspiration and insight, preparing his Sunderland team to unsettle, upset and, ultimately, deprive the visitors of two points.</p> <p>Arsenal's inconsistency continues. Convincing victors in midweek Champions League action, it is either feast or famine with this team. To defeats by Fulham and Hull City, add this barely recovered draw at the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>The goals came late. First, substitute Grant Leadbitter took advantage of Alexandre Song's laxity to leather a strike off the underside of the Arsenal crossbar and over the line. Then, a minute of added time remained when Cesc F\u00e1bregas's emphatic near-post header spared the visitors defeat. If Arsenal could justifiably claim another goal - an errant line call depriving them of an opener - this was a result that always looked possible as Sunderland smothered and countered, and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's men dropped a distance off their best.</p> <p>'Is it a good point or a bad point? I don't know,' Wenger said. 'But it was a frustrating day for us because we didn't create the chances we usually do and Sunderland defended very well. They just focused on defending. I like to think the team that takes the initiative should be rewarded, but it's not always like that in football.'</p> <p>It was a suggestion that went down poorly with Keane, who was happy to excuse his team the lack of awareness that cost them a three-point haul, but would not accept the criticism of his game plan. 'I have to look at the squad of players available and, for today, that was a good option for us,' he said. 'We've played Arsenal last year, Chelsea and United here, played 4-4-2 and got beaten 4-0; could have been seven. We have to get the balance right of our own team. Maybe Ars\u00e8ne Wenger should focus on his team. Part of the game is breaking down the opposition.'</p> <p>Keane's reshaped side was impressively resilient. Having given El-Hadji Diouf the predictable chop for jumping out of the way of a net-bound Aston Villa free-kick last weekend, Keane reconstructed his midfield around Dwight Yorke, trading pace for experience, but congesting the space where Arsenal often do their most dangerous work.</p> <p>Wenger countered by reshaping his attack. Samir Nasri made way for Song as defensive midfielder, F\u00e1bregas pushed into a more advanced role and Robin van Persie was sent to the left wing. In the opening minutes, the Spaniard tried to fine-tune an unusual formation, asking Song and Den\u00edlson to close the gaps to the attacking quartet.</p> <p>With 10 men sitting deep and attempting to release Djibril Ciss\u00e9 on breaks, Sunderland made more early chances. As William Gallas fretted over his footwear, Kolo Tour\u00e9's finely timed tackle stopped Dean Whitehead in the penalty area. Theo Walcott's errant back-pass turned into a through ball for Ciss\u00e9 that ended with a well saved shot. Soon, Ciss\u00e9 was testing the keeper again; holding possession with his back to goal, the Frenchman swivelled around and fired in a shot. Manuel Almunia touched the ball over, but his team-mates were clearly unsettled.</p> <p>Arsenal creation remained limited - F\u00e1bregas long-range shooting and Song heading over from a corner. Still organised in defence, Sunderland were now more confident in their attacking play, neat triangles working the ball forward.</p> <p>Den\u00edlson slid a shot across Craig Gordon's posts, but, again, it came from outside the penalty area - Arsenal were struggling to put a foot on the ball inside it. The refereeing went against Arsenal, too. Walcott finally escaped from Danny Collins by the touchline and cut back the ball for Van Persie, who finished with conviction, only for a linesman's flag to go up. Replays showed Walcott delivered his pass from on the line, not beyond it.</p> <p>'That's just another appeal for video; if the manager had two appeals per game, I would have used it,' said Wenger, without great complaint. Keane simply smiled at his fortune: 'Today I was glad there was no video.'</p> <p>Tackling grew more ragged, yellow cards more frequent, and Wenger attempted a change, placing Nicklas Bendtner on the right of his attack. When that made little difference, the Dane went central and Nasri joined the midfield. As Arsenal returned to a more conventional shape, Steed Malbranque's snap shot almost caught them out.</p> <p>The goal was merely delayed. Song dallied in possession close to his own goal, allowing Leadbitter to gather the ball, sight woodwork and catapult in a shot off its underside. That should have secured Keane's first managerial victory over a Big Four club, but Sunderland conceded a characteristic late goal. Van Persie sent in the corner, F\u00e1bregas's header, from six yards out, was unstoppable. Arsenal, clearly, are not.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Steed Malbranque</p>",
  "<p>Jeremie Aliadi\u00e8re may have clinched the points thanks to his 88th-minute sucker punch, but the acclaim after the match went elsewhere as both managers - and the watching Fabio Capello - marvelled at the heroics of Middlesbrough all-English defence.</p> <p>'I don't think our keeper touched the ball in the whole game, but the way Boro defended was a credit to them, particularly their centre-backs,' conceded Steve Bruce, whose side had lorded it over the visitors for most of the match but rarely found a way past David Wheater and Chris Riggott - and were thwarted by 23-year-old goalkeeper Ross Turnbull on the few occasions they did.</p> <p>'It was a game where the centre-backs were given an opportunity to stand up and do their job,' Gareth Southgate concurred. 'But there were excellent performances right across the back five, particularly by the keeper.'</p> <p>Depleted by injury and drained of confidence, Middlesbrough's squad had been shoved on to the back foot from the outset by their more fluid and robust hosts. Their hopes of claiming a first away victory of 2008 looked forlorn.</p> <p>Wigan's dominance was most obvious in midfield, where Lee Cattermole was teaching the club that reared him a lesson. Cattermole's combativeness subdued Mohamed Shawky and Gary O'Neil and allowed Wilson Palacios to raid forward and dovetail with Emile Heskey and Amr Zaki.</p> <p>Wigan's first clear chance came in the ninth minute when Heskey flicked on a long kick by Chris Kirkland and Antonio Valencia eluded the defenders to collect it. His shot fizzed just wide of the post.</p> <p>Thereafter, Zaki was Wigan's main conduit but, though the Premier League's top scorer exuded confidence, too often his over-eagerness sabotaged his control. He hit a Valencia cross into the side-netting and in the 37th minute he lunged after the ball but instead caught fellow Egyptian Shawky and was booked.</p> <p>Two minutes later, he almost made a more positive impact, receiving the ball after neat interplay by Palacios and Heskey before arrowing a shot towards the top corner. Turnbull excelled to tip it past the post for a corner.</p> <p>Though Wigan continued to control midfield, Wheater and Riggott gradually got a grip on Zaki and Heskey to prevent the home side from penetrating, though the defenders still had to perform a series of last-ditch tackles and clearances.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Turnbull was required to make several more important interventions. In the 80th minute, he performed real acrobatics to hold a shot by Jason Koumas after the substitute had waltzed past four defenders.</p> <p>With five minutes left, Turnbull retrieved a ball in from Daniel de Ridder just before Henri Camara could collect. Then came Aliadi\u00e8re's decisive blow.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> David Wheater</p> <p>With Robert Huth and Emanuel Pogatetz injured, Boro needed their stopper to be dominant and he was. Gradually got hold of Zaki to the extent that the Egyptian was replaced. He even ventured forward to produce one of Boro's best attacking moments.</p>",
  "<p>A goal from Craig Bryson gave <strong>Kilmarnock</strong> a 2-1 victory against <strong>Hearts</strong> at Tynecastle in the contest between the third and fourth placed clubs in the SPL.</p> <p>Killie deservedly took the lead with a stunning free-kick from Mehdi Taouil on 19 minutes. Michael Stewart burst into the penalty area and struck a powerful effort that cannoned off the body of Craig Bryson and fell kindly to the feet of Laryea Kingston, who lashed in the rebound from 10 yards. Bryson snatched the winner with nine minutes remaining, starting the move by picking out substitute Donovan Simmonds before collecting the return pass and sending a low, left-footed shot past Marian Kello.</p> <p>A goal in each half by Derek Riordan cancelled out Lee Miller's equaliser to give <strong>Hibernian</strong> a 2-1 win at <strong>Aberdeen</strong>. An exciting game saw the Dons chasing their first home win of the season, but it was the visitors who capitalised on their willingness to deploy an attacking formation at Pittodrie. </p> <p>Hibs took the lead after 32 minutes when Riordan seized on a slack back pass from Lee Mair before Miller got the home team back on level terms from the spot after he had been fouled by Souleymane Bamba. The Edinburgh side clinched a second consecutive away win after Charlie Mulgrew stopped striker Steven Fletcher's goalbound effort on the line and was sent off by referee Mike McCurry for deliberate handball. Riordan converted the penalty for his second goal of the game and his third since returning from Celtic.</p> <p><strong>Dundee United </strong>captain Lee Wilkie scored for both sides as his in-form side defeated <strong>Inverness Caley</strong> 2-1 at Tannadice. Both sides passed up good first-half opportunities before the home side broke the deadlock. Following a good spell of possession, United seized the advantage in the 40th minute, Jon Daly heading Sean Dillon's right-wing cross into the bottom corner from 12 yards. The home side took control of possession in the second half and Wilkie doubled the lead in the 65th minute. Darren Dods headed Paul Dixon's centre across the six-yard box and his fellow centre-back headed in off the bar. Roy O'Donovan missed a great chance to further the lead when he stabbed Morgaro Gomis' cross just past the far post before Wilkie tainted his day with an own goal in injury time. Craig Levein's team moved into the top half of the SPL after picking up their fourth successive victory in all competitions.</p>",
  "<p>One of the mighty unscaled peaks of athletics lost a little more of its once presumed invincibility last Sunday when Haile Gebrselassie gave the world a glimpse of the first sub two-hour marathon. More than four decades since the sport's last great conquests - Roger Bannister's destruction of the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954 and Jim Hines' breaking 10 seconds for the 100 metres in 1968 - the same lasting legacy achieved by these two men now beckons a long-distance runner. </p> <p>A week ago, Gebrselassie, the Ethiopian runner who would be precious little use in a pub brawl but with a bird-like frame, long stride and voracious oxygen uptake that make him a super-efficient distance runner, surpassed even the high expectations that preceded his run over the fast, flat course in Berlin. His time of two hours three minutes 59 seconds sliced 27 seconds off his own world marathon record and, by breaking through the 2:04 barrier, scattered the clouds that had obscured the sub-two-hour peak. </p> <p>Expert opinion is deeply divided over how long it will take before the summit is reached, and some even remain doubtful whether it ever will be. Plenty of authoritative voices say otherwise, though, none with greater conviction than David Bedford, the former world-record holder for 10,000 metres and now race director of the London Marathon. 'Without doubt I will see a two-hour marathon in my lifetime,' Bedford, who is 58, says. 'It might be towards the end of my life. It might be another 20 years. But, yes, it will definitely happen.' </p> <p>Bud Baldaro, who has been UK Athletics' marathon coach, agrees with Bedford. 'I think it will happen now,' he says. 'They have been getting significantly closer for the past four or five years and I think that in the next 20 years someone who has the running economy and track-running pedigree of Gebrselassie or Kenenisa Bekele [the world 10,000m record holder] will do it.' </p> <p>The doubters include Ron Hill, who in 1970 was probably the first runner to go under the 2hr 10min mark, the only other sub 2:10 time having been over a course now reckoned to have been short of the full distance. He maintains his position despite having once said 2:05 could not be beaten. 'I said that would be the limit before the altitude runners began to show their potential,' Hill says. He also cites pre-race diet, in-race fuel supplies and pacemakers, unheard of in his time, as reasons for the record now being faster than he previously thought possible. </p> <p>Hill might have thrown in the considerable incentive provided by financial rewards. Gebrselassie earned \u00a3102,000 plus an undisclosed appearance fee for his third win in Berlin.</p> <p>Glenn Latimer, one of the world's leading marathon authorities who oversees long-distance running in the United States, is as sceptical as Hill about the likelihood of anyone breaking through the two-hour barrier, describing it as 'a far-off dream'. He was in a lead vehicle watching Gebrselassie run in Berlin last weekend, and says: 'You could tell from Haile's face over the last four or five kilometres that it was hard work. Although his form remained brilliant and he was very smooth, he was showing stress. </p> <p>'If you look at what his splits were, averaging around 14 minutes 45 seconds for each five kilometres, they're amazing. You're talking something else altogether to go down significantly below this.' </p> <p>Latimer says he would be staggered if a time of under two hours were ever recorded. Ever? 'They'd have to invent some very good drugs for it to happen because we know what happens to the body after 30 kilometres. It really starts to suffer and break down.' </p> <p>Gebrselassie, 35, himself a believer in the two-hour marathon - 'Maybe in 20 years, maybe 40 years. The more technology develops, the more athletes will run faster' - reeled off kilometres at between 2min 53.8sec and 2:58.2 as he broke the record he set a year ago in the same race. There have been seven world records in the event - four men's, three women's - whose date in late September more or less guarantees a perfect temperature (this year between 10C at the start and 14C at the finish). 'The course is fast, the weather was perfect and the rain the day before made everything fresh,' Gebrselassie said. 'And the pacemakers were good. You don't often get all these things together.' </p> <p>The luxury of pacemakers referred to enviously by Hill and the unexpectedly strong run by Kenya's James Kwambai, who lowered his personal best by nearly five minutes in finishing second in 2:05:36, were important factors in Gebrselassie's run.</p> <p>Although only one of four pacemakers who were there to ensure a world-record tempo, the Kenyan Abel Kirui, survived the relentlessly high pace beyond 30km, before being dropped at 32km, Kwambai clung on and appeared briefly to be capable of staying with Gebrselassie until the finish. 'Haile looked over and you could see him wondering, \"Who is this guy?\",' Latimer says. Eventually, though, even Kwambai was burned off with just over 5km to go, which had the positive effect of relieving Gebrselassie of having to engage in a tactical battle over the closing stages.</p> <p>With just the clock to beat as the finishing line approached, Gebrselassie wound up the pace to produce his fastest 5km split between the 35km and 40km marker - a savagely quick 14min 29sec - which carried him to his 26th world best, over distances ranging from two miles to the marathon, in 14 years. </p> <p>Put in terms of seconds per kilometre, the task of raising the pace from the one Gebrselassie ran last Sunday to the one that would be needed to complete a two-hour marathon does not seem especially daunting: 2min 55sec pace would have to come down to 2:51. Expressed in terms of distance, though, and a mere four seconds seems very different. It is around 24 metres per kilometre, which would be regarded as a substantial winning margin in a 1,000m race. </p> <p>It is a figure that places Alan Storey, the UK Athletics' senior performance manager, on the side of those who believe two hours for the marathon is, as he puts it, 'somewhere between very unlikely and impossible'. </p> <p>Storey alludes to the old brain-teaser about how many jumps it would take to reach a tree if every time you leapt forward you covered half the distance of your previous jump. The answer is you would never reach the tree. For tree read two-hour marathon and the same answer applies, Storey reasons, to the question of how many attempts it would take to gain those 24 metres per kilometre. </p> <p>'Given all of the science that we have available now, I have seen nothing to suggest another huge improvement could be made,' Storey says. 'If some exercise physiologist discovers something new and exciting then anything could be possible, but given all of the information we know about I don't expect to see two hours broken in my lifetime - and I'm a youthful 63.' </p> <p>Asked about what new and exciting things might be out there, Storey says: 'If I had any idea what they were I'd have people working on them now - under wraps so that we could use them in 2012. No doubt these physiologists are trying to find ways to cope with the stresses of running marathons, but I don't know anybody from a science background who thinks two hours is likely.' </p> <p>David Bedford might not claim to be from a scientific background, but he was an extraordinary runner who lowered the world 10,000m record by 7.6sec in 1973 when he ran 27min 30.80sec, a time that only three British runners have beaten in the 35 years since. He became so addicted to training that he covered more than 200 miles per week. 'It made me incredibly strong,' he says, 'but it also kept me injured a lot of the time.' This is the experience on which he draws to make the argument, contrary to Storey's and others, that it is not whether but when the 120 minutes for the marathon will be breached. </p> <p>Bedford believes it will be achieved simply through what he calls a continuing evolution of times. 'For example,' he says, 'if you take Kenenisa Bekele as the No1 10,000-metre runner at the moment, he is significantly faster than Haile Gebrselassie over the distance - so therefore I believe that when he and his generation move up to the marathon we will start to see times like two hours two-and-a-half minutes or even two hours two minutes. And this will continue. So what I think we are talking about is maybe three generations from now athletes getting it into their heads that it is possible. </p> <p>'You need to look back to the previous most famous barrier, the four-minute mile. For a long time people didn't think it was possible and then all of a sudden one whole generation started to believe it could happen and started to work towards it. But that generation had to be near enough to it to sense that it was possible. </p> <p>'Although Gebrselassie and Bekele are amazing, I don't think their generation of distance runners is close enough to two hours for the marathon to see it as possible. However, they will continue the erosion of times and a future generation, two or three down the line - so you're talking 10 to 15 years - will be the first to run two hours one-and-a-half minutes, or something like that, and will start believing that two hours can be done.' </p> <p>Believing you can break a record as a necessary prerequisite to actually breaking it is something that Tim Noakes, the South African doctor and long-distance runner, has spoken about. In reference to Bannister's four-minute mile, Noakes has said: 'He was able to convince his brain that it could achieve what none had done before.'</p> <p>Bedford backs up his argument by citing the one-hour barrier for the half marathon, which withstood all attempts at it until Moses Tanui of Kenya ran 59min 47sec in Milan on 3 April 1993. Since then Tanui has been joined by 34 others who between them have gone under 60 minutes on a further 69 occasions. 'That again was something that was viewed as not possible,' Bedford says. 'As soon as people start running 55 minutes for a half marathon [the record stands at 58:33], the world will be ready for the first two-hour marathon.' </p> <p>The assumption that a man will be the first to run two hours is not necessarily safe. Bedford, though, forthrightly declares that a woman will not do it for at least 250 years, while Bud Baldaro believes that it will be done by 'someone with a very simple lifestyle'. </p> <p>'Ethiopian and Kenyan runners have shown over the past three decades what can be achieved and I wonder what might come out of Asia and South America when the world changes even more,' Baldaro says. He doubts US or European runners will be involved. 'The Western lifestyle is so complicated and complex now that the guys find it very difficult to sacrifice everything to run 150, 160 miles a week.' </p> <p>As to where the first sub two-hour marathon might be run, Berlin in the autumn is the obvious answer, although Bedford has not given up on London staging the historic event.</p> <p>'Remember that Paula Radcliffe's two-fifteen-twenty-five, which stands above and beyond what anyone else has done in the women's marathon, was done in London,' he says, 'and also Khalid Kannouchi did two-five-thirty-eight in the men's event in 2002. So on the right day London is certainly able to have a world record again.' </p> <p>And could it be that in 20 years' time David Bedford will still be the race director who secures the runner who makes history through the streets of London? 'I think in 20 years' time I will have spent the morning of the marathon in the hospitality tent and the afternoon sound asleep,' Bedford says.</p>",
  "<p>The last time assisted suicide was debated at Westminster, the Bishop of Portsmouth, the Rt Rev Kenneth Stevenson, explained that death is too important to leave to dying people. 'Dying,' said the bishop, disclosing that he had been diagnosed with leukaemia, 'is not an entirely individual matter. It is corporate.' In the case of Debbie Purdy, it could hardly be more so.</p> <p>The whole country now knows that Ms Purdy, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, has thought in detail about when and how she wishes to die. When the pain of her illness becomes intolerable, she would like to have the choice, as the able-bodied do, of taking her own life. For her, physical incapacity may mean that she needs help to do this. Although suicide is legal in Britain, assisting suicide remains a crime which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years.</p> <p>The most recent attempt to reform this law as it relates to terminally ill people, in a bill brought by Lord Joffe, was wrecked in the upper house two years ago after a debate in which successive men and women of faith proclaimed the sanctity of life. Lord Ahmed, for instance, could not countenance dying people, of any description, defying a section of the Koran in which it says: 'Do not kill yourselves. For verily God Almighty has been most merciful to you.'</p> <p>So unless the law is changed before she is in unbearable pain, Ms Purdy will need to arrange her death in conformity with the wishes of God Almighty, as relayed to the House of Lords. 'My dearest wish,' she said last week, 'would be to die with dignity in my own home, with my husband and loved ones around me.' Instead, she will have to travel to Switzerland, to the peripatetic Dignitas facilities, recently located next to a brothel on an industrial estate near Zurich. Here, in exchange for \u00a31,255 (not including services of a doctor, registry, cremation, accompanying visitors etc), she will be handed a lethal dose of barbiturates.</p> <p>But what if Purdy's husband, Omar Puente, helps organises this suicide in Switzerland? Would not that make him her suicide assistant? On this, British law is stubbornly unclear and Ms Purdy would like it, for her husband's sake, to be clarified. 'For 13 years, I've been in love with this man, he's everything to me,' she said, 'and I'm not about to see him take a risk of prosecution.'</p> <p>The fact that there have been no prosecutions to date of the many British family members who must have, one way or another, committed this offence (100 Britons have now died at Dignitas) does not guarantee Puente's immunity. As Ms Purdy implies, when she imputes 'cowardice' to the DPP, the current law is a fudge which has helped prevent the fullest, most open public debate on assisted dying involving, as this would, yet another public battle between secular and religious world views, as well as confrontations with various special interest groups, principally medical bodies, champions of palliative care and those claiming, for some reason, that this law would affect disability rights. When polled, some 80 per cent of the general public supports assisted suicide for the terminally ill.</p> <p>Most of the time, of course, people are not polled about dying and don't sign up for secular, death-related pressure groups. Though popular, apparently, with philosophers, extinction is never a hot topic among those who are young, healthy and yet to be involved with very sick people. One unfortunate consequence of this avoidance is that campaigns for assisted dying remain easy to misrepresent as the natural preserve of creepy - probably nudist - thanatophiles with portable euthanasia machines in the back of their cars. The second is that British law on correct dying still reflects the views of a well-organised but unrepresentative coalition of assisted-suicide opponents.</p> <p>Ms Purdy's case is the latest to inspire the usual, devout suspects to rehearse euthanasia scare stories which conventionally depict some coming holocaust of the weak: 'To allow assisted suicide would place vulnerable people - the sick, elderly, depressed and disabled - under pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death,' says Care Not Killing.</p> <p>In reality, such a law, modelled - as was Lord Joffe's proposal - on Oregon's 1997 Death with Dignity Act, would be much more likely to increase the protection of terminally ill people, by ending the existing confusion whereby some patients receive lethal doses of morphine from doctors, outside the law, while others do not. American research suggests that assisted dying is more common in the states where it is illegal than in Oregon, where the mere possibility of assisted death seems to offer patients a kind of comfort.</p> <p>In this country, such patients have recourse, instead, to the website of the non-profit Dignitas death factory, whose customer base owes so much to the British pro-life movement. Even the most terribly incapacitated people have proved less easy to frustrate, when they choose to order their final moments, than our life-preserving bishops and doctors would wish.</p> <p>In fact, the very ghastliness of the Dignitas Euro-death plant in an anonymous apartment underlines a no less uncompromising belief, on the part of some terminally ill patients, that the moment of their death is too important to be controlled by others, however well-meaning these others might be and however superbly trained to offer palliative care.</p> <p>Not all patients are prepared for utter passivity as their bodies hang on to life; some, indeed, the House of Lords learnt, 'find being cared for intolerable'. What if they cannot afford, or begin to face, the journey to Dignitas? Some will starve themselves to death. Some may find a kindly physician. And some of these moribund miseries, according to several contributors to the Lords debate, actually snap out of it and are jolly glad afterwards that they did!</p> <p>We can never be sure, but it seems unlikely that every dying dissident ultimately reconciles her or himself to submitting, like this, to a corporate death the authorities believe to be appropriate. 'Making someone die in a way that others approve, but he believes a horrifying contradiction of his life,' writes Ronald Dworkin in his brilliant study of abortion and euthanasia, Life's Dominion, 'is a devastating, odious form of tyranny.' Interestingly, however, that committed opponent of state intervention, David Cameron, is all for it: 'I think the long-term consequences of permitting such action are too likely to be dangerous for society,' he said just before Lord Joffe's assisted suicide bill was wrecked.</p> <p>Whether or not Joffe, who has fought heroically for more enlightened laws for the dying, will come back for more, he and his supporters are right to compare this particular struggle for self-determination with earlier campaigns for individual freedom. That we are all, even when in agony and at the very brink of oblivion, subject to the state's faith-based rules on dying, will at least seem as astonishing in future as beating children in schools and obeying orders in childbirth do today.</p> <p>But that the terminally ill should be buying one-way tickets to Zurich in order to protect their close relations from imprisonment surely requires no such perspective. It is barbaric. To stop it, however, the government will have to talk about dying. And so will we.</p>",
  "<p>If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss, not rushing down to the show at Tate Britain, not tuning into the televised ceremony, then 2008 is the ideal year. It is not that the art is wilfully bad - that would at least imply energy - it is just that it is almost entirely inactive. Compared to the roaring Nineties, where everything jostled and shrieked and poked you in the eye, stirring a response one way or another, this year feels bloodless, academic and quiet. </p> <p>The shortlist is unusually international, not just in its choice of artists - Goshka Macuga is Polish, Runa Islam is Bangladeshi - but in the shows for which the artists were nominated. Bergen, Dijon, Oslo, Cologne (and Milton Keynes): I think we can all agree that none of us is likely to have seen more than one of these supposedly enthralling events. It is often whispered that the judges haven't either, of course, and that the show at Tate Britain may be their first real opportunity to contemplate the work of all four artists in any depth. </p> <p>I doubt that this is the case in 2008 - the members of the judging panel are well respected European curators and journalists, and as widely travelled as contemporary art professionals have to be in today's back-to-back biennale circuit. But something else has now become a certainty. Tate Britain can stop pretending that the public's nominations count for anything since these can hardly be the shows we proposed in our written nominations, unless we too are all European art professionals.</p> <p>Two other points about this year's prize: the show is being held in the museum's basement instead of the main floor, which feels apt since the prize itself is surely beginning to decline as any kind of front-page outrage. The tabloids are not likely to puff themselves up like furious bullfrogs over Islam's careful little films or the old-fashioned kitchen sink installations of Cathy Wilkes, Macuga's recherch\u00e9 photomontages or the passionate enthusiasm of Mark Leckey for cinema and the art of Philip Guston. The sensational years are over.</p> <p>But it is rumoured that there was furore among the artists themselves about who should have which rooms of the gallery and in which order of precedence. This is not surprising since a display at Tate Britain counts for a great deal if you are not yet a cherished public artist. Whatever occurred, though, the outcome was bad for the Scottish artist Cathy Wilkes whose installation looks miserably puny in a gallery the size of a tennis court.</p> <p>Not that it could have filled any space with conviction, vast as it is. If pressed, you might say that this rambling assemblage of dirty dishes, cookers, check-out tills and conveyer belts, old jam jars, naked shop dummies strung with horseshoes, cups, withered balloons and nurses' hats had the aesthetic of late-flowering Surrealism. But of course it hasn't really, for it is too busy hammering its point home with all the didacticism of a fifth-form project. </p> <p>Any item could have been removed or replaced with more of the same without any loss of effect. Look at that unwashed mug labelled Daddy, those Tommy Tippee cups, those bricks in the shape of a cross, that woman with her head in a cage - and then do the maths. One of the judges has said that Wilkes's work is about disrupting 'an idealised idea of what women might be'. Nobody could disagree. For what else could it possibly be about?</p> <p>This is the kind of work that really gives curators a role as major art-explainers, the kind of work that cannot speak for itself. A wall label in Goshka Macuga's room (she got the first, incidentally, which may have saved her from looking especially lifeless by comparison with what follows) informs us that her practice 'examines the conventions of archiving, exhibition making and museum display', which makes it sounds about as appealing as a dead thing under a stone.</p> <p>Macuga is showing scuptures of tinted glass and steel (based on designs for display stands by Lilly Reich, Mies van der Rohe's lover) that look like partitions and barriers decoupled from their usual functions. She also has a dozen photomontages which splice together images from the Tate's Paul Nash and Eileen Agar archives (the artists were lovers): photographs of her body and his art. It is possible that they are intended to be elegiac, but there is a marked absence of tone. Macuga has covered the walls in a faint shower of pencilled rain. But that is the motif to bear in mind: cold, colourless and short-lived.</p> <p>Leckey's work is also knee-deep in the art of the past, but he is a cheerleader by comparison. Leckey loves Guston, Baselitz, The Simpsons and Fritz the Cat. He has a film showing how the original drawings of the cat became a cartoon and another in which Jeff Koons's polished steel bunny reflects Leckey's studio in its convex surface (though somehow not his camera) that immediately brings Van Eyck's The Arnolfini Portrait to mind. Does art reflect reality or mysteriously recreate life?</p> <p>Images stick in Leckey's mind and he often tries to animate them himself in film and sculpture. Cinema in the Round is the title of his multi-part installation and it culminates, very fittingly, with an exuberant public lecture by Leckey in a DJ. He is in fact a professor of film studies at the Stadelschule in Frankfurt (where one of the Turner Prize judges is director) and you can bet his students adore him. No disrespect to either, but BBC4 should hire him right away.</p> <p>Islam's intelligent films feel, alas, almost pedantic by comparison. Rickshaw drivers perform a still life of suspended animation until a puff of wind disturbs the tableau. A well-dressed woman examines assorted items of china on plinths, slowly nudging them, little by little, until they shatter in slo-mo. But Islam does all she can to baffle the build-up of anticipation and climax, with disruptive repetitions and cuts.</p> <p>Her unmanned camera panning indiscriminately through the backlots of a film studio, pulling in and out of focus, swinging side to side, is an interesting idea (although of course the viewpoint never settles on anything the human eye could find interesting) - until you learn that it is spelling out the letters of the word Cinematography. I expect Islam may win, because her work is so steeped in film theory and very skilfully edited. But it made me think of better film-artists who ought to have won, such as the marvellous Tacita Dean.</p> <p>It is never possible to say the Turner Prize is a dead letter. Mark Wallinger won it, to the credit of all involved, last year. But until they abolish the unwritten rule that artists mustn't appear on the shortlist more than a couple of times (unlike, say, the Man Booker) then judges are going to have to keep plucking new names from ever more distant places - and genius is not so widely spread as we might hope.</p>",
  "<p>Shaven-headed and tattooed all over with skinhead emblems and the symbols of Ulster loyalism, Sam 'Skelly' McCrory was once regarded as one of the most dangerous terrorists in Western Europe.</p> <p>He was the last commander of Ulster Defence Association inmates in the Maze prison and the closest confidant of Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, who called him his 'top operator'. McCrory was also one of two UDA leaders chosen to meet Mo Mowlam 10 years ago in her talks in the Maze aimed at salvaging the loyalist ceasefires.</p> <p>But now McCrory has become the first paramilitary to publicly out himself as a gay man. The 43-year-old has swapped a life dominated by direct involvement in UDA assassination squads in Northern Ireland for one of gay activism in Scotland.</p> <p>In his first interview, McCrory has also claimed he was the unlikely inspiration for a novel written by one of his former foes - ex-Sinn Fein publicity director Danny Morrison.</p> <p>'Even before I joined the UDA, I used to pretend I was homophobic. I went along with the crowd who were then close to the National Front. I hated Catholics, blacks, Jews and gays - even though I was gay myself. I was hiding my true self.'</p> <p>Speaking last week from exiled loyalist leader Adair's flat in Troon, west Scotland, McCrory insisted that a real-life incident involving him helped inspire Danny Morrison's novel On the Back of the Swallow.</p> <p>'The first serious love of my life was Harry Cowan, who wrote me a letter from Scotland to Crumlin Road jail where I was being held on remand in the early Nineties on hijacking charges.</p> <p>'A screw [prison officer] stole Harry's letter to me and posted it under a Provo prisoner's cell. The idea was to cause a mix among the republican and loyalist inmates, to provoke the IRA men into slagging me about my gay lover in Scotland.</p> <p>'Danny Morrison has a story in his book about being in a prison and a letter that other prisoners find. Morrison writes sympathetically about this prisoner who is ridiculed for being gay. That was based on a true incident involving me and a letter from Harry. In the real-life incident the Provo read out Harry's words to me and that kept the tension going. Morrison was in jail at the same time and must have heard about the story of the letter.'</p> <p>The incident in the Victorian jail occurred in early 1991 and months after his release McCrory was back in custody. McCrory admitted he and a UDA 'C' Company assassination squad were on their way to kill the then IRA commander of Belfast and his girlfriend, also a leading IRA figure in the city.</p> <p>Although McCrory said his life has radically changed since, he insisted he had no regrets over what he did for the loyalist cause in the past.</p> <p>'I was proud of what I did and I did it because we were under attack by violent republicanism. The war now is over. I have no problem with Sinn Fein being purely political and even being in government. It's all for the sake of peace and my war is long, long over. I don't even give Northern Ireland a thought now, not because I don't care, because there is no trouble over there.'</p> <p>McCrory revealed that at the height of his career as one of Adair's most trusted gunmen he was having a secret affair with a male RUC officer in Holywood, Co Down.</p> <p>'I used to lie to the rest of C Company that I was having a relationship with a policewoman. Only Johnny knew it was a man. The lads used to ask me \"Who's that policewoman you are shagging?\" I couldn't tell them it was a man, it was such a macho, homophobic culture.'</p> <p>He denied that he used the relationship to obtain intelligence about republican suspects. 'I never asked him for any information even though he knew who I was and what I was up to.'</p> <p>The ex-loyalist gunman said the peace process had allowed him to be himself. He now attends Gay Pride rallies across Britain from Glasgow to Brighton, regularly visits Manchester's Gay Village and marches in gay rights demonstrations across the country. Asked if he would march side by side with Irish republican gay rights activists, he said: 'I've already done that. In fact I once met a gay guy here from a republican area in Belfast. It wasn't until we were back in my hotel room he realised who I was. He panicked but I put him right and told him not to worry.</p> <p>'My past is the past and I make no apology for it. I don't try to hide it in the gay community here in Scotland or anywhere else. They knew I was a loyalist political prisoner in the Maze.'</p> <p>Why had he decided to go public both about his sexuality and his career in the notorious UDA 'C' Company?</p> <p>'There has been that much shit written about me over the last 10 years it was time to tell my side of the story. I have been beaten over the head about my sexuality in private whispers from enemies in the UDA so it was time to go public about all those things.'</p> <p>When the UDA divided in late 2002 and early 2003 over Adair's attempt to seize control of the organisation, McCrory sided with his old teenage pal whom he had known since they were members of the skinhead band Offensive Weapon in the early 1980s. He has helped Adair out in his Scottish exile but is adamant the one-time loyalist icon should not settle back in Northern Ireland. Both men remain under a UDA death sentence if they return for good to their former stronghold on Belfast's Shankill Road.</p> <p>On Troon beach, with a gale blowing in across the Irish Sea and dark clouds gathering over Ailsa Craig, the giant rock visible along the horizon of this part of the Ayrshire coast, McCrory and Adair walked together. As they ambled on the sea front they reminisced about their past lives as skinheads turned terrorists who brought Northern Ireland to the brink of civil war in 1993.</p> <p>McCrory is about to star in a Channel 5 documentary series presented by Football Factory actor Danny Dyer. Later as they walked along Troon's promenade with a slimmed down Adair complaining about the autumnal chill, McCrory reflected on the TV film of his life, turned to his old 'C' Company comrade and added: 'It was a lot of fun.'</p>",
  "<p>Did you know that people are allowed to print slogans next to the roadside, advising people to buy things? Underneath those big pictures you see sometimes, there are alluring sentences, telling us that various products will improve our life in some way. </p> <p>I also discovered last week that foreign films are not really so difficult to follow. At the bottom of the screen, all the dialogue is printed in English so that you can understand what's happening.</p> <p>Other startling new facts include: my ceiling needs repainting, my car has a dent in it and Henry VIII (as played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers in The Tudors) is all thin, with no beard!</p> <p>It has taken me a while to get glasses. I've suspected that I needed them for about 10 years. Finally, last weekend, I took a deep breath and strode in for an eye test. The fishmonger kindly explained that the optician's was next door. So I went there and bought a pair of glasses. Hello, world!</p> <p>My timing was, I thought, perfectly logical. We were on the brink of a hugely significant period in British poker. Last week began with the World Series in central London. It continued with the London leg of the European Poker Tour; that concludes today, on the eve of a new \u00a320,000 'High Roller' tournament. I am supposed to be a serious, professional player. I was the 2006 European Champion. I am meant to be highly skilled at 'reading' my opponents. But if I'm sitting more than two seats away from my opponents, I can't actually see them. </p> <p>I have kept this quiet for a long time. From the outside, I appear free from handicap, a vision of control and certainty. Inside, it's bafflement and blind panic. Like the Bradford &amp; Bingley. And, like the Bradford &amp; Bingley, it was time to admit defeat. I decided to buy glasses, at last, purely to have my best chance in this vital series of tournaments.</p> <p>Or so I thought. As I took out the new spectacles, shyly, over coffee with a friend, she said: 'Oh. You've succumbed to the Palin Effect.'</p> <p>Somewhere, I heard a gong of doom. I rushed home and googled. Everyone is getting glasses! And they're getting them because they want to look like Sarah Palin! The crazed 'pro-life' Alaskan redneck who campaigns for more oil drilling and gets up at 5am to shoot moose! </p> <p>And why has Sarah Palin made glasses sexy? It must be, surely, because she is such an idiot. Women worry that spectacles will make them look learned, blue-stocking, sexless or intimidatingly smart. In a trice, Palin whipped that stigma away. This is the woman who believes that God made dinosaurs 4,000 years ago, a theory now known as Palintology.</p> <p>What reassurance for women everywhere. You too can correct your astigmatism while still coming across as a halfwit! Men will have nothing to fear! Hillary Clinton in glasses, now that's intimidating. Sarah Palin just looks like a librarian in a porn film.</p> <p>Had this affected my decision? I have been playing big poker tournaments for years, after all. Had something Palinesque crept into my subconscious, rendering specs suddenly acceptable? I hope not, obviously. I don't think I want to come across as a charming moron. And I don't think I am affected by fashion trends; God knows my wardrobe isn't. </p> <p>I think I am 'my own person'. But I have to wonder why I never got glasses before. The answer is vanity. I'm already a bit chubby; I didn't think I could get away with being a four-eyes as well. And that means, whatever I try to tell myself, that I am affected by peer pressure, media images, 'body fascism' and an unhealthy fear of looking flawed.</p> <p>Most people are, that's why glasses have been such a modern rarity. We have to ask ourselves why they all but disappeared as soon as options became available. Contact lenses are fiddly and awkward. Laser eye correction is risky and frightening. These developments weren't actually an improvement on the simple, clever, easy choice of carrying a pair of specs. </p> <p>But we've been spending the money and suffering the trauma, in our desperation to avoid that most fatal of images: the doomed, swottish combination of mental strength and physical weakness. Short-sighted indeed.</p> <p>I couldn't have contacts or laser anyway; I am horribly squeamish about all things eye-related. If I see someone touching their eyes, I feel sick. This is especially embarrassing since my mother is an anaesthetist who specialises in ophthalmology. When I was a child, whenever she wasn't at home, I knew that she was off assisting in a vital and delicate piece of eye surgery. Happy Christmas, amateur psychologists!</p> <p>But I think we can expect to see glasses rise again: in fashion magazines, on catwalks, on Kate Moss. Mid-crunch, there is a mood of sobriety in the air, of slower living, gentler ambitions and more straightforward dealings. I bet we are due an 'honest' fashion trend: glasses instead of contacts, cold cream instead of Botox, patched skirts instead of new. We will wear our flaws on our faces, like Gawain wore the green sash: 'Mea culpa. We have been too vain. We have aimed too high. See how I am newly sincere, earthy and realistic. [Lunettes, \u00a3185, Paul Smith].' </p> <p>There: those are the brash topical and zeitgeist points that every traditional newspaper column must contain. And now, in keeping with the new, small, sober, serious mood, here is my small, sober, serious point: if you've always been scared to wear glasses too, get over it. Buy a pair. You don't realise how blind you were until you do that, and suddenly you see trees, birds, faces, subtleties, cards; it's absolutely mind-blowing. The world is a beautiful place. Get some glasses. It's simple, safe, important and changes your life.</p> <p>Not that I'll actually be wearing mine. Are you kidding? They make me look like Miss Havisham.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victoriacoren.com\">victoriacoren.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Creditors</strong> <br>Donmar Warehouse, London WC2</p> <p><strong>The Girlfriend Experience</strong> <br>Jerwood Theatre Upstairs, Royal Court, London SW1 <strong>Girl with a Pearl Earring</strong><br>Theatre Royal Haymarket, London SW1</p> <p>Alan Rickman's forensic production of <strong>Creditors</strong> makes it look like Strindberg's best play. The playwright's hallmark ingredients are there: anti-women rants, emotionally eviscerated men, poisonous sexual liaisons. Yet the sympathies are more acute than in Miss Julie, the arguments more spry; the development is more circuitous and unexpected than in The Dance of Death. Strindberg called for a new kind of theatre, whose intensity would be ratcheted up by a small auditorium and a small stage: the Donmar is that auditorium; in it, a play first seen in 1888 startles with its modernity.</p> <p>Strindberg and Rickman have chucked out the chintz. Every aspect is spare and concentrated: one room, three people, few events, and discussions which constantly move into closer focus, greater intricacy, helped by David Greig's subtle new version. The play drills down from flesh to bone. A man sets out to destroy his former wife's marriage; the play closes on three ruined lives. Destructive speech has a physical effect: the word becomes flesh, in truly theatrical fashion.</p> <p>Here are three actors at the top of their talent. As the prowling first husband, Owen Teale cleverly concocts an opaque persona, both bluff and wily. Anna Chancellor, transfixed both by love and lust, begins as a bird of prey and ends by showing herself buffeted, out of control. Tom Burke, open and trembling, makes her new young love look like a morsel waiting to be picked off. </p> <p>The action looks all the blacker for taking place on a stage that is drenched in light. Ben Stones's beautiful maritime design - presumably influenced by the interiors of Wilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i - is stripped down and bleached. Adam Cork's soundscape wraps every scene in a bell jar: outside you hear the clangs of bells and drips of water.</p> <p>Everyone should sample <strong>The Girlfriend Experience</strong>. This first-rate production by Joe Hill-Gibbins of Alecky Blythe's crackling verbatim drama offers different revelations: about the lives it puts on stage, and about the way you listen to dialogue. Blythe's method - brilliantly shown in Come Out Eli five years ago - is to record first-hand accounts and play the edited interviews, here with Bournemouth prostitutes, to the actors on stage through headphones: as they copy the hesitations, repetitions and gulps of ordinary speech, they expose the staid notions of normal talk. </p> <p>Usually when people talk to themselves in a theatre, they're having a soliloquy: not here; they are muttering to keep going. Behind the towels draped to dry at the back of the sitting room a dog barks. The telephone goes: 'Your mum's busy at the moment,' one woman explains; from the next room comes the sound of a hairbrush meeting a bum. There's a knock on the door which announces Viagra Man: he gets his balls tied up with stockings. Or it's God's Gift, who isn't, and Dickhead, who in the end is turned away because Tessa just can't face doing the thing he likes best any more. There's the man who wants to watch one of the girls squashing his girlfriend. In baby-doll black lace, specs on the end of her nose, Tessa - 'very busty, 38, curvy' - knocks together a bookshelf while waiting for the next client. These women aren't patronised or made into gargoyles: their sentences are gorgeous. They simply reveal their lives. What more could you want from the theatre?</p> <p>Pretty but pointless, <strong>Girl with a Pearl Earring</strong> dutifully works its way through Tracy Chevalier's novel. Griet, a bright and beautiful girl, becomes a servant in Vermeer's house, and causes mayhem when the genius admires and paints her: 'Ever heard of allegory, Griet?' </p> <p>This mayhem is about as turbulent as a millpond. Joe Dowling's production frames the masterpieces efficiently but leaves the actors little to do but provide varieties of akimbo acting: artist akimbo (with palette); maid akimbo (wench with a bonnet and hand on hip). 'Creativity held me captive,' exclaims Vermeer. Not at the Haymarket it doesn't.</p>",
  "<p>In one photograph a young boy, his arms spread as if in supplication, gazes listlessly at the ceiling as a woman - his mother, we presume - cradles him tenderly in her arms. In another, a grey-haired man attached to an oxygen cylinder sits cross-legged on a hospital bed staring vacantly into the middle distance. In two further pictures we encounter similar expressions, this time in the eyes of a man bundled up in bed taking his meds and a baby framed against the film of a chest X-ray occluded by ghostly white shadows.</p> <p>The child in the first picture is Chan Thai, a 12-year-old from Svay Reing in Cambodia. He is pictured in the throes of tuberculosis meningitis, a disease that should no longer afflict children in this century. The names of the others have not been recorded, but whether from India or Lesotho, Swaziland or Siberia, they too are victims of TB, a disease now re-emerging in a deadly new form with devastating consequences in villages, shanty towns and cities across the globe.</p> <p>'Tuberculosis is a shocking disease,' explains James Nachtwey, the American war photographer behind these extraordinary images. 'I'm a very experienced journalist. I've seen a lot of terrible things in this world, but witnessing TB is something that affected me as profoundly as anything I saw in Iraq or Afghanistan. My heart went out to the victims and when people see these photographs I hope their hearts will go out to them, too.'</p> <p>Starting this weekend, Nachtwey will get his wish when TED, a New York-based organisation that brings together leading scientists, thinkers and designers committed to social change, begins exhibiting his photographs in galleries around the world. The brainchild of Chris Anderson, a former magazine entrepreneur, TED grants $100,000 to three outstanding people each year and gives them 'one wish to change the world'. Nachtwey's was to use his skills as a photojournalist to raise global awareness of 'extensively drug resistant tuberculosis' (XDR-TB for short) and in the process demonstrate the power of news photography in the digital age.</p> <p>With TED's funding, Nachtwey travelled to countries as diverse as Cambodia, Siberia, Rwanda and India, documenting the depredations of XDR-TB and the efforts of governments and NGOs to pioneer new treatment programmes that may arrest the disease's progression. On Friday, TED unveiled a slide show of more than 50 of Nachtwey's images at the Lincoln Center in New York and the National Theatre in London. Over the next few weeks the same photographs will be shown on outdoor screens in 50 cities worldwide and on the internet as part of a multimedia campaign that aims to harness the power of the web and 'viral marketing' techniques. At the same time the UK think-tank Demos will exhibit Nachtwey's photographs in a gallery in Brick Lane, east London, renamed the Emergency Room.</p> <p>Nachtwey's aim is to bring TB more into the 'mass consciousness,' in the hope of kick-starting an action campaign that can leverage more funds for aid. 'The problem at the moment is that very few people in the West are even conscious of TB,' he says. 'The more people are aware of it, the easier it is to raise funds and get sponsorship for research.'</p> <p>Tuberculosis is one of the oldest diseases known to man and certainly one of the deadliest. Evidence of tuberculosis has been found in the skeletons of Egyptian mummies and in an Iron Age settlement in Dorset. Scientists estimate that in the past 400 years TB has killed some 2bn people worldwide, and disfigured, crippled and blinded countless more. It is not for nothing that the 17th-century English writer and preacher John Bunyan called TB 'the captain of all these men of death'.</p> <p>Spread like the common cold or flu by coughing and sneezing, the tubercle bacillus most commonly infects the lungs, slowly eating away at the spongy tissue essential for respiration and forming abscesses that discharge foul-smelling pus. However, the microbe spares no part of the human body and can also spill into the digestive tract, causing ulcerations of the throat and bloody diarrhoea, or into the bloodstream where it causes a condition known as milliary tuberculosis that can prove fatal to the kidneys, heart and other organs. If it crosses the blood-brain barrier, TB can also cause meningitis, coma and death.</p> <p>More usually, however, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a seductively slow assassin. Hippocrates labelled the disease phthisis - from the Greek term for 'wasting' - because of the way that patients under its influence seemed to gradually wither away, and even after Robert Koch's groundbreaking isolation of the bacillus in 1882 doctors continued to refer to TB as 'consumption' well into the Twenties. At the height of the disease's prevalence in the 18th and 19th centuries it claimed the lives of as many as 100,000 Britons every year. Prominent victims included John Keats, Emily Bront\u00eb and Robert Louis Stevenson - associations that gave it an aura of romance and poetry. However, for anyone who has witnessed the disease at close hand, there is nothing romantic about TB, and today it is back with a vengeance.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that every year TB kills 1.6m people - or one person every 18 seconds (by contrast, malaria is responsible for some 1m deaths worldwide, or roughly one person every 30 seconds). Although that is still short of the annual death toll from HIV/Aids (between 1.8m and 2.3m), separating the two diseases increasingly makes little sense. 'If there's a high population with HIV, then people are much more susceptible to the disease,' explains Nachtwey.</p> <p>Born in Syracuse, New York, Nachtwey made his name as a witness to some of the world's bloodiest and most intractable conflicts. A five- times winner of the Robert Capa Gold Medal, he covered the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the early Eighties, the Serb invasion of Kosovo in 1999 and countless other war and famine zones from Bosnia to the Sudan. In 2003 Nachtwey was on assignment with a US Army platoon in Iraq when an insurgent tossed a grenade into his Humvee. The grenade severed the hand of one of his journalistic colleagues, but Nachtwey still had the wherewithal to photograph the medics who came to their rescue before he passed out.</p> <p>He first became interested in TB in 2000 when Time magazine sent him to South Africa to cover Aids. The government was still in denial over the scale of the epidemic, but visiting villages and wards where people with HIV were sent for 'treatment for TB', it soon became obvious that the two diseases were linked and the problem was growing.</p> <p>Then, in 2003, the Cambodian Health Committee (CHC), an independent NGO that is the brainchild of Harvard infectious disease expert Dr Anne Goldfeld and a former Cambodian refugee worker Dr Sok Thim, invited Nachtwey to document their in-country treatment programme. Nachtwey travelled with Thim to Svay Reing, delivering drugs to remote rural areas and going on house visits. It was during one of these visits that he photographed a 12-year-old peasant boy who had just lost his mother to TB. Nachtwey arrived just as the boy, dressed in Buddhist robes, was preparing to lead the funeral procession through the paddy fields to the funeral pyre. His photograph of Va Ling, clutching a framed picture of his mother to his chest, is both moving and timeless. Exhibited in 2007 at the United Nations in New York on the occasion of World TB Day, it was this photograph - and the reaction to it - that convinced Nachtwey that a slide show of similarly arresting images could be a means of raising consciousness of TB worldwide.'There are lots of very impressive statistics about TB, but I wanted to put a human face on it.'</p> <p>With TED's help, Nachtwey visited seven countries blighted by XDR-TB, returning to Cambodia and South Africa but also documenting new TB hotspots such as Rwanda, Lesotho, Swaziland and Siberia. </p> <p>An airborne rod-like microbe, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is most commonly transmitted in air droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. The good news is that unlike a cold or flu, TB is not highly contagious - it usually takes several hours of continuous exposure for a sick person to transmit the disease to someone who is healthy. The bad news, however, is that the bacillus can hang around in the atmosphere for weeks or months - much longer than other bacteria - and although 60 per cent of those infected will successfully fight off and destroy an infection, one in three people continues to carry the bacillus in dormant form. The danger is that if their immune system is suddenly compromised or they are infected with HIV, these latent infections may revive.</p> <p>Even so, if TB is diagnosed early, it is eminently treatable, usually with a six- to eight-month course of oral antibiotics. However, if patients fail to complete the prescribed course of treatment, the bacteria may become resistant, meaning doctors have to prescribe other harder-to-tolerate second-line medications, for periods of between one and two years. This in turn makes compliance even harder, resulting in a vicious cycle of rising rates of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and new infections.</p> <p>Resistance to streptomycin, the original TB drug, was first reported in 1948. Since then the bacillus has also bred resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid - the front-line combination therapies recommended by the WHO - as well as to many second-line oral antibiotics and third-line injectable drugs. </p> <p>The result is that last year there were 500,000 new cases of MDR-TB, of which 2 per cent were deemed by the WHO to be XDR-TB and 'virtually untreatable'. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and Tomsk Oblast in Siberia, which houses a 7,000-strong prison population, were particularly hard hit with some of the highest rates of MDR-TB ever recorded.</p> <p>In South Africa TB is closely linked to rising rates of HIV, whereas in Russia the resurgence of the disease can be traced to the economic dislocation that followed the demise of the Soviet Union. As health and social services collapsed and alcoholism skyrocketed, many people developed TB because their immune systems, weakened by drugs, alcohol and poor nutrition, could no longer keep latent TB in check. During the long, cold Siberian winters, the hallways and unventilated cells of the Tomsk jails also provided ideal conditions for the transmission of the virus, resulting in the prisons becoming an 'epidemiological pump' spreading the disease throughout the general population.</p> <p>As part of his journey Nachtwey visited one of the Tomsk prison colonies. His guide was Partners-in-Health (PIH), a Boston-based NGO founded by Dr Paul Farmer that helps manage treatment programmes inside Siberian prisons, as well as in community settings.</p> <p>When PIH first arrived in the region, the WHO had effectively written off MDR-TB as untreatable. Instead, it was insisting that Russia adopt its directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) treatment programme, despite the fact that in many parts of the country chemists had run out of the oral antibiotics.</p> <p>Armed with a $10m grant from the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, PIH adopted a different strategy. Beginning in 2000 it encouraged local doctors, first in the prison system and then throughout the region, to treat all cases of MDR-TB aggressively. At around the same time, the WHO agreed to green-light the supply of second-line drugs at sharply reduced prices. The result was that the cost of treating a patient was halved, from around \u00a36,000 to \u00a33,000, and compliance rates shot up. Today, PIH claims its 'DOTS-plus' programme in Siberia is achieving a near 80 per cent cure rate. However, while the deaths from TB are down, drug resistance is still rising - about 15 per cent of new cases according to the latest figures.</p> <p>Despite this setback, Nachtwey insists PIH's programme is a rare success story. 'They've shown that in most cases TB can be cured - you can actually be healed.'</p> <p>Nachtwey was similarly impressed by PIH's facility at a hospital in Maseru, Lesotho, which it runs in partnership with the government and which boasts similar cure rates. And in India, which has the highest number of TB cases of any country in the world, he spent 10 days visiting hospitals and clinics in Mumbai and Chennai, where he found government programmes are also well organised.</p> <p>However, the country he knows best and where he has seen the most marked progress is Cambodia. When Sok Thim and Anne Goldfeld founded the CHC in 1994 the country had some of the highest TB rates in the world. As in Russia, the MDR-TB cases were considered untreatable. Goldfeld and Thim changed all that by offering patients free medication if they signed a contract pledging they would finish their treatment and by getting friends and family to serve as co-guarantors. At the same time CHC negotiated nutritional supplements from the World Food Program, thus reducing the likelihood that patients and their families would go hungry - a key factor in speeding recovery. </p> <p>The result is that CHC has treated 13,000 Cambodians for TB and boasts cure rates as high as 95 per cent. At the same time, Goldfeld, who also runs a biomedical research lab at Harvard, has been able to identify a key susceptibility gene for TB and a unique immune reaction that helps the microbe evade human immune defences - research that may eventually lead to new treatments and vaccines.</p> <p>Now, with the help of the WHO, Goldfeld is negotiating wider access to subsidised drugs and running a trial looking at the best timing for medications for patients with dual TB/HIV infections.</p> <p>'Our programmes show that everyone can be well if you give them the right education and support,' says Goldfeld. 'It doesn't matter if you live in the city or the poorest part of Cambodia. If you get the drugs to people and provide communities with food and other forms of support, TB can be beaten.'</p> <p>However, for all the progress that has been made in Svay Reing, CHC operates on a shoestring and can't be there to treat every patient or prevent every new infection. This is the true tragedy of TB. Sometime between the Twenties (when French researchers first developed the BCG vaccine) and the Fifties (when the vaccine was first given to schoolchildren in Britain and other European countries), the West took its eye off the ball. Thinking that TB had been consigned to the dustbin of medical history, we failed to invest in new drugs or better vaccines that would extend the protection conferred by the BCG to adults in later life. As Paul Farmer, the founder of PIH and a medical anthropologist with years of experience treating TB and other infectious diseases puts it: 'In failing to curb tuberculosis a window of opportunity has been slammed shut. We must acknowledge that our guilt surpasses that of earlier generations who lacked our resources.'</p> <p>Chan Thai is a case in point. Tuberculosis meningitis is extremely rare in the UK thanks to immunisation with the BCG and good child healthcare services. Not so in Cambodia. Nachtwey and Goldfeld first encountered Chan Thai at the local hospital in Svay Reing where his mother had brought him for emergency treatment. One of four children from a farming family, Chan Thai had collapsed suddenly at home with a fever and convulsions. At hospital he was given a spinal tap and a cocktail of antibiotics. Even so, doctors couldn't prevent him suffering further seizures and slipping into a coma. Fortunately, he recovered and was eventually able to return home. </p> <p>Nevertheless, when Nachtwey took his photograph, says Goldfeld, Chan Thai was still clearly mentally discombobulated - hence the vacant, far-away look in his eyes. 'This is not MDR-TB, this is what even normal TB can do,' says Goldfeld. 'Although the picture was taken in Cambodia, it could have been taken in Kosovo or Cuzco - anywhere that TB is rampant.'</p> <p>Details of Nachtwey's slide show are on <a href=\"http://www.xdrtb.org.\">www.xdrtb.org.</a> For further information about TB worldwide or to donate to TB Alert, go to <a href=\"http://www.tbalert.org\">www.tbalert.org</a> or <a href=\"http://www.stoptb.org\">www.stoptb.org</a>.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> About 11 years ago my son-in-law bought us a bottle of 1993 Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, Pauillac. For medical reasons we no longer drink wine, but have kept the bottle in its original wrapping, lying horizontally. Should we sell it, and if so, how would we go about it? Roger Finney </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Roger, That was a very generous gift. It's a good Mouton from an average vintage, which currently sells for around \u00a31,600 per case under bond (that is excluding duty, VAT and costs). Your best bet is to sell it to your local fine wine merchant or broker, such as Farr Vintners, Seckford or Wilkinson Vintners, who would offer you around \u00a3100, providing you deliver the wine yourself. Shame you can't drink it. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Tim, I haven't a clue about food and wine matching, but do you think Moscato d'Asti, which has long been a favourite of mine, might go well with Thai food? Apparently, Nahm restaurant in London, had a tasting recently and the winner for Thai food was an Australian Riesling. However, they didn't try Moscato. Jonathan Cahill</p> <p><strong>A</strong> I'm a great fan of Moscato, too. As you know, the wine is pretty sweet, so it would be tricky to partner with the delicate flavours of Thai food. A dry Aussie Riesling sounds a better bet to me. Give your Moscato a go, but I think it would work better with a bowl of strawberries or a lemon tart.</p> <p>\u2022 If you have a wine question for Tim, email <a href=\"mailto:ask.tim@observer.co.uk\">ask.tim@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>What she watched:</strong></p> <p><strong>Heroes</strong> BBC2</p> <p><strong>Silent Witness</strong> BBC1</p> <p><strong>Little Britain USA</strong> BBC2</p> <p><strong>The Pride of Britain Awards</strong> ITV1</p> <p>Boy, do we need some superheroes. Real live ones would be great, obviously (stand back Barack - Bankerman will Save Wall Street, Save the World ... ) but we'll take what we can get for as long as there's enough electricity to fire up the television, given that by January we'll be reduced to making adaptations of Gone with the Wind with candles and shadow puppets, before heading up the stairs to Bedfordshire with a hottie. </p> <p>Well, the lucky ones - Premiership footballers, Russian oligarchs - will get hotties, while the rest of us will make do with hot water. Forget the credit crunch, it's time to batten down the hatches and bring on the Busby Berkeley Babes. And Jodie Kidd and Rachel Stevens in sequins on Strictly Come Dancing</p> <p>So where are we, <strong>Heroes</strong>-wise? Well, at the top of the first episode of series three, we were four years into the future, with Claire pointing a gun at Peter. However, by the miracle of CGI, not to mention the warp and weft of the space-time continuum, he dodged the bullet and we were back to the present, with Nathan apparently assassinated by Peter while giving a press conference ... before, by the miracle that is screenwriting, somehow regenerating. </p> <p>Meanwhile Hiro was chairman, chairman of the bored, and discovering that his late father not only left him a multi-gazillion-yen company to run but a DVD from beyond the grave in which he told his son never to open the office safe. Necessarily attuned to the nuances of high-quality drama, Hiro immediately opened the safe and found another DVD, in which his father said 'I told you not to open the safe ... ' </p> <p>And then - hooray! - came my all-time favourite TV drama line, the one no self-respecting show should ever avoid deploying, given the opportunity: </p> <p>'What do you want from me?' Claire asked Sylar. </p> <p>'I want what you have. I want your power.' Which swiftly translated into some dirty, Dexter-ish, deliciously shot and rather disturbingly erotic brain surgery. </p> <p>After season one, two was a disappointment, but already three has the looks, the moves and the attitude, plus the shamelessly indulgent and yet oddly sincere quasi-spiritual rhetoric that only Hollywoodland can deliver without making us snigger: 'We're all connected. Our hopes and dreams, our children's futures, reflecting back in each others' eyes, we fight our own personal battles but we know we're not alone because only together can we make our short time on this planet mean something. Only together can we be stewards of our own destiny ... and we hold in our collective hearts one noble goal, to save ourselves, to save the world.' </p> <p>Given this sounded like the party conference speech of our collective dreams, could Heroes be any more attuned to the times? Will the national grid cope with the HD plasma surges at 9pm on Wednesdays? And is it possible for Hayden Panettiere to look any hotter handling a gun? No, no and thrice no. </p> <p>'What do you want from me?' shouted Leo at AJ in the second part of last week's <strong>Silent Witness</strong></p> <p>Brilliant. This already plausible story of south London gangs and gun and knife crime (superbly directed by Sue 'Susan' Tully, formerly 'Enders's 'Chelle, though I refuse to accept she's old enough) was already timely and convincing but suddenly made itself unmissable. I don't recall AJ's response, but in a TV drama the answer to this question rarely, if ever, matters - it's just important that it's asked. </p> <p>There were some stunningly good performances from the young cast, notably the charismatic Aml Ameen as AJ (nominally playing a football coach but, what with being a Potential Saviour of Disenfranchised Urban Youth, also burdened with being the moral and ethical heart of the story, which he wore very lightly), Charles Mnene as the twisted gang leader Keenan Barnes and little Kedar Williams-Stirling as Levi Harris, the doomed pawn in the bitter gang rivalries. </p> <p>In fact these three acted the male Witness regulars, to whom I am devoted (Tom Ward or William Gaminara? Hm, tough call. Has to be both), off the screen - while Emilia Fox's Nikki was reduced to some snogging with, and falling for, the handsome paramedic who was so obviously far too good to be true that for ages I entertained the possibility he may suddenly scream: 'What do you want from me?' while ripping off a latex face, thus revealing himself to be south London's gangsta kingpin. But no, poor Emilia discovered it was all over when he revealed himself to be a racist instead - a risk that even the smartest forensic tech will have to run if she accepts a date while distracted by a warm corpse. </p> <p>As Messrs Lucas and Walliams didn't bother asking me, I decided to ask myself what I wanted from <strong>Little Britain USA</strong>, and the answer was, inevitably, 'I want that one ... ' </p> <p>For Matt and David's big transatlantic HBO adventure (with some celebrity direction from David Schwimmer) Lou and Andy are on holiday in Mississippi, Bubbles is on a cruise and Marjorie busy co-opting US celebrities into Fatfighters (to guest star Rosie O'Donnell: 'She's big. She's a big lady. She's a big lesbian lady ... '), while they have been joined by Ellie-Grace, a potty-mouthed Brownie, and my favourite new character, Byng Gordon, 'the only man with a moustache who's been to the moon'. Byng is still bitter that, as the eighth man to kick moondust in slo-mo, live coverage of his walk was cut in favour of a football game. He is also necessarily dismissive of any astronaut whose name people may actually remember. </p> <p>'So, what's Michael Collins doing now?' </p> <p>'Who cares? He didn't even get out of the freaking spacecraft thing.' </p> <p>I had thought Little Britain was probably well past its sell-by, but this made me (deep breath) laugh out loud, which is more than it managed to do when everybody else was laughing at it. Weird that, but pleasantly so. </p> <p>I don't know if early onset sentimentalia is actually a recognised medical condition but <strong>The Pride of Britain Awards</strong> - effectively a tough competition to see whether viewers can make it from one commercial break to another without breaking down - had me (plus some Spice Girls, Sir Michael Caine, the PM and Mrs B, Vernon and Tess, Kelly Brook, McFly, Shirley Bassey, Rachel Stevens, Ant 'n' Dec, Kevin Spacey, Dannii Minogue ... ) in pieces, crying 'What do you want from me, ITV?' </p> <p>Lance Corporal Matt Croucher saves his comrades by hurling himself on to a grenade in Afghanistan - and lives; Carol Saldinack shops her sons to the cops for their violent attack on a defenceless man - who now calls her 'my mum'; 11-year-old Liam Fairhurst raises \u00a3160k for charity in honour of his dead friend - while suffering from cancer himself; Damilola Taylor's recently widowed father, Richard, stands there and says absolutely nothing - in a dignified, humbling way ... I was a mess, I tell you, surrounded by soggy Kleenex. </p> <p>It was inspiring stuff, so (if I can get this bloody latex mask off) I'm ready to start searching for the hero inside myself almost immediately. Yup, I'm right on it. Promise.

  "<p>Fears are mounting that many Wall Street banks and financial firms will refuse to participate in the US government's $700bn bail-out package, leaving global markets and world economies in a perilous state for months to come.</p> <p>'There is a growing feeling that banks ... might instead decide to tough it out,' said Thomas Caldwell, chairman and CEO of Caldwell Financial, a $1bn-plus fund manager.</p> <p>For the past two weeks all eyes in the market have been focused on US Congress and its attempts to pass Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's bail-out package - a bill to allow the US government to buy up to $700bn of toxic mortgage-related assets from American banks, which would in theory free the credit markets and set the gears of global commerce spinning once more.</p> <p>Last Monday, after the bill was thrown out by the House of Representatives, more than $1 trillion was wiped off the value of US stocks as the market was gripped by panic.

  "<p>It was a scene that many Americans had been waiting exactly 13 years to see. OJ Simpson, the former American football star widely believed to have got away with murder, was found guilty in a court of law, meaning he could spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p> <p>On the exact anniversary of the day in 1995 in which Simpson was cleared of killing his ex-wife and another man, he was found guilty of robbery and kidnapping in a bizarre Las Vegas crime.</p> <p>Standing in the courtroom in 'Sin City', Simpson winced briefly but visibly as Judge Jackie Glass denied him bail and ordered him sent to the cells to await his sentencing date. Dressed in a sharp, dark blue suit, he seemed to nod but remained calm. The same could not said of his sister, Carmelita Durio. She broke down in tears and collapsed to the floor of the court. Paramedics treated her as Simpson was led away.</p> <p>It was a remarkable end to a strange trial that saw Simpson accused of robbing two sports memorabilia salesmen at gunpoint. They were hawking items from Simpson's own life and he claimed he was just getting his stuff back. That was not enough for the jury, who took 13 hours to reach their verdict, which was delivered in dramatic late-night scenes. 'The verdict was not a shock. We knew it going in. There was a lot of baggage,' said defence lawyer Yale Galanter, who is now planning an appeal.</p> <p>The word 'baggage' hardly covers it. The shadow of the 1995 verdict, which cleared Simpson of slashing to death Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman, loomed over the trial. Indeed it has cast a dark pall over America for more than a decade. News programmes called it the Trial of the Century and it gave birth to a modern culture of celebrity crime, helped spawn the 24-hour news cycle and, some say, turned justice into show business. It also deeply divided America on racial grounds. A mostly black jury cleared Simpson amid accusations of police racism. Yet at the time many Americans, especially whites, believed Simpson was clearly guilty. </p> <p>In time, many black Americans came to join them, especially after Simpson wrote a book last year called If I Did It, in which he detailed a gruesome 'theoretical' version of the events of the night of the murder. In the book, Simpson describes going to Brown's house, carrying a knife, arguing with her and then being shocked when Goldman appears. He then blacks out and comes to again only to find the two bloodied bodies. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, that left many Americans with a sense of justice denied. But perhaps not now. For those who believe Simpson has spent years walking free despite being guilty of a double killing, the sight of Simpson trudging off to a Nevada jail will have been a long-awaited prize. Justice may have been delayed, but it was not denied.</p> <p>The events that led to Simpson's final downfall began in the distinctly ordinary surroundings of Room 1203 of the Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on 13 September 2007. Two men, Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley, had set up shop in the room, spreading out their memorabilia from Simpson's distinguished sports career.</p> <p>The men had been told by a friend, Thomas Riccio, that he would bring a buyer to meet them. But instead Riccio brought Simpson and a gang of other men. At least one them was armed with a gun. They burst into the room, angrily shouting a stream of obscenities. The two salesmen were pushed against a wall and Simpson and his gang gathered up their goods in pillowcases and then marched out of the casino. The two shaken men called the police and gave them the extraordinary news that they had just been robbed by OJ Simpson.</p> <p>Simpson was arrested a few days later. It seemed an open and shut case. Even in Las Vegas you cannot rob people at gunpoint and then expect to simply walk away. Yet things, as they always seem to have done around Simpson, took a strange twist. A recording of the robbery turned up on celebrity websites. It sounded like a scene from the violent gangster movie Reservoir Dogs as Simpson screamed abuse. It turned out that Riccio, who had encouraged Fromong and Beardsley into Room 1203, had also bugged the room. It was also Riccio who then told Simpson about the men. He then sold the resulting audio tapes, on which Simpson can be clearly heard, for thousands of dollars to a celebrity website. </p> <p>That fact had many people - not just Simpson's dwindling band of supporters - suspecting that there might have been some sort of set-up. But not the police. Nevada authorities, once they had Simpson in their sights, did not let go. Riccio was not charged with any crime. Then, one by one, the men whom Simpson had led to Room 1203, began to turn against him. All four of Simpson's former co-defendants were 'flipped' by police. </p> <p>All testified against him and two of them linked him to making threats and, crucially, the use of a gun in the crime. Simpson had denied knowing anyone had brought a weapon to the room. But prosecutors said that was nonsense and Simpson's co-defendants became the prosecution's star witnesses. 'For Mr. Simpson to claim to people that he did not see any gun is flat-out nonsense. These defendants talked about guns. Mr Simpson asked them to bring guns, and they saw guns in the room,' said prosecutor David Roger.</p> <p>In the end, the jury agreed. They took a long time to reach their verdict but they did eventually reach it. The crime might have been shady and bizarre, but it was still a crime. The 61-year-old Simpson, who has spent his recent years golfing and partying in Florida, could now get a life sentence. That would see him die behind bars. One of Simpson's friends, Tom Scotto, held a press conference after the verdict. Clearly angry, he told a throng of reporters that Simpson was the victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice. He had been set up. 'What kind of justice is this? This is not justice!' Scotto claimed.</p> <p>It is doubtful that many Americans will have much sympathy. That was similar to the cry of injustice that went out from many people in 1995 when Simpson walked free from accusations that he had brutally slaughtered Brown and Goldman. The crime itself was shocking. The two victims were found outside Brown's home and Simpson was arrested after a long and infamous car chase across Los Angeles. </p> <p>In his white Ford Bronco Simpson had led a cavalcade of police and reporters along the city's motorways. Covered live on television the route had become lined with gawkers and supporters. It had been the perfect nexus of a live news event, the public and the media. Many commentators believe that car chase and the case that followed it gave dubious birth to a new celebrity-drenched age of media. </p> <p>Certainly it is not hard to see why it held such a fascination for America. Though largely unknown to the outside world, Simpson was a legend in America. He had overcome an impoverished and sickly childhood to become one of America's sporting heroes. His prowess on the field was legendary. Then he began a successful career in Hollywood, often playing a loveable good guy. </p> <p>His marriage to Brown - across America's still deep racial divide - seemed a fairytale. Here was the great black athletic hero with the stunning blonde bombshell wife. If it had not been real life, it would have been the perfect Tinseltown movie script. Except that this story had a vicious twist. </p> <p>Their marriage was far from perfect. When things soured, Simpson emerged as a violent man with a dangerous temper. He was jealous of any hint that Brown might have a new boyfriend. Even if he had not led the cops on a merry chase in his Bronco, Simpson was already a suspect. Covered exhaustively in the media, the trial rapidly degenerated into a racially tinged showcase. Simpson's legal 'dream team', led by the flamboyant Johnnie Cochran, unashamedly played the race card. Their case was greatly helped when one of the cops in the case, Mark Fuhrman, was recorded talking repeatedly about 'niggers'. In the end, to the shock of many white Americans, and the delight of many black Americans, Simpson was found not guilty. </p> <p>But he did not escape entirely. The past 13 years of Simpson's life have been a twilight existence. He emerged back into the world apparently believing he could restart his career as a celebrity. He could not. He was ruthlessly pursued by Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, in the courts. He brought a civil suit against Simpson for the deaths. </p> <p>In civil cases the burden of proof is less stringent and Simpson was held liable for the deaths and hit for $33m. That bankrupted him for life. Instead of a mega-star existence, he fled to Florida where he led a distinctly easy, but middle-class suburban existence, sustained by his pensions. Every attempt to come back into the public eye seemed horribly misguided. He tried to create a reality TV show that mocked elements of the murder trial. He wrote his bizarre pseudo-confessional book, then saw a wave of outrage cancel it. </p> <p>He seemed to live in a different world, where people still asked him for autographs and swarmed around him at night clubs. But it was because of the murders, not because of his football career or acting. Perhaps oblivious to the fact, perhaps not, Simpson became one of the most reviled men in America. </p> <p>For Goldman, the trial in Las Vegas provided some tiny relief for the loss of his son. 'He's not going to get the punishment for Ron's murder that he deserved, but at least he should be in jail for as long as they can put him there,' he said last week.</p> <p>So now the Simpson story could finally be over. Though he plans an appeal, it seems almost certain that Simpson will finally be heading for a lengthy stint in jail. Maybe it will be for the rest of his life. But he leaves an America that he changed completely. The original Simpson trial created a public obsession with criminal justice, especially as it related to celebrities. It led to a public clamour around all the other celebrity trials - such as those of Michael Jackson and Phil Spector and the post-mortem of Anna Nicole Smith - and seemed to create a generation of lawyers and judges who understood that a high-profile case could lead to a new career in entertainment. It also broke down the barriers between news and the public. They watched the car chase live on TV and followed the court case as it was broadcast direct from the courtroom. Then they could go and meet the suspect himself if they hung out in the sports bars of suburban Miami. </p> <p>But not any longer. Simpson is now in jail and for many Americans the strange incident in Room 1203 was irrelevant. They will see Simpson, at long last, serving time for murder.</p> <h2>From hero to criminal</h2> <p><strong>July 1947</strong> <br>Orenthal James Simpson is born in San Francisco.

  "<p>Last week's big food story was one of haves and have nots. The haves include Tesco, which announced half-year profits of \u00a31.5bn on the back of rising global food prices and booming sales of organics. The shelves are full and business is brisk. The have nots were the benighted populations of Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa, which, the UN warns, is heading into the worst famine in generations. The one thing these two stories share is a negative: British supermarkets and large slabs of Africa are both entirely free of genetically modified foods.</p> <p>According to the government's former chief scientist, Sir David King, these narratives are completely intertwined.</p> <p>In a recent speech to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, King accused the British middle classes of putting lives at risk in the developing world through their food choices. 'The problem is,' he said, 'the Western world's move toward organic farming - a lifestyle choice - and against agricultural technology and GM in particular, has been adopted across Africa ... with devastating consequences.'</p> <p>It was proof of just how divisive the debate over the genetic modification of our crops has become. On the one side are the biotech companies and their supporters in the scientific community who believe GM has the potential to reduce the cost of food, increase yields and bring into cultivation land that might otherwise have remained barren, thus helping to feed the growing number of the world's hungry. On the other side are the environmentalists, who predict that a vicious toll will be paid in what these new, under-regulated foods will do to our bodies and to the planet.</p> <p>On Friday the opponents of GM felt they had something to celebrate as news of the government reshuffle broke. Two weeks before, at a Labour conference fringe meeting, food and farming minister Jeff Rooker was laying into the anti-GM crowd for wallowing in 'ignorance', and being on a 'messianic mission' to kill the technology. 'It is like a religion, but there is no science base to it.' Now suddenly Rooker was out, not just from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - itself to be divided up - but from the entire government.</p> <p>If his critics took Rooker's departure as an excuse to pop the corks on a few bottles of organic, bio-dynamic champagne, they would have been premature. Because the news that Hillary Benn was to head the new food and environment ministry, hived off from Defra, was proof that the Brown government's increasingly noisy pursuit of a pro-GM agenda was to continue. After all, Benn has hardly been a friend of those who have been calling for an end to all GM experiments. 'We need to see if they have a contribution to make,' he told another conference fringe meeting, 'and we won't know the answer about their environmental impacts unless we run controlled experiments. It's important we go with the science.'</p> <p>To veteran Defra watchers, both Rooker's and Benn's comments looked like a rebuke to one of their own advisers.</p> <p>Defra's chief science officer, Professor Bob Watson, is also director of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, a global study of current farming practices and their ability to alleviate world hunger. Its final report was published in April and its conclusions on GM were not positive. There was still too much uncertainty on 'benefits and harms' and a distinct 'lack of transparent communication'. </p> <p>Again, for campaigners against GM the report was a major victory. The claims by biotech companies that GM could be a panacea for world hunger appeared to have been blown out of the water by the largest panel of international experts ever assembled. The sense that the debate was going their way was only added to over the summer, when Prince Charles accused the biotech companies of 'conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which had gone seriously wrong'.</p> <p>But then came the fightback. Both the environment minister, Phil Woolas, and science minister, Ian Pearson, made public statements demanding a debate on the virtues of GM foods. For a long time, it had seemed the debate on GM in Europe was essentially over. No new product has been passed for cultivation by the EU for 10 years: suddenly, though, it was game on.</p> <p>As the arguments raged, The Observer invited readers to have their say. We received hundreds of responses. There were a lot of predictable contributions from supporters of Friends of the Earth or Greenpeace, but there were also many from the academic community. Still, if anybody had expected the discussion to break down along equally predictable lines, with environmentalists on one side and scientists on the other, they were mistaken. The experts were manning the barricades on both sides.</p> <p>As Benn must be all too aware, the debate over GM has become all encompassing. It is about politics and the law, the role of big business and the relationship between rich and poor. But it's also about the science, for in this field almost nobody can agree on anything. And in the middle is the consumer, desperately trying to make the right choices.</p> <p>Dr Michael Antoniou was one of those scientists who contacted The Observer. As head of the Nuclear Biology Group at Guy's Hospital, and a one-time member of the government's advisory group on GM foods, he knows a lot about genetic modification. 'In our research into therapies for diseases such as multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis, we work with genetically modified organisms all the time.' It is because of that experience that he believes GM foods are potentially very dangerous.</p> <p>The problem, he argues, is the unintended consequences of genetic modification. 'It's a highly mutagenic process,' he says. 'It can cause changes in the genome that are not expected.' So far, biotech companies such as Monsanto have brought to market only four crops - maize, soya, oil seed rape and cotton - with a limited set of modifications, like pest or herbicide resistance, so weeds can be eradicated without damaging the plants. 'These crops that have come along seem to be doing what they claimed they would be doing,' he says. 'The question is what else has been done to the structure of that plant? You might inadvertently generate toxic effects.'</p> <p>The answer, surely, is that the regulatory regime is there to catch these things. No, Antoniou says, because it is not based on detailed genetic studies or even animal feeding tests. It is based on the doctrine of 'substantial equivalence', in which the original plant and its GM version are compared and, if found to be similar, passed as suitable for cultivation. It is, he argues, like comparing a conventional and nuclear weapon of the same yield and deciding they are substantially equivalent because of their explosive power.</p> <p>The most obvious response is to point out that in America, where more than 90 per cent of all soya is now GM, people have been eating the stuff for years, with no adverse effects. 'That,' he responds, 'is only because nobody is looking at what the effects might be.' In short, he considers GM a risk because nobody knows what it might be doing. Later he sends me complex academic papers on unintended consequences in GM crops. They do appear to establish mutations along the genome, but, again, the researchers cannot say for sure what the consequences of those mutations might be.</p> <p>Vivian Moses is sure he knows. A visiting professor of biotechnology at King's College London, and a member of CropGen, a pro-GM lobby group, he is experienced in arguing over the science. 'It's simply not true that there are mutations all over the genome,' he says. 'There was a paper published recently which looked at this. They found that the changes were specifically where the researchers intended them to be.' </p> <p>In any case, Moses says, resistance to GM is not merely about the science, but about perceptions of the science. He points out that in the late Nineties, GM and non-GM tomato pur\u00e9es were stocked side by side in British supermarkets for two years, and sold in similar amounts. 'The consumer saw the product and they were not put off.' Then the newspapers started filling up with headlines about 'Frankenstein foods', and the market collapsed.</p> <p>He rages against the culture of what he calls 'catastrophism and protest. There is a cultural problem that some people have. If they don't understand it they bash it.' It does seem that the anti-GM side can be prone to misunderstandings or exaggerations. For example, one briefing paper by the Soil Association referring to the same research papers on unintended consequences in the genome sent to me by Antoniou takes an unproved thesis - that unexpected mutations might cause toxic reactions - and turns it into fact. 'This,' it declares, with impressive assurance, 'explains why GMOs have been associated with allergic reactions.' When it doesn't explain anything of the sort.</p> <p>Likewise, in the late 1980s an outbreak in the US of the auto-immune illness Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome was associated with a GM version of a protein food supplement called tryptophan. The episode resulted in deaths and injuries, and is held up as the definitive example of the damage GMOs can do, despite the fact that the scientific consensus insists the genetic modification had nothing to do with it. And yet anti-GM campaigners point to it as proof while also occasionally inflating the number of deaths from the generally accepted 37 to 'around 100'.</p> <p>Most importantly, Moses says, what the oppositionists fail to recognise, indeed refuse to recognise, is that the process of genetic modification in our food crops is hardly unique. Here he is referring to the little discussed mutagenesis breeding programme that took place in the early years of the 20th century. 'Around 80 years ago researchers began to irradiate seeds and treat them with carcinogenic chemicals in the expectation they would cause mutations, some of which might be useful.' Many of these experiments produced seedlings which were useless, but a significant number were successful. 'About 70 per cent of our current crop plants have such an event in their history. Organic farmers use them by the bucket load and nobody bats an eyelid.'</p> <p>Mutagenesis breeding was haphazard. By contrast, GM processes are, he claims, very precise. He also points out that conventional plant breeding is more than capable of producing a toxic plant, like a potato with a deadly cargo of glycoalkaoids. The difference is that conventionally created plants don't need to undergo any kind of testing regime, whereas GM foods do. But isn't that testing regimen - substantial equivalence - lacking in rigour? 'The industry provides the evidence that satisfies the regulators. But biotech companies are not responsible for chasing up every wacky idea thrown its way by the anti-GM lot.'</p> <p>Moses can't hide his irritation with the anti-GM lobby; in his office at Oxford University's newly opened Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, the government's former chief scientist, Sir David King, comes across merely as frustrated. His whole argument, he says, is informed by his role as the EU adviser on African development. 'We're not starving in this country. We're not short of food. So when I suggest you should try GM tomatoes, the response is \"why should I take the slightest risk?\". It's a very different story in Africa.' He accepts that a lot of the anti-GM sentiment was caused by the bio-tech companies themselves. 'Monsanto marketed the products very vigorously in a way that had worked in the US, but here it caused great resistance and anti-American sentiment.' One of their innovations was to genetically modify a crop so it couldn't reproduce the next year, forcing farmers to restock with seed. 'And they called that the terminator gene. How stupid is that?'</p> <p>It's certainly the case that Monsanto's practices - vigorously pursuing farmers suspected of illegally planting their seeds without paying royalties through the courts, creating seed 'technology packages' that force farms into a dependence on the company - has engendered a deep mistrust. Many do not like the notion of a multinational corporation owning plant life through patents, a move that only became possible through a change in US patent law in 1980. But that, King says, should not blind people to the benefits. Britain was leading the world in this technology for many years, but a lack of consumer interest has driven companies out of the biotech business. 'The GM campaigners have won a great victory, but the cost to the economy has been enormous.'</p> <p>More importantly, he says, it risks stifling future developments. A regular battleground for both sides is whether GM foods can solve the problem of hunger that affects 850 million people. Anti-GM campaigners point out that there is no evidence GM crops improve yields. They are right; they don't, and there have even been examples of certain crops reducing yields.</p> <p>However, the reality is that none of the GM crops on the market has actually been designed to increase yields. They have been designed to reduce costs by being pest-resistant or requiring less herbicide. Higher yield crops or those that may be drought- or salt-resistant are only now being developed. 'Saying GM research should stop because it hasn't worked yet is a little like saying we haven't yet developed a malaria vaccine, so let's stop working on it. If I were a betting man, I would put serious money on the companies developing these products,' says King.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this is not an argument that holds much sway with Greenpeace. 'If these products escape and get a foothold in the environment, there's no way of containing them,' says Doug Parr, chief science officer for the organisation. 'With the environment you could even create the problem simply by testing them.' </p> <p>Hence a campaign of direct action, to rip up test fields, the most recent of which took place in Yorkshire this summer, when a field of potatoes genetically modified to cope with a form of pest was destroyed by persons unknown.</p> <p>The environmental concerns certainly deserve consideration, even if, as with so many of the arguments, they remain unproved. The notion that a pest- or herbicide-resistant crop could cross-pollinate with a weed, creating an unstoppable super-weed, remains - for the most part - theoretical. More troubling is the way some GM crops can become so popular they result in a monoculture, as happened with GM soya in Argentina from the late Nineties onwards. 'What it comes down to is, what are the risks we are running through the propagation of GM crops?' says Parr. 'Are they significantly different to those with other crops? I say yes they are.'</p> <p>Why does he think there has been a sudden upsurge in voices speaking out in favour of GM? 'It's very simple. The biotech companies want to have another go at cracking Europe.' After all, if they get Europe onside, not only do they land all those consumers; they also neuter most of the non-governmental organisations and charities that have affected the debate in Africa, where GM foods have been almost completely rejected. </p> <p>Sources in the government say there hasn't been a change in policy, that Tony Blair always saw the benefits and that this view has continued into Gordon Brown's premiership. The only change has been the resignation as science minister in 2006 of Lord Sainsbury who, because of his connections with the supermarket that carried his name, chose not to talk about GM foods at all.</p> <p>So the silence is over and the debate rages. But will it have any impact? Perhaps the answer lies back in the Pankhurst Room at Manchester's Radisson Hotel. After Jeff Rooker had spoken up in favour of GM, the other panellists were invited to weigh in, including Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium. 'We don't sell GM because no one wants it,' Opie said, simply. 'There is no demand for GM products in this country. When I am challenged by people on this, I say, \"If you think there is such a demand for GM, open a store\".' </p> <p>Don't expect to see a rash of GM-friendly supermarkets opening up in Britain any day soon.</p> <h2>What our readers think</h2> <p>Some weeks ago, in preparation for this feature, Jay Rayner posted online and asked you, our readers, to point him in the direction of good research on genetically modified foods.

  "<p>The mysterious death of an Egyptian billionaire whose body was found below his Mayfair flat just weeks after accusations that he had spied for Mossad is being investigated by a new team of murder detectives following complaints from family members that key evidence had disappeared.</p> <p>Dr Ashraf Marwan's alleged murder is now being overseen by Scotland Yard's elite Specialist Crime Directorate, after it emerged that shoes worn when he fell five floors to his death could not be found by a previous inquiry team. </p> <p>The development will only deepen speculation over his death. Israeli commentators claim he was murdered by Egyptian intelligence officers for being the Jewish state's most important agent in the run-up to the Yom Kippur war in 1973. Egyptian commentators claim he was murdered by Mossad as he prepared to expose Israel's secrets in an explosive book. </p> <p>A police source said that the case has been transferred from detectives in Westminster following fevered international speculation over Marwan's death and the admission that key evidence could not be found. 'It was decided to move this because of the intricate and public nature of the case. We need to be seen to get this right from here on in,' the source said.</p> <p>A family member claimed that a new set of detectives has taken over the case because of criticism over lost evidence. 'Scotland Yard should have changed their tactics much earlier,' he said. </p> <p>Dr Marwan, 62, a businessman and son-in-law of former Egyptian president Nasser and a former political and security adviser to President Sadat, died on 27 June, 2007 after falling from his large flat in Carlton House Terrace. He has been described by historians as the 'most infamous spy in the Middle East', who had worked closely with security agencies including MI6, the CIA and the KGB.</p> <p>His family claim that the only known copy of his nearly finished memoirs - which he had been researching for several years - disappeared from his \u00a34.4m property on the day he died. </p> <p>One witness has told police that, in the moments after Marwan's death, two men of 'Mediterranean appearance', both wearing suits, were seen peering over a balcony at his body as it lay sprawled in a private garden. </p> <p>The witness, who asked not to be identified, told The Observer last week: 'I saw two men standing on a balcony. They were doing nothing, just looking down. Their calmness struck me as unusual. A lady was screaming in the garden. People were rushing around trying to help or call. But these two men were just standing there.'</p> <p>Marwan's death came weeks after Eli Zeira, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, claimed that the billionaire was his key informant in the run-up to the Yom Kippur War. </p> <p>Family members were highly critical of the police investigation into Marwan's death after it emerged that shoes he had worn on the day he died had disappeared. The shoes were deemed to be crucial because Marwan would have had to step into a plant pot and climb over an air-conditioning unit to have jumped over the metre-high balcony rail. If he had done so, material such as soil from the plant pots or paint would have been left on his shoes. He suffered from a severe nerve condition affecting his feet and could not step into the bath without assistance.</p> <p>A source close to the investigation has also disclosed that Marwan's wife, Mona, has told police that her husband warned her three times that he might be murdered. Detectives from Belgravia, who are attached to the Specialist Crime Directorate, have recently been to New York to interview other potential witnesses.</p> <p>Police have not ruled out suicide; Marwan had a history of heart problems. He moved to Britain after Sadat's assassination in 1981. </p> <p>An inquest was due to be held last month, but was suspended because of ongoing investigations. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police admitted that the shoes worn on the day of his death had disappeared, but declined to comment on the family's complaints. </p> <p>'The reason the investigation has been handed over to the Specialist Crime Directorate is because it is a complicated case and followed a review of the file in January,' she said.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Serra's reputation precedes him: he is cerebral, single-minded, austere, as steely and uncompromising as his work. He may indeed be all these things but he is also, it turns out, a great storyteller. One of his best anecdotes concerns his turbulent years as a student at Yale in the early Sixties, where he came of age in an intensely creative milieu that included the artists Frank Stella, Chuck Close and Nancy Graves, a classmate who became his first wife. </p> <p>'I was thrown out of Yale for something real stupid,' says Serra, stern features dissolving into a childlike grin. 'Robert Rauschenberg came up there as a visiting critic. Being a bit sparky back then, I thought I'd see what he was made of. I found a chicken and tethered it to a rope and put it in this box on a pedestal. It was a kind of prank at Rauschenberg's expense, right? But when he lifted the box, the goddamn chicken flew up above him and started shitting everywhere.'</p> <p>You can see that Serra relishes the memory of that rebellious moment even though it almost cost him his scholarship. 'All the students were cracking up, and even Rauschenberg, to his credit, liked the gesture. But the faculty didn't see the joke. I was suspended for two weeks, but it was kind of worth it.' </p> <p>He pauses, still grinning, then says: 'That incident sums up my attitude: I don't give a shit but I care quite a lot.' </p> <p>Next year Serra will be 70. Like all great iconoclasts, he has lived long enough to see his supposed artistic provocations gradually accepted as groundbreaking statements. His towering curves and sheets of oxidised steel are now an artistic signature, as instantly recognisable as Giacometti's elongated figures or Rothko's swathes of deep, dark colour. When he installed his best known work, a series of huge rolled steel sculptures collectively entitled The Matter of Time in the Bilbao Guggenheim in 2005, the art historian Robert Hughes called him 'not only the best sculptor alive, but the only great one at work anywhere in the 21st century'.</p> <p>Serra's work harks back to the American Minimalist movement of the Sixties and Seventies but it often seems to have emerged from a mind in thrall to the industrial age. At times he has seemed as tough and intimidating as his steel plates, and his career has been punctuated by controversy. He once sued the American government when a public art work of his was removed from its site in New York and destroyed. He enraged the American right by creating two posters protesting against the Bush administration and the abuses at Abu Ghraib, which sold in their thousands online. 'I don't consider myself a political artist,' he tells me, 'but anything I can do to make a difference, I will. America is a right-wing country and I'm essentially from the old left.'</p> <p>Age has not withered him, nor dented what he calls, only half-jokingly, his 'sceptical negativism'. When I ask him to describe his sensibility he says: 'I have a certain obstinacy, a certain wilfulness that has got me in trouble but it has also got me through.' </p> <p>Walking into the Gagosian Gallery in King's Cross, you see immediately what Robert Hughes meant when he wrote that Serra's achievement 'has been to give fabricated steel the power and density... the sense of empathy and urgency and liberation that once belonged only to bronze and stone'. The Gagosian show is called simply Sculpture, a title that does little to prepare you for the way Serra radically transforms any context in which he places his giant steel curves. The monumental weight of these burnished sculptures is tangible as soon as you enter the space. Though big and airy, it seems barely able to contain them. </p> <p>In the main gallery there are two huge curved circles of oxidised steel, one convex, the other concave. The second is the exact inverse of the first but the experience of walking along - and around and through - each is radically different. One looms above you, the other seems in danger of falling away. One is womb-like in its sense of enclosure; the other seems to draw all the light into its centre. They seem, for all their epic tonnage, to defy logic as well as gravity. </p> <p>'Those two pieces are collecting the space in certain ways,' Serra tells me when we meet at the gallery. One suspects he could talk all day about the abstract geometry of spheres, reversed curves and torqued ellipses. 'In one, you sense the volume moving out like a giant flowerpot, or moving in like a giant lampshade. It's all about centralising the space in different ways. How people move in relation to space, that's essentially what I'm up to.' </p> <p>In an adjacent room he has installed a towering steel wall, 10 inches thick, which stands, squat and uncompromising, in the centre of the rectangular space. Like many Serra sculptures, it looks as if it might topple over with enough people leaning against it. (A rigger was crushed to death during the installation of a Serra piece in the early Seventies.) You realise, when confronted with a sculpture of such formal simplicity, such literal and metaphorical weight, that, for or all its familiarity, Serra's work still intimidates. There is something almost Orwellian about this piece, though he has named in it in honour of Fernando Pessoa, the elusive Portuguese author of a meandering, semi-mystical novel called The Book of Disquiet. He says the connection is tangential: he was reading the book while making the piece, and cautions that 'one should not read too much into my titles'. (In the past he has dedicated work to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the art critic David Sylvester.) The Pessoa piece is powerful; it brings to mind foundries and shipyards as well as the Berlin Wall and the Israeli-built security fence that snakes though Palestine. You can see why it might cause consternation to those who prefer art to be in some way uplifting. </p> <p>In the Eighties Serra created one of the most controversial works of public art of the 20th century, a curved wall of steel entitled Tilted Arc . It stood, 12 feet high and 120 feet long, in Federal Plaza in Manhattan for just eight years, while local opposition reached such a pitch that, after a combative public hearing in 1985, a jury voted that the piece should be dismantled and removed. Serra sued the federal government over the issue of ownership but, after a protracted and bitter court battle, lost his appeal. In May 1989 the piece was cut into three parts and consigned to a New York warehouse where it has languished ever since. </p> <p>'I don't think it is the function of art to be pleasing,' a bruised but bullish Serra said at the time. 'Art is not democratic. It is not for the people.' His attitude did little to endear him to the New York public, even as the contemporary art world rallied around him. </p> <p>Soon afterwards he found himself in another rancorous dispute over a big steel piece commissioned for the Sculpture Hall at Yale University. One incensed academic wrote to the local press claiming, 'Serra's pieces are about as communal as the walls of a Gulag.' He still bears the psychological scars of those epic battles. </p> <p>'That stuff hurt,' he says. 'I was standing up for a principle. Artistic ownership. It's your work; nobody has the right to destroy it. Now, if you make a work for the American government, they can dispose of it the very next day. It's unheard-of.' </p> <p>For a long time Serra's work was held to illustrate the tensions that surround public art, its funding, its responsibility and its execution. 'Up until about 10 years ago I got a lot of stick,' he says. 'It reached a crescendo of sorts around Tilted Arc. At one point they had posters plastered all over my work with a picture of the Vietnamese guy being shot in the head and a sign underneath that said, \"Kill Serra\". People were threatening to kill me because I was making art in New York City. That's a little bit extreme, right?' </p> <p>Now, older and wiser but still combative, he senses a sea change in both the critical and public response to his work. What does he think caused the shift in attitude? How did he go from, as one critic put it, 'being a steely pariah to New York's favourite sculptor'? </p> <p>He doesn't even have to think about the answer. 'It was the curves,' he says, laughing. 'It was definitely the curves. When I showed the first series of Torqued Ellipses in New York 10 years ago there was a definite sense that people were reacting to the work in a different way. People reacted to the curves in a way they didn't to the angles and straight lines. They hadn't seen that before. Modernism was a right angle; the whole 20th century was a right angle.'</p> <p>Nodding his head as if in complete agreement with himself, he concludes: 'People were ready for curves.' </p> <p>Richard Serra was born in San Francisco in 1939, the second of three sons to a Spanish mother and a Russian-Jewish father. Both his parents were left-leaning and he remembers two of his uncles, who worked on the piers, shooting at each other in a long-running row over union politics. 'It was a lively environment,' he laughs. 'I grew up poor but the atmosphere was rich. There always seemed to be political discussions in the house, debates about what sort of life you should live. Where you come from confers meaning on what you do, and that's how it was for me, I guess. I'm single-minded, that's for sure.' </p> <p>He inherited his single-mindedness, he says, from his mother, who steered all her sons into higher education. His brother Tony has since made a name for himself as one of San Francisco's most radical attorneys, famously defending the Black Panther leader, Huey Newton, as well as the late-Sixties urban guerrilla group the Symbionese Liberation Army, who kidnapped the heiress Patty Hearst. </p> <p>At Yale, where he studied painting and paid his way by working in a steel mill, Serra seems to have taken most of his inspiration from the artists who taught there. He singles out Philip Guston and the experimental composer Morton Feldman as 'guiding lights' who, he says, 'didn't try and lay their shtick on you'. </p> <p>After the Rauschenberg spat, a Fulbright grant took him in 1964 to Paris, where he visited Brancusi's studio and hung out nightly at the cafe La Coupole, waiting for glimpses of his hero, Alberto Giacometti. The great sculptor 'would turn up for a drink late at night with plaster in his hair'. He later described both artists as 'empowering figures'.</p> <p>Serra's 'big epiphany as an artist' occurred when, on a fleeting visit to Spain, he saw Velazquez's astonishing painting Las Meninas for the first time. It is a group portrait, in which the artist has placed himself in the background, poised at his easel, his gaze directed back out at the viewer. 'I was still very young and trying to be a painter, and it just knocked me sideways,' he says. 'I looked at it for a long time before it hit me that I was an extension of the painting. This was incredible to me. A real revelation. I had not seen anything like it before and it made me think about art, and about what I was doing, in a radically different way. But first, it just threw me into state of total confusion.' </p> <p>For a while afterwards, he made some very odd installation pieces deploying a variety of stuffed animals and, in one instance, a live pig. He was lost, he says, but on his way to reinventing himself as an artist whose work would hinge on the idea of 'the viewer being the subject of the piece'. He says he is still grappling with to that idea today. 'In my later work, the person who is navigating the space, his or her experience becomes the content. So, the whole subject-object relationship is reversed. The content is you! If you don't walk into the work and engage with it, there isn't any content. That's really what I've been dealing with ever since I saw the Velazquez painting.'</p> <p>In mid-to-late Sixties New York, Serra became part of a small but enduringly influential downtown underground art scene that included Chuck Close, the writer Spalding Gray and the minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich. He mostly hung out with dancers from the Judson Church group, including Yvonne Rainer and Serra's one-time partner Joan Jonas. 'The dancers were the real radicals. They taught me more about space and movement and gravity than anyone else.' </p> <p>To fund his art, Serra started a furniture-removals business, Low-Rate Movers, and employed most of his struggling friends. For a while Philip Glass worked as his assistant, helping him install shows and lug furniture up and down the steps of brownstones. 'It was an extraordinary time, idealistic, communal, generous. I suppose it was a kind of radical underground scene insofar as we rejected the mainstream. If you sold out a show it was as if you'd actually sold out. Everyone would commiserate. The way we saw it was that if the dealers and the collectors liked the work it couldn't possibly be radical.' </p> <p>He shakes his head and a wry grin spreads across his tough-guy face. 'It was the exact opposite of now. These days it's all about selling, all about the market value. Some time in the Eighties artists became Hollywood-style stars. The personalities started to take precedence over the work.'</p> <p>In 1970 Serra helped his close friend the late Robert Smithson to 'lay out' Spiral Jetty, Smithson's seminal earthwork that coils out into the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 'When Robert died,' he says, 'I felt like I had lost a brother. He was a guy I could get dead drunk with, and have a huge fight with, then wake up in the morning and straight away be friends with again. I still miss that deep connection we had.' </p> <p>Serra has been married for 30 years to Clara Weyergraf, and they divide their time between Tribeca, New York and Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. When he was recently made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French Academy, the City of Paris restored one of his earlier works, Clara Clara, to its original site in the Tuileries gardens. But this work has also become problematic, having since been marked around its base by the dusty footprints of lounging youths. 'It bothers me a lot the way they put their feet on it,' Serra told the New York Times recently. 'But I haven't gone up to anyone to pull them away.'</p> <p>Like the great American novelist Philip Roth, who possesses a similarly sceptical, combative sensibility, Serra has greeted the onset of old age with a burst of renewed creative intensity. There have been two big shows, last year's 40-year retrospective at Moma in New York, and this year's opening exhibition for the Monumenta event at the Grand Palais in Paris. </p> <p>'Man, that was a tightrope walk,' he says. 'There was no way to mock it up, so vast was the space. We didn't know if the piece would work until the first plate went up. It was one of the most glorious experiences of my life when I saw that it was working.

  "<p>The forecast was for a month's worth of the wet stuff to fall on parts of Wales inside just 24 hours. And how Swansea rained on Wolverhampton's parade as Mick McCarthy's side suffered a second comprehensive league defeat within four days, surrendering top spot in the Championship to neighbours Birmingham City in the process. </p> <p>Yes, there were mitigating circumstances. Wolves had key men out either injured or suspended, leading scorer Chris Iwelumo belonging in the latter bracket. But even at full strength, Wanderers would probably have struggled to live with the lively Welshmen, who went in front after 25 seconds and completely tore the visitors apart with a scintillating second-half performance that belied their mid-table position. The vast gaps in the away end well before the final whistle said it all.</p> <p>'There's two sides to every football match - Roberto [Mart\u00ednez, the Swansea manager] would have been thrilled with the goals he's got, rightfully so, whereas I, as the defeated manager, am disappointed to concede after 40 seconds,' said McCarthy, his timing slightly askew, before throwing in a reality check aimed at those eager to write off his team. 'Twenty-two points from 10 games and second, aren't we? If that's a crisis, then roll on the next crisis.' </p> <p>Many supporters were still taking their seats when Jordi G\u00f3mez turned a statuesque Wolves defence and slipped the ball past second-choice goalkeeper Carl Ikeme, the highly rated Welsh international Wayne Hennessey having been dropped by McCarthy following a rare mistake against Reading last Tuesday.</p> <p>Although Wanderers pulled level after 17 minutes through an Andy Keogh effort that Dorus de Vries should have saved, Swansea calmly went about trying to re-establish their lead. </p> <p>Jason Scotland had a shot cleared off the line by Kevin Foley. Mark Gower's right-foot drive was chalked off, having been touched on its way into the net by G\u00f3mez in an offside position. Scotland's header from a corner bounced back off the crossbar. </p> <p>And so it went on until four minutes before the break when Scotland finally stole a yard on the advancing Ikeme to restore Swansea's advantage. </p> <p>Eight minutes into the second half McCarthy threw on Sam Vokes in an attempt to turn things around. The Welsh striker almost scored with his first touch, a close-range shot that was beaten away by De Vries. But from that point on, the game belonged to Swansea. </p> <p>The only surprise was that they scored just one more goal. Mind you, what a goal it was - Scotland twisting on the edge of the penalty area in the 57th minute before unleashing a stunning left-foot drive which gave Ikeme no chance. 'You're worse than Cardiff City,' bragged the home fans, the ultimate insult in west Wales. </p> <p>'To test your squad against the league leaders was going to be a huge challenge,' Mart\u00ednez said. 'I'm delighted at the way we've been able to defend, the way we've been able to soak up the pressure Wolves put us under and then play our football on top. Overall, I think that has been a complete performance and a really pleasing afternoon.'</p> <p><strong>The Liberty Stadium 17,556</strong></p> <p><strong> Referee </strong>Trevor Kettle</p>",
  "<p>Howard Jacobson never strays far from the obsessional. His last, wonderful book, Kalooki Nights, made wicked transgressive comedy out of growing up Jewish in Manchester. Its hero, a neurotic cartoonist, was so transfixed by the Holocaust that he could not marry anyone who did not have an umlaut in her name. When he looked at the love lines on his wives' palms, he saw the train tracks running to Auschwitz. When his marriages faltered, he was haunted by erotic fantasies of Ilse Koch, the torturing 'witch of Buchenwald'. No other British novelist could have got away with this as comedy; that Jacobson could also make it both poignant and profound showed the depth of his gifts..</p> <p>The Act of Love is a less ambitious book, but it is no less compulsive. He has traded the loud and louche voice of his last narrator for something more exact and pinched. Felix Quinn is from a long line of antiquarian booksellers - Jacobson always likes to give his narrators a plausible excuse to display his own erudition. Quinn is a connoisseur of many things, but mostly he is a master of the pain of jealousy. This predilection for the agonies of love comes 'partly from an extensive and perhaps over-collaborative' reading of classic literature whose subject is humiliation, whether the sorrows of Young Werther or the self-inflicted tragedy of Othello. </p> <p>Quinn needs to share that pain. He was born, he believes, lovesick and he wants no cure. 'I rubbed at the pain in my heart,' he says, with typical mock melodrama. 'Probed it, polished it, until there was no skin left between my heart and me.' Marisa is his idealised woman, life-breakingly beautiful and resolutely unfaithful. He marries her and sets about engineering his consummating torment. Quinn's life's work is to find his wife the perfect lover. There are some false starts. The newlyweds join a dance class but only so Quinn can arrive late in the hope of finding Marisa 'tangoing like a mare on heat with the new teacher, an Argentinian with punched-out eyes and a ponytail'.</p> <p>Eventually, though, he finds his man. Marius is Much Wenlock's answer to Heathcliff, brooding and muscular. 'He was a character in a fiction I wrote,' Quinn observes, delighted and appalled, 'in imitation of all the salacious fiction I'd ever read [and what fiction isn't salacious?].'</p> <p>Marius gives Quinn the means to enact the dilemma posed in his favourite book of all, Pierre Klossowski's Roberte Ce Soir (Quinn is nothing if not an intellectual snob): 'How do you take a woman in your arms when you want it to be someone else who takes her in his arms and you aspire to see him in the very moment he sees you?' How to be both voyeur and actor? Quinn isn't quite sure, but this being a Jacobson novel, he is certainly prepared to give it a right good go. </p> <p>There are elements of desperate bedroom farce in what follows, though the context of the drama is, in Quinn's head at least, one of powerful erotic earnestness. Jacobson is as preoccupied as any Jacobean playwright by intertwined thoughts of sex and death. His tone is always full of wit and darkness and he has some clever points to make about the nature of novels themselves, bodice-rippers and high art both, notably how they make creepy voyeurs of us all.</p> <p>Quinn's imagined deviance is all about control; like Max Mosley in his West End dungeon, he is the one humiliated, but the choreography of that humiliation is, he believes, all his own work. As a novelist, control is very close to Jacobson's heart, too - he is an arch manipulator, able to lead his reader into disturbing territory and keep him or her laughing all the while. The last chapter is what gives this novel its bite. It's the comeuppance of the control freak, where everything spins into chaos and sadness and messy life reasserts itself. Or, at least, in this expertly self-conscious act of fiction, that is what Jacobson would, finally, have you believe.</p>",
  "<p>There can be few writers so adept at catching the American mood as Thomas Friedman. In The Lexus and the Olive Tree, published in 1999, the influential New York Times columnist celebrated globalisation in triumphal fin-de-si\u00e8cle fashion as a process whose end-point is universal Americanisation. The paean continued in The World Is Flat, which appeared in 2005, but by then globalisation was not looking so unambiguously benign and the subtext of Friedman's jubilation was the threat it was posing to the American way of life. One of the book's messages was that the US needed to reduce its dependency on imported oil. </p> <p>American 'energy independence' would allow the US to delink itself from the global market. In this way, the prophet of globalisation seemed to be suggesting, the US could turn its back on the frighteningly unAmerican world that globalisation was actually producing.</p> <p>Friedman's latest book synthesises ideas that have been floating around in America ever since the scale of the disaster in Iraq became undeniable. Supporters of the war believed that once Iraq's oil had been seized and privatised, the price of oil would come down, with Paul Wolfowitz arguing that the invasion would be self-financing and result in a global economic boom. In fact, exploiting Iraq's oil assets proved very difficult, production was lower than under Saddam and the oil price spiralled upwards. </p> <p>At this point, even neoconservatives, who had hitherto looked on green thinking as a dastardly leftist plot, became interested in energy conservation. Not himself a neocon - on many issues his views are liberal, even social democrat - Friedman was at one with the neo-cons in urging a fundamental rethink of American environmental policies. Hot, Flat and Crowded is the result. </p> <p>The book is archetypal Friedman. Breathlessly upbeat in style, seemingly written in a succession of airport lounges, it is a compendium of the bullish delusions of US politics over the past two decades. He instructs the reader in what he calls 'the First Law of Petro-Politics', which says that when the price of oil goes down, freedom goes up. A drop in the price of oil to $20 a barrel will trigger democratic revolutions throughout the Gulf, he believes, and in one sense he is right. A collapse in the oil price would destabilise existing regimes and might well result in a spread of democracy. But in most cases, certainly in Saudi Arabia, which remains vital to Western oil supplies, it would be an Islamist version of democracy, hostile to Western interests, that would come to power. </p> <p>Friedman makes much of the example of Bahrain, where he tells us the prospect of oil running out is leading to democratic reforms. But the upshot of this democratisation is unclear and the so-called Law of Petro-Politics is in general not much more than a formula for wishful thinking. </p> <p>At other times, Friedman is refreshingly realistic. 'Rapid economic growth and population expansion,' he writes, 'are driving the destruction of forests and other ecosystems at unprecedented rate. The destruction of these forests and biodiversity-rich environments, in turn, contributes to climate change by releasing more carbon in the atmosphere.' Here Friedman recognises the interconnections that underlie the environmental crisis and which necessitate a shift in our whole way of doing things. He is robust in recognising that any effective response to climate change must include hi-tech solutions such as nuclear power, although his proposal for an 'Energy Internet' ('one big seamless platform for using, storing, generating and even buying and selling clean electrons') sounds impractical. A large-scale fusion of information technology and energy technology could have many benefits, but in a world of states competing for energy resources, and using these resources as geopolitical levers, there is no prospect of such a scheme operating at the global level. Even so, Friedman's focus on technical fixes for environmental problems is closer to reality than mainstream green thinking, which clings to a utopian faith in political transformation.</p> <p>Friedman's discussion of the environmental challenges facing the world contains valuable insights. Yet in the context of the book as a whole, these insights are almost inadvertent. Hot, Flat and Crowded is only incidentally about the environment. As is always the case with Friedman, its real subject is not the world, but America. The concluding paragraph is toe curling in its parochialism: 'We need to redefine green and rediscover America and in so doing rediscover ourselves and what it means to be Americans. We are all Pilgrims again. We are all sailing on the Mayflower anew.' </p> <p>An Americo-centric perspective of this kind might have made some sense 20 years ago. In today's world, where the US is a tottering power, it is comically deluded. It is not America that will decisively shape the global response to climate change and energy crisis. It is emerging nations, above all China, which is definitely not sailing on the Mayflower. True, Friedman gives China's rulers grudging praise for their environmental awareness, but only on condition that China ends up being more like America: 'They will never say so, but I do not think they can go green without, over time, going at least a little orange - \u00e0 la the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004'.</p> <p>Since that was written, events have altered the picture. Russia's self-assertion in the Caucasus has revealed the geo-political forces that are shaping world politics and the future of the orange revolutions is looking less assured than it did only months ago. More to the point, at least from Friedman's navel-gazing perspective, Americans now have other concerns. The environmental anxieties that followed the Iraq debacle are fading, along with the war itself, from the centre of American politics. The struggle to avert a catastrophic depression is now all-consuming. The American psyche is grappling with a well-founded fear of economic collapse and it is hard to see it being energised by Friedman's green-tinged nationalism.</p> <p>The upshot cannot be known, but as fear tightens its grip, drilling for oil off its coastlines and reopening coal mines may be what the US resorts to. History has moved on, the American mood has shifted and for once Friedman has been left behind.</p> <h2>Global affairs: three to read</h2> <p><strong>The Wrecking Crew by Thomas Frank </strong>(Harvill Secker) <br>A primer on American conservatism, revealing the corruption and self-interest at the heart of the movement that has been the ascendant force in US politics for three decades.</p> <p><strong>The Post-American World by Fareed Zakaria </strong>(Allen Lane)<br>The editor of Newsweek argues that American power may be waning, but this is no bad thing; if the US learns how to broker and mediate, it can remain a force for good. </p> <p><strong>What Next: Surviving the Twenty-First Century by Chris Patten </strong>(Allen Lane) <br>The former governor of Hong Kong identifies and offers 'rational' solutions to the many challenges facing the world, from climate change to drug trafficking.</p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia is published by Penguin</p>",
  "<p>I've been performing striptease a long time, and I've lost a few men along the way who were afraid or intimidated by what I did. They couldn't cope with other people watching me. There have been a few who couldn't make it past the first performance. I can't see them in the audience when I have the spotlight shining in my eyes, but afterwards I always recognise whether they have the confidence to be with a woman like me.</p> <p>I have given a lot of men a hard time in my life. My first love was when I was 15. He was slightly embarrassed to be seen with me sometimes, because I really liked dressing up, and it was hard for a 16-year-old lifeguard walking hand-in-hand with a girl with a blonde beehive and red lips. But we were very much in love. I wore stockings and garter belts, and he must have thought that this was just what girls wore, what girls did. I wonder sometimes how that's shaped him. I got really experimental with my hair and make-up when I was 19, going out with my second boyfriend. I was influenced by Marlene Dietrich, I wore men's tuxedos, and I dyed my hair black. He freaked out. Throughout my life, men have always fought my eccentric looks, I must be very clear on that. </p> <p>I grew up watching Forties movies with my mother in Michigan, looking at the stars and being completely fascinated by the way they were painted up to be like glamorous cartoon characters. Glamour is a difficult thing to define, which is what makes it interesting. For me it's about being different from everyone else. I've always been very shy, and I was able to be more bold with the way that I look than the way that I acted with people.</p> <p>I admire men who have a personal style that doesn't change or falter depending on what I'm wearing, because in relationship after relationship I find that men change to accommodate the way I dress. But I like someone who's comfortable in their own style. I'm just as happy with the guy in a polo shirt as with the guy in a suit. </p> <p>I wish I knew what men wanted. They seem to love an independent woman until they lose control of her. I went through a short period of having relationships with women, but it was more about my retaliation against a boyfriend whose attention I couldn't keep. It was complicated. I realised I wasn't cut out for it. I never had posters of famous men on my wall - I had pictures of ballerinas and women I wanted to be like. All my friends were in love with Johnny Depp, and I never got it until I met him, and realised he was the most fascinating man on the face of the planet. Sure, he's dashing, but he, and George Clooney, too, both have that old-fashioned glamour of a man like Rudolph Valentino.</p> <p>I don't claim to be a good judge of character in relationships. I get so nervous when I'm attracted to someone that I can't talk. I'm so scared of rejection - I'm not good around boys. But I'm single for the first time now, and allowing men to bring me a lot of pleasure. Whenever I'm in a relationship I am blind to everyone else in the world, and all the chapters in my life are defined by my relationships. With my marriage [to rocker Marilyn Manson, which ended after a year, in 2007], I believe that everything happened for a reason, and I don't think I had the power to change anything. I did my very best. </p> <p>I started thinking, recently, about everyone's quests for the happily-ever-after, and I related it to my idols. None of them, I realised, had just one important relationship. They all had many great loves, and that made me more accepting of my relationship defeats and failures.</p> <p>\u2022 Dita Von Teese's collection for Wonderbra is available now; <a href=\"http://www.wonderbra.co.uk/dita\">www.wonderbra.co.uk/dita</a></p>",
  "<p>After a month of the Premiership season, this was a chance for teams that have not exactly started with aplomb to relaunch their campaigns. It is the way the seasons goes: a month of Guinness, a couple of rounds of EDF, and then the Heineken Cup, with each chunk offering its own new dawn, its fresh point of restart. </p> <p>Wasps at this rate will go through the cliches tenfold, such is their inability to reproduce the form that made them champions last season, the rhythms that sustained them as the perennially formidable force of the English club game. They were in poorly condition coming into this competition - they withdrew Danny Cipriani from the bench in the morning - and they are no better now. They still need a boost from someone... anyone </p> <p>Gloucester have not exactly been models of high achievement either, and they started as if it was they, not their visitors, who were in a trough. They threw long into a line-out, even though the trees behind the Shed were already bending in the wind, and watched Wasps steal the wobbling ball and pass it down the line. </p> <p>Mark Robinson did more than watch the ball's progress. Shrewd old Kiwi that the scrum-half is, he judged where it might end up and set off for that point. The ball, thanks to Dominic Waldouck straightening the line in the narrowest of channels, duly went where it was supposed to, and Robinson scooped it up a yard from the line and went through Lesley Vainikolo's challenge to score. </p> <p>It looked bad for the home team and for the wing, who had been in and out of the starting line-up in the Premiership. But whereas Robinson found himself increasingly uncomfortable behind a pack that undid every bit of good work with a string of conceded penalties and unforced errors, Vainikolo grew in stature. </p> <p>Even before he was required, Gloucester had stabilised themselves, Willie Walker landing a penalty and Ryan Lamb dropping a goal for a narrow lead. Then came Vainikolo's chance. Gloucester surged forward, first through the middle, then towards the opposite wing, before Lamb placed a kick behind what remained of the defence for his man on the left wing to chase the ball, stop, write a postcard, drink half a cup of tea and then touch it down. Wasps have built a formidable reputation on stinginess and cruelty, on shutting down their opponents in an instant, but this was altogether too generous. </p> <p>Lawrence Dallaglio has of course gone. It might be said that for the last two years of his career he was in such decline that he was not always present in body. But his mind was always there, forcing others to obey his will. His leadership is missing. </p> <p>So is the defensive contribution of Fraser Waters, a more unsung general at the heart of the Wasps success story. Whatever system the Premiership champions are trying to develop in the absence of the centre, it lacks the bite of old. Wasps have not rattled the bones of their opponents this season. </p> <p>They did manage to score a freakish try to cut the deficit before half time. At a ruck near the line they seemed to lose control of the ball, a touch of try-anxiety close to the score that might transform their season. </p> <p>James Haskell eventually took control of the situation and telescoped his arms over the line, but there was enough doubt about the build-up that referee Martin Fox referred it to the television match official. Replays revealed at least one knock on, but such infringements lie beyond the remit of the reviewer. The elastic finish by Haskell was good; the try was awarded. </p> <p>A penalty apiece left the teams a point apart at the interval, but it would be along time before Wasps threatened again. The wind grew and the rain began to fall, plunging the game into a general scruffiness. </p> <p>Gloucester did enough before the weather and rugby deteriorated to make an about-turn almost impossible. A cut-out pass - possibly a tad forward - by Lamb put Vainikolo clear. This was surely a time for the wing to indulge in his speciality, the slaughter of defenders before him. But Lesley displayed his delicate side and placed a sweet little pass into the arms of Walker. It was rather touching. </p> <p>Penalties were exchanged, errors were repeated, offences compounded, ground gained and surrendered. It was very untidy, but at least Dave Walder's penalty - he came on to replace Rob Hoadley - meant that the game could yet be snatched. The assault never really came. The sting seems to have gone out of these Wasps.</p> <p><strong>Kingsholm</strong> 7,864</p> <p><strong>Gloucester </strong>Walker; Foster, Adams, Tindall, Vainikolo; Lamb, R Lawson; Dickinson, Azam (S Lawson 49), Young, Bortolami (Eustace 47), Brown, Satala (Buxton 52), Hazell, Strokosch</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Vainikolo, Walker <strong>Con</strong> Walker <strong>Pens</strong> Walker 3 <strong>Drop goal</strong> Lamb</p> <p><strong>Wasps </strong>Mitchell; Odejobi, Hoadley (Walder 56), Waldouck, Voyce; Staunton, Robinson (Reddan 47); French (Beech 74), Webber, Holford, Shaw, Birkett, Haskell, Betsen (Leo 64), Worsley</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Robinson, Haskell <strong>Pens</strong> Staunton 2, Walder</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>Martin Fox</p>",

What is needed is a technologically advanced, wealth-creating base with the social and economic institutions to support it.<br><strong>George Hudson</strong><br>Worcester</p> <p>David Cameron shouldn't overlook another class of 'banking crisis' culprits, namely the Big Four accountancy firms ('The Tories must condemn the City's moral failure', last week). The irony is that the Big Four are immediate beneficiaries of the banking crisis through their insolvency and advisory functions even though, in their primary role as auditors, they turned a blind eye to imprudent lending by banks.</p> <p>Those banks deemed too large to fail should have their accounts audited by a government agency which would, in effect, act for taxpayers who would no longer pay for the banking sector's excesses.<br><strong>Yugo Kovach</strong><br>Twickenham, west London</p> <p>As the former 'masters of the universe' depart their gilded towers, you'll forgive me if I don't join in the lamentations ('Fears of the fallen high-fliers', Business, last week).</p> <p>One recalls the words of St Matthew: 'And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</p> <p>I recall no weeping and gnashing of teeth in the City when the coal mining industry was devastated by the ill-considered application of a flawed economic ideology. </p> <p>The consequence of that arrogant idiocy now leaves us dependent for the major part of this country's energy supplies on sources over which we have no control.</p> <p>I suggest the former 'masters of the universe' reflect on the fate of that original high flier, Icarus, who went too close to the Sun.<br><strong>Chris Waller</strong><br>Bristol</p> <p>Brown and Cameron have but one aim: to get elected.

  "<p>We are now several weeks into the weird humiliation that the Republican party inflicted upon us Americans with their choice of Sarah Palin as their nominee for Vice-President. Here we are, at as precarious a crossroad as history is ever likely to offer up, yet there stands Sarah Palin regurgitating George W Bush's 'good guys-bad guys' baby talk. I despair. </p> <p>When I hear her failing to recall the name of a single newspaper she'd ever read, I feel willing to offer up my teenage son as a sacrifice to the Republican party; he could serve in her stead with so much more fluency. When she prattles smoothly yet non-responsively to questions about the war, economics or foreign policy - or when she brightly changes the subject altogether - I want to weep.</p> <p>Palin is a never-ending train wreck of ignorance, inconsistency, outright contradiction and sneering. During her debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, she chatted up soccer moms and hockey moms, her mom and her pop and, by golly, yours too. She winked and she dimpled and 'goshed' and 'doggoned' it. She gave a 'shout-out' to some third graders in Wasilla, promising 'extra credit' for staying up to listen. </p> <p>Less remarked upon was the substance. Despite the enormous variety of public crises we face, she dismissed virtually all forms of government regulation by invoking 'private contract' rather than collective duty; 'personal responsibility' rather than public oversight; and 'tolerance' rather than civil rights. She misspoke the name of a commanding general, she went unchallenged when she expressed her arch-creationist belief that humanity has had no hand in global warming, tucking all that away cosily but dismissively: 'I don't wanna argue about causes.'</p> <p>Similarly, Palin was unchallenged in her head-spinning assertions about the powers of the vice-presidency, endorsing an unqualified 'flexibility' possibly exceeding Dick Cheney's assertion of a vastly expanded, alarmingly imperial concept of a 'unitary executive'. At the same time, her answers were so vague and addled that it was hard to tell if she actually knew what she was saying.</p> <p>Yet the morning after the debate with Biden, polls showed that the race was still too close to call. If Biden 'won' based on knowledge and experience, it was not by enough of a margin to inspire a significant shift. Indeed, pundits of all political persuasions were dissecting Palin's ability to 'hold her own' as though it were an actual measure of whether she could run the republic. Pat Buchanan, gleeful mouthpiece of the far right, celebrated Palin as 'a fresh voice' with a 'new vocabulary'. 'She tossed away the questions,' he gloated as though this were a good thing. 'She answered what she wanted to.'</p> <p>Presenters on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel lined up to decry the way 'we journalists' tend to 'value knowledgeability' while true Americans 'connect to her style'. Greta Van Susteren, an experienced lawyer and ubiquitous television commentator, opined: 'Whether I agree with her or not, the important thing is whether she's plain-talking ... I may have had the fancy education, but I love the plain talk, the direct words. I'm a Midwesterner.' (Whew. Whatever is the value of a fancy education if not to inoculate against such blather?)</p> <p>The enthusiasm for the Alaskan governor reminds me of an exercise I once conducted with students. I played them a segment of the 2007 debate between S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy. Very few understood French, so it was effectively an exercise in reading body language. They were convinced that Royal had won the argument because she seemed 'emphatic' and 'passionate' and 'repeated her points a lot'.</p> <p>The clip I had played, however, was Royal's least convincing moment in that debate: she was delivering a mawkish, inappropriately long-winded tongue-lashing about Sarkozy's purported failure to tackle the plight of handicapped children. Although her body language might have telegraphed earnest conviction, the words she was repeating with such focused intensity were something along the lines of: 'I am not going to pieces, I am angry, I am angry, I am angry.'</p> <p>Even if one's political sympathies lay with Royal, it was clear why that encounter might have lost her the election. My students accurately translated Royal's passion and conviction. They also accurately translated Sarkozy's discomfort at that moment. But without an understanding of the substance of what was said, it would be impossible to see how much her words contradicted the commanding body language. </p> <p>The enthusiastic responses to Palin's presentations remind me of that exercise. Yes, Palin's delivery is perky and self-assured. But if one pays attention to the substance, it's impossibly vacuous. That so few do pay attention makes me think that listening to the debates must be like a foreign language for some of my compatriots. Perhaps this is laziness or political illiteracy. Perhaps it's a failure of education. Perhaps there's a measure of raw racism: better to vote for anyone other than the black guy. Or perhaps it's a manifestation of gender fundamentalism, by which any biological formation of a woman can stand in for Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>At least as distracting are the polarities jumbling American political discourse: i.e. not just good versus evil, male versus female, black versus white, but eastern elitism versus western frontier spirit; secular humanism versus speaking-in-tongues theocracy; scientism versus creationism; 'tolerance' versus equal rights; ultra-libertarianism versus civic engagement. </p> <p>The Republicans' best operatives have been playing these tensions against each other for decades. Against the backdrop of such a frighteningly incoherent cultural landscape, Sarah Palin plays Mom. She speaks to us in a wipe-your-nose and sit-up-straight inflection that is quite Orwellian - if Orwell had anticipated that newspeak might come packaged as old-fashioned-country-horse-sense speak.</p> <p>And so we love her, Mother Sarah. She's simple, she's pretty, she's as fierce as a tiger protecting her cubs. So what if storms are rattling the windowpanes? We get a glass of warm milk and a big gold star just for staying up late while she tells us reassuring bedtime stories.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation magazine</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow evening in America, women's football fans will sit down in front of their television screens to watch the draft for the new Women's Professional Soccer league, followed by a live phone-in and discussion on Fox Sports.</p> <p>It is a scenario that women's football fans in this country can only dream of. In England it is still a major coup to be able to watch live games on TV, let alone football discussion shows at prime time. The difference will be more marked still when the US launch their revamped professional league in April, having targeted some of the best players in the world - including two-time Fifa world player of the year Brazil forward Marta - and England stars Kelly Smith and Karen Carney.</p> <p>With the FA's announcement of plans for a summer Super League to be launched in 2010, including central contracts for England players, and Hope Powell's England side qualifying for the European Championships last week, it is a buoyant time for the women's game. But compared with what is going on around the world, is enough really being done to elevate women's football in England?</p> <p>Already Sweden's most successful team, Umea IK, pay professional wages to 75 per cent of their players and rival men's teams in terms of their TV coverage, many of Germany's players have semi-professional status, Holland's new league is tied to and funded by the men's Eredivisie so that women footballers have their playing expenses covered, and Australia's new W-League is fully professional. English domestic football could end up playing a frustrating game of catch up.</p> <p>Sue Tibballs, chief executive of the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation, is measured in her assessment. 'What the FA are proposing is a great first step, but it's a cautious one. They could actually take a few big strides, and then you'd suddenly see the thing taking off.'</p> <p>At the newly franchised Chicago Red Stars, head coach Emma Hayes - former assistant coach at Arsenal ladies - is frustrated by the gulf in ambition between US and English football. She says the English approach to developing the game is 'Victorian'.</p> <p>'Working in women's sport in England is so hard, it's draconian,' says Hayes, who reluctantly left Arsenal at the end of last season fearing a dead end in the domestic game. 'Arsenal is my club and I love it more than anything else, it's in my blood, but I want to be the best coach in the world and that's why I came here. This country loves women's football. Loves it.'</p> <p>While Hayes welcomes the FA's announcement, she is concerned the proposals will not do enough. 'If we're going to do it let's do it properly with long-term intentions and not just knee-jerk reactions to a few players being targeted by another league. I hope the FA get their act together. They have enough money to do it, they just don't want to consider financing it.'</p> <p>The current proposals will cost an estimated \u00a31m-\u00a32m a year including central contracts at around \u00a316,000 per player, although this last figure is unconfirmed by the FA. It is a modest outlay for an organisation with an annual turnover nearing \u00a3240m and a pittance compared with WPS budgets of around \u00a31.5m per club, plus the added benefit of sharing facilities and costs with Major League Soccer clubs.</p> <p>The introduction of salaries for England players is a huge development - with many top footballers currently paying to play - but Hayes says it falls short. 'Yes it's great they're supporting national team players but is it really viable? Why would [England footballer] Rachel Yankey give up her business interests [coaching schools] for \u00a316,000? And what about the other players who won't be paid?'</p> <p>The salaries are part of an incentive to keep young talent in the game as well as preventing England's best players from being lured Stateside. The words 'danger' and 'threat' have been on everybody's lips after WPS approaches, and when Kelly Smith admitted being open to a return to America - she played for Philadelphia Charge in 2001 under the previous WPS incarnation - feathers were ruffled.</p> <p>But Hayes believes the focus is all wrong. 'Their initial reaction is they don't want to lose players, but it's great that women footballers are in positions of choice, it's improving the game worldwide. That should be the bigger picture. You can't have a stranglehold on players.'</p> <p>WPS commissioner Tonya Antonucci says she expects English football fans will be 'delighted' to see their players competing in the new league.</p> <p>'It's an opportunity to watch great soccer first and foremost, but we're also providing a platform for players to improve their games and to grow the sport as a whole.' Antonucci says the league should act as a 'beacon' for the rest of the world, and could include international club competitions in future.</p> <p>The global approach seems to have bypassed domestic football here. The English league is not attracting players from outside the British Isles, European footballers don't want to come here, and players outside the EU cannot come because of immigration laws and the non-professional status of clubs. Hayes believes this must change. 'I get approached all the time by quality American footballers who would love to play in England, but we're losing them to Finland and Sweden. We should be challenging that legislation, or finding a way around it.</p> <p>'I want to come home at some point,' says Hayes, 'I really do. But I'm here to improve my country and I want to learn everything I can before I return. I just wish that same learning intention was adopted back home.'</p> <p>After a meeting between the FA and women's Premier League clubs yesterday, an FA spokeswoman said: 'This is the start of something really exciting for women's football in England. We have a well-thought-out approach, not a knee-jerk reaction. We have done a lot of research and this is the start of a four-year strategy for women's football.'</p>",
  "<p>Jelena Jankovic, the world number two, beat world number eight Venus Williams 7-6 5-7 2-6 to reach today's final with Russia's Nadia Petrova in the Stuttgart Grand Prix. The Serb, now up 5-3 in their head-to-head match-ups, lost a hard-fought first set in the tiebreak, but came back to take the second with a single break of serve. In the final set, she beat the American handily, breaking serve on match point to complete the win.</p> <p>Petrova advanced with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. Petrova, the 2006 Stuttgart champion, caught Azarenka cold at the start of the match, building a 4-0 lead before her opponent fought back. Azarenka recovered one of those breaks and had Petrova under pressure again in her next service game, only for two huge aces to get the Russian out of trouble. After an exchange of breaks, Petrova took control of the second set when she moved 4-3 up with serve and that advantage proved enough to carry her to victory in 90 minutes.</p> <p>Czech Tomas Berdych stunned second seed Andy Roddick 6-7 7-5 7-6 to reach to the final of the <strong>Japan Open</strong>. The ninth seed will face a player who has won 29 of his previous 30 matches in today's final in Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro. Fifth seed Del Potro beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-3 4-6 7-5 in the first semi-final at the Tokyo tournament.</p> <p>Roddick, one of several players still chasing a spot in the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, took the first set on a tiebreak after slamming a 10th ace past Berdych. The Czech struck back in the second, breaking Roddick's serve in the 11th game and then restored parity by forcing the American into a wild forehand.</p> <p>Roddick jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the decider, but the former US Open champion faltered while serving for the match at 5-3 and was made to pay. Berdych pushed the set to another tiebreak and the Czech quickly raced to a 6-1 advantage, wrapping up proceedings on his third match point with his 17th ace.</p>",
  "<h2>Libra</h2> <p><strong>23 September - 23 October</strong></p> <p>Communication breakdown is the week's potential theme. So double-check dates, drag paperwork along to meetings and revise that party list. Mercury poses problems, but brings vibrant encounters and offers, with money and travel highlighted. Until the 15th, things won't be what they seem. Be at your ambiguous best.</p> <p>\u2022 Ricky Hatton, 6 October 1978</p> <h2>Scorpio</h2> <p><strong>24 October - 21 November</strong></p> <p>Mars may be 'Bringer of War', as Gustav Holst put it, but the march of the red planet through Scorpio's skies makes the next six weeks a favourable time in which to relaunch your brand and push your luck. This week, however, Venus is your lodestone, highlighting your ability to attract allies, favours and lovers. Old faces that are popping out of the woodwork may have to wait in the queue.</p> <h2>Aquarius</h2> <p><strong>20 January - 19 February</strong></p> <p>Patience and persistence are major allies now - the world may be on go-slow but social and professional connections remain fortuitous, especially international ones. Initiatives that seem a dead end can pay you back in the weeks ahead. </p> <h2>Pisces</h2> <p><strong>20 February - 20 March</strong></p> <p>Since the powers-that-be still look in sullen mood, seek help and satisfaction from overseas clients and friends, or dashing types who don't toe the official line. You're not one to be shoehorned into conformity. Next weekend's Piscean Moon puts you in the limelight: sing, dance or sail away.</p> <h2>Gemini</h2> <p><strong>21 May - 20 June </strong></p> <p>Uh oh. The meeting of your planet, Mercury, and the Sun is often the cue for the communications network to go belly up - check your schedules and don't leave belongings on the train/plane. Your mission remains well starred over the next fortnight, especially for resolving issues involving children (not necessarily your own). Set the prize in your sights - it's a fine time to get your own way!</p> <h2>Cancer</h2> <p><strong>21 June - 22 July</strong></p> <p>It's a paradoxical interlude, as if a new phase is bursting to begin but being held back. After next week's full Moon, the gates of opportunity swing open, but your social and romantic life already has a serendipitous touch (birthdays circa 11 July take note), suggesting that you take yourself out of the house. That applies doubly on Saturday - just make sure you have the party address right. </p> <h2>Sagittarius</h2> <p><strong>22 November - 21 December</strong></p> <p>Being pushed out of your professional comfort zone remains one of autumn's major themes, but current planetary tides favour a re-calibration of working methods as you march on. A shrewd edit of colleagues and friendships is likewise in the mix, though new acquaintances promise to become more than casual acquaintances. That includes those arriving this weekend - the Moon is still in your skies today. </p> <h2>Capricorn</h2> <p><strong>22 December - 19 January</strong></p> <p>Struggles at work lose their mean edge now that Mars has moved on, leaving you space to refine tactics, keep an eye on practical affairs and stop valuable correspondence finding its way into someone's bin. Congenial relations with colleagues and friends are the other order of the week, not least on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the Moon and Jupiter meet in your skies. Any grand gestures up your sleeve?</p> <h2>Aries</h2> <p><strong>21 March -19 April</strong></p> <p>With a Mercury maelstrom opposing your sign, it's either your words coming back to haunt you or someone on whom you were relying flaking out. Avoid making or accepting firm commitments until the 15th - there's more information on the way. The shift of your planet, Mars, signals less pressure and makes private (maybe very private) passions the ones to pursue...</p> <h2>Taurus</h2> <p><strong>20 April - 20 May</strong></p> <p>If you're in the dating game, the next fortnight is prime time for temptation and adventure, while those in partnerships can recommit or bury the hatchet. If you still feel unappreciated, cast your energies into work - given this week's tricky planets, there should be plenty to sort out. A rescue operation would fit the bill nicely. </p> <h2>Leo</h2> <p><strong>23 July - 22 August</strong></p> <p>Staying ambiguous and refusing to commit to a course of action may drive others mad (especially you know who), but until next week's full Moon clears the air, everything is a work in progress. Swagger on. If there's one area that calls for resolve, it's your home, where peace and beauty should reign... unless, that is, you're getting in the decorators or kicking out a flatmate.</p> <h2>Virgo</h2> <p><strong>23 August - 22 September</strong></p> <p>Practical affairs may only be able to proceed at half speed, but chip away - the pace of change ups dramatically in the weeks ahead. Your personal life is where the short-term action is most promising. Friendships, and the ambiguous line where they become something more, dominate your 'scope - a cue to hang out, show off, and make your move.</p>",

  "<p>There is glee on Kia Joorabchian's face as he hurtles across his box on the halfway line at the Emirates Stadium to celebrate Robin van Persie's opening goal. 'Now, that is football,' Joorabchian informs one of his international guests as Arsenal ease ahead of Porto and set off on a Champions League cruise.</p> <p>Joorabchian has supported Arsenal since his childhood years as an escapee from Iran's Islamic Revolution. As his business career meandered through market-floor oil trading, US-based hedge funds, UK car sales, London health centres and a Middle Eastern 'distress fund', he once explored the idea of buying into the club before deciding he could afford a \u00a3100,000-a-year corporate box, but not the whole shebang.</p> <p>Instead, Joorabchian found another way into football. He became the lightning-rod front man of an otherwise secretive buy-in to Brazilian club Corinthians, which brought unprecedented transfer spending and a league title but ended in a federal police investigation, court actions, frozen bank accounts and relegation. Joorabchian has denied any wrongdoing throughout and an arrest warrant issued against him in Brazil has been suspended. He led an ultimately rejected takeover bid for West Ham. And he established himself as one of football's more important fixers - albeit taking a central role in one of the English game's great controversies en route.</p> <p>When Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez left Corinthians for West Ham after performing well for Argentina at the 2006 World Cup finals, it was to general astonishment. Here were two of South America's most accomplished young footballers signing for a relatively minor club who had just finished ninth in their first season back in the Premier League.</p> <p>If the deal appeared too good to be true, it was. Soon it emerged that West Ham had not purchased the Argentines, but borrowed them with no control over their next move. The sellers were not Corinthians, but four investment funds - Media Sports Investments (MSI), Just Sports Incorporated, Global Soccer Agencies (GSA) and Mystere Services Limited - represented by Joorabchian.</p> <p>Worse still, West Ham broke the Premier League's rules by hiding the third-party ownership of the players' 'economic rights'. When the barely used Mascherano left for Liverpool the following January, the League was informed of the transgression, sparking a process of tribunal and litigation that is still unresolved. West Ham were told to tear up their contract with Tevez and his owners, yet, according to the independent tribunal, secretly promised to honour it. The tribunal fined them \u00a35.5m for rule breaches in April 2007, but did not deduct points from the relegation-threatened club. Sheffield United went down and, like Joorabchian, took High Court action against West Ham for breach of contract. As the legal arguments unfolded, West Ham agreed to an independent arbitration process, which last month decreed that a points penalty should have been imposed and the Blades were entitled to an as yet undecided sum of compensation. Throw in their legal fees, and a pair of South Americans who arrived for next to nothing may ultimately cost West Ham as much as \u00a350m.</p> <p>There are those associated with West Ham who say they will never forgive Joorabchian for the problems he has caused their club, despite the fact that the tribunal's findings were against the club and not against Joorabchian, who believes he did nothing wrong.</p> <p>'The question is, why are we responsible for those deals?' he asks. 'Why are we responsible for what happened to West Ham? And no one can answer that, because what we did was perfectly within the regulations of the Premier League. We brought in two loan players, we made a contract with West Ham United to loan them out. If West Ham do not register that contract with the Premier League it is out of our hands. I am not responsible to register the contract with West Ham with the Premier League, I am not responsible to register the contract of Carlos at Man United with the Premier League. That's to do with the club and the people inside it. We're making a deal. I made sure that on my side the contract - the release of the player, the registration - everything is legal. They have to make sure on the football side everything is legal.</p> <p>'Believe me, if we had done anything wrong we also would have been under the lawsuit, under scrutiny. But clearly since we have never been sued, never been accused of any wrongdoing, everyone has granted that we hadn't done anything wrong. And, quite contrary, everyone knows that third-party ownership was permitted because Liverpool and Man United both managed to do it after [the West Ham deal].'</p> <p>On that he is half right. Though the Premier League permitted Mascherano and Tevez to move north on loan deals that left their economic rights in the hands of the funds Joorabchian manages, the League ensured their contracts specified fixed periods in which the players could not be sold and at the end of which Liverpool and United had first option to buy at a predetermined price.</p> <p>While League officials say that West Ham would have been allowed to structure their Mascherano and Tevez loans in such fashion had they declared Joorabchian's involvement from the off, they have since introduced rules that outlaw transfers of that type. When, for example, Manchester City sought to sign J\u00f4 this summer they were required to buy the Brazilian striker 100 per cent. No loan deal, even of the Man United-Tevez formulation, was allowed.</p> <p>The principle, say the Premier League, is 'to stop third-party ownership at these shores'. Their worry was having no regulatory control over the individuals or companies that owned such players; that they could do little to stop a third-party owner from instructing one of his goalkeepers to allow a forward from the same stable to score against him to increase the latter's market value.</p> <p>Joorabchian's response to the new rule is interesting. He accepts that third-party ownership could be problematic in countries such as England where some clubs are owned by billionaires. 'I'm not saying there is a potential for bad behaviour, but there is a potential that someone can say it's unfair,' he says. 'They [the Premier League] said this system doesn't work in England - fair enough - so we stopped doing that.' But only in England. Joorabchian still manages a company, Sports Invest, that purchases the economic rights of talented footballers, loans them to clubs and waits for the player's market value to rise before selling on the rights for a profit.</p> <p>'It is the South American model and a model that appears all over Europe,' he explains. 'We'll invest in a player and loan him to the club. Then if the club thinks that that player is amazing they can buy him from us. If the club wants to buy the player prior to us buying him, that's OK, too, but a lot of clubs don't want to take the risk. So we invest the money and let the club borrow the player. Of course the club pay only a loan fee but we get the upside if the player is successful. And if the player is unsuccessful we get the downside. We still have a business in South America and across Europe, and the business is very profitable.'</p> <p>It is indeed commonplace in Europe and within the rules - at least two of the Porto side at Arsenal arrived in Portugal on transfers part-funded by GSA. </p> <p>When the FA recently circulated a register of unlicensed agents, instructing clubs not to use the blacklisted individuals in transfer deals, questions were asked as to why Joorabchian's name did not appear on it. The FA explain that is because Joorabchian does not engage in agent activity - essentially that he does not formally sign off on transfer deals.</p> <p>'I'm not a football agent and I don't practise as an agent. I think the agency business is very different,' Joorabchian says. 'We also have a business that advises players on their rights. We advise them on their image, on their financial stability, we advise them on every aspect, because a lot of agents are not professional to do that. A lot of agents work for us and basically they just do the player transfer. We provide the structure, and for that they work for us.'</p> <p>His company also advises clubs on transfers and player contracts, puts them in contact with agents and even offers to scout for them. Joorabchian will not reveal the number of Premier League teams he works with, nor the agents he operates with, for fear of 'losing my competitive edge', but admits to dealing on an informal basis with Manchester City and to having one formal consultancy agreement - with West Ham United.</p> <p>'We provide them with a manner of how to get a player,' Joorabchian says. 'If they don't know which agent to contact to get X player, we will resource that for them, connect the agent to them. If they want information on players in South America we can provide it. We have a full scouting service, we provide them with a structure. We are another arm of the football director. We've been involved in advising them on what offers to accept and what not. And we've been paid according to how we've agreed with them, but I can't disclose how we've been paid. It's all within the context of our consultancy agreement.'</p> <p>If the concept of West Ham's new owners employing a man so central to their current travails as an adviser appears bizarre, it may be because it was agreed as an out-of-court settlement to Joorabchian's High Court action against the club for tearing up the contract agreed over Tevez and then charging him to move the player to Manchester United. 'We'd given them a free loan and they wanted to charge us \u00a32m, which was unfair,' Joorabchian says. 'So we processed and settled to get our money back. Not to gain any money, but to get our money back.'</p> <p>Whose money, exactly, Joorabchian will not say. The exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky is one businessman whose name has been linked to MSI, though he denies any involvement. Players' agent Pini Zahavi has admitted to advising GSA but denied being an investor. The structure of Joorabchian's company is designed to keep investors' identities concealed. So restrictive are his confidentiality agreements, Joorabchian cannot even say if he is an investor himself. </p> <p>'I can't reveal any shareholder,' he says. 'It's under my obligation. What I can tell you is that I manage the investment group, I don't work with MSI, I have no connection with MSI, I resigned from that in 2006, so that's that. But I manage the investment group and obviously when the investment group is profitable, as fund manager, you also get a cut.'</p> <p>From his plush seats at Arsenal that cut appears to be a good one. The Premier League do not like him, but Kia Joorabchian has no intention of exiting football any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Tough on crime or tough on the causes of crime? The banks are, rightly, in the firing line for the irresponsible behaviour that triggered the crash. But the centre of the Anglo-American financial system, round which everything else revolves, including banks, is the stock market.</p> <p>The stock market's importance is not just instrumental, in that it provides the corporate chips that investors trade. It also functions, in theory at least, as capitalism's central institution of corporate governance, both disciplining managers and ensuring that the economy's resources are efficiently allocated. </p> <p>Companies raise money through the stock market for profitable ventures; shareholders use it to transfer finance from less efficient companies to more efficient ones; and, by providing a market for corporate control, it ensures that better managers squeeze out worse ones (by buying up their companies) and that shareholders can compel managers to run the company in their interests rather than using their inside knowledge to line their own pockets.</p> <p>So much for the theory. Yet, as two interesting new academic papers point out, the credit crunch casts the pivotal role of the stock market in a rather less flattering light. For a start, notes Royal Holloway's Brendan McSweeney in a paper entitled 'Hubris, Nemesis and Financial Markets', successive asset bubbles leave the capital markets' claim to rational behaviour looking shaky at best. But even ignoring that, the boast that the stock market effectively allocates scarce investment resources is undercut by the fact that it barely provides any. </p> <p>Between 1970 and 1994, US and UK companies met all their finance needs from internal sources (retained profits and capital allowances) and bank borrowing. Net new share issues were negative. And these figures overstate the allocation case; as McSweeney notes, few companies issue shares to finance new investment projects. Rather they are to provide an exit for investors (via IPOs), take over another firm, or pay off loans.</p> <p>If the stock market isn't allocating resources, what is it doing instead? Look again at the negative share of stock issues in corporate funding. Analysis by economist William Lazonick ('The Quest for Shareholder Value: Stock Repurchases in the US Economy') shows that US companies (faithfully copied, as usual, by the UK) are increasingly using share buybacks rather than dividends to reward shareholders. The figures are staggering. Lazonick calculates that between 2003 and 2007 the S&amp;P 500 companies repurchased no less than $1.7 trillion worth of their own shares. In 2007 alone, buybacks totalled $597bn, representing 90 per cent of net income.</p> <p>Why are managers spending so much money on liquidating their own shares rather than on, say, R&amp;D for whizzy new products? </p> <p>The official answer is that they are doing shareholders' bidding, returning to them 'free cash flow' left over after all profitable investment opportunities have been exploited. Unofficially, suggests Lazonick, their vast stash of stock options gives them an irresistible incentive to do buybacks to boost share prices even if they undermine long-term value.</p> <p>Just how much value they undermine has been brought into focus by the credit crunch. Which sector spent most on buybacks last year? Yep, financials - the same companies that are now cap in hand for cash injections from almost any source. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent $10bn on their own stock in the three years to 2007, Bear Stearns $6bn. Citigroup, which gratefully accepted an equity injection of $7.5bn from Abu Dhabi, spent more than that on buybacks in 2006-7. Merrill Lynch bought back $14bn of shares in the same period, bankrupt Lehman $5bn.</p> <p>In other words, 'free cash flow' is about as free as 'free lunch'. It's not free for the 850 R&amp;D scientists GlaxoSmithkline announced it was making redundant last week, as part of plans to save \u00a3700m by 2010 - a sum dwarfed by the \u00a312bn two-year share buyback programme launched last year. This is a microcosm of the 'downsize-and-distribute' (to shareholders) model of allocation, the consequences of which Observer business editor Ruth Sunderland described in her column last week: huge rewards for the few; downsizing, outsourcing, loss of pension and job security for the many, all in the name of the implacable efficiency of the capital markets.</p> <p>It's nothing to do with economic efficiency. As the receding tide of credit pulls out the foundations of one self-weakened company after another, a different truth is left behind in the wreckage. Far from an impartial governance institution, today's stock market has been hijacked by a tiny officer class of top executives of large corporations and bankers, whose interests it reflects and reinforces. It's a casino - but what other gaming house allows players to draw up the rules of the game, rig the odds in their favour and disown their losses?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A tug-of-war over the tragic story of a 14-year-old Spanish girl who died of cancer has caused a confrontation between a film-maker and one of Spain's most controversial and powerful religious groups, Opus Dei.</p> <p>The battle over Alexia Gonz\u00e1lez-Barros, a Catholic whom campaigners want the Vatican to beatify, is the result of the impending release of The Path, in which director Javier Fesser shows the protagonist's death being applauded by her Opus Dei family.</p> <p>The film places the dying girl at the centre of a web of interests in which Opus Dei grooms her for a death that will turn her into both a potential saint and a tool for propaganda.</p> <p>The real-life Alexia died in 1985 after four operations and a 10-month fight against cancer. Nine biographies have been written since her death. The beatification campaign started in 1989 and the petition, containing 4,600 pages in 11 volumes of documents, is now being considered by the Vatican.</p> <p>Fesser has dedicated the film to Alexia's memory, but says she served only as an inspiration for the protagonist, whom he calls Camino. 'It is not, nor does it pretend to be, Alexia,' he said. 'It is pure fiction.' He has angered Alexia's family, however, by claiming that they really did applaud her death. </p> <p>Opus Dei, a secular order of priests and laymen aiming to bring religion into the workplace and professions, also criticised the way it has been depicted in a film whose title comes from a book written by its founder, Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1 de Balaguer. 'It is a false and manipulative picture which offers a highly distorted view of Opus Dei,' said the group's Spanish spokesman, Manuel Garrido.</p> <p>Alexia's family and her beatification campaigners have led the charge against the film, claiming that she is 'unequivocally the main protagonist'. Her brother Alfredo said in a letter on the campaign's website: 'Your claim that the applause that greeted the protagonist's death really happened when Alexia died hurts because it is both unjust and terrible. She died as we tried to swallow our tears.'</p> <p>Critics describe the film as a devastating critique of Opus Dei. 'A child who is full of life is used, not just by the sect's leaders, but by her own blinkered mother and a robotic sister, as a sacrificial lamb to glorify both death and the will of God,' said Carlos Boyero in El Pa\u00eds newspaper.</p> <p>Fesser said: 'Nothing that is shown in the film should disgust Opus Dei, and if something does it will not be the film's fault.'</p> <p>The row comes amid a wider confrontation in Spain between an increasingly politicised Catholic leadership and those who want the church separated completely from the state. Senior bishops have helped lead right-wing opposition to several laws passed by Socialist Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, including those allowing gay marriage or reducing the importance of religious education in school. Campaigners on the left, meanwhile, are calling for an end to the many state subsidies received by the church. With reform of the abortion law now possible, the confrontation is likely to continue for some time.</p>",

And if you're a silly young girlie who gets into trouble, then forget it.'</p> <p>There's a particular silly young girlie Clare is referring to: Michelle Palmer, a 36-year-old advertising executive who in July this year was arrested for allegedly having sex on a beach with Vince Acors, a 34-year-old visiting company director from Kent. </p> <p>It's been a tabloid sensation. Palmer's 'Bridget Jones' lifestyle endlessly examined; at least a dozen conflicting versions of the story printed - they did have sex, they didn't have sex, Palmer may or may not have waved her shoe and called the policeman 'a fucking Muslim' - the case comes to court this week and the prosecution is said to have concrete DNA evidence to prove they didn't have sex, but beyond that, almost nothing is certain other than the fact that, if convicted, they both face up to six years in jail.</p> <p>And whatever the verdict, Palmer has already lost her job - with the publishers ITP which produces Time Out Dubai and whose chairman is Andrew Neil; but then there's no such thing as unfair dismissal in the United Arab Emirates - and been mauled in the press. The Daily Mail is in strict accordance with sharia law on this point: it's the woman's shame. </p> <p>In Dubai, it's shocked the local population and split the expat community between those who feel sympathy and those who think she deserves nothing less than a stoning. </p> <p>'What I can't believe,' says Clare, 'is the amount of venom directed towards her. The reaction here has been unbelievable. I think people are under such pressure. They know it's not the dream. And they need a scapegoat. The fact is that if you can ascribe blame to someone else's misfortune, then you are indemnifying yourself against it happening to you.'</p> <p>There are a lot of Brits in Dubai. A lot of people that it, or something similar, could have happened to. People who don't much want to contemplate how the judicial system works (at best haphazardly, at worst unequally), or how long you can be detained without trial (months at a time) or what the British embassy will do to help you (not a lot). In the past year, 230 Britons have found themselves imprisoned for offences ranging from driving under the influence to bouncing a cheque.</p> <p>It's a minimum four-year term if any trace of drugs is found on you: the Radio One DJ Grooverider, caught with 2.16g of cannabis, spent 10 months inside before being pardoned two weeks ago, and Cat Le-Huy, a producer with Endemol, spent three weeks in jail without being charged, for possession of Melatonin - jetlag pills.</p> <p>The Palmer-Acors case is about much more than any of this, though. It's exposed the very contradiction that has made modern Dubai what it is: a tolerant haven in an intolerant region. And it's the tension between the two Dubais: the socially conservative society whose penal code is based on sharia; and the other Dubai, the increasingly visible Dubai, whose numbers are growing with every fresh planeload of people who land at the airport and wear crop tops to the mall and drink shooters in the bars. </p> <p>It's to Dubai's enormous credit that these two halves have so far been accommodated side by side, but the strain has started to tell. When I visited last week, it was Ramadan and the restrictions in Dubai are far harsher than in any other Arab country I've visited. Eating and drinking during daylight hours is illegal; even for non-Muslims, having a sip of water can mean a jail sentence. I got the timing of my trip all wrong. I'd wanted to check out the Friday 'brunch' scene, all-day boozeathons which provided the setting for the Palmer-Acors romance, and I email the editor of an English language newspaper in a panic. </p> <p>'Don't worry,' he emails back. 'You'll see plenty.' And it's true: I can't drink coffee at the Starbucks next to my hotel, food is only served in a curtained-off enclave, and the clubs are closed - a DJ called Michael Robert describes the usual scene as 'like Ibiza but minus the drugs, the fights and the aggro'. But after 7.30pm, all across the city, in any number of bars, it's like downtown Croydon at closing time on a Friday night. </p> <p>At Long's Bar, it's a crush of short skirts and spaghetti straps - alcohol is illegal if you're a local, and practically a social obligation if you're not. And afterwards, a local journalist takes me on a tour of 'the dark side', taking in a hooker bar in a four-star chain hotel. Prostitution is illegal, but absolutely blatant - every shape, size, nationality, ethnicity and possible aesthetic taste catered for. </p> <p>But then, somehow Dubai manages to be all things to all people. It's capitalism's ultimate expression: the land of opportunity, the most developed city in the Middle East, a free port. It's ruled absolutely by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and is a constituent part of the UAE, a federation of seven emirates, including, down the road, immensely oil-rich Abu Dhabi, whose ruling family has just bought Manchester City. Dubai, on the other hand, never had much oil; it's been forced to develop in other ways, to provide whatever is needed, and it's done so more quickly and successfully than anyone could anticipate. It knows what the rest of the world wants and has built it before anyone else has even realised.</p> <p>Alexander McNabb, a PR executive and the writer of a blog called Fake Plastic Souks, arrived 15 years ago, when 'it was still a village, a strange and very foreign place'. It was the entrep\u00f4t of the Gulf and its R'n'R facility, where oilmen came to relax - they knew the rules and relished the freedom. It's this that's changed. There are now 100,000 Brits living and working in Dubai. And last year 1.1m UK tourists visited - despite summer temperatures of 50C plus, it's now the second most popular long-haul destination after Florida. And the ways in which the city is changing are in many ways a reflection of Britain itself.</p> <p>Now, says McNabb, 'you drive your western car to your western office. At the weekends you go to the western hotels and have your western buffets and western-style beach club, and it's quite easy to ignore the fact that you're abroad.'</p> <p>He's right. It is easy. It's four days before I hear any actual Arabic. Most remarkably of all the remarkable things about Dubai is that it's occupied almost entirely by foreigners: native Emiratis make up barely 20 per cent of the population. They're a minority in their own country. </p> <p>When I meet Sultan Al-Qassemi, a businessman and journalist, he points out that the Emiratis are handling this rather better than the British would. 'Can you imagine? It's the equivalent of there being 55m foreigners in Britain, and just 5m of you. It's a unique case, and I think we deserve extra credit for the way we are handling it. The country is completely open. It is a utopia! Anyone can come here! We are one of the most tolerant countries in the world. And all this has happened in a single generation. Thirty years ago, it was desert.'</p> <p>He sends me down the road, to the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding and I arrive in time for iftar - the breaking of the fast. There's a group of expats and we're given dates and water, and then platters of home-cooked food are brought while young Emiratis tell us about their culture. It's fascinating: they're so friendly, and articulate and welcoming. 'It's so difficult to meet Emiratis, to talk to them. In a year, I haven't properly met one,' a British woman named Paula tells me. </p> <p>Khulooda, a bright and sparky 21-year-old in a fringed abaya, tells me she's studying marketing and tourism. She thinks people maybe need to do a little more research about the country before they arrive. That maybe people should wear more appropriate clothing when they go to the mall. That Palmer and Acors should have known better. I think maybe she's right. And I hope, for her sake, that she goes into some other industry instead. </p> <p>A decade ago, who had even heard of going on holiday in Dubai? But what Dubai has proved is that if you build it, they will come. For if there's one thing Dubai can do, it's build: one third of the world's cranes are here at any one time, most of them directly outside of my hotel window. I try and count them but give up at 70. The highest is perched a kilometre up in the air, on the top of the Burj Dubai, already the tallest building in the world, and it's not yet finished. Next month, the biggest shopping mall in the world will open, the Dubai Mall, and shortly you'll be able to fly into the world's biggest airport - six runways and the size of Hong Kong island. What's more, if you stay in your hotel, you need never even know you're in an autocratic Islamic state where it's illegal to hold your wife's hand in public, or be gay, or found with 0.003g of cannabis - less than a grain of sugar - on the sole of your shoe, as Keith Brown was, a youth worker from the West Midlands who was sentenced to four years in jail. </p> <p>But the hotels are wonderful. And even the Observer's modest budget runs to a five-star number. I'm on the 35th floor, with vertiginous views down, vertiginous views up. It's slightly queasy-making, more so after I talk to Chris Davidson, a Gulf political expert based at Durham University. </p> <p>Two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE, he tells me. And every weekday, the malls are full of able-bodied young men simply hanging out. 'They're the first generation who've had this cradle-to-grave security, who receive a house from the government and money to get married, who've not known hardship or what it is not to have air conditioning. How are they reacting to what they see happening to their country? And if something did happen here, tourism would collapse overnight. Real estate would collapse. Dubai is so fragile. It's the result of a global boom and it's never properly been put to the test.'</p> <p>Economically, nobody's sure how it will weather the global crisis. The region is awash with ever-increasing petrodollars, but Dubai's construction projects are highly leveraged. And culturally, tourism is Dubai's great unmentionable can of worms, its fault line. A blogger, who'll only identify herself as Secret Dubai, tells me Dubai's marketing machine has deliberately created 'the false sense of westernness, of a trashy holiday resort'. And, according to Davidson, it's reached 'a critical mass. Previously people were corralled into five-star enclaves; what the Palmer-Acors case shows is that they're starting to leak out.'</p> <p>The week I visit, Atlantis opens - a mega resort owned by Sol Kerzner, the South African who gave the world Sun City. It's a vast pink edifice that looks like something Katie Price might design, built on an artificial island shaped like a palm tree. </p> <p>It's actually only one of three palms under construction, which together will add 520km of beaches to Dubai's coastline, and where the Beckhams are alleged to have 'bought' a villa, along with Rio Ferdinand and Michael Owen. It's all PR, but then nowhere in the world wants the Beckhams to love it as much as Dubai. It's more of a WAG than almost any other place on earth: flashy, artificially enhanced, desperate to please, all things to all people.</p> <p>I tour the resort and dutifully write down the stats: $1.5bn to build,1,539 rooms, a Nobu and a Locatelli restaurant, a $25,000-a-night suite, 65,000 marine animals, a 1.4km beach.</p> <p>Do you think most tourists even know it's Ramadan, I ask.</p> <p>'That's a good question,' says the PR, a South African. 'I think they receive information at the airport.'</p> <p>Actually, they don't, I say. We ponder this for a moment, and then she tells me about what a wonderful life she's had since she moved there.</p> <p>Back in the Meadows, Clare invites me to an expat ladies' coffee morning. It's not an obvious place to go and meet a hotbed of radical malcontents. The lawns are neat, the communal pool still inviting. And yet... Nobody's managing to save. Rents are sky high: \u00a345,000 a year for a modest villa, paid in advance. And you can't move jobs: your visa is sponsored by your employer. </p> <p>Jane says: 'If I knew now what I knew then, I just wouldn't have come.' She's spent months and months trying to get her daughter with mild ADHD into any sort of school. Laura bought a house, in a 'lovely, quiet, very green development' and the road in front of it has just been torn up to build a six-lane highway. And Rebecca, who's lived in Dubai for 13 years, tells story after story of the Dubai-dream-gone-wrong. </p> <p>'People just don't know what they're getting themselves into,' she says. 'There's no social infrastructure, no safety net, nothing.' You don't even have to do anything wrong; a bad case of bad luck is enough. She puts me in touch with Richard, a twinkly fortysomething who came to Dubai as a salesman with a multinational company. 'And then, in one month, I had a car accident, lost my job, and my marriage fell apart.'</p> <p>Richard fell behind on his car payments, his bank loans, his credit cards. 'Everybody lives beyond their means here. It's all front. It's like Dubai - a totally false appearance to what it actually is.' He was charged by the police with defaulting on his loans and his passport was confiscated. 'So I couldn't get another job and I couldn't pay the debt, and I couldn't leave the country... and to cut a very long story short, I got 12 months.'</p> <p>It's quite a story. He's only been out two weeks, but he's still managing just about to smile. But not even the judges are Emiratis: they're on short-stay visas like everyone else, and the only thing he had going in his favour, he says, is that he wasn't Asian. 'Tons of them are in for practically nothing: jaywalking or owing \u00a310.'</p> <p>All over Dubai you see construction workers outside in the searing heat. They're the ones building Dubai - they live in what are openly called 'labour camps', have very often paid hundreds of dollars to an agency for a visa and are trapped for years until they've paid off the debt. The 7,500 workers on the Burj Dubai are paid $7.50 a day; unskilled ones $4. It's how globalisation works, of course. We get to buy our cheap Primark tops because in a factory far, far away somebody isn't paid very much to make them. But in Dubai, you see it every time you step outside.</p> <p>Nick McGeehan, founder of an organisation called Mafiwasta, tells me it's more than that. 'The difference is that the salaries paid in sweatshops in foreign countries reflect the economic weakness of that country. Furthermore, the people who work in them go home to their families at night.'</p> <p>He was an oil contractor but was so appalled at the plight of these workers that he set up Mafiwasta and is attempting to make a legal case that the UAE government is complicit in these workers' enslavement. He forwards an email to me he's recently received from an Indian recruitment agent. She's trying to help 133 men she sent to Dubai to fulfil a contract who haven't been paid, whose passports have been confiscated, who are not just living in inhumane, insanitary conditions but had been denied even basic necessities such as drinking water.</p> <p>'It's very unusual for an agent to come forward, and even more so to have one who actually cares about what happens to the workers,' says McGeehan. The only recourse, he tells her, is to get it in the newspapers... </p> <p>Both Secret Dubai and Chris Davidson have fallen foul of the UAE's censorship laws. The Secret Dubai blog, winner of a Webby award, is blocked - along with My Space, Flickr and Friends Reunited - and Davidson's recently published book Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success was, like Harry Potter, banned, although the ban has now been lifted.</p> <p>Mostly though, the authorities rely on editors to self-censor - an even more effective weapon. 'I defy a journalist who has been here a few months, who has got their child into a school, to rock the boat,' says Davidson. I interview a high-profile Emirati academic, and later he rings me up and says: 'You're not going to write anything... critical, are you? Our culture is different from yours, you see. But I didn't say anything negative, did I?'</p> <p>He points me, as several others do, toward Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at Emirates university, and possibly the most outspoken person in the country. 'He says really quite remarkable things,' the other academic tells me. 'And he gets away with it. It's very surprising.'</p> <p>Maybe he's fearless. Or maybe it is, as he says, that others need to be braver. 'We have to have more accountability of the government, more criticism of the policies. More talk about our future and where we are going. Dubai is an amazing place. We are so much further ahead than the rest of the Middle East, but we can't be first on social indicators and last on political ones... It's an embarrassment.'</p> <p>Even more than that, he says, the place needs to take a long, hard look at itself. Because in 2015, he estimates, Emiratis will make up 10 per cent of the population. And in 2025, at the same rate of growth, zero per cent. 'At the moment when we have everything, we're in danger of losing it all - our very identity.'</p> <p>I don't go out of my way to track Palmer and Acors down. The case is being heard this week so it's a particularly sensitive time for them. And anyway, they're not really the story. They were drunk and foolish and they might pay an exceedingly high price for their actions, but more than anything else they're simply fallout from an ideological schism that is not of their making.</p> <p>I don't look for them, but almost everyone I meet is acquainted with one or both of them. Palmer has been in hiding for the past two months, reportedly suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. And Acors? He's there in Long's Bar when I visit. In fact, he's not just in the same bar, he's standing drinking with the same group of friends.</p> <p>I'm all set to question him, but his friends take me aside: 'He's just an ordinary bloke. He won't talk to you. Just leave him alone.' So I do. It's true, he's just an ordinary bloke. In an extraordinary place. At precisely the wrong moment in time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008.

  "<h2>Jacqui Smith exposed in bondage sensation</h2> <p>Here is something for the Home Secretary to look forward to as she returns to Westminster after the summer recess. A not entirely family friendly group campaigning against the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which comes into force in the new year, is stepping up its campaign and Jacqui Smith is to be its primary target. The campaigners' argument is with the part of the bill that will make it illegal to possess 'extreme pornographic images'. This amounts, they claim, to censorship.</p> <p>Leading the charge is artist Ben Westwood, son of fashion designer Dame Vivienne, who says: 'It's a breach of human rights.'</p> <p>This column has learnt of a plan by Westwood and his friends to project a large image of Jacqui Smith, gagged and tied to a chair, on to the Houses of Parliament. It is, perhaps, important to point out that this is a composite artwork put together by Westwood, not a genuine picture of the Home Secretary. 'It's slightly silly,' admits my source. 'But it also makes an important point about Smith's attempts to gag artists and members of the fetish community.'</p> <p>The exact date of the proposed stunt is a secret in case anyone tries to interfere, but I understand it will take place towards the end of November.</p> <p>Other opponents of the bill include the rather more strait-laced campaigning organisation Liberty, 40 serious academics who question the research behind the bill which suggests viewing such images can affect behaviour, and - pleasingly - the International Union of Sex Workers. </p> <p>It's quite a coalition even for the tough Smith to take on and perhaps it is just as well that she can enjoy the support of the rather more experienced Justice Secretary Jack Straw, who shares responsibility for the legislation.</p> <h2>Daryl Hannah's vegan cred gets booted into touch</h2> <p>Animal rights activists are nothing if not consistent. It was surprising, therefore, to see vegan actress Daryl Hannah, a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wearing suede boots to Richard Branson's party last week. 'They were my mum's,' she explained. 'I only wear leather when it's a gift.' </p> <p>She's over here to film a movie called Blind Man's Bluff, based on Gilbert Adair's novel A Closed Book, which tells the story of a Booker Prize-winning writer who goes blind following a car crash. Hannah said, after some thought about just what his name was, that it will star Tom Conti and be shot at Knebworth. </p> <p>As befits a talented actress, Hannah has a healthy understanding of the importance of her work. Reflecting on the 1982 film Blade Runner, which made her famous, she added: 'It has influenced whole generations of people. It is such a part of our culture, a bit like Shakespeare.' Yes, a bit.</p> <h2>If Peston's hearing voices, it'll be Dave </h2> <p>BBC business editor Robert Peston has acquired a number of new fans thanks to the credit crunch. David Cameron is apparently not among them. At the Tory conference, he entertained friends with an impersonation, giving crazy emphasis to random words and pulling his face into a mad grin with lots of stutters.</p> <p>I look forward to their next on-air meeting.</p> <h2>George's jollies</h2> <p>Harry Mount, George Osborne's Bullingdon contemporary, launched his book, A Lust for Window Sills, on Tuesday in Marylebone, where I learned the popular shadow Chancellor belonged also to a second private student society: the Gridiron Club, described by Tatler as 'mind-fryingly dull'.</p> <h2>It's Lazarus ... again</h2> <p>Welcome back Peter Mandelson. Readers may remember I reported that the new Secretary of State for Business had been discussing a peerage during his rapprochement meeting with Gordon Brown in March. It is interesting to note the simultaneous demotion of Gordon's spin doctor Damien McBride. Nicknamed 'McPoison', he does not see eye to eye with Mandy who, friends suggest, finds him 'unsavoury'.</p> <p><strong>Newts for you</strong></p> <p>During the London mayoral election, Boris Johnson was teased for being more at home on Have I Got News for You than with the finer points of his policy brief. So who is to be a guest presenter in the next season of the show? None other than Ken Livingstone.</p> <h2>Buffett's booked</h2> <p>Warren Buffett's authorised biography is on the shortlist for the Financial Times Goldman Sachs business book of the year. Buffett has just bought $5bn of Goldman shares. The book has been serialised in the FT. No one suggests the judges would be swayed by such details.</p> <h2>Glad you asked</h2> <p>At last year's Cancer Research UK 'Turn the Tables' fundraiser, where politicians grill journalists, host Michael Portillo 'forgot' to allow a question from a Pendennis reader to be asked. I am assured it won't happen again. So email your question to be put either by Ken Livingstone to Today's Evan Davis or Tory business spokesman Alan Duncan to Sky's Adam Boulton at lunch on 13 October. A bottle of champagne for the best suggestion.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:pendennis@observer.co.uk\">pendennis@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Kia Sport Pro_cee'd</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a315,595</strong></p> <p><strong>Miles per gallon:</strong> 50.4</p> <p><strong>CO2 per km:</strong> 149 grams </p> <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Speeders</p> <p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Speed readers</p> <p>Over the past years sports fans have grown used to seeing the word Kia emblazoned on the hoardings of dozens of major events. There was, of course, Euro 2008, but there was also the World Cup, the Women's World Cup, the Australian Tennis Open, the Davis Cup and even the Asian X-Games... So it's a surprise to learn that Kia has only just got round to launching its first sports car. It's not a sports car in the two-seat, soft-top, bad-hair, hands-in-the-air way, but it is a sports version of one of its most successful models - the cee'd. Yes that's right, as in seed, with a lower case and a bafflingly redundant apostrophe. A punctuation apocalypse that would have Lynne Truss reaching for her sick bag - or should that be ci'k bag, in Kia speak? </p> <p>In order to tempt the young man in a hurry and on a budget into a Kia, the Korean giant's basic cee'd has been given a little automotive augmentation and been transformed into the pro_cee'd. Yes, Lynne, that is an underscore... Ludicrous name aside, the pro_cee'd doesn't put a wheel wrong.</p> <p>It's a three-door hatch in which everything from the roof to the suspension has been lowered and flattened; even the spotlights have slid round the deep central intake so that they hang just above the ground in front of the wide-set wheel arches. All its windows are shallower, giving the sense that you're sitting in a pillbox rather than a car; my mother-in-law chimed in from the back seat that the 'medieval leper squint in my local church has a better view'. In all, the look is just what Kia wanted - sporty.</p> <p>But in these credit-crunched days, sharp styling, nimble handling, a refreshingly gimmick-free interior, a cracking sound system, low price and a wallet-soothing 2-litre diesel aren't enough to sell a car on their own. And no one is going to take on the social disadvantage of a car that can't even spell its own name. So Kia has done what all big corporations do in such a fix - it's thrown money at the problem. Buy a pro_cee'd and it comes with an unheard-of seven-year full guarantee. The 'bumper to bumper' warranty covers every part of the car for seven years or 100,000 miles, and is transferable to subsequent owners. There's also a 10-year anti-rust warranty. Kia, at least, seems determined to put its money where its mouth is. </p> <p>The car may be South Korean owned, but it was designed in Germany and is built in the firm's Zilina factory in Slovakia. As Kia says: 'Built in Europe for Europeans'. Though considering the fact that Asian-built cars have dominated every road-reliability survey for the past decade, you'd have thought 'Built in South Korea for Europeans' a better bet. </p> <p>Next up for the cee'd (which, if you were wondering, is taken from the now-defunct French abbreviation for European Community, CE, and the car's project name, ED. Genius! These admen are worth their weight in gold, aren't they?) is the ex_cee'd, a soft-top cabriolet, and a model with green credentials, the eco_cee'd. Surely it's just a matter of time until the suck_cee'd arrives.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>A crucial funding meeting chaired by Chancellor Alistair Darling, will next week hear proposals to nationalise the Olympic village.</p> <p>The move would create a \u00a3750m black hole in Olympic finances, putting pressure not just on the \u00a39.35bn budget for 2012, but also on other government departments to make up the shortfall.</p> <p>The ministerial meeting on 15 October will hear funding options from Partnerships UK, the Treasury agency. Other possibilities to be discussed include postponing a funding decision until bank debt becomes cheaper. A decision will be made at the end of the year.</p> <p>Current funding for the \u00a31bn development envisages Australian property giant Lend Lease, which built the Sydney Olympic facilities, committing \u00a3250m of its own money towards the cost with a similar amount coming from government. But Lend Lease has struggled this year to secure the remaining \u00a3500m from banks amid the worsening financial crisis and all the money might now have to come from government - in which eventuality it would take total control of the development.</p> <p>Lend Lease has a legally binding contract to fund the village that, according to Whitehall sources, expires in three months. The Olympic village is hard to finance because after the Games 3,200 homes in east London will go on the market simultaneously. Such a large number could depress property prices, despite a housing shortage in the area.</p> <p>The Olympic financial crisis has not delayed construction of the village. Lend Lease has a separate contract to manage the project and is ahead of schedule. </p> <p>The Treasury is reluctant to make up any shortfall entirely from the \u00a32.7bn Olympic contingency fund. Options include raising money from the Homes and Communities Agency and London Mayor Boris Johnson's housing budget. </p> <p>The Australian property giant, like most companies in the property sector, is facing problems in the wake of the global financial crisis. </p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: 'Given the impact of the global economic downturn in the UK, additional public investment may be needed to help fund the Olympic village.'</p>",
  "<p>Six months after the elections, Zimbabwe still lacks a functioning government and is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe. </p> <p>Following the worst wheat harvest since the independence war, bread has run out and sugar supplies are set to follow. USAid, the American government humanitarian agency, is warning that the country could run out of the maize, the staple food, by next month. Farming officials say the government's stated aim of producing maize on 500,000 hectares this season is unattainable. </p> <p>'We are in serious trouble,' said Jabulani Gwaringa, of the Zimbabwe Farmers' Union (ZFU), which represents small-scale operators. 'There is no seed, fertiliser and crop chemicals on the market. Banks are not offering farmers any credit. In July we had produced about 25,000 metric tons of seed maize. We are down to 9,000 because farmers opted to eat their hybrid seed or sell it to millers.'</p> <p>One European diplomat said: 'We are already hearing isolated reports of child deaths from hunger.' In the poorest provinces, such as Matabeleland North, subsistence farmers have begun bartering their livestock for maize: one cow buys six buckets of maize, while four live chickens or a goat buy one bucket.</p> <p>President Robert Mugabe is still locked in negotiations with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to try to break the deadlock over cabinet posts which is threatening a crucial power-sharing deal. However, the state of the agricultural sector is forming an increasingly alarming backdrop to the talks, which have gone on almost since the disputed elections were held on 29 March.</p> <p>Since Mugabe let his so-called war veterans loose on the mainly white-owned commercial farms in 2000, the government claims to have resettled six million poor blacks on the land. The figure is impossible to verify, but the most obvious outcome has been the collapse of the agriculture sector. In 1998 production of tobacco, flowers, maize and other vegetables yielded 18 per cent of GDP and 45 per cent of foreign currency earnings. Since Mugabe launched his land acquisition offensive, the number of commercial farmers has dwindled from 4,500 to less than 800.</p> <p>While evicted commercial farmers are looking to the future power-sharing government to allow them back onto their properties, the issue is still in the balance. In a little-noticed concession to Zanu-PF, the 15 September agreement underlines the 'irreversibility' of 'the compulsory acquisition and redistribution of land ... since 2000' and agrees that Britain will pay compensation.</p> <p>The MDC has claimed that it accepted the 'irreversibility' clause by insisting on a land audit which will define what belongs to whom. The problem still has not been resolved, raising questions as to whether commercial farmers will return and reinvest in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Trevor Gifford, the Commercial Farmers' Union president, told The Observer that even an international effort over the next six weeks would not be enough to save the coming season. 'It might be possible to raise enough maize seed for 360,000 hectares - which is a third of the maize area that was planted in 2000 - but we will never get enough fertiliser because there is a world shortage and the price has tripled. It is already clear that Zimbabwe will need food aid for the next 18 months at least.'</p> <p>The World Food Programme has been feeding Zimbabweans since 2002 and expects to have to help up to 5.4 million people - out of an estimated total population of 8-9 million - between now and the next harvest in April 2009. USAid's Famine Early Warning Systems Network has said Zimbabwe needs to import more that 700,000 tons of cereals by then.</p> <p>As farmworkers, Joyce, her husband Innocent, and their eight children used to belong to a class of people who knew that, despite earning low wages, they would never starve in southern Africa's breadbasket. They are overlooked for foreign food aid because they live on farms, rather than in villages. But their situation is dire.</p> <p>'We do not have corn every day - only from time to time. For us, even when there are vegetables, if we do not have maize meal it's like we didn't eat at all,' said Innocent. 'We cannot grow anything because the electric motor was stolen in the \"jambanja\" (attack) so we cannot irrigate.'</p> <p>The 'jambanja' happened on 6 May after District Administrator Mike Mariga arrived with a group of armed men to take over their employers' farm. 'They began by beating us,' said Innocent, 'to force us to go and get our employer's gun. When we refused, they threatened to harm our 12-year-old son.' Their white employers - who sustained serious injuries - moved to Harare after the attack. 'They bring us wages and, usually, 50kg of maize meal. But last month they came without maize because they could not find any,' said Innocent, 56.</p> <p>The Tembos' employers are among 77 farmers who have been targeted for attack since they joined an international court action against the government's land acquisition programme. Later this month the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) tribunal in Windhoek, Namibia, is expected to find in the farmers' favour, potentially opening the door to sanctions against Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries. </p> <p>In daily propaganda broadcasts, the government blames international sanctions for all Zimbabwe's woes and trumpets its efforts to help communal farmers by giving them implements, tractors, scotch-carts (trailers), fuel, seed and fertiliser ahead of the rainy season, due to begin next month.</p> <p>'We do not know what we will eat when we have finished the corn you see here. Even if we had seed to plant, what is the point? There would be nothing to eat until February or March next year,' said Innocent.</p> <p>*Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC, which has been attacked for not tackling the subject of the war in Iraq in its drama output, is to announce a hard-hitting new series about the impact of the invasion, starring James Nesbitt.</p> <p>Occupation, by acclaimed screenwriter Peter Bowker, will tell the story of three soldiers who serve in Basra together and will chart their friendship as they face the aftermath of war and join in the effort to rebuild Iraq.</p> <p>In April last year the BBC was criticised for not showing a controversial drama about the deaths of six army Red Caps who had been gunned down in southern Iraq in the summer after the invasion. Kieran Prendiville, creator of hit BBC1 drama Ballykissangel, had written the screenplay in collaboration with the relatives of the dead men. A BBC spokeswoman said the decision had not been taken because of concerns about covering a political issue. However, its termination followed a succession of failed BBC 'war on terror' projects. </p> <p>A planned docu-drama on the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell underground station, and another exploring the lead-up to the 7 July bombings in London, were also dropped, as was a Radio 4 reading from Hanif Kureishi's short story Weddings and Beheadings, written from the viewpoint of a cameraman in Iraq filming the execution of Western hostages.</p> <p>Bowker, best known for writing Blackpool, the BBC drama series with David Tennant and David Morrissey, and Bafta award-winning film Flesh and Blood, starring Christopher Eccleston, has spent four years working on the Occupation project, now being filmed in Belfast and Morocco.</p> <p>Occupation is to go out in three parts next spring after the nine o'clock watershed and will feature the 'unflinching language' of real soldiers. It aims to offer viewers an unsentimental look at what has happened away from the news cameras during the years since the invasion.</p> <p>'We were open-mouthed with disbelief when we heard what went on at a time when the British public were being told that things were getting better,' said producer Derek Wax, of Kudos Films. 'It was just not what Tony Blair was having us believe.'</p> <p>Bowker's screenplay is not a polemic, according to Wax. 'Peter doesn't want to preach to the choir,' he said. 'He doesn't want to talk either about the terrible mistakes made by Tony Blair and George Bush. That has been hammered away at in other films shown elsewhere,' Wax added. </p> <p>Occupation will focus instead on the story of the three central characters and on the surprising dark humour that flourishes even during a violent conflict.</p> <p>Nesbitt is cast as Sgt Mike Swift, who takes part in the first wave of the invasion in April 2003, alongside his two comrades, played by Stephen Graham, recently seen in the film This is England, and Warren Brown, of Channel 4's Hollyoaks</p> <p>'It isn't a message piece in the sense that it can be boiled down to a simple take on the invasion of Iraq and its consequences,' said Bowker. 'It's a story about three men who are united in battle, but are torn apart by the aftermath.'</p> <p>'The fall of Saddam's statue came very quickly and Peter has been more interested in telling the story of the reconstruction attempt. He has done a lot of research and then created a fictional world within that,' said Wax this weekend.</p> <p>'Occupation is an epic journey set over six years. There is a kidnapping and there is also a portrayal of the growing sectarian tensions and the growing fundamentalism in the country.</p> <p>'Peter wanted to give lots of different people a voice in the piece. So there is a lot about the billions of dollars that the place was awash with and the boom time this created for the private contractors. We also have some substantial Iraqi characters in there,' said Wax, who explained that the screenplay had been looked over by the Iraqi Association in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing you noticed was the voice. Deep and casual. 'I'm interested in the movie. I like the ingredients. Come up to the apartment, and let's pick it apart.'</p> <p>When I first met Paul Newman, the physical presence was somewhat diminished. He was shorter and frailer than I expected, and revealed himself later (when I saw him in his shorts jogging up and down the hotel stairs) to have surprisingly skinny legs. The blue eyes were cast down as he opened the door of his apartment. He wore one pair of half-moon spectacles on the end of his nose, another dangling from a cord around his neck. He shuffled about, and made great play of the fact that he was becoming old and forgetful, but I got the sense he was watching me like a hawk. His apartment was jammed with family memorabilia, and photographs which I forced myself not to gawp at. His wife Joanne Woodward was moving about in the kitchen, hair pulled back, serene and very beautiful. </p> <p>We sat down to a home-cooked lunch of roast chicken and salad and he explained his method for cooking the chicken. I remember it involved a lot of salt and it tasted good. I answered his questions about the script as best I could. He had a lot. 'Homburg or trilby or fedora?' 'What's his colour - black or grey or brown?' 'Happily or unhappily married?' Finally he raised his eyes and said, 'You any good at holding people's hands?' 'Yes,' I said. 'Then let's do it.'</p> <p>I left his apartment and walked across the park. Paul Newman just said yes, I thought. Let's quit now, while I'm ahead. </p> <p>I have been to many actors' homes, taken many meetings and talked about lots of different roles, but I don't recollect any as clearly as that one. A couple of days later I received a card which read 'Fur coat and pork pie hat?? Newman.'</p> <p>Later, he walked onto set, and the whole crew went silent. He looked at me. 'Where d'you want me?' I gabbled something barely coherent, and away we went. Within minutes he was just part of the team. People ask me, 'How did you direct Paul Newman?' I steal a quote from Robert Benton: 'I just cast him and kept my mouth shut.' He was very easy to be around, loved rehearsals, loved the company of other actors and the crew.</p> <p>As a rule I tried to delay calling him to the set until it was absolutely necessary. He was an old man, and I didn't want him standing around. He was cross: 'Why didn't you call me earlier? This is where all the fun is!' He had no ego, no entourage, no driver, he did not travel with assistants. You can often tell how much work an actor really wants to do by the size and style of their trailers. Some actors have vast trailers, full of scented candles and a chef who offers them two choices for lunch. Paul's trailer, though, was a stark cell. There was nothing in it at all. He had no interest in being in the trailer. He wanted to work. </p> <p>One day I offered to give him a ride to rehearsals. So I asked the teamster who was driving to swing by Paul's apartment. He became visibly nervous. So Paul got in the car and suddenly, having driven perfectly normally until this point, my driver took off like an absolute lunatic at 80 miles an hour through the centre of Chicago. Because in his book, he's not only driving Paul Newman the movie star, but also Paul Newman the racing-car driver. And Paul's just sitting there calmly, reading the front page of the New York Times. He continued casually perusing the headlines as we ducked and dived through the centre of Chicago. We finally screeched to a halt and Paul put down his paper and looked over his little specs and just said, 'Nice driving'. He was so cool.</p> <p>He talked about Joanne a lot, about what she had done with her life, running the Westport Playhouse. He loved the theatre. But not as much as he loved his wife. He said to me, 'Do you know what my definition of marriage is?' I said no. He said, 'Well, when we get in the elevator together, my wife checks my fly without even looking.'</p> <p>Paul was 76 when I worked with him on Road to Perdition. Conrad Hall, another great man who is now sadly gone, was the cinematographer. He was about Paul's age, and he'd also shot Harper, Cool Hand Luke and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, so they had been shooting together from their mid-thirties to their mid-seventies. They had grown old together. At one point he was shooting a close-up of Paul looking into a fire and I turned around to find that Conrad was crying as he lit the shot. I asked him what was wrong and he just said, 'He was so beautiful'. And I said, 'Well, he's beautiful now,' and Conrad repeated, 'Yes, but he was so beautiful.' I think he was crying for both of them. But unlike Conrad, who fought the idea of death, I always got the feeling that Paul was at peace with it. He knew what an incredible life he had led and how fortunate he had been. 'Yeah, I've had a great innings; it's about time I give all this up. It's all a bit silly.'</p> <p>A final image. He used to walk on his hands. I walked into the room twice when he was doing it. He was entertaining the kids on set, the two boys in the movie with whom he had an eccentric, fatherly relationship. He was immediately drawn to them, and they to him. He wanted to make them laugh. </p> <p>Paul Newman was a hero to me, and I dare say many millions of others. To be such a humble man, to be so eager to be as good as - or better than - he had ever been before. To have given so much to charity. To have raced those cars, been that cool. To have been such a good director. To have had that marriage. To have been Harper. And Hud. And Fast Eddie. And Butch Cassidy. And Cool Hand Luke. And through it all, to have retained his dignity. What a life.</p>",
  "<h2>In from the cold</h2> <p>Icelandic police thriller Jar City has become one of the year's surprise hits in the UK. I now understand that the film, directed by Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur, has also become the latest European hit scheduled for a Hollywood makeover. Overture Films have bought the remake rights and the action will now be transposed to small town Louisiana. I remarked in my review of the film that its protagonist, Detective Erlendur (played with pinched reserve by Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson) had the makings of a singular screen detective - he is the subject of several of Iceland's best-selling books by Arnaldur Indridason, and I hear there are several more Erlendur screen adventures planned. Korm\u00e1kur's latest film White Night Wedding, meanwhile, has this week been put forward as Iceland's official Oscar entry, and he has also just completed filming a dark Hollywood thriller called Run for Her Life. It shares Jar City's ghoulish anatomical themes - set in the world of black market organ transplants.</p> <h2>Elementary mistake?</h2> <p>Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes could just be a genius bit of casting. But can Guy Ritchie really make the new film work? Making Jude Law his Dr Watson seems risky to me - there were sharp intakes of breath when it was announced at a press conference in London last week.</p> <h2>Take the mike, Spike</h2> <p>Spike Lee is the latest addition to the stellar line-up at the London Film Festival. Trash can reveal that the director will now present his controversial new Second World War film, Miracle at St Anna, on the second day of the festival, 16 October. The film examines the role black troops - buffalo soldiers - played in defending a Tuscan town during a Nazi massacre in 1944, but it has already prompted outrage among Italian war veterans. Spike will, of course, be on hand to take questions after the screening. One other late addition to the LFF programme sees another Turner Prize winner join the world of cinema: alongside Steve McQueen's Hunger, the festival will now screen the world premiere of Jeremy Deller's pop fandom study, The Posters Came from the Walls, about the 'faith and devotion' of the world's Depeche Mode fans ...</p>",
  "<p>You know you are in for an unusual train ride when you are welcomed on board by a man called Attila. And then, while you are relaxing with a drink, you are serenaded by a piano player who calls himself Apollo. This is not your average crew on the 8.16 from Sevenoaks. But then the Danube Express is not your average rail service. Launched by Howard Trinder - former owner of Great Rail Journeys - the Express is his attempt to combine hedonistic rail travel and serious tourism with some relaxed entertainment. It is an ambitious goal, to say the least, and well worth testing. So, two weeks ago, I travelled by Eurostar from London to Paris, and then by Deutsche Bahn sleeper to Berlin, to experience the Danube Express on its maiden trip to Budapest.</p> <p>It was an incongruous first encounter. There in Berlin Ostbahnhof, amid the clamour of the morning rush-hour, stood eight gleaming coaches in blue, gold and white livery with uniformed staff and managers standing to attention on the platform. This was my introduction to Attila and Apollo, not to mention Andras, Gyorgyi and the train's other personnel. </p> <p>Their names betray the train's key influence, of course. The Danube Express is Hungarian to its axles. Indeed, Trinder - working with his Budapest-based partners MAV Nosztalgia - has specifically created his hotel-on-rails to follow routes used by the old Royal Hungarian Express while also aiming to combine modern comfort with some middle European retro-chic.</p> <p>The train itself is of mixed vintage: some carriages once belonged to the official train of Hungary's communist government, while its saloon car (plus piano) and spacious dining car were originally built in East Germany. Some carriages have classic, two-bunk sleepers while three coaches - previously used by the Hungarian postal service - have been completely revamped and fitted with deluxe compartments, each with an en-suite shower and toilet, air-conditioning, wood-panelling, deep-pile carpets, and enough space to swing a fairly substantial mammal.</p> <p>There are no bunks in deluxe, only two ground-level beds, which are made up by stewards while you are at dinner. The shower water was hot and plentiful (although the taps were fitted with timers) and even if one or two features still require a bit of attention - my shower faucet was stiff, for God's sake - it would be a churlish traveller who could not wallow in such luxury.</p> <p>And there lay my problem. The Danube Express has spoiled me for all future rail travel. I thought sleepers such as the Cologne-Copenhagen and the Oslo-Trondheim were luxurious but they couldn't hold a cabin light to this sybaritic excess, with its wardrobes, butler service, and plush upholstery. </p> <p>Then there was the food and drink. From the moment we boarded, champagne, wine and beer were being thrust down our throats. By the time we had reached Dresden (200km to the south), I had gone through a wide range of beverages as well as a lunch of sweet and sour soup, pork in green pepper sauce, Hungarian dill cheesecake, and most of a bottle of Szemelt riesling.</p> <p>Dresden itself was an eye-opener. The city was devastated on the night of 13 February 1945 when a massed Allied bombing raid destroyed its centre, killing more than 35,000 people in an act of warfare that remains controversial to this day. Four thousand tons of high explosives were dropped on the 'Florence of the Elbe', creating a firestorm that turned it into a pile of rubble. And that was what I expected to find: the pitted remains of a handful of baroque halls and mansions.</p> <p>In fact, the former East German city looks stunning thanks to a remarkable engineering renaissance that has restored its flattened Zwinger pavilions and halls, the wrecked Frauenkirche and a demolished statue of Martin Luther. Dresden today is a breathtaking sight.</p> <p>Then it was back to the train dinner: caviar, goose leg and cabbage; chocolate pancakes and more riesling, followed by drinks in the lounge car. And next morning, as we skimmed through the Tatra mountains, we breakfasted on large plates of bacon, eggs and toast before stopping for a brief tour of Kosice in Slovakia.</p> <p>The second city of Slovakia, Kosice has had no German wealth to help it into the 21st century and still has statues to Russian heroes, including General Ivan Petrov, leader of the Red Army that took the city from the German army in 1944, as well as a ring of crumbling blocks of Soviet-era flats. Most poignant of all is the city's old synagogue where thousands of Jews were gathered before being deported, by train, to Auschwitz. It puts a sobering perspective on rail travel. </p> <p>Kosice also has a fine Gothic cathedral and a very bad waxworks museum whose star exhibit is a model of Andy Warhol, whose family comes from the area. If nothing else, I now know the name of one famous Slovakian. We returned to the train for a lunch of savoury pancakes, duck, and cherry strudel. By the time we reached Budapest four hours later, I felt like Jabba the Hutt. We climbed off the train utterly satiated - only to find it had stopped opposite the old royal waiting rooms, once graced by Emperor Franz Joseph, and his wife Elizabeth, where a champagne reception was being held for us. It was a fine note on which to end the trip, though this constant attention and grand receptions were making me realise that being royalty might be a right pain at times.</p> <p>Of course, I could have tried a bit of self-control but that surely defeats the purpose of the Danube Express: extreme indulgence on rail tracks. It is not the only train to offer over-the-top luxury, of course, but it has one key difference from its rivals, including the Orient Express. These exist to take you - in style but nevertheless non-stop - from one grand city to another. The Danube Express makes a feature of stopping en route so travellers can indulge in a little light tourism.</p> <p>And given that the train has itineraries that take it through Prague, Novi Sad, Sofia and other cities of the former Soviet empire, travellers get a chance to experience some intriguing destinations. Our trips to Dresden and Kosice were certainly edifying.</p> <p>Such experiences do not come cheaply, of course. A journey on the Danube Express is pricey, particularly if you choose to go deluxe. A three-day trip will cost nearly \u00a32,000. On the other hand, this is a lavish experience and - equally importantly - it is fun. Some luxury trains have a smart dress code for dinner, for example. No such formality on the Danube Express. Indeed, informality is emphasised all the time - right down to the late-night sing-song round the piano which ended, on our trip, in a conga that took passengers snaking along the length of the train.</p> <p>I would like to say it was a spontaneous affair. In fact, it was heartily 'encouraged' by our waiters who clearly felt that their customers required a bit of enforced enjoyment. I thought of refusing to join in the conga but then changed my mind. You don't want to argue with a man called Attila, after all.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Robin McKie travelled on the Danube Express (01462 441400; <a href=\"http://www.danube-express.com\">danube-express.com</a>) on a three-day Central European trip between Berlin and Budapest.

  "<p>A new online drama follows a corporate role-play session, in which five City bankers act out increasingly unhinged responses to the credit crunch.

  "<p>A strike tomorrow will hamper the efforts by Eurostar (<a href=\"http://www.eurostar.com\">eurostar.com</a>) to rebuild its services after last month's fire.

  "<p>The black Fiat Punto, loaded with cocaine, broke through a road block near Casal di Principe in the hinterland of Naples. Policemen Francesco Alighieri and Gabriele Rossi gave chase. In the pursuit their car keeled off an overpass, wrapping itself around a tree, killing both of them. They had only been in the area a week, drafted from northern Italy following the murder of six Africans by the local Casalesi criminal syndicate. For hours afterwards the lanes around Casal di Principe were scattered with characters in sunglasses sitting in cars and talking on mobiles. Menacing, but hardly mysterious, for these are the sentinels of the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia which is about to achieve worldwide notoriety as the subject of a major new movie. Gomorrah, released this week, will bring worldwide attention to the Camorra: the most potent criminal organisation on the planet.</p> <p>The scenes described above are not from the film. The police chase took place nine days ago when I returned to the area 14 years after last reporting on the Camorra as Italy correspondent for the Guardian. This week the army was being mobilised into the area as three of the top Casalesi were arrested. </p> <p>Gomorrah won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May and was last week chosen as Italy's entry for the Foreign Language Oscar. It is based on a book by Roberto Saviano, who grew up in Casal di Principe and lived alongside the Casalesi clan of the Camorra, one of its most powerful and ruthless. His father, a doctor, was beaten and obliged to hide for months after treating a man the Camorra had wounded. Saviano saw his first corpse in the street when he was 13 but 'never got used to seeing murder victims'. After studying philosophy at Naples University, Saviano observed then wrote about the Camorra with brazen fearlessness. </p> <p>His book had a raw vividness, an attention to human detail and a dimension of outrage that caught public attention in a way that other diligent and brave reporters over decades have not. Now copies of Gomorrah are piled up for sale at every bookshop and motorway service station. It has sold 1.8 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. With the film, Saviano is even more famous, and more of a target. He was threatened by the bosses of his hometown clan and lives under 24-hour armed police watch 'somewhere,' he says, 'in the north of Italy'.</p> <p>We meet at his publishers, Mondadori, in Rome. 'I like these interviews,' he says. 'They give me some sense of space and communication. I live this enclosed life, physically and psychologically. First it was one guard, then two, three, four and five. Two bulletproof cars now. And I can never go home. I love the beauty of Naples, but what happens there I despise; that is what I wanted to write about and do something about.' </p> <p>Saviano made that decision after 14-year-old Annalisa Durante was killed in crossfire between Camorra factions. In the book he describes her friends at the funeral: 'Many of these girls will soon marry Camorristi... Many will bear children who will be killed ... But for now they are just little girls in black. They weep for a friend ... Annalisa is guilty of having been born in Naples. Nothing more, nothing less. As her body is being carried away in its white coffin, a classmate calls her on her cellphone. The ringing in the coffin is the new requiem... No one answers.'</p> <p>In conversation, he adds: 'That they could kill children like that reached a point beyond my understanding, and that moment I decided something had to be done.'</p> <p>The film of Gomorrah is savage, squalid, claustrophobic and relentless. The action is authentic, in gratifying contrast to the grotesque romance of films like The Godfather. 'All Camorristi love Scarface,' says Saviano. He cites newer role models - The Matrix and Pulp Fiction - as 'how the Camorristi want to see themselves'. Among the newly powerful women, Saviano points to a gangster called Immolata Capone who dresses in the same yellow as Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. Saviano calls his book a 'non-fiction novel'. 'There is no need to make anything up. Everything is from real life. Some things have been changed to protect people but I knew the people in this book.'</p> <p>For all their wealth, the Camorristi can be parsimonious. Last week I tracked down the flat in Via Canonico Stornaiuolo that was home to the boss who terrorised the Secondigliano district of Naples during the savage Camorra war which is backdrop to the film. I found a modest place of peeling plaster. When, in 2005, the police came for Paolo Di Lauro, whose empire was worth billions, the only personal assets they discovered were playing cards, cheap furniture, a TV, cigarettes and peppers drying on a newspaper. And this was the man who established what Saviano calls 'the biggest narcotraffic holding company, nationally or internationally' in the world.</p> <p>The English edition of Saviano's book is subtitled Italy's Other Mafia in recognition of the incorrect supposition among British and American readers that the Sicilian Mafia is the premier organisation. The Neapolitan Camorra was Italy's original Mafia by a century; it commands a higher turnover - and a higher body count than any criminal syndicate in the world: 4,000 over the past four decades.</p> <p>I was unaware of this when I started to report from Italy in 1990. The Camorra first attracted international attention in 1991 when it was found to have ensnared the footballing Messiah of Naples, Diego Maradona. He bought his cocaine from the Camorra, and became a trophy for the bosses, photographed in their shell-shaped baths and at weddings of their children. 'It is a very strong identity, to be Neapolitan,' says Saviano. 'You love the place, and you hate it. I am estranged from it now, which is extremely difficult.' </p> <p>Naples is a proud but battered city where life is agrodolce, bittersweet: a city of breathtaking beauty but perched on a fault line and nestled under a volcano. Much of life is lived in shadow yet there can be no secrets in the warrens of alleyways, steps and courtyards from which great domes and fa\u00e7ades of tatty baroque churches rise like cliffs from the old stone propped up by scaffolding. Naples is the last great pagan city - of dolls, puppets, cards, magic and the significance of numbers, with which Neapolitans interpret dreams. Naples has a bright face but the Vesuvian city is ridden with the apocalyptic cult of death. After Maradona's Napoli won its first ever championship in 1987, graffiti appeared on the cemetery wall: 'You don't know what you missed.' Next day came the reply: 'Don't be so sure we missed it.' </p> <p>The Camorra was forged at the time of backlash against the revolutionary French republic of Naples. Into the vacuum between a liberal intelligentsia and reactionary elite, the Camorra moved as 'protection' for the masses in Europe's third city and, crucially, its biggest port, a portal for smugglers and extortionists. The Italian Mafia was first crushed by, then absorbed into, Mussolini's fascist regime. As Tom Behan writes in See Naples and Die, the rebirth of the modern Camorra was ironically due to the return of its Sicilian rival after the war. But the Camorra and Mafia were different - the former urban, the latter rural; the Neapolitans bound only by criminal commercial interest, the latter by family ties also. The Sicilians subscribed to a veneer of 'honour' to which the Camorra paid little heed. The Camorra has been more cynically flexible than Cosa Nostra, more fickle in its recruitment, loyalties and hostilities.</p> <p>Only one Camorra boss seriously allied himself to the Sicilians: Michele Zaza (aka Michel O'Pazz or Mad Mike), a shrewd smuggler-turned-gangster. Others saw no need to be bound to Cosa Nostra, markedly Raffaele Cutolo, who in the 1970s founded the New Organised Camorra, re-establishing Neapolitan control. The earthquake of 1980 relaunched the Camorra in terms of capital with some \u00a316bn earmarked for reconstruction siphoned off by gangsters and by politicians building themselves villas while some made homeless by the earthquake were still billeted in a lunatic asylum in Naples in 1993. The looted funds stoked the first Camorra civil war between Cutolo and the 'New Family' of clans led by Zaza and his heir, Carmine Alfieri. By 1991 a courageous Naples examining judge called Paolo Mancuso was able to tell me that the Camorra had overtaken Cosa Nostra as a criminal business operation but that 'what marks them out is that their legal income is now greater than their illegal one. The Camorra has become a social, financial and political institution.' </p> <p>The Camorra's coup was to realise that cocaine rather than heroin would become the drug of super-liquidity. They built international connections accordingly, in Colombia, Venezuela, Spain and along the French Riviera. They became the first capitalist operation to penetrate post-communist Eastern Europe, to deal in drugs, clothing and arms, in particular Kalashnikovs made under Soviet licence, with which the Camorra can now equip any army or militia suffering an embargo or supply problem. The profits were so great that the Camorra was obliged to invest imaginatively and semi-legally: in construction (it built much of the Costa del Sol), football pools and gambling, agriculture, car franchises, tourism, banks, social services, prostitution, waste disposal and textiles - even haute-couture, whether 'Made in Italy' or 'Made in China'. </p> <p>The Camorra had meanwhile entwined itself with senior Christian Democrats and other politicians to form a terrifying power machine in Naples. Thousands in Naples owed their livelihoods to either Byzantine political patronage or to the Camorra, or both. There were no rights, only privileges for those who paid the Camorra or a politician in cash or votes. </p> <p>Through the collapse of Christian Democracy and the advent of a leftist local authority and a right-wing Silvio Berlusconi to national government, the system remained intact. Saviano explains that few in Naples use the term 'Camorra' any more. The clans call themselves 'Sistema'- the System. It is impregnable, like cement, he says. </p> <p>'Cement' is the title of Saviano's chapter about his home town, the stuff of construction, legal or illegal, completed buildings or those left paid for but abandoned as concrete skeletons. 'Successful Italian businessmen come from cement,' says Saviano. 'Before transforming themselves into fashion models, managers, financial sharks and owners of newspapers and yachts, before all this and under all this lies cement.' The English translation, for some baffling reason, castrates the climax to this passage, which in Italian reads: cemento armato - armed cement. </p> <p>The last article I filed from Italy, in March 1994, concerned the Camorra's execution of Father Giuseppe Diana, or Don Peppino, as he prepared the host in his church in Casal di Principe. Saviano, then 16, knew him, and remembers the Christmas Day on which he distributed a tract defying the Camorra. It was the worst form of denunciation for murderers who think of themselves as Catholics. </p> <p>Saviano recalls how rival Casalesi clans, in order to show that the murder was not their doing, pledged to find the killer. Saviano, meanwhile, was thinking about the power of the word. 'While Don Peppino's assassins were talking about cutting up flesh to seal their position,' he wrote, in the book's pivotal passage, 'I was still thinking about the priest's battle and the primacy of the word... words against cement mixers and guns... to testify, take a stand. The only way to eliminate a word like that is to kill it.' Which is what the Camorra wants to do to Saviano, now it has disposed of Don Peppino. </p> <p>'If that book had sold 10,000 copies, they would not have had the slightest fear, and I would still have my freedom,' he says. 'But so many people have now read about who they are, and this they cannot forgive. They have been denied their romance.' </p> <p>Part of the book and all of the film is set in Secondigliano, heartland of the Camorra. That is where I found myself last week on Corso Secondigliano. Turn right at the heavily fortified 'Penitentiary Centre', and there they are: the Vele (the Sails, because of their shape), hideous blocks built in the 1960s, turned into the biggest drug marketplace in the world, and then its most ferocious criminal battlefield. This neighbourhood is called Scampia, one-time fiefdom of a man few outsiders had heard of until 1998, when a teacher ticked off his son's girlfriend for being lazy in school, and was beaten senseless. In 2002 police traced 160kg of heroin and cocaine to his door. A man called Paolo Di Lauro, aka Ciruzzo the Millionaire. </p> <p>Di Lauro's trafficking system was so pervasive that Saviano details a lucrative scheme for local pensioners, who could get a good return by putting their savings into cocaine. 'No substance gets introduced into the European market without first passing through Secondigliano,' writes Saviano, describing the squalid inferno of product tests carried out on pathetic addicts to gauge the effects of 'cutting' drugs, and then the war which followed a revolt against Di Lauro by lieutenants wanting a bigger share, and Di Lauro's terrible revenge.</p> <p>One ventures into the Vele with trepidation. Many of the apartments are empty, some burned out. But people are surprisingly ready to talk, not about the Camorra per se ('What Camorra?' says one man) but about the film. 'I was in it!' boasts a girl. 'In the bit when they kill the lady at the end! You can see me!' </p> <p>A woman whispers hoarsely on a stinking walkway between front doors: 'There is nothing that hasn't happened here. I read his book too. It's true, every word, God bless him.' </p> <p>'When the cameras arrived,' says Saviano, 'most people wanted to be part of it, to advise on how to make the film and get it right. Once the people had decided they wanted the film to be made there, there was nothing the Camorra could do. They didn't want this film but they had to allow it. That alone was something.' </p> <p>Casal di Principe is the fiefdom of the Casalesi clan and now-jailed boss Francesco Schiavone, called Sandokan after the pirate. He strangled the heir to the leadership with his bare hands at a cartel meeting, then became the mogul of Camorra construction, arms dealing and garbage disposal. I pull up at the Caffe Penelope, attacked by Sandokan's men during the Casalesi wars, and make some stupid remark in nostalgic praise of Maradona to a man at the bar reading a football paper. I ask if he has read Saviano's book. He stirs sugar into his coffee and replies with a nod, then a stare and silent grimace which says, today of all days, with those cops dead: 'Don't try to talk. Leave.' My appointment here with one of the bravest reporters in Italy, Rosaria Capacchione, has been postponed because of the car chase and three important arrests of Camorristi, which she must cover for her paper, Il Mattino. One of a roll of honour of brave writers on the Mafia, of whom Saviano is the most prominent, Rosaria works the area under police guard, and no wonder. Only the other day she was again singled out, along with Saviano, by lawyers for Camorristi in the dock at neighbouring Santa Maria Capua Vetere for her reporting on a trial. The Casalesi have wanted Rosaria dead since 1995 when she was tailed by gunmen after revealing the contents of two supergrass confessions against Sandokan while he was still at liberty.</p> <p>As Saviano says: 'The Mafia makes for the best and the worst. It's hard to find the best sometimes but it is there - the tenacity of the good people in this battle, which seems so hopeless. No Italian political party can fight an election campaign by going against the Mafia. Politics is an alibi - there is this idea that if you have politics that is corrupt you have the Mafia, and if you had clean politics, the Mafia would disappear. It's not like that. Political parties cannot rid us of the Camorra because the Camorra has no politics beyond the money it makes; no ideology apart from its business interests. This can only be done by getting at their economy and their roots in society. And the way to do this is by mobilising civil society, challenging the way they operate, refusing to take part.' </p> <p>In last week's L'espresso magazine Saviano lambasted the passive complicity of the city's middle class - Napoli Bene, as they are called - confronted in this particular case by a story linking the undersecretary of state for economy in Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet, Nicola Cosentino, and senior local politicians from his party, with the garbage disposal rackets run by the Camorra. Saviano says: 'The reaction of this strata [the middle class] has been \"So what?\" or \"Why should that amaze you - isn't that how things work?\" The professional ranks, the intellectuals, the employers - in short, the bourgeoisie of Campania which is always seen as a noble stratum - seems incapable of protesting.' </p> <p>'I have no illusions about the fascination with the Camorra, with the bosses,' concludes Saviano. 'To say they have no fascination is a lie. I'm not going to say that you don't earn more money or that you will not get more pretty women if you become a Camorrista. But what do you do then? You can't leave where you live, you can't talk to anyone apart from your own kind, and the only women you will meet are the ex-girlfriends of your own men. And possibly you'll end up dead.'</p> <p>And what about his readers? Are they too caught up in morbid fascination? 'What is so fascinating about torturing a girl to death or shooting an innocent teenager? What I want to do is recognise the fantasy, take hold of it and take it apart.' </p> <p>\u2022 Gomorrah the film is out on Friday.

  "<p>It was billed as the 'craziest and most exclusive car rally ever', a strictly invitation-only event in which wannabe playboys drove high-performance Ferraris, Porsches, Lamborghinis and Bentleys to Europe's most exotic cities, where they partied with glamour models as if the credit crunch had never happened.</p> <p>But yesterday the organisers of the Carbon Black rally, in which 60 drivers raced 30 vehicles across five countries from the UK to Monaco, experienced a different sort of crunch after two of their vehicles were involved in a collision while allegedly trying to outrun Italian police. Now the cars have been confiscated and the drivers fined.</p> <p>The crash has highlighted the increasingly high-risk nature of the unofficial road races that are alarming police on the continent, who say there are now around eight similar events each year. </p> <p>A burgeoning industry operating the events, which cost tens of thousands of pounds to participate in, has sprung up in the UK over the past decade. But as the events' profiles have increased, so, too, have the accidents. Last year, a husband and wife in Macedonia died when their VW Golf was hit by a Porsche 911 Carrera driven by two Britons competing in the better-known Gumball rally, whose celebrity participants have included Vic Reeves and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.</p> <p>This time the collision was of a more modest nature, although police say it could have been much worse. </p> <p>The crash happened after the drivers of three of the competing cars raced down a mountain motorway in Liguria, in north-west Italy. Startled motorists alerted police as a red Ferrari, a black Lamborghini Murcielago and a yellow Porsche 911 picked up speed just outside the village of Carrodano, where the road begins a steep descent into a series of tunnels and bridges on the way into Genoa. </p> <p>Clinging to rocks, the highway affords stunning views over the Mediterranean, but is often clogged with trucks and slow-moving traffic. As more motorists called in to express alarm, patrol cars picked up the trail of the super-cars that were reportedly swerving around the Italian drivers observing the 110kmh speed limit. </p> <p>In an alleged attempt to avoid the police, the Lamborghini veered off the road at an exit, slowing down rapidly to make a turn. Following closely, the \u00a3130,000 Porsche collided with the rear of the \u00a3200,000 super-car, while the Ferrari skipped the exit and sped off towards the French border. 'We hope to get him,' the officer said. 'A red Ferrari is more difficult to hide than a Fiat 500.'</p> <p>After confiscating the Porsche and the Lamborghini, Italian police condemned the drivers for 'threatening the lives' of other motorists, but praised their 'gentlemanly apologies and good behaviour'.</p> <p>The two men were stripped of their licences and face fines of up to \u20ac5,000, as well the permanent seizure of their cars. 'We have enough deaths on this road as it is,' the officer added. 'However polite these people are, they should know races belong on the racetrack.' </p> <p>Police said the two men, one believed to be in his forties and the other in his thirties, were calm as they climbed out of their mangled cars and tested negative for alcohol. According to the Carbon Black website, Mark Hinchcliffe from Surrey was listed as the main driver of the Porsche. The main driver of the Lamborghini, which is registered in Germany, is thought to come from Cheshire.</p> <p>'They were in a hurry to get to Monte Carlo and, after we had gone through the paperwork, an English friend in a Range Rover arrived to take them there,' said the officer. </p> <p>Perhaps it was no surprise the men were in a rush. The party in Monte Carlo promised to be one to remember, according to organisers. 'After dropping off the cars, we will set sail on board our very own luxury super-yacht, with the drinks flowing and the party pumping. We will watch the sun go down as we turn up the heat for the most extravagant party Carbon Black has ever staged!' the events organisers promised on their website.</p> <p>Carbon Black is owned by Paul 'Nods' Naden, a 39-year-old businessman who made a fortune selling his personal loans business. 'Carbon Black is strictly invitation-only and provides a more exhilarating, exclusive and extravagant alternative to other over-commercialised rallies,' it boasts on its website.</p> <p>Naden is clearly turning his pleasure into a business. According to one report, he owns four Ferraris, three Lamborghinis, two Porsches and a Bentley Continental GT. He also has a property in the luxury Sandbanks complex in Dorset. In addition to Carbon Black, he owns a stake in a Serbian steel factory and his portfolio includes properties in the UK and eastern Europe, a golf course in South Africa and a lingerie business. </p> <p>'Money is a measure of success, but it's the challenge of being the best that I enjoy the most,' he said in one interview.</p> <p>Carbon Black seems to reflect his luxurious tastes. A sophisticated internet site and a satellite tracking system allow fans to follow the race and watch video clips and photos of the cars and parties. Other vehicles competing in the race include a McLaren SLR, Porsche Cayenne and an Audi R8.</p> <p>Starting out at a stately home, Stapleford Park in Leicestershire, competitors enjoyed archery and clay pigeon shooting before they were flown by private jet to Prague for a night of 'chilled' partying. Then it was a race to Budapest, where the competitors were booked into what organisers describe as the city's 'hippest' fusion restaurant, before making the journey into Italy. </p> <p>Along the way, drivers were joined by an array of lingerie models who helped them party at the end of each day. Carbon Black's website shows the women in a variety of poses and outfits and boasts their parties are 'like no other'. A promotional video promises this year's event would deliver even more 'wild times' than the rally last year across Eastern Europe.</p> <p>But such antics are starting to provoke a backlash. The events' image as an extended jolly for privileged trustafarians who show little concern for speed limits has seen them lose some of their allure. </p> <p>Following the fatal collision last year, the Gumball rally was temporarily scrapped. An internet hate campaign sprang up against the event, which was quickly relabelled 'Scumball', and authorities in Germany and Turkey subsequently banned it. Nicholas Morley, a property developer, received a suspended sentence for his part in the fatal crash. His brother, Oliver, was participating in this year's Carbon Black event.</p> <p>There are suggestions that similar events, such as the Bullrun in the United States and Carbon Black, may have been tarnished by such negative publicity. Indeed it is not the first time the Carbon Black rally has found itself attracting headlines for the wrong reasons. Two years ago, seven of its competitors were fined for driving at up to 200kph on motorways in south-west France, where the speed limit is 130kph.</p> <p>Yesterday a spokeswoman for Carbon Black declined to comment on the latest controversy to befall the company. Naden, she said, could not be contacted. </p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Hannah Gousy</p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Blair's sacking by Boris Johnson and his deputy Kit Malthouse may mark the regrettable politicisation of the job of the country's most senior police officer, but Sir Ian and the Labour government have only themselves to blame. The job acquired a political character well before these two amateur assassins came along on their Lambretta and managed to get in a couple of lucky shots while the attention of the boss of all bosses at the Home Office was averted or at least diverted.</p> <p>If Sir Ian, a good Labour soldier in several ways and not an unsympathetic man, had not gone out on so many limbs at the same time and struggled with so many difficulties of his own making, Jacqui Smith may have saved him. 'It is the job of responsible politicians to support those who have to carry a heavy operations burden,' she said. She railed against the hitmen, cried that form was not being observed and dwelt on Sir Ian's noble service, but where was her protection? On the basis of national security alone, she could surely have outgunned Boris and Kit. But she did not and that tells us all we need to know about Sir Ian's demise and quite a lot about Ms Smith's hypocrisy.</p> <p>He was hit as a politician, not a servant. He was hit because he was fatally weakened by bad luck, scandal and a poor management style. He had moved on the stage, giving us his opinion on everything from 90-day detention without trial to the Iraq War, ID cards and the 'institutionalised racism' of the media in a way no other commissioner of the Met had done before. He appeared on Any Questions, he mused about a new national policing policy very much like a Home Secretary but without the long apprenticeship it takes to occupy that harsh spotlight. He made gaffes and poor decisions, particularly over the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes, and the awarding of a \u00a33m contract to his friend Andy Miller.</p> <p>Kit Malthouse insisted the sacking was not about politics but 'effective policing'. But then we hear that Mr Johnson expressed his hope that a new commissioner would not be appointed until a Conservative was installed as Home Secretary. There could be no more convincing evidence that he was using the terms of the new mayor's office, set out by Labour, to push the job towards an applicant carrying a Conservative rewards card. It seems unlikely that Ms Smith will go along with that plan and surely Mr Johnson cannot wish the Metropolitan Police to be without settled leadership over the next 18 months, during which time we must assume the terrorist threat will oscillate through that fractional distance between critical and the 'severe end of severe'.</p> <p>Effective policing? By the standards of the past - i.e. crime figures - he did reasonably well. This year, he could boast - and did so frequently - that despite the appearance of epidemic knife crime there was a 14 per cent fall over the last year and an equivalent decline in gun crime. Youth crime was down 7 per cent and there were 21 fewer murders in London. But this core responsibility means less than it used to, especially when the media are convinced that crime is going up whatever the statistical reality. Moreover, Sir Ian could point to the successful introduction of community policing and a reduction of the problems of racism at New Scotland Yard, although the cases of Tarique Ghaffur and Shabir Hussain may give the lie to that claim.</p> <p>But there were other aspects of his reign at New Scotland Yard that clearly did not please the mayor and his deputy. Sir Ian was New Labour and insufferably PC. He displayed the party's inclusive values but also its fascination with control. With good reason, the National Union of Journalists complains that the Met is now harassing journalists and photographers and preventing them covering demonstrations. </p> <p>More serious was the conduct of the police during protests against President Bush's visit in June when it was alleged that unreasonable violence was used against the marchers. The surveillance and pursuit of legitimate demonstrators three months afterwards is to say the least very worrying. It smacks of a police state. Referring to the surveillance society in his column in the Times last January, Mr Malthouse wrote: 'In this atmosphere of growing fear and control, an unelected commissioner making and influencing policy should rightly make us all nervous. Sir Ian is either a policeman or a politician, but he can't continue to be both.'</p> <p>Evidently, they decided he was the latter and they have a point. Very few public servants or corporate leaders would have remained in office after a jury returned the guilty verdict in the de Menezes trial but a politician would try. It was interesting that Sir Ian received the backing of that archdeacon of brazen tenacity, Ken Livingstone, who said the guilty verdict made it more difficult for the police to protect the capital from terrorism. Instead of uttering this falsity, Mr Livingstone should have insisted on Sir Ian's resignation. </p> <p>But even without that guidance, Sir Ian should have seen that the game was up. In the absence of honour and with the failure of the government to act on an important principle, the mayor and his deputy took the right course. Sir Ian had to go. If he hadn't agreed last week, sooner or later a confidence motion would have been passed by the Metropolitan Police Authority, which the mayor chairs with Mr Malthouse at his side. </p> <p>It was a political solution to a political problem. This is hardly surprising when so many public servants have been bent to Labour's cause during the last 11 years. Many roles that used to call for neutrality have been politicised. The office of Britain's most senior policeman succumbed to the trend partly because of Sir Ian's showboating style and partly because of the new dynamics caused by Labour's creation of the mayor of London.</p> <p>The result is that the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, a role with national and local responsibilities, has suddenly become prey to the specific requirements of the capital's political establishment. That scrutiny may be welcome - certainly in this case - but it means that a new commissioner will have to look over his shoulder in two directions - to the Home Office and the mayor's office - and that may result in less clarity of direction and more time spent keeping sweet two bosses who may be members of different political parties.</p> <p>This is to be regretted. Anyone who has watched the masterly American TV series, The Wire, will appreciate that time spent on politics is time spent away from police work. The political element of a police chief's life in one of the big cities of America often overwhelms the interests of sensible and proportionate policing and that is something we do not want to replicate in every big city in Britain if we are to have more elected mayors. Even worse would be the idea of electing chief constables because democracy in policing does not always result in efficiency and good service to the community. </p> <p>This affair underlines the importance of the idea of dispassionate service in big public jobs. Quite apart from the meltdown in the senior management at New Scotland Yard, there was an absence in Sir Ian of this official humility, the notion that the police are not our masters but our servants, a point stressed by the many chief constables who insist on referring not to the police force but to the police service.</p>",
  "<p>Dressed in a shimmery grey suit, his tidy hair just so, singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson doesn't look like a tragi-comic figure. But he is. Literate and candid, Thompson's songs are usually desperately sad. On his latest album, A Piece Of What You Need, however, they are most often delivered with an upbeat swing. Tonight there's even the odd fanfare of synthesised trumpet from his otherwise dextrous keyboard player, Daniel Mintseris. Thompson's entire career is palpably teetering on the brink of stardom, or oblivion. In front of an audience, though, he plays it all for laughs.</p> <p>'You were supposed to be on Jonathan Ross!' shouts a voice in the crowd. Thompson pauses. 'I was busy,' he deadpans. The reality, it emerges, had something to do with being snowed in. Fiddling with his guitar strings, he looks up again. 'My big break.' A grin. 'Broken.' </p> <p>Thompson's wry repartee may be partly genetic. The son of British folk-rockers Richard and Linda Thompson, Teddy served an early apprenticeship in his father's band, absorbing his father's public wit nightly. </p> <p>Having luminaries for parents set a high bar for the singer-songwriter but Richard and Linda are not the only tall trees on Thompson's terrain. He is part of a cabal of second-generation songwriters that includes Rufus and Martha Wainwright. They guest on each other's records; record and perform tributes to Leonard Cohen (Cohen was in their parents' cabal, and his daughter, Lorca, is close to Rufus). But Rufus is finally successful and Thompson isn't yet.</p> <p>Since the release of his debut album in 2000, Thompson has also been banjaxed by that cruellest of burdens, critical acclaim. As well as exposing music critics as impotent gasbags with no clout, it puts artists in a tortuous position. If I'm so good - they must think - why is nobody buying my stuff? </p> <p>But Thompson sounds nothing like an underdog. Unlike Rufus Wainwright, whose ornate songs dwell firmly in the realms of art, Thompson has always been a pop-oriented singer with a blatant love of country music. Neil Finn of Crowded House and Chris Isaak are key references. Live, the chance of being goosed by a Thompson key change or bowled over by a sudden rhythmic departure are virtually nil. He plays it straight, confidently straddling the middle of the musical road - albeit with songs about suicide and scorn. </p> <p>His ease and humour are infectious, however, making the obviousness of the music less of an issue. He cracks jokes about his bankability, his album ('buy a spare!'), his sexuality (he likes to keep people guessing, but probably straight), and the old Motown trick of playing the gig's first song again at the end. So we get newie 'In My Arms' twice, a pleasure rather than a chore. The second time, people are dancing. </p> <p>The vast part of his band's set is taken up by the rest of A Piece Of What You Need. Thompson's third album of original songs has had near-universal critical acclaim, despite the heinously punchy production of Marcus de Vries (a veteran of Rufus Wainwright's records). It feels like the last roll of the dice for Thompson, the singer-songwriter courting a mainstream audience. With any luck, November's support slot on the James Blunt tour should boost sales. He (inadvertently?) refers to this forthcoming arena run at the end, when thanking the audience. 'You're beautiful,' he twinkles. </p> <p>Happily, de Vries has been confined to the studio and tonight the new songs slot easily into Thompson's country power-pop idiom. 'One Of These Days' is so jolly it jars but 'Where To Go From Here' packs both subtleties and a bit of ukulele.</p> <p>By contrast, Thompson's second album, 2005's Separate Ways, was a lustrous gem, full of doleful songs about rancid love. He plays a handful of songs from it on his own tonight, focusing on the festering bitterness of the title track and 'Everybody Move It', a masterwork about the joylessness of parties. </p> <p>Humour's relationship to misery is a complex one, and Thompson is probably guilty of selling his potent blues short. The most moving song on his latest album is 'Turning The Gun On Myself', a tune about suicide delivered tonight with great skill. But it, too, is played for laughs. Thompson reveals that they had to take the closing gunshot sound off the track because otherwise 'Walmart wouldn't stock the album'. A pause. 'Walmart stock guns!' At the end of this elegant downer, the gunshot is reinstated. Everyone laughs, robbing Thompson of the gravitas he deserves.</p>",
  "<p>A worldwide economic crisis can make a lot of difference to a voter. Or at least it has done to Isabelle Murawski. For the past two elections, the pensioner has reliably voted for George W Bush, casting her ballot in Florida's Broward County, one of the epicentres of the voting debacle that saw Bush win the White House in 2000. </p> <p>But now Murawski is going to vote for Barack Obama. 'I am supporting Obama, I think,' she said, while strolling in Florida's warm sunshine in the coastal resort town of Hollywood. 'It's the economy first and foremost. Everyone I know is worried about their pensions.'</p> <p>Murawski is not alone in switching sides in Florida. In the past few weeks the polls in this vital southern swing state have taken a remarkable turn. After long months of the Republican candidate John McCain being comfortably ahead, Obama has suddenly surged forward. Four recent polls have put Obama between four and eight points ahead in Florida. It is a hugely significant development. McCain almost certainly cannot win the keys of the White House without Florida's 27 precious electoral college votes. 'There is clearly something going on. There has been a solid swing to Obama,' said Professor Lance DeHaven-Smith, who is a political scientist at Florida State University.</p> <p>The development mirrors a trend nationwide. In the face of the economic disaster gripping America, the presidential race has undergone yet another about-face. Voters have broken narrowly but firmly for Obama, and McCain has seen his support wither in the face of the crisis. Polls consistently show Obama with a solid four or five-point lead. Previously long-shot Republican states like North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia have suddenly become Democratic possibilities. In the meantime, McCain's campaign has decided to pull out of Michigan, writing off the state in favour of easier targets. </p> <p>But it is Florida that all eyes have now turned to. An Obama victory there would virtually assure that America gets its first ever black President. It would also go some way to purging the dreadful scars still lingering in the Democratic psyche after the disputed 2000 election result. No Democrat can ever forget the saga of the hanging chads - the spoiled ballot papers that led to a protracted recount and a United States Supreme Court ruling which ensured that Bush won both Florida and the White House.</p> <p>Now eight years of Republican rule could end in the very same state where they began. 'I think a lot of Democrats in Florida would finally feel vindicated,' said DeHaven-Smith.</p> <p>The key to winning in Florida is a 132-mile stretch of busy road known as Interstate 4, or I-4. The road cuts across the heart of the state, stretching from Tampa Bay to Daytona Beach. It is both the literal and metaphorical middle ground of Florida politics. It bridges the gap between the Republican core of northern Florida, which is very much a part of the conservative Deep South, and the large Democrat-leaning cities of the south-east, such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale. </p> <p>This so-called 'I-4 corridor' is home to most of Florida's independent voters and is some of the hardest contested political turf in the whole of America. At its heart is the sprawling city of Orlando and the fierce battle that is being waged there seems to be being won by Obama. Certainly Terrence Golden, a kitchen manager at an Orlando restaurant, is backing Obama. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of transplants to the I-4 corridor who have come south seeking jobs and sunshine and was in no doubt as to where his vote was going. 'McCain is more of the same - just look at all the mess they have created already. We need a change,' he said.</p> <p>Obama is hoping to capitalise on a lot more voters like Golden. So far, the effort has gone well. His campaign has spent vast amounts of cash in Florida and set up a large organisation to register new voters, especially among blacks and students. It has 350 paid staff in the state, compared with 70 working for McCain. It has outspent its rival by $8m. Obama's political ads have saturated the airwaves and surrogate campaigners, such as Bill and Hillary Clinton and General Wesley Clark, have regularly been on the stump, along with Obama himself. </p> <p>It has worked. Registered Democrats now outnumber Republicans by some half a million. The campaign has registered 110,000 new black voters alone - they support Obama over McCain by a margin of nine to one. </p> <p>'The Obama campaign has been extremely effective and aggressive in Florida. Now, turnout on election day is the key thing that could decide it. Will these new voters actually come to the polls?' said Professor Susan McManus, of the University of South Florida.</p> <p>Other factors have also played into Obama's hands. Florida's large population of retired pensioners has been acutely sensitive to the recent financial crisis, worrying over pension funds and nest eggs. The state, much of which seems covered in new housing, has also been badly hit by foreclosures. In both cases, voters seem to be putting the blame squarely at the feet of the Republican party.</p> <p>Obama has also made strong inroads among Florida's Hispanic population. Traditionally, the state's Spanish-speaking citizens have been Republican-friendly and dominated by Cuban-Americans with hawkish foreign policy views. However, in recent years Florida has seen a large influx of non-Cuban Hispanics, among whom Obama has been performing strongly. As a result, recent polls have Obama winning Florida's Hispanic vote by 49 to 43 per cent. A wave of Spanish-language ads will surely have helped that process.</p> <p>There is little doubt that Florida's Republicans are in something of a panic about recent developments. Last week leading party officials met in the city of Tallahassee for a secret war council to discuss how to fight back. The hour-long meeting, hosted by Florida's Republican party chairman Jim Greer, was described by one official as 'tense'. That was music to the ears of the Democrats, who are now plotting to solidify their lead and turn once reliably red Florida firmly blue. 'If the Democrats win Florida, it will be like gravy for them. It will be the icing on the cake,' said McManus.</p> <p>But it is clearly far too early for Obama supporters to declare a Florida victory. The remarkable 2008 election has had a staggering array of twists and turns. The only certain thing appears to be: expect the unexpected. It could all easily turn around again in the last four weeks of the campaign. Back on the streets of Hollywood, support for McCain is still very easy to find. Jack Smile owns a small jewellery and gift shop on the main street. He has run it for 13 years and is suffering in the current economic crisis. </p> <p>But Smile is sticking with McCain, seeing Obama as too inexperienced and na\u00efve compared against McCain's long record in office and his Vietnam war heroics. 'Obama does not have the experience like McCain. McCain has fought for this country. He has undertaken real service,' Smile said.</p> <p>Such comments serve as a reminder that McCain's campaign and core message still resonate deeply in Florida. The state has a huge population of military veterans, who represent one of McCain's core areas of demographic support. It also boasts a large Jewish population, often retired, who favour McCain for his consistently hawkish foreign policy and staunch support of Israel. </p> <p>McCain's choice of Sarah Palin, the Alaskan governor, as a running mate has also been a big hit in the state, especially after her feisty and reputation-saving performance in the vice-presidential debate last week. Palin has drawn huge crowds across Florida and her folksy charm and strong religious background have been a boost to the state's evangelicals who are key to the Republicans' 'get out the vote' efforts on election day. Smile was a big fan of Palin. 'After he picked Palin, that kind of persuaded me. She talks to the people. She is very appealing,' he said.</p> <p>Such a view is common in Florida, which is why no one is declaring that the battle for the state is over. 'It could easily swing back and forth again,' said McManus. McCain's camp still has formidable resources to deploy. Although outnumbered in terms of staff, it has many more campaign offices in Florida than Obama. It also raised twice as much cash in the state as Obama in August, a sure sign of strong support when people put their money where they say their vote is. Republicans also have tactical options left to them as the campaign enters its final stages. </p> <p>Many experts expect the party's formidable attack machine to crank up issues around Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, in the last couple of weeks of electioneering. That could have a big effect in a southern state like Florida, where racial prejudices can still play a role at the polls, and where Wright's black nationalism is likely to scare many white voters. </p> <p>'You have to think that will happen. It is an obvious card to play, and if I am thinking of it, you can bet highly paid Republican campaign advisers have thought of it too,' said Professor Aubrey Jewett, a political expert at the University of Central Florida.</p> <p>There is also the looming spectre of a repeat of the debacle of 2000. Florida's voting laws and the technologies inside the voting booths have chopped and changed since that election ended up being decided in the courts. The state has moved from paper ballots to computers, and back to paper again. But few experts think the system is flawless or 100 per cent trustworthy. </p> <p>Any close election in Florida, or one marred by dirty tricks, could easily end up a disaster. Indeed, both sides have already accused the other of dubious activities regarding voter registration.</p> <p>'We are likely to see a lot of confusion at the polls, and in a close election that could be a real problem,' said DeHaven-Smith, raising the prospect of a possible return to the law courts after election day. That seems almost unimaginable. Certainly a strong Obama supporter like Golden does not want to think about it. He was confident of a Democratic win in the state. 'Obama, no drama!' he joked, repeating an Obama campaign slogan. </p> <p>But that is likely to prove a futile hope. When the White House itself is at stake and when Florida could make or break a presidential campaign, drama is likely to be the norm, not the exception.</p>",
  "<p>Britain should refuse to comply with a European arrest warrant requesting the extradition to Germany of a man accused of Holocaust denial, the Liberal Democrats said today. </p> <p>Australian citizen Frederick Toben was arrested on Wednesday at Heathrow, en route from the United States to Dubai, and has been remanded in custody awaiting an extradition hearing on October 17. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said that people should not be handed over to courts abroad for Holocaust denial, which is not a crime in the UK and raised issues of freedom of speech. </p> <p>The former MEP said that countries could \"pick and choose\" the cases in which they would apply warrants issued by fellow EU member states, citing the case of Belgium, which has said it would not send suspects to Poland on murder charges which related to abortion. </p> <p>Huhne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"There is a clear precedent for doing this and I think we should in this case.\" </p> <p>Toben was detained under an EU arrest warrant issued by the District Court in Mannheim, Germany, which accuses him of publishing material on the internet \"of an anti-semitic and/or revisionist nature\". </p> <p>While stressing that he was completely opposed to anti-semitism, Huhne said: \"We don't in this country tend to prosecute people for issues that we regard as issues of freedom of speech. </p> <p>\"I don't think the European arrest warrant was designed to be used in this sort of case and there are good legal grounds under Article 4 of the European arrest warrant whereby we could actually refuse to participate in this. </p> <p>\"I think it is a pretty dodgy case that the Germans are bringing, both in terms of German law and in terms of the reach of it, because in fact Dr Toben didn't actually commit this offence in Germany. </p> <p>\"If somebody goes too far and incites violence or causes an attack on somebody else, then it is absolutely right they should be prosecuted, but there is a very clear distinction from something you hold as an opinion - it may be wrong and you may completely disagree with it, and I do in this case... I think we have to hold that fundamental belief in freedom of speech.\" </p> <p>In his court appearance earlier this week, German-born Toben, 64, claimed he was the victim of a \"legal ambush\". </p> <p>\"It's not British law where the individual still has freedoms,\" he told the court. \"It's a witch-trial mentality in Germany concerning this matter... Britain has not the Holocaust denier laws that Germany has. I beg you to let me leave the country, to kick me out, I promise never to return.\"</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Manchester United could be eight points off the pace by the end of the weekend should they lose this one. And seeing they've only won once at Ewood Park in their last eight visits, that's not beyond the realms of possibility.</strong> Still, United fans can take heart: you're hardly struggling like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/match/3068040\">Bayern Munich</a>, and us making a big song and dance over your slightly lethargic start should ensure you being 4-0 up by half time.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Blackburn Rovers:</strong> Brown, Ooijer, Samba, Nelsen, Olsson, Emerton, Kerimoglu, Warnock, Pedersen, Derbyshire, Roque Santa Cruz.<br>Subs: Bunn, Mokoena, Andrews, Villanueva, Fowler, Treacy, Roberts.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Fletcher, Anderson, Giggs, Berbatov, Rooney.<br>Subs: Amos, Park, Nani, Rafael Da Silva, O'Shea, Evans, Tevez.</p> <p><strong>Funny flower, collapsing car, lots of handkerchiefs tied together coming out of a top hat, etc:</strong> Steve Bennett (Kent).</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Kick off, by the way, is at:</strong> 5.30pm. It's raining. The nights are fair drawing in. And there's quite a nip in the air.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Setanta professionalism:</strong> Steve McManaman has just been giving his opinion, presumably about this match, though I can't be sure, I wasn't paying attention. That hardly makes me unique: when the camera cut back to anchorman Angus Scott, he appeared to be checking his mobile phone for text messages! Can you not even pretend to be interested, man?!? You wouldn't catch Richard Keys fiddling around with his Nokia on Sky while Andy Gray ballses on. Though in fairness he won't want to be drawing attention to his hands.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Weather update:</strong> It is now absolutely <em>thrashing</em> it down.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> There's an ostentatiously friendly pre-match handshake between Paul Ince and Sir Alex Ferguson, and the ball is set rolling. \"In today's Guardian, the Premier League's first British black manager claims that, the last time they met, the Premier League's first British red-and-purple manager <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/04/premierleague.blackburn\">'drank all [his] red wine'</a>,\" writes Mac Millings. \"He doesn't just mean 'all' as in 'the whole bottle', does he?\" Yes, Mac. Our lawyers would like to point out that yes, yes he does.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>45 secs:</strong> Warnock is down and looking none too clever, having slid in for a challenge on Brown and gone over on his knee. He's looking very shaky and might not continue. Also suffering from pain thanks to Manchester United is Gary Naylor. \"It's not just the marketing machine that sells Manchester United shirts nationwide,\" he writes. \"My seven-year-old has just refused to wear an Everton top to play football with his friends because, 'they'll all laugh at me'. If he was wearing a Newcastle top, the parents would too.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Ronaldo tears down the left and lays the ball off to Berbatov, whose attempt at a return pass is insouciance crystallised. It is also a textbook example of uselessness. As Samba spirits the ball away, Ronaldo stands around waving his arms in semaphore shapes.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Warnock is back on but currently doing his level best not to get involved in the action. Tugay is, as a result, running around like a lunactic, making sliding challenges hither and yon. He's running that injury off, let's give him the benefit of the doubt.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> That should have been 1-0 to United. Ooijer concedes a corner out on the United left after pipping Ronaldo to a through ball. Rooney whips in a low, hard corner which should be cleared by two Blackburn shirts but isn't, and Vidic misses the ball from four yards with a clumsy lunge. If he'd gone in with his head rather than poking out a boot, he would surely have scored.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Santa Cruz latches onto a huge up-and-under, hangs around for a bit, then rolls it out left to Pedersen. The resulting cross is deep and harmless, though if Rovers had committed some men forward it could have caused some trouble, as Van der Sar was never getting to it. As it is, the keeper can scuttle off after the ball and tidy up.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Blackburn win a corner after some good work by Santa Cruz down the left. Emerton swings one in to the far post, but Van der Sar is adjudged to have been impeded and the danger is gone. A reasonably lively end-to-end start, here.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> From the sublime to the ridiculous from Pedersen there: he starts off a wonderful flowing move with an exquisite chipped pass from the left wing inside to Derbyshire, then ends it seconds later when he receives the return and passes the ball out of play in the most needless fashion imaginable.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> That should have been the opener for Blackburn. Emerton slides a fantastic ball down the inside right channel into the box, springing Derbyshire free. His shot across the keeper towards the bottom-left corner is saved by Van der Sar, but only pushed out towards the penalty spot. With the keeper prone, Santa Cruz rushes in to slam the ball home, but Ferdinand gets there first, sliding across the turf and hooking clear. This game really should be 1-1.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Blackburn are definitely enjoying the better of this. Santa Cruz and Pedersen link well down the left before losing the ball. Rooney takes up play but almost immediately concedes possession, allowing first Warnock and then Derbyshire half-chances to shoot for goal. Both times United make the crucial block, but how long United can hold out playing like this is open to question.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Now it's United's turn to squander a glorious opportunity. Fletcher is this time the culprit, cutting in from the left to get on the end of a beautifully weighted pass by Berbatov which springs the Blackburn back line and sees the midfielder bearing down on goal. But he drags his shot wide right of goal. That was an awful miss.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Emerton has a dig from 25 yards out, very centrally. It's always going wide left of goal, and in any case Van der Sar has it covered.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Ronaldo releases Giggs down the left but there's nobody other than Rooney to get on the end of the cross he sends into the centre, and he's being superbly marshalled by Samba and Nelsen. Meanwhile someone called Shaun writes in \"from a sickeningly balmy Spain. One thing intrigues me about Paul Ince not having his Uefa coaching 'badges'. What do these look like? I mean, are they sew-on or small and shiny with a safety pin? And shouldn't managers have to wear them, just so we can sure?\" They could also be shiny and made of foil with sticky backs, like the club ones from Panini Football 81.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Pedersen gives the ball away on the edge of his own area, allowing United to showcase some Arsenalesque skills. Instead of shooting the ball into the net, Rooney, Giggs, Ronaldo and Berbatov all take turns to attempt to walk it into the net. The bedlam looks impressive but there was no way they were getting past all the Blackburn defenders there.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>31 min: GOAL!!! Blackburn 0-1 Manchester United.</strong> Jason Brown in the Blackburn goal makes a spectacular flying save from Giggs, who shoots from the left, just inside the area, but sees his shot fingertipped adroitly over the bar. That's where the young keeper's luck runs out, though, as he comes for the resulting corner, doesn't get there, and his namesake Wes heads home from three yards into an empty net. However there's no little controversy, Vidic going up with Brown, putting his right arm across the keeper and skittling him over. You usually see those decisions given in favour of the keeper, so Blackburn are within their rights to be totally radged off there.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Another wonderful save from Brown, who comes out to close down the free Rooney, sticking up an arm and parrying the striker's clever dink. That should have been 2-0, so credit to the keeper there. Meanwhile Louise Smith has had enough of watching United and has gone into meltdown: \"C-Ron has a face like a smacked arse again, now he's playing next to Berbatov it's like watching the cast of EastEnders for sheer mardiness. Has there ever been a sulkier bunch of multi-millionaires being asked to do what they love for 90 minutes a week?\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> This is suddenly all United. Blackburn look a bit shellshocked, and this after being the better side for the first half hour. You can't really blame them, as it's not often you see keepers being bowled over without the whistle going. Might be an idea to try to see this one out to half time, when they can regroup. \"Your photos say it all,\" writes Justin Kavanagh, placing a wee bit too much importance on our Will-This-Do approach to Photoshop. \"While other managers get silly shirts printed up, Ferguson, the great method manager of our time, slowly takes on his club's demonic red hue, while turning others' wine into water.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Santa Cruz has a lunge at a deep cross from the right wing from Emerton, but Ferdinand eases him out of the road and the ball flies harmlessly through the box and away to safety. Blackburn are suddenly impotent, United increasingly impressive.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Rooney and Ronaldo exchange a couple of one-twos as the work the ball from the centre of the park, in front of the Rovers box, out right. Brown cuts inside and whips in a cross which Rooney meets at the near post - but he heads well wide.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Blackburn Rovers 0-1 Manchester United.</strong> Evra ends the half by breaking free down the left and pulling a ball back from the byline to Ronaldo, six yards out. He should score, but doesn't, stubbing his effort wide. And with that the whistle. Ince and Pedersen both approach referee Steve Bennett demanding answers, and no wonder: Vidic edged out Jason Brown for sure.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Blackburn took an age to come out, keeping United waiting in the torrential rain. Eventually everyone arrives; it's as we were during the first half, as no substitutions have been made. Immediately, Warnock drives forward straight down the centre, exchanges passes with Santa Cruz, then sends the striker free in the area. The ball sends him out wide left but he gets a decent shot in, forcing Van der Sar to parry the ball round his post. The corner is wasted, but that's better from Blackburn already.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Not for the first time in the match, Ooijer blocks Ronaldo off with a shoulder. The winger writhes around on the floor like his brain is about to ooze out of every facial aperture, stops grimacing for a bit to argue with Tugay, who suggests he should get up, then starts clutching his head again just as the ref comes across. There's to be no yellow for Ooijer, though, which is just as well as little contact had been made. Expect this to run and run.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Vidic purls a lovely ball straight down the centre. If Ronaldo had controlled the ball, he'd have been free one on one with Jason Brown. But he isn't able to bring it down and a decent chance is gone.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Santa Cruz, who looks to have a hamstring injury, hobbles off and is replaced by Roberts.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Ronaldo cuts inside from the left, works a second's worth of space to get a shot in, but can only hammer it straight at Nelsen from the edge of the area. Blackburn can't get the ball at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Emerton releases Derbyshire down the right. He's got plenty of time to get in a decent cross, but the ball that's sent across is worse than hopeless, sailing over the entire box and bouncing harmlessly away.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> This is all United, though they aren't making much of their possession.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Ronaldo takes down a spectacular crossfield pass from Anderson. He hares towards the Rovers box but is hauled back by the referee, who claims handball. That's another ridiculous decision: Ronaldo took that down fantastically well with his chest. Pedersen is replaced by Keith Treacy.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Blackburn just can't get the ball at all.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Sod this, there's nothing happening at all. Here, does anybody remember the Everton replica strip travails of a certain young Mr Naylor? \"If Gary Naylor's 7-year-old (I'm assuming grandchild) is embarrassed at wearing an Everton shirt (45 sec),\" begins Mac Millings, clearly in the mood to fling around delicious insults, \"then perhaps Grandpa Nayls should let the kid have that Cahill shirt he's been asking for, rather than forcing him to choose between the first-edition Dixie Dean heavy-knit, rain-soaked sweater and the tight 'n' tiny Andy Gray 80s nightclub vest.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>63 min: GOAL!!! Blackburn Rovers 0-2 Manchester United.</strong> Something's happened now. And it was so simple, but perfectly executed. Ronaldo draws Olsson out right, edges a pass from Brown past him and sprints clear. He immediately whips a cross into the centre for Rooney, who is standing on the spot and hooks a wonderful first-time effort into the top-left corner of the net. This is over.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Giggs takes his leave, to be replaced by Tevez.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Dear Lord, it is tipping down. This is biblical. United win a corner, Brown takes another header at goal, but the effort is nowhere near on target.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Tugay is replaced by Keith Andrews.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> A terrible square pass in front of the Rovers area by Rooney allows Treacy to tear down the left at speed. He's eventually upended by Fletcher, who is rightly booked for his trouble. There was no need to lunge in, either, because Treacy had no support.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> O'Shea comes on for Evra. Blackburn waste their free kick. Rooney chases after a long ball up the other end and scoops it over the advancing Brown - but his effort is too well cooked and lands on the roof of the net.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Blackburn have fallen to bits at the back. A pathetically poor Samba backpass is latched onto by Berbatov. He surely should round the keeper and score, but Jason Brown is out speedily and manages to smother at his feet. A wonderful save.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Nelsen goes up for a cross in the Rovers area. Rooney is convinced it hit his hand and goes haring after the referee. He's getting nothing, which is just, as Nelsen chested it down though it momentarily brushed the top of his sleeve afterwards. That would have been a very harsh penalty.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Anderson bursts skilfully down the inside-right channel and unleashes a wonderful shot which is first deflected then pushed wide of the right-hand post by Jason Brown, who has been excellent tonight. Rooney goes off for the oncoming Park. The corner is a complete waste of time.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> It would make for an interesting final few minutes should Rovers score, but I can't see it. Roberts, Emerton and Warnock stream forward: there are options down the right but the ball is witlessly shanked out of play.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Emerton has a shot from just outside the area. It's blocked but spoons up in the air. Any chance of applying pressure is immediately eschewed by Roberts, who instead of challenging Vidic for the ball elects to shove his opponent in the back in the most obvious of manners.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Ronaldo has a dig from just outside the Rovers box, but he drags his shot well wide left.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Three on two, Tevez has an easy chance to spring Ronaldo free on goal 40 yards out, but he holds on to the ball too long, then tries to feed Berbatov instead. The ball is way to heavy and mopped up by Blackburn with ease. That was very poor football.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Samba is booked for a lunge on Tevez. It was mistimed, not malicious, but a nailed-on booking.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Tevez hits the base of the right-hand post. This ceased to be a contest the minute the first goal went in.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> From a corner on the right, Samba meets an Edwards cross. It's half a chance but his powerful effort is miles over the bar and wide.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Warnock swings a cross from the left. Derbyshire meets it with his head six yards out, but flicks his header over the bar. And he was offside. There are going to be three more minutes of this.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Blackburn Rovers 0-2 Manchester United.</strong> Roberts has a chance to sprint clear but the ball is held up on the by-now-waterlogged pitch; Vidic clears up. Then Treacy has a potshot but it's dragged wide. And then the referee blows his whistle. It's all over. United definitely deserved their win - they dominated proceedings - but would Blackburn, decent until the opener, have kept it up had Steve Bennett ruled out Wes Brown's goal, as he should have? Probably not, now I come to think about it, no.</p>",
  "<p>Wow, no one saw that coming. Peter Mandelson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/mandelson.gordonbrown\">is back for the third time</a>, but is it third time lucky? </p> <p>This is an audacious move, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/gordonbrown.mandelson\">will receive a mixed reaction</a> in the Labour party. The left and centre left will groan; the ultras will revel in his return. You may not like the man's politics, but this is a decisive politician \u2013 his ruthless effectiveness cannot be denied, something said to be lacking and much needed if Labour is to thwart Cameron and his crew.</p> <p>The media will delight in the return of a big gun to the political field, but my guess is that the response of Jo Public will be \"So what, I'm paying an extra tenner at the pump, the cost of my weekly shop has shot through the roof and I'm worried for my job, so what you gonna do?\"</p> <p>Inevitably, a reshuffle focuses on the personalities and the players, but it's the policies that matter and which will determine whether Labour scores and wins that much talked about fourth term. If the homecoming of Britain's EU commissioner represents a throwback to a tired, rusty, old formula designed to win votes in a bygone era, then the game is over; it is lost. But if this reshuffle represents a return in temperament to the bold, assured, pre October 2007 Brown of times past \u2013 the one who talked about the need to move on from Blairism \u2013 then the game is on.</p> <p>One person who has been forthright in arguing the case for a change of approach is Labour backbencher, Jon Cruddas, the former deputy leadership candidate and this year's conference darling. There <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/labour.reshuffle\">was much speculation</a> that he might be offered a post, but, regardless of whether any offer was forthcoming, Cruddas had always made it clear that his priority was not personal advancement but the people of Dagenham \u2013 and beating the far right there, a political breed that has always fed on the fear that comes with economic uncertainty. (And, if truth be told, his entry into government would have probably required some policy revision.)</p> <p>The elevation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\">Ed Miliband</a>, from Cabinet fixer to bona fide secretary of state for Energy and Climate Change is significant. Unlike many of his political generation, Ed Miliband (like Cruddas) can give a speech and inspire. In many ways, he is far more impressive than his brother (as his own conference performance demonstrated) and he has grown in confidence. He has assiduously been going around the country canvassing opinion at a very local level on what should go into the next Labour manifesto, and has impressed with his openmindedness. But it's his politics that matter. </p> <p>It is common currency that this Miliband represents the social-democratic instincts of the PM. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/28/schools.labour\">his seminal Guardian piece on the Miliband family</a>, Andy Beckett noted that \"Ed was attracted to Brown's idea of using relatively small, highly technical but practical initiatives to redistribute wealth and reform the economy\" and his particular areas of responsibility when working for Brown at the Treasury were described as having a \"leftwing flavour\". Of course, Ed Miliband is no leftwinger and is more complicated than that description suggests. However, for those who believe in building a more equal, democratic and sustainable world, he is definitely on side. </p> <p>He has a growing base in the Labour party and now he has a department, so will he have the bottle to pick up the baton from where his brother left off and, say, push for personal carbon allowances? Will he strive to make the market work not only for social ends, but for the environment too? </p> <p>Who knows? Let's hope he grabs this opportunity to come out from behind his brother and beneath his master's shadow and become one of the big guns of a new political generation.</p>",

He said: \"The verdict was not a shock. We knew it going in, there was a lot of baggage. I don't like to use the word payback. I can tell you from the beginning my biggest concern was whether or not the jury would be able to separate their very strong feelings about Mr Simpson and judge him fairly and honestly.\" </p> <p>The former actor and National Football League (NFL) star was cleared of murdering his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman in a high-profile trial by a predominantly black jury in Los Angeles in 1995. </p> <p>The verdict divided America on racial lines and prompted debates over the suitability of televised court cases.</p> <p>In the latest trial, prosecutors said Simpson had taken a gang of men to the Palace Station to retrieve items he lost while trying to hide them from Goldman's family, which won $33.5m (\u00a318.9m) in damages from Simpson in a civil case.</p> <p>Four of the five men who accompanied Simpson to the casino - Charles Cashmore, Walter \"Goldie\" Alexander, Michael \"Spencer\" McClinton and Charles Ehrlich - accepted plea deals and agreed to testify for the prosecution.</p> <p>The fifth, Clarence \"CJ\" Stewart, 54, was Simpson's golfing friend and co-defendant in the trial.</p> <p>Galanter told the jury the prosecution had failed to prove his client was guilty and added that the case \"has taken on a life of its own because of Simpson's involvement\".</p> <p>\"Every co-operator, every person who had a gun, every person who had an ulterior motive, every person who signed a book deal, every person who got paid money - the police, the district attorney's office, is only interested in one thing: Simpson,\" Galanter said. \"He has always been the target of this investigation, and nothing else mattered.\"</p> <p>He told the jury that Simpson never intended to commit a robbery but wanted to reclaim personal mementoes of his career and family life which were being sold by the dealers Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley.</p> <p>\"Being stupid, and being frustrated, is not being a criminal,\" he said.</p> <p>Witnesses told the court Simpson repeatedly declared he had not seen any guns and did not know guns were to be present in the hotel room.</p> <p>Simpson did not give evidence during the three-week trial, and jurors were instructed not to consider that when judging the case.</p> <p>Judge Jackie Glass, who rejected several mistrial motions and kept a tight rein on the proceedings, warned the all-white jury against trying to punish Simpson over the death of his former wife.</p> <p>She told them if they hoped to become famous because of the trial \"then this is not the case for you\".</p> <p>Before the trial began, one prospective juror was dismissed after she told the court she \"felt (Simpson) got away with murder\".</p> <p>In 2006, Simpson wrote a book called If I Did It, which set out how he might have murdered his wife, had he been so inclined. The book was withdrawn and pulped by HarperCollins shortly before being published.</p> <p>In August last year, a Florida bankruptcy court gave the rights to the book to the Goldman family, who published it under the title I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.</p> <p>The former star and his almost-forgotten co-defendant Stewart were both found guilty of all 12 charges they faced. These were two charges of first degree kidnapping, two of armed robbery, two of assault with a deadly weapon, two of coercion with a deadly weapon, burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime, kidnapping and robbery.</p> <p>Simpson was refused bail pending sentencing in early December.</p>",
  "<p>Now that <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/03/news/economy/house_friday_bailout/?postversion=2008100317\">the bailout is law</a> and America is officially a socialist nation, it's time to return to the question of who's to blame for it all, so that whoever it is can be yelled at. Fox News Channel ranter-in-chief Bill O'Reilly believes the culprit is House financial services committee chair <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/barney_frank_ba.html\">Barney Frank</a>. (His argument is that Frank was instrumental in pushing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make more and more questionable loans, then ignored the growing crisis at the mortgage lenders.) On Thursday, the limelight-loving Frank agreed to appear on O'Reilly's show, where the following enormously shouty exchange ensued. Even by his own standards, O'Reilly is unhinged here, screaming at Frank that he's a \"coward\" who talks \"bull\", prompting the congressman -- whose TV appearances are rarely dull -- to offer some choice thoughts on the host's approach to broadcasting...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yrfPMa3lONU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yrfPMa3lONU&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/yrfPMa3lONU&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><br></p>"
