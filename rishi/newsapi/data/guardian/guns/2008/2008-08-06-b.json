  "<p><strong>12.34am</strong></p> <p>Back at the Guardian flat after the last show of the day: Paper Cinema's Night Flyer. \"It's all done with CGI,\" I overheard someone saying, with deep irony. In fact it is done with nothing but charm and incredible drawing skills. Paper Cinema is exquisite, cut-out illustrations held in front of a camera, the resultant images then projected on to a screen. A wonderful live score was performed by a chap playing the guitar and violin with equal and splendid skill. The show is low-tech and high-tech all at the same time. Enchanting.</p> <p>The end of a marathon day in the delightful Forest Fringe: can it revolutionise Edinburgh? Well, maybe that's putting it a bit strong. But the waywardness, the willingness to experiment, the imagination of this place is enormously attractive. Not everything I saw today was wildly successful, but everything was genuinely having a go at creating something different. The spirit of this place is terrific. The avant-garde lives on in Forest Fringe, and all power to it.</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong></p> <p>Back in the bar. Someone is playing tango on a wind-up gramophone. Very lovely. I have just seen <a href=\"http://www.tinnedfingers.co.uk/\">Tinned Fingers</a>' work-in-progress <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/Bybreakfastitwillbedryenoughfortennis/index.htm\">By Breakfast It Will Be Dry Enough For Tennis</a>, which had moments of magic. I loved that they warned you about the dangers of time travel when asking you to switch off your mobile phone - totally deadpan - before the show. It is a piece about rain, which is utterly appropriate for today, when it hasn't stopped, in a frankly quite charmless way. There were some very beautiful moments with projected images on umbrellas. And an inverted umbrella full of water, dangling over the head of one of the perfomers like a watery sword of Damocles.</p> <p>Andy Field, one of the programmers of Forest Fringe, pointed out that the pot-of-paint disaster in Action Hero actually turned out to be a positive thing - introducing an element of danger and uncertainty, and really making the audience start to gun for the daredevil artist as he attempts to make it across the canyon on a tightrope (or in this case, over a small ramp on a bicycle).</p> <p>Oh and I bumped into Maddy Costa, very famous today because she was on the front of the Guardian holding a ukelele. She also really enjoyed the Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller show at the <a href=\"http://www.fruitmarket.co.uk/\">Fruitmarket Gallery</a>, so that means it really is good, it's not just me.</p> <p>Soon heading into the final show of the evening - the one I have been looking forward to most - <a href=\"http://www.thepapercinema.com/\">The Paper Cinema</a>'s show Night Flyer.</p> <p><strong>5.50pm</strong></p> <p>Well, it wouldn't be experimental without something going wrong, would it? Action Hero's show <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/WatchMeFall/index.htm\">Watch Me Fall</a> just involved a slight catastrophe involving the spillage of a large pot of paint that was being used to weigh down a prop. I also had some Coke spat at me, but that was part of the show - an intriguing little number exploring the nature of daredevil acts.</p> <p>Back downstairs in the cafe, people are singing now.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong></p> <p>First of all, the place. Forest Fringe is in a lovely, slightly beaten-up Victorian red-brick building, all dilapidated grandeur, which is leased to a group of Edinburgh artists. On the ground floor, you can get your hair cut plus a glass of vodka for a tenner. (\"A snip and a sip.\") There's the nice lady who will give you your ticket sitting in the hallway; and there's the cafe, where it's soup and bread on chipped charity-shop plates served by volunteers. I love it already.</p> <p>And I've just come from my first show upstairs in the main hall that Forest Fringe is occupying: an utterly disconcerting, extremely intimate, sometimes funny and oddly tender piece of performance art that seemed to look at the actor's role as a creator of pity and fear; and what it means to be in an audience, colluding in the illusion. I'm not going to tell you more about <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/InState/index.htm\">In State</a> because that ruin it, part of its power being in its unexpectedness. But I can tell you that at the beginning of the performance <a href=\"http://www.mapping4d.clara.net/\">Lucy Ellinson</a> says: \"There are two certainties in this show. One, there will be some audience participation. And two, I am going to die.\" It's on again tomorrow at 1pm - see it if you can, but be aware it's for only 10 or so audience members, so try to turn up to get a ticket in advance.</p> <p>There's a great atmosphere to this place. It's friendly, it has a relaxed, improvisatory feel, you genuinely feel like you are getting away from the over-commercialised mainstream and might be shown something different. In short, it feels like a fringe surely ought to feel.</p> <p><strong>12.30pm</strong></p> <p>This morning I perused the Arts Council's astonishingly self-congratulatory <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/downloads/review08.pdf\">annual report</a>. (Actually, I am exempting chief executive Alan Davey from that - at least his section was tinged with humility - in contrast to Christopher Frayling's.) Page 51 is particularly gripping: the salaries of the directors of ACE. The head of advocacy and communications gets \u00a3130,000 per year; the director of arts planning and investment, \u00a3152,000. Wow, let's all go and work for the Arts Council, I briefly said to myself. Then I thought not.</p> <p>Anyway, enough of that. Today I am off to <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/\">Forest Fringe</a>, the new free or pay-what-you-can venue that is so fringe it's not even in the fringe programme. <a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/\">BAC</a> is doing scratch performances there (though not today) and there are lots of other treats in the offing, including Paper Cinema, which apparently is what it sounds: \"cinema\" created with an Anglepoise lamp and some props. I'll be blogging as I go, so keep an eye out for how the afternoon unfolds at the venue that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/14/edinburghfestival.fringetheatre1\">Lyn Gardner</a> predicts may \"dramatically change the face of the fringe\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Armani Knowles better</strong></p> <p>It never hurts to be related to a megastar. Or so we've heard. For lo, Beyonce Knowles's little sister Solange has been snapped up by Giorgio Armani to model his latest denim range. Solange will be what the designers like to call an ambassador for the brand. Alas, this post does not come with UN entry card and diplomatic immunity - she just gets to wear some Armani jeans during her current press tour. Apparently she's not just a sibling, but an actress and singer too. </p> <p><strong>Slip us a diamond, please?</strong></p> <p>Those who might be fretting that the theatrical revival of <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/calendar/productions/the-wizard-of-oz-39120\">The Wizard of Oz</a> at the Royal Festival Hall just might not be kitsch enough, feel at ease. Swarovski, who apparently were makers of the original ruby slippers (we thought it was a witch?) have made a new pair for the show. In fact the production will be dripping in Swarovski bling, so we recommend you take along your oh-so-fashionable Wayfarers. </p> <p><strong>Forget G8, Surya is the place to be</strong></p> <p>Ethical fashionistas, here's a date for your non-leather diaries: next Tuesday, August 12, there's an eco-fashion party at the Surya in King's Cross.

The glossy magazines are touting it as one of the hottest trends for autumn/winter. All very well on a ball dress, but really, is the Victorian fancy trims effect workable for mere mortals? We think we run the risk of looking like Miss Havisham.</p> <p><strong>I like her tight sweater</strong></p> <p>Move over SJP - Roisin Murphy could be the new style icon for our times. After getting through at least ten outfit changes at Glastonbury, the ex-Moloko singer was seen donning on-trend purple headwear at Global Gathering. Indeed, Tilda Swinton's kookiest Brit fashion crown is facing a serious challenge. No stranger to avant-garde couture, she donned Gareth Pugh in her Overpowered video, and with the outrageous pompom shock-frock that graced her album cover, she's even giving Bjork a run for her money.</p> <p><strong>Paris versus Fergie</strong></p> <p>Over the pond, it's celebrity shoe wars: whose A-list-branded slipper will take out the eye of rival designer wannabes quickest?

  "<p>Most tennis games give you precise control, but over a very limited number of shots. As a result, the more you play, the more unrealistic they seem. Top Spin 3 reverses this with a new way of hitting the ball that's more akin to golf than tennis games. First you move to the shot, then you hold down the stroke button before releasing to determine strength and angle. The end result is a near-infinite number of strokes, over which you sometimes have no control at all. It's a pity, because Top Spin 3 looks amazing, with fluid animations, 43 stadia and convincing player likenesses. If only winning rallies weren't a matter of luck as much as skill.</p>",
  "<p>Europe should consider sharing vast amounts of intelligence and information on its citizens with the US to establish a \"Euro-Atlantic area of cooperation\" to combat terrorism, according to a high-level confidential report on future security.</p> <p>The 27 members of the EU should also pool intelligence on terrorism, develop joint video-surveillance and unmanned drone aircraft, start networks of anti-terrorism centres, and boost the role and powers of an intelligence-coordinating body in Brussels, said senior officials.</p> <p>The 53-page report drafted by the Future Group of interior and justice ministers from six EU member states - Germany, France, Sweden, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic -argues Europe will need to integrate much of its policing, intelligence-gathering, and policy-making if it is to tackle terrorism, organised crime, and legal and illegal immigration.</p> <p>The report, seen by the Guardian, was submitted to EU governments last month following 18 months of work. The group, which also includes senior officials from the European Commission, was established by Germany last year and charged with drafting a blueprint for security and justice policy over the next five years.</p> <p>Baroness Scotland, the UK attorney general, had observer status with the group to assess the implications for Britain, whose legal system, unlike continental Europe, is based on the common law.</p> <p>The group's controversial proposals are certain to trigger major disputes, not least its calls for Europe to create an expeditionary corps of armed gendarmerie for paramilitary intervention overseas.</p> <p>The report said the EU would fail to beat terrorism unless it developed a full partnership with Washington, a process currently pushing ahead in fits and starts.</p> <p>\"The EU should make up its mind with regard to the political objective of achieving a Euro-Atlantic area of cooperation with the United States in the field of freedom, security and justice,\" it said.</p> <p>Such a pact, which should be finalised by 2014 at the latest, would entail the transfer of vast volumes of information on European citizens and travellers to the US authorities. Negotiations have long been under way to agree such a pact, but have been bedevilled by divergences in privacy law and data protection regimes.</p> <p>The US is already demanding that EU countries sign up for a battery of security measures on transatlantic flights and the supply of personal information on passengers if they are to enjoy visa-free travel to the US. Under one such accord struck in March between Washington and Berlin, the Germans are to make DNA and biometric information on travellers available.</p> <p>The European Commission and the US homeland security department are also trying to iron out discrepancies in privacy laws to allow the wholesale exchange of data. The aim is to reach a binding international agreement this year or next.</p> <p>Last month the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to MEPs pressing Brussels to reject US pressure because the US is \"a country that, in privacy terms, is all but lawless ... US privacy laws are weak. They offer little protection to citizens and virtually none to non-citizens.\"</p> <p>While urging a comprehensive transatlantic electronic pact, the Future Group focuses mainly on boosting police cooperation and integration between EU states, policies which would reinforce the powers of European agencies and institutions bearing acronyms such as Europol, Eurojust, Frontex, and Sitcen and perhaps see new agencies established to deal with security and intelligence operations.</p> <p>Several member states, not least Britain, will have deep qualms about the proposals, with the British likely to balk at automatic pooling of national intelligence.</p> <p>Anti-terrorist campaigns can only be effective if \"maximum information flow between [EU] member states is guaranteed,\" the report said. \"Relevant security-related information should be available to all security authorities in the member states.\" It said \"networks of anti-terrorist centres\" was a possible solution.</p> <p>While cooperation between national police forces in the EU was advancing, the report conceded that the sharing of espionage and intelligence material was a \"considerable challenge\" as it clashed with the \"principle of confidentiality\" that is the basis for successful exchanges.</p> <p>The report calls for a bigger role for \"Sitcen\" in coordinating intelligence sharing. Sitcen, or the Joint Situation Centre, is a shadowy intelligence body based in Brussels which started as a foreign policy tool supplying analysis on international crises to Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, but which now focuses on counter-terrorism and internal security policy.</p> <h2>Key points</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> National police forces to cooperate and integrate</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Improve European-level crisis management</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Need to harness the talents of \"different actors\" in fighting terrorism</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> National security services and intelligence agencies need to collaborate much more closely</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> New EU internet-based propaganda campaign to defeat radicalisation and terrorist recruitment</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Create \"European Gendarmerie Force\" for deployment and intervention abroad.

  "<p>A man was yesterday found guilty of killing three men with a machine gun in a gangland execution. </p> <p>Miran Thakrar, 24, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of the murders of Keith Cowell, 52, his son Matthew Cowell, 17, and friend Tony Dulieu, 33. The three men were killed with a Mac 10 sub-machine gun at a house in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, in August last year. </p> <p>Thakrar is also accused of the attempted murders of two women in the house, for which he awaits a verdict. </p> <p>His brother Kevan Thakrar, 21, from Stevenage, denies three counts of murder and two attempted murders.

His mother, Christine, and Matthew Cowell's girlfriend, Clare Evans, both of who were in the house, were stabbed. </p> <p>Jennings told the jury that Miran Thakrar had threatened to kill them only weeks before over a previous drugs deal. </p> <p>Explaining what happened on the day of the murders, he said that he was in the kitchen when Miran came into the lounge where Keith and Matthew Cowell, Dulieu and Christine Jennings were. Evans was upstairs watching television with her three-year-old child. </p> <p>Miran, holding the gun, told everyone to \"get down on the floor\".

  "<p>In 1969, during the cold war, Nicol Peacock, who has died of cancer aged 77, led a team of five British scientists to the Kurchatov Nuclear Fusion Institute in Moscow to probe a controversial Soviet claim. Intricate dealings and manoeuvres had preceded this mission. Soviet assertions about the high performance of their nuclear fusion experiments, which used the \"tokamak\" concept, had been presented at an international conference in Novosibirsk in 1968 - and had been treated with scepticism by western scientists. Control of this process is of utmost importance, as it promises endless amounts of energy without the release of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>The tokamak uses a toroidal-shaped magnetic chamber in which a hot plasma is confined, to produce fusion energy. The term originated with a Russian acronym for a \"toroidal chamber with magnetic coils\". The concept replicates the fusion of hydrogen atoms, which releases the energy that powers the sun and stars. </p> <p>Peacock and his team confirmed the Soviet claims by measuring the plasma temperature with a laser beam, using novel techniques. The news had an astonishing impact on the scientific community in the west and represented the biggest advance yet in fusion research. The tokamak was soon adopted as the main line of research, as it continues to be today.</p> <p>For Peacock, the Moscow mission was the high point in his career, as upon his return to Britain he was invited to present the results to an astonished audience at the American Physical Society Conference in Los Angeles in November 1969. He went on to confirm his international reputation as a nuclear fusion scientist. With his death Britain has lost one of its leading figures in the science of measurement techniques in fusion energy research.</p> <p>Peacock was born in the small town of Darvel, east of Kilmarnock, the son of a marine-engine fitter and a lace weaver. He was educated at the local Mair's school, Darvel junior secondary school and Kilmarnock academy. He obtained his first degree in physics at Glasgow University, his tutor being Sir Sam Curran, who later became chief scientist at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) laboratory at Aldermaston, Berkshire. Peacock obtained his PhD from Liverpool University and was subsequently awarded a DEng degree.</p> <p>In 1956 Peacock was hired by Curran to work at Aldermaston, where a nuclear-fusion research programme had recently started. Peacock entered this programme full of enthusiasm and developed measurement techniques in ultraviolet and x-ray spectroscopy. </p> <p>In 1964 Peacock was awarded a Robert Blair fellowship, which enabled him to spend the next two years at what is now the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. There he worked with Jim Tuck, a member of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project, who had remained at Los Alamos and had become interested in thermonuclear fusion.</p> <p>In 1965 Peacock returned to work at the newly established Culham Laboratory in Oxfordshire, dedicated to thermonuclear fusion research. At Culham, Peacock established a large group within one of the two experimental divisions. His ability to attack any physics problem and get to the bottom of it paid off: the laboratory directors gave him an unparalleled degree of freedom to work on diverse, but relevant, problems in fusion research. During the ensuing years, measurement techniques were developed with the assistance of colleagues and British PhD students.</p> <p>Among the projects Peacock worked on at Culham was the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak, the largest in the world. In France the large ITER international tokamak - the successor to JET - is currently being built. Although it will not generate energy on to the grid, it should prove that fusion can work. It has a power output of 500 megawatts, as opposed to JET's 16 megawatts, and will hopefully be followed by the first commercial fusion power plant.</p> <p>During the years from the 1970s until his retirement in 1996, Peacock published more than 100 scientific papers with colleagues and PhD students as co-authors. Several awards followed: the Civil Service merit appointment (1974); a research fellowship in the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (1985); an honorary professorship at Queen's University Belfast (1994); and the chairmanship of the International Subcommittee on Atomic and Molecular Data for Fusion. </p> <p>After retiring, Peacock remained passionate about his work and was a frequent visitor to Culham. He will be remembered not only for that famous mission to Moscow, but also for his achievements at Aldermaston and Culham. </p> <p>Peacock leaves his wife Maureen and two daughters, Fiona and Lindsay. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nicol Jamieson Peacock, scientist, born February 7 1931; died July 19 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 15 2008. In the article above we said that Jim Tuck was the wartime director of the British delegation to the Manhattan project. We're informed that, though a member of that delegation, he was not its director. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It was John Gilmore, founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who said that the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it. For years, the Chinese authorities have done their best to prove him wrong. Now, with the Beijing Olympics upon us, a group of hackers has launched an attempt to stamp out censorship there - and they want your help to do it.</p> <p>This week the Chaos Computer Club, a German-based hacking group, used its website, ccc.de, to launch a toolkit designed to help journalists reporting from the Olympics to get uncensored access to western websites. The toolkit will be made available to journalists on a USB key that the CCC is calling the Freedom Stick.<br><strong><br>Closed doors</strong></p> <p>The Chinese authorities have censored access to western sites from within the country for years, but in the run-up to the games, the issue has become increasingly problematic - and public. The authorities have been sputtering towards the idea of an open internet, first declaring that journalists could access previously filtered western sites, and then reneging on the idea at the 11th hour. According to the Open Net Initiative (<a href=\"http://www.opennet.net\">opennet.net</a>), which monitors state surveillance and filtering online, the Chinese government has now opened access for the media to many sites, but it is still using techniques to stop access to sites when users search on certain keywords. What is not clear is whether everyone in China has access to the sites that have been opened, nor whether they will remain available after the games are over.</p> <p>CCC's downloadable toolkit contains software that provides access to Tor, a network of computers designed to make internet traffic anonymous. Tor consists of volunteer computers that relay traffic between each other without knowing its ultimate source or destination. It makes it difficult for observers to track where internet traffic is going, or who sent it. </p> <p>Tor isn't new. It was originally based on technology developed by the US navy. But it is appropriate for the job, says Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sponsored the development of the network until 2005. \"Tor lets you see what the world looks like from someone else's net connection,\" he says.</p> <p>It isn't foolproof though, points out Johannes Ullrich, chief research officer at the SANs Institute, an online security research and training centre. \"Observers could look at the Tor server's end-to-end exit points. You have to connect to Tor, and it downloads a list of the possible Tor nodes that you could connect to,\" he says. If the Chinese find the Tor nodes that people are connecting to, or the servers that provide the list of public nodes, they could block those, too.<br><strong><br>Bridge over troubled internet</strong></p> <p>But the CCC hoped to have an answer for that this week, involving computer users against censorship based outside China. Last year, the creators of Tor developed a system of bridges, another kind of node operated by volunteers that pass traffic between other users and the Tor network. \"Tor is getting really tricky for the Chinese to stop, because getting a list of all the bridges is almost impossible,\" says Frank Rieger, who sits on the Tor board and is also involved with the CCC.</p> <p>The more people that operate bridges around the world, the harder it will be for the Chinese to block Tor. There's <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en\">a guide</a> to operating a Tor node. And the more Tor nodes there are, the better the network's performance will be. \"So our wish is that people out there who can spare the bandwidth for open exit and middle nodes will contribute. It's not something that we can entirely do alone,\" explains Michael Horn, a networking expert who volunteers for the CCC.</p> <p>Access to websites for journalists visiting China shouldn't be that difficult. Rieger explains that some news agencies are already setting up proxy servers - private computers located outside China, which journalists can connect to using an encrypted link. These computers then act as a hopping-off point on to the public internet, giving the journalists unfettered net access. But the journalists have to keep the addresses of these servers quiet in case the Chinese authorities block access to them.</p> <p><strong>Raising awareness</strong></p> <p>Jonathan Zittrain, professor of law at Harvard and a chief investigator for the Open Net Initiative, argues that journalists visiting China aren't really the issue. News organisations outside the so-called Great Firewall of China should be trying harder to get their news through to the wider Chinese public rather than getting it to a few privileged reporters. \"When those organisations put out their news, what effort are they taking to ensure that other people in China could get access to it?\" he asks.</p> <p>News agencies have lots of options, including mirrored websites, Torconnected servers, having news articles converted to computerised speech and read over a Skype channel, and even producing a digest of the daily news that could be distributed on BitTorrent. The US government's International Broadcasting Bureau has been using anti-censorship techniques for years to distribute the country's non-military international media, including the Voice of America, to countries whose governments would rather not have it. Other groups such as <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542\">Reporters Without Borders</a> are also heavily involved in promoting anti-censorship for news reporters.</p> <p>And that, ultimately, is the real battle. Visiting journalists are privileged players in China. They have the outside connections that they need to get unfiltered access. </p> <p>But the CCC's real goal is to raise awareness. It is trying to mount a broader assault against Chinese net censorship that will continue after the Olympics, as citizens there continue to use Tor and public proxy servers in larger numbers. This isn't a sprint to the finish - it's a long-distance race.</p>",
  "<p>After a crime spree that spanned 20 years and swaths of southern England, netted around \u00a380m and attracted the attention and efforts of five police forces, the gang behind the biggest single burglary in British history has been jailed. </p> <p>It seems unlikely that any of their victims or the detectives involved would have disagreed with the judge's observation as he passed sentence on five of its members: \"You are,\" said Judge Christopher Critchlow, \"a lawless group with no respect for people or the law.\"</p> <p>He did not need to add that they were also very good at what they did.</p> <p>Between 2003 and 2006 members of the 15-strong, \"forensically aware\" gang committed more than 100 separate crimes ranging from stealing antiques from stately homes to lifting thousands of pounds' worth of construction metals and knocking off cash machines.</p> <p>Their most lucrative haul, however, was taken from Ramsbury Manor, home of the reclusive property tycoon Harry Hyams, on February 1 2006. </p> <p>At 10.30 that night, the gang rolled through the grounds of the Wiltshire mansion in two stolen 4x4s. After tying metal poles to the front of a Subaru estate car and ramming their way through a window, they helped themselves to more than 300 museum-grade pieces including an 18th-century barometer and a 17th-century Dutch table clock valued at \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>By the time they drove off into the darkness after tripping the alarm on a silver cabinet, they were \u00a330m better off.</p> <p>As a consequence of the robbery, Hyams, the man who built Centre Point, one of London's best-known landmarks, fell 49 places in that year's Sunday Times Rich List.</p> <p>While almost half the items were recovered a few weeks later in an underground shelter, many had been badly damaged.</p> <p>Although the gang burgled 12 stately homes and antique shops between April 2005 and April 2006, the story behind their audacious, five-county crime wave can be told only now after Judge Critchlow lifted the reporting restrictions that had been put in place for legal reasons. </p> <p>Five members of the Johnson family, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, were found guilty of conspiracy to burgle and jailed for up to 11 years at Reading crown court in February. </p> <p>Ricky Johnson, 54, was jailed for eight years while his two sons, Chad Johnson, 33, and Albi Johnson, 26, were sentenced to 11 years and nine years respectively. </p> <p>Ricky's nephews, Danny O'Loughlin, 32, and Michael Nicholls, 29, were jailed for 11 years and 10 years. </p> <p>\"This must be one of the most serious cases of burglary ever to come before the court,\" said Judge Critchlow. \"Aggravating features include the burglaries being staged at night. They were at isolated homes and people were often at home. They were well planned and executed. </p> <p>\"They were sophisticated ... little has been recovered, no doubt hidden in the countryside or passed on for disposal.\" </p> <p>Last December Ricky Johnson, Chad Johnson and O'Loughlin were cleared of stealing snuff boxes worth \u00a35m from Waddesdon Manor, home of the Rothschild family, after Judge Critchlow ruled that some prosecution evidence could not be included. </p> <p>But at a trial at Bristol crown court at the end of last year 12 members of the gang, including Chad Johnson and O'Loughlin, were jailed for a total of 38 years for conspiracy to burgle or steal metals. </p> <p>The order banning reporting of the case was lifted yesterday after O'Loughlin pleaded guilty to a burglary in which a cash dispenser containing nearly \u00a355,000 was torn from the wall of a Co-op shop in Stanford in the Vale, Oxfordshire, on New Year's Day 2006. </p> <p>He was given a 66-month sentence for the burglary by Judge Critchlow sitting at Guildford crown court, to run concurrently with the jail term for the country house raids.</p> <p>Police had long suspected the involvement of the Irish-born travelling family, but the financial and geographical scale of the thefts was so immense that five forces - Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Thames Valley, Warwickshire and West Mercia - came together to pursue them in an investigation known as Operation Haul.</p> <p>The gang all had previous convictions for offences including burglary, deception and handling stolen goods. Chad Johnson was jailed for marrying an heiress twice his age, stealing her \u00a3250,000 inheritance and leaving her bankrupt.</p> <p>In October 2006 more than 100 officers carried out dawn raids on the Johnson clan and arrested 14 people.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Mark Warwick, from Thames Valley police, who led the joint investigation, said yesterday that the convictions and long sentences handed down spoke for themselves.</p> <p>He added: \"Most importantly, members of the public in the five police areas are now able to live without the fear of crime inflicted on them by this organised criminal network. </p> <p>\"In some cases the results of their gratuitous violence and threats inflicted on vulnerable people in their own homes has had an impact that the victims will never recover from. It is these people who have my utmost sympathy.\"</p> <p>News of the convictions will not represent the West Country family's first brush with the media. Three years ago the BBC broadcast a documentary called Summer with the Johnsons, which chronicled the clan's everyday life. The programme also offered the family a chance to defend itself against allegations it had been involved in the Waddesdon Manor burglary. </p> <p>In it Ricky Johnson admitted to \"an awful lot of robbing\" over the years, but denied burgling country homes and even offered to help the Rothschilds recover their stolen property.</p> <p>His words, though, contained more than a hint of defiance - and a caveat. </p> <p>\"I would like to make it clear to the people out there, to the police and the rich people like Lord Rothschild: if I feel the need when I have got to rob a stately home, I will do so ... I feel I have got the fucking right to rob the lords out there.\"</p> <h2>What they took</h2> <p><strong>June 10 2003 </strong> Waddesdon Manor, National Trust property and home of the Rothschild family near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

  "<p>Eric \"Digger\" Dowling, the English airman who helped excavate the tunnel but was left behind when the Great Escapers crawled out of Stalag Luft III and into history, has died peacefully a day short of his 93rd birthday.</p> <p>The escape from the German camp on March 24 1944, through tunnels dug with tools and equipment scavenged from scrap materials, has become one of the most famous in the annals of the second world war, and inspired an equally famous film, The Great Escape - which Dowling very much disliked.</p> <p>\"He couldn't understand why they hadn't made it more true to life,\" his son Peter said yesterday. \"He said some of the details were very accurate, the materials, how they did the tunnelling, the confined spaces - but they made up a lot of the plot and he didn't like that at all.\" One of the most celebrated scenes in the 1963 film, when Steve McQueen charges a barbed wire perimeter fence on his motor bike, was invented.</p> <p>Unlike some survivors, Eric Dowling spoke readily about his war and, though a modest man, became a local celebrity - but he kept a few secrets to his grave. It was only after his death last month in a nursing home near Bristol that Peter Dowling sorted through a lifetime's letters, diaries, photographs and memorabilia, and was horrified to find a German army revolver and several rounds of live ammunition.</p> <p>\"I phoned the police in Bristol, and they came round pretty promptly. They took the gun away to be decommissioned - but when they heard who it belonged to, they refused to charge the usual fee before they returned it to me.\"</p> <p>\"One of my great regrets now is that we didn't persuade my father to write a book: he had a fantastic memory until quite recently, and I found meticulous records he kept in the camp, including many photographs - I think they must have got hold of a German camera by barter - details of everyday life and lists of every wine he knew about that he planned to taste when he got out. He remembered life in the camp and relations with the Germans as pretty good. He was an excellent cricketer, which they organised by county, so he led for the Stalag III Somerset. He was devastated when Hitler had 50 of the recaptured prisoners murdered, including seven very good friends.\"</p> <p>Stalag Luft III, south-east of Berlin in what is now Poland, was intended for downed American and British airmen, but by 1943 usefully included former Polish mining engineers. The March 1944 escape was only one of many - the Germans kept a small museum of captured escape materials for training purposes. The prisoners, many trained as designers or engineers, forged passports, passes and identity papers, and made German uniform and insignia, civilian clothes, compasses and maps, and digging tools and ventilation shafts from powdered milk tins.</p> <p>The plan devised by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell was for the most elaborate escape of all, 250 prisoners through three long tunnels called Tom, Dick and Harry - with the entrance to Harry hidden under a hut stove. The first shallow tunnels collapsed in the sandy soil burying the diggers. They then dug deeper, shoring with the boards from bunks - survivors remembered sleeping on nets of ropes made of rags, because all the planks had gone. The telltale bright yellow soil dug out had to be hidden under the huts, or smuggled in trouser legs and shaken out into the garden plots.</p> <p>Dowling, born in Glastonbury, became an RAF navigator and flew 29 missions before his plane was shot down and he was captured: his son said his most traumatic memory was not the camp, but a training flight he missed which crashed with the loss of the entire crew. He survived the war with no worse than ear damage from the appalling noise in the cockpits, and returned happily to county cricket. He became a county bridge champion with his Norwegian wife Agnes Marie and spent 20 years working for British Aerospace in Bristol on the Concorde project. He moved into a retirement home in Nailsea five years ago: the owner renamed it Dowling House in his honour. His son hopes that his papers and memorabilia may find a place in a national museum.</p>",
  "<p>Cycling is a collection of habits and muscle memories, learned in childhood - usually with the help of stabilisers - that are never wholly forgotten. After all, we encourage people to revisit a long-neglected activity with the expression, \"It's just like riding a bike.\"</p> <p>For me, freewheeling has been second nature for as long as I have been riding. I have also always favoured a conventional multi-geared bicycle: it makes sense on downhills to click on to the smallest rear cog and blast along, and to choose a low gear for going up. Integral to this is the ability to glide along without pedalling.</p> <p>Why would anyone give up their gears and revert to the kind of primitive, one-speed-fits-all machine, used more than a century ago when the Tour de France wasn't even a gleam in the eye of its first director, Henri Desgrange? He resisted the use of variable gears, fearing it would detract from the heroic efforts of his racers, one of whom, Octave Lapize, branded race officials \"assassins\" after dragging himself and his gearless bike over the Pyrenees in 1910.</p> <p>Nowadays, cycling magazines are full of breathless reports on the latest electronic gear shifters. But there's a growing place, too, for single-speed bicycles, similar to those of the Desgrange era. Until recently, the sole preserve of city bike messengers, the single speed fixie and its anti-establishment style is spreading. </p> <p>Commercial models are mostly sold with a flip-flop rear wheel - and two brakes. On one side of the axle is a standard freewheel that still allows you to coast along: anathema to the hardcore fixie. On the flip side is the true solitary fixed sprocket whose movement is married to that of the wheel. </p> <p>A fixie is a relatively cheap proposition. Most pr\u00eat \u00e0 p\u00e9daler bikes sell for around \u00a3500. There is a growing range from the big manufacturers, including Specialized and Trek. Independent companies such as Pearson of Surrey, Condor and Surly have their own take on the affordable single-speed. If you're after maximum street cred - and have the mechanical know-how - you can take the DIY path, converting your existing bike into a fixie for \u00a3100-\u00a3200. </p> <p>Since the first rule of the fixie is \"Don't even think about freewheeling\", adapting to riding one is not easy. Try coasting downhill: you'll end up with your legs twisted into a reef knot. </p> <p>If you're worried that repeatedly using a fixed back wheel could cause knee problems, opinions differ. William Pearson, of Pearson, says the key to slowing down is to \"put your legs into neutral\" and use the front brake. Debra Rolfe, development officer for Britain's largest cycling organisation, the CTC, has never encountered anyone with severe knee injuries in her many years as a fixie rider. She thinks \"the claim that riding a fixed gear causes knee problems is a bit of an urban legend\". But Chris Juden, CTC's senior technical officer, urges caution, especially to those with ageing joints. \"Pushing too hard on a high gear is a known cause of trouble,\" he says. \"Riding fixed is not for anyone who has a tendency to knee problems\". </p> <p>Deciding whether it's healthy is one thing. Is it legal? The law says bikes should have two brakes, one for each wheel. You'll see many city couriers escaping through the chinks in jammed- up traffic with only one brake lever on their handlebars. The CTC says there's no clear definition of how braking systems should operate. So, at a pinch, these riders could argue that their front brake, plus the fixed back wheel, actually amount to the required two braking mechanisms. </p> <p>Fixie riding is purer, smoother and more organic, according to the enthusiasts. You have to read the road more carefully and regulate your pedal speed accordingly. Because your legs and the cranks are in perpetual motion, you and the bike feel merged like a single organism, just as Flann O'Brien described in his surreal masterpiece, The Third Policeman. </p> <p>Mechanical reliability and low maintenance are the other big pluses. </p> <p>Going down steep hills is probably best avoided, though. The sharper the incline, the faster your short fat hairy legs, to quote Eric Morecambe, will be spinning. </p> <p>I'm a convert to \"singledom\", but for now retain the ability to freewheel. There's nothing quite as liberating as manoeuvring through rush-hour traffic without having to bother about gears. Getting through a gap means pedalling harder - simple. I'm well on the way to shaking off the freewheeling habit altogether. My new fixation with the fixie is swiftly turning into a full-blown addiction. <br></p>",
  "<p>This weekend, eager astronomers will be scanning the night skies in expectation of a dazzling celestial light show. The Perseid meteor shower, so-called because meteors appear to be radiating from the constellation of Perseus, is an annual event that has been observed for more than 2,000 years. </p> <p>\"The meteors are formed when the Earth passes through the orbit of the Swift-Tuttle comet,\" explains Professor Ian Morison, astronomer at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. \"Essentially, a comet is a dirty snowball and, when it passes the sun, the ice turns to gas and releases dust particles. If the Earth passes through a comet's orbit, those particles are swept up into our atmosphere. As they are moving at about 20,000 miles an hour, they have a lot of energy and it makes them glow.\"</p> <p>While many people (including Morison) headed to China for an optimum view of the recent solar eclipse, the prime location for Perseid spotting is closer to home: your back garden. \"There's no ideal geographical point to see the Perseids, but there are optimum conditions to see as many shooting stars as possible,\" says Morison. \"First, find somewhere dark, away from street lights if possible. If you're in a city, then head to the east side so you're not looking over the city's lights. Then you want to look towards the constellation of Perseus in the east of a clear night sky after midnight.\" It could start anytime from tomorrow and go on until August 14.</p> <p>Jodrell Bank is hosting a sold-out Perseid Meteor Shower party this Saturday, featuring a barbecue, some skilled pointing towards the sky and, if things go well, lots of oohing. \"My personal best with the Perseids is 75 in an hour, but given the right conditions, you could see hundreds - possibly thousands - of shooting stars if it develops into a meteor storm,\" says Morison. So come midnight, go into your back garden and brace yourself for a hot-dust spectacular.</p>",
  "<p>American authorities have uncovered a global computer hacking and credit card fraud ring spanning the US, eastern Europe and Asia, officials said.</p> <p>Eleven people from the US, China and three former Soviet republics have been charge with stealing more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers and selling them to criminals in the US and Europe, in one of the largest identity theft schemes on record.</p> <p>The indictments mark the end of a three-year investigation involving law enforcement authorities from at least four countries. US attorney general Michael Mukasey said the financial toll in the case is \"impossible to quantify at this point\". </p> <p>Michael Sullivan, a justice department lawyer, said that most of the victims were in the US but officials have yet to identify all those whose credit card numbers were stolen. \"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the companies thought to have been targeted, TJX, is the parent of the British retail chain TK Maxx. In January, TJX admitted that information from 45.7 million credit and debit cards on both sides of the Atlantic had been stolen. Names, card numbers and personal data were stolen over a 17-month period and covering transactions dating as far back as December 2002. </p> <p>According to justice department officials and court documents, members of the ring drove close to US retail stores in search of wireless internet connections on which they installed \"sniffer\" software that would record card numbers.</p> <p>The suspects then sold the numbers over the internet to individuals who encoded them on blank credit cards and withdrew tens of thousands of dollars at a time from cash machines.</p> <p>According to court documents unsealed this week, three of the defendants, Sergey Pavlovich of Belarus, and Dzmitry Burak and Sergey Storchak of Ukraine, used a website on which credit card traffickers bought and sold data, with Pavlovich taking a percentage of the sales.</p> <p>Two other defendants, Maksym Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine, and Aleksandr Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia, known on the internet as JonnyHell, allegedly captured credit and debit card numbers from a New York restaurant. Justice officials said Yastremskiy pocketed more than $11m from the sale of the stolen numbers.</p> <p>One of the defendants, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, was an informant for the US Secret Service, the agency tasked with protecting the US president and combating financial fraud and counterfeiting. Gonzalez faces life in prison if convicted on all charges.</p>",
  "<p>Texas was accused yesterday of putting Americans abroad at risk by defying the international court of justice and the government of Mexico to carry out the execution of a Mexican national.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn was put to death by lethal injection on Tuesday night at a prison north of Houston. His lawyers said that the execution breached America's treaty obligations, which give foreign nationals such as Medell\u00edn the right to consult consular officials. </p> <p>\"With this action, our nation has broken a commitment willingly made by our president and our Senate when we agreed to this treaty,\" said Donald Francis Donovan. \"We must now hope that other nations stand stronger in their promises than we do, lest our own citizens be placed at risk elsewhere.\"</p> <p>The Mexican government had filed a letter of protest about the case, and the ICJ had demanded a judicial review for Medell\u00edn. President George Bush had also asked Texas to review the case but was overruled by the supreme court.</p> <p>Lawyers for Medell\u00edn, who was convicted of rape and murder, then sought a last-minute delay in his execution date, hoping to give Congress time to enact legislation that would bring America into line with an international treaty giving foreign citizens accused of crimes the right to consult consular officials.</p> <p>The Texas authorities and the supreme court both rejected the appeals.<br>Medell\u00edn was the first of 51 Mexican citizens on death row similarly denied access to their diplomats.</p> <p>After spending virtually all of his adult life in prison, Medell\u00edn, 33, used his final moments to apologise to the parents of his two teenage victims. The parents watched his execution. \"I'm sorry my actions caused you pain,\" Medell\u00edn told them. \"I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbour hate.\" </p> <p>The Mexican government has now sent a note of protest to the US state department, expressing \"its concern for the precedent that [the execution] may create for the rights of Mexican nationals\".</p> <p>Medell\u00edn and five other teenage boys took part in the rape and murder of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14, in 1993.</p>",
  "<p>Six US military officers convicted Osama bin Laden's former driver yesterday of supporting terrorism but cleared him of more serious conspiracy charges in the first demonstration of the Bush administration's much-condemned legal regime at Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who said he earned $200 a month as Bin Laden's driver and occasional bodyguard, was the first person to face a US war crimes tribunal since the second world war. </p> <p>While Hamdan was convicted of providing menial services to Bin Laden - driving and ferrying weapons - the uniformed jurors cleared him of conspiring in terrorist attacks. </p> <p>The conclusion of Hamdan's trial gives the Bush administration its first guilty verdict against any of the hundreds of detainees who have passed through Guant\u00e1namo since the offshore detention camp was created six years ago.</p> <p>Reporters covering the trial said Hamdan, who is in his 40s, held his head in his hands and wept when the verdict was read. It took the officers about eight hours over three days to reach its decision. Hamdan, who was to be sentenced later yesterday, could face a maximum life term.</p> <p>With the verdict, the Bush administration has the first concrete result of its efforts to create a new set of legal rules for detainees in the war on terror. The administration chose Guant\u00e1namo as a repository for al-Qaida suspects and detainees captured in Afghanistan because it believed the offshore camp could operate outside the reach of the US court system. </p> <p>White House and Pentagon officials immediately held the conclusion of Hamdan's trial as proof that, after long delays and successful supreme court challenges by detainee lawyers, Guant\u00e1namo had a fully functioning legal system. </p> <p>\"The military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process,\" the White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said. \"We look forward to other cases moving forward to trial.\"</p> <p>It is unlikely that Hamdan's conviction will provide international legitimacy to Guant\u00e1namo. Lawyers and human rights activists noted that much of Hamdan's trial was conducted in secret, and that the prosecution relied on information obtained through 40 interrogation sessions, some by CIA agents.</p> <p>Lawyers also noted that the single charge on which Hamdan was convicted had never before been considered a war crime, and was not regarded as such when the driver was detained. Congress designated the act of providing material support to terrorism as a war crime when it authorised the tribunals in 2006.</p> <p>\"Having no convictions after six-plus years was a black mark, but having a conviction after a process that was unfair to begin with, and that was largely conducted in secret, does not begin to erase the black mark,\" said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown who has written extensively about Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Ben Wizner, who observed the trial for the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \"In the strange world of Guant\u00e1namo justice, even if Hamdan had been acquitted on all charges, he would have been detained indefinitely.\"</p> <p>Reprieve, the British rights campaign group, called Hamdan's hearing a \"show trial\". It also pointed out that Hamdan had provided information to lead US forces to Bin Laden. \"These trials need to be professional, clear and open,\" said Reprieve. \"We've got a shambles that brings us no closer to justice.\"</p> <p>Hamdan, captured at a roadblock in Afghanistan in November 2001, also emerged as a minor figure in the war on terror. At his trial, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged 9/11 mastermind, was dismissive of his role in al-Qaida.</p> <p>Even so, the administration believes that the Hamdan case clears the way for the cases of 20 other detainees, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who have been charged under the military tribunals.</p> <p>The legal rationale for Guant\u00e1namo was thrown into doubt last June when the supreme court ruled that detainees had the right to challenge their detention in US courts. </p> <p>Omar Khadr, a Canadian captured as a teenager in Afghanistan, is expected to go on trial in October.</p> <p>However, Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the military commissions, said that only about 60 to 80 of the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo were ever likely to be put up on war crimes charges. At present, about 265 detainees are being held there.</p>",
  "<p>Good design is really rare. From this I think we can conclude that it's really difficult. I was thinking about this as I watched the comments pile up earlier this week on the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/2008/08/04/why_free_software_usability_tends_to_suck.html\">Technology blog</a> post pointing to a rant about the usability - or otherwise - of free software. But as the commenters pointed out, it's not only free software that suffers from this problem, which implies logically that the problem lies not in the cost of the software, but in the process and the people involved.</p> <p>For instance, I've never come across a piece of software from Microsoft that left me breathless in amazement at its combination of simplicity and power. With Microsoft, you get either/or. You get software that does a couple of things and doesn't trouble you, or you get something that can do something near to a billion things, and tells you all about most of them all the time. I still find it a frustrating business visiting the network control panel in Windows XP: it's like the sketch, decades old but still relevant, of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZutcPUd_AVQ\">the man going into a hi-fi shop and asking for \"a gramophone\"</a>. At which the shop assistants turn like radar dishes and begin mercilessly poking fun at the man, asking absurd questions about what he wants. XP's network control panel treats me the same way. There are all sorts of weird things in there, most of which I'm not interested in. And the ones I am interested in are hidden or wrapped in such obtuse language that I give up.</p> <p>You're thinking that I'm going to say that Apple is a paragon of good design - and on both the hardware and computer software front, it often is. It frequently conforms to the idea that the zenith of design is reached when you can't take anything more away, rather than when you can't add any more.</p> <p>But here's the interesting thing. Apple is very good at design: you can measure its abrupt improvement in hardware design back pretty much to the day when Steve Jobs rejoined the company in 1996. The role of Jobs was to champion the winning design; because before that Jonathan Ive's genius was well-hidden in the boring beige boxes Apple churned out.</p> <p>However, Apple's top-down approach to design is a bust when it comes to its approach to the software for the iPhone. Developers for that are up in arms. </p> <p>People are astonishingly angry at the fact that Apple first won't let them talk about how to develop for the iPhone - because everything about programming for it remains under a non-disclosure agreement - and second, hasn't let them get at its most useful application programming interfaces (APIs). Mike Ash, a programmer at the independent Mac developer Rogue Amoeba, has posted <a href=\"http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/welcome-to-iphone-your-crappy-mac-of-tomorrow-today.html\">a long and annoyed rant</a> about this in which he says that after a month using the iPod Touch, with its new software: \"I feel like I've gone back to the dark ages.\" Multitasking is a thing of the past, and it's impossible for third-party developers to design well, because Apple's keeping the best parts of the API hidden. Apple can design something that will multitask but others can't. The developers want in too.</p> <p>Apple's constant refrain is that it's all about making sure the phone isn't going to be destroyed by applications doing what they shouldn't. It's starting to wear thin, though. Palm opened its platform to outside developers, which helped it kill Psion. Apple's disdain for badly designed outside software is hurting it more than it knows. The developers who were ready to be its friends are turning into its enemies. And let nobody forget that Steve Ballmer's most memorable leaping-about moment - screaming \"Developers! Developers! Developers!\" - was greeted with applause. From developers. Look at how well Microsoft has done and compare it with the iPhone, which is teetering on a brink.</p> <p>Good design is rare. But eager developers are even more rare. Let them in, Apple.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:charles.arthur@theguardian.com\">charles.arthur@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday August 7 2008.

  "<p>If only the world had known that last week's match in Abuja, Nigeria, between Manchester United and Portsmouth to decide the outcome of the Tinapa Invitational Soccer Fiesta was such a pivotal moment for English football perhaps it would have paid closer attention.</p> <p>Still, for the many millions whose gaze was diverted elsewhere here is a brief summary of the events leading up to the match and the great event itself: United, alerted by a recent Foreign Office warning that all British nationals should leave the Niger delta, arrived in town accompanied by a hostage negotiator; Portsmouth played Kano Pillars FC in the opening game of a three-team competition in what the local press described as a \"near-empty\" stadium; before Sunday's match, between the two English clubs, 10,000 fans rioted outside amid complaints that ticket prices were as high as 50,000 naira (\u00a3215 - almost twice the average monthly wage in Nigeria); then, to quote another local newspaper, \"security men had to run for their lives when they could not withstand the militancy of the spectators who forced their way into the stadium thereby causing a stampede\"; the 10,000 non-paying customers increased the attendance to 35,000, in a 60,000-capacity stadium; and the tournament organisers lost money.</p> <p>Oh yes, and United won 2-1 thanks to goals by Chris Eagles and Carlos Tevez.</p> <p>Most people might read this summary and conclude the Tinapa Invitational Soccer Fiesta was something of a shambles, but then most people weren't in Abuja to chaperon the United squad at the personal invitation of Sir David Richards, the chairman of the Premier League. Garth Crooks, the former Tottenham and United player, was and here is what he had to say about the event: \"It wasn't just a success, it was a resounding success, one of the best friendlies I have ever seen.\" As for crowd control problems, Sir David's man on the spot had this to say: \"The more chaos at matches, the more Africans enjoy it.\"</p> <p>We could spend the rest of the column discussing the casual - some might say offensive - characterisation of Africans and their alleged enjoyment of chaos at football matches but then we would have little room left to examine what might be one reason for Crooks' proselytising for English teams playing against each other on foreign soil. \"I'm in absolutely no doubt whatsoever it [the tournament] would be a success, whether in Australia, Asia or Africa,\" he said - a conveniently upbeat interpretation of an inconveniently chaotic weekend in Nigeria which dovetailed nicely with the news that the Premier League is considering introducing a winter break in 2011 and using the time to stage a series of \"mini tournaments\" around the globe.</p> <p>Thus the discredited \"39th game\" concept is reborn, albeit in a form that would not upset home-and-away symmetry which is integral to the League. Nor will those loyal fans need worry about missing a vital game because they cannot afford the flight to Bangkok. Why would they bother to travel so far for a meaningless friendly between two sets of players who would rather be spending their break on the beach in Dubai?</p> <p>For this we should all be thankful. We should also congratulate the Premier League for its tacit acknowledgment that its original plan was flawed and its decision to press ahead with a more modest proposal.</p> <p>Yet Sir David and his colleagues should move cautiously. It takes a rare kind of self-denial to herald the Tinapa Invitational Soccer Fiesta as a template for the future of English football abroad, just as it takes a dangerous self-belief to think the rest of the world is beside itself at the prospect of mid-season friendlies between Manchester United and Portsmouth, never mind Wigan and Hull City.</p> <p>Last weekend's shambles in Abuja should be confirmation of that, but anyone seeking conclusive proof should take a look at the Champions World Series - a series of games featuring the likes of United, Chelsea, Celtic and Barcelona staged in North America earlier this decade. Heralded as the future of soccer in the US, the series ended in ignominy as the company behind it went bankrupt. There were many reasons for this commercial failure, but the most serious was that those involved over-estimated the demand for meaningless games featuring European clubs.</p> <p><strong>Bold James shows the colour of his money</strong></p> <p>In the long and sometimes inglorious history of sport it is hard to think of a more cynical outlook on the world beyond the locker room than that expressed by Michael Jordan who, when asked to endorse a black Democrat candidate against a nasty, racist senator called Jesse Helms, replied: \"But Republicans wear sneakers too.\"</p> <p>Thus, the greatest basketball player who ever lived established the rule for other superstars who did not want to comment on political matters, among them his friend Tiger Woods, who is resolute in his refusal to engage in even the mildest form of political discourse.</p> <p>That is Woods' right, of course, although it might be enlightening if he took the trouble to explain why, when he was the victim of racism as a youngster, he has nothing worthwhile to say on the subject of race in 21st-century America.</p> <p>If it is the case that the world's most recognisable athlete is concerned that by speaking out he might endanger his commercial contracts then he need worry no longer. Last month the basketball player LeBron James, seen by many as Jordan's rightful heir, donated $20,000 to the presidential election campaign of Barack Obama. Twenty-thousand dollars is loose change to James but it was enough to let the nation know where he stood.</p> <p>So Tiger take note: not one of James' sponsors has cancelled his contract.</p> <p><strong>Why Hammers got off lightly with Ljungberg</strong></p> <p>Nothing will salve the pain West Ham United must be feeling today after handing Freddie Ljungberg \u00a36 million to go away, but let me try anyway.</p> <p>At the start of the season, the Los Angeles Dodgers gave centre-fielder Andruw Jones a two-year contract worth $18 million (\u00a39.3m) a year - the highest annual salary in the club's history.</p> <p>Since then Jones has produced what one newspaper columnist described this week as \"the worst season by a centre-fielder in major league history\", as well as being christened \"Tubbo\" by no less an authority than the sports pages of the LA Times.</p> <p>Then there is the sad story of Barry Zito, given a $126 million (\u00a364.6m) contract to be the ace pitcher for the San Francisco Giants and who turns out to be even more useless at striking out major league batters than Ljungberg is at tormenting Premier League defences.</p> <p>There is little consolation to be had from the misfortune of others but it will surely come as a relief to those in charge at West Ham to know they do not have a monopoly on mindless profligacy.</p> <p><strong>Goodbye and good riddance to the torch relay</strong></p> <p>It is too early to argue that China's Olympics have been an overwhelming success, so we will play it safe and merely say that at least one good thing has emerged. The IOC's decision to dispense with the torch relay before the 2012 Games is welcome indeed, and not just because it is the most tangible remaining link with the Nazis who dreamed it up to adorn the 1936 Games in Berlin. The relay was commercialism dressed up as \"tradition\" - a cynical, exploitative and pretentious marketing exercise which should have been abandoned long ago.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lawrence.donegan@theguardian.com\">lawrence.donegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>London's Olympic organisers delivered a progress report to the International Olympic Committee's annual session in Beijing yesterday and, as has become routine, received a glowing vote of confidence in return.</p> <p>London's reception in IOC circles has long contrasted with the rocky ride it gets at home, but for the organising committee's chief executive, Paul Deighton, his visit to the Chinese capital has raised another challenge with which he will have to grapple in the next four years. How do you follow Beijing?</p> <p>Over the next three weeks we will see a Games on a scale unprecedented in Olympic history. China has spent more money, laid more concrete and employed more people than any previous host, and the impact is likely to be spectacular.</p> <p>London will have to be built and delivered within far less lavish parameters, with the main stadium the best example. Whereas Beijing has built a spectacular monument to China's new-found confidence, London will build a temporary facility for 18 days and then dismantle it, leaving a modest 25,000-seat stadium.</p> <p>Deighton, who presented to the IOC yesterday in the absence of his committee's chairman, Lord Coe, who has remained in the UK to be with his ill father, said London would not suffer from the contrast. \"The Olympics in Beijing is going to be so different to London and the beauty is in the contrast,\" he said. \"I think the Beijing Games could end up being unique - I'm not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this. London is much more likely to be the model for Games in the future. It's important for the IOC to establish that sort of standard, otherwise it's narrowing the potential field of candidates who can stage a Games.\"</p> <p>Deighton leads a team of more than 100 staff who will be working alongside their counterparts on the Beijing organising committee and he is confident that the closer they get to the field of play the more they will be able to learn. \"The key thing I want our team to get a sense of is the scale and intensity of the Olympic Games,\" he said. \"I want our team to have had battle experience. I don't want London 2012 to be the first time they stick their head up out of the trench, see 10,000 people charging at them and they want to run away.\"</p> <p>London will face pressure to introduce anti-doping legislation similar to that in force in Italy and China, which makes possession of performance-enhancing drugs illegal. The IOC medical commissioner, Arne Ljungqvist, pressed Deighton on the subject yesterday and he said legislation was being considered.</p> <p>Of more immediate concern will be matching the athletes' village in Beijing, described by the British Olympic Association chief executive, Simon Clegg, as the best in Olympic history. To do so the government will need to resolve the funding crisis that has stalled the project. Lend Lease, the construction firm that has taken on the job, is seeking more public money after struggling to raise its share of the original deal in the credit markets. </p> <p>Deighton is confident a solution will be found this month and that there will be no compromise on quality. \"The driving thrust in the village is that you have to sell these apartments for a decent price afterwards, so they are going to have to be built to a quality that will sell and hopefully turn into the place to be in London. We hope a deal will be done by Christmas.\"</p> <p>He believes that the slump in the financial markets will not adversely affect other areas of the Games' organisation - ticketing and merchandise revenue will not start to flow until 2011, broadcast and IOC sponsorship deals have been done, and he has already raised more than half of the projected \u00a3650m in domestic sponsorship revenue.</p> <p>With the prospect of financial security he can afford to consider the bigger picture this month. \"If we can produce a Games that is manageable in terms of finance, planning and operations then I think we will have achieved something,\" he said.</p> <h2>Reedie faces challenge</h2> <p>Sir Craig Reedie will today attempt to become the first Briton to sit on the IOC's executive board since the 1960s when the membership meets to elect new officials. It is traditional for future host cities to have a representative on the board, but Reedie faces a stiff challenge if he is to win a seat as he will have to unseat incumbent Richard Carrion, a Puerto Rican banker who chairs the IOC's finance commission and is tipped in some quarters as a potential successor to president Jacques Rogge. The situation simplified yesterday when Carrion and Reedie said they would not contest the first of the two seats available, stepping aside in favour of the only female candidate, Nawal El Moutawakel, of Morocco.</p>",
  "<p>Sussex were hoping the return of Mushtaq Ahmed after a second knee operation of the summer would ignite a late charge to a fourth championship in six years, but it was his junior spinning partner Ollie Rayner who did the damage yesterday.</p> <p>Rayner, a 22-year-old off-spinner who at 6ft 5in should always have the ability to extract a little extra bounce, took five for 65 on a scruffy-looking pitch already offering him and Mushtaq plenty of help.</p> <p>The Pakistani had to settle for one wicket but remained engaging and occasionally threatening, and regular Sussex watchers took encouragement from the return of his vociferous appealing as an indication that the old Mushtaq is on the way back.</p> <p>His presence was crucial in what turned out to be a disastrous decision by Stuart Law to bat first in sultry conditions that might have been designed for a skilful swing bowler such as Jason Lewry. The left-armer obliged by exposing Lou Vincent and producing a couple of crackers to account for Iain Sutcliffe and Paul Horton, reducing Lancashire to 16 for three.</p> <p>Law's efforts ended with a loose drive at Luke Wright and Francois du Plessis wasted 26 overs' graft with an overambitious sweep to gift Rayner the first of four consecutive wickets. Steven Croft and Glen Chapple poked to slip, and Rayner found sharp turn from around the wicket to trap Dominic Cork lbw and break his eighth-wicket stand with Luke Sutton, who was five short of a half-century when Sajid Mahmood holed out to long-on.</p>",
  "<p>August is often an excellent month for conspiracies, but Labour's electoral meltdown and David Miliband's finely tuned bid for power have turned it into a plotters' paradise. The excitement was all supposed to have died down by now, as the contenders and their spear-carriers retired for a period of quiet holiday reflection. But instead the cabals and clans are at fever pitch, as MPs and ministers endlessly calculate the odds of a direct challenge to the prime minister next month in a blizzard of mobile and text messages across the beaches and hill towns of Europe. </p> <p>The Blairites in particular are unable to control themselves, such is their excitement at having propelled their candidate into pole position, as they smell the blood of a badly wounded prime minister. With every day bringing fresh leaks and denials - yesterday it was over claims that Miliband had already offered Alan Milburn the job of chancellor in his future administration - the Blairite insurgency is in full flood.</p> <p>Most of the media have meanwhile already cast their bloc vote for the foreign secretary. He will also be able to draw on serious cash and business backing. But it's a good deal less clear why replacing Gordon Brown with David Miliband would deliver what Labour, or the country for that matter, is actually looking for. </p> <p>Sure, he's potentially a more attractive figure than the tortured and reviled Brown, and he showed last week that he is at last shedding his gawky, policy wonk persona. Doubtless he has never drifted as far right as his one-time patron or wilder camp followers. But this is a man who was at Tony Blair's side from the start, and played a central role in the engine room of New Labour. Nothing he has said or done in government has suggested any doubts about the fundamentals of the project. </p> <p>As foreign secretary, he has continued to back the disastrous occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan and failed to end the government's humiliating deference towards the Bush administration. With the exception of his coy reference to a \"downturn made in Wall Street\", there was nothing in his Guardian piece last week to suggest Miliband recognises the need to ditch the discredited New Labour formulas of the past. On the contrary, he complained that the government hadn't kicked off its health \"reforms\" - New Labour-speak for privatisation - even earlier. His strongest supporters are almost entirely drawn from the rump of Blairite true believers. Miliband clearly represents continuity, not change.</p> <p>That was what Brown promised a year ago but has signally failed to deliver, to his and Labour's cost. There is in any case serious doubt about whether Miliband's lieutenants in parliament - who are themselves split over tactics - will be able to muster the 71 MPs needed for a contest under the party constitution. And even if they were to succeed in ousting Brown, there is as yet no obvious alternative candidate prepared to speak for the majority, in the Labour party and outside, who want to see a decisive shift of political direction.</p> <p>The leftwing Campaign Group MP John McDonnell would certainly try to stand, as might the centre-left Compass MP Jon Cruddas, in an effort to widen the policy debate. Within the cabinet, from where any credible challenge would have to come, the health secretary Alan Johnson would probably be in the strongest position to defeat Miliband, with a backstory as a postal worker that would certainly puncture the confected everyman image of the Tory leader David Cameron. But he would have to work hard to dump his own Blairite baggage and has yet to show his hand. </p> <p>Meanwhile, dozens of Labour MPs who stand to lose their seats in the early election that they fear would be forced on any new Labour leader reckon a better bet would be to hold on to Brown, let him absorb the flak for problems he helped to create as recession bites deeper - and dump him if necessary next autumn, when they hope the economy might be about to pick up.</p> <p>What neither Brown nor his rivals seem yet to have grasped is the scale of political change needed to deal with the new conditions triggered by global financial crisis, falling living standards and recession - and the bankruptcy of a deregulated market model all the rage during a boom that has now evaporated. </p> <p>Last week, the conservative Wall Street Journal reported on the \"new wave of government regulation of business and the economy\" and \"backlash against laissez-faire\" sweeping the US in the wake of the credit crunch. But in Britain, a deeply embattled Brown is said to be still resisting the kind of popular radical measures against rampant corporate power, such as a windfall tax on the oil companies, that even some Blairites privately support. </p> <p>Brown has a choice. He could face down the threat of a counter-coup and relaunch his premiership next month by breaking with untrammelled neoliberalism and making the move beyond Blairism he ducked last summer. He could announce an emergency package of measures that would tilt government policy unambiguously towards greater equality and public intervention - such as controls on utility prices, a shift of the tax burden from the low-paid to the rich, and a major public housing programme. He could make a conference speech that reminded voters of what Labour is supposed to stand for and carry out a reshuffle reflecting the new approach: cutting the disproportionate Blairite presence down to size - the corporate-fawning business secretary John Hutton would be a popular victim - and bringing in left-leaning MPs like Cruddas and Jon Trickett.</p> <p>Alternatively, he can stagger on like John Major as a shadow prime minister and prisoner of his predecessor's partisans, timidly triangulating until he or his government finally crashes and burns. Both his record and his character - and the leaks from No 10 - suggest the latter is more likely. As one prominent New Labour figure put it to me yesterday: \"Gordon doesn't like to pick fights and this is a time when you've got to be prepared to pick fights.\"</p> <p>Either way, the challenge for the rest of the party has to be to crystallise what is already a clear majority for a more progressive and popular policy agenda: on pensions, health, housing, tax, regulation and Iraq. With or without Brown, Labour has to take a new political direction to survive. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Office of Fair Trading is preparing to press price-fixing charges against four former and current British Airways executives. An announcement could come today.</p> <p>It is understood that individual charges will be brought against Andrew Crawley, BA's head of sales, former marketing director Martin George, the ex-communications head Iain Burns and Alan Burnett, who once ran UK and Ireland sales for the airline. The men were on the list of 10 former and current BA executives identified by the US government as being liable to possible extradition and prosecution over a scandal that has already cost BA \u00a3270m in fines.</p> <p>Anyone acquitted or convicted of price-fixing in Britain cannot be charged with the same offence in the US - lessening the chances of the four being extradited if they are charged by the OFT. Price-fixing carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail under UK law. Three British businessmen, Peter Whittle, David Brammar and Bryan Allison, were jailed for between two-and-a-half and three years each in June for cartel offences under the Enterprise Act in a case brought by the OFT over the price-fixing of marine hoses.</p> <p>The OFT and BA declined to comment yesterday. BA was fined \u00a3121.5m by the OFT and $300m (\u00a3150m) by the US department of justice last year for colluding over the setting of fuel-surcharges for cargo and long-haul passenger flights. The most high-profile offence related to a price-fixing scam that BA operated in tandem with Virgin Atlantic, a close rival that escaped prosecution by blowing the whistle on the collusion and calling in regulators.</p> <p>George and Burns left BA in October 2006. George left with a compensation package worth up to \u00a31.6m and has yet to find a full-time job, while Burns has moved to Dubai where he is employed by the Etihad airline. George admitted in his resignation statement that his department might have discussed surcharges with a competitor - strictly against competition laws and BA's guidelines. George said there might have been \"inappropriate conversations\". It is alleged that BA contacted arch-rival Virgin Atlantic through its press department about plans to raise fuel surcharges.</p> <p>Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, has described the legal breach as \"deeply regrettable\" and last year said he would be \"very happy\" to see full details of the scandal emerge in court because people \"deserve to know what happened\". When asked if he was referring to Virgin Atlantic's role in the cartel, Walsh said he could not comment on the individuals or companies involved. BA is still paying for the collusion, along with Virgin Atlantic.</p> <p>Both airlines have established a \u00a3100m compensation fund for passengers who were caught out by the price-fixing, which took place between August 2004 and January 2006. Customers in Britain are entitled to a payout of up to \u00a320 per return ticket, depending on the size of the fuel levy when the ticket was booked. It is understood that the remaining six former BA employees are still under investigation by the department of justice.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners for tougher controls on guns in the US are reeling from the allegation that a prominent member of the movement for more than a decade was a spy working for the powerful pro-gun lobby the National Rifle Association.</p> <p>Mary Lou McFate sat on the board of two groups campaigning for greater controls, and tried to become a director of the national umbrella group of the movement, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She was also linked with the circle of an international campaign on small arms trade based in London.</p> <p>To the outrage of campaigners who worked with her, she has been outed by Mother Jones, the political magazine, as a paid plant for the NRA. An investigation by the magazine based on court documents suggests that she made contact with the NRA as early as 1999 and that the connection was sustained to this day.</p> <p>Her alleged intelligence work for the gun lobby was partly organised through a defunct detective agency in Maryland. Beckett Brown International received $80,000 from the NRA in 1999 and 2000 for various services, court depositions show. The NRA failed to return calls yesterday and McFate, 62, was also unavailable.</p> <p>McFate sat on the board of CeaseFire Pennsylvania and a national federation of gun control groups known as States United to Prevent Gun Violence. Her details are still posted on CeaseFire PA's website under its list of board members, noting that she has been involved in gun violence prevention since the first federal ban on assault weapons was passed in 1995.</p> <p>She put herself forward unsuccessfully to be taken on to the board of the Brady Campaign, the country's most important organisation for tighter controls named after Jim Brady, Ronald Reagan's press secretary who was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on the then president.</p> <p>Brian Malte, the campaign's director of state legislation, worked closely with her for 10 years. He said he was stunned when he at first heard the claims. \"She was a seemingly passionate advocate of gun violence prevention, yet she refused to be a local spokesman in Florida where she lived. She didn't want her name in the press or press releases,\" he said.</p> <p>Malte said that her contacts would have allowed her to learn details of the tactics groups were using to try to defeat moves by President George Bush and the NRA to liberalise gun laws, which could have been useful to the NRA.</p> <p>Those who have felt a sense of betrayal over the allegations most keenly are campaigners who themselves have lost love ones to gun violence. Toby Hoover, director of an Ohio-based coalition on guns, became involved after her husband was killed in a robbery. \"It is beyond my comprehension how someone could have listened to my story and expressed desire to help prevent others from having to experience the agony I went through, all the time collecting money as a gun lobby spy.\"</p> <p>Two weeks ago McFate attended a UN conference in New York on weapons trafficking, having gained accreditation through the London-based International Action Network on Small Arms. IANSA's director, Rebecca Peters, said: \"A lot of us are wondering who else is spying on us, and whether we would recognise them.\"</p> <p>Mother Jones discovered that McFate was living under her married name, Mary Lou Sapone. The magazine alleges that under that name she earlier infiltrated an animal rights group to gather intelligence on behalf of a surgical-equipment company involved in animal experiments.</p> <p>The groups with whom McFate was involved are in discussions about potential legal action against her and the NRA.</p>",
  "<p>Violent protests have shaken Bolivia and forced the leaders of Venezuela and Argentina to cancel a visit to the country in the run-up to a referendum on Evo Morales' rule.</p> <p>Demonstrators hostile to the president besieged an airport and clashed with police in Tarija, in southern Bolivia, forcing authorities on Tuesday to abandon a summit between Morales and his South American allies. The clashes underlined combustible tensions on the eve of Sunday's referendum, which will ask voters whether Morales and provincial governors should stay in power.</p> <p>The Andean nation's first indigenous president hopes the vote will shore up his leadership and revive a faltering effort to \"refound\" Bolivia as a socialist state that champions the rights of the long-neglected indigenous majority.<br>The combative coca farmer turned president has vowed to overturn 500 years of colonialism and domination by pale-skinned elites which have left indigenous people, estimated at 60% of the population, mired in poverty. <br>But opponents accuse Morales of autocracy and recklessness. They have blocked key policies, leaving the country polarised and politically paralysed.<br>Opposition activists tried to storm Tarija airport as it prepared to receive Morales' regional allies, Argentina's president, Cristina Kirchner, and the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>The summit was supposedly about gas and oil supplies but was in reality a display of leftwing partisanship, said local opposition leader Reynaldo Bayard. \"They said they are going to sign an energy agreement, but it's a political show in support of Morales,\" he said. </p> <p>As the crowd clashed with riot police, who used tear gas to regain control, a decision was made to cancel the meeting to avoid further inflaming the situation.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, an economic sponsor of Morales, blamed the protests on the US. \"We have decided to suspend the trip to Tarija because the North American empire is attacking,\" he said. It was a sign of Washington's desperation on the eve of a democratic vote, he added.</p> <p>Sunday's referendum will determine whether the president, the vice president and eight elected regional governors, among them leading opposition figures, will stay in office. </p> <p>Morales is expected to survive. To eject him his opponents must gain more votes than he won in 2005, when he gained 53.7% in a historic landslide. If several opposition governors are ousted, the president could revive his push for a new constitution. But with the eastern lowlands expected to remain opposition bastions, the deadlock is likely to continue.</p> <p>In a separate protest over pension reforms, miners in Oruro clashed with police, leaving two miners dead and more than 30 injured.</p>",
  "<p>A man charged in connection with the kidnapping of a seven-year-old London-based girl is to be interviewed by Los Angeles police investigating the disappearance of a California couple more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>But even as law enforcement agencies across the country focused on the man claiming to be Clark Rockefeller, his true identity remained unclear. Admitting that the case was \"very unusual\", Suffolk county district attorney Daniel Conley told MSNBC Wednesday that, \"One thing we're sure of, he's not Clark Rockefeller.\"</p> <p>LA detectives were due to speak to Rockefeller yesterday in connection with the disappearance of Jonathan Sohus, 26, and his wife Linda, 28, from their home in the affluent city of San Marino in 1985.</p> <p>Rockefeller, 48, was arrested in an FBI sting in Baltimore on Saturday after a week-long manhunt. Following a court appearance on Monday he was extradited to Boston, where he was charged with kidnapping, battery with a dangerous weapon and endangering a minor.</p> <p>But LA police think Rockefeller may be Christopher Crowe Mountbatten Chichester, a suspect in the disappearance of the San Marino couple. Chichester, who claimed to be the son of a British aristocrat, rented a guest house on the couple's property. Three years after their disappearance in 1985 he vanished.</p> <p>Shortly after he disappeared, in 1988, a man named Christopher Crowe tried to sell the missing couple's car.</p> <p>District attorney Conley said that Rockefeller's fingerprints matched those of Charles Smith, who has a criminal record. The prints may be linked to the California case. During Tuesday's hearing, Rockefeller's only remark was to deny that he was Smith. \"That's not me,\" he muttered.</p> <p>Smith is the latest in a string of aliases possibly used by Rockefeller that have stymied attempts to determine the real identity of the man in custody in Boston.</p> <p>LA detectives concluded at the time of the original disappearance that the man calling himself Chichester was a German national named Christian Gerhart Streiter. </p> <p>Clark Rockefeller first appeared in New York city in 1993, moving in high society and boasting a blue-chip art collection. The following year he married Sandra Boss and the two had a daughter, Reigh Storrow Boss, nicknamed Snooks.</p> <p>At the end 2007, the couple divorced with Boss, now based in London, getting full custody. The father was given supervised visiting rights. It has been reported that one of the reasons for the divorce was Boss's doubts about her husband's identity. At the same time that their divorce was finalised, a man called Charles \"Chip\" Smith appeared in Baltimore searching for a home for him and his daughter.</p> <p>Last month, Rockefeller bought gold bullion and shortly afterwards, on July 27 in Boston during the first supervised visit, Rockefeller allegedly pushed a social worker aside and threw Reigh into the back of a waiting vehicle, sparking a huge manhunt. He was traced to Baltimore, where FBI officers lured him away from the girl and rescued her. A pre-trial hearing is set for September 3.</p>",
  "<p>Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned. Or so it seemed yesterday afternoon when 20 brides and a smattering of grooms marched on the headquarters of HSBC in London to demand their missing wedding presents. </p> <p>The incongruous protest amid the gleaming office towers of Canary Wharf came 48 hours after the collapse of Wrapit, an internet wedding list company which had promised \"the ultimate wedding service\" but went into administration on Monday with gifts worth \u00a33.5m undelivered.</p> <p>The message from protesters was clear: we want our Le Creuset sets, dinner services and tea towels and we want them now, or at the very least, a prompt refund. Attired in wedding dresses, veils and sparkling crystal tiaras, and carrying, in one instance, a symbolically empty Wrapit box, they represented about 4,000 newlyweds experiencing an unwelcome financial jilting.</p> <p>With almost all of Wrapit's staff laid off and KPMG installed as administrators of the Wandsworth-based firm, the couples vented their anger at the bank and picked Sarah Roberts, a 25-year-old bride sporting a satin dress and white veil, to deliver a 950-signature petition calling on HSBC to help arrange the delivery of those missing gifts or at least pay back their wedding guests, 100,000 of whom have been affected. HSBC, Wrapit's bank, had withdrawn its credit card processing facility.</p> <p>\"I have been surprised at how emotional I feel about this,\" said Sally Fraser, 34, a recruitment consultancy director who married in June and said she stands to lose her entire \u00a34,500 wedding list. \"It's not about the gifts its about the memories. These would have been lifelong purchases that would have reminded us of our friends and family. My mum and her partner got me a Le Creuset roasting pot ... I would have thought of her when I used it. I said to my husband I feel like we've been robbed; that someone has come into our house and burgled us.\"</p> <p>Michael O'Sullivan, 33, the organiser, sporting his wedding kilt, sporran and dirk, said the problems were like \"an indelible blemish\" on what should have been a \"magical experience\". </p> <p>\"I know it would be cheaper for HSBC to pay for our presents rather than arrange refunds,\" he said. </p> <p>Law student Gabriela Breza, 29, who married Kevin Krist last year, has lost \u00a37,000 of gifts. \"People who are questioning the march seem to think we are just a group of rich people marching for our expensive gifts, but for many a wedding list is a way of starting up a home.\"</p> <p>The couples appear to have been spurred on by Wrapit's ex-managing director, Peter Gelardi. He wrote to customers proposing HSBC should fund Wrapit to deliver all the outstanding gifts and urged the couples to lobby the bank's executives. In an email to customers, he wrote: \"When big banks change policies, little companies sometimes get squashed.\"</p> <p>HSBC has said it does not believe delivering the gifts \"appropriate or practical\" and pointed out the firm's long-held problems. Wrapit traded for eight years and made an operating loss for every year it filed accounts, totalling just over \u00a33m. Wrapit is the third company in which Gelardi, 62, has held a directorship that has been taken into the control of administrative receivers. World Telecom, which sold pre-paid phone cards and mobile phones, went into receivership in 2000 despite Gelardi's efforts. From 1997-1999 he was also director of Global Numbers Ltd which provided personal telephone numbers but the receivers were called in by 2000.</p> <p>Yesterday, Gelardi floated another idea: each couple could receive a voucher from Debenhams or Liberty for the value of their outstanding wedding presents. He said he had secured Debenhams' involvement, was waiting for Liberty to respond, and that KMPG had promised to consider the plan. But for the couples it seemed a distant hope.</p> <p>Sarah Ellis, 29, a teacher of deaf primary school children from Harrow, said she was most worried about her guests, almost all of whom paid for gifts by debit card which means they must apply to become creditors of the stricken company to have any hope of getting their money back.</p> <p>\"My mother-in-law died recently and she had bought us a \u00a3200 cutlery set which we are never going to get now,\" she said. \"We haven't got a penny out of this and we haven't got any gifts.\"</p>",
  "<p>The future of Manchester City is in doubt only 14 months after Thaksin Shinawatra completed his \u00a380m takeover of the club. The controversial former Thai prime minister has approached potential investors in the search for funds to bankroll Mark Hughes's spending this summer, raising concerns about his ability to release \u00a31bn in assets frozen in his homeland.</p> <p>City manager Hughes has brushed aside speculation that Shinawatra is poised to sell his stake in the club, however. Speaking after last night's 1-1 friendly draw with Celtic in Glasgow, Hughes said: \"I think there is old news which raises its head now and again. There is absolutely no issue there, the club is not going to be sold.</p> <p>\"The owner is looking for parties to come in and invest if they are the right people, and for the right areas of the business. But there is no intention to sell the club.\" When asked if any potential investment deal would have an effect on his transfer plans, Hughes replied: \"None whatsoever.\"</p> <p>City officials have confirmed that there have been \"exploratory\" discussions with investment groups but have denied that the club is again up for sale. Still, the possibility cannot be discounted, with investors, believed to be based in the Middle East and India, favouring full control above simply a stake in the club.</p> <p>The 59-year-old Shinawatra is on trial in Thailand on corruption charges and last week saw his wife, Pojaman, sentenced to three years in prison for tax fraud. Her brother, Bannapot Damapong, and secretary were sentenced to three and two years respectively. All have since been released on bail pending an appeal.</p> <p>Shinawatra vowed to clear his name on his return to Thailand but, without the \u00a31bn of assets he intended to release on acquittal, his value is estimated at about \u00a3200m. Having spent \u00a380m to purchase City he is in need of fresh investment to fulfil his ambition of bringing Champions League football to Eastlands. The Brazilian striker Jo was secured this summer with a reported down-payment of \u00a34m but the rest of his club-record \u00a319m price will be paid in instalments, as with all City's foreign signings under Shinawatra. </p> <p>City, moreover, face the ordeal of four games in eight days at the end of this month after being told they must play their Carling Cup second-round tie as scheduled. Eight clubs involved in Europe are given a bye into the third round of the Carling Cup but City, as the ninth team to qualify having landed a Uefa Fair Play prize, must enter at the second-round stage.</p>",
  "<p>The International Cricket Council delayed its decision whether to sanction the proposed schedule of the Champions Twenty20 League during an emergency summit yesterday, raising the prospect that it may not go ahead at all.</p> <p>As revealed in this column last week, the ICC has been under pressure from its broadcast and commercial partners, led by ESPN Star, over the Indian board's intention to hold the new 20-over competition 24 hours after the Champions Trophy closes in Pakistan. ESPN Star has warned of litigation over what it perceives as a threat to the value of its own $1.1bn broadcast contract with the ICC.</p> <p>The governing body impressed on the new league's shareholder nations, India, Australia and South Africa, that the proposed September 29 start date is the reserve day for the Champions Trophy final, presenting an unacceptable clash. The three nations' boards agreed to reconsider the scheduling but both Australia and South Africa are understood to have protested about the potential financial implications they would suffer if the event were moved. One possible window would be in March and April, shortly before the Indian Premier League season, but by then both South Africa and Australia will have new Twenty20 champions, at a time when four state teams have already been admitted to the tournament.</p> <p>An extraordinary board meeting of Cricket South Africa is scheduled over the next 48 hours as the Champions League's shareholders seek a solution.</p> <h2>Rebel league raises stakes</h2> <p>The Indian Cricket League has taken its most aggressive step yet, deciding to begin its new season on the second day of the first Test between India and Australia in October, competing directly with the Board of Control for Cricket in India for television viewers. The ICL, a tournament the BCCI has been trying to put out of existence, has announced that it will hold its new season's matches in Hyderabad, Delhi and Chandigarh from October 10. And while the International Cricket Council deliberates over whether the ICL's unsanctioned status is sustainable, it is believed there is increasing sympathy among member nations towards the rebel league. Sri Lanka Cricket's chairman, Arjuna Ranatunga, and the BCCI's Indian Premier League commissioner, Lalit Modi, have been in dispute over participation fees and the England and Wales Cricket Board fumes at having been frozen out of the BCCI's Champions Twenty20 League plans. With $40m (\u00a320.5m) on offer from the ICL for each match hosted at grounds such as Lord's and The Oval, it may not be long before it wins support in the ICC's Dubai headquarters.</p> <h2>Mutu case in limbo</h2> <p>Eight weeks after Fifa told the media by email that a decision had been reached on Adrian Mutu's cocaine case at Chelsea, the Premier League side have still not been advised what it is. Leaked reports in Italy said the Romania international would be held liable for the \u00a39m in potential transfer fees that Chelsea lost on sacking him for gross misconduct, but the lack of an update from the world governing body means those reports remain unconfirmed.</p> <h2>A league apart</h2> <p>As the Olympic Games get under way tomorrow night, eight days before the kick-off of the Premier League season, comparison of the two competitions' television incomes provides a measure of the commercial standing of English football. Television rights for the Beijing Games are expected to be worth a total \u00a3870m to the International Olympic Committee in what is a quadrennial event. The Premier League's combined live domestic and overseas rights deal earns it a comparable \u00a3900m a year; incomes are inflated by sales to pay-per-view channels, something the IOC declines to do. </p> <h2>Bernie rides again</h2> <p>Although England's Under-21 footballers have been denied a place at the Olympics by the politicking of the other home nations, the brass band that is a regular feature at England games has been rebranded for Beijing as the GB band. It will follow the British hockey team, and its trombone player, the Eighties funnyman Bernie Clifton, left, will make his contribution to the cultural exchange by \"performing\" on his \"ostrich\", Oswald. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matt.scott@theguardian.com\">matt.scott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Preparing for a week of solo evenings on the Fringe, I check myself out in the mirror. What have I got to offer? Well, physically not a lot. When Hitler conducted a similar self-examination before his next big speech at Nuremberg, he could at least see a pair of sharply focused eyeballs staring back at him, and his moustache had not yet lost its vibrancy. No part of my face remains vibrant. There are veteran quinces with more magnetism. But it won't matter as long as I can still talk. </p> <p>Talking solo for an hour on your feet is usually called standup, and right there is the first source of fear. The term \"standup\" is reserved for comedians, and nowadays there are hundreds of them, most of them so technically proficient that they can spend 55 minutes telling the story of what they had for breakfast while they roam the stage like wild animals. The last five minutes is consumed by the apocalyptic applause of the audience, uniformly hoarse from too much laughter. Gasping people clap until their hands bleed while the standup comedian sticks the microphone in his mouth and imitates a blender. I can't beat that. My only hope is to do something else.</p> <p>Back in the late 1950s, when I first started paying attention to this kind of thing, there were about half a dozen people in the world who could just go on and talk. Mostly they sat on a bar stool, so it wasn't, strictly speaking, standup. Mort Sahl, my favourite, just talked about life but put a twist on it. Eventually he disappeared into the mists of conspiracy theory, but he had already been outflanked by another American, Jonathan Winters, who could use the microphone to imitate a tortoise crossing a freeway. Standup took off irretrievably into the realm of pure comedy. The subject mattered less and less, the continuous laughter more and more. You won't catch me knocking that, but you won't catch me trying it, either. I want to talk seriously. I just don't want to get lynched while I'm doing so. How to avoid that is the question.</p> <p>I started looking for the answer about 40 years ago, in Edinburgh. A Cambridge Footlights revue that I had directed was a hit on the Fringe, partly because I had been sensible enough not to include myself in the cast, who were all a lot funnier than I was. Hungry for a share of the limelight, I staged a poetry and jazz show in the afternoons, with all the jazz devoted to backing my poems and all the talking done by myself. In the evenings, our venue was packed for the revue. In the afternoons, a thin scattering turned up to hear me. They had their priorities right, but I couldn't help noticing that when I went off script and improvised, there was a rapport. The rapport was especially intense with a small woman in the third row who wore two overcoats at once and followed me around for several days reciting her own poems to me while running to keep up. I had also, however, got the occasional laugh from the normal people. Nothing to shake the rafters, but still it was heady wine.</p> <p>The addiction had taken hold, and in subsequent decades I slowly got better at holding an audience just by talking to them. The scariest part is that you can always tell when you aren't holding them. They start to cough, first individually, then in chorus. Finally they are being conducted by Toscanini. The only way to stave off the coughs is to say something interesting. For that, part of the secret is confidence. You have to believe that what you're saying is worth the crowd's time. It's a hard ask, when you consider that even Mark Antony needed Caesar's corpse for a prop. The other part of the secret is to pack the line. As on the page, what you say on stage should give value for money, bringing a lot in. I learned something about how to do that when things went haywire in the TV studio and I felt bound to keep the studio audience entertained until the glitch was repaired. A warm-up man usually does that job, but I thought we could save a salary if I did it. To my delight, I found that the audience sometimes relished what the people at home weren't getting. When I finally left mainstream television at the beginning of the current millennium, I went in search of stage audiences who might feel the same.</p> <p>One of those audiences was in Edinburgh. At the Pleasance, I did an hour with Pete Atkin, with whom I write songs. A whole new generation had grown to maturity since I was last on stage in Edinburgh. In the courtyard of the Pleasance, my daughter's boyfriend was running the World's Smallest Cinema, which could hold an audience of two people. All the same old mad stuff was happening but most of the people were different, and I wondered, when I went on for the first show, whether time hadn't left me behind. The audience in Edinburgh, if you can pull them into the tent, is in search of adventure, but there are limits - and we were a pair of old timers, neither of whom resembled Russell Brand. Yet things went gratifyingly well. It was no surprise in Pete's case: he'd been working the clubs for years. But I surprised myself out of my skin. The only man who coughed while I was talking had a genuine case of emphysema. I had no guarantee, however, that I could get away with it all on my own. </p> <p>Literary festivals supplied some of the evidence that I might. An hour on your feet at a literary festival is usually far removed from standup, and most writers very sensibly don't try to put on a show. If VS Naipaul started telling tall stories about Ravi Shankar, you'd be worried. But the opportunity to do something other than a straight reading is always there. Over the course of five years or so I tried to develop the author's standard hour into a performance. Cheltenham was a good venue for that, but the best of all, once again, was in Edinburgh, at the Book festival, where an hour in the big tent turned out to be a hot gig, as they say in the trade. Armed with this new knowledge - I won't call it expertise, because half the time I still didn't know what I was doing - I undertook a tour of Australia last year, playing a total of 30 solo dates all over the country. Finally, I went on alone at the Sydney Opera House. The joint was full and it must have worked, because next day I was still in one piece. To disappoint that many Aussies all at once is never wise.</p> <p>Time, then, to bring the idea back to where it started, under the shadow of Edinburgh Castle while the city teems with ticket-buyers and every spare room in town is a squat for the young and hungry. The only justification for taking some of their limelight is that you, too, are convinced that you are at the start of something. In the afternoons, I'll be hosting conversations on stage with some of the festival's stars, which isn't quite the cinch it looks, but after 20 years of doing the same sort of thing on television I would deserve punishment if I couldn't bring if off. In the evenings, though, I'll be going on alone. And it still feels like the start of something new. For one thing, it's something the young can't do, because they haven't lived long enough to reflect on the experience of growing older. But I'm not just after the sigh of recognition from older people in the audience when I make cracks about how I can't get out of my front door without forgetting my Freedom Pass. I want to tell the younger generation about how time will happen to them, and they're lucky if it does. Will they listen? Will they even turn up? Only one way to find out.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The One Show has been a surprise success.</strong></p> <p>I wasn't there at the beginning, but there was definitely a snobby element then - lots of people distanced themselves from the show, saying it was going to be a massive flop. But ultimately the very people saying that are the ones calling us to try to get on the show. It's swings and round-abouts, isn't it? You shouldn't be snobby on TV.</p> <p><strong>The show has been described as being patronising, a sort of TV Prozac for the nation.</strong></p> <p>Is that a bad thing? Maybe it's not. I have now become a seven-minute expert on everything: I'll know seven minutes' worth of information about badgers, frogs, the current state of tourism in Cornwall - it varies from day to day. We sit back every so often and think, \"I can't believe we're part of this.\" It's changed early- evening viewing on BBC1 to such an extent.</p> <p><strong>You have a politics degree and a good track record in television in Belfast, but when you came to the show you were seen by some as the \"beauty\" to co-presenter Adrian Chiles's \"brains\". That must have been annoying.</strong></p> <p>I shocked a lot of the team because in the studio environment I knew more than Adrian did, and that was a massive tool for me. I was able to rein him in and suddenly he realised, \"Actually she does know what she's taking about - she's not just going to sit and smile.\"</p> <p><strong>In one interview, Adrian said he first thought you were a \"dippy, nice-looking bird from Northern Ireland\" and you described him as a \"miserable fart\".</strong></p> <p>I definitely said \"miserable fart\" but he claims not to have said that. But who knows?</p> <p><strong>Does it sound like something he would say?</strong></p> <p>Possibly, yeah. I think I just bombarded him with friendly chat, and I guess I was coming from this position that if it didn't work out I was going back home again. If I came across as relaxed and dippy, fair enough - that's just me.</p> <p><strong>Are you really that enthusiastic in real life?</strong></p> <p>I think I am. Partly because I came to London to do this, on a temporary basis, not knowing one single person, and now here I am doing one of the biggest shows that has hit the BBC for years. That's a lot to take in, and I never ever take it for granted. I've done all the horrible jobs - I've made the tea, I've run after people, I've been at their beck and call - and I appreciate what the sound man has to do, I appreciate what the little runner has to do to keep everybody happy, because I've gone through the ranks. We [the presenters] get the glory of it all because we happen to be on camera, but really it's not about us - there are another 50 people behind it, and it wouldn't happen without them. I sit every night and think, \"This is incredible.\" That's where the enthusiasm comes from. It's genuinely genuine. </p> <p>I still have to pinch myself.</p> <p><strong>Much has been made of the chemistry between you and Adrian on set. Is that the success of the show?</strong></p> <p>It has to be part of it. On TV you either get slated for not having any chemistry or told off for having too much. You have to get along simply because you spend a lot of time with people. Chemistry makes it sound a little more sordid than it is, but you can be mates. We're a big sociable crowd. It's not just Adrian - the chemistry is there with our entire team. </p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the rumours about you and Adrian?</strong></p> <p>I just giggle about them - we both do. It's almost like people want it to be true. I wonder: do [This Morning presenters] Fern and Philip get this? They probably did at the beginning. It's given me a different insight into how things work over here. I guess Northern Ireland is such a small place that this would never happen because everybody knows everybody. I suppose people don't know enough about me, they don't know my background, they don't know if I'm married with kids because I've never really gone down the press route. So I can maybe understand why people want to say things, but at the same time I have to giggle about it. </p> <p><strong>I'm going to look you in the eye and ask you: are you and Adrian having an affair?</strong></p> <p>No, I am not. Bloody hell! No, I am not. [Laughs.] I'll ask him when I go back. I'll say: \"Adrian, how would you comment on that?\" No, the answer is absolutely no.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/media/audio/2008/aug/06/christine.bleakley\">Audio: Christine Bleakley talks to Hannah Pool</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Just say no!\" My response when a friend told me her boy was threatening to boomerang back into the family home was swift, loud and uncompromising. I call him a boy - I've known him almost since birth - although he's now 26 and rising, 6ft 2in tall, with a good degree from a top-class university and a new job that pays a more-than-respectable salary.</p> <p>The problem was, his adoring, but understandably apprehensive mother explained, that he had managed all right in his first job in a big, northern industrial city where rents were just about affordable, but now he was moving to the capital, where his parents still lived in the house in which he was raised. \"He can't afford anything decent in London,\" she whimpered. \"He'll have to come home.\"</p> <p>I reminded her that, when we were young, our parents had seen us through our education and then firmly washed their hands of us financially. \"Learn to stand on your own two feet,\" was their unshakable mantra and their strict moral codes would have made returning to our old single beds under their roofs unthinkable. Their methods served us well. We learned to rely on no other resources than our own.</p> <p>Our children's generation has had far too easy a ride. We've allowed double beds, let girlfriends stay the night for fear of appearing stuffy, and led the kids to believe that life without mod cons is barely worth living. Perhaps now, I suggested, was the time for them to learn that a grotty flat in a grim part of town where smalls had to be scrubbed in the sink and the scent of the downstairs burger bar was ever present (you can see I speak from experience here) might just be character-building.</p> <p>We had, of course, my friend and I, both known the agony of the emptying nest. My two are now long gone - they are 25 and 21. How we had grieved over the teddies they had left lying around their rooms. We had lain on the beds that still smelled uniquely of our beloved babes and sobbed hot tears of maternal deprivation. We had even sort of missed the girlie posters of which we had so frequently complained.</p> <p>But we had recovered quite surprisingly quickly. No more trails of droppings that signal arrival home from school. Coat on a chair. Keys on the table. Bag on the floor in a position just asking to be tripped over. Shoes the size of small ships scattered across the hallway. Drum and bass blaring from the bedroom and the first words spoken - yours - \"Turn that racket down, will you!\"</p> <p>To walk into a sitting room where the cushions were carefully plumped the night before and find it as immaculate as when you left it is a source of sheer joy. </p> <p>You can spend a whole evening in front of the telly in total control of the remote with no fear of being forced to watch Jeremy Clarkson or Pimp My Ride.</p> <p>When you go to bed, you can expect to sleep in blissful peace with no worries about why they aren't home at three o'clock in the morning. Visions of twisted metal on the motorway become a thing of the past. As a new day dawns, the bathroom towels will be neatly hung on the rail and not strewn on someone's bedroom floor. Radio 4 can be switched on with no danger of anyone being so daringly cavalier as to turn it over to Radio 1, and there will be milk left in the fridge to have with coffee. </p> <p>My friend failed to heed my advice and two years later he is still there, eating her out of house and home, bringing back a string of what she says are entirely unsuitable young women and practising his new hobby before supper - a well amplified electric guitar. When she has complained, I have shown no sympathy and simply mouthed: \"I told you so.\"</p> <p>Then, two weeks ago, my number one came home with one of those unmistakable \"I need to ask you a favour\" looks. He has, it seems, hit a temporary hiccup on the housing front and wondered if it would be OK to move back in for a short while till he could find something convenient that he could afford. It took me half a heartbeat to just say yes. Mothers, eh? Who'd trust one?</p> <p><strong>It's not nice to be out on the town on a Saturday night </strong>and watch drunken girls falling over in the street and knocking seven bells out of each other. The number of violent attacks by what are rather reductively known as ladettes is said to have doubled in the past five years and we are told that it is the first time in history that violence has been the most common crime among women and girls. </p> <p>Dame Eileen Atkins says they are a disgrace to feminism. Not so. They are an inevitable consequence of equal opportunity. These girls have been raised in a culture that has too often painted their gender as natural victims and excused bad behaviour on the male side with the four most dangerous words in the English language - boys will be boys.</p> <p>It is not nice to be out on the town on a Saturday night and watch drunken lads falling over and knocking each other about, but let's at least condemn them as heartily as we have the girls and stop expecting the female to be what Margaret Atwood called \"gooder\" simply by virtue of her sex.</p> <p><strong>This week Jenni read</strong> Sacrifice by SJ Bolton: \"A real page-turner by a new crime writer - not to be read while alone in the dark.\" <strong>She listened to</strong> Leonard and Marianne on Radio 4, hoping for a great love story: \"Cohen dumped her and her child for Suzanne.

  "<p>Unlike most 27-year-old men, Jeff Henke has never owned a videogame console. So after eight years of conscientious swotting to qualify as a doctor it came as somewhat of a shock to Jeff to learn that his homework now includes an hour a night on the Nintendo Wii. \"This isn't exactly what I pictured of when I thought of medical school,\" he says. \"But I'm not complaining.\"</p> <p>Henke is a second-year resident surgeon at the Banner Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, and for the past year he has been a willing guinea pig in a study measuring the effects on surgeon proficiency from regular gameplay on Nintendo's popular console. And the results are impressive.</p> <p>\"The surgeons develop an increased efficiency, less errors, more fluid movement - basically they're just better,\" says Dr Mark Smith, director of the hospital's Simulation Education and Training (SimET) Center. To be precise, the doctors who regularly played on the Wii scored 48% higher on tool control and performance than those who didn't.</p> <p><strong>Not all fun and games</strong></p> <p>There have been numerous studies carried out across the globe that all come to the same conclusion: surgeons who play videogames have better hand-to-eye coordination and dexterity. So does this study in Phoenix merely reiterate that point, or is there something that sets the Wii apart from the crowd?</p> <p>\"We can always tell the surgeons who are gamers, because they're naturally better,\" says Smith. (He's also keen to point out that within a very short time period, non-gamers are on a par.) \"But what we're finding with the Wii is that the surgeons that use it regularly are achieving results that far outstrip those who have just gamed before. And that's because the Wii is very different.\"</p> <p>The difference being down to the \"Wiimote\", the motion-sensitive controller that transforms real-life movements into movements on the screen. Just over a year ago, Smith's partner at the SimET Center, bioinformatics expert Dr Kanav Kahol, first started pondering the Wii's potential.</p> <p>\"The whole point about surgery is to execute small, finely controlled movements with your hands,\" says Kahol. \"Then we saw people using the Wii and noticed the precision of some movements looked very similar.\"</p> <p>Kahol and Smith rounded up 16 surgical residents, split them into two groups and started one of the groups on a strict diet of videogaming, the other being a control group. Some games proved to be of more benefit than others. \"You don't gain a lot from swinging an imaginary tennis racket,\" says Kahol.</p> <p>It soon became apparent that the game benefiting the lab rats most was Marble Mania (called Kororinpa in the UK) - a game that requires slight hand movements to guide a marble through a maze. Hand movements were tracked using a Cyberglove covered in sensors and the readouts showed the manoeuvres had a 90% correlation to those of a surgeon performing a laparoscopic surgery.</p> <p>\"Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery is a very fine art,\" says Smith. \"A laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen through small incisions. There's a camera in the probe and surgeons work off monitors. Very small instruments are used and they are controlled by the smallest of hand movements.\"</p> <p>Put like that, the similarities are not too hard to see. Additional training is obviously required to get doctors accustomed to working from a screen and using the laparoscopic instruments. Increasingly, this training is done using virtual reality machines whose value can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, only affordable to wealthier hospitals. Whereas a Wii and a copy of Kororinpa can be bought for around \u00a3200 - even less in the US.</p> <p><strong>Wii will cut you</strong></p> <p>Now the hospital has created stations where the controllers have been extended to make them feel more like probes to the user, and doctors warm up on them before going into surgery.</p> <p>And the hospital is developing its own basic games - such as picking up rings and putting them on pegs - but the movements are very sensitive. And in the next two years the team at the SimET Center hopes they will be ready for mass production. In the meantime, many in the medical world are excited about the implications of Smith and Kahol's findings.</p> <p>\"Of course there are the obvious advantages: better surgeons,\" says Susanna Barascu, a Romanian senior surgeon who has spent most of her career working in developing-world countries, with the past 10 years in Africa.</p> <p>She says: \"During minimally invasive surgeries there is reduced exposure of vital organs, meaning a reduced risk of infection. There is also reduced blood loss, meaning reduced need for transfusions. And patients can get out of hospital and back home sooner.</p> <p>\"In the countries I work in, where risk of infection is high and supply of blood and beds is short, any cheap development that can lead to fewer open procedures is incredibly exciting.\" And for those who are just embarking on their careers the excitement lies in the direction the profession is heading.</p> <p>\"The future of surgery is utilising remote onscreen technology,\" says Henke. \"But what makes it exciting are minds like Dr Kahol and Smith's, who look at everyday inexpensive technologies and think, 'How could I use that?' \"</p> <p>With such conviction and a first-hand benefactor of such thinking, one could be forgiven for thinking that Henke musts pend his evenings at home in front of his Wii honing his skills. Doesn't he?</p> <p>\"Well, I know I should really buy one for home ... but I still keep holding out hope that the hospital might give me one for 'research'.\"</p>",
  "<p>Irvine Robbins started with a single ice-cream parlour in Glendale, Calfornia, and with his brother-in-law, Burton Baskin, turned it into Baskin-Robbins, the world's biggest ice-cream chain. Robbins, who has died aged 90, was an innovator in both business and ice-cream - part of Baskins-Robbins' success was due to their being among the first franchised retailers. Robbins claimed his franchising model inspired Ray Kroc, to whom he passed it on while supplying milkshake blenders to Kroc's hamburger stands, called McDonald's. </p> <p>But Robbins' real genius lay in the marketing of ice-cream itself. More than just a food, ice-cream is the great comforter of American life, and Robbins helped turn it into a great indulgence. The explosion of Baskin-Robbins' 31 exotic flavours killed postwar America's traditional preoccupation with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry once and for all. Robbins' idea was to surprise customers with new flavours, and the idea grew into commemorative tastes, such as Baseball Nut, to celebrate the Brooklyn Dodgers moving to Los Angeles (it came complete with a strawberry - slang for a derisory cheer - for the umpires), Cocoa A Go Go to celebrate the twist, Beatle Nut, when the Fab Four arrived in New York in 1964, and Lunar Cheesecake, to commemorate the moon landings. He also concocted such staples as Rocky Road, pink bubblegum and, his personal favourite, Jamoca almond fudge.</p> <p>Robbins was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to parents who had emigrated from eastern Europe. His father moved the family to Tacoma, Washington, and went into the dairy business with his brother. Irvine began working in the retail store attached to the dairy. A naturally exuberant person who became a cheerleader at his new high school by jumping off a balcony while leading the school yell, Robbins was taken with the pleasure that scoops of ice-cream brought his customers, and quickly realised a little exuberance could help sales. The standard banana split became a \"Super Banana Treat\", and bright signs marked each sundae on offer.</p> <p>He graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Washington in 1939, returned to the family business and married Irma Gevurtz. He served in the army during the second world war and, after his discharge, cashed in an insurance policy he had received for his bar mitzvah, moved to Glendale and opened the Snowbird ice-cream store. Baskin, who had married Robbins' sister, had run a clothing store in Chicago before the war, but after his discharge from the navy, followed Robbins, and opened his Burton's Ice Cream in nearby Pasadena. Robbins' father had advised against the brothers-in-law going into business together, lest they inhibit each other's ideas.</p> <p>But by 1948 there were five Snowbird stores, and three Burton's, and the brothers-in-law decided to merge. With the merger came their 31st flavour, chocolate mint, which gave them one for every day of the month (vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry were never counted among the 31). It would also be three more than Howard Johnson's, who famously offered 28. Within a year they were up to 43 stores, growing quickly after deciding to sell each store to its manager, what would come to be known as \"franchising\". They renamed the company, with a coin-toss deciding that Baskin's name would come first.</p> <p>Soon they were out of the managing business, producing ice-cream at a factory in Burbank, concentrating on the standardised look of the stores and a constant churning of the flavours they sold. Overall, more than 1,000 flavours have filled the scoops of Baskin-Robbins stores, and employees have always been allowed to eat as much as they like, because, as Robbins said, \"I don't want my employees stealing.\"</p> <p>In 1967, the partners sold their business, by then some 500 stores, to United Fruit for $12m. The premium ice-cream business took off as baby-boomers reached adulthood. Within six months, Baskin had died, aged 54, of a heart attack. Robbins worked for the company until retiring in 1978. It is now owned by Dunkin' Donuts, and boasts some 5,500 stores worldwide. Robbins was an ardent anglophile, and an unlikely supporter of Newcastle United, but his Grape Britain ice cream, perhaps fortunately, never left the laboratory.</p> <p>Robbins retired to Rancho Mirage, his house equipped with a six-seat soda fountain, where he ate three or four scoops daily, frequently adding banana ice cream to his breakfast cereal. </p> <p>He is survived by Irma, daughters Marsha and Erin, and son John, who rejected the family business, became a vegan, and is the author of Diet for a New America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Irvine Robbins, businessman, born December 6 1917; died May 5 2008</p>",
  "<p>Millions of people log on to social networking sites everyday, all sharing one thing in common: we're all going to die. What will become of our online lives?</p> <p>In almost every case, profiles of the dead are left suspended in mid-air, open to unmoderated comments, spam and even pornography. Today on Facebook, one such profile reads: \"Andrew has no recent activity.\" He died last year.</p> <p>Looking at his profile, though, you wouldn't know. You can still request to be his friend, send him a message and, of course, poke him.</p> <p>Further down his page, there is a close-up of a pair of barely covered breasts. The picture, generated by the third-party application FunWall, was posted without Andrew's consent. Other pictures and video from applications can include pictures of deformed genitals and assorted sexual acts.</p> <p>Any wall comments made on Andrew's profile appear immediately. Fortunately, the comments are all positive. But this isn't always the case.</p> <p>MySpace, the biggest social network, has made headlines when profiles of the deceased have been made public. Famously, the case of 17-year-old Joshua Anson Ballard, who in 2005 posted his own suicide note as a MySpace bulletin, revealed just how emotionally charged a remembrance profile can become.</p> <p><strong>Gone but not logged off <br></strong><br>While MySpace users have control over who their friends are, they have less control over what their friends actually do. Phishing attacks have lead to spam comment posts from friends appearing on profiles without either user's knowledge. Typical posts will invite people to adult sites, or to buy drugs.</p> <p>Administrators say they treat death on a case-by-case basis, but there are limited options. \"MySpace never deletes a profile for inactivity,\" the site says. \"However, if a family requests that a profile be removed we will honour their request and remove the profile in question.</p> <p>\"MySpace does not allow anyone to assume control of a deceased user's profile and, as with any profile in our network, the memorial profile must abide by our terms of use.\"</p> <p>So, the option is either to leave a profile untouched, open to unmoderated comments, or to remove it completely.</p> <p>LinkedIn, a social network for professionals, has a clear policy on user death: at the family's request, the profile is simply removed. \"We first of all offer our condolences and then proceed to close their account so their details are no longer visible to anyone,\" says Cristina Hoole of LinkedIn. \"Our focus is on making this process very simple for the people left behind and therefore ensure this is dealt with immediately.\"</p> <p>She says that there have been no instances of abuse on this system, but agrees that is probably down to LinkedIn's more mature user base when compared to other networks.</p> <p>Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/\">LiveJournal</a>, a veteran of social networking, has it right. For deceased users, a special memorial status has been implemented, which in effect freezes the profile - but leaves it there to be enjoyed without fear of it being hijacked or spammed. The user's friends can - if the family wishes - continue to read all the existing journal entries.</p> <p>\"This status is typically applied at the request of a family member,\" explains Tim Smith of LiveJournal. \"The support team then does its best to be reasonably sure that the person is truly deceased. Ordinarily, they get those assurances from simple things such examining the account activity or looking for comments to the journal which would be consistent with the journal owner being deceased.\"</p> <p>But Smith says that this isn't an actual written policy, rather a process that has gradually emerged over time. \"I wish I could point you to a formal, written policy on the site,\" he adds. \"But this has been a case where the practice from the support team has emerged over time more from a combination of common sense and common decency.\"</p> <p>Perhaps one group that could best handle a users death would be the <a href=\"http://openid.net/\">OpenID project</a>, which aims to provide one single login for various sites. By notifying OpenID of a user death, more than 4,000 sites, including MySpace, could be informed at once.<br><strong><br>Online lives - and deaths</strong></p> <p>Bill Washburn, executive director of OpenID, says such a scheme would depend on the co-operation of each individual site, and believes it will take a high-profile court case to bring the issue to the web's full attention. \"There will be some set of judicial cases that get decided as to what is and isn't necessary and appropriate,\" he says.</p> <p>He is concerned that the decision of what should be done with our online lives may not even be ours to make.</p> <p>\"We sit in a fairly unequal place with respect to what websites can do and what individuals can do on the net. And that will only get more and more attention. End users don't fully own their identity.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling knows it. Mervyn King knows it. The period of steady growth and low inflation that began in 1992 on the day that Britain was forced out of the exchange rate mechanism is over, and neither the chancellor nor the governor of the Bank of England needed last night's fourpenn'orth from the International Monetary Fund to tell them that these are difficult times.</p> <p>Indeed, the IMF's health check on the UK only served to underline what Darling and King have been saying for some time. The combination of a credit crunch, a deflating housing bubble and spiralling food and energy prices means that the outlook for growth is much lower and inflation higher than the Treasury was forecasting in the spring budget. For the first time since it was elected in May 1997 Labour is beset by the sort of tough economic climate that was part of everyday life for Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. For the first time since it was granted operational independence five days after Tony Blair's first landslide victory, the credibility of the Bank of England is at stake when it meets to decide interest rates today.</p> <p>Creating the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC), and ceding to it the power to set the cost of borrowing, was seen as a masterstroke by Gordon Brown and for 10 years the liberated Bank had it easy. It was, as King put it, a \"nice\" decade of \"non-inflationary continual expansion\" in which globalisation helped keep prices low and output high. Monetary policy became a technocratic affair: the MPC experts giving the odd tweak here and there in order to hit the government's inflation target.</p> <p>When the MPC met in August 2007, days before the credit crisis began, it spoke with one voice. All nine members said the rate should be left at 5.75% following five quarter-point increases, but the City was put on alert for further rises should the economy fail to slow. There was a reference to market tremors but nothing to suggest that August 9 2007 would end the recovery that began for the UK on September 16 1992.</p> <p>Life has moved on. With the economy facing the twin perils of recession and inflation, last month's MPC meeting showed it was split three ways. One member, David Blanchflower, said lower rates were necessary to prevent Britain following the US into a housing market-led downturn. Blanchflower has been a lone voice on the MPC in recent months, but he is supported by economists who believe that higher food and fuel prices will ultimately prove deflationary rather than inflationary because of their impact on consumer spending power. </p> <p>A former MPC member, Sushil Wadhwani, criticised the Bank yesterday for failing to \"lean against the wind\" when the housing market was booming out of control and for now failing to provide a parachute when the economy was coming rapidly back to earth.</p> <p>Another MPC member, Tim Besley, sees things differently. He voted to raise rates last month on the grounds that it would signal that the Bank had gone soft on inflation if it ignored the fact that the government's target was being missed by an ever-wider margin. Besley takes the stitch-in-time approach: it is better to raise interest rates a little bit rather than risk having to raise them a lot later should inflation get out of control. The other seven members decided to let things be last month, though some share Blanchflower's concern about doing too little too late to prevent a recession and some would have joined Besley in voting for higher rates had they not feared taking the financial markets by surprise.</p> <p>King knows his second term at the helm in Threadneedle Street, which began last month, will be more challenging than the first. At a press conference in May to launch the Bank's quarterly inflation report, he said: \"The monetary policy committee is facing its most difficult challenge yet. For the time being, at least, the 'nice' decade is behind us. The credit cycle has turned. Commodity prices are rising. We are travelling along a bumpy road as the economy rebalances. Monetary policy cannot, and should not try to, prevent that adjustment.\"</p> <p>King's message is that we must grin and bear it. Should wage bargainers seek compensation for higher inflation by securing higher pay deals, the Bank will push up interest rates. The threat - unspoken but real - is that the Bank will use higher unemployment to return inflation to its 2% target if it must.</p> <p>The Bank's concern is that the government's preferred measure of inflation has been rising steadily over the past year, up from 1.8% last August to 3.8% last month, and is certain to go still higher as the 35% increase in domestic energy bills takes effect. City analysts believe the peak will be close to 5% this autumn.</p> <p>If this scenario had been unfolding a year ago, the MPC would now be raising rates aggressively. Yet, as the IMF noted last night, Britain is in the grip of a credit crunch that has put intense strain on the financial markets, savaged the housing market and sharply reduced the outlook for growth. Most City analysts believe rates will stay on hold until later this year, by when inflation should have peaked. But lower interest rates take time to work - an uncomfortable prospect for a government 20 points behind in the polls and with an election less than two years away - and in the meantime the stimulus for the economy is coming from higher borrowing rather than cheaper borrowing. The IMF said last night that the UK would grow by 1.4% this year and 1.1% next: many City economists believe the outlook for 2009 is even worse than that.</p>",
  "<p>Yes. Actually, no. Oh, okay then, yeah ... but no. What are we talking about? NetShare, the \u00a36 App Store ex-download that's confused many an iPhone owner this past week.</p> <p>NetShare appeared on Apple's App Store last Thursday. It granted iPhiles the ability to turn the God phone into a modem, wirelessly tethered to a notebook (OK, a MacBook) - thus allowing it to do what pretty much every other Godless phone can do already.</p> <p>And then, 20 minutes later, NetShare disappeared from App Store. The hand of God? Well, it was Apple that took it down.</p> <p>Then, just a couple of hours later, and without explanation, NetShare was back online for purchase. Only not readily - searching for \"NetShare\" on App Store would have got you nowhere. No, you needed a find a special link to the NetShare download on App Store.</p> <p>Fortunately, the internets are good at looking for things and an unquantifiable number of folk paid for and downloaded NetShare. Including Guardian Technology. For our \u00a35.99, we have an iPhone-powered Wi-Fi hotspot. We've even got it working with PCs. It's great.</p> <p>And then, the next day, Apple pulled NetShare again, and permanently. Well, as permanent as the deadline for this piece, anyway. Why? We think because such a tool might - might - contravene the terms and conditions of Apple's various carriers, who wouldn't want the iPhone muscling in on their valuable mobile broadband tariffs.</p> <p>To check our thinking, we asked Apple. The company said: . (No, that's not a typing error. It's a colon, then a space followed by a full stop. The space summarises Apple's indifference to questioning by anyone, let alone the press.)</p> <p>So we asked the company behind NetShare - <a href=\"http://www.nullriver.com/\">Nullriver</a>. It said: \"We've talked to Apple. It is working to try to get NetShare back online. We can only guess [that its removal from App Store] has to do with carrier agreements. Apple provided very little information.\"</p> <p>NetShare might be App Store history. But Guardian Technology is still running a NetShare-powered Wi-Fi hotspot on an iPhone connected to the O2 network. Is this OK? We thought we'd better ask O2. It said: . Ah, sorry, that was an editing oversight. Here's what O2 told us: \"Use of the NetShare application would infringe the terms of service for iPhone 3G customers. O2's [terms and conditions] specifically say that the Sim card may not be used in, or connected to, any other devices including modems.\"</p> <p>Oh dear. Apple has allowed an application to be sold on its App Store that violates the terms and conditions of its sole UK carrier. This means some people have paid money via Apple's App Store for an application that they cannot legitimately use on their Apple product.</p> <p>Will Apple be issuing refunds to these customers? We asked Apple. It replied: .</p>",
  "<p>President Pervez Musharraf decided last night to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic games in Beijing, but not without some trepidation at leaving the country. The newspaper Dawn reported that the leaders of the two biggest parties in Pakistan's ruling coalition were coming close to an agreement on a course that would lead to his ousting or to his impeachment, and for a while it looked as if the trip was off.</p> <p>Mr Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif, one of the two leaders involved in the impeachment move, have a history of toppling each other. The president has only to think back to October 12 1999, when Mr Sharif, then prime minister, dismissed General Musharraf as head of the army while he was out of the country. What followed Mr Musharraf's dramatic landing at Karachi airport, when he got the army to unblock the runway as his plane was running out of fuel, was a military coup. What could happen now may not be that different, and both men may be motivated by revenge - Mr Musharraf for the drubbing he received in the elections in February, and Mr Sharif for 1999.</p> <p>This is a country where vendettas are played out against a wider security landscape. For all the euphoria that followed the crushing defeat of parties loyal to the president in February, the coalition government of Yousuf Gilani, the prime minister, has run into the sands. Food prices are soaring, a war with militants is raging, relations with India have plunged (again) and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, accused by Afghanistan and India of helping the Taliban bomb the Indian embassy in Kabul, appears a law unto itself. </p> <p>After just six weeks in office, the coalition between the Pakistan Peoples party and Mr Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (N) all but collapsed over the issue of how to reinstate the judges sacked by Mr Musharraf. The fate of the sacked justices is linked inextricably to the president's, because it was the supreme court's determination to pursue the circumstances of the president's re-election last year that led to the court's dismissal. </p> <p>If the PPP and PML-N heal their rift over the reinstatement of the judges, Mr Musharraf may yet face his nemesis. But the country is weaker than it was to cope with the consequences of domestic crisis. There are many unknowns. Will the army take sides? Will the president's supporters engage the services of the ISI, whose cause they have been championing in parliament? Mr Musharraf said he would not use presidential powers to dismiss parliament, but there is all manner of proxy force available to those intent on destabilising democracy. Day by day, the self-serving argument that Pakistan can not function under civilian rule advances its cause.</p>",
  "<h2>Case aborted after jury plans own investigation</h2> <p>The trial of a man charged with murdering a Sydney model in 1995 was aborted yesterday after the judge said there was evidence some jurors had planned to hold an independent investigation into the case. Justice Graham Barr said one juror told a journalist last week that some jurors were planning to hold a private inspection of the site where Caroline Byrne died, a cliff face near Sydney Harbour . A 1998 inquest into her death said that she may have jumped, fallen or been pushed to her death. But a 2005 investigation recommended that Byrne's ex-boyfriend, Gordon Wood, be charged with her murder. <br><strong>Associated Press in Sydney</strong></p> <h2>'Human eye' camera breakthrough for robots</h2> <p>Scientists in the US have produced a prototype \"human eye\" camera like the watchful computer in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey that could revolutionise photography and possibly robot technology. The device, the size and shape of an eye, has a light-sensitive curved \"retina\", capable of sharper images and a wider field of view than current flat surface photo-detectors used in digital cameras. The journal Nature reported yesterday that the electronics were built on to a stretched out elastic membrane which was then allowed to spring back to its original curved shape. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>10-month-old boy killed in drive-by shooting</h2> <p>A 10-month-old baby was shot dead in his car seat during a drive-by shooting in Puerto Rico, police said yesterday.

  "<p>Just like blades, phrases can be blunted by overuse. Talk of avoiding \"catastrophic climate change\" is so familiar, the words no longer instantly stir up apocalyptic images. But in the light of remarks from Defra's chief scientific adviser, it is worth recalling what would be involved. As the Guardian reports today, Professor Bob Watson says Britain must prepare for an increase in temperatures of 4C - a rise deep in catastrophe territory. Even at 3C between a fifth and a half of all species would face extinction. At 4C some human populations could be heading the same way. Swaths of Africa and the Mediterranean would be parched of water and see food production decimated. Over the decades, melting polar ice sheets would increase sea levels to the point where whole island nations - not to mention parts of Britain - would be smothered. The release of CO2 could spiral beyond human control if the heat stopped natural forest fires from burning themselves out. In the darkest scenario, civilisation would be on the slipway to oblivion.</p> <p>Mercifully, that is far from certain - but with warming in excess of 2C very little is. Is Prof Watson encouraging fatalistic acceptance of it? Emphatically not. His responsibilities include advising not just on climate policy, but also flood defences. And the only responsible way to plan coastal barriers is on the basis of an honest appraisal of what the future could bring - however depressing that may be. In line with the Stern report and the IPCC, Prof Watson believes all governments should seek to contain global warming to 2C. He merely acknowledges that the chance that this target will not be met is too real to be ignored.</p> <p>That is putting it mildly. Even if global emissions could be stabilised at current levels, a rise in excess of 2C would be a substantial possibility. Indeed it might become a probability if China and India follow the west and clean up their industry to tackle acid rain. (The sulphurous gases which cause that problem also offset global warming by reflecting sunlight.) Instead of stabilising, however, emissions continue to rise, and the political obstacles on turning the tide remain formidable. The passing of George W Bush next year will remove only one of several. The US is now so far above Kyoto baselines, that even when a more constructive president takes over - as either candidate would prove - they may demand a deal that takes account of this catastrophic starting point. But other countries who have been working to cut emissions might resist this as a reward for failure. There will be other sticking points, too. China is now the world's biggest emitter, so no meaningful deal can exclude it. But there is scope for argument about whether galloping emissions from the workshop of the world are the responsibility of the Chinese producers or the western consumers they serve. A recent report by the Stockholm Environment Institute has underlined this point.</p> <p>The Stern report established that - from the point of view of the global economy - prevention is cheaper than cure. For individual countries, however, who consider the calculus in isolation, the balance will often be reversed. After all, even with a sizable economy such as Britain, whatever sacrifices are made to cut emissions the direct effect on the global emissions - and thus the climate - will be marginal, and self-interest starts to dictate a strategy of mitigating catastrophe instead. </p> <p>Prof Watson acknowledges this miserable - yet hard - logic by suggesting preparations be set in train for a rise of up to 4C. But he rightly argues that rich countries can still recast the logic through coordinated action. A joint agreement to find a way of making carbon capture work, and to fund it, would be a first step. Every country could argue that the vast funds involved are unaffordable. Each, however, is one part of the same planet - and it can no longer afford delay.</p>",
  "<h2>Steeplechase</h2> <p>I am soaking wet from head to toe, and a spider is crawling up my arm. \"There's a spider on me,\" I whine to my coach, Stella Bandu. \"Deal with it,\" she snaps. \"You're harsh,\" I say. She laughs. \"Sometimes you need to be,\" she says. </p> <p>Steeplechase is a 3km race around a track, and involves clearing 28 hurdles as well as jumping into water. I reckon I could run 3km, at a push, and how hard can it be to jump over a few things along the way? Exhaustingly hard, as it turns out. </p> <p>We are at the Julie Rose stadium in Ashford, Kent, and Stella has been coaching women's steeplechase since 2001. \"I think we'll get you started on the child's hurdles,\" she says. I should be humiliated, but I am relieved. They are about one-and-a-half feet high and I clear them no problem. She inches the hurdles up until they are high enough to cause anxiety as I run at them (they are still lower than the 76cm hurdles the Olympic women clear). We do the drills - such as scissoring over them starting with alternate legs - that Olympic steeplechasers do.</p> <p>There are several explanations for the origins of the event. My favourite comes from 1850 when an Oxford undergraduate, Halifax Wyatt, was thrown off his horse during the equine </p> <p>steeplechase and exclaimed: \"Rather than climb back on that damned 'camel', I should prefer to run those two miles on foot!\" And so he did. Steeplechase - for men - appeared at the Olympics in 1900 but this is the first year women can compete. \"People didn't think 'delicate' women were up to doing steeplechase,\" says Stella, grimacing. </p> <p>In the 3km steeplechase, athletes have to tackle the water jump seven times. Stella makes me walk all the way in - it is 70cm deep and freezing - then try to run out of the water as it slopes back up to the track. \"See how hard that is? So, when you jump over it, ideally you should clear the water. Or only one foot should land in it.\" </p> <p>I take my first run up to the bar (at 70cm, it is only about 6cm lower than the Olympic standard). It is terrifying but I manage to jump up on to it with one foot, and push myself off. I land in the water, fall over and swallow a mouthful of steeplechase stew. A film of dead insects floats on the surface. I lie there, dripping wet (proper steeplechasers only get their feet and ankles wet, if at all) as Stella tells me to get back up and try again. </p> <p>I could clear 28 (children's) hurdles, but if I had to run 3km and do the water jump seven times, I worked out that it would take me at least 45 minutes (including rest periods). The women's world record is just over nine minutes, held by Gulnara Samitova-Galkina from Russia.</p> <p> There are two women representing Britain at the Olympics in steeplechase - Helen Clitheroe and Barbara Parker. Athletes, I salute you. You have no fear of competition from me.<br><strong>Emine Saner</strong> </p> <h2>Front crawl</h2> <p>The Crowne Plaza hotel, Heathrow, is a rather unexpected place in which to find yourself having a swimming lesson on a rainy Sunday evening. But I have threaded my way through the crowds of uniformed cabin crew to this diminutive pool because it is the London outpost of the Karen Pickering swim school, run by the former medal-winner, and I want to train with someone who has some idea of what Olympic swimming involves. </p> <p>My teacher, Shelley Cizek, swam her first race, the 50m butterfly, aged four, and then went on to compete for Zimbabwe at the Junior All-Africa games. Now 31, she hasn't given up on appearing at the Olympics - though she accepts it will have to be as a coach. I am a swimmer of a somewhat different calibre. It's not that I can't swim - I love it, actually, and feel thirsty for a pool if I haven't been in one for a while - but it's been more than 20 years since I was required to achieve anything more than 30 or 40 lengths, at gentle cruising speed.</p> <p>Cizek asks me to do a few warm-up lengths and then a two-length, timed sprint. The 50m freestyle is the shortest competitive length; generally it's done in two 25m lengths, but Olympic pools are 50m long, so that's only one (which makes a difference to times because being able to give yourself a good push off the wall halfway shortens them). The current 50m freestyle female record, 23.97 seconds, was set by Australian Libby Trickett in March. I do it in 27.44 seconds - which feels brilliant, until I realise that this pool is only 16m long, and I've only really done 32m. My time over 50m at that average speed would be just over 40 seconds. Not quite so great.</p> <p>But Cizek is bullish. \"I reckon we can bring it down to at least 25. OK?\" She doesn't seem too shocked by my front crawl, either. She even uses the word \"nice\". And then - very nicely - she takes it apart. I need to kick quicker, and more from my hips. \"All your strength is coming from your arms, which is fine in distance swimming, but when it comes to sprinting, you need to go to your legs.\" My head's too high, which increases drag. My arms are generally all right, but I only breathe on one side. Lots of people do this, as it is easier, but it unbalances both your body and your stroke. </p> <p>So we work on one thing at a time. Slowing my stroke down, kicking quicker, pushing off harder, even a butterfly kick underwater - all of that is more or less OK. But breathing on both sides? My spluttering attempts cause peals of laughter. </p> <p>And these are just the bare necessities. Every single muscle flicker must be perfect, and second nature, for a swimmer to have a chance at the Olympics. Britain's women's team has cameras underwater to analyse every stage of their stroke. They use Aquapacers, which fit under their swimming caps and beep a training pace, like a metronome. Swimmers train for five hours a day, spending 25 hours a week in the water. </p> <p>Even at my level I realise, pretty quickly, that working on technique can cause a marked improvement - but that's not enough. Speed, in the end, comes down to pure power, and it's infuriating how fast I run into the limits of my breath and strength. The GB women's team do three hour-long weight sessions and a couple of hours of circuits a week (core stability, sit ups, press-ups); sprint swimmer Mark Foster spends about half of his training time in the gym. </p> <p>I prepare to do a second timed swim, dive start and all. \"Ready?\" asks Cizek. \"Take your marks. Go! Go, go, go, go, go!\" I come in at 25.61 seconds, nearly two seconds faster. And I get a small, thrilling sense of why you might want to come back for more.<br><strong>Aida Edemariam</strong></p> <h2>Shot put</h2> <p>The launching of the shot into the air and its return to earth almost on my toes still haunts me. The worst throw in the entire school year - 2.21m - met with a look of complete contempt from my PE teacher.</p> <p>Hurling a 7.26kg (16lb) ball of lead as far as you can appears to be a crude test of brute force. Weeds will always be hopeless at shot put. Wrong. Well, sort of. At the desolate Crystal Palace athletics track, Mike Winch explains how shot put is actually a supremely technical event. \"You're in a 7ft circle. You're starting at 0mph. You're jumping across the circle and letting go of the shot. The shot comes out of your hand at 40mph,\" he says. \"That's faster than a sprinter out of the blocks. It's the most explosive, aggressive event you can do.\"</p> <p>The chief coach of England's athletics team at the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth games, Winch was a shot-putter in the Geoff Capes era. \"He was a big bastard, I'm a small bastard and we had lots of good competitions together,\" he says.</p> <p>By small, Winch means 16st of muscle packed into a 5ft 11in frame. Capes, the famous World's Strongest Man winner, was 6ft 5in and 23st. It should have been no contest, but Winch's clever technique won him two Commonwealth games silver medals. \"It takes eight to 10 years to teach someone to throw properly,\" he reckons.</p> <p>Soldiers enjoyed rock-throwing competitions during the siege of Troy. Shot put is also descended from stone-lifting in Scotland, and Henry VIII was a champion at hurling weights. (When someone beat him, he banned it.) The men's world record is 23m, but these days Britain is \"pretty crap\", says Winch - our shot-putters have to juggle day jobs with training (unlike well-funded sprinters) and there's a chronic shortage of international coaches.</p> <p>No British men or women have qualified for Beijing. Could I? Winch hands me the shot. It nearly breaks my fingers when I tuck it into my shoulder.</p> <p>\"The weight is resting on my neck,\" I complain.</p> <p>\"That's because you've got no muscles in your shoulders,\" replies Winch in a tough-love kind of way. \"With five years' weight training you could be 17st and then I'd have you throwing discus 50m.\"</p> <p>Shot put is about a continuum of power: rotating yourself from a near crouching position so your acceleration begins in your thigh muscles, passes through your midriff and then your shoulders and fingers, which launch the shot into the air.</p> <p>\"It's a lovely feeling - letting go of the shot and finishing and the shot is still in the air,\" says Winch. \"The great throws are the easiest. Because your sequential development of power is so good, by the time you let go the shot feels as light as a feather.\"</p> <p>The basic technique - no gliding or spinning here - is actually a hugely complicated piece of coordination. I'm always forgetting something: not turning my back leg, lifting my back leg, not opening up my hips, not launching the shot at 42\u00b0, or falling out of the circle and disqualifying myself.</p> <p>As a final encouragement, Winch tells me the story of a pill-popping 1970s American putter. \"His saying was, 'You've got to put the shot through the hole in the sky.'\" Winch ponders this. \"He was probably on LSD at the time.\"</p> <p>Hole in the sky, hole in the sky. I twizzle for my final throw. It is hardly a moment of transcendence but for a brief second the shot sails skywards. It lands just about 4m away. In one hour, Winch has masterminded my 100% improvement. Only another 19m to go and he will have another champion on his hands.<br><strong>Patrick Barkham</strong></p> <h2>Fencing</h2> <p>\"See? It's perfectly safe,\" says John \"Jes\" Smith, thwocking a sabre hard against my helmet. Inside, my head judders. I am at the University of London fencing club, and around me students are dancing about in fetching white knickerbockers, cutting and parrying and lunging, as Smith, a diploma'd Master of the British Academy of Fencing, talks me through the rudiments of the sport. There are three types of weapon: the foil, which is light and designed for thrusting, its target confined to the torso; the sabre, which is similarly light but, unlike the foil, the side of the blade may also be used and the target is anywhere above the waist; and the epee, which is heavy, and the target is every part of the body.</p> <p>A bout lasts three minutes. At the Olympics, you fence to 15 hits within three periods of three minutes with two breaks. Competitors are wired up, and the floor is insulated so that when they hit their opponent, a light comes on and a point is scored. If both fencers hit at the same time, it is the fencer on the offensive who gets the point. \"In fencing, it's the actual offensive action that counts,\" explains Smith. \"It's about being a move ahead.\" </p> <p>Fencing is one of the four sports to have been featured at every modern Olympics, though it has never been a particularly big event (at the 1896 Olympics, there was no bronze medal as there were only two contestants) and it rarely gets much TV coverage. We have three fencers at the Olympics this year: Richard Kruse in the Men's Foil, Alex O'Connell in the Men's Sabre and Martina Emanuel in the Women's Foil. \"Europe, being the home of fencing, has all the best fencers,\" Smith informs me. O'Connell, first to qualify for Team GB, is a second-year classics student at Cambridge. In preparation for the Olympics he has put in 15 hours' training and 10 hours' commuting to training each week, alongside his 40 hours of academic work. He began fencing at seven, when he realised he would never make the school football team, started competing at nine and was on the international circuit at 11. </p> <p>There is an awful lot of kit involved, even before you get to the knickerbockers: a protective sleeve for your fencing arm, a plastic breast plate, a lame jacket. You also wear a mask that makes you look like a beekeeper and really messes up your hair. Actually I really like wearing the mask; it makes you feel invincible.</p> <p>Much of the art of fencing involves footwork. Placing one foot forward and the other at right angles, you have to bend your knees and sink low. \"Fencing,\" Smith tells me as I adopt the pose, \"is very good for the thighs and the glutes.\" Maintaining this position, you place your non-weapon hand on your hip and do a little crab-like shuffle, keeping low to the ground. Occasionally you lunge forward, or leap back. All the while, you keep an eye on the handle of your opponent's weapon to try and guess which way they plan to move. \"It's like a very fast game of scissors, paper, stone,\" says Smith, \"a very rapid game of bluff.\"</p> <p>The first time another blade strikes yours is rather terrifying, but after a short while you begin to learn the tricks: protecting your head, angling the blade, double bluffing. The movements are quick, contained and precise; there is no Hollywood swashbuckling. It is, however, extremely athletic, and even in my relatively sedate introduction, I am soon sweltering beneath my heavy kit as I block and thrust and leap and shuffle and aim my sabre at Smith's head, hoping for revenge.<br><strong>Laura Barton</strong></p> <h2>Gymnastics</h2> <p>\"Let me see you do a cartwheel,\" says Shirley Callaghan, head coach at the Ladywell gymnastics club, in Bellingham. Given it is at least 10 years, probably nearer 20, since I've attempted a cartwheel, I warn Callaghan it is not going to be pretty. With as much gusto as I can muster, I throw myself at the floor. \"That's not too bad. By the end of this session I'll have you cartwheeling off the competition-level beam,\" says Callaghan confidently. </p> <p>Used by the ancient Greeks as a way of preparing soldiers for battle, gymnastics is one of the nine sports on the original programme set up by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1896 (along with athletics, cycling, fencing, weightlifting, shooting, swimming, tennis and wrestling). The IOC describes the discipline as \"a perfect fusion of athletics and aesthetics\". And yet, despite its ancient pedigree, gymnastics, especially the women's disciplines, is often dismissed as a frilly distraction between the \"real\" sporting events. </p> <p>In today's games, gymnastics is divided into three categories: artistic, which includes floor exercises and equipment such as the beam, bars and the vault; rhythmic (which uses hoops, ribbons and balls and is done only by women); and the trampoline. </p> <p>My career as a gymnast was short-lived. I won a couple of Baga badges in primary school, did a bit more at secondary school and then the double whammy of puberty and lack of discipline meant my time as a practising gymnast was pretty much over by 14. Before I attempt anything more elevated Callaghan makes me cartwheel repeatedly along a 4in white line painted on the floor. This is supposed to make my cartwheel straighter, and, I imagine, inspire confidence. It seems to be doing neither, but Callaghan is undeterred. </p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, she places a floor-level beam in front of what looks like a large pool filled with foam squares and tells me to cartwheel off the beam and into the foam. After a couple of false starts (I lose my bottle, convinced I will knock myself out), I manage it. It's a slow cartwheel and it's lacking in grace, but I am unscathed and it gives me heaps of confidence. For the next 20 minutes I keep on cartwheeling into the pit, perfecting my technique, with Callaghan giving instructions at the sidelines: \"Tuck your head in, keep your core muscles strong, snap your legs together at the top, twist your hips at the end.\" There is so much to remember, and throwing yourself around is surprisingly tiring. I had never before thought of gymnastics as an endurance event, but after an hour I'm out of breath and sweating profusely.</p> <p>\"It would depend on the individual athlete but high-level gymnasts would probably train for two four-hour sessions, six days a week,\" says Callaghan. Of course, they don't just have to the beam to worry about: they've also got to master the vault, the asymmetric bars and a floor routine. Callaghan considers gymnastics woefully underrated in this country. \"It's a great base for all sports,\" she says. Does she think we have any chance of a medal for gymnastics? \"If we win a medal it will be wonderful for the sport,\" says Callaghan, diplomatically.</p> <p>Now my moment of reckoning has come: it's time to attempt the competition beam. I walk up and down - and soon fall off. First fall over with, I start \"prepping\" - marking out where my feet need to be to ensure I don't run out of beam mid-cartwheel. Callaghan is patient, encouraging and enthusiastic. I trust her implicitly, and when she tells me I can do it, I believe her. I take a deep breath, swing my arms to get momentum, and go for it. The next thing I know, I'm sitting on a mat on the floor, looking up at the end of the beam thinking, \"Wow, I did it.\" I am ridiculously pleased with myself. I may have missed out on Beijing, but London 2012 seems a distinct possibility.<br><strong>Hannah Pool</strong></p> <h2>Rowing</h2> <p>So here I am, sitting nervously in a racing scull in the middle of the Thames outside the venerable Mortlake Anglian &amp; Alpha boat club, going nowhere. The thing is, the slightest movement sends its insanely skinny hull skidding straight out from under you; essay even half a gentle stroke and unless your blades enter and leave the water at exactly the same moment, precisely the right angle, you'll be over. Simple as that, really. It's rather disconcerting.</p> <p>Until then, I'd been doing pretty well: 15 minutes on the erg, or indoor rowing machine, to sort out the basic action (\"Legs, body, hands,\" says George, patiently, \"then hands, body, legs going forward\"); a good session on the water in a reassuringly broad-beamed two-man skiff with veteran Dick in the bow and Ian Roots, coach to the stars, instructing me further from the stern; then half an hour on my own in a specially stabilised training scull.</p> <p>There's an awful lot to think about in rowing. I learned to drop the blades in vertically at the catch; to draw them smoothly through the water using your legs and body on the drive; flick them out cleanly at the finish; and feather them neatly so they lie flat to the water as you slide forward on the recovery. I'd even learned, sort of, to relax, which is apparently the most important thing of all. Ian, who has coached national champions, international medallists and future Olympic squad members, professed himself very pleased.</p> <p>It was more than 25 years since I had last rowed, in a much bigger boat, an eight, in my first term at university. I had never before sat in a scull. Now, though, I really was enjoying it. Rowing is at once the most technical and the most natural of sports. Getting it right may depend on the perfect alignment of countless minutiae, but you know instantly when you have got it right because you can just feel it - fluid, easy, almost effortless (though rowing uses 86% of your muscles, and when you do it in anger it hurts like hell).</p> <p>But then Ian took the stabilising floats off the trainer, and my world view changed. Suddenly, the boat was a live thing. And the boat I was in was infinitely more stable than a real racing scull. That is an elegant 27ft long, and a terrifying 12in wide, which basically means you're sitting on it, not in it, and all that keeps you from falling over are your oars. Since you're going to have to move those oars fairly energetically if you want to actually go anywhere, not taking an involuntary swim is a major achievement in itself.</p> <p>In the real thing, I got absolutely nowhere. In the de-stabilised training scull, with an enormous effort of concentration, a lot of hard work and several near-dunkings, I progressed about 1,000m in roughly 15 minutes.</p> <p>All being well, Ian explained gently, on the Shunyi Rowing Park lake next week, a young man wearing Team GB colours called Alan Campbell will cover twice that distance in well under half the time. Campbell stands 6ft 3in tall, weighs 15st and has been preparing for this event for seven years. He is an awesome athlete (he trains, famously, by sprinting with a 50kg sandbag in his arms, and sawing through tree trunks one hand at a time). </p> <p>I'll be watching him with even more respect now I know that he'll be racing flat-out against the best in the world while perched on a sliver of carbon fibre whose natural inclination is to pitch him straight into the water.<br><strong>Jon Henley</strong></p> <h2>High jump</h2> <p>There are no women competing for Britain in the high jump at the 2008 Olympics, and before my intensive coaching session, I was confident this omission could be my ticket to Beijing. But after an hour of hitting the bar so many times that I was beginning to feel like the punch line in a bad joke, the reason was painfully clear - the event is one of the most technically demanding of the athletics on offer at the games. </p> <p>To even qualify for the event, which was part of the first modern Olympics in 1896, female athletes must jump a vertiginous 1.95m and male contestants have to clear 2.30m. To get to this height, says Andy Paul, coach at the Birchfield Harriers athletics club, you need \"controlled speed, explosive power and mobility in the air\". And in Birmingham's Alexander stadium, the training home of Tom Parsons, one of the country's three Olympic high jump hopefuls, Andy is showing me the basics.</p> <p>We start with coordination skills, and I quickly learn that even taking three running steps and jumping in the air on my left foot is beyond me. Reassuringly, Paul explains that this is not unheard of, at least among the youngest athletes, who can start jumping from the age of nine. \"When it comes to a technical event, you need to have started to develop the basics early on and a lot of kids come to sport now lacking basic skills. You end up trying to explain what, 10 or 15 years ago, people would have just learned by playing in the street.\"</p> <p>We move on to the run-up, takeoff and foot-plant. High jumpers must approach the bar running at a curve, so their speed is controlled and the last foot they put down, or plant, gives them the power to propel them over the bar, which is where technique comes in. </p> <p>\"No offence to my sprinting colleagues, but in those events you just point yourself and run. In high jump you have to transform horizontal speed to vertical height in the takeoff,\" says Paul. To help with this, high jumpers wear shoes with four spikes in the heel to steady them as they leap upwards.</p> <p>Trying to remember which leg to jump off on, how close to the bar to jump and all the while concentrating on getting my arms in the air and bringing my right knee up to propel me into the air is so confusing that all I manage is a little hop. Yet Andy is undeterred, and decides I am ready to try the Fosbury flop.</p> <p>First used by Dick Fosbury to win gold in the 1968 Olympics, this is the dominant style in high jump and requires you to twist your body in the air so you go over the bar headfirst. It's pretty tricky and as I continuously thud down, dragging the bar with me, I am relieved to have a \u00a33,000 high jump \"bed\" under me instead of the thin crash mats I remember from school.</p> <p>In the Olympics the athletes are allowed three attempts at each height to clear the bar, and the winner is the one who jumps the highest. If there is a tie, then the jumper with the fewest misses at the best height wins.</p> <p>Most high jumpers reach their peak in their early 20s and train six days a week for between one and three hours a day. Their training focuses on their legs, core muscles and flexibility. But the week before the Olympics, the British hopefuls will have cut down their gruelling winter training - including running, weights and lots of plyometrics (jumping and bounding) - and will be down to doing jumps every few days to perfect their technique. </p> <p>At the end of my training session, and after pleading to be allowed multiple \"last jumps\" to get it right, I finally clear the bar. I'm elated, and even when Paul points out that my 1.1m jump is about average for an eight-year-old I don't care - it's a complicated sport, but addictive.<br><strong>Homa Khaleeli</strong></p> <h2>BMX</h2> <p>It's a sunny afternoon in Peckham, south London, and I am about to step on to a BMX bike for the first time in 25 years. This is the first year that BMX will feature as an Olympic sport. It's too late for me to compete in Beijing, but I could be in the running for London in 2012. CK Flash runs Peckham BMX club, the No 1 club in the country, and as an Olympic scout coach, CK is looking for fresh talent. He is in luck. I hop on to my BMX, called Bronx, and ride gingerly for a few minutes before careering into the kerb. \"I think I'm a little rusty,\" I say. \"Do you think I need kneepads?\" \"Not for the speed you're going at,\" says CK.</p> <p>The track in Peckham is 120m long and with its ramps, slopes and table tops it is fiendishly technical. Olympic BMX riding, though, is not judged on being able to do fancy tricks - it's all about speed. There are no points for death-defying jumps. In fact the lower you jump, the faster you go. Professional BMX riders typically spend three hours a day in the gym working on their leg muscles, followed by another three hours on the BMX track, where they focus on their riding technique. </p> <p>I push forward, standing on the pedals as the bike bounces along the first three jumps. Then I slam on the brakes. \"You don't really expect me to go down that do you?\" I say pointing at a steep incline that doesn't so much slope as plunge with suicidal relish. \"Just stand up on your bike and roll down,\" he says. Six times I reach the slope and each time I balk. CK is getting frustrated, I am getting frustrated, the photographer who wants a shot of me not looking hopeless is getting frustrated. </p> <p>To make matters worse I am joined by members of Peckham BMX club. The kids - and I have T-shirts older than some of them - fly past me in a blur of fearlessness. As they hurtle around the track I slowly master the slope. I roll down with my feet on the ground, then with one foot on the pedal and finally while standing and with both feet on the pedals. </p> <p>It's time to see what I have learned. CK has the stopwatch and as he nods I start pushing on the pedals. I'm over the first bumps, rolling down the slope, standing as I ride. I reach the bottom and pedal hard towards the steep ramp. The bike begins to slide but I push harder and heave myself towards the table-top, rolling down the other side before pedalling furiously to the finish. My shirt is dripping in sweat and I have a crushing pain in my lower back, but I did it. \"In 32.6 seconds,\" says CK smiling. My overwhelming jubilation is dampened slightly when five-year-old Callum completes the same track in 18.2 seconds. CK tells me that Olympic contenders would clock a time of around seven seconds. At 37, it's possible my best BMX years may not be ahead of me and I tell CK that, despite my evident potential, I will not be pursuing it as an Olympic ambition. He tries not to look disappointed.<br><strong>Sarfraz Manzoor</strong></p>",
  "<p>US law enforcement officials said today that they had effectively solved a series of deadly 2001 anthrax attacks that sent a shockwave of fear through the country in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>Officials said the seven-year-long investigation points to a deceased US government scientist who was a renowned expert on the anthrax virus and had worked to develop a vaccine for the illness.</p> <p>The suspect, biodefence researcher Bruce Ivins, took his own life last week as authorities were preparing to charge him with perpetrating the attacks.</p> <p>\"Dr Bruce Ivins was responsible for the death, sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing, and it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone,\" said Joseph Persichini, assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.</p> <p>Law enforcement officials said that the release of the documents effectively culminates an exhaustive investigation that spanned six continents and led to the development of new scientific techniques to trace biological weapons to their source.</p> <p>\"We believe that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\" said Jeffrey Taylor, the top federal prosecutor for Washington. \"We are confident that Dr Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks.\"</p> <p>Officials said that they are now preparing to close the investigation into the 2001 attacks, which killed five people and sickened at least 17 others. Among the dead was 63-year-old Robert Stevens, a British-born picture editor for American Media who lived in Florida.</p> <p>Also killed were two US postal workers, Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen, Kathy Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant from New York City, and Otilie Lundgren, a 94-year-old Connecticut woman. Americans rushed to purchase ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that fights the germ.</p> <p>Coming just weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, the campaign crippled the US postal system and fuelled fears the US was under attack from biological weapons. Among those targeted were two top Democratic senators and US news organisations.</p> <p>After analysing the anthrax spores used in the attacks, investors began focusing on a US military research laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, where Ivins and an early suspect in the case, Steven Hatfill, worked.</p> <p>Justice department officials said newly developed scientific techniques were able to match the anthrax used in the attacks to a flask possessed by Ivins. Only a few other scientists had access to the flask, and they were eliminated form consideration.</p> <p>\"The spores used in the attacks were taken from that specific flask,\" and processed and loaded into the letters, Taylor said. \"No one received material from that flask without going through Dr Ivins.\" </p> <p>In addition, Ivins was unable to explain late-night laboratory work around the time of the attacks. He suffered from serious mental illness, telling a friend he was suffering from \"incredible paranoid, delusional thoughts at times\", that he feared he could not control his behaviour. </p> <p>Investigators believe he supplied false samples of anthrax in order to mislead investigators, and wrote an email claiming that al-Qaida terrorists had access to anthrax.</p> <p>Ivins, 62 at the time of his death, was a senior microbiologist who had worked for the US army medical research institute for infectious diseases for 27 years. He worked with anthrax since 1980.</p> <p>According to the affidavit, Ivins began working into the night in August 2001, a schedule change that departed from his colleagues and which ended shortly after the attacks.</p> <p>When confronted by investigators in March 2005, Ivins \"could provide no legitimate reason for the extended hours\".</p> <p>\"The investigation determined that Dr Ivins's role in the experiments were minimal, and did not justify the time he spent\" in the laboratory, wrote postal inspector Thomas Dellafera in an October 2007 court affidavit.</p> <p>Investigators found a series of emails in which Ivins described his mental state in bizarre language and wrote about his treatment.</p> <p>\"Occasionally I get this tingling that goes down both arms,\" Ivins wrote to a friend. \"At the same time I get a bit dizzy and get this unidentifiable 'metallic' taste in my mouth. (I'm not trying to be funny - It actually scares me a bit.) Other times it's like I'm not only sitting at my desk doing work, I'm also a few feet away watching me do it. There's nothing like living in both the first person singular AND the third person singular!\"</p> <p>Ivins was prescribed medications for anxiety and depression.</p> <p>Documents also reveal Ivins was obsessed with a US college sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, which maintained an office down the street from the Princeton, New Jersey, mailbox form which the anthrax letters were posted.</p>",
  "<p>Both the left and the right say they stand for economic growth. So should voters trying to decide between the two simply look at it as a matter of choosing alternative management teams?</p> <p>If only matters were so easy! Part of the problem concerns the role of luck. America's economy was blessed in the 1990s with low energy prices, a high pace of innovation, and a China increasingly offering high-quality goods at decreasing prices, all of which combined to produce low inflation and rapid growth.</p> <p>President Clinton and then-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/LSEPublicLecturesAndEvents/events/2007/20070514t1021z001.htm\">Alan Greenspan</a>, deserve little credit for this \u2013 though, to be sure, bad policies could have messed things up. By contrast, the problems faced today \u2013 high energy and food prices and a crumbling financial system \u2013 have, to a large extent, been brought about by bad policies.</p> <p>There are, indeed, big differences in growth strategies, which make different outcomes highly likely. The first difference concerns how growth itself is conceived. Growth is not just a matter of increasing GDP. It must be sustainable: growth based on environmental degradation, a debt-financed consumption binge, or the exploitation of scarce natural resources, without reinvesting the proceeds, is not sustainable.</p> <p>Growth also must be inclusive; at least a majority of citizens must benefit. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics\">Trickle-down economics</a> does not work: an increase in GDP can actually leave most citizens worse off. America's recent growth was neither economically sustainable nor inclusive. Most Americans are worse off today than they were seven years ago.</p> <p>But there need not be a trade-off between inequality and growth. Governments can enhance growth by increasing inclusiveness. A country's most valuable resource is its people. So it is essential to ensure that everyone can live up to their potential, which requires educational opportunities for all.</p> <p>A modern economy also requires risk-taking. Individuals are more willing to take risks if there is a good safety net. If not, citizens may demand protection from foreign competition. Social protection is more efficient than protectionism.</p> <p>Failures to promote social solidarity can have other costs, not the least of which are the social and private expenditures required to protect property and incarcerate criminals. It is estimated that within a few years, America will have more people working in the security business than in education. A year in prison can cost more than a year at Harvard. The cost of incarcerating two million Americans \u2013 one of the <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/icps/downloads/world-prison-pop-seventh.pdf\">highest per capita rates (pdf)</a> in the world \u2013 should be viewed as a subtraction from GDP, yet it is added on.</p> <p>A second major difference between left and right concerns the role of the state in promoting development. The left understands that the government's role in providing infrastructure and education, developing technology, and even acting as an entrepreneur is vital. Government laid the foundations of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore's_contributions_to_the_Internet_and_technology\">internet</a> and the modern biotechnology revolutions. In the 19th century, research at America's government-supported universities provided the basis for the agricultural revolution. Government then brought these advances to millions of American farmers. Small business loans have been pivotal in creating not only new businesses, but whole new industries.</p> <p>The final difference may seem odd: the left now understands markets, and the role that they can and should play in the economy. The right, especially in America, does not. The new right, typified by the Bush-Cheney administration, is really old corporatism in a new guise.</p> <p>These are not libertarians. They believe in a strong state with robust executive powers, but one used in defense of established interests, with little attention to market principles. The list of examples is long, but it includes subsidies to large corporate farms, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-03-06-steel.htm\">tariffs</a> to protect the steel industry, and, most recently, the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/080721e/\">mega-bailouts</a> of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. But the inconsistency between rhetoric and reality is long-standing: protectionism expanded under Reagan, including through the imposition of so-called voluntary export restraints on Japanese cars.</p> <p>By contrast, the new left is trying to make markets work. Unfettered markets do not operate well on their own \u2013 a conclusion reinforced by the current financial debacle. Defenders of markets sometimes admit that they do fail, even disastrously, but they claim that markets are \"self-correcting.\" During the Great Depression, similar arguments were heard: the government need not do anything, because markets would restore the economy to full employment in the long run. But, as John Maynard Keynes famously put it, in the long run we are all dead.</p> <p>Markets are not self-correcting in the relevant time frame. No government can sit idly by as a country goes into recession or depression, even when caused by the excessive greed of bankers or misjudgment of risks by security markets and rating agencies. But if governments are going to pay the economy's hospital bills, they must act to make it less likely that hospitalisation will be needed. The right's deregulation mantra was simply wrong, and we are now paying the price. And the price tag \u2013 in terms of lost output \u2013 will be high, perhaps more than $1.5trn in the US alone.</p> <p>The right often traces its intellectual parentage to <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/Library/Enc/bios/Smith.html\">Adam Smith</a>, but while Smith recognised the power of markets, he also recognised their limits. Even in his era, businesses found that they could increase profits more easily by conspiring to raise prices than by producing innovative products more efficiently. There is a need for strong anti-trust laws.</p> <p>It is easy to host a party. For the moment, everyone can feel good. Promoting sustainable growth is much harder.

  "<p> A San Francisco-based group going by the name of <a href=\"http://bayareadirectaction.wordpress.com/\">Direct Action to Stop the War</a> has carried out a protest against the <a href=\"http://www.americasarmy.com/\">America's Army</a> series of FPS games. The titles are commissioned by the US military and act as a recruitment tool - there have been Xbox and mobile phone versions as well as a downloadable PC iteration. DASW claims that, as the game has a Teen rating, allowing 13-year-olds to play, it effectively represents an attempt to target and recruit children. From the website:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>The military recruitment of children under the age of 17, however, is a clear violation of international law (the U.N. Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict). No attempt to recruit children 13-16 is allowed in the United States, pursuant to treaty. In May, the American Civil Liberties Union published a report that found the armed services regularly target children under 17 for military recruitment. The report highlighted the role of \"America's Army,\" saying the Army uses the game to \"attract young potential recruits . . . train them to use weapons, and engage in virtual combat and other military missions\", adding that the game \"explicitly targets boys 13 and older.\"</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>The site also quotes an 'informal study' which claims that four out of 100 new recruits in <a href=\"https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/\">Fort Benning,</a> credit America's Army as the primary factor in convincing them to join the military. Additionally, \"a 2004 Army survey found that nearly a third of young Americans ages 16 to 24 had some contact with the game in the previous six months\". These are compelling stats, but they're vulnerable to a familiar ambiguity - is the game seducing players into taking an interest in the army, or does it merely appeal to people who are <em>already</em> potential recruits?</p> <p>Today's protest was aimed at videogame publishers and developers involved in the production and development of the games, including Ubisoft. No word yet on how many people turned up, or what specific form the protest took, but it'll be interesting to see if Ubisoft reacts at all. The French publisher has a long-term contract to distribute console versions of the series, the latest of which - America's Army: True Heroes - was released last year.</p> <p>So is it reasonable for mainstream publishers to work on games with a military recruitment agenda? It could easily be argued that most - if not all - military shooters provide a positive representation of the army experience. You don't get speed-addled fighter pilots dropping bombs on allied vehicles in Call of Duty IV; there's no opportunity to torture and abuse prisoners in Battlefield 2 Modern Combat. Criticism, or even acknowledgement, of the moral ambiguities of warfare are largely absent. Is America's Army just the most highly visible and explictly pitched example of a wider programme of tacit approval? If so, is it wrong?</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/05/guantanamo.usa\">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> was found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/06/osamabinladen.guantanamo\">guilty of providing material support for terrorism</a> at a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/washington/07gitmo.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\">Guant\u00e1namo military commission</a> today. Hamdan's guilt was never in doubt, but it is rather surprising that the prosecution was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/06/AR2008080601092.html\">unable to persuade</a> a simple majority of the military jurors that Hamdan participated in a conspiracy to murder American soldiers, for which he was also charged. That failure underscores the fact that we learned more during this trial about the feebleness and bankruptcy of the Bush administration's fight against terrorism than we did about Salim Ahmed Hamdan or al-Qaida.</p> <p>Hamdan was Osama bin Laden's driver, a fact he never denied. It would have been an open and shut case of material support for terrorism in federal court. If the Bush administration had chosen that path, Hamdan would have been safely locked away years ago. But no, the Bush administration chose to create a system of military commissions to pursue war crimes charges against suspected al-Qaida terrorists, because they were highly valued intelligence assets and the procedures of regular criminal trials were too restrictive to make a case against these battlefield detainees. After nearly seven years, we have the first example of results, and it's not good.</p> <p>Osama bin Laden's driver is clearly a highly-prized intelligence asset who likely possessed invaluable information about the movements and perhaps even the whereabouts of bin Laden and other senior al-Qaida figures. This is exactly the situation envisioned when the military commission system was created. No lawyers would get in the way of interrogations. No deals would be sought to provide information in exchange for leniency.</p> <p>So what happened? During his interrogation, Hamdan made a serious offer of assistance, and the government didn't do anything about it. We don't know precisely what this offer entailed because that portion of the government's case was presented to the jury in secret. But we do know that Hamdan's attorney reminded the jurors of the offer and the government's subsequent inaction during his closing argument. It seems likely that this was a very serious offer, probably to help to track down Hamdan's former boss, if the defence wanted to remind the jurors about something in the prosecution's case. The whole point of keeping people like Hamdan out of the criminal system was to gather intelligence like this. Yet when presented with an offer of assistance from Osama bin Laden's former driver, they botched it.</p> <p>The more permissive rules and procedures for the commissions is what has caused numerous courts to rule the commissions unlawful. No US court has yet to determine whether this latest iteration meets the standards of American law, meaning that Hamdan's and any other convictions in the commissions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/guantanamo.usa\">could be invalidated</a> some time in the future. </p> <p>These new rules have also created the perverse situation of putting US judges in the position of having to decide how much torture it too much. The judge in Hamdan's case ruled that some of Hamdan's statements were inadmissible because they were made in \"highly coercive\" conditions, but others were allowed because they were merely \"coercive\".</p> <p>So now that we have wound our way through various euphemisms to find an acceptable level of torture, what was the result in the trial? Hamdan was acquitted of the charge to which these coerced statements pertained. So we went through this whole exercise for nothing.</p> <p>The worst aspect of this entire process is that the Bush administration has simultaneously devalued the concept of a war crime and elevated al-Qaida terrorists to the status of warriors. Charles Taylor is a war criminal. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/warcrimes.internationalcrime\">Radovan Karadzic</a> is a war criminal. Salim Hamdan is a chauffeur. He is clearly guilty of the crime of material support for terrorism. But now he is a warrior, legitimising al-Qaida terrorists' belief that they are waging a holy war against the United States and our allies.</p> <p>The Bush administration turned an open and shut case into a seven-year odyssey that undermines the entire rationale for bypassing the criminal justice system in the first place. Well done.</p>",
  "<p>Salim Ahmed Hamdan was born in Wadi Hadhramaut, a fertile oasis in the mountainous desert of south-eastern Yemen, in around 1970. </p> <p>The son of a Bedouin farmer and shopkeeper, he received little formal education after being orphaned at a young age. </p> <p>Forced to depend on the charity of his relatives, he moved to the port city of Mukalla, where he did odd jobs. </p> <p>Following Yemen's unification in 1990, Hamdan moved north to Sana'a to seek his fortune, but fell on hard times. </p> <p>The prospects for someone with only a limited education were poor, but he found his way to the Martyrs' mosque, where he picked up work as a driver. </p> <p>It was there that he mixed with jihadis. Six years later, with the offer of a regular salary and free passage, he joined a group to oust the Russian-backed government in Tajikistan. </p> <p>With access to Tajikistan impossible, the men assembled in Afghanistan and asked for the help of Osama bin Laden, who had recently arrived after being expelled from Sudan.</p> <p>Hamdan was employed by Bin Laden as a mechanic and driver for his car pool. With pay guaranteed, he followed the advice of his boss when he married a Yemeni girl and started a family.</p> <p>His wife's sister was married to Nasser al-Bahri, one of Bin Laden's bodyguards, who was arrested in 2000 on suspicion of terrorism after the bombing of the USS Cole. </p> <p>Despite his brother-in-law's incarceration, Hamdan continued to work as Bin Laden's driver because, he said, he needed to support his family. </p> <p>In late November 2001, with the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan well under way, he was picked up near the border of Pakistan by a group of Afghan warlords and handed over to the US, who transferred him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Hamdan made headlines last year with a court challenge that led the supreme court to declare the first military commissions authorised by the US president, George Bush, unlawful. </p> <p>Congress subsequently passed legislation authorising a new system of tribunals.</p> <p>Lawyers for Hamdan argued at the time that Bush had violated basic military protections with his November 2001 executive order setting up the tribunals.</p> <p>They said suspects brought before the tribunals did not have the right to a lawyer of their choice or to see the evidence against them. </p> <p>Even if they were acquitted and freed, the verdict could be reversed by the defence secretary.</p> <p>The lawyers argued that this framework made the tribunals unconstitutional because it allowed the president to define the crime and select the prosecutor and judges who acted as jury.</p> <p>Hamdan alleged that he was beaten, forced into painful positions, subjected to extreme cold temperatures and threatened with death in 2001 and early 2002.</p> <p>He also described being kept in such extreme isolation after being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo that he once considered \"pleading guilty in order to get out of here\".</p> <p>After Hamdan won his landmark ruling against the first military commissions, he was again charged under the new system of tribunals.</p> <p>After seven years in detention, he was tried by a military court and convicted of supporting terrorism but acquitted of the more serious charge of conspiring with al-Qaida.</p>",
  "<p>A month ago, at the G8 summit in Tokyo, developed nations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/11/g8\">showed</a> how out of touch they were with the changing reality of the world. With last week's breakdown of the Doha round of global trade talks in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/business/worldbusiness/31trade.html?em&amp;ex=1217649600&amp;en=ab0166a68ef58dd0&amp;ei=5087%0A\">Geneva</a>, the rising economic powers are making their voices heard.</p> <p>Those who relish the relative decline of the west can only cheer. The era when it could dictate trade terms through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its predecessors certainly belongs to history. But the new dawn may not turn out to have quite the rosy glow that the declinists detect.</p> <p>First, the big developing economies are far from forming a solid grouping with identical interests. Brazil, in particular, has taken a different position this summer to India, China or African countries. As a country that has the natural resources and food that others want, it is in a position of independence that dictates its approach to trade. China and India are all for opening up the markets of others for their exports, but followed lines at Geneva that would have limited the degree of reciprocation, which, in turn, would have worked against the poorer agricultural producers. As for the fourth member of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\">Bric</a> group, Russia's energy riches put it in a category of its own \u2013 and the G8 showed it trying to have one foot in the developed camp and the other with its Bric colleagues. </p> <p>Add in the specific concerns of the other major source of new wealth, the Gulf states, which are usually conveniently omitted from such discussions despite their financial muscle, plus the differences within Latin America and Africa, and you are left with a rich variety of interests subject to wide variations. Not to mention resource-rich Australia, or South Korea or virtually indefinable Indonesia.</p> <p>I suppose it might be argued that there is no need for overall order in world trade, and that country-to-country deals represent the future. But a broad-based system with clear rules and procedures is calculated to encourage both general exchanges and bilateral trade as the example of China since it joined the WTO demonstrates.</p> <p>Global trade anarchy, on the other hand, would encourage commercial wars, preferential arrangements and competitive devaluations. The post-1929 example provides sufficient evidence of that. The financial crisis that is brewing around us would be hugely aggravated if it were accompanied by the kind of me-first policies that characterised the 1930s. Global financial flows are out of control; the last thing that is needed is a breakdown of the global trading system which, for all its exploitation, has brought more people into a materially upwardly-mobile system than ever before in human history.</p> <p>Some may not like any of this, but they have never made a convincing case as far as I can see. Coastal China may have a plethora of sweatshops and western companies may pad their profits by moving production there; but why do 100 million migrant workers move from the inland to the coast to work in them? Because they offer a way to material betterment for them and for those who stayed back on the farm and get their remittances. That may be unpalatable to western liberals, but it represents a choice that must be respected. The People's Republic chose this path 30 years ago, and its people have voted overwhelmingly with their feet to follow it.</p> <p>Nor should the anti-western argument be allowed to fool anybody that China, India and other developing countries were acting at Geneva in anything but their own direct self-interest. There is nothing surprising or reprehensible about that, but nor is there anything exemplary. Being poor may mean you should be helped, but it does not mean you are right. </p> <p>For all its travails, the achievement of the WTO and its predecessors has been to provide a forum which could produce solutions of general interest from negotiation and mutual concessions, based on self-interest that went beyond the most basic of calculations. This was, naturally, less dramatic than the <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Seattle.asp\">Seattle demonstrations</a> or the breakdown in Geneva. Global structures and systems find it hard to get a good press, particularly in an age where many see them as the exploitative emanation of the evil west and overlook the fact that the WTO is too democratic for its own good. <a href=\"http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24926.html\">Winston Churchill</a>'s remark about democracy might be trotted out here.</p> <p>For all its faults, the Doha round is the best way of organising world trade we have. Those who glory in its crisis as vindication of their crusade against the US-led policies that have underpinned globalisation might answer a simple question: what would they put in its place, who would they install in the driving seat, and how would they ensure continued growth for the poorer nations that know how trade can lift their people out of poverty?</p>",
  "<p>The man charged in connection with the kidnapping of his seven-year-old London-based daughter is to be interviewed by Los Angeles police investigating the disappearance of a California couple more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>But even as law enforcement agencies across the country focused on the man claiming to be Clark Rockefeller, his true identity remained unclear.</p> <p>Admitting that the case was \"very unusual\", Suffolk county, Massachusetts, district attorney Daniel Conley told MSNBC today that, \"One thing we're sure of, he's not Clark Rockefeller.\"</p> <p>LA county homicide detectives were due to speak to Rockefeller today in connection with the disappearance of Jonathan Sohus, 26, and his wife Linda, 28, from their home in the well-heeled city of San Marino in 1985</p> <p>Rockefeller, 48, was arrested in an FBI sting in Baltimore on Saturday after a weeklong manhunt. Following a court appearance on Monday he was extradited to Boston where he was charged with kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and endangering a minor.</p> <p>But Los Angeles police think Rockefeller may be Christopher Crowe Mountbatten Chichester, a suspect in the disappearance of the San Marino couple.</p> <p>Chichester, who claimed to be the son of a British aristocrat, rented the guest house on the young couple's property. After their disappearance in 1985, he subsequently vanished three years later.</p> <p>District attorney Conley said that Rockefeller's fingerprints matched those of Charles Smith, who has a criminal record. The prints may be linked to the Californian case.</p> <p>During yesterday's hearing, Rockefeller's only remark was to deny that he was Smith. \"That's not me,\" he was heard to mutter.</p> <p>Smith is the latest in a lengthy string of aliases possibly used by Rockefeller that have stymied investigators' attempts to determine the real identity of the man in custody in Boston.</p> <p>Los Angeles detectives concluded at the time of the original disappearance that the man calling himself Chichester was a German national named Christian Gerhart Streiter.</p> <p>Shortly after he disappeared, in 1988, a man named Christopher Crowe tried to sell the missing couple's car.</p> <p>Clark Rockefeller first appeared in New York City in 1993, moving in high society and boasting a blue chip art collection. The following year he married Sandra Boss, and the two had a daughter, Reigh Storrow Boss, nicknamed Snooks.</p> <p>At the end of last year, the couple divorced, with the mother, now based in London, getting full custody. The father was given supervised visiting rights. It has been reported that one of the reasons for the couple's divorce was Boss's doubts about her husband's true identity.</p> <p>At the same time that their divorce was finalised, a man called Charles \"Chip\" Smith appeared in Baltimore searching for a home for him and his daughter.</p> <p>Last month, Rockefeller bought $300,000 in gold bullion. Shortly afterwards, on July 27 in Boston during the first supervised visit by his daughter, Rockefeller allegedly pushed a social worker aside and threw Reigh into the back of a waiting vehicle, sparking a huge manhunt. </p> <p>He was traced to Baltimore, where FBI officers lured him away from the girl by telling him that his catamaran, moored at a nearby marina, was taking on water. When agents entered his apartment they found the girl, who reportedly said she was \"ecstatic \u2026 to see nice people\".</p> <p>Agents found 300 one-ounce gold coins and $12,000 in cash in the apartment. A pre-trial hearing is set for September 3.</p> <p>Conley noted that it had to date proved impossible to verify the identity of the man held in custody.</p> <p>\"Our experience tells us he's more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory,\" Conley said.</p>",
  "<p>American authorities have uncovered a massive global computer hacking and credit card fraud ring spanning the US, eastern Europe and Asia, officials said this week.</p> <p>The US justice department has charged 11 individuals from the US, China and three former Soviet republics with stealing more than 40m credit and debit card numbers and selling them to criminals in the US and Europe, in a case that highlights the increasing vulnerability of world commerce to hackers and identity thieves.</p> <p>The indictments culminate a three-year investigation involving law enforcement authorities from at least four countries.<br>America's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Michael Mukasey, said the financial toll in the case is \"impossible to quantify at this point\".</p> <p>Justice department attorney Michael Sullivan said that most of the victims were in the US, but said officials have yet to identify all those whose credit card numbers were stolen.</p> <p>\"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised,\" he said.</p> <p>According to justice department officials and court documents, the ring mined credit and debit card numbers by driving alongside US retail stores in search of wireless internet connections. Among the companies attacked were TJX Companies, owner of TJ Maxx clothing outlets; Barnes and Noble; OfficeMax; Sports Authority and others.</p> <p>Upon gaining access to the computer networks, the defendants installed \"sniffer\" software that would surreptitiously record card numbers, justice department officials said. The defendants then sold the numbers over the internet to individuals who encoded them onto blank credit cards and withdrew tens of thousands of dollars at a time from cash machines.</p> <p>According to court documents unsealed this week, three of the defendants, Sergey Pavlovich of Belarus and Dzmitry Burak and Sergey Storchak of Ukraine, used a website on which credit card number traffickers bought and sold numbers, with Pavlovich taking a percentage of the sales.</p> <p>In addition, two other defendants, Maksym Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine and Aleksandr Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia, known on the internet as JonnyHell, tricked staff at a Long Island, New York, restaurant into allowing them access to computer cash registers, the justice department said in court documents. </p> <p>They then installed sniffer software that captured credit and debit card numbers. Justice officials said Yastremskiy pocketed more than $11m from the sale of the stolen numbers.</p> <p>One of the defendants, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, was an informant for the US secret service, the agency tasked with protecting the US president and combating financial fraud and counterfeiting. </p> <p>He faces life in prison if convicted on all charges.</p> <p>Mukasey said the case highlights the global economy's vulnerability to computer hackers, although he urged consumers to remain confident in the nation's electronic payment system.</p> <p>\"Computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy,\" Mukasey said yesterday. \"But even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication, they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals. Where criminals are able to breach computer security systems, as alleged here, they have enormous ability to cause harm.\"</p> <p>But John Pescatore, a wireless security analyst at US consulting firm Gartner Inc, said the retailers could have prevented the breaches with available technology.</p> <p>\"These stores just did not take the right precautions and the bad guys said 'Cool, we can sit in the parking lot and break into the retailer through the wireless network,'\" he said. \"This was a failure by the companies cited. It was the equivalent of if your bank didn't lock the door to the vault.\"</p> <p>The defendants were charged with crimes including identity theft, possession of \"unauthorised access devices\", and offences connected to the stolen card data.</p> <p>Two Chinese defendants, Burak, Storchak, Pavlovich and a person known only by the internet nickname \"Delpiero\" remain at large. </p> <p>Turkish police captured Yastremskiy in July 2007 when he was in the country on vacation, the justice department said. Suvorov was apprehended in March by German police in Frankfurt. The US seeks his extradition.</p> <p>The defendants maintained operations in China, the Philippines and Thailand, the justice department said.</p> <p>\"So far as we know, this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country,\" Mukasey said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Richard Frenneaux (vocals, guitar), Shawn Day (bass), James Griffiths (drums), Paul Mellon (guitar), Chris Edmonds (keyboards). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Yesterday's new band extolled the virtues of animal-shaped confectionery. Today's lot are into Meccano, that toy construction kit kids used to play with in the 70s. And as with yesterday's Sugar Mouse by Oh, Atoms, Red Light Company's song Meccano is a meditation on childhood, the titular toy a symbol of, or metaphor for, growing old and apart. As mainman Frenneaux says: \"It's based around an imaginary conversation between two old friends and the distance growing between them as their lives go on. It's about the regret of a passing friendship.\" It's a good deal less twee and winsome (compliments, by the way) than Sugar Mouse. Meccano is surging, dynamic, built by indie boys for arenas, the sort of anthemic fist-waver gloom-rock bands go for when they want to convey triumph-over-adversity or majestic sorrow. It's powerful yet hook-laden, and the more we play it, the more we can't believe they went on tour as support to Editors, not because they didn't deserve to, but because they threaten to eclipse them \u2013 and White Lies for that matter - as Britain's premier new exponents of elegiac pop-metal. <br> And they only formed last year, which makes Meccano and other tracks such as With Lights Out, about the suicide of one of Frenneaux's childhood friends, all the more impressive. And if they sound accomplished and cohesive as a unit after such a short amount of time together, bear in mind that they come from, if not all four, then several corners of the globe. Richard Frenneaux was born in England and spent his formative years in Australia and New Zealand. Shawn Day is from Wyoming, the least populated state in America, but was born in Osaka, Japan. James Griffiths is from Bridgend in Wales, Paul Mellon is from Motherwell in Scotland and Chris Edmonds is from Maidenhead. And yet they sound like we imagine all bands want to sound: like old mates, childhood friends even, who have been performing together for years. </p> <p>They almost didn't get together at all. Frenneaux and Day met on the internet after Day saw an advert posted by Frenneaux. This was Tuesday afternoon; the band had a gig in London on the Friday. So Day played a song Frenneaux had written called Scheme Eugene and immediately emailed him to say, \"I want to play my bass in London. I don't fuck around\". Indeed, he doesn't: he packed, went to the airport, bought a ticket, maybe even a magazine and some Juicy Fruit, and flew across the Atlantic. Problem was, on arrival at Gatwick he was unable to provide proof of sufficient funds for his stay in the UK and was detained for six hours. The immigration officer finally agreed for the band to meet with Day while insisting that he had to catch the first flight back to America the following morning. So Day jumped in the band's van and had an unplugged audition on the spot. He was in, with one proviso: no guitar solos. Within a month Day had sold up in the States, he was living in Blighty, and before they knew it Red Light Company were being written about in glowing terms in the Guardian's excellent New Band of the Day column.<br> <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Red Light Company storm into contention with an Arcade Fire-like blast of intense emotion.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's like White Lies never happened \u2013 and, with RLC around, they might not get the chance. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Build a career with such ease it will be like they're playing with a toy construction kit. Or something.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Write a song about Duplo. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The single Meccano is released by LaVolta on Monday. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> White Lies, Editors, U2, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/redlightcompany\">www.myspace.com/redlightcompany</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Das Wanderlust.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/06/nhs.health1\">According to figures released today</a>, under a Freedom of Information act application by the Conservative shadow health team, NHS hospitals are suffering from frequent infestations of vermin such as rats, mice, fleas, bedbugs, ants and cockroaches. With almost 20,000 incidents recorded in hospitals between January 2006 and March this year, pest controllers have been called in to tackle <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7542718.stm\">outbreaks</a> on a regular basis in 70% of NHS trusts. Two-thirds of trusts report trouble with rats and nearly as many with cockroaches. </p> <p>Despite obvious concerns about the potential risk to public health, the head of the healthcare-associated infection programme at the Healthcare Commission, Christine Braithwaite, responded that concerns around pest control in hospitals \"have, to date, been negligible\". </p> <p>Ever been bitten by a bug in a hospital bed or seen a rat in casualty? What's your experience of hospital hygiene?</p>",
  "<p>Pollen could be used to identify the perpetrators of gun crimes, thanks to developments in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/nanotechnology\">nanotechnology</a>. The microscopic grains can be coated onto bullets during manufacture and are sticky enough to hold on even after the gun has been fired. Each 'nanotag' is made up of pollen and a unique chemical signature that can be used to identify the batch of ammunition.</p> <p>The pollen grains \u2013 from one of two species of lily \u2013 are around 30 micrometres in diameter and are invisible to the naked eye. Thousands can be attached to each cartridge.</p> <p>\"The tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen, a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties,\" said <a href=\"http://www.surrey.ac.uk/Chemistry/staff/fpage_pas.shtml\">Prof Paul Sermon from the University of Surrey</a>, who led the research. \"It has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide, zirconia [zirconium dioxide], silica or a mixture of other oxides. The precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another, enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user.\" </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs08/hosb0308.pdf\">UK Home Office, there were 18,489 crimes involving firearms in England and Wales</a> in 2006-7. But DNA profiling using skin cells or other biological material stuck to gun cartridges is only successful in about 10% of cases. DNA is damaged by the heat produced when the bullet is fired and also by copper released from the cartridge case by mildly acidic sweat.</p> <p>If all ammunition were marked with pollen tags, they could help police find out when and where a bullet had been bought. The nanotags are also difficult to remove from clothes and hands, so it would be possible to prove that a suspect had handled a particular batch of ammunition. </p> <p>The pollen tags could be combined with another method developed by the same team that involves roughening the surface of the bullet at a very fine scale so as to capture dead skin cells from the thumb of someone handling it.</p> <p>\"We're currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers,\" said Sermon, \"but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place.\"</p>",
  "<p>Texas today was accused of putting Americans abroad at risk for defying the International Court of Justice and the government of Mexico to carry out the execution of a Mexican national.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn was put to death by lethal injection last night at a prison north of Houston. His lawyers said the execution breached America's treaty obligations which give foreign nationals such as Medell\u00edn the right to talk with consular officials.</p> <p>\"With this action, our nation has broken a commitment willingly made by our president and our Senate when we agreed to this treaty,\" said Donald Francis Donovan.</p> <p>\"We must now hope that other nations stand stronger in their promises than we do, lest our own citizens be placed at risk elsewhere.\"</p> <p>The Mexican government had filed a letter of protest about the case, and the ICJ had demanded a judicial review for Medell\u00edn.

The parents watched his execution.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry my actions caused you pain,\" Medell\u00edn told them. \"I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbour hate.\"</p>",
  "<p>National stereotypes are notoriously hard to overcome, as modern Germany can testify. As Berlin sees it, a distressingly large number of Britons, encouraged by tabloid newspapers, persist in viewing Germans as goose-stepping, deckchair-stealing, inhumanly efficient Teutons with tendencies towards world domination.</p> <p>Much of the world seems to view the British in their turn as bumbling bowler-hatted City gents, effete Cambridge-educated spies, or red-faced hooligans who get fighting drunk at football matches. As for the French, it was established long ago that their breath smells of garlic, their armies cannot fight, and their leaders cannot be trusted -\u2013 or so the parody goes.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.simonanholt.blogspot.com/\">Simon Anholt</a>, an expert on branding, heritage and identity, perceptions of countries and peoples, positive or negative, accurate or absurdist, are highly resistant to change:</p> <blockquote> <p>National image is so stable because we all seem to need these comforting stereotypes that enable us to put countries in convenient pigeon-holes \u2026 National reputation cannot be constructed. It can only be earned.</p> </blockquote> <p>Undeterred by such warnings, governments around the world continually try, as ever, to boost their country's international standing and influence. But instead of pursuing these aims through warfare, domination, subversion, Machiavellian statecraft and secret alliances, as in the past, many are reaching for a fashionable new tool: \"public diplomacy\".</p> <p>Originally coined in the 1960s, public diplomacy is a means of advancing national foreign policy, security and economic objectives by engaging directly with peoples rather than with their governments \u2013 thereby rendering them more receptive and sympathetic to a given message or policy. Sceptics say this is merely a posh name for propaganda; proponents say public diplomacy's purposes are more benign.</p> <p>As Alex Evans and David Steven explain in a new Foreign Office <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/publications/publications/pd-publication/\">study</a>, the use of public diplomacy is increasing because the sternest tests facing governments aren't susceptible to home-grown or state-to-state solutions. They say: </p> <blockquote> <p>Look at today's biggest global issues \u2013 climate change, pandemics, energy security, terrorism and other 'shadow sides' of globalisation \u2013 and it's striking that the challenges governments find it hardest to deal with are highly diffuse, involving the actions and beliefs of millions (if not billions) of people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The relative powerlessness of individual nations is exacerbated by the poor record of multilateral institutions in delivering global solutions. The World Trade Organisation's failure to agree <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Development_Round\">new trade rules</a> and the UN's under-shooting of its own millennium <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">goals</a> are cases in point.</p> <p>Obtaining measurable, beneficial results from public diplomacy is entirely possible, but certain principles must be observed, said <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/publications/publications/pd-publication/7-lessons\">Professor Nicholas Cull</a> of the University of Southern California.</p> <p>An example of how not to do it was provided by Karen Hughes who, in her newly-created role as US under-secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, undertook a Middle East \"<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-09-22-hughes-listening-tour_x.htm\">listening tour</a>\" in 2005, Cull said. The exercise was attacked by Arab audiences and media as a patronising display of Bush administration arrogance and ignorance. Instead of winning hearts and minds, it soured them.</p> <p>Winston Churchill performed better when he successfully sought to persuade the American public in 1940-41 that the biggest empire the world had ever known was the underdog in its war with Hitler's Germany. Churchill achieved this feat in part by allowing American journalists to freely report from London, thereby validating his message.</p> <p>Maintaining high credibility is a key element in pursuing successful public diplomacy, moulding image and influencing perceptions, Cull said. Other must-dos include ensuring that actions match words (often a problem for governments), adept and timely use of media, acceptance that this quintessential \"soft power\" tool will not produce quick results, and adherence to the Confucian concept of \"attracting by virtue\" \u2013 in other words, seizing and holding the moral high ground. </p> <p>\"A small number of people can cause a great deal of damage,\" Cull said, citing the adverse impact on America's worldwide reputation resulting from the actions of a few US prison guards at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.</p> <p>Some countries are better at public diplomacy than others. Iran is a good example of how a small government clique can turn a proud nation into a pariah. Ireland is the opposite, having apparently convinced just about everybody of its innate goodness and charm despite a moderately violent recent past.</p> <p>According to Cull, China comes bottom of the class, having grasped the wrong end of the stick, perhaps deliberately. The unelected ruling communists use public diplomacy not to influence outsiders but to legitimise themselves in the eyes of their own people, he said.</p> <p>Like Brezhnev's Soviet Union, China had created an \"immense bureaucracy whose aim is not to engage foreigners but to build a reassuring (but fictitious) image, for domestic consumption, of global admiration for their country\". The Olympics mark the culmination of that Orwellian endeavour.</p>",
  "<p>Once again, immigration takes centre stage on the Danish political scene. Denmark has one of tightest immigration policies in the European Union and this time it is a ruling by the European court of justice that has kick-started the row. The court <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7525472.stm\">ruled last week</a> that the Irish government should not prevent spouses of EU citizens who are not themselves EU citizens from living in the Republic of Ireland. The court found that the 2006 regulation introduced by the Irish government <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0725/breaking40.html?via=mr\">is in breach of a 2004 directive</a> on freedom of movement for EU citizens, a core principle of EU citizenship. The verdict means that non-approved asylum seekers will have the right to settle in any given EU country if they are married to an EU citizen, and \"all\" it takes to get married to a non-EU citizen is to go to another EU country, stay there for a few weeks and then return.</p> <p>While Denmark is far from being the only country affected by the verdict, the political and media reactions in Denmark <a href=\"http://euobserver.com/843/26557\">far outweigh</a> those of other member states \u2013 immigration issues have been front-page stuff all summer. Denmark is not alone in disagreeing with the court: the UK and nine other EU countries agree in principle with the Danish government. In response to a query on the issue, the <a href=\"http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk\">Home Office</a> said: </p> <blockquote> <p>The decision goes against the spirit of the directive which is about free movement for EU nationals and we were one of 10 member states supporting the Irish position. All member states will be carefully considering the judgment and its implications. </p> </blockquote> <p>It would appear, however, that there is precious little time for careful consideration in Denmark. The Danish integration minister, Birthe Roenn Hornbech, is in the eye of a political storm that encompasses the whole centre-right government. The ruling party is under pressure from its political backer, the Danish People's party (DPP), to take the court's decision to the EU demanding exceptions from the ruling for Denmark. Pia Kjaersgaard, the leader of the DPP, is demanding that Denmark retain the power to dictate who is to get a residence permit, not the EU: \"our party is demanding an influence on EU matters. We should tell the EU and the court that we and only we control matters of immigration in Denmark\", <a href=\"http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2008/08/03/194140.htm\">Kjaersgaard said</a>. According to a recent poll, more than half of Danes agree with her. Centrist politicians are busy trying not to loose ground to the ever more popular rightwing nationalists and both the government and the social democratic opposition have issued warnings to the EU and in particular the EU court of justice, which is claimed to be far too politically active. </p> <p>Immigration and in particular the integration of Muslims remains high on the political agenda in Denmark and there are votes to be lost by not adopting a hard line on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/04/denmarklosestolerance\">foreigners and immigration</a>. The nationalistic political climate has let to a situation where Denmark's immigration service has (probably) knowingly differed from EU directives. Although the integration minister admitted this week that the government had been caught napping, there are likely to be serious political consequences both domestically and on the European scene.</p> <p>As European law takes precedence over national legislation in such matters, the member states have to follow the court's ruling in applying national immigration policy and in Denmark this may prove tricky indeed. The government has been relying on the support of the DPP since 2001; the rightwingers have to a large extent been dictating immigration policy and are in no mood to let the government apply EU directives to the letter. This leaves the prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen with an unenviable choice: confront the EU (and sacrifice a planned top job in Europe), or oppose his political backers on the domestic scene.</p> <p>The heated debate in Denmark speaks loudly about the Danes' continuing unease with immigration and its multi-ethnic society, but it also throws up a potentially wider European problem of sovereignty on delicate matters such as immigration and the active integrationalist role of the European court of justice.</p>",
  "<p>Ashwell Prince has joined Nottinghamshire until the end of the season as the county bid to preserve their lead at the top of LV County Championship Division One table. </p> <p>The Nottinghamshire director of cricket Mick Newell confirmed the signing of the South African, bringing an end to their lengthy search for an overseas player to replace the Australian batsman Mike Hussey, who was released in June after it emerged that he would be unable to fulfill his commitments due to international obligations. </p> <p>Hussey was initially expected to be replaced by fellow Australian batsman Adam Voges but he, too, would have been unavailable for selection for six weeks of the season. Subsequently it was hoped that VVS Laxman could fill the vacancy, but his move was impeded when the Board of Control for Cricket in India withdrew his No Objection Certificate. </p> <p>However, it has now been announced that the 28-year-old Prince will join the side and is expected to make his Nottinghamshire debut in the NatWest Pro40 fixture against Durham at Trent Bridge on August 19.</p> <p>\"Ashwell has shown in this series that he's a match-winner and the fact that he's already in England with his family added to the attraction of signing him,\" Newell said. \"He's in form and it's always good to sign a player who is playing with confidence. He'll join us at a vital stage of the season and add quality to our middle order. He's an excellent fielder and he isn't involved in South Africa's one-day international fixtures so he fits the bill for perfectly.\"</p> <p>Prince pronounced himself pleased to be joining the high-flying county. <br>\"Nottinghamshire are in contention for silverware and I'm confident that I can add some experience to the team at an important stage of the season. I know that I am joining a competitive team and I have kept my eye on the results ever since the interest was expressed.\"</p> <p>He also revealed that he had consulted a member of the Test opposition for details about his new side. \"I spoke to Stuart Broad at Headingley long before the deal was concluded and he told me that the set-up was good and that Trent Bridge is a great place to play cricket. A lot of quality overseas players have gone before me at Notts and I want to score runs for the team.\"</p> <p>Prince has impressed on South Africa's current tour of England, proving adept at handling both the English conditions and bowlers. He has averaged over 75 from the first three Tests, with two centuries and a top score of 149.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's 15-year-long period of steady growth is at risk from a series of interlocking shocks that will prevent the Bank of England from cutting interest rates as the economy slows sharply, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a> warned today. </p> <p>In its regular health check of the UK, the Washington-based fund pared its forecasts for growth in both 2008 and 2009 and warned the Bank against cutting interest rates at a time when inflationary pressure was high and the government was allowing its budget deficit to rise. </p> <p>The IMF said it expected the UK to expand by 1.4% this year and 1.1% in 2009; in May, it forecast 1.75% expansion in both years. </p> <p>In what it described as a \"difficult context\", the fund said it was important for the Bank and the Treasury to ensure the credibility of economic policy. </p> <p>Released on the eve of the latest interest rate decision from the Bank, the IMF paints a far darker picture of the UK economy than it has in recent years. </p> <p>In addition to highlighting rising inflation and slowing growth, the report said the UK had been struggling with two new international shocks - the turmoil in financial markets and the spiralling cost of fuel and food. </p> <p>\"The combined effects of these shocks raised uncertainty, increased inflation risks and compounded the ongoing correction in the domestic housing market,\" the IMF said. \"A run on Northern Rock, a medium-sized mortgage lender, raised the spectre of financial stability weakness feeding through to the real sector.\" </p> <p>The fund said the government was now on course to breach its 2% inflation target for \"an extended period\" and was likely to break one of its two fiscal rules - keeping public debt below 40% of GDP. </p> <p>\"So far in 2008, evidence points to a sharp slowing in activity alongside high inflation,\" the IMP says. \"Second quarter growth was weak, forward-looking indicators are gloomy, sterling money market spreads remain elevated, unemployment has edged up and house prices are falling rapidly.\" </p> <p>The fund said it could find little evidence that higher food and fuel prices would trigger an upward spiral in the annual increase in the cost of living as wages remained subdued. But with inflation at 3.8%, it expressed concern that the public's expectation of future inflation had edged up. </p> <p>\"Given the outlook for inflation and the stance of fiscal policy, (IMF) directors saw little scope for monetary easing at present\". </p> <p>Following a decade of what it called \"sustained strong economic performance\", the IMF said the UK was now facing \"several concomitant shocks\". It added that the policy frameworks that had \"underpinned this remarkable performance will be tested by lower growth, higher inflation from food and fuel price increases, ongoing strains in financial markets, rapid house price reversals and medium term external imbalances. The financial sector strains have also triggered a broad-based effort to reform the financial stability framework\". </p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, has already said the government would allow borrowing to rise in the current downturn, even if that meant the 40% debt ceiling was breached. </p> <p>The IMF said today it wanted the discipline to be retained, but there should be \"concrete and frontloaded\" plans to bring debt back below 40% should the limit be exceded.</p>",
  "<p>The president of Mauritania was today deposed in a coup led by the former chief of his official guard, who appointed himself the head of a junta ruling the west African nation.</p> <p>Troops seized Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who became Mauritania's first democratically elected leader last year, after he announced the dismissal of four generals, one of them the coup leader, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.</p> <p>A brief announcement, read out on state television several hours after the president was detained, said Abdel Aziz would head a new \"state council\" to govern the former French colony, that recently became Africa's newest oil-producing nation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.ami.mr/fr/defaultfr.htm\">copy of the announcement </a>on the state-run L'Agence Mauritienne d'Information website also said that this morning's decree by the \"former president\" sacking Abdel Aziz and the other generals had been annulled.</p> <p>Mauritania has suffered several coups since gaining independence at the end of 1960.</p> <p>The last one, in 2005 \u2013 also led by Abdel Aziz - toppled the long-serving president, Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, who himself taken power in a coup in 1984. Abdallahi took power after the military regime allowed elections.</p> <p>Today's coup was swiftly condemned by both the African Union and EU, the latter group saying that it put a question mark over more than \u00a3120m of planned European aid for the country.</p> <p>The US state department also expressed its concern. \"This was a democratically elected, constitutional government and we condemn the act,\" Gonzalo Gallegos, a spokesman, told reporters.</p> <p>Today the new junta did not specify why they had ousted the president. According to some reports Abdallahi had angered elements in the military by opening talks with Islamist hardliners accused of having links with al-Qaida-affiliated groups.</p> <p>Last year, separate attacks blamed on Islamist militants targeted the Israeli embassy in Nouakchott and killed four French tourists.</p> <p>Today's coup appeared largely bloodless. Soldiers were sent out onto the streets of the capital and staff were ordered out of the state TV and radio stations but there were no reports of fighting.</p> <p>The president's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, told French radio that troops arrived at the presidential palace shortly before 9.30am local time (1030 BST).</p> <p>\"The president has just been arrested by a commando, who came to fetch him, arrested him here and took him away,\" she told RFI radio. \"This is a real coup d'etat.\"</p> <p>Mauritania has been in the throes of a political crisis in recent weeks. On Monday, almost 50 MPs quit the ruling party following a vote of no confidence in the government.</p> <p>The immediate catalyst for the coup appears to have been Abdallahi's decree today sacking Abdel Aziz and the three other generals. It was not clear, however, if the dismissals were themselves prompted by reports that the men were plotting to remove the president.</p> <p>Mauritania became Africa's newest oil-producing country after offshore fields began operating in 2006. </p> <p>The largely desert nation borders Algeria to the north and Mali and Senegal to the south and east.</p> <p>Despite hopes of prosperity from the country's still mainly unexploited reserves of oil and gas, it remains desperately poor and imports more than 70% of its food.</p> <p>It also faces pressure from international human rights groups to eliminate slavery, which they say remains widespread despite being outlawed in 1981. </p> <p>It was only last year that Mauritania's parliament voted through a law penalising slavery with jail terms of up to 10 years. Some groups estimate that up to 20% of the country's 3 million-strong population are slaves.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain has a novel idea. The crises of the world, from Darfur to democracy rollback, require urgent action the UN is incapable of delivering. So why not form a body of likeminded and democratic members with basically similar powers to those of the UN but minus the Belaruses and Burmas of the world?</p> <p>That is the logic behind McCain's <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/Read.aspx?guid=43e821a2-ad70-495a-83b2-098638e67aeb\">League of Democracies</a>, which, aside from his support for the surge in Iraq, would provide the backbone of his foreign policy. \"It would be the one organisation where the world's democracies could come together to discuss problems and solutions on the basis of shared principles and a common vision of the future,\" according to McCain. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/26/819810.aspx\">plan</a> sounds peachy. After all, who isn't in favour of \"discussing solutions\" and finding \"a common vision\"? Such a league would ostensibly serve as a check against autocratic role models and UN obstructionists like China and Russia. It would restore American leadership in the world. And it would jumpstart democracy promotion as an ideal worth pursuing after the badly managed detour in Iraq.</p> <p>But the plan, hatched in the halls of neoconservative thinktanks, has Republicans divided. In his New York Times column last week, David Brooks called the league \"the best idea floating around\" for likeminded democracies to \"wield authority\" abroad. Yet <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/07/29/john-bolton-questions-mccains-foreign-policy-proposals/?mod=hpp_asia_blogs\">John Bolton</a>, who would prefer to see the UN sink into the East River, recently predicted that \"Ultimately [the league] will go nowhere.\"</p> <p>Bolton, like stopped clocks, is right once in awhile. After all, the league's creation rests on the fantastic notion that all democracies think alike or project their interests abroad in some uniform fashion. If so, then why were so many democracies against the Iraq war? And democracies, especially European ones fighting in Afghanistan under the Nato banner, often cannot even agree on rules of engagement during times of war. </p> <p>Plus, how can a body that excludes two of the world's fastest growing countries (and nuclear powers to boot), Russia and China, not to mention the entire Muslim world outside of Turkey and Indonesia, really have any legitimacy or moral authority? Wouldn't its creation just needlessly alienate these states or, worse, spur them to form their own bloc, a bad rerun of the cold war? </p> <p>The problem with ideas like the League of Democracies is they assume a world of good actors versus bad actors, a reductive view of foreign affairs. But the world, of course, is more complex than that. Non-democracies are often needed to resolve crises. Recall the useful pressure China put on North Korea to come clean on its nukes. </p> <p>Plus, as <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=20135\">Thomas Carothers of the Carnegie Endowment</a> points out, we've been down this road before. Think back to Clinton's 2000 Community of Democracies (never heard of it? You're not alone), whose touchy-feely mission statement echoes McCain's league. The group has done little to advance democracy abroad except to scold Burma in 2003 about its lack of elections. A lot of good that did.</p> <p>The truth of the matter is this so-called league would be perceived as nothing more than a rubberstamp shop with the same moral authority of President Bush's \"coalition of the willing\". And though McCain insists it will serve as a complement to similar international institutions, its promotion would only weaken the UN, which is just beginning to make small progress in places like Iran and Darfur.</p> <p>Like it or not, the UN still has the moral, legal and logistical capacity to sanction war and mobilise resources after major crises. (Disclosure: I occasionally consult for the UN's development agency.) Of course it is a flawed, anachronistic and even hypocritical institution (ie sticking Libya on its human rights panel) that needs reforming (ie expanding the security council). Plus every September the UN provides a forum for rogue leaders like <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/19/iran.un/index.html\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/21/usa.venezuela\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> to thumb their nose at the American way of life before retreating to their five-star hotel up the block. But were major democracies to jump ship or curb their funding, the sidelining of the UN would wipe away a vital pillar of international affairs. </p> <p>McCain likes to trumpet his battle-tested fitness and foreign policy credentials as his chief advantages over his opponent. But his recent ideas abroad reflect those of someone who's snoozed through the last, say, 72 years of history, not those of a seasoned realist. On this issue, McCain is in a league of his own.</p>",

The four staged their protest near the landmark Bird's Nest stadium, the main venue for the games, where the opening ceremony will take place.</p> <p>The demonstration was one of several protests by foreigners in the city, underlining the clash between competing views of the Olympics. </p> <p>Thousands of euphoric, albeit carefully vetted, spectators cheered the arrival of the torch in Tiananmen Square. Crowds chanted: \"Go Olympics - go Beijing\" as the basketball star Yao Ming, one of the nation's biggest sporting heroes, carried the flame past the portrait of Mao Zedong that hangs on the Tiananmen gate.</p> <p>The celebrations are due to intensify tomorrow as world leaders begin arriving ahead of Friday's ceremony. But the US president may face a chilly reception after expressing \"deep concerns\" about China's lack of political freedom.</p> <p>According to an early release of a speech he will give in Thailand tomorrow, hours before catching a flight to Beijing, he will warn: \"America stands in firm opposition to China's detention of political dissidents, human rights advocates and religious activists.</p> <p>\"We speak out for a free press, freedom of assembly and labour rights \u2013 not to antagonise China's leaders, but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for China to develop its full potential.\"</p> <p>The foreign ministry last week condemned Bush's meeting prominent Chinese dissidents in Washington. It also accused US politicians of displaying \"evil motives\" and trying to \"sabotage the Olympics\" after the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning Beijing's record on human rights.</p> <p>But the debate over such issues shows no sign of fading, with activists launching a series of protests before the Olympics has even begun.</p> <p>In a phone call from his 15 metre-high protest point yesterday, the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2008/aug/06/china.olympics2008\">pro-Tibet campaigner Iain Thom</a> told supporters: \"We have done this action today to highlight the Chinese government's use of the Beijing Olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights.\" </p> <p>The state news agency, Xinhua, said police had ended the protest after 12 minutes, but the group Students for a Free Tibet said activists had been there for an hour before security officers led them away peacefully. It said Thom, 24, was from Scotland while another protester, Lucy Marion, 23, was from England.</p> <p>\"As far as we know, foreigners gathered illegally, and we express our strong opposition to that,\" said Sun Weide, a spokesman for the Beijing organising committee. We will resist all attempts to politicise the Olympics.\"</p> <p>\"We have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations, and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of China.\"</p> <p>Sun said the demonstrators had not been arrested or taken to a police station. No one had been able to contact the activists by this evening. The British embassy has requested immediate consular access.</p> <p>In a separate incident, a European activist arranged the screening of a film about Tibetan views of the Olympics in Beijing. The event was halted when his hotel asked reporters to leave, but public security officials waiting at the venue did not intervene directly.</p> <p>The Tibet issue has dogged the Olympics since March's violent riots in Lhasa and wider protests across Tibetan areas led to a security clampdown. Activists responded with demonstrations along the international leg of the torch relay, in turn sparking anger among the Chinese. </p> <p>Other protests today included a demonstration by three Americans who loudly denounced China's population control policies in Tiananmen Square after the torch had passed through. Police allowed them to leave the area after questioning them briefly.</p> <p>Journalists also received messages summoning them to two hotel rooms in Beijing containing dummies splattered with red paint. The walls had been defaced with slogans, including: \"One World, Our Nightmare\" - a play on the Olympic \"One World, One Dream\" message - and a list of jailed dissidents. It was not clear who had carried out the protest.</p> <p>The US swimmer Amanda Beard, an Athens 2004 gold medallist, unveiled an anti-fur advert outside the Olympic village after the authorities prevented her from staging a news conference in a hotel for \"safety\" reasons.</p> <p>The government has designated zones for protest in parks around the city, but human rights campaigners warn that Chinese citizens will be deterred from taking part by the fear of reprisals, and several groups have already been denied permits.</p> <p>Other activists have been unable to enter the country. Team Darfur, a coalition of athletes seeking to draw attention to the conflict in Sudan, said that Beijing yesterday revoked the visa of its co-founder, the Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek.</p> <p>Emmanuelle Moreau, an International Olympic Committee spokeswoman, said organisers should expect people to use the platform of the Olympics to draw attention to their causes.</p> <p>She said: \"The IOC are confident Beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding.\"</p>",

But the Home Office model of personal identity is that the infallible file determines the person, and the official document is a magic fragment of the file.</p> <p>The e-passport standard was pushed through the International Civil Aviation Organisation in the first part of this decade. It was largely devised by the US and UK authorities. New passports of all participating countries are designed to do what they have just been demonstrated to do. The whole point is for the chips to be programmable and that they cough up, on proper-seeming demand, everything about you that's on the passport. It isn't a bug; it's a feature. That information is intended to be captured, copied, stored, transmitted and collated. In e-borders schemes it will be automatically compared with ticket data, no-fly-lists, suspect lists and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/06/theairlineindustry.politics\">other official lists</a> \u2013 in order to, as the UK Border Agency so comfortingly puts it: \"keep a comprehensive record of everyone who crosses our border\". The same motivation is at work as with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/23/uksecurity.terrorismandtravel\">passenger name record data-sharing</a>.</p> <p>A biometric passport designed with the security of the document and the holder uppermost in mind would use the same technology but in a very different way. A digital signature can verify the document without any requirement to take data from it. If there's a biometric template encoded on the document, then in principle it can be verified at the point of checking as matching the person and their passport or visa \u2013 without the information being recorded or passed elsewhere. Just as the human immigration officer doesn't need to copy your passport photo in order to check it looks enough like you, neither does an electronic one matching your fingerprints. Doing it that way would be cheaper, much more private from the traveller's point of view, and less easy to cheat than a combination of massive databases of travel movements and personal details squirted everywhere. It doesn't even need the IPS to have a database of passport holders \u2013 though one for lost passports would be unexceptionable.</p> <p>If you must have a watchlist then that can work the same way. Does this name/picture on the separately verified document match the list? If no, do nothing \u2013 no information need be kept \u2013 if yes, perform more checks.</p> <p>The trouble is not technology. It is not expense. It is that world officialdom would much rather track us all around, so that if the detail of our movements might be useful to someone in authority one day, it will have been secured.</p>",
  "<h2>Criticism of police investigation from the Portuguese legal system</h2> <p>Portuguese prosecutors ridiculed detectives investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance for uncovering \"very little\" conclusive evidence about the child's fate, the newly released files have revealed.</p> <p>The damning report, made public as part of the massive dossier of evidence assembled over more than 14 months, even compared local investigators unfavourably with Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes.</p> <p>Written by public prosecutors in Portimao and dated July 21 \u2013 the day the case was officially shelved \u2013 the document said the investigation had not been able to find any proof which would allow \"the formulation of any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion\" about the circumstances of the girl going missing. It continued: \"This includes the most dramatic thing, ascertaining whether she is still alive or dead \u2013 which seems the most probable.\"</p> <p>\"The investigators are fully conscious that their work is not exempt from imperfections. They worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results, especially about the fate of the unfortunate child.</p> <p>\"This is not, unfortunately, a detective novel, a crime scenario fit for the investigative efforts of a Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice can always re-establish order.\"</p> <p>The 58-page report written by public prosecutors Jose de Magalhaes e Menezes and Joao Melchior Gomes was contained in the final volume of the files released to the media this week.</p> <h2>Prosecutors on McCanns' actions and their treatment by police</h2> <p>The prosecutors' report said Madeleine's parents did not \"act with intent\" in leaving their children alone in their holiday apartment the night the child went missing.</p> <p>\"They could not predict that in the resort they chose to spend their holidays they could place the life of any of their children in danger.\" </p> <p>They also noted that: \"We must also recognise that the parents are paying a heavy penalty \u2014 the disappearance of Madeleine \u2014 for their carelessness in monitoring and protecting their children.</p> <p>It went on: \"While it is a fact that Madeleine disappeared, the circumstances of how this happened is not known.</p> <p>\"Even if, as a hypothesis, that Gerald and Kate could have been responsible for the death of the child, it would always be left to explain how, where, when, with what means, with whose help they disposed of the body.\"</p> <p>It highlighted their \"normal behaviour adopted before and after the disappearance.\" </p> <p>It said: \"In reality, none of the suspicions which led to them being made arguidos came to be confirmed later.\"</p> <h2>McCanns' anger at police refusal to publicise e-fits of a suspect</h2> <p>Two strikingly similar e-fit pictures which were compiled from sightings were not released to the public or the McCanns until after the investigation had been shelved.</p> <p>Police were told by tourist Derek Flack that he had seen a man acting suspiciously around the McCanns' holiday apartment just before their daughter went missing. </p> <p>Lance Purser, a British expatriate, said he had seen a similar man in the area in the weeks leading up to Madeleine's disappearance.</p> <p>Both gave statements to the police three days after the child vanished and helped compile the e-fits. The two men described a young, white man with dark, deep set eyes and dark hair. </p> <p>Despite the similarities in the two descriptions detectives chose to keep the pictures secreted in their files. </p> <p>The McCanns had publicised a series of e-fits and sketches of suspects seen outside their apartment but they we unable to act on these two because police did not even tell them of their existence. </p> <p>After the release of the dossier containing the pictures, spokesman for the McCanns, Clarence Mitchell said it was \"outrageous\" that virtually none of the evidence had been show to the couple before the release of the case files and said their team of private detectives would investigate all the missed leads.</p> <p>\"It is frustrating beyond words and the worst thing is that all this time Madeleine has been let down by this lack of apparent coordination. It is one of the mysteries of the whole thing and it is tragic that it should come this late on,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><br>Black in the day ... Cilla presenting ITV's Blind Date</p> <p>She is \"the undisputed queen of the dating show\", says Sky One controller Richard Woolfe. \"There's been many pretenders to her throne, but she remains in a class of her own.\" You heard right - Cilla Black is back <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/06/bskyb.television\">as the presenter of Loveland</a>, Sky's modern take on the dating show.</p> <p>No doubt Cilla will be all \"don't call it a comeback\" as since her on-air resignation from Blind Date she's fronted <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a17786/cilla-live-flops-for-living-tv.html\">Cilla Live</a> and been a judge on Soapstar Superstar. But this is a return to the big time for the entertainer with the effortless common touch and the voice of wet concrete hitting a landfill. </p> <p>If the show's format depends on her it will be a winner. And let's hope it is because, properly handled, dating shows make terrific viewing. But this is television where the evil triumph and no good deed goes unrewarded, so sleaze, opportunism and exploitation are never far away.</p> <p>The dating show genre has produced its share of crass clinkers. We had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA8Vm4SWgeE\">Rock of Love</a> With Bret Michaels, which featured 20 groupie hopefuls fighting it out for dates with the Poison frontman and <a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Pamela-Anderson-Battles-Over-The-Sex-Tape-With-Bret-Michaels-8408.shtml\">sometime reluctant porn star</a>, and degraded women, music, and all human feeling and life itself in the process.</p> <p>Then there was ITV's cretinous, misandrist <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0204097/\">Man O' Man</a>, where losing male contestants were pushed into a swimming pool in front of the 300-strong hen party-on-crystal-meth audience. If I can quote <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/ellis_carver.shtml\">Sergeant Ellis Carver</a>, \"Where is the love? Where is the motherfucking love?\"</p> <p>It doesn't have to be like this. I recall watching BBC's Would Like to Meet team helping Esther Rantzen get back in the dating game after her husband's death - an authentically moving show that had genuine relevance to many of the viewers. Then, post-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game:_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists\">The Game</a>, we've seen the birth of straight-up pickup shows like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRYmSeFZvIU\">Keys to the VIP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3fTXvCkS0\">The Pickup Artist</a>.</p> <p>While some dismiss these shows as sleazy, The Pickup Artist in particular has a genuine desire to improve its participants' lives and relations with women. It's part of the tradition of makeover and self-improvement shows that at least offer the prospect of a happier life for the contestants, and a chance for the viewer to connect emotionally in a way that doesn't involve spewing abuse at them on Internet forums.</p> <p>I'm not passing judgement here. I've watched every dating show going and the cheaper, crueller and more exploitative they are the more difficult it is to tear myself away. But there's got to be a line drawn somewhere. Television drips with bad intention these days - the weekly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dke5W5aU8XM\">Elstree mob</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm9jBH7ufRU\">X-Factor freakshow</a> and a general contempt for reality TV participants pervades.</p> <p>Wouldn't it be actually nice to help basically nice but emotionally inept people take control of their love lives? Or just get through a reality TV series without some ritual humiliation? A radical concept, I know, but worth pursuing.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2004, it wasn't just presidential platforms that voters were buzzing about. A sweeping number of conservative ballot initiatives that Karl Rovians hoped would draw conservative and evangelical voters to the polls also had pundits and pollsters chattering. You might remember the \"values voters\". They were the mythical independent voters wooed by those who hoped that values might be defined as discriminating against gay men and lesbians, immigrants and equal opportunity. And the Democrats <a href=\"http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=weddingbell_blues\">fell down</a> on these ballot initiatives, panicked about pointing out the obvious discriminatory nature of the measures, hoping they would go away on their own.</p> <p>In the first flush of recriminations after the elections, values voters were blamed for John Kerry's loss. Democrats wrung their hands about gay marriage in Massachusetts having had a negative impact on their Election Day results, when what was really needed was a hard, introspective look at what these ballot initiatives meant for the Democratic party, and for America.</p> <p>Lately there's been little talk about these values, those voters and that kind of conservative election tactic. But the ballot initiatives? <a href=\"http://www.ballot.org/vertical/Sites/%7B26C6ABED-7A22-4B17-A84A-CB72F7D15E3F%7D/uploads/%7B7975768F-3116-4FBA-A32F-00D85059253E%7D.PDF\">They fester on</a> (pdf). Across the country, states are circulating petitions \u2013 and in some cases have already ensured the place of \u2013 a series of \u00fcber-conservative ballot questions that range from restricting abortion access to taking away rights from non-married (read: aimed at gay) couples to affirmative action.</p> <p>Start in Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee John McCain's own state. Last week McCain reversed his earlier position on an anti-affirmative action ballot initiative \u2013 wolf-in-sheep's clothing like called the \"Arizona Civil Rights Initiative\" \u2013 telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/07/mccain-reverses.html\">\"I support it\"</a>, even though just a few years ago he rejected a similarly worded measure as \"divisive\".</p> <p>Voters will be asked to agree with McCain on the following statement: \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, colour, ethnicity or national origin, in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting.\" (Bankrolled by Ward Connelly, a similarly worded initiative will appear in Nebraska and Missouri).</p> <p>Arizona has some other fun ones currently circulating, including one that would ban the issuance of <a href=\"http://www.law.arizona.edu/news/Press/Silverman120707.pdf\">birth certificates</a> (pdf) to children born to undocumented workers. In that same vein, Oregon and Missouri have put English-only measures up for a vote. Oregon would ban the teaching of foreign languages in ESL courses for the next two years (meaning a forced English immersion to foreign students - a tactic that hasn't worked elsewhere). <a href=\"http://www.proenglish.org/states/missouri.htm\">Missouri</a> would ensure that no language other than English was spoken at public meetings regarding public legal issues.</p> <p>Harkening back to the battles of 2004, Arizona also has a Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) referred to the ballot. That anti-gay measure joins California's Doma, Florida's so-called \"super Doma\" and Arkansas' effort to prevent any non-married persons from adopting children. Each of these so-called marriage protecting amendments \u2013 sweeping measures structured by homophobia and the hopes of undermining the rights of gay men and lesbians \u2013 should be a concern to <em>all</em> Americans. If the mere discriminatory nature of these efforts \u2013 to strip domestic partnership benefits, adoption rights and other simple legal pleasures enjoyed by heterosexual partnerships \u2013 aren't enough to galvanise the general population to action, there are plenty of reasons unmarried heterosexuals might want to take notice as well.</p> <p>Ultimately, in their aggressive march to undermine the rights of fellow Americans, these measures end up discriminating against all unmarried people. When Ohio passed its anti-gay marriage amendment in 2004, the state inadvertently undermined the ability of unmarried individuals to sue for domestic abuse violations. If you weren't married, you weren't being battered. Surely that lesson alone should be enough to shake even those voters apathetic about gay rights. </p> <p>The perennial conservative effort to restrict abortion access continues through ballot initiatives as well. South Dakota - the state known for multiple attempts to single-handedly overturn Roe v Wade, including a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/19/AR2008071901586.html\">measure</a> that went into effect in mid July that requires doctors to tell prospective abortion candidates that the procedure \"will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique living human being\" - will be voting on a ballot initiative that would ban all abortions except in cases of rape or incest. California has proposed a controversial <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PIMA.pdf\">parental notification law</a> (pdf) even though <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/06/national/06abortion.html\">studies</a> have shown that such laws have not measurably lowered abortion rates. (In fact, a 2006 New York Times study found that, counter-intuitively, sometimes it was parents that pushed for the abortion).</p> <p>Finally Colorado has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/12/AR2008071201615.html\">\"definition of personhood\"</a> proposal on the ballot that would declare \"fertilisation\" as the moment that life begins. That means fertilised eggs will have the same rights as people \u2013 a definition that carries complications far beyond the abortion debate. The fertility industry, for one, often if not always, fertilises many more eggs than an infertile couple will implant in the hopes of childbearing. If Colorado has its way, those zygotes will have the same rights as people. The proposed law would also have an impact on the use of IUDs and the morning after pill (which prevent implantation rather than fertilisation), as well as some birth control pills. And it will potentially implicate a woman who miscarries or engages in any behaviour that might be deemed harmful (smoking or drinking or using drugs) while pregnant, an issue that has already become a hot issue <a href=\"http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org\">in other states</a>.</p> <p>The big question for conservatives and liberals alike is what impact these initiatives will have on the race for the White House. Affirmative action, abortion and anti-gay measures can serve as <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/07/30/whats-coming-your-ballot-this-fall\">wedge issues</a>, painting a candidate in one direction or another, and thus woo a crucial several thousand votes. In 2006, stem cells did exactly that, in the tight Senate race between <a href=\"http://www.stateline.org/live/details/story?contentId=146780\">Claire McCaskill and Jim Talent in Missouri</a>, giving the margin of error to McCaskill, the Democrat. But all too often progressives are on the losing side the ballot initiative gamble.</p> <p>Currently, the conventional wisdom is the blowback from this year's ballot initiatives will be <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/no_20080725_2366.php\"> minimal</a> - but that dismissal comes with caveats. Engaging in debate sparked by these ideologically slanted ticket-fillers is a losing proposition for any candidate, embroiling them in dirty, overly specific, no-win battles fiercely defended by highly partisan splinter groups that can only damage the general reputation of the politician.</p> <p>For those ballot initiatives that are already set for November in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Colorado, the hope is that the sticky space will be <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-ballot29-2008jul29,0,845120.story\">shared by McCain</a> who will have to take politically impossible positions (the \"personhood\" measure, for one, has divided conservatives, and flip-flopping on affirmative action only hurts). But for those measures still in the petition stage, Democrats should work while they can to keep them from ever hitting the ballot, fighting them on their dubious constitutionality and their distasteful, and anti-American, discriminatory messages.</p>",
  "<p>The Office of Fair Trading is preparing to press price-fixing charges against four former and current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairwaysbusiness\">British Airways</a> executives, and an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow.</p> <p>It is understood that individual charges will be brought against Andrew Crawley, BA's head of sales, former marketing director Martin George, the ex-communications head Iain Burns and Alan Burnett, who once ran UK and Ireland sales for the airline. The men were on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/25/britishairways\">the list of 10 former and current BA executives identified by the US government as being liable to possible extradition and prosecution</a> over a scandal that has already cost BA around \u00a3270m in fines.</p> <p>However, anyone acquitted or convicted of price-fixing in the UK cannot be charged with the same offence in the US - lessening the chances of the four executives being extradited if they are charged by the OFT. Price-fixing carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail under UK law. Three British businessmen - Peter Whittle, David Brammar and Bryan Allison - were jailed for between two-and-a-half and three years each in June for cartel offences under the Enterprise Act in a case brought by the OFT over price-fixing of marine hoses.</p> <p>The OFT and BA declined to comment today. BA was fined \u00a3121.5m by the OFT and $300m (\u00a3150m) by the US department of justice last year for colluding over the setting of fuel-surcharges for cargo and long-haul passenger flights. The most high-profile offence related to a price-fixing scam that BA operated in tandem with Virgin Atlantic, a close rival that escaped prosecution by blowing the whistle on the collusion and calling regulators.</p> <p>George and Burns left BA in October 2006. George left with a compensation package worth up to \u00a31.6m and has yet to find a full-time job while Burns has moved to Dubai where he is employed by the Etihad airline. George admitted in his resignation statement that his department might have discussed surcharges with a competitor - strictly against competition laws and BA's own guidelines. George said there might have been \"inappropriate conversations\". It is alleged that BA contacted arch-rival Virgin Atlantic through its press department about plans to raise fuel surcharges, which are a levy imposed on passengers to cover the rising cost of oil.</p> <p>BA chief executive Willie Walsh has described the law breach as \"deeply regrettable\" and last year said he would be \"very happy\" to see full details of the scandal emerge in court because people \"deserve to know what happened\". When asked if he was referring to Virgin Atlantic's role in the cartel, Walsh said he could not comment on the individuals or companies involved. BA is still paying for the collusion, along with Virgin Atlantic.</p> <p>Both airlines have established <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/16/theairlineindustry.britishairwaysbusiness\">a \u00a3100m compensation fund</a> for passengers who were caught out by the price-fixing, which took place between August 2004 and January 2006. UK-based customers who took a long-haul flight between those periods are entitled to a payout of up to \u00a320 per return ticket, depending on the size of the fuel levy when the ticket was booked. The compensation, which is available until 2012, will apply to more than 8 million BA and Virgin Atlantic customers based in the UK and the US.</p> <p>It is understood that the remaining six former BA employees remain under investigation by the department of justice.</p>",

The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains by Owen Wister </h2> <p>In the 1880s a weedy Easterner named Owen Wister had something like a nervous breakdown. Wyoming, with its wide-open spaces and healthy pursuits, was prescribed as a cure. Wister was immediately smitten by the taciturn cowboys and the rules imposed upon them by the cattle barons. Collecting his notes he produced the novel that is the western's sine qua non. It was Gary Cooper, I think, who first spoke the immortal line on camera: \"When you call me that, smile!\" Researching for my own book I came upon the Occidental Hotel in Buffalo, Wyoming, where I was shown the very room in which Wister composed a part of his masterpiece. Some claim it was the very room whither the Virginian repaired to claim his Molly after his climactic shoot-out with Trampas. A good corrective to Wister's world view - in which the cattle barons (the \"quality\") were born justified - is Michael Cimino's unfairly vilified Heaven's Gate. </p> <h2>2. The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald</h2> <p>Although set on the eastern seaboard the story it tells, as its narrator himself observes, is really about the West. But that admission is not the primary reason for Scott Fitzgerald's novel to be invited into the Western Hall of Fame; no, it has more to do with the metamorphosis of Jimmy Gatz into Jay Gatsby. The process begins in childhood (evidenced by a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy, into which Gatsby-to-be had inscribed a strict daily timetable, and a list of general resolves), and concludes when he meets a mentor surnamed Cody. The name of course is a signal. It broadcasts that Jay Gatsby reborn is a part of that line of self-made westerners that begins with the scout whose exploits reenacted thrilled the Crowned Heads of Europe; none other than Buffalo Bill Cody. On top of all that is the fact that the book concludes with the necessary shoot-out. </p> <h2>3. The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones by Charles Neider </h2> <p>The title is a variation upon the one devised by Pat Garrett to tell the story of his dance of death with Billy the Kid. As well as changing the name of the protagonist, Neider altered the location from New Mexico to California. Hendry's tale is narrated by an old compadre named Doc Baker, whose laconic voice persuades the reader that his descriptions of deed and landscape are indeed as authentic as promised. To add conviction, Neider rode for days on end through the canyons of California, wore a Colt .45 on his hip, and practised drawing the gun until his fingers bled. Marlon Brando wasn't quite so bothered when he purchased the movie rights, changed the title to One-Eyed Jacks, and sacked Doc Baker. He took to wearing his pistol in a cummerbund. \"What's your opinion of that?\" Neider was asked. \"First time he'd draw that gun he'd blow his balls off,\" he replied. Sam Peckinpah was the original screenwriter on the project. He called Neider \"Master\" and picked his brains. If you ask me, his subsequent version of the story owes a lot to Neider the Master.</p> <h2>4. True Grit by Charles Portis </h2> <p>One-eyed Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn is the role that finally delivered John Wayne his Oscar. But this is where the character began. Young Mattie Ross (aged 14), a girl blessed with precocious and ferocious pedantry, leaves her farm in Arkansas to avenge the murder of her father at the hands of a man named Chaney (a prescient touch that), and en route meets his one-eyed nemesis. But Portis spares neither Chaney nor Cogburn. Instead of riding off into the sunset, only to reappear in a sequel, Cogburn suffers a miserable decline (which includes taking the wrong side in the Johnson County War, provoked by Wister's impeccable cattlemen), and finally dies while employed as an actor in a Wild West show run by Cole Younger and Frank James, who have matured from murderous outlaws into old hams.</p> <h2>5. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford by Ron Hansen</h2> <p>Frank James reappears in this novel, of course, but his younger brother is its guiding light. Hansen tells a familiar story, but uses prose which is vibrant and original, which constantly magicks nouns and adjectives into verbs, into words of action, as if its hero had some direct line to the logos. This religious undercurrent finds further expression in the relationship between Jesse James and his killer, which echoes that between Christ and his red-headed betrayer. Equally scintillating is Hansen's companion volume Desperadoes, which tells the story of those lesser Kansas outlaws, the Dalton Gang.</p> <h2>6. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy</h2> <p>McCarthy's prose in Blood Meridian comes blazing from the Book of Revelation. Told through the eyes of a young runaway this blood-soaked and blood-crazed novel details the death, destruction and disease doled out by four dozen horsemen of the apocalypse as they traverse America's southern borderline. Their leader, the Judge. is Manifest Destiny personified, in all its compulsive and repulsive glory. An altogether cooler and less febrile version of America's Westward expansion may be found in Blood and Thunder, a popular history by Hampton Sides.</p> <h2>7. Close Range &amp; Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 1 &amp; 2 by Annie Proulx </h2> <p>First, there were the dinosaurs whose bones sleep in Wyoming's bedrock. Next came the mammals: the elk, the moose, the bison and the wolf. Co-existing with them (though not necessarily with each other) were the Cheyenne, the Crow, and the Sioux. Then came the ranchers and the oilmen, And finally came Annie Proulx, who describes the sorry state to which all have fallen with prose that is beady-eyed, lyrical. cold-blooded, and with a hell of a bite.</p> <h2>8. Stories from Mesa Country by Jane Candia Coleman</h2> <p>As Annie Proulx is to Wyoming, so is Jane Candia Coleman to Arizona. Her prose is as pared down as the land she inhabits. But there is stark beauty in it too. Mesa Country, as described by Coleman, is a merciless place, but amid the death and disappointment are rare moments of compassion and conjuncture, as when an outlaw on the run finds strange (though brief) comfort in the home of a lonely woman. Coleman's book is divided between Then &amp; Now: Then being the 1880s, when Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday made a fearsome duo in Tombstone. It is no coincidence that Coleman is married to the historian Glenn G Boyer, whose expertise on Earp et al is beyond compare.</p> <h2>9. Snow Mountain Passage by James D Houston</h2> <p>For a couple of years James D Houston was my near-neighbour in Santa Cruz. The house in which he lived had once belonged to Patty Reed, who as a young girl had been a member of the infamous Donner Party, that band of unfortunate emigrants who had been trapped by winter in the Sierras. Beginning in 1920, with Patty Reed (by then 82) sitting on her porch and contemplating the Pacific's eternal ebb and flow, Houston's novel goes on to recount the Donner Party's ghastly journey from her point of view. Somehow Houston manages to make real not only the stoical calm of an old woman looking back, but also the untested sensibility of an eight-year-old, open to wild adventure and incredible privation (that ended in cannibalism). </p> <h2>10. Crazy Horse by Larry McMurtry</h2> <p>Perhaps I should have picked Lonesome Dove or even The Last Picture Show, but I felt there should be at least one book about the Sioux or the Apache on this list. And since so little is known about Crazy Horse this biography is of necessity speculation if not actual fiction. Nevertheless, McMurtry presents a convincing and sympathetic portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of the Wild West: never photographed or drawn, never quoted verbatim, and now resting in an unknown grave, Crazy Horse flits through history like a ghost, forever an absent presence, like all our pasts.</p>",

It was there that Dowling carved out tunnels, forged documents and prepared maps for the real-life escape that inspired the 1963 movie.</p> <p>His son revealed that the father-of-two \"wasn't a fan\" of the Steve McQueen epic and thought the famous but entirely fictitious motorbike scene was \"well over the top\".</p> <p>Peter Dowling, 60, a retired NHS accountant, said: \"Parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue. For someone who was actually there, that was upsetting.\"</p> <p>The RAF flight lieutenant wasn't thrilled that his story was dominated by Americans, either: \"He wasn't the greatest admirer of Americans and it didn't go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role,\" said Peter Dowling, who believes that Donald Pleasence's character, The Forger (Flight Lt Colin Blythe), was loosely based on his father.</p> <p>He said his father had been happy to reminisce about life at the camp, where he captained Stalag Luft's Somerset team, keeping a record of all the scores and averages of the batsmen and bowlers. He passed the time writing a diary and a book on wines and cocktails, learning five languages from other PoWs and getting to know the ace fighter pilot Douglas Bader.</p> <p>His most famous exploits came in early 1943 when he joined a group of men, led by Roger Bushell, to plot the breakout. The scheme involved hollowing out three tunnels, codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry, with each entrance carefully selected to ensure it was not spotted by guards.</p> <p>Despite playing a crucial part in the plan, Dowling was not one of the men selected for the final escape. Three men made it home to the UK, while 23 were recaptured. Of the 76 escapees, 50 were shot, seven of whom were friends of Dowling.</p> <p>\"He felt angry, more than angry, that Hitler had 50 of the 76 escapees shot, and my father was friends with seven of them,\" said Peter Dowling.</p> <p>It was the second time he had evaded death. Dowling missed a flight to Ireland on a bombing training mission in which the entire crew died. He never got over the guilt that he had survived.</p> <p>In 1945 he escaped death in near-arctic conditions when the camp was evacuated because of the advancing Soviet army. Many of his friends and fellow prisoners died in the harsh conditions.</p> <p>After the war, Dowling engaged in other battles, taking on Margaret Thatcher, who he petitioned to recognise the wrong done to PoWs when their pay was stopped during their time in captivity. </p> <p>A residential home in Nailsea that he moved to in 2003 was renamed Dowling House in his honour. The landlord, Peter White, added a plaque to the door and erected a mosaic displaying a picture of Dowling with a Wellington bomber in the background.</p> <p>Dowling moved to a nursing home in Stoke Bishop this year, where he died on July 21.</p>",
  "<p>A woman from Morocco, has lived in France for eight years with a French husband, has three French children and speaks fluent French, was refused citizenship recently on grounds of being insufficiently assimilated. The <a href=\"http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0820.shtml\">conseil d'etat said</a> Faiza Silmi's way of life does not reflect \"French values\", particularly the goal of gender equality. The judgment claims she lives in \"total submission\" to the men in her life because she wears the niqab, which covers all of the face except the eyes. The decision was approved by commentators from right, left and centre. Fadela Amara, the urban affairs minister, called Silmi's clothing a \"prison\" and a \"straitjacket\". Predictable debates about fundamentalism unfolded in the media, with Silmi appearing as a strange, distant object.</p> <p>What does Silmi herself say? The website <a href=\"http://www.jeuneafrique.com/\">Jeuneafrique.com</a> has just published her first interview with the French press, corroborating another in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/19/world/europe/19france.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=66a2d7d1e26a3089&amp;ex=1216612800&amp;exprod=myyahoo&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times</a>. Silmi's voice emerges clearly:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am not submissive to the men in my family nor do I lead the life of a recluse and I go out when I want. When I drive my car, I wear my niqab. I alone decided to wear it, after reading some books. I respect the law and my husband respects my decisions.</p> </blockquote> <p>While she talked, her husband served tea.</p> <p>There is no universally accepted definition of gender equality. <a href=\"http://www.niputesnisoumises.com/actualite.php?numactu=196\">For some</a>, the simple act of wearing a veil proves Silmi is oppressed. Others see her as having made choices, adapted, evolved. Silmi does not proselytise about religion or gender, but she does not like men staring at her in the street. While some observers interpret her adoption of more traditional clothes than she wore in Morocco as a sign of regression, Silmi demonstrates a typical migrant desire to validate the past while finding her way in a new life. This is a process and she may well change her style again in years to come. </p> <p>Candidates on dating sites like <a href=\"http://www.muslima.com/French/default.cfm\">Muslima.com</a> reveal an array of headgear. Some describe themselves as modest, long considered a positive trait. Are we now meant to believe that bare arms, face, calves, midriffs and cleavage are not simply fashion but a progressive state of dress? Societies teem with differing ideas about what kinds of clothing denotes modesty, liberation, oppression, equality, sexiness and beauty. One wonders whether the social workers and judges in Silmi's case believe no one influences their own clothing choices.</p> <p>Western societies like to think they are at the forefront of a cultural timeline that applies in the same way to all cultures. A neocolonialist predisposition to see migrant women as oppressed and backward becomes inevitable but, logically, if Silmi is insufficiently evolved then many women born in Europe also do not deserve their citizenship: those who stay with violent partners, perhaps, or who fail to work outside the home. </p> <p>Many countries require longtime foreign residents to pass language and culture tests before being allowed to naturalise. It would be nice to avoid judgments based on the most superficial and cliched of markers: how women look. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_53.htm\">Manhattan Institute</a> has produced an assimilation index comparing the census data of different migrant groups with the established US population. The measures are economic (jobs, education, home ownership), cultural (language, marriage, childbearing) and civic (naturalisation, military service). Most groups do better by one measure than others. In this scheme, Silmi's desire \u2013 and two attempts \u2013 to become French would count as indicating more assimilation. </p> <p>Instead, she and her husband feel alienated and rejected. What exactly did France gain with that result?</p>",
  "<p>The race to carve up the Arctic for its oil, gas and mineral reserves has been charted for the first time in an attempt to alert international policy makers to serious territorial disputes that could result.</p> <p> A <a href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/arctic.pdf\">new map (pdf)</a> is designed to illustrate historical, ongoing and potential arguments about ownership in the competition to control areas rich in natural resources. </p> <p>Its publication by Durham University researchers comes as a growing number of states including the UK cast their eyes towards polar regions and big slices of the ocean floors. </p> <p>Countries must establish sovereignty over disputed territories if they are to exploit their undiscovered, technologically recoverable energy reserves. </p> <p>The attempts to assert such rights have already alarmed conservationists who want better international protection for the poles as climate change melts the ice and opens up more land and seabeds for exploration.</p> <p>Last year, a Russian submarine planted a flag on the seabed below the North Pole to highlight its claim to a big chunk of the Arctic. Other disputes could involve Canada, US , Denmark (through Greenland), Iceland and Norway.</p> <p>The Arctic map has been prepared by Durham's International Boundaries Research Unit. </p> <p>Its director, Martin Pratt, said a survey by the US Geological Survey estimated that a fifth of the so-far undiscovered but recoverable resources lay within the Arctic Circle. \"We are talking 90 million barrels of oil, nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet. I cannot even imagine how much that is, but it is a lot. I suppose for any state, control is significant as other resources dwindle.\"</p> <p>Pratt said the map was an attempt \"to collate information and predict the way in which the Arctic region may eventually be divided up. The freezing land and seas of the Arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics.\" There was likely to be increasing concern over damage to the \"unique environment\" of the Arctic. </p> <p>\"It is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity.\"<br> Russia first made a submission about the areas to the UN over the area in 2001. Claims are made under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Coastal states can extend their rights beyond the 200-mile limit from their shoreline if there is a continental shelf. </p> <p>Russia claims its continental shelf extends along a mountain chain under the Arctic called the Lomonosov Ridge. Its flag-waving last year was part of its determination to provide more weight to the claim, which have to be verified by geological and sub-sea surveys.<br>The US has yet to even sign up to the UN convention</p>",
  "<p>A Mexican man at the centre of an international legal dispute has been executed in Texas for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in 1993.</p> <p>While protestors both for and against the death penalty demonstrated outside the Huntsville Unit near Houston last night, Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn, 33, died after being given a lethal injection. </p> <p>The execution came just before 10pm shortly after the US supreme court denied a last request for a reprieve. </p> <p>Pleas for a stay came from Washington, Mexico and the international court of justice (ICJ). </p> <p>They had all urged Texas not to execute Medell\u00edn until a hearing had been held to determine whether or not his original trial was sound.</p> <p>The state's Republican governor, Rick Perry, rebutted attempts to delay off the execution arguing that the state's courts were not bound by the rulings of the ICJ. </p> <p>The ICJ in the Hague had ordered Medell\u00edn's case and those of 50 other Mexicans on death row be reviewed because none had been informed of their right to consular assistance.</p> <p>The US state department said it was powerless to delay the execution, noting that the country's supreme court had ruled in March that president Bush did not have the authority to intervene in the case. </p> <p>The Mexican government has now sent a note of protest to the US state department, expressing \"its concern for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.\" <br> Medell\u00edn and five other teenage boys in his Houston street gang took part in the rape and murder of two girls, Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14, in 1993. </p> <p>Medell\u00edn, who was born in Mexico but moved to the US as a child, was convicted of Pena's murder and has never contested the conviction. <br>Two other members of the gang were also sentenced to die. Two had their sentences commuted to life in prison. The sixth, Medell\u00edn's brother, Vernacio, is serving a 40-year sentence. </p> <p>Medell\u00edn's case has become the focal point of the dispute between Mexico, which does not have the death penalty, and the US over whether or not some Mexicans on death row were denied fair trials because of the lack of consular access.</p> <p>The 1963 Vienna Convention, which both Mexico and the US signed, requires foreigners accused of crimes to be given that opportunity. </p> <p>Over the last five days, Medell\u00edn's lawyers tried to stop the execution by arguing to the Supreme Court that it should be put off until Congress had a chance to pass pending legislation that would require a review of similar cases. </p> <p>They argued that Medell\u00edn would be deprived of life without due process if he died before Congress acted.<br> But the court decided 5-4 that the possibility of congressional action was too remote to justify a stay. </p> <p>One member of the supreme court, justice Stephen Breyer wrote however, that to permit the execution would place the US \"irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises.\" </p> <p>Mexico, which opposes the death penalty, has used the Vienna convention on consular relations to try to block the executions of Medell\u00edn and 50 other Mexicans in the US. </p> <p>Twice in the last five years, the ICJ has said hearings should be held to determine if the 51 trials were fair. </p>",
  "<p> Too bad to be true? ... villains in the movie version of Shane. Photograph: Kobal</p> <p>I can't go to bed with John Wayne, so I do the next best thing: I go to bed with my girlfriend, who once met the great man. That's how much I love westerns. The word \"western\" usually refers to movies, of course, but there is a literary tradition of the same name that pre-dates the moving picture and retains its vitality yet.</p> <p>The first stampede of such texts could be rounded up and branded, \"How the West Was Won\". They concerned themselves with individual derring-do, Manifest Destiny, nation building, and the establishment of dynasties. The first whisperings of self-doubt could be heard as early as the 1920s, but it was only after Vietnam that <a href=\"http://westernamericana.blogspot.com/2005/05/what-happened-to-western-genre.html\">the old certainties vanished</a> as comprehensively as the buffalo and the passenger pigeon.</p> <p>Postmodernism merely delivered the coup de grace. How can anything be taken seriously when it is founded - at best - on dodgy realism? Ours is essentially a tragic age, but thanks to post-modernism we refuse to recognise it as such. Consider the fact that numerous aficionados of the Wild West - myself included - have elevated a single incident to stand for the whole darn show in microcosm. It involves the great scout (or hammer of the Navajo) <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/a_c/carson.htm\">Kit Carson</a>.</p> <p>The tale is told that in the December of 1849 a renegade band of Jicarilla Apaches attacked an emigrant wagon, murdered its driver, Mr White, and spirited away his bride and new-born. Carson was persuaded to lead a rescue party assembled by the military. Needless to say, the peerless scout succeeded in rooting out the Apaches, but was too late to save the unfortunate Mrs White, who was discovered with an arrow piercing her left breast (which remained warm to the touch). Among her possessions was discovered a well-thumbed copy of Kit Carson: The Prince of the Gold Hunters.</p> <p>Carson was unfamiliar with its contents, and would have remained so (being illiterate) had one of his companions not read the dime novel to him. What he heard occasioned him great upset. The cause was not the fact that his fictional alter ego was better looking, taller (the real Carson was a bantam at 5ft 4in), and silver tongued to boot, but that he had triumphed where the real Carson had failed, and had rescued a comely damsel from her savage captors.</p> <p>Ever after, or so he avowed in his (dictated) autobiography, he felt shame for the false comfort this particular scrape must have afforded its most eager reader, who so shortly afterwards became a rudely disillusioned corpse.</p> <p>How to account for so many different writers (half-a-dozen at least) all happening upon the same event? Coincidence or zeitgeist? The latter, I presume, because it illustrates the precise moment when reality met myth, when the West met the western. But there is a further twist: who can say that the figure looking aghast at his false representation is any more real? Isn't the Kit Carson who found the bloodied copy of The Prince of the Gold Hunters also a figure out of a book? The tragedy of the White family thus becomes a side-show in this prime demonstration of post-modern irony, in which history is nought but palimpsest upon palimpsest, commentary sans an ur-text.</p> <p>Of course the 19th century remained in blissful ignorance of post-modern irony, and the dime novels were made without end. Many of the later heroes who remain household names - such as Buffalo Bill, Jesse James, and Wyatt Earp - do so because they found their cut-price Boswells. Only when the Wild West became a place to eulogise, only when its heroes were dead or too old to lift a gun, was it considered a fit subject for more self-important scribes: <a href=\"http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/owister.htm\">Owen Wister</a>, author of The Virginian, being the genre's first and still most famous practitioner. Other authors - such as Zane Grey and Jack Schaefer - followed along the trail Wister blazed, but in truth their best works - Riders of the Purple Sage and Shane - are remembered not as books, but in their cinematic reincarnations. Both in one and three dimensions such heroes were stalwart, independent, ruthless, quick on the draw, and secure in both ideology and masculinity.</p> <p>Such self-assurance was obviously too good to be true. In 1935 Faber &amp; Faber published an anthology entitled My Best Western Story in which the genre's leading practitioners contributed what they considered their finest. Alas, literature the stories ain't, they appear more like fossils from a spent mine. To find the last true pickings from the motherlode better turn to <a href=\"http://www.elmoreleonard.com/\">Elmore Leonard's The Complete Western Stories</a> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2006), in which the interested reader can watch a fine writer serve his apprenticeship, and turn from novice to master. My preference is for works that assimilate post- modernism (or at least the idea that their subject matter is hokum) and yet still manage to excavate life's tragic core. What these books lack in optimism, they more than make up for in vitality, each being marked by a distinctive narrative voice that verges on a new idiolect.</p> <p><em>Read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/06/1\">Clive Sinclair's top 10 favourite westerns</a></em></p>",
  "<p><br>'Where are the genuinely effective uses of a sitar in pop?' ... Er, see the fellas above. Photograph: Corbis</p> <p>Last week, I lamented the decline in popularity of the guitar solo. Well, today I'm ignoring those cherished Fenders and listening out for alien-sounding instruments in pop.</p> <p>So what inspires musicians to abandon the conventional guitar/bass/drums setup and scour the Musicians' Union contacts book for a piccolo player? And, more importantly, when does it work?</p> <p>After the break, I reveal four of the more common reasons: </p> <p><strong>1. It validates the performer as a \"serious\" artist</strong> By this, I mean attempting to elevate one's music to the exalted status of classical or jazz by shoe-horning in instruments from those genres. There is an inferiority complex among certain pop musicians who are musically literate that is entirely unnecessary and leads to some awful hybrids. So boo to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTVnCyDoQlQ\">Snow Goose by Camel</a> whose woodwind quartet passage contains sub-GCSE pretensions, especially in the insistently irritating bassoon arpeggios, but hooray for the heroic <a href=\"http://www.olliehalsall.co.uk/\">Ollie Halsall</a> whose attempts to incorporate the vibraphone into pop music via 60s should-have-beens <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54On0uLtdJc\">Timebox</a> and in the 70s with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEa_jyOmveg&amp;feature=related\">jazz-rock oddballs Patto</a> are understated and tasteful.</p> <p><strong>2. It gives the music a smooooth vibe</strong> This typically means the ubiquitous 80s saxophone solo, an indicator that the music is oily enough to submerge yourself in prior to a cocktail-drinking competition in Monte Carlo. Again, real quality in this field is rare. Compare the token honking of the deeply unimaginative sax work on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9whJrLy7Nk\">Hall and Oates' Maneater</a> to Steely Dan's Aja. The former is a gradual restatement of the chorus melody, adding an extra note each time until it diverts into an even less interesting tune. Added to this is some bog-standard delay that adds insult to injury so that we hear each beige motif twice for guaranteed aural boredom. The latter is immaculate tenor sax work from Wayne Shorter, culminating seven minutes into the song with a beautifully simple and gorgeously swelling rise through an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixolydian_mode\">E mixolydian mode</a>, until the music falls apart to be reassembled for the next verse. Another great example is Chet Baker's beautiful trumpet on Elvis Costello's Shipbuilding, which shows how delay can be used to genuinely moving effect. <strong>3. It adds a dash of exoticism</strong> Again, largely a BAD THING. Trying to associate your music with Eastern philosophy by whacking in a tabla solo will be the worst kind of falling between two stools. Please enlighten me as to any genuinely effective uses of a sitar in popular music. <strong>4 - It expands the palette of sounds</strong> You may ask how I separate this from 1 and 3 above? In two ways: the absence of meaningless virtuosity, and the use of the instruments for their individual colour. Was Reg Presley showing off when he took to Wild Thing with his ocarina? Was Syd Barrett trying to impress musos as he honked on his kazoo through Jugband Blues? Probably not. This kind of sonic experimentation, using less conventional instruments without showing off, can be traced from Motown (check out the bassoon on Smokey Robinson's Tears of a Clown) through to Talk Talk (via George Martin's sterling work for the Beatles, of course).</p> <p>Talking of, er, Talk Talk, allow me to single out their Spirit of Eden album as a prime example of using alien-sounding instruments to great effect. There's a total dedication to the sound of the song, over and above the technique. In fact, it is alleged that Nigel Kennedy's violin contributions on that record were made with his fingers taped together to stop any unnecessary noodling. The best bit for me is seven minutes into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCZnXg0vNs0\">The Rainbow</a> where a fluttering sound gradually gains momentum until it reveals itself as a terrifyingly distorted harmonica, wailing out a devastating blues before the strings engulf the track.</p> <p>Expanding instrumentation can work, but it has to be sympathetic to the song. So what is the most out-of-place instrument that works in a pop song? Was there a Bob Dylan outtake featuring a cymbalum, or did Jimmy Page indulge his childhood euphonium lessons on an obscure solo album? Let us know and send us your suggestions.</p>",
  "<p>The five-and-a-half-hour Stockhausen marathon on Saturday was superb. I've always been a little bit ambivalent about Stockhausen \u2013 a lot of his pieces feel like overlong essays on intriguing intellectual concepts that could probably have been put across better on paper. If he had only written, say, Kontakte, or Gruppen, or Stimmung, Stockhausen would be more than welcome to his place among the pantheon of great composers. The Proms organisers were being supremely generous, then, when they programmed all three pieces in a single evening.</p> <p>Gruppen, with its three orchestras, was sensational \u2013 but only if you were a Prommer. Check out the <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/proms/article4452948.ece\">lukewarm reviews</a> from the seated critics if you don't believe me. They have no idea what they were missing out on \u2013 imagine having an orchestra playing two metres away from you on your left, another one playing a metre to your right, and then a third one up on the stage in front of you. That was the layout from where I was standing, and it was one of the most exhilarating experiences I have had in a concert hall. </p> <p>Andrew Clements complained that the performance \"lacked presence\": try telling that to the poor woman who stood too close to the percussion section of orchestra three and ran out clutching her ears halfway through.</p> <p>They did the version of Kontakte for piano, percussion and tape, and while that was also thoroughly enjoyable, it was not as revelatory to hear in a live context as Gruppen was. The other two pieces on the first programme \u2013 a tape work and a solo trumpet piece \u2013 were both from Stockhausen's last cycle of works, Klang, and both suffered from that length problem I mentioned earlier, which made them a bit of a chore to stand through.</p> <p>But the same could not be said for Stimmung, not least because, having only started at 10:15pm, there was enough space in the Arena for me to lie on my back and gaze up at the ceiling. For the uninitiated, Stimmung consists of six singers sitting in a circle and singing a single chord, with the singers changing the shape of their mouths and singing different vowel sounds to produce shifting overtones. It lasts for more than an hour. </p> <p>It's hard to explain why 70 minutes of listening to the same chord was not torturous, but in fact it was as peaceful and as meditative an experience as I have ever had in a concert hall. I felt thoroughly cleansed by it, the musical equivalent of sorbet at the end of a rich and rewarding main course.</p>",
  "<p>According to Arne Ljungqvist, esteemed head of the IOC's medical commission, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/06/olympics2008.china\">the world's athletes have nothing to fear</a> from the haze that has hung over Beijing all week. In his view, expressed publicly to the delight of the Chinese authorities on Tuesday, the yellow-grey fug that has at times this week reduced visibility to a few hundred yards is water vapour and mist, and should in no way be confused with the choking smog that afflicts the city in summer.</p> <p>Now Ljungqvist is not a man to take issue with lightly. He's a bona fide medical doctor for one thing, and has been a pivotal figure in the battle against drugs in sport. Until recently he was a member of the IAAF's ruling council, is a former Swedish junior pole vault champion and is Lord-in-waiting to the King of Sweden to boot. In short, Arne knows his onions, and has an intimate knowledge of what makes athletes tick, and more appositely, what might make them choke.</p> <p>Having spent three days in the city struggling to make out the skyline, and armed with pollution readings from the Beijing Bureau of Environmental Protection that even the Chinese government consider on the high side, it seemed appropriate to check Prof Ljungqvist's assertion with an unscientific test of our own.</p> <p>Armed only with a new pair of trainers (the Olympics only come round every four years, forgive the extravagance) and fuelled by the breakfast of champions (two litres of water and an espresso) the Guardian went for a trot round the Olympic Park that, in 72 hours, will host the first athletes competing for medals.</p> <p>First, a word about the guinea pig. I would not claim to be an athlete, as such. Built more for comfort than speed, I don't so much run as trundle, but I do so on a regular basis, three times-a-week on average, for 30 to 40 minutes at a time. I've never measured exactly how far I get in that time for fear of disappointment, but something between three and four miles seems likely.</p> <p>Paula Radcliffe probably goes further faster to fetch her tea in the morning, but I reasoned it was a suitably rigorous regime to prepare me for a trot from the media centre in the Olympic green, once round the Bird's Nest stadium and then back past the Water Cube.</p> <p>Or perhaps not. Within yards of leaving the air-conditioned comfort of the press room it was clear that these were not my conditions. My usual route runs along the Thames towpath and has much to recommend it, but providing adequate preparation for a run in 30C (86F) heat and 80% humidity is not among them.</p> <p>The main difference is that where I am used to the water being primarily in the river or descending like stair rods, here it hangs in the soupy air. The manufacturers of the running shirt I was sporting claim it is made of a tricksy fibre capable of magically \"wicking\" away moisture. I've never been entirely clear what \"wicking\" is exactly, but it was quickly apparent that my shirt was going to have to wick a lot harder to keep me dry.</p> <p>I began jauntily enough, cruising, so I imagined, suavely past locals who stood mouths agape at my foolishness. I would be lying if I said that after eight minutes or so I wasn't perspiring, but I characterised that as more of a glow than a full-on sweat. Then I caught sight of myself in a passing bus window, a lumbering, puce-faced apparition looking more in need of a doctor than light exercise.</p> <p>After 15 minutes the effects of the debilitating humidity reached my legs, which appeared to double in weight and halve in mobility with every stride. Looking to push the boundaries of enquiry I tried briefly upping the pace and discovered that, whatever Prof Ljungqvist might say, there is no danger of confusing Beijing's atmosphere with that of an Alpine village.</p> <p>It's five years since I smoked a cigarette, but the acrid taste and mild burning at the back of the throat was familiar. By the time I turned for home, having circumnavigated the stadium more slowly than the entire athletes parade will take at Friday's opening ceremony, I was more than ready to stop. A water truck passed by at walking pace spraying the tarmac to keep the dust down, and I would have commandeered it for a shower had I been able to keep up.</p> <p>I looked longingly at the gardeners watering the immaculately-planted beds hoping they might get the message, but they looked back with expressions that said \"Idiot\". As I drew alongside the media centre, the blasts of cool air from open doors were manna, and when I finally pulled up, 35 minutes after departing, the volunteers appeared to be considering summoning medical help.</p> <p>Three bottles of water and a sit down returned my internal thermostat to something approaching normality within around 10 minutes, and within an hour my lungs stopped complaining. I returned to my desk sweatier, thirstier and wiser than when I departed.</p> <p>The official air-quality reading for Beijing today, the average pollution index, was 88, higher than the weekly average figure and close to the 100 that even the Chinese authorities consider dangerous. It was not debilitating but even moderate exertion was a strain. So Arne, you can call it what you like, but one thing I do know: I'm glad I don't have to race in it.</p> <p><strong>Post-script</strong></p> <p>An expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said on Tuesday that if the weather does not change dramatically in the next three days, Beijing will have a \"fairly good\" level of air quality on Friday, the opening day of the Olympics.</p>",

A friend's apprenticeship as a motor technician seemed a good way of turning his hobby into a serious career.</p> <p>\"I've always been interested in motor mechanics, so getting onto a motor technician apprenticeship at VW made sense,\" he says. \"It's a really good course.</p> <p>\"During the first year you cover the basics in every subject related to being a technician and then in the second and third years you gain an understanding of the complexities of each element.\"</p> <p>The apprenticeship leads to NVQs at levels 2 and 3 and supplementary courses to broaden knowledge.</p> <p>\"There's lots of support for my training while I'm working. Whereas training at college you have fifteen students learning from one tutor, here the ratio is reversed.</p> <p>\"Each apprentice is probably working alongside nine or so fully qualified technicians who can answer questions and give guidance. Because everything is so hands on I think you learn more, too,\" he says.</p> <p>Chryssof also receives coaching from <a href=\"http://www.hctc.co.uk/\">VT Training</a>, a company that runs government-funded learning programmes.</p> <p>\"Although the money isn't great while you're training, it's still much better than building up a student debt. And once you're fully qualified then you can do very well.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are three things worse than bad first date sex. One is bad first date sex with a friend. Worse still is when the bad first date sex with a friend becomes bad pillow talk.</p> <p>But what's worse than all of the above? When it all happens twice.</p> <p>We'd managed a nervous second date, Banker and I: three courses (six toilet trips), followed by Teeth, a horror-rape film. Back at his, he turned on the telly: Brazilian football highlights. A night in watching the Fifty Biggest Celebrity Meltdowns with a doner kebab would be have been more romantic.

Freudian psychoanalysis of the above<br>6. Phobia of pregnant bellies<br>7. Money</p> <p>I'm still thinking about number six when we get into bed. He starts layering on enough clothes to survive the Arctic. First, a baggy T-shirt with smiling, yellow pill faces on the front. Next comes nylon: shiny sports shorts and a Wigan Wanderers jersey. I say: \"Off for a jog?\"</p> <p>He stops. Unpeels. Soon after, we're kissing. He's clearly nervous after the first time. I know I am. And as soon as we get to a certain intimate point, it happens again. He, er, loses momentum. </p> <p>I think of saying something. Perhaps that should be added to the list of unmentionables, though (at least until date five). So I slip out to the bathroom. </p> <p>A friend of mine always stopped sex with her boyfriend when they got to a certain point. And it was always during the same position. So on one occasion she decided to explain. Mid-throe: \"Stop objectifying my bottom!\" she yelled. He stopped. And that was that. </p> <p>But there's a different etiquette with near-fianc\u00e9s than with second dates. I slope back from the bathroom hoping he's asleep. <br> <br>Instead, he's pert upright, lamp on. \"Let's talk\", he says</p> <p>\"Ok then ...\"</p> <p>\"Did you know my sister thinks George Bush is prime minister?\"</p> <p>\"Erm, really?!\"<br> <br>Soon it's 4am. We've chewed over devolved government politics, narrowly avoiding Boris talk. He's still speaking:</p> <p>\"My grandad points an imaginary air rifle at the telly and - bam - fires it whenever a black person, or an Asian or a German crosses the screen.\"</p> <p>I'm speechless. I wonder why Anne Frank's Diary is on his bedside table. Then he says: \"Tell me something about your family.\"<br> <br>A friend of mine used to sing advert tunes in bed because she didn't like silence. Then her boyfriend - a TV cameraman for X-rated channels \u2013 realised what she was doing. </p> <p>I don't know what to say, so I start humming. We listen for a bit. I realise my melody is the Bisto theme. I can hear his head shift on the pillow towards me. His mouth opens to speak. Oh hell. Quickly I say:<br> <br>\"Have I told you about my Dad?\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>10.45am</strong> Pretty miserable morning, but given the lousy forecast it's a pleasant surprise that the captains have tossed, and play is due to start promptly with Lancashire batting after Chris Adams called incorrectly, <em>writes Andy Wilson at Old Trafford</em>. This has tended to be a heavyweight battle in recent seasons between two counties who have often finished first (Sussex) and second (Lancashire), with the last two meetings at Aigburth in Liverpool described as having Test match intensity.</p> <p>But Sussex go into their first championship match in Manchester since 2004 down in sixth in the table, with Lancashire one point and one position above them, having played a game fewer. Having said that the leaders Nottinghamshire are only 18 points ahead of Sussex in the congested First Division table, and they and all the other title hopefuls will note nervously that Mushtaq Ahmed returns to the Sussex team today after a second knee operation. Old Trafford pitches have traditionally suited leg-spinners, so Stuart Law will doubtless be relieved to have won that toss and avoided having to bat last.</p> <p>Lancs are unchanged from their last championship match, a home draw against Hampshire, while there is one new name in the Sussex team - Michael Thornely, a 21-year-old opener from Horsham who makes his debut in place of Michael Yardy, who has a shoulder injury. Jason Lewry is preferred to Corey Collymore and might fancy himself to find some swing in sticky conditions.</p> <p><strong>11.30am</strong> The sun's out at the Rose Bowl but there will be no play until at least noon when the umpires next inspect, <em>writes Mike Averis</em>. Overnight rain has, apparently, made the outfield unplayable.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> Lunch at Old Trafford, and Lancashire 59 for four, which sounds pretty grim but actually represents a minor recovery, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. As has already been noted down below, Jason Lewry did indeed find the conditions to his liking. First he exposed Lou Vincent's inability to play the swinging ball, raising further questions about Lancashire's decision to employ the New Zealander as their overseas player for the rest of this season. If that was a fairly orthodox delivery for the left arm over bowler that a decent opener should have coped with - as Paul Horton had already proved - then Iain Sutcliffe could not be blamed as he was squared up and lost his off stump to Lewry's next delivery. Stuart Law survived the hat-trick with aplomb and played patiently and cleverly until a short rain break.</p> <p>However by then Lewry had struck again with a clever piece of bowling, angling one across Horton to have Lancashire's consistent young opener caught behind. That was 16 for three, but given Law's prolific record against Sussex over the years, the visitors would still not have been entirely happy. That changed when Luke Wright replaced Lewry from the Stretford End and suckered Lancashire's captain into a loose drive, with Matt Prior taking a good low catch diving towards first slip. Francois du Plessis, who looked lucky to survive a loud lbw appeal from the first delivery he faced, from Lewry, and Steven Croft did well to see Lancashire through until lunch as Mushtaq started to twirl dangerously from the Statham End.</p> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> We've just had an extraordinary session here. Somerset looked likely to get bowled out before lunch - and there was a late start following rain. It's very damp in the West Country and both sides were clearly determined to make as much progress as they could in the time available to them. Don't you love this short-form cricket?</p> <p>Nottinghamshire, looking to extend their lead at the top of the table with their fifth victory, won the toss on a pitch which looked as though it needed a shave. Off the last ball of the third over Justin Langer was lbw to one that swung in from Charlie Shreck. In the next over Marcus Trescothick was caught by the diving Mark Ealham in the gully off Darren Pattinson: two for two and their best batsmen gone.</p> <p>It didn't get much better. Zander de Bruyn, who had been dropped on six, made only three more before he was caught at third slip, driving at a length ball from Pattinson and it was 24 for four when Peter Trego had his off bail trimmed by Andre Adams.</p> <p>Ian Blackwell was fifth out at 25, when he turned a delivery from Pattinson straight to square-leg, and when James Hildreth was sixth out at 35, caught at first slip playing a poor stroke, Somerset looked in danger of under-cutting their lowest ever score against Notts, which is 62. There was just time for Somerset to lose another one before the interval. Craig Kieswetter, defending, lost his middle-stump and the home side, who are third in the table themselves, lunched on 59 for seven.</p> <p><strong>3.50pm</strong> Tea at Old Trafford, and Sussex still well on top, with Lancashire 147 for seven, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. Each of the three wickets that have fallen in the afternoon session has gone to Ollie Rayner, the tall off-spinner who has been really impressive - although he could hardly have asked for better conditions, with a biscuit-coloured pitch already offering plenty of turn and the Lancashire batsmen perhaps relaxing after combating Mushtaq's box of tricks from the other end.</p> <p>Rayner's first wicket was a gift, as Francois du Plessis squandered an hour's hard graft by top-edging a sweep. Steven Croft, who offered further encouraging evidence of his development in a patient 46, edged an arm ball to slip where he was snapped up by Chris Adams, and Glen Chapple also poked a catch to slip - although he was taken by Jason Lewry, as Adams had briefly left the field.</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Yorkshire, without a win in the championship since early June, were struggling at tea on the first day at the Rose Bowl, <em>writes Mike Averis</em>. After losing the morning because overnight rain had left the outfield unfit, Yorkshire took 38 overs in the afternoon to get to 77 for three - and that was after something of a late burst of scoring.</p> <p>Watched by the likes of Barry Richards and Gordon Greenidge, back in town for a reunion of Hampshire old boys, Yorkshire took 28 overs to pass 50 after winning the toss and electing to bat. By then they had lost Andrew Gale to the fifth ball of the innings, a rising delivery from Chris Tremlett which ballooned off the shoulder the bat to Dimitri Mascarenhas running in from gully, and Anthony McGrath in the 12th over with the score at 17 for two.</p> <p>McGrath, back after three weeks nursing a hamstring, took 38 balls over his three runs - not all his fault because there was plenty of stuff he did not have to play - before he was trapped on the crease and lbw to a delivery from Mascarenhas which nipped back into his pads.</p> <p>Once Christopher Taylor and Jacques Rudolph had passed 50 there was a slight blip in the run rate, but then Taylor's patient innings - nearly two hours for 27 - ended with a delivery from James Tomlinson which slid across his bat and on to the keeper.</p> <p><strong>5pm</strong> Somerset haven't been the luckiest lot today, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Taunton</em>. Having been bowled out for 106 in 39.1 overs the sun has come out and the pitch has flattened out a bit.</p> <p>They've just resumed after tea and the Nottinghamshire batsmen are bearing down on that total with six wickets in hand. Mark Wagh went a while ago, caught at square-leg after failing to keep down a ball that was well pitched up on middle-and-leg. Then Adam Voges was out lbw, but at 89-4 Notts are still bossing the game.</p> <p>Earlier, the ball swung and seamed but not enough to excuse some rather shoddy batting from Somerset. Darren Pattinson took 5-40 and and Andre Adams 4-39 and the best Somerset score was Steffan Jones' unbeaten 27.</p> <p>When Notts batted the ball was still doing a bit but Somerset did not bowl as well. There were too many fours hit off the back foot for the liking of Justin Langer, the Somerset captain. Matt Wood, the former Somerset player, was caught at first slip off Andrew Caddick and Bilal Shafayat was bowled by an inswinger from Peter Trego.</p> <p>The crowd is really disappointing for such an important game. I know the weather is a bit dodgy but so far we've lost only the first five minutes of the day.</p>",
  "<p>Is it a blip, or is the tide going out? After 30 years when it seemed that nothing could reverse the glacially slow yet inexorable progress towards a world where it was taken for granted that women and men would have equality in their life and work, academics at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/06/equality.gender\">Cambridge</a> have found that support for the idea that mothers can go out to work without harming their families is falling, and support for the view that men are the breadwinners and women the carers is rising. </p> <p>What is going on? Lacking the resources (not to mention the skills) to organise the kind of global survey that underpins these findings, one can only look around and take a wild guess. And when you look around, you see the following: young women leaving school or university with grades as good as their male peers but choosing to take lower-paid work, because they don't see pay as a kind of virility symbol and anyway they aren't too worried about virility symbols.</p> <p>You see little change in who does what at home. And financial pressure, now allied with financial insecurity, is leading to desperate anxiety about paying the bills and keeping the job, which equals ever-longer hours at the coalface. This is not an environment for people with major responsibilities outside the workplace. And that's still women, women with children and women with elderly parents.</p> <p>This is an unfinished revolution. Great leaps towards equality have been taken in my working lifetime, but only in the abstract. Now, young men and women set off at least superficially from the same starting line. But 10 years on in their lives, progress towards father's and mother's equality, the fair division of work and caring, is almost non-existent.</p> <p>Maybe that's unkind. It's great that there's now paternity leave, and serious progress on ideas about sharing parental leave between parents. Less great that it relies on employers to make it a financially sensible option. All the same, the legislation of the past 10 years has cleared a narrow path towards the sunlit uplands of genuine equality.</p> <p>But there are plenty of elephant traps along the way. As Nicola Brewer, chief executive of the new <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/aboutus/whoweare/pages/whoweare.aspx\">Equalities and Human Rights Commission</a>, warned in an interview recently, there is a real risk that the legislation intended to protect and promote gender equality will end up with too many employers finding reasons for not taking on women of child bearing age, while extending maternity leave merely reinforces notions of gender segregation.</p> <p>For all the nominal gains, women are actually little nearer genuine equality than they were in the 1980s. We have fought, and we have not won. Partly, that's because a lot of us still expect too little of ourselves. But maybe something else, something more positive, is going on here too. It was a cliche of 1980s sociology that when the costs of motherhood became apparent, then fewer women would want to become mothers. </p> <p>A generation on, women and men are beginning to reverse the argument, to point out the rewards and responsibilities of parenthood, and the need for carers in society. We may still be years behind northern Europe, but slowly it is dawning on us all that bringing up the kids is an amazingly important (and rewarding) thing to do, precious beyond the pay packet. The more complex and important a task child-rearing is understood to be, the more one parent is going to want to forsake their full-on career in order to stay home, at least some of the time. </p> <p>Since the idea of real equality in the workplace probably has at least another generation to go before it is a reality, and other <a href=\"http://www.genet.ac.uk/workpapers/GeNet2006p21.pdf\">work (pdf)</a> by Professor Jacqueline Scott, who edited the book published today, has underlined the resilience of traditional attitudes to families, it's the mothers who are assumed, not least by themselves, to be responsible for the caring bit. </p> <p>One day that will change. But for the time being, it may be the reason why attitudes appear to have gone into reverse: people have understood the question in a different way. It's not the career that really matters, stoopid, it's the caring.</p>",
  "<p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the celebrated Russian writer, has been laid to rest after a funeral service held at Moscow's historic Donskoi monastery earlier today. </p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and his predecessor, Vladimir Putin, were among the mourners who joined the Nobel laureate's family and friends for the service in the monastery's cathedral. </p> <p>After the Russian Orthodox ceremony,which included goose-stepping honour guards and a choir singing dirges, his flower-strewn casket was carried to a grave in the cathedral's cemetery preceded by a uniformed soldier carrying a huge photograph of the man. </p> <p>At the graveside a priest said prayers and blessed his body before sprinkling it with frankincense. Relatives kissed his forehead before the coffin was sealed and interred.</p> <p>He was buried in accordance with his will in the monastery grounds, where Russian cultural figures have been laid to rest since the 18th century. </p> <p>According to observers, the service bore all the hallmarks of a state funeral, including a military band and a gun salute. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, the Russian public paid tribute to the author, who died from heart failure on Sunday aged 89.</p> <p>Flanked by his widow, Natalya, two sons Stepan and Yermolai, and a military guard, his body lay in an open coffin inside the Russian Academy of sciences, as thousands of mourners trouped past offering their condolences and placing flowers on the floor by the coffin. </p> <p>Solzhenitsyn came to prominence with his books The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich which exposed Stalin's brutal prison system and forced him into 20 years of exile from the former Soviet Union.</p>",
  "<p>Team GB's Olympic preparations ground to a halt today when their training camp in Macau was caught in the midst of a typhoon. The typhoon was monitored as a category eight, which, by law, obliged all shops, offices and public transport to be closed. Powerful winds and torrential rain hit the region as severe tropical storm Kammuri also hit Hong Kong.</p> <p>However, Graham Newsom, Team GB's spokesman, maintained that they had put effective contingency plans into action and the athletes remained unconcerned. \"It's not a huge issue, it was within our contingency plans. It was something that was accounted for,\" said Newsom. \"We're making the best use of the indoor facilities and some sports have decided to use this as a rest day so they have shuffled their schedules a little bit. We're all very comfortable and we've been resourceful in our thinking.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, the morning equestrian session was suspended, although it is not believed that the event's start on Saturday is under threat as the storm is expected to have dissipated by then. \"The reports I've had from the grooms that are down there said there is nothing untoward and the horses are fine,\" said the Team GB equestrian spokeswoman Winnie Murphy. \"I haven't been to the venue as everything is locked down due to the typhoon but the way the stables work it is very enclosed and the horses are unlikely to hear anything outside,\" said Murphy. \"We have been told the typhoon will be downgraded to level three later this afternoon and if that is the case and we can still ride this evening then we won't really have lost anything training wise.\"</p> <p>Heptathlete Kelly Sotherton also played down the severity of the situation. \"You can't do anything about it but it's something that happens and affects everybody. I'm not too bothered about it because I could do with the day off,\" she insisted. \"We can't leave the hotel because when there's a typhoon at this Level 8 all the transport is cancelled, so unfortunately we are all holed up in a hotel. It's similar to a hurricane and it's not as bad as it has been but it's torrential rain and high winds. We are right by the coast so the sea is very rough.\"</p> <p>However, the extreme weather has forced the members of the squad who were yet to arrive at the training camp to amend their travel arrangements. \"Athletes that are flying in tonight have been booked into accommodation in Hong Kong overnight,\" Newsom said. \"We're hopeful of getting some athletes out tonight up to Beijing but if not, they'll go tomorrow.\"</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another data scandal. Millions of consumers have had their details stolen by an international gang of hackers. Another reminder that anything that makes transactions easier also makes them more risky. Even in the USA, the land of the ID card.</p> <p>This weekend I was on a street stall outside Islington farmers' market with other supporters of <a href=\"http://www.no2id.net/\">NO2ID</a>. Farmers' markets are the antithesis of the global, electronic marketplace. Face-to-face transactions, hand-grown produce handed over in exchange for hard cash, dealing directly with the producer - a welcome exception to the online, supermarketed, call-centre world in which we now live. So a perfect place to raise the ID card question. </p> <p>Despite the showery weather, a steady stream of people, some already armed with soft fruit and handmade cheese, lined up to sign our petition or debate the issue. We're finding that more and more people are backing the campaign; they just don't buy the idea of a massive, flawless, and wholly secure database. Disasters like <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7530180.stm\">the loss of 3,000 blank passports</a> don't help. </p> <p>I've been opposed to ID cards from day one. It's not just <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/noidcards/\">my gut objections as a Liberal Democrat to the loss of freedom</a>. As a software professional in my day job, I know both the benefits and weaknesses that any database brings. Ideological objections aside, uniting financial, legal and health records, plus biometric data, on every citizen, will require a monster of a system. What happens when everyone tries to swipe their cards at once? Try hiring a car on the first day of term, or renewing a prescription on election day. </p> <p>The government could argue that ID cards would make life more convenient, despite the risk, and offer an optional ID card, with citizens making an informed choice. Or they could argue that it's an inconvenient necessity in the face of terrorist threats, imposed to deal with national security. What is so dishonest is that government is claiming that ID cards will simultaneously make us safer <em>and</em> life easier - when the reality already shows that the opposite is the case. </p> <p>Add in the massive cost of the scheme - \u00a318bn and rising - and the question is not why so many people oppose ID cards, but why the government is still in favour.</p> <p>It's not as if existing systems are foolproof. A few weeks ago, I was heading out of London by train for a family celebration. We got waved through the barrier at King's Cross - \"a birthday present from Boris\" we joked - and thought no more about it. In fact we'd just avoided having our Oyster travel cards destroyed by a bug in the system. </p> <p>For anyone who lives or works in London, the Oyster card is now a fact of life. Like many others, I load mine up with pre-payment and try not to worry about my movements being tracked. Barclays have combined it with a cashcard; Oyster has even been used to provide alibis. We all love our Oyster cards - or did. </p> <p>But since the July 12 meltdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/26/transport.london\">the Oyster network has failed again</a>. And there's also been the revelation on the internet of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/26/hitechcrime.oystercards\">how to break the security of the Oyster chip</a>. It's a reality check that no matter how handy a smartcard is - and I wouldn't be without my Oyster - there's no 100% secure system. </p> <p>If the government does want to pay billions of our money to IT contractors, why not use it to make the existing systems up to scratch? </p> <p>An old joke goes that there are two universal lies: \"The cheque is in the post\" and \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help\". Just this week I had a desperate phone call from a woman caught in the twilight zone between different benefit claims. She'd phoned the benefits office, to be assured that her giro was in the post. It never arrived and she was running out of food money. </p> <p>Another visit to the office, and it turned out they'd sent it to a different address on the same street, despite all the forms she's filled in over the years. Ah the mighty power of the database state ...</p>",
  "<p>The moment of truth is at hand for US biofuels this week as environmental regulators prepare to rule on one state's request to halve the steep national target for blending ethanol into fuel.</p> <p>Texas governor Rick Perry asked the US environmental protection agency (EPA) in April to cut the national biofuels target 50% from its current level of 9bn gallons. After an unexpected delay last month, the EPA is expected to rule on Perry's waiver request as soon as this week.</p> <p>The waiver proposal has stoked a fierce political row over the future of biofuels, with some US politicians echoing their European counterparts in questioning whether ethanol's effect on food prices limits its usefulness as an alternative to traditional fuel.</p> <p>\"We need to put an end to flawed government policies that distort the markets, raise food prices artificially, and pit producers against consumers,\" senator John McCain said in May after he and 23 fellow Republicans endorsed an easing of the ethanol target. </p> <p>Three major environmental groups have even sided with the conservative governor \u2013 albeit with different motives than Perry, who sought the waiver to protect Texas livestock producers from rising corn prices. </p> <p>Suspending the biofuels target would allow the EPA the environmental sustainability of increased ethanol production, according to Friends of the Earth energy policy campaigner Kate McMahon.</p> <p>\"This biofuels mandate essentially dictates inaction on climate change by taking us in a useless and potentially harmful direction,\" McMahon said in a statement last month.</p> <p>Yet powerful supporters of increased ethanol production hail from nearly every corn-producing state in the US, including an Illinois senator named Barack Obama. In his energy plan released this week, the Democratic presidential nominee sets a 60bn-gallon target within 22 years for advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol.</p> <p>The ethanol industry's US trade group, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), asserts that the carbon footprint of ethanol \u2013 already lower than that of conventional petrol \u2013 will only decrease as the ethanol target encourages the development of advanced biofuel.</p> <p>\"We're doing everything we can, as efficiently as we can, to bring those technologies to the marketplace,\" RFA spokesman Matt Hartwig said. </p> <p>\"But if you go in and undermine the foundation of the ethanol industry today, you'll set back the development of those next-generation technologies.\"</p> <p>That more and more US corn is being diverted to make ethanol is not in dispute. The US agriculture department estimates that 25% of the nation's corn crop, valued at $52.1bn, was used for fuel last year. That number could rise as high as 35% this year.</p> <p>But the ethanol industry argues that high oil prices, not biofuels, are to blame for food prices that have risen far faster than inflation. </p> <p>Only one-quarter of recent US corn price increases are attributable to the ethanol tax credit \u2013 recently reduced by Congress from 51 cents to 45 cents per gallon \u2013 according to a Purdue University study commissioned by the Farm Foundation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy\">confidential World Bank report</a> obtained by the Guardian last month, however, tagged biofuels as the cause of a 75% rise in worldwide food prices.</p> <p>The EPA's delay in ruling on the Texas waiver request, which sparked more than 15,000 public comments to the agency, raised concerns among those on both sides of the biofuels battle. </p> <p>Eight senators from corn-producing states publicly warned EPA administrator Stephen Johnson against \"any agreements being made behind closed doors\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, some commodity watchers predicted that falling corn prices this summer would give the agency grounds to deny the waiver.</p> <p>No matter what the EPA decides in coming days, the battle may not end right away. Biofuels supporters are likely to challenge any potential waiver in court, and Perry appears to have laid the groundwork for a lawsuit against the agency if his request is denied.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://carboncontrolnews.com/\">Carbon Control News</a>, Perry wrote in comments to the EPA that the law requires a waiver of the ethanol target \"whenever [Johnson] is able to make a reasonable determination that a major sacrifice would flow from the implementation of the mandates\".</p>",

It was halted when his hotel asked reporters to leave, but public security officials waiting at the venue did not intervene directly or approach the man when he left the building.</p> <p>The video began with an introduction by Dechen Pemba, a Briton of Tibetan descent deported from the capital last month for \"splittist activities\". At the time, she said she had been in China solely in a private capacity and was not involved in any organisations.</p> <p>The Tibet issue has dogged the Olympics since March's violent riots in<br>Lhasa and wider protests across Tibetan areas led to a security clampdown. Activists responded with demonstrations along the international leg of the torch relay, in turn sparking anger among the Chinese and making them all the keener to focus on celebrations as the flame returned to the capital.</p> <p>Other protests today included a low-key demonstration by three<br>Americans who stood in Tiananmen Square - well after the torch had passed through - to shout a denunciation of China's population control policies. Police allowed them to leave the area after questioning them briefly.</p> <p>Journalists received messages summoning them to two hotel rooms in Beijing containing dummies splattered with red paint. The walls had been defaced with slogans including: \"One World, Our Nightmare\" - a play on the Olympic \"One World, One Dream\" message - and a list of jailed dissidents. It was not clear who carried out the protest.</p> <p>The US swimmer Amanda Beard, an Athens 2004 gold medallist, unveiled an anti-fur advert outside the Olympic village after the authorities prevented her from her staging a news conference in a hotel for \"safety\" reasons.</p> <p>The government has designated zones for protest in parks around the city, but human rights campaigners warn that Chinese citizens will be deterred from taking part by the fear of reprisals and several groups have already been denied permits.</p> <p>Other activists have been unable to enter the country. Team Darfur, a coalition of athletes seeking to draw attention to the conflict in Sudan, said that Beijing yesterday revoked the visa of its co-founder and Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek.</p> <p>He called the decision \"part of a systemic effort by the Chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of Darfur\".</p> <p>Activists argue China has the greatest leverage of any nation over Khartoum because of its oil purchases from and arms sales to the government. Emmanuelle Moreau, an International Olympic Committee spokeswoman, said organisers should expect people to use the platform of the Olympics to draw attention to their causes.</p> <p>She said: \"The IOC are confident Beijing city authorities will assess the<br>situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding.\"</p>",

  "<p>Swiss miner Xstrata made a $10bn (\u00a35bn) takeover bid today for Lonmin, the world's third-biggest platinum producer, in an attempt to grab a bigger share of the mining industry.</p> <p>Xstrata, which is the fifth-largest mining group by market value, said it planned to launch a cash offer at \u00a333 a share, a 42% premium on Lonmin's closing share price of \u00a323.19 yesterday. Seizing Lonmin, which was once part of Tiny Rowland's Lonrho empire, would help Xstrata diversify its business and give it control of its platinum mines in South Africa.</p> <p>\"Today's announcement marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio,\" chief executive Mick Davis said.</p> <p>But Lonmin hit back this morning, calling the bid an \"opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire Lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets\".</p> <p>Davis told Reuters that the mining firm was looking to buy more shares in Lonmin after releasing the bid offer. Xstrata has already bought 8% of Lonmin shares.</p> <p>News of the deal sent Lonmin's shares soaring on the FTSE this morning, up 46% to \u00a333.90. Xstrata also enjoyed gains of 0.8% or 25p to \u00a332.25.</p> <p>Davis also revealed that he had got in touch with senior managers at the London-based <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/25/lonmin.mining\">Lonmin</a> last night.</p> <p>Xstrata believes it can turn around the South African mines owned by Lonmin, which has repeatedly cut its production targets due to operational problems and power shortages.</p> <p>Davis pointed out that Xstrata's sales have lifted more than 17-fold in the past five years through acquisitions and expansions in copper, nickel and coal. Through Lonmin, Xstrata aims to expand its range of metals output to include platinum, which is used to make catalytic converters for vehicles. </p> <p>Coal is one of its biggest areas of business after copper. Xstrata is the world's largest energy-coal exporter, and analysts have said that the miner's strong cash-flow puts it in a good position to launch another takeover.</p> <p>The offer comes as the miner posted a 2% rise in first-half net profit to $2.83bn, higher than analyst forecasts of $2.65bn.</p> <p>Lonmin has also been delivering robust profits, boosted by record platinum prices. But in the past few months platinum prices have fallen by a third from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/04/marketturmoil.oil\">the record of $2,290 an ounce in March</a>, dragging Lonmin shares with them. Before today's surge, its shares had tumbled 36% since touching a peak in May.</p>",
  "<p>Frequent infestations of rats, mice, fleas, bedbugs, ants and cockroaches plague most NHS hospitals in England, figures released today show.</p> <p>More than two-thirds (70%) of NHS trusts brought in pest controllers at least 50 times over the past two years to combat outbreaks of vermin in wards, clinics and even operating theatres, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.</p> <p>There were almost 20,000 incidents of pest infestation in hospitals between January 2006 and March this year, the figures obtained by the Conservatives reveal. The outbreaks included rats in maternity wards, wasps and fleas in neonatal units and maggots in patients' slippers. </p> <p>The figures show four-fifths (80%) of NHS trusts reported problems with ants, two-thirds (66%) with rats and more than three-quarters (77%) with mice. </p> <p>Cockroaches were said to have been reported at 59% of trusts, fleas or other biting insects at two-thirds (65%), and bed bugs at nearly a quarter (24%). A further 6% of trusts reported infestations of maggots.</p> <p>The Patients Association described the situation as revolting and said it threatened patient safety. The government said the risk to patients was \"negligible\" and played down fears that infestations of vermin were linked to the spread of hospital superbugs such as MRSA.</p> <p>All 171 NHS trusts in England were asked to detail pest infestations by the Conservatives. Of the 127 that responded, almost all said they had experienced some problems. </p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, said: \"Labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing. </p> <p>\"It is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest-free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning. We need greater transparency in NHS infection control, and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards.\" </p> <p>Vanessa Bourne, of the Patients Association, said: \"Such findings are truly revolting. How can patients be safe amid bed bugs, fleas and rats? Once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients, particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity. </p> <p>\"What about those trusts who ignored this freedom of information request and said nothing? If these are the standards of those coming clean, what does it say about those who stayed silent? These findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent. If these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business. [NHS] trust boards must get a grip and show patients they are serious about their legal responsibility for safety.\" </p> <p>Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which had the highest number of pest incidents over the period (see list below), said the figure reflected the fact that it was the fourth-largest trust in the country. John Simpson, the trust's director of estates and facilities management, said it was not fair to compare its figures with those of smaller trusts, which were likely to have smaller-scale pest problems. </p> <p>Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust, which had the third most incidents, said the figure reflected how seriously staff regarded pest control. </p> <p>\"Common calls in Portsmouth are to deal with ants or, being a coastal city, dead seagulls or pigeons in the grounds,\" a spokeswoman said. \"The number of help-desk calls is not a reflection on cleanliness in our hospitals, more a recognition that we do not procrastinate with our response.\"</p> <p>Christine Braithwaite, the head of the healthcare associated infection programme at the Healthcare Commission, said concerns around pest control in hospitals \"have, to date, been negligible\".</p> <p>Ivan Lewis, the health minister, said it was up to NHS trusts to ensure hospitals were clean and safe for patients. He said there was little evidence of any threat to patient safety. </p> <p>\"The use of pest control is seen as good, proactive management,\" he said. \"The claim that insects spread hospital-acquired infections is entirely unproven. There is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients. Despite this, we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems.\"</p> <p>Malcolm Padley, a spokesman for Rentokil, which provides pest control for hospitals, said some pests could be brought in by patients. \"We have definitely seen an increase in the number of callouts about bed bugs and rodents nationally. A lot of people could be going into hospitals with bed bugs on their clothing.\"</p> <p><strong>The 10 NHS trusts that called in pest controllers most often between January 2006 and April 2008: </strong></p> <p>1. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust: 1,070 incidents <br>2. Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust: 898 incidents <br>3. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust: 857 incidents <br>4. Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust: 855 incidents <br>5. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust: 813 incidents <br>6. Barts and the London NHS Trust: 801 incidents <br>7. York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: 690 incidents <br>8. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust: 658 incidents <br>9. Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust: 450 incidents <br>10. East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust: 416 incidents</p>",

  "<p><br>Just super ... the cast of Heroes. Photograph: NBC</p> <p>Spoiler alert! Although maybe it's not a spoiler at all. Either way, let's plough ahead. Entertainment Weekly is reporting that <a href=\"http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/exclusive-rober.html\">Robert Forster will be appearing in series three of Heroes</a> as the supposedly dead Arthur Petrelli, father of Nathan and Peter.</p> <p>You may think you don't know who Robert Forster is, but you do. He was the star of Quentin Tarantino's last great film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55hCTT6saCk\">Jackie Brown</a>. (Well, he didn't play Jackie Brown, but you know what I mean: he was the fantastically deadpan Max Cherry.)</p> <p>But that's not important. What is important is that this leak means the head of the Petrelli household has either been alive all along, or has been brought back to life for season three (AKA \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgVxHVc2XZM\">Villains</a>\").</p> <p>Obsessive bloggers are already tying the loose threads together in order to fit this new revelation into their masterplan. For instance, Cristina Rose hints <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/video/soundbites?bcpid=1670076574&amp;bclid=1675979522&amp;bctid=1680571118\">in this video interview</a> that Angela has a secret power which will be revealed early on in the new season. Could it be she can bring people - including her husband - back from the dead?</p> <p>However, before we all start hyperventilating, Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello rightly points out in his next breath that there could be a very straightforward explanation, given the tendency of the plot to flip flop through time. In other words, it may just be that he's going to appear in some flashback sequences.</p> <p>But don't let a little bit of cold logic put you off. If you want some more season three spoilers, you can check the <a href=\"http://www.heroesrevealed.com/cast/heroes-season-3-spoilers/\">Heroes Revealed spoilers page</a>. (Do I need to say SPOILER ALERT again? Probably. Even though they're more likely to all be unsubstantiated rumours.)</p> <p>While we're trying to second-guess the new twists, YouTube is full of dreadful fan-made fake trailers, but NBC have at least released <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxLwEFi6ddE\">this very brief teaser</a>.</p> <p>In the meantime, you can catch up on the backstory with the really rather decent online plot-filler <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/evolutions/\">Heroes Evolutions</a> . It might not tell you anything earth shattering, but at least it's been officially endorsed.</p>",
  "<p>With only days to go before the start of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">Beijing Olympics</a>, the authorities in China have taken every possible precaution to sanitise the city. \"Undesirable elements\", which might provoke pro-Tibet or pro-Taiwan protests have been moved out or arrested. Special parks have been designated where any protesters can be carefully herded and corralled by large numbers of police and security forces during the games. Even the ever-present <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/15/china.olympicgames2008\">pollution</a> has been tackled by removing over 1 million vehicles from Beijing's streets every day and closing down thousands of factories in the suburbs. An eerie calm has settled over the city in excited anticipation of the opening of the games. Not even the barking of dogs is allowed to disturb this strangely tranquil scene. Large dogs have been banned in Beijing and armies of dog-catchers patrol the streets \"arresting\" pet dogs that are any bigger than a Chihuahua or a terrier, often wrestling them from their owners and taking them to a huge warehouse on the city outskirts, where row after row of cramped cages house the forlorn beasts.</p> <p>China's attitude to animals is ambiguous to say the least. While there is a growing middle class that likes to own cats and dogs as pets, there are still tens of millions who regard them as only of value for food or fur. Alarmingly, the growing affluence of the Chinese has led to an increased demand for cat and dog meat and fur. Dogs and cats are on sale daily in meat markets across China. They are <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-528694/Olympics-clean-Chinese-style-Inside-Beijings-shocking-death-camp-cats.html\">beaten to death</a>, boiled alive, stabbed and strangled on the spot, or cruelly bound with wire and stuffed into sacks to be slaughtered at restaurants. There is also a burgeoning fur trade, with an estimated <a href=\"http://www.hsus.org/hsi/dogs_and_cats/street_animal_welfare/roundup_beijings_cats_31108.html\">two million cats</a> and dogs horrifically killed every year to supply Europe with parka-hood trims, ski boot and glove linings, fur coats and rugs and even toy animals for the tourist trade.</p> <p>After nine years of campaigning with <a href=\"http://www.hsus.org/hsi/\">Humane Society International</a>, I successfully steered legislation through the European parliament which will ban the import, export and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6765653.stm\">trade in cat and dog fur</a> in all 27 EU member states from January 1 next year. This news did not go down well in China. When I met with animal welfare minister Li Yucai and his team at his offices in Beijing last year he said that he could not guarantee that China would stop the trade in cat and dog fur. Amazingly he then went on to deny that all two million cats and dogs that I had mentioned would be skinned alive. \"There is no economic advantage in skinning animals alive\" he said. </p> <p>The minister tried to justify his position by saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Chinese government has worked hard to improve conditions and welfare for animals. Existing laws allow the captive breeding of animals. But China is different from elsewhere as we use wildlife products in traditional Chinese medicines. We have moved from using wildlife to captive resources for this purpose. However, skinning animals alive is not a common practice in China. </p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly we have touched a raw nerve with the Chinese government on this issue and despite the successful implementation of our EU ban there remains much work to be done to convince the Chinese to put a stop to this horrific business once and for all. </p> <p>As we settle down to watch the opening of the Beijing Olympics we should spare a thought for the many millions of dogs and cats that are bred or rounded up in China, crammed into tiny cages and loaded onto trucks to be transported for days under hellish conditions to live animal markets. Here they are bludgeoned to death, strangled, bled our or often boiled alive. Worse still, their death often comes slowly because of the mistaken belief that torture improves taste. In the west we regard companion animals not only as our best friends, but also as part of the family. Sadly this is not the case in China.</p>",
